He enjoys going bye bye and being tucked in my jacket as I work.  He sleeps on my pillow or under my chin.  He loves other little dogs and is likely too much for a senior pet to deal with He is fine with cats. I don\u2019t usually pee pad train the dogs however he is so little that I cheated this time!  He can be a bit of a drama queen (whines) if he wants down and you don\u2019t read his mind and help him at once.  He\u2019s a dreamboat!\nHis forever home requirements are: \nNo small children\nAnother friendly small dog \nSomeone home most of the time\nGraceful movers so not to step on him \nImpeccable vet reference \nI have not crated him \nNo apartments please \nHe is neutered vaccinated dewormed flea treated and chipped.  \nIf you have never applied to adopt we ask that you make a $25 nonrefundable donation that helps care for the animals.  Although we try, everyone  may not hear back from us.  We are not first come first serve.  We choose the best home for each dog. \nPayPal.me/spayitforward\nCopy and paste for application if you have what he needs https://forms.gle/i6vCT6447Eew8NCg9\n\n\n\n\n\n",

She is shy at first but warms up for attention. She is good with kids.\n\nIt will be a couple of weeks before she is ready for a new home.\n\n\n\nTHIS  IS NOT A WORKING DOG AND WILL NOT BE PLACED AS ONE. IT WOULD BREAK THE DOG'S HEART.\n\n\nTHE APPLICATION PROCESS CAN BE FOUND ON OUR WEBSITE AT\nhttp://www.nepyresq.org/page/adoption-process-47.html.OUR DOGS ARE IN FOSTER HOMES ACROSS THE NORHTEAST. AFTER YOU ARE APPROVED YOU WILL BE GIVEN THE CONTACT INFORMATION FOR THE FOSTERS SO YOU CAN GO MEET THE DOG (S) .\n\nYOU CAN NOT TRAIN A PYRENEES TO STAY IN YOUR YARD WITHOUT A FENCE. IT IS IN THIER NATURE. IF YOU WANT A DOG TO WALK OFF LEASH WITH YOU THIS IS NOT THE BREED FOR YOU.\n\nThe adoption fee is $400 due to cost of medical needs of our dogs. $450 for Dogs 12 months and under. You will receive a copy of their medical records when you adopt.\n\nIf you have never had a Pyr Puppy you need to read this : http://www.nepyresq.org/page/i-want-a-great-pyrenees-puppy-50.html.\n\nWe DO NOT accept INVISIBLE fencing for the following reasons:\n1) Most Pyrs ignore the pain and go through it.\n2) This is a guardian breed and this fencing does not keep people or other animals out of your yard. The Pyr could take them as a threat or be attacked by them.\n\nMost of these dogs are not a dog park breed. They bark a lot and can bother your neighbors.",

Unfortunately, Scout became the \"ring leader\" of the packs trips away from the home. His family thought he would do better with family that had a nice big fenced yard. Scout is a giant snuggle buddy. When he is with you he just melts into you and soaks up all the attention and cuddles. He likes to play fetch with soccer balls and Frisbees. No cats for this guy. \n\n\nLink to our online adoption application:\nhttp://beachpets.com/long-beach-wa-shelter/dog-adoption-application/\n\nFor information on our adoption process, go to:\nhttp://beachpets.com/adopt/",

She will need a quiet home and would prefer carpet to smooth floors.  She is afraid of slipping and falling.  She will be doing underwater treadmill therapy before being evaluated to see if the right rear leg needs corrective surgery as well. If needed we will get it done for her.\nShe is smart and doing well in her foster home.\n\n\nTHIS  IS NOT A WORKING DOG AND WILL NOT BE PLACED AS ONE. IT WOULD BREAK THE DOG'S HEART.\n\n\nTHE APPLICATION PROCESS CAN BE FOUND ON OUR WEBSITE AT\nhttp://www.nepyresq.org/page/adoption-process-47.html.OUR DOGS ARE IN FOSTER HOMES ACROSS THE NORHTEAST. AFTER YOU ARE APPROVED YOU WILL BE GIVEN THE CONTACT INFORMATION FOR THE FOSTERS SO YOU CAN GO MEET THE DOG (S) .\n\nYOU CAN NOT TRAIN A PYRENEES TO STAY IN YOUR YARD WITHOUT A FENCE. IT IS IN THIER NATURE. IF YOU WANT A DOG TO WALK OFF LEASH WITH YOU THIS IS NOT THE BREED FOR YOU.\n\nThe adoption fee is $400 due to cost of medical needs of our dogs. $450 for Dogs 12 months and under. You will receive a copy of their medical records when you adopt.\n\nIf you have never had a Pyr Puppy you need to read this : http://www.nepyresq.org/page/i-want-a-great-pyrenees-puppy-50.html.\n\nWe DO NOT accept INVISIBLE fencing for the following reasons:\n1) Most Pyrs ignore the pain and go through it.\n2) This is a guardian breed and this fencing does not keep people or other animals out of your yard. The Pyr could take them as a threat or be attacked by them.\n\nMost of these dogs are not a dog park breed. They bark a lot and can bother your neighbors.",

I need to go to a home with teens and up as I am not too sure about the little people poking at me, I am a huge lover boy though. My previous owner said I am a pitbull mix (though I don't look like it). Guessing maybe pit/wire haired terrier x.  If you are interested in a new buddy to go on adventures with, maybe I am the one for you! To apply to adopt me please fill out an application at cbmrescue.org.",

Jackson is a 5 year old, 12 lb Yorkie mix who is a total sweetheart! Jackson gets along well with other dogs and new people he meets. He is very affectionate and low key. He walks well on leash and could stand to lose a pound our two to be at a healthy weight. Jackson would do fine in a home with or without another dog, and he would like a family that is home more often than not. He's really such a love!\n\nJackson's adoption fee is $350 and that includes his neuter, registered microchip, vaccines current, deworming and flea treatment.

            "description": "Daisy is a beautiful 3-year-old German shepherd. She was taken to an Alabama shelter as a stray & never reclaimed by her owner. \n\nDaisy is a very sweet & friendly girl! She plays well with other dogs & really loves being outdoors! Daisy loves attention & affection. She's a very smart girl & would be very easy to train. Daisy does need to eat out of a slow feeder because she eats her food very quickly. She needs a little bit of work taking treats gently as she gets very excited. We believe she'd do best in a home with children ages 8 & up due to this. \n\nDaisy hasn't always had the best life before coming to rescue. She obviously wasn't fed enough & is currently gaining some weight. Sadly, Daisy is heartworm positive, but she will be treated prior to adoption. \n\nDaisy is such a wonderful dog & will make an excellent family companion! \n\nCOMPLETED APPLICATIONS TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER INQUIRIES! IF you are interested in adopting, the FIRST step is to complete an application! Please email for an Application or copy and paste the following URL: \n\nhttps://fs26.formsite.com/nogreaterlove/form2/index.html \n\nUpon receipt of your application, the rescuer and foster in AL will contact you so you can ask any specific questions you may have! If there is more than one decision maker in the home, all of them should be in agreement! \n\n Adoption Donation: Unless otherwise stated in the pet's bio, our standard adoption fee is $395 which covers age appropriate vaccines (DHPP vax) and (Rabies vax if 12 weeks and older), utd on flea/tick prevention and heartworm prevention, worming, heartworm test @ age 6 months or older, microchip, fostering costs and health certificate.\n\nThank you for your understanding and consideration and for helping the dogs and puppies in need!\n\nWe do not adopt to anyone under the age of 21",

She found herself in the scary shelter without an owner in sight. Thankfully, she is now a Lovebug! Chelsea is a fun packed pooch who loves everyone she meets. She gets along well with other dogs, and can be quite playful.  She is also equally affectionate and loves her people. \n\nChelsea walks well on leash and enjoys greeting everyone along the way. She is very smart and food motivated making training a breeze. She has already mastered default sit! Chelsea would do great with a family who enjoys taking their dog on adventures with them. She would do best in a home with a yard, and with a family who is home a more often than not. She is going to make an amazing addition to a very lucky family! \n\nChelsea's adoption fee is $350 and that includes her spay, registered microchip, vaccines current, deworming and flea treatment.

Let's just say if you like a funny, happy, frisbee loving lab, then Bo is your fella!\nBo came into GDR weighing close to 130pds and we have been slowly whittling him down to a healthier weight so he can run and play and enjoy life like he really wants to. He has been great with all the dogs and humans and cats he meets, he is learning better leash manners which his previous person admitted she never taught him, and he is just an all around good ol' boy. \nBo is 8YO and in great health with the usual bumps that grow on big dogs as they age, but since they are fatty and cancer free, they don't need to be removed. Besides his weight and cute piggly wiggly ears, he's just perfect!!\nIf you enjoy the company of a  great older lab whose main goal is to enjoy life and bring a little comic relief into yours, then come meet Bo!\n\nWe kindly ask that you contact us thru Petfinder or Laura@GreatDawgRescue.org for each dawgs adoption status. We will then follow up with a phone interview and if applicable, send home an Adoption Application.  As always, a Home Visit with you and your family and a Vet Reference will be done prior to placing any of our dawgs to ensure the best match for each dawgs needs.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.All of the animals posted on our site have been temperament tested. While not all are in the immediate area, once we have processed and approved your application, we will move the dog to our adoptive area for you to meet, greet and hopefully adopt. Sometimes we will have more than one application on a dog. That does not mean it automatically goes to another family but you should be aware of the fact that until you are approved and set up for the meet/greet.. the dog could get adopted by another applicant.Sweet Skye was bred as a lab animal and only knew a cage as her whole world. That cage represented pain and fear. She was rescued after years of torture and went to live in a real home where she was loved and she has learned that people can be good and beds can be soft. She knows now what grass under her feet feels like and how wonderful it is to stretch her legs and run in her yard. Play is at long last something she has discovered. Life was finally going well for Skye. And then her family fell apart. Of course we have stepped in to help her find a new place where she will be loved and cared for. A place once again with a soft bed and a fenced yard where she can safely play. NO CRATES! She is terrified of crates, and for good reason! She has shown herself fine with other dogs, cats, and kids. Her foster says ' She needs someone to be attentive to her needs and take her out frequently so she can go to the bathroom like a good girl. She sleeps a lot but still has lots of energy for the kids. She does not bark or howl surprisingly. I have heard her bark only 3 times.' She needs a safe, loving place where her naturally sweet temperament will be valued. Is it possible that you will be her angel?\nNote from her foster: Being a beagle, Skye is going to need a yard with a physical fence where she can run and play safely.\nIf you are interested in Skye, please fill out an application at:\nhttps://reachoutrescue.rescuegroups.org/forms/form?formid=4588 Or contact:\nrorrcanine@gmail.com\n*** Click here to sponsor this dog! ***",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Please contact Jenny Cope (giveadogahome@live.com) for more information about this pet.\nBe sure to read ALL information provided.\n\nCAM was saved from a high kill shelter in Texas where dogs often have only 3 days to be saved. CAM is neutered, rabies, core vaccines, heartworm/tick disease tested negative for all. He is de-wormed, monthly preventatives and microchipped. At the time of rescue at the end of November 2020, he weighed around 50 pounds and has an estimated date of birth 9 May 2019. We cannot say for sure what breed he is, so we expect families to do their own research on his look and size and decide what breed you think he is and if you have the lifestyle suitable for his needs.\n\nMore pictures and possible video's can be found on his page on the rescue website.\n\nCAM has been at the rescue since November 2020 and unbelievably has had little interest from anyone. He is a sweet boy, a nice size, gets on good with other dogs here at the rescue, living in a communal area where he shares his food, water, several beds and hang out areas and has access to a large fenced in area where he will explore, or chase and play with the other dogs.\n\nWe do not know any history on why CAM ended up in the kill shelter, he has always been mild mannered whilst here, he is a good communicator and will let you know by his body language or a low growl if he is not happy with something - just normal ways that dogs communicate and all pet owners should ensure they are familiar and understand dogs body language on how they communicate.\n\nCAM would love an active family who goes on walks, hikes, runs, trips to the beach or lake where he can explore and live an all round happy, full, healthy life.\n\nWe are not able to say how he will be around cats or livestock.\n\nAll dogs use dog doors to go out and do their business or to enjoy the cool, fresh weather in their dog runs or communal areas. We cannot say if a dog is house-trained, however, we expect families to understand that all dogs need a transition period and accidents could happen and training is most definitely needed.\n\nAll dogs are fed Rachael Ray Nutrish PEAK Natural Dry Dog Food, Grain Free Western Grasslands Recipe with Bison. Rachael Ray Nutrish Peak Dog Food receives the Dog Food Advisor's second-highest tier rating of 4.5 stars.\n\nCAM is available for adoption for an adoption fee of $350\n\nThis fee is not negotiable and is used to cover the rescue costs of pulling, vetting, health certificate, transport from Texas to Maine, monthly preventatives, supplements, food, general day to day cost of running a brick and mortar rescue and anything else that is needed. Canadian adopters need to know that customs charge 15% taxes when entering into Canada.\n\nDue to borders being closed, it is up to families to call the US and Canadian borders to find the current details on border crossing. Animal Welfare is deemed essential in the US, but quarantine rules entering back into Canada must be followed.\n\nIf you feel that you have the heart and home to give this precious soul a wonderful life, please go to our website, under the ADOPTION INFO tab, complete, then submit the APPLICATION. Our process takes around 2-4 days, and ensuring your references are aware that we will be calling, could speed up the process. Once you have been approved, we discuss any questions in regards to the dog you are wanting to adopt, then you complete and submit the contract, make payment and then we can work out the pick up / transport arrangements.\n\nPlease do NOT submit an application if you are not looking to take home a new best friend within the next few weeks.\n\nhttps://www.giveadogahome-sanantonio.org/forms/form?formid=5838\n\nALL Dogs are LOCATED AT THE RESCUE IN SEBEC, MAINE. We post in various states along the east coast and Canada where we have had lots of successful adoptions to enable more exposure for these beautiful saved souls. Families will need to be prepared to travel to the rescue to meet and take home their new best friend. Sebec is located just outside the towns of Dover-Foxcroft and Milo (approx 8 miles) and approx 45 miles from Bangor. There are also lots of hotels, motels, pet friendly accommodations and wonderful camp-sites for the more adventurous families and what a great way to get to know your new best friend.\n\nClick here to watch a video of CAM - $350.",

            "description": "SIMBA ~2 years old. Good with dogs & Older Considerate Kids. Cats TBD. Needs companion animal\nGSRA adopts to residents of VA, NC, and SC only\nHave you ever heard the saying that dogs don't live in the past? Well, this sweet boy Simba is a prime example of one that has left his past behind him. You see, Simba was tied out on a tether and neglected to the point that he developed an embedded collar. Thankfully animal control was finally alerted and came to his rescue. He was able to receive the surgery he so desperately needed and now, after months of treatment, is all healed up. Because of this, he CANNOT have a collar or anything tight around his neck ever again. He also hates to be picked up but will easily jump in the car, etc. Even after what he went through, this boy has nothing but LOVE to give.\nSimba is a sweet little guy who loves life. He might be a little shy when he first meets you but if you give him a little time, he is a total lovebug. He loves going for walks, hikes in the woods, rides well in the car and LOVES playing with his toys. He loves attention and will rub up against you like a cat to get a little pet or two. He gets along great with my pup and did well on a cat test done at the shelter but we would retest just to be sure. Simba has free reign 24/7 along with my pup and I haven't had any issues. Simba has moderate energy and would best with a companion to play with. But he also knows how to settle down when he needs to.\nSimba would love a family who has a fenced yard and another dog that he can run and play with. He will need someone who is willing to work with him on training. He seems to pick up on things pretty well but will need some work. He is treat motivated so that is a huge plus. He does jump when excited and we are working on this. Because of this, it's best that he goes to a home w/o small children. This little boy wants nothing more than to be loved and be able to give his family all the love they can handle.\nIf you are looking for a sweet little fellow who has a bunch of love to give, then Simba might be the one for you.For more information on our adoptable pet list please visit: Adoptable Pet List\n\nPlease join us at our next Event(s):\n\nCurrent Scheduled Events:",

The application is online at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog If a dog is listed as available, then we are still taking applications - no need to email or call to ask about the status. Note: The forms that Petfinder or Adopt-a-pet has to inquire about the dog is not our application application. Our form must be filled out to be approved to adopt a pet.***\n\nCovid-19 Precautions:\n\nUntil further notice, Bichon & Little Buddies will be doing all meets and adoptions by appointment only. To be able to control the number of people at the shelter at one time, we will be suspending our open hours on Thursdays. If interested in adopting, please fill out the pre-adoption application and we will set up a time for you to come meet the dogs you are interested in.\n\nAbout this Dog:\n\nName: Grace\n\nBreed: Mixed - Possible Jack Russel/Shih Tzu\n\nApproximate Age: 2-3 yr\n\nGender: Female\n\nWeight:\n\nAdoption Fee: $400\n\nWhy in Rescue: Owner surrender\n\nGeneral Profile: Please fill out the adoption application at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog if you are interested in meeting one of our dogs.\n\nGrace was surrendered to another individual by her owner, who then transferred her to us so we could find her a great home. Because of this we don't have a background or history on her, and don't know how she is with other dogs or children. If she is scared or nervous she tends to be a little standoffish, so we are going to recommend a home without young children. When she is comfortable she is a happy, friendly girl that craves attention. If interested in adding Grace to your family, please fill out the preadoption application to start the adoption process. If her listing is online, we are still accepting application as we look for the best situation, not just the first application to come in.\n\nWe do our best to evaluate the dogs while they are with us, but they sometimes act different in the shelter environment than they do in a home. If you are interested in any of our dogs, please fill out the pre-adoption application and we will set up a time for you to come and meet them.\n\nIf considering adopting a former breeding dog, the following article is good to read to help you understand the special needs these dogs may have. http://www.nowisconsinpuppymills.com/mill-survivors.html\n\nAdoption Procedures:\n\n1. Completely fill out the pre-adoption application at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog. We will be checking with your vet if you have had pets, calling your landlord (if any) and checking a personal reference, before we contact you about visiting the adoptables. Any missing information may have us moving onto another application.\n\n2. If you application is approved, we will contact you to come meet the adoptables that you are interested in.\n\n3. If it is a match, you will complete the adoption contract and pay the adoption fee. Please be prepared to take your adopted pet home when you come meet him/her. In most cases, you will be able to take the pet home the same day. If all the vetting hasn't been done yet, we will hold the pet for you until the vet work is completed.\n\n4. If you have filled out an application and we haven't contacted you within a week, we may have missed your application, the pet may have been adopted by another applicant, or you may have been missing information on your application. You may contact us to find out the status of your application at this time. Please give us a week to process your application before contacting us!\n\nThe adoption fee through Bichon and Little Buddies Rescue is $200 - $475 depending on the age of the dog, which includes Wi State Sales Tax. Included in this fee is your new companion who will be spayed/neutered, have a current Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (as required by state law), current on age appropriate vaccinations, heartworm tested and started on preventative, microchipped, and dewormed. Other medical needs will also have been taken care of, such as dentals and treating ear infections.\n\nTo assist you and your new pet in adjusting to life together, you will also receive an 8 week age appropriate obedience training course at For Pet's Sake Dog Training for $50 (up to $200 value). You may opt to take Puppy Kindergarten, Adult Beginners, Small Dogs Big Hearts, or Shy & Reactive Dog Class. You must start the class within 90 days of adoption for the reduced fee. For more information on the classes visit www.forpetssake.cc\n\nAll dogs are seen BY APPOINTMENT ONLY. Many are in various foster homes getting extra one on one attention getting them ready for their new homes. The first step in adoption is filling out the pre-adoption application. Bichon and Little Buddies is run by volunteers who have full time jobs in addition to the hours they spend with the rescue dogs. Having an application on file assures us that the potential adopter is really interested in adopting a dog. It also assists us in placing dogs in homes where both the dog and new owners are happy. The application puts you under no obligation to adopt a dog from Bichon and Little Buddies.\n\nThe Dog Pre-Adoption Application can be found at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog\n\nThanks for thinking about adopting your new pet!More important information:\n\n***We are a Wisconsin based rescue and do not ship our pets. If you are considering adoption you must be willing to drive to meet and adopt the pet, as well as bring the pet back to us if the adoption doesn't work. We adopt primarily in WI and IL, but will consider applicants in MN, IA, and MI.***\n\n***Please do not set up an appointment to meet the animals until you are ready to take your pet home. If the meeting results in a match, you can often take the dog/cat home the same day or within a couple days if the medical care hasn't been completed. We are not able to hold pets for adopters beyond this time. Thanks for understanding.***\n\n***While we hope all of our adoptions lead to permanent homes for the animals we place, sometimes things just don't work out. We do have a 30 day trial period. For the first 30 days, if you or Bichon and Little Buddies decide that the adoption isn't a good match for either the humans or the pet, the adoption fee will be refunded minus $50 within 30 days of the return of the dog. Bichon and Little Buddies also requires adopters to return the pet to us at any time that they are unable or unwilling to care for the animal anymore.***\n\n***We do not show dogs/cats without an appointment. The first step in adoption is filling out the pre-adoption application at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog Please do not call/email until AFTER you have filled out an application.***\n\nBichon and Little Buddies is a State Licensed Rescue # 268555-DS",

Please give us a week to process your application before contacting us!\n\nThe adoption fee through Bichon and Little Buddies Rescue is $200 - $475 depending on the age of the dog, which includes Wi State Sales Tax. Included in this fee is your new companion who will be spayed/neutered, have a current Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (as required by state law), current on age appropriate vaccinations, heartworm tested and started on preventative, microchipped, and dewormed. Other medical needs will also have been taken care of, such as dentals and treating ear infections.\n\nTo assist you and your new pet in adjusting to life together, you will also receive an 8 week age appropriate obedience training course at For Pet's Sake Dog Training for $50 (up to $200 value). You may opt to take Puppy Kindergarten, Adult Beginners, Small Dogs Big Hearts, or Shy & Reactive Dog Class. You must start the class within 90 days of adoption for the reduced fee. For more information on the classes visit www.forpetssake.cc\n\nAll dogs are seen BY APPOINTMENT ONLY. Many are in various foster homes getting extra one on one attention getting them ready for their new homes. The first step in adoption is filling out the pre-adoption application. Bichon and Little Buddies is run by volunteers who have full time jobs in addition to the hours they spend with the rescue dogs. Having an application on file assures us that the potential adopter is really interested in adopting a dog. It also assists us in placing dogs in homes where both the dog and new owners are happy. The application puts you under no obligation to adopt a dog from Bichon and Little Buddies.\n\nThe Dog Pre-Adoption Application can be found at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog\n\nThanks for thinking about adopting your new pet!More important information:\n\n***We are a Wisconsin based rescue and do not ship our pets. If you are considering adoption you must be willing to drive to meet and adopt the pet, as well as bring the pet back to us if the adoption doesn't work. We adopt primarily in WI and IL, but will consider applicants in MN, IA, and MI.***\n\n***Please do not set up an appointment to meet the animals until you are ready to take your pet home. If the meeting results in a match, you can often take the dog/cat home the same day or within a couple days if the medical care hasn't been completed. We are not able to hold pets for adopters beyond this time. Thanks for understanding.***\n\n***While we hope all of our adoptions lead to permanent homes for the animals we place, sometimes things just don't work out. We do have a 30 day trial period. For the first 30 days, if you or Bichon and Little Buddies decide that the adoption isn't a good match for either the humans or the pet, the adoption fee will be refunded minus $50 within 30 days of the return of the dog. Bichon and Little Buddies also requires adopters to return the pet to us at any time that they are unable or unwilling to care for the animal anymore.***\n\n***We do not show dogs/cats without an appointment. The first step in adoption is filling out the pre-adoption application at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog Please do not call/email until AFTER you have filled out an application.***\n\nBichon and Little Buddies is a State Licensed Rescue # 268555-DS",

Bruno is a 1-year-old Husky who was rescued from Ecuador when he was a puppy where he was treated very poorly. A nice family was able to save him and bring him here, but due to unexpected circumstances, they had to surrender him. Bruno is great with older kids, most larger dogs, and other people but is very shy and scared at first due to all he had to go through as a puppy. He would need a family who has husky experience, a lot of patience and a lot of love to give! He would not be a fit for a home with cats or small dogs.\n\n\nIf you are interested in Bruno please fill out an application on our website, www.apathwaytohope.org",

He has done well with other dogs, and loves to be with people! Charlie enjoys play time, treats, hikes in the woods, and more treats! He is smart and ready to learn with his new people. Charlie is skinny at 55lbs, and will likely be about 65lbs at a good weight. We think Charlie would do best in an adult only home, and no cats! \n\nCharlie has begun to show some jumpy/mouthy behaviors. He is looking for an owner who had experience with training dogs to help him work through this. Charlie is smart, and eager to please, but will need consistency to work through this behavior. He would not do well in an apartment or with city living. Charlie needs a home with a fenced in yard, as he is still getting used to walking on a leash. If you are looking for an active buddy to join your family, please email adopt@baypathhumane.org today!",

I'm pretty easy to please. We can spend our days exploring outdoors or we can snuggle up and watch a movie. Both sound like great ways to spend our days to me! Maybe you have other things that you enjoy? I\u2019d love to hear about them and hopefully do them with you. Life is much more enjoyable with a friend! \n\nA few basic details about me. I\u2019m around 5 years old and 71 lbs. \n\nIf I sound like the pup you\u2019ve been searching for, contact Mary\u2019s Dogs and ask for Ophelia! I can\u2019t wait to meet you!  \n\nWould you like more information on this adorable pup? Email us at:  marysdogsadoptions@gmail.com or submit an online questionnaire at: https://www.marysdogs.com/adoption-questionnaire which OFFICIALLY gets you on the path to bringing home your new furry family member!\t\n",

I love going on car rides and sticking my head out the window to see the world. I also like to lounge around all day on my bed until it's time to go potty outside which I'm really good at. I guess I could go for long walks sometimes, but I'd like my human to stay inside with me most days to give me treats! I've made friends with other dogs before, yet I do enjoy being king of the house. All I'm asking for is a real chance to show someone what a softy and protector I am. If you know how hard it can be to open up to someone new then I think we will get along great. And another thing I know I got a puppy face but I'm a mature dawg and I want an adult human(s) who can match my vibe, is that you?",

Scrooge will make an excellent companion for someone, but needs a home with no small children as he can be easily frightened. Scrooge has been neutered, vaccinated and microchipped.

They are being fostered with other dogs of all sizes and ages as well as respectful children and are young enough to be introduced to cats. They are learning about inside living and are doing great! working on house training and playing with toys...these grateful pups would love to be adopted together if possible and if not, they will be looking for a forever home where they will have another sweet sibling that will be a friend to them. If you would like to meet Breezy and Booker, please apply at yvpr.org/adoption.\n\n\nAn application must be filled out and accepted before a meet can be set up. If accepted, you will hear from us within 72 hours. You will have the opportunity to ask questions before you meet the pet; an adoption may or may not happen at that time. We do adopt outside the Yakima area IF you are able to come to Yakima to pick up your adopted pet.  We do not have a kennel facility; all of our pets are in foster homes. Therefore, meets and adoptions take place at either our office or at a place chosen by the foster.   If a pet has 'pending' beside its name, an adoption is imminent. Please fill out an application anyway because adoptions don't always go through. Your application will be kept on file for 30 days in case you find another pet you'd like to apply for.  Thanks for thinking adoption and Good Luck!",

While we don't know much about his past, we can tell you that Huckleberry is friendly and gentle. He loves to explore, but is just as content laying in your arms. Huckleberry has been working on basic training and is progressing with housebreaking. He needs to learn some manners when it comes to jumping. He has been well-socialized with other dogs and would love a home with a canine companion. As with any dog, he would benefit from a structured daily routine and continued training once he settles into his new home.\n\nIn order to be considered as a potential adopter, we will need you to complete our online application at www.arrus.org. Should we choose to move forward with your family, you will be notified via email within the week. Due to the large volume of applications received, we are no longer able to respond to each and every applicant. We apologize in advance for the inconvenience and appreciate your understanding. \n\nAdditional information and/or medical records for this rescue pet are available and will be reviewed in person should we choose to move forward in scheduling a meet n\u2019 greet. In the meantime, please feel free to follow us on follow us on Instagram (animal_rescue_r_us) and visit our Facebook page at www.facebook.com/arrusadopt for more pictures and posts from his/her foster family. \n\nHELP US, HELP THEM!

            "description": "Tucker was adopted a a young pupper but for some reason the tiny toddler in the home if afraid of him.  It is totally not his fault, but to keep peace in the house the family feels it is best to find Tucker a different forever home.  This is what they say about this boy ,  \" Tucker is a playful fun loving dog that just wants his belly to be scratched from sun up to sun down. He is a dog that needs lots of love and affection. He is always seeking your approval and wants to hear what a good boy he is. He is crate trained. He sleeps and eats in his crate, but also uses this as his favorite place to nap or use as a place to hide when he is scared. He is happiest when his crate is covered, but is okay without a cover on it. He loves his crate so much! He is potty trained and almost never has accidents in the house. The only time is once or twice when  he was very excited and it was a tiny amount. He loves children and is very gentle. The only risk with kids around, is they might get kisses on their face or hands!  He sleeps all night in his covered crate from usually 9:30-7:30, but will cry out if he needs to potty. This is a rare occasion though. He walks on a leash, but it takes him a bit to warm up to the idea. He has lived with another dog while living with us. They are best friends. They cuddle in their crates, play, and eat together, so he would probably like a playmate in his new home. He barks at squirrels and June bugs, but not at passing neighbors. We have had a few visitor dogs too, and he seems to love anyone he meets. (Animal or human) He has not been around and cats so I\u2019m unsure of how that would go. He is a wonderful boy\"      He is about 50 pounds at 8 months.  Might fill out a little but shouldn't be a huge boy when grown.  \n\nPlease email adoptions@petsandpeople.com directly for a faster response and we will send you our questionnaire. We get many each day so please watch your spam/trash folders for our replies.\n\nAdoption fee for all dogs and puppies is $130.00 each, which includes spay/neuter, vaccinations (including all puppy boosters for puppies under 4 months), worming, flea/tick treatment if needed, microchip and collar/leash/tags.",

They are being fostered with other dogs of all sizes and ages as well as respectful children and are young enough to be introduced to cats. They are learning about inside living and are doing great! working on house training and playing with toys...these grateful pups would love to be adopted together if possible and if not, they will be looking for a forever home where they will have another sweet sibling that will be a friend to them. If you would like to meet Breezy and Booker, please apply at yvpr.org/adoption.\n\n\nAn application must be filled out and accepted before a meet can be set up. If accepted, you will hear from us within 72 hours. You will have the opportunity to ask questions before you meet the pet; an adoption may or may not happen at that time. We do adopt outside the Yakima area IF you are able to come to Yakima to pick up your adopted pet.  We do not have a kennel facility; all of our pets are in foster homes. Therefore, meets and adoptions take place at either our office or at a place chosen by the foster.   If a pet has 'pending' beside its name, an adoption is imminent. Please fill out an application anyway because adoptions don't always go through. Your application will be kept on file for 30 days in case you find another pet you'd like to apply for.  Thanks for thinking adoption and Good Luck!",

He came to our rescue after his owner left him abandoned at a local shelter when they could no longer care for him.  This boy deserves to find a family that will give him the love and care he deserves.   He is crate and house trained loves to run and play in the yard.  He would excel in any training classes and would make a wonderful companion.  He knows basic commands like sit and give paw. He needs a family where someone is home more often than not or avid walker/runner.  He is 60lbs and would do best with children 10 years or older due to his larger size.   He would love a fenced in yard but would do well in an apartment or condo with an active owner.   Zeke is current on vaccines, neutered and microchipped.  This very charming boy is ready and waiting for his forever family.   Contact us today at adopt@carolinapaws.com to meet Zeke.  \n\nAdoption fee includes current vaccines, microchip and spay/neuter.  Please review our adoption requirements on our website https://www.carolinapaws.com/adopt/adoption-process/ If interested in one of our rescued cats/dogs complete the online application.  Submitting an application does not obligate you to adopt nor guarantee an adoption.  It is in everyone's best interest to ensure the best possible match, and your cooperation is appreciated. \n\nWe are only accepting applications from the greater Charlotte North Carolina area and certain surrounding counties.",

He is a little shy, but is a friendly boy. He had a mass upon arrival he had removed. We are open by appointment only to ensure we can properly social distance here at the shelter. We cannot guarantee a specific pet or type of pet will be available at your appointment. We do not hold pets. We operate on a first come first serve basis and while you can put what/who you are interested in in the appointment sign up, all appointments are general dog/cat/other animal appointments since we cannot guarantee what will be available at the time of your appointment. If you would like to set up a non-specific dog or cat appointment we have our scheduling system online now at: https://guilfordcountync.gov/our-county/animal-services/animal-shelter/animal-adoption-scheduling All adopted cats and dogs at Guilford County Animal Services come fully up to date on age appropriate vaccines, spayed/neutered, and microchipped. If you are interested in meeting any of our pets, please visit our website to schedule an appointment online. If you believe this may be your pet, please come to the shelter during business hours and bring your ID, proof of ownership, and proof of spay/neuter and/or rabies vaccination history if you have it. See our reclaiming your pet page for more information. If you have any further questions, please contact us at 336-641-3400 or visit our website at https://guilfordcountync.gov/our-county/animal-services/animal-shelter.

She has all the attributes of a classic lab\u2026smart, gentle, curious, well mannered with a strong desire to love and be loved.  \nMona would LOVE to have a home where a family could spend one on one time with her, spoil her with long walks, long snuggling sessions, and allow her to relax and just be with her. We know that Mona came from a home where multiple dogs, some of them siblings, bullied each other for attention and affection, and it is obvious she was on the receiving side of some of that bullying. So for that reason, the absolute best and only home  for her is one where she will be the only dog, spoiled rotten with all the time and attention she deserves, and finally have the chance of being someones  one and only girl.\nIf you are ready to have that one special canine love in your heart and home, this sweet girl is very deserving of taking that spot.\n\n\nWe kindly ask that you contact us thru Petfinder or Laura@GreatDawgRescue.org for each dawgs adoption status. We will then follow up with a phone interview and if applicable, send home an Adoption Application.  As always, a Home Visit with you and your family and a Vet Reference will be done prior to placing any of our dawgs to ensure the best match for each dawgs needs. Much thanks!!\nhttps://GreatDawgRescue.org",

I need to meet all family members and any dogs in the home to make sure it's a perfect match. Spot will be shown by appointment only.

Have no fear! Black Betty (BB) is HERE! My five-year-old daughter and Black Betty get along swimmingly. My daughter carries her around, and BB loves the attention. She is extremely playful, cute as a button, and wanting a furrrever home. She cuddles; she has the cutest run/hop ever. She's very friendly to our dogs (30 lb Puggle and 100 lb Bullmastiff).\n She is a puppy & will need typical puppy training to help her learn. We are working on: barking, being mouthy, not jumping up, crate & potty training. She loves affection & treats so training should be a breeze!\n\nInterested in this sweet pup? Apply today at http://www.underdogpetrescue.org/dog-application\n\n**Please note: Our animals live in foster homes throughout the Madison area. We do not have a shelter where animals are available for daily viewing. Applying is the first step in our process.**\n\nDogs from Underdog Pet Rescue come with the following medical care already provided:\nSpay/Neuter\nRabies, Distemper, and Bordetella Vaccinations (as age appropriate-puppy adopters may need to cover some vaccine boosters)\nHeartworm Test (for dogs over 6mo)\nMicrochip\nDeworming\nHeartworm and Flea/Tick Preventative\nAny other necessary medical treatment as recommended by veterinarian\n\nOur adult dog adoption fee is $300. Our puppy (under 5 mo) is $375. Our senior dog (over 8 yrs) is $250.\n\n*Please note that all breeds noted are estimates or best guesses. We very rarely have information on our animals' actual breeds since they often come to the shelters we work with as strays*",

I would love to go to puppy classes with you, it will be so much fun and I will be the star of the class! I am good with kids, dogs, and cats. I have your average puppy personality: silly, goofy, sweet, loving and AWESOME.  Want to adopt me?  \nInterested in becoming a forever home for mary? Fill out our online adoption application: http://www.friendswithfourpaws.org/adoption-form.html This is the first step in our process, and we don't go any further without an application.\n\nFind more adoptable pets, news and information on Instagram @friendswithfourpaws or our Facebook page Friends with Four Paws .\n\nWe put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them and you.  Please do not submit an application if you are not serious about adopting mary.\nWe are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and mary the perfect forever home, and appreciate you working with us.  \n\nOur adoption fee is $525. This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.\n\nAll of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements for transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home AFTER an application is being processed.\n\nThank you in advance for your patience with our process and for making adoption YOUR option!",

I would love to go to puppy classes with you, it will be so much fun and I will be the star of the class! I am good with kids, dogs, and cats. I have your average puppy personality: silly, goofy, sweet, loving and AWESOME.  Want to adopt me?  \nInterested in becoming a forever home for Peter? Fill out our online adoption application: http://www.friendswithfourpaws.org/adoption-form.html This is the first step in our process, and we don't go any further without an application.\n\nFind more adoptable pets, news and information on Instagram @friendswithfourpaws or our Facebook page Friends with Four Paws .\n\nWe put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them and you.  Please do not submit an application if you are not serious about adopting Peter.\nWe are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and Peter the perfect forever home, and appreciate you working with us.  \n\nOur adoption fee is $525. This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.\n\nAll of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements for transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home AFTER an application is being processed.\n\nThank you in advance for your patience with our process and for making adoption YOUR option!",

Adoption Donation $200 if picked up in TN, $250 plus transport fee for out of state adoptions.\n\nAdd some sweetness to your life with this chocolate boy, Kodi! He is a 1-year-old, 41 pound Lab mix (best guess) with a fluffy coat and a funny little underbite. Kodi is very loving and friendly, and he gets along well with other dogs and cats. He walks nicely on a leash and is crate trained, and well on his way to being housetrained. Kodi is learning how to cuddle in bed and play with toys as he had never experienced that fun before. His favorite toy right now is a tennis ball, and he has even learned to throw it for himself. He is highly food motivated and will be easy to train with treats. He loves to be close to his people, and his foster mom describes him as a velcro dog. Kodi is eager to please and would be a great hiking running or outdoor activity partner. If you think he sounds like the One, please apply today!\n\nInterested in adopting? Take the first step and complete an adoption application on our website: http://aarf-tn.com/adopt/adoption-apps/\n\nIf you have questions that are not covered in the profile, visit the Pet Inquiry Form: http://aarf-tn.com/contact/pet-inquiry-form/.\n\nTHIS PET IS FOSTERED IN TENNESSEE! We do list and adopt our pets nationwide. Typical transport cost to the Northeast is $160. Due to interstate adoption regulations, we are not able to adopt to RI and MA state residents.\n\nA.A.R.F. (All About Rescue and Fixin' Inc.) http://aarf-tn.com/ is a non-profit, 501(c)(3) no kill animal rescue organization located in the Upper Cumberland area of Tennessee. A.A.R.F. is comprised of unpaid volunteers and survives only on public donations. Thank you for thinking adoption first!\n\nPrior to adoption, all canines and felines are spayed or neutered, have received their age appropriate vaccinations, have been de-wormed for common parasites, and have received treatment for prevention of fleas and ticks. All canines over the age of 6 months have been tested for heartworm. All canines are put on heartworm prevention as soon as possible - this means dogs as soon as they are tested negative. Puppies are put on prevention immediately. All felines, regardless of age, have been tested for Feline Leukemia/FIV. Each animal receives a health check by a licensed veterinarian prior to adoption. Anything else found will be treated by our organization prior to adoption.",

I would love to go to puppy classes with you, it will be so much fun and I will be the star of the class! I am good with kids, dogs, and cats. I have your average puppy personality: silly, goofy, sweet, loving and AWESOME.  Want to adopt me?  \nInterested in becoming a forever home for Paul? Fill out our online adoption application: http://www.friendswithfourpaws.org/adoption-form.html This is the first step in our process, and we don't go any further without an application.\n\nFind more adoptable pets, news and information on Instagram @friendswithfourpaws or our Facebook page Friends with Four Paws .\n\nWe put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them and you.  Please do not submit an application if you are not serious about adopting Paul.\nWe are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and Paul the perfect forever home, and appreciate you working with us.  \n\nOur adoption fee is $525. This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.\n\nAll of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements for transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home AFTER an application is being processed.\n\nThank you in advance for your patience with our process and for making adoption YOUR option!",

Mikka would like to be the only pet in her new home as she isn't a fan of cats and she is selective on her dog friends. Mikka LOVES to go for walks and is eager to show her new family around town! This gentle girl can be a bit chatty and isn't well suited for apartment living. She would much prefer to have her own backyard space where she can play between walks!\n\nMikka has been around children without issue though she has never lived with kids before. Mikka can be left alone for a few hours at a time though she certainly prefers to be around her people. Mikka doesn't show any signs of separation anxiety or resource guarding in shelter or in her previous home. \n\nMikka LOVES people, and is eager to say hi to everyone she meets! She will come up to you wiggling her bum with a big tail wag to greet you! If you're looking for a best friend, Mikka is your girl!\n\nWe are still getting to know Mikka and will update with new information as we better understand her needs!\n\nThank you for your interest in adopting from us! Due to the high number of applications we receive for our animals, we will only be contacting potential adopters to further review their application.\n\nPlease note, due to the current COVID-19 pandemic our adoption process has changed. Please visit our website https://spca.bc.ca/adoption/how-to-adopt/ for more information and to apply for the animal you are interested in. All adoptions are by appointment only once we have received and approved an application. Primary Color: Orange Roan Secondary Color: White Weight: 35.9kg Age: 7yrs 0mths 0wks Animal has been Spayed",

Violet and Vanya are brindle colored and Violet has a darker brindle and weighs 9.6 lbs.  These pups will be 8+ weeks old and ready for her forever home next weekend 2/6/21\nViolet loves her foster family and is with other dogs and a cats, she is with older, respectful children and is quiet and sweet, loves to play and loves her cuddles. If you are looking for a sweet pup to add to your family, please apply at yvpr.org/adoptions  \n\n\nAn application must be filled out and accepted before a meet can be set up. If accepted, you will hear from us within 72 hours. You will have the opportunity to ask questions before you meet the pet; an adoption may or may not happen at that time. We do adopt outside the Yakima area IF you are able to come to Yakima to pick up your adopted pet.  We do not have a kennel facility; all of our pets are in foster homes. Therefore, meets and adoptions take place at either our office or at a place chosen by the foster.   If a pet has 'pending' beside its name, an adoption is imminent. Please fill out an application anyway because adoptions don't always go through. Your application will be kept on file for 30 days in case you find another pet you'd like to apply for.  Thanks for thinking adoption and Good Luck!",

            "description": "Hi, my name is Posie and I'm sweet and smart and so glad I'm out of  that crowded shelter. I'm still young, estimated DOB 11/9/20) and probably have some heeler in my ancestry. I'm learning so much now that I'm out of that shelter and in a home with other dogs and some considerate children who visit and I love the whole family. I probably would do well with kitties that will tolerate an active puppy.  I'm doing well on my house training and am crate trained.  I'm just a puppy and can get into a lot of trouble so you'll need to be willing to give me lots of gentle guidance, so I can learn all those big dog things, like how to behave in a house, how to walk on a leash without pulling, and all those verbal commands every dog should know. I may even treat people like I treat my sibling with rough play or decide that new pair of shoes or a table leg would make a great chew toy, so a lot of appropriate toys should be in my future. The good news is that with the right training and LOTS of love, I'll be the best addition to your family ever and your best bud. If you are interested in me, please send an email to scpdogworld@gmail.com to get more information on how to fill out an application and have a great meet and greet to see if we are a match made in heaven.\n\nAdopter for this dog must reside in the immediate Houston/Galveston area and be at least 25 years old.  A home visit may be required prior to this dog going to any home. The adoption fee for a dog is $190 (or $245 for puppies) which includes State of Texas sales tax. All dogs are microchipped, on heartworm protection, spayed/neutered, vaccinated, de-wormed and treated for fleas.",

Meet Sarg, a one and a half year old Husky/Shepherd mix who is ready for an active family to go with is lively personality!! This guy will definitely put some pet in your step when going on walks and will need some help with his leash training but he is a very smart guy and with direction catches on pretty fast. Sarg likes to go on car rides as long as he is allowed to hang his cute face out the window for the breeze to flow through his fur. This guy likes to be the boss in his home when it comes to other dogs so he will need to find a submissive female to be his buddy. We always will have you bring in your dog prior to adoption to make sure the match is a good fit for both dogs. When it comes to cats Sarg is not a fan so he requires a feline free family!! If you think your family is ready to meet this guy, apply for Sarg today!!",

She adores attention and is good with dogs, kids and friendly cats. When Kelsi came to our rescue she had not been taken care of. Her coat was a mess and upon cleaning her up we discovered several fatty tumors. They have been removed and examined and she has a clean bill of health. She is already spayed, microchipped and is heartworm negative. Kelsi is a grateful dog, she lives for attention and pets. Kelsi is completely house trained and has excellent manners in the home. She is very athletic and can scale a 4 foot chain link fence, so we will require a wooden fence for containment. She will be adopted quickly so get your application in now.",

            "description": "Toast is part of a litter dubbed the \"Breakfast\" pups. This 10 week old, bully mix came into the rescue with his five littermates from rural Alabama. While we don't know much about his past, we can tell you that this regal boy is friendly, playful, and affectionate. He is super social and loves to play, although, he is just as content being snuggled up in your arms. Toast has been doing well with basic training and sleeps through the night. He has been well-socialized with other dogs and would likely do well in a home with children. As with any dog, Toast would benefit from a structured daily routine and continued training once he settles into his new home.\n\nIn order to be considered as a potential adopter, we will need you to complete our online application at www.arrus.org.

Frito is a 2-year-old, Pittie mix that is a total hunk! Though he may have a tough-looking mug, he is super social and friendly. He greets everyone he meets with joy and excitement and is instantly asking for belly-rubs and affection! Frito assessed well with other pups and did well with multiple personalities in his playgroup. Sometimes he can be shy around new dogs, but gains confidence with a proper introduction. Frito loves nothing more than his chew toys and bones and will keep himself occupied for hours - making for a great work from home Buddy. He is working hard to master his basics - his foster has already taught him \u201cSit,\" \"Stay,\" and \"Crate\u201d and is on his way to learning more! Frito will do best in a home with experienced dog-owners who love the aspect of training and structure for a young dog who is eager to please, food motivated, and oh so sweet. If you\u2019re looking for an affectionate, playful pup to join your family, Frito may be the guy for you!\n",

            "description": "Hi, my name is Merrick. I am 6lbs(will be bigger fully grown), 2 months old, schnauzer/shih tzu/beagl mix with maybe some super mutt thrown in for extra spice!  I am very smart and love to make you happy. I would love to go to puppy classes with you, it will be so much fun and I will be the star of the class! I am good with kids, dogs, and cats. I have your average puppy personality: silly, goofy, sweet, loving and AWESOME.  Want to adopt me?  \nInterested in becoming a forever home for Merrick? Fill out our online adoption application: http://www.friendswithfourpaws.org/adoption-form.html This is the first step in our process, and we don't go any further without an application.\n\nFind more adoptable pets, news and information on Instagram @friendswithfourpaws or our Facebook page Friends with Four Paws .\n\nWe put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them and you.  Please do not submit an application if you are not serious about adopting Merrick.\nWe are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and Merrick the perfect forever home, and appreciate you working with us.  \n\nOur adoption fee is $525. This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.\n\nAll of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements for transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home AFTER an application is being processed.\n\nThank you in advance for your patience with our process and for making adoption YOUR option!",

            "description": "Kingston is a handsome 7-year old male Pit Bull Terrier who arrived at the HSOV on September 21, 2020 after he was picked up in the Cutler Ohio area by the Washington County Dog Warden (and was surrendered by his owner).\n\nKingston has a brown short smooth coat with a large patch of white on his chest, a long tail, and an adorable face with a splash of white on his muzzle/white stripe on his forehead, a liver-colored nose, and short cropped ears. Kingston was quite friendly when HSOV Kennel tech Kim Cowman accompanied him outdoors for his original photo session on September 22, 2020 :)\n\nThe information on Kingston's intake form indicates that he is not good other animals. He apparently was kept indoors since it is noted that Kingston is housebroken.\n\nKingston weighs 55 lbs and walks fairly well on a leash.\n\nKingston was neutered on September 30, 2020 and was also given rabies vaccine. Kingston was adopted later that afternoon.\n\nUPDATE: We were saddened when Kingston was returned to our shelter on January 7, 2021. His adopter stated that Kingston did not get along with her other dog.\n\nKingston appears to have some arthritis (or neurological issues) in his hind legs and hips and also has a slight head tilt these days :( We are listing him as a 'Special Needs Dog' for that reason but we prefer to think of him as merely very special. Kingston still loves to walk with our kennel techs and volunteers and puts forth a noble effort whenever anyone offers him the opportunity for some one-on-one time and attention :)\n\nSo this sweet boy is looking for a fabulous home with a compassionate individual or family who will love and cherish him forever and ever.  Kingston has a gentle, lovable personality and is the kind of dog that you want to hold close and promise (as you whisper in his ear) that he will find the best home ever.\n\nThese informal photos were taken in the shelter lobby on a rainy afternoon (January 25, 2021) when kennel tech Brad Loyland treated Kingston to some out-of-kennel time shortly before the the shelter staff left for the day.  Kingston enjoyed being the 'center of attention' and being lavished with 'good boy' praises as he carefully made his rounds to each of our kennel techs.  Kingston was so caught up in the moment that he actually came nose-to-nose with Tinker who is one of our free-roaming shelter kitties (and he doesn't even like felines)!\n\n\n",

He is a wonderfully sweet boy, although he is very shy upon introduction. It took a few days, but he has slowly warmed up to his humans and foster sisters. If you are patient with him he will reward you with his sweet personality.\n\nScout is a medium energy dog who is equally happy trotting around the yard as he is taking a snooze. So far his favorite activity is curling up on a comfy dog bed while the family watches TV or works from home. He gets along great with his foster sisters and is happy to let them take the lead as he learns the ropes. His gentle and calm disposition would make him a great companion for anyone with a quiet home to offer. He has a ton of love to give in return.\n\nScout's Webpage - http://beaglemaryland.org/brsm_ms/vIndividualCurrentDog.aspx?dogid=69898\nAdoptable Dog Webpage - http://beaglemaryland.org/brsm_ms/vCurrentDogs.aspx\n\nIf you'd like to adopt one of our beagles:\n*Go to our Website - href=\"http://beaglemaryland.org\n*Review our  Standards for Adoption - http://beaglemaryland.org/Home.aspx?pg=standardsforadoption.htm\n*Fill out an Adopter Profile - \nhttp://brsmbeagles.org/new_site/documents/BRSM_profile_secure.pdf\n and email it to us (or print it off, fill it in and send it via regular mail, if you prefer)\n*A BRSM volunteer will contact you to guide you through the rest of the process!\n\nWe hope to hear from you, and so do the beagles!",

While we don't know much about her past, we can tell you that this sassy girl is friendly, playful, and affectionate. She loves to romp around the house and play with her toys, although, she is just as content being snuggled up in your arms. Donut has been doing well with basic training and sleeps through the night. She has been well-socialized with other dogs and would likely do well in a home with children. As with any dog, Donut would benefit from a structured daily routine and continued training once she settles into her new home.\n\nIn order to be considered as a potential adopter, we will need you to complete our online application at www.arrus.org. Should we choose to move forward with your family, you will be notified via email within the week. Due to the large volume of applications received, we are no longer able to respond to each and every applicant. We apologize in advance for the inconvenience and appreciate your understanding. \n\nAdditional information and/or medical records for this rescue pet are available and will be reviewed in person should we choose to move forward in scheduling a meet n\u2019 greet. In the meantime, please feel free to follow us on follow us on Instagram (animal_rescue_r_us) and visit our Facebook page at www.facebook.com/arrusadopt for more pictures and posts from his/her foster family. \n\nHELP US, HELP THEM! Animal Rescue R Us is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. We do not receive county, state or federal funding and rely solely on donations. These donations help offset the cost of routine veterinary care, medical expenses, and other necessities while the rescue animal is in our  care.

Valerie and Vivian are tan colored and Valerie has a darker ring around her neck and weighs 8.10 lbs.  These pups will be 8+ weeks old and ready for her forever home next weekend 2/6/21\nValerie loves her foster family and is with other dogs and a cats, she is with older, respectful children and is quiet and sweet, loves to play and loves her cuddles. If you are looking for a sweet pup to add to your family, please apply at yvpr.org/adoptions \n\n\nAn application must be filled out and accepted before a meet can be set up. If accepted, you will hear from us within 72 hours. You will have the opportunity to ask questions before you meet the pet; an adoption may or may not happen at that time. We do adopt outside the Yakima area IF you are able to come to Yakima to pick up your adopted pet.  We do not have a kennel facility; all of our pets are in foster homes. Therefore, meets and adoptions take place at either our office or at a place chosen by the foster.   If a pet has 'pending' beside its name, an adoption is imminent. Please fill out an application anyway because adoptions don't always go through. Your application will be kept on file for 30 days in case you find another pet you'd like to apply for.  Thanks for thinking adoption and Good Luck!",

I am very smart and love to make you happy. I would love to go to puppy classes with you, it will be so much fun and I will be the star of the class! I am good with kids, dogs, and cats. I have your average puppy personality: silly, goofy, sweet, loving and AWESOME.  Want to adopt me?  \nInterested in becoming a forever home for Sienna? Fill out our online adoption application: http://www.friendswithfourpaws.org/adoption-form.html This is the first step in our process, and we don't go any further without an application.\n\nFind more adoptable pets, news and information on Instagram @friendswithfourpaws or our Facebook page Friends with Four Paws .\n\nWe put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them and you.  Please do not submit an application if you are not serious about adopting Sienna.\nWe are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and Sienna the perfect forever home, and appreciate you working with us.  \n\nOur adoption fee is $525. This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.\n\nAll of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements for transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home AFTER an application is being processed.\n\nThank you in advance for your patience with our process and for making adoption YOUR option!",

They were likely outdoor dogs before coming to LHAR. They are working on their house training and leash skills. Will require secure and tall fencing or leash walks only. We would love to see them be homed together, but could be seperated. \n  \nThey are being fostered together in a private home \n\nWeight: approx 50 lbs bs as of January 31st        \n \nPhotos were taken on January 31st    \n\nQuestions?

Millie was relinquished to a shelter in rural North Carolina due to the family having financial issues and unable to continue caring for this sweet soul.  Millie was severely matted, scared and it was found that she has a chain of mammary masses.  She just underwent surgery and we'll know more in a few days about the status of the biopsy.  With all of the hurdles, Millie is precious and we are looking for that special family who can care for her while she's healing and has the financial ability to keep her groomed regularly.  Millie is said to be good with other dogs but she has not been child or cat tested yet.  We are awaiting transport to us at this time but accepting applications for foster/adopt.

            "description": "Kankel is a 5 month old, 23 pound Pittie puppy who is the life of the party! This girl is constantly on the go, ready to make new friends. She loves nothing more than running and playing with the other dogs in her foster home. Her favorite thing is being chased around the yard while her little legs carry her as quick as they can! Kankel isn't picky about her toys and will play with anything she's given! She's working hard on crate and potty training but will need continued work in her forever home. Kankel loves to give out kisses and is working on her manners. Due to her energy level, Kankel would do best in a home without toddlers, as she may accidentally knock over a small kid in her excitement. While she has not been exposed to cats, she would likely do well with a dog-savvy cat! This girl is a bundle of energy who is ready to find that perfect forever home that will teach her tricks and help burn off her energy. If you want to make Kankel a part of your family, apply online today!\n\nMy adoption fee is $400.",

He is good with children but hasn't been dog or cat tested yet.\n\nIf you would like more information on Joe or would like to schedule a meet and greet, please call Isle of Wight County Animal Services at (757)365-6318.",

She had four boys (Colin, Gregory, Anthony and Benedict) and four girls (Eloise, Hyacinth, Daphne and Francesca).\n\nViolet is in a foster home with other dogs, but is protective right now due to her puppies, so she is kept apart from them. She does not like cats and will chase them. Violet is shy upon meeting you, but then will melt in your arms and prefers to be held like a baby. Violet is a cuddle bug and will love to chill on your lap all day. She uses a dog door and enjoys sleeping in a crate. She is working on her leash manners and knows basic commands. Violet is great at jumping baby gates and will go exploring if given the opportunity. The only time Violet barks is when she is letting you know someone is approaching the home.\n\nIf you are interested in Violet, please fill out an application on our website so we can arrange a home check and meet/greet.\n\nHer adoption fee is $150 which will include her spay, 5-in-1 vaccine, Rabies vaccine, microchip and dewormer.",

While we don't know much about her past, we can tell you that this little lady is friendly, playful, and affectionate. She loves to play with her toys and is just as content being snuggled up in your arms. Muffin has been well-socialized with other dogs and would likely do well in a home with children. As with any dog, she would benefit from a structured daily routine and continued training once she settles into her new home.\n\nIn order to be considered as a potential adopter, we will need you to complete our online application at www.arrus.org. Should we choose to move forward with your family, you will be notified via email within the week. Due to the large volume of applications received, we are no longer able to respond to each and every applicant. We apologize in advance for the inconvenience and appreciate your understanding. \n\nAdditional information and/or medical records for this rescue pet are available and will be reviewed in person should we choose to move forward in scheduling a meet n\u2019 greet. In the meantime, please feel free to follow us on follow us on Instagram (animal_rescue_r_us) and visit our Facebook page at www.facebook.com/arrusadopt for more pictures and posts from his/her foster family. \n\nHELP US, HELP THEM! Animal Rescue R Us is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. We do not receive county, state or federal funding and rely solely on donations. These donations help offset the cost of routine veterinary care, medical expenses, and other necessities while the rescue animal is in our  care.

Should we choose to move forward with your family, you will be notified via email within the week. Due to the large volume of applications received, we are no longer able to respond to each and every applicant. We apologize in advance for the inconvenience and appreciate your understanding. \n\nAdditional information and/or medical records for this rescue pet are available and will be reviewed in person should we choose to move forward in scheduling a meet n\u2019 greet.

Anna Bea does very well with her potty manners again with supervision. She gets along well with other dogs and kitties.

Chihuahua experience is preferred for this girl and no small children due to her size. \nIf she is listed, she is available. First step to adoption is an application.

I am very smart and love to make you happy. I would love to go to puppy classes with you, it will be so much fun and I will be the star of the class! I am good with kids, dogs, and cats. I have your average puppy personality: silly, goofy, sweet, loving and AWESOME.  Want to adopt me?  \nInterested in becoming a forever home for Garland? Fill out our online adoption application: http://www.friendswithfourpaws.org/adoption-form.html This is the first step in our process, and we don't go any further without an application.\n\nFind more adoptable pets, news and information on Instagram @friendswithfourpaws or our Facebook page Friends with Four Paws .\n\nWe put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them and you.  Please do not submit an application if you are not serious about adopting Garland.\nWe are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and Garland the perfect forever home, and appreciate you working with us.  \n\nOur adoption fee is $525. This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.\n\nAll of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements for transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home AFTER an application is being processed.\n\nThank you in advance for your patience with our process and for making adoption YOUR option!",

            "description": "Sweet little Della decided she would hunt no more, forever. So her owner didn't want her anymore. But she is a really nice girl, so she came to Beagle Rescue. She's rather shy, but is motivated by treats and enjoys being petted. She only just arrived, so stay tuned for more info about her personality. We want to see her let her hair down a bit so we see her true personality and know what kind of home she needs.\nUpdate 01/23/21\nShe\u2019s still very skittish - she\u2019s leaning about what it means to live indoors. TV noise, opening the refrigerator, the Roomba - it\u2019s all still a little scary but she makes good progress every day! She is now peeing and pooping in the backyard but won\u2019t go on the leash (yet). She does walk nicely on a leash by herself and with my two others. She likes my other dogs and is very submissive. She\u2019s been eating well and enjoys getting a treat but sometimes she\u2019s too scared to take it from your hard. She enjoys being pet and will roll on to her back for attention. She slept through the night last night. She\u2019s gone in the crate with mixed results but she does like a \u201ccave\u201d to nap in.\n\nShe not outgoing personality wise or super eager to please so I\u2019m not sure agility would be something she would want to do. She is incredibly sweet and just needs to learn about indoor living and life with people.\n\nDella's Webpage - http://beaglemaryland.org/brsm_ms/vIndividualCurrentDog.aspx?dogid=69900\nAdoptable Dog Webpage - http://beaglemaryland.org/brsm_ms/vCurrentDogs.aspx\n\nIf you'd like to adopt one of our beagles:\n*Go to our Website - href=\"http://beaglemaryland.org\n*Review our  Standards for Adoption - http://beaglemaryland.org/Home.aspx?pg=standardsforadoption.htm\n*Fill out an Adopter Profile - \nhttp://brsmbeagles.org/new_site/documents/BRSM_profile_secure.pdf\n and email it to us (or print it off, fill it in and send it via regular mail, if you prefer)\n*A BRSM volunteer will contact you to guide you through the rest of the process!\n\nWe hope to hear from you, and so do the beagles!",

Vivian and Valerie are tan colored and Vivian is lighter and weighs 8.06 lbs.  These pups will be 8+ weeks old and ready for her forever home next weekend 2/6/21\nVivian loves her foster family and is with other dogs and a cat, she is with older, respectful children and is quiet and sweet, loves to play and loves her cuddles. If you are looking for a sweet pup to add to your family, please apply at yvpr.org/adoptions  \n\n\nAn application must be filled out and accepted before a meet can be set up. If accepted, you will hear from us within 72 hours. You will have the opportunity to ask questions before you meet the pet; an adoption may or may not happen at that time. We do adopt outside the Yakima area IF you are able to come to Yakima to pick up your adopted pet.  We do not have a kennel facility; all of our pets are in foster homes. Therefore, meets and adoptions take place at either our office or at a place chosen by the foster.   If a pet has 'pending' beside its name, an adoption is imminent. Please fill out an application anyway because adoptions don't always go through. Your application will be kept on file for 30 days in case you find another pet you'd like to apply for.  Thanks for thinking adoption and Good Luck!",

I am very smart and love to make you happy. I would love to go to puppy classes with you, it will be so much fun and I will be the star of the class! I am good with kids, dogs, and cats. I have your average puppy personality: silly, goofy, sweet, loving and AWESOME.  Want to adopt me?  \nInterested in becoming a forever home for Armani? Fill out our online adoption application: http://www.friendswithfourpaws.org/adoption-form.html This is the first step in our process, and we don't go any further without an application.\n\nFind more adoptable pets, news and information on Instagram @friendswithfourpaws or our Facebook page Friends with Four Paws .\n\nWe put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them and you.  Please do not submit an application if you are not serious about adopting Armani.\nWe are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and Armani the perfect forever home, and appreciate you working with us.  \n\nOur adoption fee is $525. This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.\n\nAll of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements for transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home AFTER an application is being processed.\n\nThank you in advance for your patience with our process and for making adoption YOUR option!",

Another three have made it out of the breeder circuit! Slowly, but surely, we are giving new life to dogs that have lived their lives in kennels. Zurich will be heading to our vet the week of 2/1/2021, for neutering, vaccinations, heartworm/fecal testing, etc. Stay tuned for more information.\n\nNOT TAKING APPLICATIONS: We are not taking applications yet. We will post when s(he) is ready for adoption. In the interest of fairness, EARLY application submissions will NOT be considered. Please note we cannot respond to messages/emails, etc., on dogs that are NOT yet available for adoption. Please wait until the dog is available for adoption.

I am very smart and love to make you happy. I would love to go to puppy classes with you, it will be so much fun and I will be the star of the class! I am good with kids, dogs, and cats. I have your average puppy personality: silly, goofy, sweet, loving and AWESOME.  Want to adopt me?  \nInterested in becoming a forever home for Summit? Fill out our online adoption application: http://www.friendswithfourpaws.org/adoption-form.html This is the first step in our process, and we don't go any further without an application.\n\nFind more adoptable pets, news and information on Instagram @friendswithfourpaws or our Facebook page Friends with Four Paws .\n\nWe put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them and you.  Please do not submit an application if you are not serious about adopting Summit.\nWe are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and Summit the perfect forever home, and appreciate you working with us.  \n\nOur adoption fee is $525. This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.\n\nAll of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements for transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home AFTER an application is being processed.\n\nThank you in advance for your patience with our process and for making adoption YOUR option!",

All furbabies are happy, healthy and growing big. They are in a foster home where they are exposed to other big and small dogs, kids, and lots of human contact. They are in the beginning stages of crate training and know what a dog door is.\n\nWe prefer they go to homes with other active dogs and an active family that will teach them puppy manners. They are not potty trained yet and chew on things they don't know aren't toys. They are eating puppy kibble and are weaned from mom.

Thank you!** \n\nThis young lady is Amelia, a 1-year old, 35-pound Treeing Walker Coonhound mix who needs a gentle touch.\n\nAmelia is a very sweet, good natured, and playful. She loves playing with her toys, which she mostly throws up in the air or across the room. \nShe is friendly with all dogs and cats. Every morning when she gets up, before going potty, she has to go through the house to tell all the other dogs and cats good morning.  \n\nAmelia likes going on walks, but she absolutely loves snuggling hugs and kisses. \n\nShe does need a gentle touch because she doesn\u2019t do well with a raised voices. She can be shy and skittish around new experiences.  Since she loves kind words and hugs, she gets nervous if there is shouting or yelling. \n\nIf you are an easy going family who enjoys playing outdoors and then snuggling on the couch, Amelia will fit right in.\n\nAll dogs are up to date on vaccinations and spayed/neutered at the time of adoption.  All dogs require professional training to become the best family member they can be.\n\nTo adopt or learn more about Amelia, you must fill out an adoption application. To find the application, copy and paste this URL into your browser: WWW.GDRNE.COM/ADOPTION-APPLICATION [Adoption Fee: $495]  **  PLEASE READ: If a dog is listed, then s/he is currently available for adoption. Their information is correct to the best of our abilities and the information we have been given as of the day of posting. Please note, GDRNE does not guarantee the breed of any dog or puppy unless stated that we have run DNA. All breeds listed are educated estimates. Our dogs are rescued from various situations. It is most likely that both their parents were strays and even if not, mixes of some sort and that their grandparents were mixes as well. The dog may have some genetic material of an American Staffordshire Terrier (pit bull). The dogs are usually mixes of many breeds, making them a breed all their own - a True and adorable American MUTT. If you are interested in this dog, you must submit an application. Great Dog is not a shelter so there is no building you can visit. Our dogs live in private foster homes until adopted. To learn more about our *shelterless* rescue, adoption fees, and procedures, review the list of Frequently Asked Questions on our website at WWW.GDRNE.COM.",

I am very smart and love to make you happy. I would love to go to puppy classes with you, it will be so much fun and I will be the star of the class! I am good with kids, dogs, and cats. I have your average puppy personality: silly, goofy, sweet, loving and AWESOME.  Want to adopt me?  \nInterested in becoming a forever home for Silas? Fill out our online adoption application: http://www.friendswithfourpaws.org/adoption-form.html This is the first step in our process, and we don't go any further without an application.\n\nFind more adoptable pets, news and information on Instagram @friendswithfourpaws or our Facebook page Friends with Four Paws .\n\nWe put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them and you.  Please do not submit an application if you are not serious about adopting Silas.\nWe are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and Silas the perfect forever home, and appreciate you working with us.  \n\nOur adoption fee is $525. This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.\n\nAll of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements for transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home AFTER an application is being processed.\n\nThank you in advance for your patience with our process and for making adoption YOUR option!",

Vanya and Violet are fluffy brindles and Vanya is a lighter color and weighs 8.10 lbs.  These pups will be 8+ weeks old and ready for her forever home next weekend 2/6/21\nVanya loves her foster family and is with other dogs and a cat, she is with older, respectful children and is quiet and sweet, loves to play and loves her cuddles. If you are looking for a sweet pup to add to your family, please apply at yvpr.org/adoptions  \n\n\nAn application must be filled out and accepted before a meet can be set up. If accepted, you will hear from us within 72 hours. You will have the opportunity to ask questions before you meet the pet; an adoption may or may not happen at that time. We do adopt outside the Yakima area IF you are able to come to Yakima to pick up your adopted pet.  We do not have a kennel facility; all of our pets are in foster homes. Therefore, meets and adoptions take place at either our office or at a place chosen by the foster.   If a pet has 'pending' beside its name, an adoption is imminent. Please fill out an application anyway because adoptions don't always go through. Your application will be kept on file for 30 days in case you find another pet you'd like to apply for.  Thanks for thinking adoption and Good Luck!",

I am very smart and love to make you happy. I would love to go to puppy classes with you, it will be so much fun and I will be the star of the class! I am good with kids, dogs, and cats. I have your average puppy personality: silly, goofy, sweet, loving and AWESOME.  Want to adopt me?  \nInterested in becoming a forever home for Sophie? Fill out our online adoption application: http://www.friendswithfourpaws.org/adoption-form.html This is the first step in our process, and we don't go any further without an application.\n\nFind more adoptable pets, news and information on Instagram @friendswithfourpaws or our Facebook page Friends with Four Paws .\n\nWe put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them and you.  Please do not submit an application if you are not serious about adopting Sophie.\nWe are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and Sophie the perfect forever home, and appreciate you working with us.  \n\nOur adoption fee is $525. This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.\n\nAll of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements for transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home AFTER an application is being processed.\n\nThank you in advance for your patience with our process and for making adoption YOUR option!",

            "description": "Willie Nelson, 2 year, 42 pounds\n\nWillie Nelson is an active, 42 pound doggo who loves attention. He is a smart boy and a quick learner. He sits when asked and will settle down to hang out with you after he's had his exercise. He would like daily walks or a secure yard to romp in, but we would not suggest leaving him alone outdoors as he is an avid fence climber. Willie does have a bit of separation anxiety. He would not be a good candidate for crate training, as he has been known to injure his nose trying to get out of the crate. Willie would do best in a household where someone is home most of the time. He wants to be your only fur-kid and no children. If you're looking for a buddy to spend lots of time with then meet Willie Nelson!\n\nIf interested, visit THHS.org. Click on Willie's picture to find the adopt me link to the application. A staff member will review all applications and if approved will call you to set up a meet and greet appointment. For questions please email adopt@THHS.org\n\nADOPTION INCLUDES: Spay or Neuter,Worming,Vaccinations (excluding rabies), Microchip, Free Vet visit at Participating Offices, 30 Days of Health Insurance provided by PetHealth (some restrictions apply). Adoption Fees may vary, but our standard fees are: Kittens and Cats $85, Puppies $175, and Dogs $125. We offer Discounts on Senior Animals and Special Needs Animals. We also offer special incentives for Seniors and Military.",

            "description": "Clyde, 4 year, 73 pounds\n\nClyde is a 73 pound sweetheart. He's a little shy at first but if you just give him a chance he will warm up to you and show you his true personality. He loves to play with toys. He listens to instructions very well, but needs an assertive instructor. He can be energetic and plays too rough to be placed with children under 12 years of age. He tends to be more gentle with women when it comes to toy behavior. He loves tennis balls and playing fetch! He is not a fan of cats, but previously lived with a female dog and may do okay with female dogs. Clyde needs a lot of space to run and is waiting to find his forever family!\n\nIf interested, visit THHS.org. Click on Clyde's picture to find the adopt me link to the application. A staff member will review all applications and if approved will call you to set up a meet and greet appointment. For questions please email adopt@THHS.org\n\nADOPTION INCLUDES: Spay or Neuter,Worming,Vaccinations (excluding rabies), Microchip, Free Vet visit at Participating Offices, 30 Days of Health Insurance provided by PetHealth (some restrictions apply). Adoption Fees may vary, but our standard fees are: Kittens and Cats $85, Puppies $175, and Dogs $125. We offer Discounts on Senior Animals and Special Needs Animals.

All furbabies are happy, healthy and growing big. They are in a foster home where they are exposed to other big and small dogs, kids, and lots of human contact. They are in the beginning stages of crate training and know what a dog door is.\n\nWe prefer they go to homes with other active dogs and an active family that will teach them puppy manners. They are not potty trained yet and chew on things they don't know aren't toys. They are eating puppy kibble and are weaned from mom. If you are interested in a puppy, please fill out an application on our website so we can arrange a home check and meet/greet.\n\nTheir adoption fee is $300 which will include their spay/neuter, 3-4 sets of puppy vaccines, Rabies vaccine, microchip and dewormer (all age appropriate).",

She is currently going through Heartworm treatment.\n\n*Gloria needs a fenced in yard unless you are an active family*\n\nMy name is Gloria and I am a 1 1/2 year old, 23lb full blooded lemon beagle. I love to use my nose and get into trouble, but can you blame me I was born a beagle. I love toys and food soo much they make me forget I have manners but it's definitely a plus for training (foster mom is working on). I love other dogs, cats kinda scare me I have never seen one of those so I choose to stay clear of them. I don't like my crate but I will go in perfect and am crate trained and potty trained. I love everything and everyone I am a very social girl. I love outside and to go for walks or just to hang out in the backyard. I am an escape artist though so I must have a secured fenced. I am a bed hog and will cuddle you for days if you let me. I love to be the center of attention. I self entertain if I have toys and bones around me. If you think you could make me your world and spoil me rotten please put in an application. Www.4paws4rescue.com",

I am very smart and love to make you happy. I would love to go to puppy classes with you, it will be so much fun and I will be the star of the class! I am good with kids, dogs, and cats. I have your average puppy personality: silly, goofy, sweet, loving and AWESOME.  Want to adopt me?  \nInterested in becoming a forever home for Snow? Fill out our online adoption application: http://www.friendswithfourpaws.org/adoption-form.html This is the first step in our process, and we don't go any further without an application.\n\nFind more adoptable pets, news and information on Instagram @friendswithfourpaws or our Facebook page Friends with Four Paws .\n\nWe put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them and you.  Please do not submit an application if you are not serious about adopting Snow.\nWe are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and Snow the perfect forever home, and appreciate you working with us.  \n\nOur adoption fee is $525. This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.\n\nAll of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements for transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home AFTER an application is being processed.\n\nThank you in advance for your patience with our process and for making adoption YOUR option!",

            "description": "Cookie is so gentle and SO sweet and affectionate. She is about 6 or 7 years old and 40 lbs of love. She is still very playful and is great with other dogs (we can cat test). Cookie is snuggly and just an all round wonderful companion. She has clearly had too many litters of puppies, but that is all over and done with now. She is just a super companion dog, in need of a loving forever home. A must meet, for she will steal your heart for sure. CRPUPS@PTD.NET to contact us for any reason. (If you do not hear back from us within about 6 hours, send us your phone number, for there might be something wrong with your email! WE DO NOT TEXT) \nLovable Mutts Adoption Center is a private, in home, all breed rescue/adoption facility, specializing in all ages and sizes of dogs.  We exist only on the kindness of your donations and adoptions!  We pride ourselves on being an HOLISTIC center and feed only holistic grain free foods and give daily, various, vitamins and supplements to all of our dogs. \n\nOur dogs are well socialized, very friendly, well mannered, affectionate, and in wonderful health. While some might be timid or shy, we work with our adopters in any way we can, to help them to work with their new family member. We give training tips and behavioral tips and even board for a very reasonable fee. Our dogs are extremely well cared for - most even know how to use a dog door by the time they leave us, know basic commands, and are crate trained!  We stand by our pups/dogs, and give 10 days for a refund and almost always take our dogs back at any age of their lives (can sometimes depend on the dog)! \n\nLovable Mutts Adoption Center has an application screening process.  All applicants are asked to provide vet references, personal references, and a home visit.  We pride ourselves in matching up the right dog with the right home.  Sometimes this happens quickly and sometimes it might take awhile.  We hope you understand and are willing to wait for the perfect pup for your situation. We reserve the right to turn applicants down and to change our mind about a suitable match, for we are only concerned about what is best for our dogs.  Also note that we arrange our visiting hours around your schedule, as this is a private, in home facility.  We respond to all inquiries promptly, so if you have any trouble sending us an email, or have not heard back from us within 24 hours, please, CONTACT US AGAIN and check your spam!  (We all know how emails can be at times!)\n\nOur dogs are spayed or neutered (if old enough), up to date on vaccines, wormed, heartworm tested, and free of fleas and ticks.  We temperament test our  dogs and they are all suitable for many family situations. Our dogs are well mannered,  and are in our family/home situation at this time (not kept in kennels or crates), and are worked with daily.  All of our dogs do well with other dogs and many do well with cats, and we can cat test. Adoption donations vary with age, breed, vetting, and training of the dog, and range from $250 to $500. This donation helps to pay for shots, de-wormings, spays, neuters, flea protection, heartworm/Lyme testing, treatments, and other vetting/issues that might be needed, for dogs in our care.  (We do not tend to place puppies or small dogs with kids under 6 and reserve the right to match who WE feel would be the best homes for our dogs.)  \nPlease, come adopt one of our Lovable Mutts - you will be so glad you did!\n\n(IF YOU DO NOT GET A REPLY EMAIL WITHIN 24 HOURS, CHECK YOUR SPAM BOX - WE REPLY EVERY FEW HOURS TO EMAILS)",

Oh, and an endless supply of tasty treats. I know I'm ready to go home with you so, what are you waiting for? I am full grown at ~20 lbs. Cats/Children? Unknown. Dogs? I may do best as your one and only. Housetrained? I've almost got it! Training needs? I bet I can learn anything you want to teach me with the right treats! Energy level? Low to medium. How did I get here? Adopted and returned due to some dog selective behaviors. ~My adoption fee is $95.00.~",

She also had an issue with her front leg. We suspect it\u2019s because she is so overweight and possibly sprained it being pushed out of the car. It seems to be improving.

Due to COVID concerns, only Texas applicants will be considered.\n\nBIO UPDATE: 01/25/21. Baxter had surgery last week for his neuter and to fix the hole in the roof of his mouth. The vet has no idea how it happened, however it is definitely from an injury. The vet performed a skin graft, however 3 days later Baxter somehow managed to rip the stitches and the hole is back. He has a consultation with a specialist on February 2, where they'll tell us what can be done. He's eating well, now that the foster mom has found a thick pate he can just swallow that doesn't go into his sinuses. He's a happy boy who loves sleeping in foster mom and dad's bed, and demands belly rubs in the morning upon waking up. Potty training is going well, and he even has asked to go outside a few times.\n\nBaxter would be happy in a home as an only dog, or small dogs (he gets along with those fine). Cats and larger dogs we would not recommend. He is also great with kids. Foster mom will update more after his consultation! If you'd like more info on Baxter, you can reach her at rescuesreallyrock@gmail.com.\n\nINITIAL BIO. 12/08/20. Howdy! My name is Baxter. Nice to meet you! I had been residing in a shelter in North Texas, where I was taken as I was roaming the streets. No one has come to get me though, so the nice folks at UYR took me in! My foster mom just got me groomed and oh my gosh do I feel and look better! Like, is there a Tinder for dogs? (Oh, won't need that as they're getting me neutered next week anyway....oh well). My foster mom said she'll know more about how house trained I am after that...I will say I have not done #2 in the house! I even asked to go outside last night.\n\nOne fun fact about me is that I have no teeth. I think it makes me pretty special (hello, cute tongue hanging out)! My foster mom found a nice thick pate she cuts up that I can eat just fine! I need to gain some weight so that's perfect for me (I'm about 11 lbs right now...and gaining!). I get along great with other dogs....my foster family has 2 small and 2 big ones; I like 'em all! Cats? Not so much. I like their human kids, though! They give me belly rubs a lot....that's a favorite. I do sleep all night in a little bed they got me that is next to their bed.\n\nAs far as my age....well, I am not sure! The dogtor says I am \"middle aged\". My foster mom is too, and she said that's a pretty good age to be. If you think you may be the right furever home for me, you can reach out to my foster mom at rescuesreallyrock@gmail.com. Thanks!",

            "description": "Hi, I'm Prince Brownie and I'm technically a 2 year old Chow, but my foster dad just calls me a 60lb ball of fluff. I really enjoy hanging around with my humans, but also love to zoom around with other dogs. I used to be a little leery of being inside of a house because I grew up outside, but I have quickly gotten used to the idea of being inside and don't want to ever go back. I currently am living with a 30 lb puppy Golden Retriever and a 60lb Boxer, and we get along great! I was not very used to being walked on a leash when I first got here, but I've been working on it and have made tremendous progress. I'm really just looking for someone that will feed me, because I really like food. It doesn't matter what kind of food either, seriously I will be best friends with whoever will feed me the most. I'm pretty big into cuddling, so if you're looking to find someone to hang out on the couch and snack with, I am your guy and you should fill out an application today! My adoption fee is $250.\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

We are not sur what she is mixed with but she does have large webbed feet. :)    Weighing in at 68 lbs   Her story is a sad one.. Adopted as a puppy she has spent most of her life  tied out in a Virginia  She really does not understand human touch, walking on a leash or  trust.   Allowed to get pregnant.. She had her pups alone in a dog house  She was fed regularly but showed no love.  Once the pups started being more of a nuiceances that cute.. THe owner surrereded THe family.   to the shelter.   WE were asked if we would be itnerested in helping them and we said yes.   Bianca has been with us for a few days and has made small improvements.. She is walking better on a leash  She will wait to be taken out and has had very few accidents in her kennel.   She is not spayed but when is more socialized will be taken to our vet.  She is current with rabies, heartworm negative .  She would require a home that is  calm  and would be willing to help her come out of her shell ..  I am sure once she does she will be an amazing dog.  School age kids would be preferred  as I am sure she has never been introduced to smaller ones.    She is definitely  a diamond in the ruff.\n\n\n1. This rescue is run out of a private home please do not email asking to meet the dog unless you have an application submitted or you have an application that has been approved 6months or less\n2.  The information that we have is current and to the best of our knowledge when we learn more about the dog's personality we immediately post that.\n3.   All of our dogs are good with school-age children. And will do fine with that as long as your child is good and respects dogs boundaries\n4. Please visit our Facebook page. Pictures and updates are posted there first.  \n\n5. All of our rescue dogs have the following\n\nSpay or neuter certificates\n\nvaccination records including Rabies\n\nAre on a monthly flea and heartworm preventive. \n\nCrate leash and house trained. \n\nGet along with other dogs ( otherwise indicated )\n\nEnjoy the company of school-age children who are respectful to them \n\nMost of them enjoy the company of cats as well, HOWEVER, in the past, we have found out that for some reason that is not always the case.  \n\nWe work VERY hard making sure our dogs acclimate to their new homes.  We seek adopters whose current pets are current on vaccinations and are altered. {\n\nPLEASE do not fill out an application if your pets are not. You will be denied.\n\n\nApplications can be found by going to our website  www.laurashoperescue.com\n\n",

Thank you!** \n\nMeet Meiko, a 3-year old, 50-pound Catahoula Leopard Dog/American Bulldog mix gal.\n\nMeiko is a very sweet loving girl who has not had an easy early life. Her prior owners bred her often. In her last litter she had only two pups that were very weak and died. The owners then surrendered Meiko to a rescue center because she was no longer producing puppies for them. \n\nMeiko quickly acclimated to her foster home. She gets along great with other dogs, loves attention, getting petted, lounging about and being with her people. \n\nShe has been around older children. She will make a great gal who likes to go on walks then lay on the couch with her people. \n\nShe has an adorable voice and can be a \u201ctalker.\u201d (She\u2019s not a barker at all, but will talk for attention). \n\nAll dogs are up to date on vaccinations and spayed/neutered at the time of adoption.  All dogs require professional training to become the best family member they can be.\n\nTo adopt or learn more about Meiko, you must fill out an adoption application. To find the application, copy and paste this URL into your browser: WWW.GDRNE.COM/ADOPTION-APPLICATION [Adoption Fee: $495]  **  PLEASE READ: If a dog is listed, then s/he is currently available for adoption. Their information is correct to the best of our abilities and the information we have been given as of the day of posting. Please note, GDRNE does not guarantee the breed of any dog or puppy unless stated that we have run DNA. All breeds listed are educated estimates. Our dogs are rescued from various situations. It is most likely that both their parents were strays and even if not, mixes of some sort and that their grandparents were mixes as well. The dog may have some genetic material of an American Staffordshire Terrier (pit bull). The dogs are usually mixes of many breeds, making them a breed all their own - a True and adorable American MUTT. If you are interested in this dog, you must submit an application. Great Dog is not a shelter so there is no building you can visit. Our dogs live in private foster homes until adopted. To learn more about our *shelterless* rescue, adoption fees, and procedures, review the list of Frequently Asked Questions on our website at WWW.GDRNE.COM.",

She is around several other dogs ranging from 3 lbs up to 15 lbs with no issues. She takes a little time to warm up but bonds quickly once she does. She needs to go to a chihuahua experienced home. Adoption fee is $175.00. Clair is spayed, just had a dental, vaccinated, microchipped, and heart worm negative.

            "description": "Hey there, Heinicke here! I was tired of life on the streets, so one day I followed a nice stranger home and after hanging out on the porch for a while together, we met some nice people who took me to HRA. I'm a super friendly guy who loves to be petted. If you sit down near me, you are likely to find my paws placed gently in your lap and my happy face looking to gain your attention. My foster dad, Nathaniel, bought me a bunch of fun toys and I like to play with them, the Kong in particular, but I'm really more interested in spending time with a human. I have been with my foster dad for a few days now and have been acclimating quite well. Because I have lots of energy and lovins to give, we're working on sit, stay, down, and place so I can calm down when I need to. I'm super food-motivated which is great because I'm learning a lot! While I really don't love the lead collar Nathaniel's using when we walk, I am not pulling on leash as much! While on leash, I'm not very interested in other creatures like dogs, squirrels, or little humans; I just go about my merry way, wagging my little hiney as we go along. I also think I'll be best for a loving family who doesn't have other dogs -- I have more than enough love to share on my own! \n\nFor more info, or to virtually meet me, contact AdoptHeinicke@gmail.com.",

My little teeth like to stick out of my mouth and it looks like I am smiling! I love to cuddle and be pet, but my favorite thing to do is wrestle with my foster sister and chase her around the house and yard. I have a lot of puppy energy, so I need a friend who will play with me. I am potty trained and know the doggy door. I sleep quietly in my crate at night, but don't like it so much when you leave, so an apartment would not be a good home fore me. I will chew on things I'm not supposed to, so I need to be crated when you are not watching me. But I listen very well if you tell me to stop it. I am learning not to jump and get under foster moms feet, but I still need a lot of reminders because I just get so darn excited to see her! I am eager to learn, and eager to please, so a basic training class would be super duper fun for me! I am shy at first, so I would also like to work more on meeting new people. My ideal family would be active and lots of fun!\n\nPLEASE READ: Please read all information about this pet provided.

            "description": "KOOKIE is a sweetie...male, Dachshund mix, about 7 mos old (DOB: 6/15/20.  In foster in W Wa. He weighs 13.80#.  He's a little shy to strangers but warms up with food.  He was owned by a little old lady that no longer could keep him.  She never did officially name him but would always ask him if he wanted a \"cookie\" and he started thinking that was his name.  So...to keep him a 'boy'... I named him Kookie.  He will make a good pet/companion for a couple or single person.  I wouldn't recommend children because of his shyness.  He does like to sleep on my bed.  He's just a sweetie.  We are working on house training.\n\nThis dog is available now to pre adopt directly from us the rescue in TX.  Adoptions include neuter/spay, vaccinations (DHPP, Bordetella, Rabies), microchip, transport with OUR professional dog transporter, and 6 mos of heartworm prevention. You can ask us about how pre adoption works and our 'trial period'.\n\nIf you have any questions, text me...  210-394-6060.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out the on-line application. Yes you must COPY and PASTE the application link .\nhttp://shaynesrescue.com/adoption-application-pet-central-satx/\n\nYou can also go to our Facebook page...\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Pet-Central-SATX-866684826744181/\nand LIKE us to help us out.\n\nGET IN LINE FIRST: If you are interested in this dog, please fill out the application (link listed above). The rescue will contact you once the application is received. Although we strive to answer everyone, due to the high volume of inquiries we receive, we cannot guarantee a response to all emails. Filling out the application is the ONLY way to ensure a response from the rescue. In addition, while you are emailing us, if others apply, you lose out adopting the dog you chose. We have hundreds of puppies/dogs available so there really is no need to apply anywhere else.  Also, one application is good even if you are interested in several different dogs...one application no matter which one you choose.  We try to make it as easy as possible for you but if you are applying or have applied anywhere else, we do need to know that, too.\n\nSHANYE'S FOSTERS is a group of foster parents in the Olympia/Tumwater area. We foster dogs for rescues and assist them in adopting/rehoming of their pups/dogs by listing on this site. Many dogs posted here are available to pre adopt NOW directly from the rescue. The only ones in foster in the NW specifically state that. We have very few fosters so most need to be pre adopted. All adoption fees go towards rescuing more dogs in need. No one receives a salary. Shayne's Fosters is not responsible for any experience you have with any dog you might see posted on this site. They are the property of the sponsoring rescue who will supply all medical supporting records which is given with each dog when adopted.\n\nOur adoption fees cover all medical costs to make sure the pups are appropriately vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, and spayed/ neutered. It also covers the cost of transport from Texas and the necessary health certificate documentation. The fees also include a negative heartworm test for any dogs over 6 months. Some dogs have additional medical, such as FHO, ACL, hernias, dental, and a myriad of other vetting.  We do full disclosure of medical care/situations. If the adoption fees seem high (which never cover the true cost of rescue), we recommend fostering for a good rescue. Fostering ensures you incur no vet bills and no boarding fees. We are always in need of good fosters. We are all volunteers who donate our time and resources to help save as many dogs/pups lives as we possibly can.\n\nThank you for choosing to adopt a rescue pup/dog. Over 1 billion dogs worldwide are put to sleep (PTS) annually... thousands daily.  The dog pounds PTS entire litters, pregnant/nursing moms and wonderful dogs that can make someone a great companion. We firmly believe there is NO breed other than \"rescue\" for all species. Thank you for being part of the village it takes to save these precious lives.",

She is slowly learning how live in a home and be a pet. \nExpected to be about 2-3 years old and some sort of hound mix weighing 48lbs full grown. \nShe is potty trained and does wonderfully left out alone in the house for the day while no one is home. \nShe is timid with new people and scared of loud noises, but every day  with reassurance from her foster family, she is learning that not everyone is like the people who let her down leaving her on her own. \nShe loves just lounging around the house, snuggling up to you if you are near. She\u2019s learning to love pets, and adores having her ears rubbed. \nWe haven\u2019t figured out toys yet, but she does like to carry them around. She is very curious and wants to learn as much as she can and will follow you around the house investigating everything you do. \nBreezy is heartworm positive and is beginning treatment. She will be scheduled to be spayed after that, so no more puppies for this sweet momma! \nShe is good with other dogs and older kids. We\u2019re not sure about cats. \nShe would love for you to open up your home and be your sweet snuggly shadow!\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq\n\n*Any breed labels used by Take Paws Rescue, its employees/volunteers, or on vet records provided cannot be guaranteed.  Breed labels are given based on information obtained during intake and/or best guesses based on appearance and/or temperament of the dogs and Take Paws Rescue gives no assurance to the accuracy of these labels. Labels are necessary for postings to many animal networking sites, such as Pet Finder, and are no way a guarantee. Additionally, exact age and potential size cannot be guaranteed.",

            "description": "\"Hello there!  Thank you for stopping by to read about me!  I recently joined the adoptable doggy crew at Providence Animal Center's lifesaving facility after traveling here from Arkansas, and I am hoping you will stop by soon to meet me in person!  \n\nMy name is Sweet Pea, and I'm around 2 years old and a petite 28 pounds.  I'm all set to join my new family - already spayed, microchipped and up to date on vaccinations.  \n\nI'm new to PAC, but before I made the trip here, the wonderful people in Arkansas got to know me pretty well. Here are some things they wanted to pass along about me: \n\n'Sweet Pea was originally a stray. She had found her way to an elderly gentleman's house where she was taken care of for several months. Sweet Pea is an amazing dog but was just too energetic for the elderly man. She walks on a leash, is house trained, can use a dog door and a crate. She's been good with other dogs, did very good with children, playful and very social. She's loving, eager to engage and play with everyone and has a happy wiggly sweet disposition.'\n\nSo do I sound like your new BFF??!  Then, if you are interested in meeting me, please schedule an appointment here: ProvidenceAC.org/AdoptADog. My paws are crossed I will see you very soon! \nXOXO Sweet Pea\"\n\n-------\nDuring your appointment, you will be able to meet a selection of pets in the Kennels or Cattery that day. New pets are arriving daily!\n-------\n\nProvidence Animal Center relies on adoption fees and donations to save pets! Adoption fees vary per pet. To find out this pet\u2019s adoption fee or for more information, please call the Adoption Center with this pet\u2019s ID number.\n\nCan\u2019t adopt? Consider fostering or donating! Visit https://providenceac.org/support-us/ for more information on how you can support the lifesaving mission!",

I love attention and will ask for loving if you don't volunteer to pay attention to me.  I like to play and I am an active girl. I have learned how to use a doggie door and sleep in a kennel at night without making a sound until morning. I can be microchipped with a voucher from the rescue.\n\nPlease come see me at our adoption events at Jake's Feed in Longview, TX on the 2nd and 4th Saturday of each month from 10am - 3pm or by appointment to approved applicants.

Fill out our online adoption application: http://www.friendswithfourpaws.org/adoption-form.html This is the first step in our process, and we don't go any further without an application.\n\nFind more adoptable pets, news and information on Instagram @friendswithfourpaws or our Facebook page Friends with Four Paws .\n\nWe put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them and you.  Please do not submit an application if you are not serious about adopting Scrappy.\nWe are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and Scrappy the perfect forever home, and appreciate you working with us.  \nFor immediate consideration, please attach your application to the initial inquiry to help us expedite the process.\n\nOur adoption fee is $525. This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.\n\nAll of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements for transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home AFTER an application is being processed.\n\nThank you in advance for your patience with our process and for making adoption YOUR option!",

As a high energy dog, having a companion to play with and a fenced yard is key to her happiness and probably yours. As a herding dog who occasionally likes to nip (a standard trait of cattle dogs), she would be better with older children. Please research cattle dogs. They are very intelligent dogs and are best suited to experienced dog owners.",

            "description": "Meet Gabby! \n\nGabby is around 8-12 months old and weighs 65 pounds.  We believe she is an Anatolian Shepherd/Australian Shepherd mix.\n\nShe is very sweet, loving and obedient.  She did great at the vet and had bloodwork done. \n\nInterested in becoming a forever home for Gabby? Fill out our online adoption application: http://www.friendswithfourpaws.org/adoption-form.html This is the first step in our process, and we don't go any further without an application.\n\nFind more adoptable pets, news and information on Instagram @friendswithfourpaws or our Facebook page Friends with Four Paws .\n\nWe put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them and you.  Please do not submit an application if you are not serious about adopting Gabby.\nWe are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and Gabby the perfect forever home, and appreciate you working with us.  \nFor immediate consideration, please attach your application to the initial inquiry to help us expedite the process.\n\nOur adoption fee is $525. This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.\n\nAll of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements for transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home AFTER an application is being processed.\n\nThank you in advance for your patience with our process and for making adoption YOUR option!",

It does not seem to effect him much - however we would like whomever adopts Cole Beasley to do some puppy training with a local trainer that has experience with sensory impaired dogs, to make sure he gets started off on the right paw! Part of his fee will be refunded once the adopter completes training. \nCole Beasley is neutered, up to date on vaccines, micro-chipped, and current on flea prevention.

She is crate trained but not house trained or able to walk on a leash yet!  \n\n\nInterested in becoming a forever home for Paisley? Fill out our online adoption application: http://www.friendswithfourpaws.org/adoption-form.html This is the first step in our process, and we don't go any further without an application.\n\nFind more adoptable pets, news and information on Instagram @friendswithfourpaws or our Facebook page Friends with Four Paws .\n\nWe put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them and you.  Please do not submit an application if you are not serious about adopting Paisley.\nWe are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and Paisley the perfect forever home, and appreciate you working with us.  \nFor immediate consideration, please attach your application to the initial inquiry to help us expedite the process.\n\nOur adoption fee is $525. This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.\n\nAll of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements for transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home AFTER an application is being processed.\n\nThank you in advance for your patience with our process and for making adoption YOUR option!",

            "description": "Cookie is as scrumptious as a fresh batch of her namesake coming right out of the oven, all gooey and warm. She is a young mid-sized girl who loves people, dogs and playtime. Cookie is searching for her perfect home with a canine companion and a fenced-in yard for them to play in. She rides well in the car, and knows \"sit\", \"lay down\" and \"come\". She is still working on her leash skills and not getting overly excited and jumping when she makes new friends. She is treat motivated, which should make learning these things a breeze, and takes her treats so sweetly. Cookie also knows not to beg for food. While she may be hesitant to go in her crate - she'd rather be where her family is! - she does settle down and behave nicely inside and will sleep through the night. Cookie would prefer an adult only home, preferring a bit less chaos and a lot more love. So pour yourself a big ole' glass of milk and submit your adoption request at savinggracenc.org to meet Cookie!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Meet Leamon! Born around December 2017, he is a smaller guy with an optimal weight around 75 pounds.\n\nThis poor boy has had a rough life. He was found as a stray when he wandered up to people setting up a fireworks stand on the outskirts of Dallas. He was thin, had no collar, an injured eye, and seemed to have trouble with his hind leg. After some trepidation and escaping a new collar, he rode home in the lap of his rescuer.\n\nLeamon's medical evaluation revealed that his pelvis had an old break causing leg pain. Due to the age of the injury, surgery is not an option. He happily takes a joint supplement and fish oil with his kibbles. These aids help prevent the pain. He may occasionally require meloxicam if he becomes sore.\n\nLeamon needs to maintain his healthy weight to keep his hips from hurting. He will have trouble if he becomes chubby.\n\nHe also has an old eye injury that also does not need surgery. The eye appears small, but he still has some limited vision in it. He tends to be easily surprised when things come at him from that side.\n\nOn top of all that, he has some old hot spots and red stains on his fur from not eating right. He also has allergies to chicken products. Luckily, his skin and coat are clearing up as he continues his new healthy food intake.\n\nSweet Leamon is initially shy around new people, but he warms up quickly. He's been getting braver every day.\n\nHe is definitely more confident and outgoing with dogs than with people. He is nice to canines and cats. He plays with toys for short periods of time.\n\nLeamon is house trained and crate trained. While he was at first very opposed to leashes, he now accepts them, and his leash work is improving as he builds confidence.\n\nLeamon needs a lower energy home without stairs. Because he startles easily due to his limited vision, a home without small children would be best.\n\nIt may take some time for him to become the beautiful dog he is meant to be. He will soon have a gorgeous coat to match his long fan tail.\n\nSPIN Pyrs are all in foster homes in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. Potential adopters are asked to make travel arrangements if they live elsewhere. All SPIN dogs are spayed or neutered, current on vaccinations and on heartworm prevention. Please go to our website www.SpinRescue.org and fill out an application for this great Great Pyrenees!",

We believe Jacque to be around 4 months old. \nHe is somewhat timid at first but let him loose and watch him zoom around, pick him up and see him turn into a cuddle bug.\nJacque's adoption fee is $300. This goes toward helping more animals in need.\nHe will be neutered on the 22nd of February , up to date on his vaccines and microchipped.\nIf you feel like you can give Jacque a wonderful home , you can fill out an application at\nfurfriends4life.org/adoptionapplication/\nAny further questions feel free to call/text 661-431-4607\nOr email at\nfurfriends4liferescue@gmail.com",

            "description": "Please go to www.yvpr.org/adoptions for more information and to complete an adoption application. \nWiley is a 12 week old mixed breed female puppy that is sable and tan, has a dense coat and currently weighs 15.5 pounds. She came to us after being found and weighing under 1 pound, she was syringe fed until she could eat on her own and had several veterinary visits to help us keep her healthy and understand what was happening to her eyes...she has vision in her left eye and not in her right and this does not slow her down in the least, we are not considering her to special needs at all since she has never known any different and is just like any other puppy.  When Wiley is old enough to be spayed, she will have her right eye removed at the same time and can come back to her foster family to have this done in April if her adopter wishes. This girl is active and playful, she loves her people and loves other dogs of all sizes and ages, she is working on house training, she has not met a cat and since she is active and curious, we believe she would do best with no cats (given she has one eye) \nWiley has had 3 vaccinations/boosters and a DNA test done, she is Siberian  Husky, Labrador Retriever, Alaskan Malamute, chow chow and 37% herding breeds (shepherd, heeler)\nif you would like to meet this miracle pup, please apply at yvpr.org/adoptions\n\n An application must be filled out and accepted before a meet can be set up. If accepted, you will hear from us within 72 hours. You will have the opportunity to ask questions before you meet the pet; an adoption may or may not happen at that time. We do adopt outside the Yakima area IF you are able to come to Yakima to pick up your adopted pet.  We do not have a kennel facility; all of our pets are in foster homes. Therefore, meets and adoptions take place at either our office or at a place chosen by the foster.   If a pet has 'pending' beside its name, an adoption is imminent. Please fill out an application anyway because adoptions don't always go through. Your application will be kept on file for 30 days in case you find another pet you'd like to apply for.  Thanks for thinking adoption and Good Luck!",

            "description": "Meet  Gumball! \n\nGumball is a 4-6-year-old 72# Labrador retriever. He is a loving dog that is very obedient and only wants to please. He does great with older kids, 9-10 years old and over. He doesn\u2019t much appreciate young children. \n\nHe walks great on a leash and gets along well with all the dogs, cats and people he meets. \n\nHe has been a country dog and may need some adjustment living in a more urban environment.\n\nInterested in becoming a forever home for Gumball? Fill out our online adoption application: http://www.friendswithfourpaws.org/adoption-form.html This is the first step in our process, and we don't go any further without an application.\n\nFind more adoptable pets, news and information on Instagram @friendswithfourpaws or our Facebook page Friends with Four Paws .\n\nWe put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them and you.  Please do not submit an application if you are not serious about adopting Gumball.\nWe are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and Gumball the perfect forever home, and appreciate you working with us.  \nFor immediate consideration, please attach your application to the initial inquiry to help us expedite the process.\n\nOur adoption fee is $525. This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.\n\nAll of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements for transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home AFTER an application is being processed.\n\nThank you in advance for your patience with our process and for making adoption YOUR option!",

He had his surgery and is completely healed.  He is a sweet boy who loves walks, attention and food.  He gets along with all dogs and just minds his own business.  He has completed his three weeks of obedience training.  Astro had selective hearing and didn\u2019t always follow direction, kind of like a teenager.  He has now learned, sit, stay, come and all those other manners that dogs should have.  His hyper-active personality is now in check and he has mellowed with structure and direction that he learned in training.   Sounds like the perfect boy.  We aren\u2019t sure but we think he is chi weenie with just enough of something else to give him a cute underbite  (he could use some braces).  I wish we knew every dog\u2019s history and always wonder who they are and where they came from.  Something we will never know in Astro\u2019s case.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Astro please complete an application.\n\nHttps://dachshundsandfriends.org/adoption-application/",

She is pushy and playful and bouncy and needs a bully breed experienced home. She loves humans and other dogs, and we can cat test. This petite girl is all wiggles and happiness. A must meet, for she will steal your heart for sure. (Fostered in PA - We do not text) (If you do not hear back from us within about 6 hours, send us your phone number, for there is clearly something wrong with your email!) Dog's Best Friend Adoption Center utilizes an adoption application and screening process. We require personal and vet references and a home check made prior to adopting one of our dogs. All of our dogs are companion animals that must be kept inside the house with the rest of the family members. All of our dogs are temperament tested, well mannered, and know some basic commands ~ they are worked with daily, as someone is always here with them. All of our dogs do well with other dogs and many do well with cats. Adoption donations range from $250 to $450, depending on breed, age, size, vetting, and training of the dog (some pure bred and tiny dog fees are higher). This donation helps to pay for shots, de-wormings, spays, neuters, flea protection, heartworm/Lyme testing, treatments, and other vetting/issues that might be needed, for dogs in our care. Dog's Best Friend dogs truly make wonderful family pets. Please  email us for an application. (If you email us and do not hear back from us within 24 hours, please try again, as we most likely did not receive your email!) (Also note that many of our dogs are fostered just across the border into PA)",

She is about 30 pounds and she just raised her last litter of eight puppies and is ready for her forever home.  She is very sweet, loving and does pretty well on a leash.\n\nInterested in becoming a forever home for Hazel? Fill out our online adoption application: http://www.friendswithfourpaws.org/adoption-form.html This is the first step in our process, and we don't go any further without an application.\n\nFind more adoptable pets, news and information on Instagram @friendswithfourpaws or our Facebook page Friends with Four Paws .\n\nWe put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them and you.  Please do not submit an application if you are not serious about adopting Hazel.\nWe are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and Hazel the perfect forever home, and appreciate you working with us.  \nFor immediate consideration, please attach your application to the initial inquiry to help us expedite the process.\n\nOur adoption fee is $525. This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.\n\nAll of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements for transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home AFTER an application is being processed.\n\nThank you in advance for your patience with our process and for making adoption YOUR option!",

She is pushy and playful and bouncy and needs a bully breed experienced home. She loves humans and other dogs, and we can cat test. This petite girl is all wiggles and happiness. A must meet, for she will steal your heart for sure. CRPUPS@PTD.NET to contact us for any reason. (If you do not hear back from us within about 6 hours, send us your phone number, for there might be something wrong with your email! WE DO NOT TEXT) \nLovable Mutts Adoption Center is a private, in home, all breed rescue/adoption facility, specializing in all ages and sizes of dogs.  We exist only on the kindness of your donations and adoptions!  We pride ourselves on being an HOLISTIC center and feed only holistic grain free foods and give daily, various, vitamins and supplements to all of our dogs. \n\nOur dogs are well socialized, very friendly, well mannered, affectionate, and in wonderful health. While some might be timid or shy, we work with our adopters in any way we can, to help them to work with their new family member. We give training tips and behavioral tips and even board for a very reasonable fee. Our dogs are extremely well cared for - most even know how to use a dog door by the time they leave us, know basic commands, and are crate trained!  We stand by our pups/dogs, and give 10 days for a refund and almost always take our dogs back at any age of their lives (can sometimes depend on the dog)! \n\nLovable Mutts Adoption Center has an application screening process.  All applicants are asked to provide vet references, personal references, and a home visit.  We pride ourselves in matching up the right dog with the right home.  Sometimes this happens quickly and sometimes it might take awhile.  We hope you understand and are willing to wait for the perfect pup for your situation. We reserve the right to turn applicants down and to change our mind about a suitable match, for we are only concerned about what is best for our dogs.  Also note that we arrange our visiting hours around your schedule, as this is a private, in home facility.  We respond to all inquiries promptly, so if you have any trouble sending us an email, or have not heard back from us within 24 hours, please, CONTACT US AGAIN and check your spam!  (We all know how emails can be at times!)\n\nOur dogs are spayed or neutered (if old enough), up to date on vaccines, wormed, heartworm tested, and free of fleas and ticks.  We temperament test our  dogs and they are all suitable for many family situations. Our dogs are well mannered,  and are in our family/home situation at this time (not kept in kennels or crates), and are worked with daily.  All of our dogs do well with other dogs and many do well with cats, and we can cat test. Adoption donations vary with age, breed, vetting, and training of the dog, and range from $250 to $500. This donation helps to pay for shots, de-wormings, spays, neuters, flea protection, heartworm/Lyme testing, treatments, and other vetting/issues that might be needed, for dogs in our care.  (We do not tend to place puppies or small dogs with kids under 6 and reserve the right to match who WE feel would be the best homes for our dogs.)  \nPlease, come adopt one of our Lovable Mutts - you will be so glad you did!\n\n(IF YOU DO NOT GET A REPLY EMAIL WITHIN 24 HOURS, CHECK YOUR SPAM BOX - WE REPLY EVERY FEW HOURS TO EMAILS)",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Mimi came to us from our friends at the wonderful Rescue Network. She was one of about a dozen dogs removed from a rural property when the owner was found deceased. Our shelter took in four of them. Mimi appears to be a beagle mix of some kind but don't hold us to that. She is delightfully chunky and has a wonderful personality. Mimi is very shy to start but loves a good belly rub on her substantial tummy. She's obviously had puppies in the past. Mimi will need to be spayed and her fee is $125.\n\nThe good stuff: Mimi is a sweetheart and does appear to love people and attention. She keeps her kennel very clean at the shelter.\n\nThe not so good stuff: Mimi is a very shy dog. She has received little to no basic training. She had never experienced a collar or leash before rescue. She will need a lot of patience and training when it comes to this.\n\nWe do think that Mimi would be fine with other dogs but don't know about cats. She does require a securely fenced area.

She is working on her leash training and house training and doing very well.  She had blood work and dental done. \n\nLavender was out of time when FWFP stepped in. \n\nInterested in becoming a forever home for Lavender? Fill out our online adoption application: http://www.friendswithfourpaws.org/adoption-form.html This is the first step in our process, and we don't go any further without an application.\n\nFind more adoptable pets, news and information on Instagram @friendswithfourpaws or our Facebook page Friends with Four Paws .\n\nWe put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them and you.  Please do not submit an application if you are not serious about adopting Lavender.\nWe are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and Lavender the perfect forever home, and appreciate you working with us.  \nFor immediate consideration, please attach your application to the initial inquiry to help us expedite the process.\n\nOur adoption fee is $525. This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.\n\nAll of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements for transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home AFTER an application is being processed.\n\nThank you in advance for your patience with our process and for making adoption YOUR option!",

Note: The forms that Petfinder or Adopt-a-pet has to inquire about the dog is not our application application. Our form must be filled out to be approved to adopt a pet.***\n\nCovid-19 Precautions:\n\nUntil further notice, Bichon & Little Buddies will be doing all meets and adoptions by appointment only. To be able to control the number of people at the shelter at one time, we will be suspending our open hours on Thursdays. If interested in adopting, please fill out the pre-adoption application and we will set up a time for you to come meet the dogs you are interested in.\n\nAbout this Dog:\n\nName: Mystic\n\nBreed: Mixed - Possibly Golden Retriever or German Shepherd\n\nApproximate Age: 1 yr\n\nGender: Female\n\nWeight: 40 lb\n\nAdoption Fee: $400\n\nWhy in Rescue: Texas Transfer\n\nGeneral Profile: Please fill out the adoption application at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog if you are interested in meeting one of our dogs.\n\nMystic is a very sweet girl who came all the way from Texas in a snowstorm to find a wonderful home. Right now she seems to get a little overwhelmed if too many people are paying attention to her at the same time, and seems like she may prefer women to men - but she has been with us a very short time so she may get a little more relaxed with that as she adjusts to her new situation at the shelter. We do not have any other history or background, so do not know if she is housetrained or lived with other pets or with children. If interested in meeting Mystic, please fill out the preadoption application as that is the first step in adoption. If the dog is still listed on the adoptables pages, we are still taking applications.\n\nWe do our best to evaluate the dogs while they are with us, but they sometimes act different in the shelter environment than they do in a home. If you are interested in any of our dogs, please fill out the pre-adoption application and we will set up a time for you to come and meet them.\n\nIf considering adopting a former breeding dog, the following article is good to read to help you understand the special needs these dogs may have. http://www.nowisconsinpuppymills.com/mill-survivors.html\n\nAdoption Procedures:\n\n1. Completely fill out the pre-adoption application at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog. We will be checking with your vet if you have had pets, calling your landlord (if any) and checking a personal reference, before we contact you about visiting the adoptables. Any missing information may have us moving onto another application.\n\n2. If you application is approved, we will contact you to come meet the adoptables that you are interested in.\n\n3. If it is a match, you will complete the adoption contract and pay the adoption fee. Please be prepared to take your adopted pet home when you come meet him/her. In most cases, you will be able to take the pet home the same day. If all the vetting hasn't been done yet, we will hold the pet for you until the vet work is completed.\n\n4. If you have filled out an application and we haven't contacted you within a week, we may have missed your application, the pet may have been adopted by another applicant, or you may have been missing information on your application. You may contact us to find out the status of your application at this time. Please give us a week to process your application before contacting us!\n\nThe adoption fee through Bichon and Little Buddies Rescue is $200 - $475 depending on the age of the dog, which includes Wi State Sales Tax. Included in this fee is your new companion who will be spayed/neutered, have a current Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (as required by state law), current on age appropriate vaccinations, heartworm tested and started on preventative, microchipped, and dewormed. Other medical needs will also have been taken care of, such as dentals and treating ear infections.\n\nTo assist you and your new pet in adjusting to life together, you will also receive an 8 week age appropriate obedience training course at For Pet's Sake Dog Training for $50 (up to $200 value). You may opt to take Puppy Kindergarten, Adult Beginners, Small Dogs Big Hearts, or Shy & Reactive Dog Class. You must start the class within 90 days of adoption for the reduced fee. For more information on the classes visit www.forpetssake.cc\n\nAll dogs are seen BY APPOINTMENT ONLY. Many are in various foster homes getting extra one on one attention getting them ready for their new homes. The first step in adoption is filling out the pre-adoption application. Bichon and Little Buddies is run by volunteers who have full time jobs in addition to the hours they spend with the rescue dogs. Having an application on file assures us that the potential adopter is really interested in adopting a dog. It also assists us in placing dogs in homes where both the dog and new owners are happy. The application puts you under no obligation to adopt a dog from Bichon and Little Buddies.\n\nThe Dog Pre-Adoption Application can be found at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog\n\nThanks for thinking about adopting your new pet!More important information:\n\n***We are a Wisconsin based rescue and do not ship our pets. If you are considering adoption you must be willing to drive to meet and adopt the pet, as well as bring the pet back to us if the adoption doesn't work. We adopt primarily in WI and IL, but will consider applicants in MN, IA, and MI.***\n\n***Please do not set up an appointment to meet the animals until you are ready to take your pet home. If the meeting results in a match, you can often take the dog/cat home the same day or within a couple days if the medical care hasn't been completed. We are not able to hold pets for adopters beyond this time. Thanks for understanding.***\n\n***While we hope all of our adoptions lead to permanent homes for the animals we place, sometimes things just don't work out. We do have a 30 day trial period. For the first 30 days, if you or Bichon and Little Buddies decide that the adoption isn't a good match for either the humans or the pet, the adoption fee will be refunded minus $50 within 30 days of the return of the dog. Bichon and Little Buddies also requires adopters to return the pet to us at any time that they are unable or unwilling to care for the animal anymore.***\n\n***We do not show dogs/cats without an appointment. The first step in adoption is filling out the pre-adoption application at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog Please do not call/email until AFTER you have filled out an application.***\n\nBichon and Little Buddies is a State Licensed Rescue # 268555-DS",

These aren't bad things, it's just that growing up I never had a good experience with that so now I get kind of irritated.

They are still very scared but improving after their two weeks in their new foster home. \n\nAngel is Smoky's son. He is 3 years old and about 20lbs.\n\n\nInterested in becoming a forever home for Angel? Fill out our online adoption application: http://www.friendswithfourpaws.org/adoption-form.html This is the first step in our process, and we don't go any further without an application.\n\nFind more adoptable pets, news and information on Instagram @friendswithfourpaws or our Facebook page Friends with Four Paws .\n\nWe put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them and you.  Please do not submit an application if you are not serious about adopting Angel.\nWe are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and Angel the perfect forever home, and appreciate you working with us.  \nFor immediate consideration, please attach your application to the initial inquiry to help us expedite the process.\n\nOur adoption fee is includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.\n\nAll of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements for transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home AFTER an application is being processed.\n\nThank you in advance for your patience with our process and for making adoption YOUR option!",

He will roll over anytime for a belly rub.  He is a bit of a goofball that loves to throw his own toy and catch it and can self entertain!  But he loves playing with his foster sisters.  He is attentive, alert, crate trained, housetrained, loves car rides and loves going for walks!  He is about 62 pounds.  He looks much bigger because of all of his \"fluff\"...\n\nPlease email adoptions@petsandpeople.com directly for a faster response and we will send you our questionnaire.

He is very smart and would benefit from puppy classes. He is good with cats and he is house trained. An active family and a home with a yard would be great for Rosco.  No apartments for this guy. Children over 10 would be best due to his energy and his size. He would do best in a home where someone is home a good amount of the day.  He would not do well left alone for long periods of time. He is a sweet, happy pup.  Check him out.  You will fall in love.\n\nBreed: Shepherd mix\nSex: Neutered Male\nAge: 1 year\nSize: 70 lbs\nArrival Date: 1-9-21\n\nRosco is neutered, up to date on shots, heart worm tested negative and microchipped.\n\nIf you would like to meet Rosco, please contact ResQpaws at info@resqpaws.org or you can fill out an application on our website, resqpaws.org.

They are still very scared but improving after their two weeks in their new foster home. Smoky is the mama she is approximately 6 to 8 years and about 10 pounds.  She is a Schnauzer/Yorkie super mutt mix . \n\nInterested in becoming a forever home for Smoky? Fill out our online adoption application: http://www.friendswithfourpaws.org/adoption-form.html This is the first step in our process, and we don't go any further without an application.\n\nFind more adoptable pets, news and information on Instagram @friendswithfourpaws or our Facebook page Friends with Four Paws .\n\nWe put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them and you.  Please do not submit an application if you are not serious about adopting Smoky.\nWe are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and Smoky the perfect forever home, and appreciate you working with us.  \nFor immediate consideration, please attach your application to the initial inquiry to help us expedite the process.\n\nOur adoption fee includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.\n\nAll of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements for transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home AFTER an application is being processed.\n\nThank you in advance for your patience with our process and for making adoption YOUR option!",

She is a 7 yr old Red Tick Coon Hound looking for a forever home. She is move-in ready meaning housetrained and good with other dogs, cats, and kids. She does need to eat separately from everyone as she guards her food. She has a lot of energy and does need room to run and play but loves snuggles and lap time just as much. Fill out an adoption application if you would like to meet her!\n\nAdoption fees are $250 for puppies and $200 for dogs over 8 months. If you think you would be interested, please complete our no obligation application and we can start the process at www.middletennesseetreasures.com.\n\nOur dogs and cats are kept in foster homes with volunteers who share their homes with these animals until the right adoptive home is found. These foster homes evaluate for temperament and also work on basic training with the dogs. Our dogs and cats have been seen by a vet, brought up to date on vaccinations, micro-chipped, heartworm tested, cleared of parasites and spayed or neutered if 6 months or older. \n\nThe first step in adopting from Middle Tennessee Treasures is to complete an adoption application.(http://www.middletennesseetreasures.com/adoption/) Vet references are usually called first. When we contact your vet we ask about current and past pets (both dogs and cats). We ask if all animals are spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccinations, seen on a yearly basis and whether dogs are on heartworm preventative. Personal references are called and finally a home visit is set up. The purpose of the home visit to meet you, your family, and any pets you may have. It also allows us to see what kind of dog or cat would be the best fit for your home. \n\nThis screening process helps to ensure that each rescued dog is placed in a loving, safe, and permanent home. We do not place our dogs on a first come, first serve basis, but according to the needs of the dog and family.",

I am a lab mix girl about 28# s. I do not think I will grow much more. I love to romp and play with toys and other dogs. I am good with little dogs and ones my size too. Just so long as they want to play. I am completely house trained and use a doggy door well. I am either microchipped or can be with a voucher.\n\nBinkki can be seen at our adoption events on the 2nd and 4th Saturday of the month at Jake's Feed Store in Longview, Texas or by appointment to approved applicants. For more information, please visit http://FurrEverPetsRescue.org, text this number for my foster mom 903 243-2758,  or call (9 a.m.-8 p.m.)/text Ione Fried, (903) 918-3213.

You can throw tennis balls for Sire all day and he will love you forever! This is a very happy boy with good energy - he likes to be active and prefers to be outside playing. He is a quick learner and enjoys a routine but, he can be stubborn from time to time. His head tilt and sad blue \"puppy\" dog eyes will get you every time, if you let them. Did we mention, he LOVES to chase tennis balls??? Besides fetching tennis balls, Sire loves his treats, will sit on command, walks good on a leash, does good around dogs and children. He may need work on house training, cats are unknown, and he should have enough room to run and play. Sire will make a wonderful family pet and is available for adoption through Eleventh Hour Rescue.\n\nApply to adopt SIRE LONESTAR at EHRdogs.org!",

            "description": "Scroll down to learn more about this pet:\n\n***\nBichon and Little Buddies is open only\n\nby appointment with a completed application.\nDogs in foster homes require an appointment and approved application to meet. The application is online at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog If a dog is listed as available, then we are still taking applications - no need to email or call to ask about the status. Note: The forms that Petfinder or Adopt-a-pet has to inquire about the dog is not our application application. Our form must be filled out to be approved to adopt a pet.***\n\nCovid-19 Precautions:\n\nUntil further notice, Bichon & Little Buddies will be doing all meets and adoptions by appointment only. To be able to control the number of people at the shelter at one time, we will be suspending our open hours on Thursdays. If interested in adopting, please fill out the pre-adoption application and we will set up a time for you to come meet the dogs you are interested in.\n\nAbout this Dog:\n\nName: Taz\n\nBreed: Chihuahua (or mix)\n\nApproximate Age: 2 yr\n\nGender: Male\n\nWeight: 12 lb\n\nAdoption Fee: $400\n\nWhy in Rescue: Texas Transfer\n\nGeneral Profile: Please fill out the adoption application at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog if you are interested in meeting one of our dogs.\n\nTaz came to us all the way from Texas in a snowstorm because he wanted to find a loving home. He was found as a stray in Texas with all his canine teeth filed or wore down. He is a friendly guy and we were told he was good with other dogs. We do not have any other history or background, so do not know if he is housetrained or lived with other pets or with children. If interested in meeting Taz, please fill out the preadoption application as that is the first step in adoption. If the dog is still listed on the adoptables pages, we are still taking applications.\n\nWe do our best to evaluate the dogs while they are with us, but they sometimes act different in the shelter environment than they do in a home. If you are interested in any of our dogs, please fill out the pre-adoption application and we will set up a time for you to come and meet them.\n\nIf considering adopting a former breeding dog, the following article is good to read to help you understand the special needs these dogs may have. http://www.nowisconsinpuppymills.com/mill-survivors.html\n\nAdoption Procedures:\n\n1. Completely fill out the pre-adoption application at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog. We will be checking with your vet if you have had pets, calling your landlord (if any) and checking a personal reference, before we contact you about visiting the adoptables. Any missing information may have us moving onto another application.\n\n2. If you application is approved, we will contact you to come meet the adoptables that you are interested in.\n\n3. If it is a match, you will complete the adoption contract and pay the adoption fee. Please be prepared to take your adopted pet home when you come meet him/her. In most cases, you will be able to take the pet home the same day. If all the vetting hasn't been done yet, we will hold the pet for you until the vet work is completed.\n\n4. If you have filled out an application and we haven't contacted you within a week, we may have missed your application, the pet may have been adopted by another applicant, or you may have been missing information on your application. You may contact us to find out the status of your application at this time. Please give us a week to process your application before contacting us!\n\nThe adoption fee through Bichon and Little Buddies Rescue is $200 - $475 depending on the age of the dog, which includes Wi State Sales Tax. Included in this fee is your new companion who will be spayed/neutered, have a current Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (as required by state law), current on age appropriate vaccinations, heartworm tested and started on preventative, microchipped, and dewormed. Other medical needs will also have been taken care of, such as dentals and treating ear infections.\n\nTo assist you and your new pet in adjusting to life together, you will also receive an 8 week age appropriate obedience training course at For Pet's Sake Dog Training for $50 (up to $200 value). You may opt to take Puppy Kindergarten, Adult Beginners, Small Dogs Big Hearts, or Shy & Reactive Dog Class. You must start the class within 90 days of adoption for the reduced fee. For more information on the classes visit www.forpetssake.cc\n\nAll dogs are seen BY APPOINTMENT ONLY. Many are in various foster homes getting extra one on one attention getting them ready for their new homes. The first step in adoption is filling out the pre-adoption application. Bichon and Little Buddies is run by volunteers who have full time jobs in addition to the hours they spend with the rescue dogs. Having an application on file assures us that the potential adopter is really interested in adopting a dog. It also assists us in placing dogs in homes where both the dog and new owners are happy. The application puts you under no obligation to adopt a dog from Bichon and Little Buddies.\n\nThe Dog Pre-Adoption Application can be found at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog\n\nThanks for thinking about adopting your new pet!More important information:\n\n***We are a Wisconsin based rescue and do not ship our pets. If you are considering adoption you must be willing to drive to meet and adopt the pet, as well as bring the pet back to us if the adoption doesn't work. We adopt primarily in WI and IL, but will consider applicants in MN, IA, and MI.***\n\n***Please do not set up an appointment to meet the animals until you are ready to take your pet home. If the meeting results in a match, you can often take the dog/cat home the same day or within a couple days if the medical care hasn't been completed. We are not able to hold pets for adopters beyond this time. Thanks for understanding.***\n\n***While we hope all of our adoptions lead to permanent homes for the animals we place, sometimes things just don't work out. We do have a 30 day trial period. For the first 30 days, if you or Bichon and Little Buddies decide that the adoption isn't a good match for either the humans or the pet, the adoption fee will be refunded minus $50 within 30 days of the return of the dog. Bichon and Little Buddies also requires adopters to return the pet to us at any time that they are unable or unwilling to care for the animal anymore.***\n\n***We do not show dogs/cats without an appointment. The first step in adoption is filling out the pre-adoption application at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog Please do not call/email until AFTER you have filled out an application.***\n\nBichon and Little Buddies is a State Licensed Rescue # 268555-DS",

            "description": "Scroll down to learn more about this pet:\n\n***\nBichon and Little Buddies is open only\n\nby appointment with a completed application.\nDogs in foster homes require an appointment and approved application to meet. The application is online at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog If a dog is listed as available, then we are still taking applications - no need to email or call to ask about the status. Note: The forms that Petfinder or Adopt-a-pet has to inquire about the dog is not our application application. Our form must be filled out to be approved to adopt a pet.***\n\nCovid-19 Precautions:\n\nUntil further notice, Bichon & Little Buddies will be doing all meets and adoptions by appointment only. To be able to control the number of people at the shelter at one time, we will be suspending our open hours on Thursdays. If interested in adopting, please fill out the pre-adoption application and we will set up a time for you to come meet the dogs you are interested in.\n\nAbout this Dog:\n\nName: Mr Weinerschnitzel\n\nBreed: Dachshund (or mix)\n\nApproximate Age: 2 yr\n\nGender: Male\n\nWeight: 15 lb\n\nAdoption Fee: $400\n\nWhy in Rescue: Texas Transfer\n\nGeneral Profile: Please fill out the adoption application at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog if you are interested in meeting one of our dogs.\n\nMr Weinerschnitzel came to us all the way from Texas in a snowstorm because he wanted to find a loving home. Mr W is a happy and friendly guy. He has the Dachshund look with longer legs so he is most likely a Dachshund mix. We do not have any other history or background, so do not know if he is housetrained or lived with other pets or with children. If interested in meeting Mr Weinerschnitzel, please fill out the preadoption application as that is the first step in adoption. If the dog is still listed on the adoptables pages, we are still taking applications.\n\nWe do our best to evaluate the dogs while they are with us, but they sometimes act different in the shelter environment than they do in a home. If you are interested in any of our dogs, please fill out the pre-adoption application and we will set up a time for you to come and meet them.\n\nIf considering adopting a former breeding dog, the following article is good to read to help you understand the special needs these dogs may have. http://www.nowisconsinpuppymills.com/mill-survivors.html\n\nAdoption Procedures:\n\n1. Completely fill out the pre-adoption application at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog. We will be checking with your vet if you have had pets, calling your landlord (if any) and checking a personal reference, before we contact you about visiting the adoptables. Any missing information may have us moving onto another application.\n\n2. If you application is approved, we will contact you to come meet the adoptables that you are interested in.\n\n3. If it is a match, you will complete the adoption contract and pay the adoption fee. Please be prepared to take your adopted pet home when you come meet him/her. In most cases, you will be able to take the pet home the same day. If all the vetting hasn't been done yet, we will hold the pet for you until the vet work is completed.\n\n4. If you have filled out an application and we haven't contacted you within a week, we may have missed your application, the pet may have been adopted by another applicant, or you may have been missing information on your application. You may contact us to find out the status of your application at this time. Please give us a week to process your application before contacting us!\n\nThe adoption fee through Bichon and Little Buddies Rescue is $200 - $475 depending on the age of the dog, which includes Wi State Sales Tax. Included in this fee is your new companion who will be spayed/neutered, have a current Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (as required by state law), current on age appropriate vaccinations, heartworm tested and started on preventative, microchipped, and dewormed. Other medical needs will also have been taken care of, such as dentals and treating ear infections.\n\nTo assist you and your new pet in adjusting to life together, you will also receive an 8 week age appropriate obedience training course at For Pet's Sake Dog Training for $50 (up to $200 value). You may opt to take Puppy Kindergarten, Adult Beginners, Small Dogs Big Hearts, or Shy & Reactive Dog Class. You must start the class within 90 days of adoption for the reduced fee. For more information on the classes visit www.forpetssake.cc\n\nAll dogs are seen BY APPOINTMENT ONLY. Many are in various foster homes getting extra one on one attention getting them ready for their new homes. The first step in adoption is filling out the pre-adoption application. Bichon and Little Buddies is run by volunteers who have full time jobs in addition to the hours they spend with the rescue dogs. Having an application on file assures us that the potential adopter is really interested in adopting a dog. It also assists us in placing dogs in homes where both the dog and new owners are happy. The application puts you under no obligation to adopt a dog from Bichon and Little Buddies.\n\nThe Dog Pre-Adoption Application can be found at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog\n\nThanks for thinking about adopting your new pet!More important information:\n\n***We are a Wisconsin based rescue and do not ship our pets. If you are considering adoption you must be willing to drive to meet and adopt the pet, as well as bring the pet back to us if the adoption doesn't work. We adopt primarily in WI and IL, but will consider applicants in MN, IA, and MI.***\n\n***Please do not set up an appointment to meet the animals until you are ready to take your pet home. If the meeting results in a match, you can often take the dog/cat home the same day or within a couple days if the medical care hasn't been completed. We are not able to hold pets for adopters beyond this time. Thanks for understanding.***\n\n***While we hope all of our adoptions lead to permanent homes for the animals we place, sometimes things just don't work out. We do have a 30 day trial period. For the first 30 days, if you or Bichon and Little Buddies decide that the adoption isn't a good match for either the humans or the pet, the adoption fee will be refunded minus $50 within 30 days of the return of the dog. Bichon and Little Buddies also requires adopters to return the pet to us at any time that they are unable or unwilling to care for the animal anymore.***\n\n***We do not show dogs/cats without an appointment. The first step in adoption is filling out the pre-adoption application at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog Please do not call/email until AFTER you have filled out an application.***\n\nBichon and Little Buddies is a State Licensed Rescue # 268555-DS",

She is a double merle Aussie, and is the funniest little thing!\nShe is blind in one eye, and we thought she was deaf, but it seems she may have partial hearing. Her special needs does not slow her down even a tad, she is super playful, bouncy, and get's around really well! She is fearless, and loves people. We do not think anything will hold her back from living a normal dog life, of course, with just a little bit more help. But not much! She is going to make someone such a special companion, with ton's of fun and laughter. \n\nShe is currently working on crate training and doing excellent. She sleeps soundly, and rarely rarely has an accident in her crate. She loves to tug on the bottom of your pants, and be such a little goofball. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting Blossum, please head to our website FIRST to fill out an application. We will also be asking for photo's of home, to ensure Blossums safety, so have that ready to send over also. \n\nPearl is too young to be spayed, so adopters will sign a contract stating that it's their responsibly to get it done after the dog turns 6 months old, but before 1 years old.\n\nShe is located in Tehachapi, CA. \nBut can be transported for an additional fee, if needed.",

All my siblings have found their furever homes so now it's my turn. I'm learning how to use puppy pads, and to walk on leash to do my business outside. I sleep in a crate at night and enjoy the company of other small gentle dogs. I'm only 5 months old now and will be a small dog when I'm full grown, so no small children please. My adoption includes free obedience training to get us started on the right (or left) paw!\nVisit floridahumanesociety.org or call 954-974-6152 ext. 404 for more information. Leave a message and it will be returned as soon as possible. All canines are spayed/neutered, up to date on their shots and microchipped. Potential adopters should all live in Broward or Palm Beach counties.",

Haley is always grinning, cheek to cheek! She is so full of love and knows she can shower her humans with lots of kisses! Haley loves to play and often gets the zoomies. But she is also never opposed to a nice cuddle session, belly rubs included of course! Haley will follow you around all day and when it is time to relax, she will happily lay at your feet. She is a 50-pound love who just truly enjoys the company of her humans. She is also extremely smart and already knows sit, shake, lie down, speak, and sit pretty! Haley may welcome calmer, medium to large dog siblings (pending a meet), and no cats or small animals. Haley is house broken and would welcome children of all ages. Could you hold the key to Haley's heart?! \n\nAll of our dogs and puppies are spayed/neutered prior to being placed for adoption. They also receive a physical examination from our veterinarian and are tested for heartworm. All of our dogs receive age-appropriate vaccinations (including rabies) and they are treated for fleas. All cats and dogs adopted from our facility are microchipped. \n\nFor more information, please call (440) 951-6122, email adopt@lakehumane.org or visit our website at www.lakehumane.org.

            "description": "Meet Boss! Boss is a 2 year old, American Bulldog and Staffordshire Terrier mix. Boss is a hunk. He is a little over 70 lbs and all muscle. With that being said, he is also the sweetest soul. He is dog friendly but is dominant so will need a more submissive dog (and more dogs his size) in the home and we will require a meet and greet. We will say no to cats, although he doesn't immediately go after them he seems to have some interest in them. Boss is going to make someone a great companion as he is so smart and his mannerisms are exquisite. Boss is updated on vaccines, dewormer, has his rabies shot and is scheduled for neuter surgery. He will also be microchipped. $125 to adopt. - Interested? Apply online! http://www.hshcwv.org/wanting-to-adopt.html If you don't apply for this guy you are missing out!",

We are unsure of her mix -- but she looks very much like an Australian Shepherd or Border Collie. She is playful and loves to wrestle with his siblings. She will need housetraining and someone around much of the day for his socialization, training, and development. A fenced yard is required. No apartments. No children under the age of 7 years old due to sharp puppy teeth.\n\nJosie's adoption fee of $400.00 includes a vet exam, current vaccinations, heartworm & fecal tests, monthly heartworm prevention, flea treatment, spay, and microchip.\n\nIf you live in the Austin area and are interested in adopting, please go to www.ForgottenFriendsTX.org and fill out an application. \n\nPlease be aware that we rarely have information on our dogs being good with cats as most of our foster homes don't have them. \n\nAdoption decisions are based on the best overall match and not done on a first-come-first-serve basis.",

They are a Beagle (hound type) mix. Very sweet, loving puppies. We do not expect them to be over 50lbs. Beagle's are known for their independent nature, always using their noses, can be difficult to train in some aspects, and can be rather noisey. Please do your research before applying. Although, a more difficult breed, they are very loving with their families, get along well with other animals, food driven, and be goofballs! \n\nIf you interesting in adopting the FIRST step is to head to our website and fill out an application. Please be aware that we will ask for photos of your home, where the dog being adopt will spend most it's time, and have these ready to send, if approved. \n\nThese puppies are too young to be spayed/nuetered and will go to their homes on a contract stating they must have the surgery done after 6 months old, but before 1 years old.",

They are a Beagle (hound type) mix. Very sweet, loving puppies. We do not expect them to be over 50lbs. Beagle's are known for their independent nature, always using their noses, can be difficult to train in some aspects, and can be rather noisey. Please do your research before applying. Although, a more difficult breed, they are very loving with their families, get along well with other animals, food driven, and be goofballs! \n\nIf you interesting in adopting the FIRST step is to head to our website and fill out an application. Please be aware that we will ask for photos of your home, where the dog being adopt will spend most it's time, and have these ready to send, if approved. \n\nThese puppies are too young to be spayed/nuetered and will go to their homes on a contract stating they must have the surgery done after 6 months old, but before 1 years old.",

And we can attest that she is one lovable teddy bear! Bear wants nothing more than a family to love and a warm fire place to snuggle up by. Bear came in with and old hind leg fracture that could not be repaired, and therefore it did need amputated. She has been recovering in a foster home and is now getting used to her new way of life, and ready to take the next step...finding a forever home! \n\nBear has a gentle and kind demeanor, and she loves every human she meets. She would prefer to be the only animal in the home to assure she never misses out on getting love and cuddles. Bear is a strong girl who is conquering the challenge of being on 3-legs, and she is doing great. Although, she may do best in a home with limited stairs and challenges around the house. Could you be the one to give Bear the home she truly deserves?! \n\nAll of our dogs and puppies are spayed/neutered prior to being placed for adoption. They also receive a physical examination from our veterinarian and are tested for heartworm. All of our dogs receive age-appropriate vaccinations (including rabies) and they are treated for fleas. All cats and dogs adopted from our facility are microchipped. \n\nFor more information, please call (440) 951-6122, email adopt@lakehumane.org or visit our website at www.lakehumane.org. Thank you for choosing adoption!",

We are unsure of his mix -- but he looks very much like an Australian Shepherd or Border Collie. He is playful and loves to wrestle with his siblings. He will need housetraining and someone around much of the day for his socialization, training, and development. A fenced yard is required. No apartments. No children under the age of 7 years old due to sharp puppy teeth.\n\nJordy's adoption fee of $400.00 includes a vet exam, current vaccinations, heartworm & fecal tests, monthly heartworm prevention, flea treatment, neuter and microchip.\n\nIf you live in the Austin area and are interested in adopting, please go to www.ForgottenFriendsTX.org and fill out an application. \n\nPlease be aware that we rarely have information on our dogs being good with cats as most of our foster homes don't have them. \n\nAdoption decisions are based on the best overall match and not done on a first-come-first-serve basis.",

They are a Beagle (hound type) mix. Very sweet, loving puppies. We do not expect them to be over 50lbs. Beagle's are known for their independent nature, always using their noses, can be difficult to train in some aspects, and can be rather noisey. Please do your research before applying. Although, a more difficult breed, they are very loving with their families, get along well with other animals, food driven, and be goofballs! \n\nIf you interesting in adopting the FIRST step is to head to our website and fill out an application. Please be aware that we will ask for photos of your home, where the dog being adopt will spend most it's time, and have these ready to send, if approved. \n\nThese puppies are too young to be spayed/nuetered and will go to their homes on a contract stating they must have the surgery done after 6 months old, but before 1 years old.",

They will be ready to go home with their new families 2/21, when they turn 8 weeks old!\n\nNOTE.... this is a 15 year commitment, so do not take this lightly!! The puppies are Siberian Husky / German Shepherd mixes. To be eligible to adopt, you must have breed experience with at least one of these breeds. Their adoption area is within driving distance to our vet in Davidsonville, MD, where they will be spayed and neutered late June.... NO EXCEPTIONS!!\n\nThey need homes who have other young, playful dogs and families who will not leave them for long periods of time. No small animals, small children or apartments. Remember, puppies are susceptible to disease, until they are fully vaccinated at 4 months of age. You must have a plan to keep them safe until they're fully vaccinated. If you are interested and can provide the type of home they need, you can apply on our website. We will not respond to your application if you do not meet the criteria above. We will be matching puppies to families based on their personality.\n\nwww.huskyrescueteam.org\n\n~~Husky Education And Rescue Team is a foster based rescue. Our dogs are in our foster homes all up and down the east coast. We do not have a facility in which you can visit. We find this a huge benefit because we learn our dogs and are able to educate our adopters on what it's like to have them live in your home. Part of our process, once pre-approved, is to speak with the foster for the dog you're interested in. If you're still interested in adopting from our rescue the first step is to complete our adoption application online at www.huskyrescueteam.org/apply\n\nIf you have additional questions please email info@huskyrescueteam.org",

They will be ready to go home with their new families 2/21, when they turn 8 weeks old!\n\nNOTE.... this is a 15 year commitment, so do not take this lightly!! The puppies are Siberian Husky / German Shepherd mixes. To be eligible to adopt, you must have breed experience with at least one of these breeds. Their adoption area is within driving distance to our vet in Davidsonville, MD, where they will be spayed and neutered late June.... NO EXCEPTIONS!!\n\nThey need homes who have other young, playful dogs and families who will not leave them for long periods of time. No small animals, small children or apartments. Remember, puppies are susceptible to disease, until they are fully vaccinated at 4 months of age. You must have a plan to keep them safe until they're fully vaccinated. If you are interested and can provide the type of home they need, you can apply on our website. We will not respond to your application if you do not meet the criteria above. We will be matching puppies to families based on their personality.\n\nwww.huskyrescueteam.org\n\n~~Husky Education And Rescue Team is a foster based rescue. Our dogs are in our foster homes all up and down the east coast. We do not have a facility in which you can visit. We find this a huge benefit because we learn our dogs and are able to educate our adopters on what it's like to have them live in your home. Part of our process, once pre-approved, is to speak with the foster for the dog you're interested in. If you're still interested in adopting from our rescue the first step is to complete our adoption application online at www.huskyrescueteam.org/apply\n\nIf you have additional questions please email info@huskyrescueteam.org",

I like to play with other small dogs, like myself, and I think that I could be very happy entering a family with younger children. I'd be a great pick for a first-time adopter and because of my small size and energy level, I could be the perfect apartment dog. Either a busy or a quiet lifestyle would be fine by me, as long as you still get plenty of visitors for me to meet and greet! I may even be the type of pup that you can bring with you out and about as you go on your daily adventures. I could use some additional training, particularly as it pertains to potty-training, but I know with some attention, I'll catch on to things very quickly!",

I am a beautiful, big brindle boy and I am totally a lover, despite being hurt by humans early in my life. I came in with a pretty bad burn on my back, but the wonderful people here on the ranch have been treating me and things are healing just fine. I would prefer to be the king of the castle in my new home and not reside with any other dogs. I don't usually like to play with other dogs and it's not uncommon to find me off by myself, as I seem to enjoy my space from time to time. I think I'd be happiest in a home that has a great big yard for me to run around and play in, when I want to. I could use a little bit of work on my manners, but I'm definitely worth it. I do seem to have mostly mastered potty-training, and I love to go on long-leashed walks with anyone who will take me. I was living in a foster home with lots of other dogs and we all got along just fine! I am not a huge fan of cats so living in a feline-free home would be preferably. I think I would also do best in an adult-only home, since I can be a little bit mouthy and tend to jump when I'm excited.",

They are a Beagle (hound type) mix. Very sweet, loving puppies. We do not expect them to be over 50lbs. Beagle's are known for their independent nature, always using their noses, can be difficult to train in some aspects, and can be rather noisey. Please do your research before applying. Although, a more difficult breed, they are very loving with their families, get along well with other animals, food driven, and be goofballs! \n\nIf you interesting in adopting the FIRST step is to head to our website and fill out an application. Please be aware that we will ask for photos of your home, where the dog being adopt will spend most it's time, and have these ready to send, if approved. \n\nThese puppies are too young to be spayed/nuetered and will go to their homes on a contract stating they must have the surgery done after 6 months old, but before 1 years old.",

They are a Beagle (hound type) mix. Very sweet, loving puppies. We do not expect them to be over 50lbs. Beagle's are known for their independent nature, always using their noses, can be difficult to train in some aspects, and can be rather noisey. Please do your research before applying. Although, a more difficult breed, they are very loving with their families, get along well with other animals, food driven, and be goofballs! \n\nIf you interesting in adopting the FIRST step is to head to our website and fill out an application. Please be aware that we will ask for photos of your home, where the dog being adopt will spend most it's time, and have these ready to send, if approved. \n\nThese puppies are too young to be spayed/nuetered and will go to their homes on a contract stating they must have the surgery done after 6 months old, but before 1 years old.",

We are unsure of his mix -- but he looks very much like a Labrador. He has a beautiful reddish-brown coat with brown eyes. He is a little shy initially, but playful and loves to wrestle with his siblings. He will need housetraining and someone around much of the day for his socialization, training, and development. A fenced yard is required. No apartments. No children under the age of 7 years old due to sharp puppy teeth.\n\nJesse's adoption fee of $400.00 includes a vet exam, current vaccinations, heartworm & fecal tests, monthly heartworm prevention, flea treatment, neuter and microchip.\n\nIf you live in the Austin area and are interested in adopting, please go to www.ForgottenFriendsTX.org and fill out an application. \n\nPlease be aware that we rarely have information on our dogs being good with cats as most of our foster homes don't have them. \n\nAdoption decisions are based on the best overall match and not done on a first-come-first-serve basis.",

            "description": "Hi and thank you for your interest in adopting from The Foster Farm!\n\nCOVID-19 UPDATE: Due to the overwhelming amount of applications, calls, and emails regarding our currently available pets, we cannot respond to everyone at this time. We appreciate your enthusiasm to rescue a new family member, but please be aware that we simply do not have enough pets in foster care to meet demands at this time. \n\nWE ARE NOT DOING OUT-OF-STATE ADOPTIONS AT THIS TIME.\n\nIn order to help us process your application, please include as much detail and information as possible. Our adoption process is not first come first serve - we work extremely hard to meet the needs of every pet individually, and we do not base our matches on appearances (color, coat length, etc.). \n\nIf you're inquiring about our adoption process, please visit thefosterfarm.org/adopt for information, policies, and procedures. \n\nIf you have submitted an application at thefosterfarm.org/adopt and received the confirmation email from Cognito Forms (your receipt will appear as a copy of the application you submitted), we are reviewing your application. If you are approved to adopt, you will receive an email approval within 72 business hours (Monday through Friday only)! Because our organization is run entirely by four volunteers each with full-time jobs, families, personal pets, and foster animals, we are only able to reach out to approved applicants. \n\nThank you so much for your patience and understanding as we all navigate these exceptional circumstances together!\n\nStay healthy and safe!\nThe Foster Farm Team",

We are unsure of his mix -- but he looks very much like a Labrador. He is playful and loves to wrestle with his siblings. He will need housetraining and someone around much of the day for his socialization, training, and development. A fenced yard is required. No apartments. No children under the age of 7 years old due to sharp puppy teeth.\n\nJax's adoption fee of $400.00 includes a vet exam, current vaccinations, heartworm & fecal tests, monthly heartworm prevention, flea treatment, neuter and microchip.\n\nIf you live in the Austin area and are interested in adopting, please go to www.ForgottenFriendsTX.org and fill out an application. \n\nPlease be aware that we rarely have information on our dogs being good with cats as most of our foster homes don't have them. \n\nAdoption decisions are based on the best overall match and not done on a first-come-first-serve basis.",

She gets along fine with other dogs and pays no attention to the cat in her foster home. She's very friendly and will make a nice companion for some lucky person or people.\n\nAbigayle is a Dachshund mix gal who is 6-7 years old and weighs 13 pounds.\n\nAbi is quite the athlete! She can climb wire crates and chain link fencing, so she should be walked on a leash (although she could use more work on leash walking) unless her new home has a wooden fence which she can't climb. She has progressed pretty well with pottying outside as long as she knows what is expected of her. She does fine in a crate but prefers to not be crated.\n\nIf you are interested in making this gal your new BFF, please fill out an application at www.northstarpets.org & be sure to ask for ABIGAYLE TX!",

It is all healed up now but as you can see I have an adorable crooked smile, but I don't mind! I can be a little shy at first but I truly love people and am definitely a velcro baby!! I also love kids, other dogs, and I like cats too... although I don't think the one I live with currently likes me much so I hide when he's mad. \n\nI love my people so much I just follow my foster mom around everywhere. If I could live in someones lap all day every day I would be so happy!!! I am very eager to please. All I want is to make my humans happy! I can be nervous in new situations but I just look at my foster mom. If she says it's okay then I trust her and get more comfortable!\n\nI know my name, have a great off leash recall, I also walk great on a leash and am very gentle and calm. I also know sit, wait, leave it, up ( to stand on my hind legs), load up, and go (to chase the tennis ball). We also have been working on my general anxiety and crate training. At first I was so scared of those crates but I have a come a long way now!!\n\nI would love to meet you if you think I would be a good fit for you and your family!! If you would like to meet me in real life please fill out an application!!",

Pictures and updates are posted there first.  \n\n5. All of our rescue dogs have the following\n\nSpay or neuter certificates\n\nvaccination records including Rabies\n\nAre on a monthly flea and heartworm preventive. \n\nCrate leash and house trained. \n\nGet along with other dogs ( otherwise indicated )\n\nEnjoy the company of school-age children who are respectful to them \n\nMost of them enjoy the company of cats as well, HOWEVER, in the past, we have found out that for some reason that is not always the case.  \n\nWe work VERY hard making sure our dogs acclimate to their new homes.  We seek adopters whose current pets are current on vaccinations and are altered. {\n\nPLEASE do not fill out an application if your pets are not. You will be denied.\n\n\nApplications can be found by going to our website  www.laurashoperescue.com\n\n",

He is learning sit, kennel/crate trained and is doing very well at being housetrained. \n\nHe\u2019s a very happy boy that just wants to please. He is 63 pounds of love and wags \n\nDuke was out of time when FWFP stepped in. \n\nInterested in becoming a forever home for Duke? Fill out our online adoption application: http://www.friendswithfourpaws.org/adoption-form.html This is the first step in our process, and we don't go any further without an application.\n\nFind more adoptable pets, news and information on Instagram @friendswithfourpaws or our Facebook page Friends with Four Paws .\n\nWe put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them and you.  Please do not submit an application if you are not serious about adopting Duke.\nWe are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and Duke the perfect forever home, and appreciate you working with us.  \nFor immediate consideration, please attach your application to the initial inquiry to help us expedite the process.\n\nOur adoption fee is $525. This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.\n\nAll of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements for transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home AFTER an application is being processed.\n\nThank you in advance for your patience with our process and for making adoption YOUR option!",

They brought me in and gave me a big clean dog run, a huge bowl of food, and a nice comfy bed.   I was never claimed by my family and now I am up for adoption. I have all of my vaccinations, I have a microchip, and I have been spayed.  One little problem did show up on my health check up.  I am heartworm positive. Whoever adopts me will need to have me treated. If you would like to donate to my treatment that would be soooo helpful! If you would like to foster me  through treatment and then adopt me\u2026.well that would be amazing!! Come in and visit with me!",

            "description": "Meet  Poppie! Poppie is around 1-2 year old female Chihuahua/Terrier mix.  She is very very sweet girl, gets along with all the other dogs and was fine with the cats at the vet. She is 10 pounds and has had blood work done. She is learning a leash and she\u2019s doing pretty well on house training.\n\n Poppie was out of time when FWFP stepped in. \n\nInterested in becoming a forever home for Poppie? Fill out our online adoption application: http://www.friendswithfourpaws.org/adoption-form.html This is the first step in our process, and we don't go any further without an application.\n\nFind more adoptable pets, news and information on Instagram @friendswithfourpaws or our Facebook page Friends with Four Paws .\n\nWe put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them and you.  Please do not submit an application if you are not serious about adopting Poppie.\nWe are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and Poppie the perfect forever home, and appreciate you working with us.  \nFor immediate consideration, please attach your application to the initial inquiry to help us expedite the process.\n\nOur adoption fee is $525. This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.\n\nAll of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements for transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home AFTER an application is being processed.\n\nThank you in advance for your patience with our process and for making adoption YOUR option!",

I was so tired of running from people, looking for food, and trying to stay safe on the streets.  While I have been here I have gotten all of my vaccinations, I am heartworm negative, I have a microchip, and I have been neutered.  If you are in the market for a nice small to medium size dog, well come by for a visit! I bet you would fall instantly in love with me!",

I walked around, checked out some yards, and tried to pretty much hide most of the time.  Fortunately, someone noticed my dilemma and stepped in to help me.  He picked me up and tried to find my owners.  He didn\u2019t have any luck so he thought the best thing he could do was bring me to the shelter to wait for my family.  He knew if I wasn\u2019t claimed, they would help me find a new home.  While I have been here I have gotten all of my vaccinations, I am heartworm negative, I got a microchip, and I have been spayed. I would like to say a big thank you to my rescuer that took the time to pick up a lost dog and bring me to the shelter!",

It made me sad to see them leave, but I am picking myself up and moving on.  The shelter is helping me get ready to meet my new family! They gave me all of my vaccinations, I am heartworm negative, I have a microchip, and I have been neutered.  IF you think you might like to adopt me go to our website at www.montgomeryhumane.com and fill out the adoption application and send it in online. Someone will contact you to set up an appointment to meet me!!",

She had a large abscess to the top of her head and her eye had trauma to it also.  Sadly it couldn't be saved and had to be removed.  Uno has proven to be a resilient pup and doesn't let her past slow her down.  She is a typical playful pup and adores her foster sister and the foster kids.  She will be a great fit for a family looking to adopt a pup!\n\nPrairie Pooches Rescue is a volunteer and foster based rescue.  All our dogs are in foster homes and approved adopters are required to meet the dogs at the foster homes. \n\nAdoption fee is $300.  All our dogs are spayed/neutered, vaccinations UTD, dewormed and microchipped.  Adoption applications and home visits are done for all adoptions.  Please fill out an application if interested on our website www.prairiepoochesrescue.com\n\n****Due to an overwhelming amount of emails and phone calls we receive we will only respond to ones that have an application attached.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.All of the animals posted on our site have been temperament tested. While not all are in the immediate area, once we have processed and approved your application, we will move the dog to our adoptive area for you to meet, greet and hopefully adopt. Sometimes we will have more than one application on a dog. That does not mean it automatically goes to another family but you should be aware of the fact that until you are approved and set up for the meet/greet.. the dog could get adopted by another applicant.This good boy wants a home more than you could ever imagine. And he is a GOOD boy, too. He is going to make a wonderful family dog/best friend. So young still that he is barely out of puppyhood. That makes him ready to learn what you want him to know. He is very smart, so if you show him what you want, he will do his very best to do it for you. He so much wants to be loved. His temperament is friendly and from his shepherd side he gets exceptional loyalty. He has never had a chance to give his heart away...you will be his first and his forever. He has had all his shots and been completely vetted. All he needs now is you. He is waiting patiently. Note from his foster: Tom is currently working with a trainer and the new adopter will need to continue with this after adoption. He is going to need a big backyard with a fence that is at least 6 ft high where he can run and play safely. A more rural area would be better for our boy, rather than urban. He is frightened of cars and trucks going by as he is walked. No children under the age of 12 in the home, since he can be a bit nippy and mouthy while playing. Tom is working hard with his trainer, so he will be ready for his forever home.\nIf you are interested in Tom, please fill out an application at:\nhttps://reachoutrescue.rescuegroups.org/forms/form?formid=4588 Or contact:\nrorrcanine@gmail.com\n*** Click here to sponsor this dog! ***",

            "description": "Miklo is a sweet old dude looking for a relaxed home to chill out in. He prefers to live an easy going lifestyle. Imagine sitting outside on your porch when the weather gets warm with this chill dude by your side. He'll be sure to make you smile everyday with his kind nature and sweet face. Miklo has lived with both cats and dogs before so he may be able to live with them again given the right amount of time to adjust to his new life. He has a few medical issues such as cataracts and benign masses. We will be happy to go over his full medical history with you at your appointment. \n\nThank you for your interest in our adoptable animals! Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we do require appointments to see our adoptable animals. Please complete the adoption application and a Customer Care Associate will be in contact with you. PLEASE NOTE: We ask that when you submit your application, that you are available to schedule an appointment within the next 24-48 hours.",

            "description": "Hi potential human! My name is Ollie and I am looking for a forever home. I am a very chill dog and if I could, I would be at my human's side 24/7. I love to lay around and I take A LOT of naps but in my forever home I would prefer to nap while cuddling because who doesn't want to cuddle? Even though cuddling is my number 1 priority I also love taking walks and smelling everything I come across. I like to play with my toys and am pretty good at fetch. Sometimes I trick my human and act like I'm going to bring the ball back but just run around with it instead. I like to play with other dogs but would need to meet your dog first to make sure we like each other! \n\n\n\nI have met 2 super cute little humans who were around 5 years old. I really liked them but sometimes their quick-moving toys scared me a little bit. Because I like to cuddle so much I don't like being away from my family. Whatever family adopts me will have to know that I get really sad when my people leave and they will have to work with me and teach me that they will always come back and that it is okay to be alone sometimes.\n\n\n\nIf you might be the family for me email foster@kcpetproject.org to meet me!",

            "description": "Are you a sucker for hound dog ears and puppy kisses? Look no further than Miller! This little chunk is a total goofball puppy with big paws and a big personality! He was born in December 2020 and is ready for his forever home. We aren\u2019t sure of his exact mix but expect him to be a large dog when full grown. \n\nPlease note: as with most rescue puppies, we have no way to guarantee this puppy\u2019s breed or size potential. \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for puppies covers initial deworming,  puppy vaccinations, microchip, and spay/neuter at the rescue's approved vet at 6 months of age. Please see our website for more information.  \n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq\n\n*Any breed labels used by Take Paws Rescue, its employees/volunteers, or on vet records provided cannot be guaranteed.  Breed labels are given based on information obtained during intake and/or best guesses based on appearance and/or temperament of the dogs and Take Paws Rescue gives no assurance to the accuracy of these labels. Labels are necessary for postings to many animal networking sites, such as Pet Finder, and are no way a guarantee. Additionally, exact age and potential size cannot be guaranteed.",

I don't pull on leash and stay right next to whoever is walking me.I scratch at the door or whine when I need to go potty, but otherwise I am content to lay on the couch and sleep most of the day.I am mostly quiet in the crate, but will cry if I need to go outside. I sleep through the night in a crate and won't wake you up.I love hot dogs and cheese!Sometimes I get bursts of energy and do jump up on people, but most of the time I'm calm.I am endearingly known as Garfield Dogbecause my personality is so similar to him.In a shelter setting, I have been noted to jump very high (approx 6-7ft)and escape an open top kennel,so I should not be left in a yard unattended and high fences are a plus. I have not tried to escape a yard while with my foster mom. I lived with children in my previous home and did well with them. I'd do well with other dogs with slow introductions.\n\nGeneral Socialization Notes:\n\n I am a bit shy, at first, but will warm up. I would do well in a home with another dog as long as we can do slow introductions. Some dogs can be intimidating to me. Sometimes in scary situations, I will growl and have snapped when I was scared.\n\nDoes Godiva like other pets?\n\n I have previously lived with cats, chickens and dogs. I was reported to do well withthe cats and chickens. I have chased squirrels and rabbitsoutside and that is usually the only time I pull on leash.I may not get along with all dogs as they intimidate me sometimes,but I have been doing well in my foster home with another medium sized dog. I alsoplayed well with one of the dogs from my previous home. Because I love food, I should be fed separately from other animals so we can all enjoy our meals in peace. A slow introduction to another dog would be best to set me up for the greatest success.\n\nDoes Godiva like children?\n\n I have previously lived with children from1 year old to14 years oldand did well with them and would often cuddle and sleep near them.\n\nFavorite Toys:\n\n Sometimes I will play fetch and I love to chew on bones. Overall, I'm not that interested in toys.\n\nIdeal Forever Home:\n\n My ideal forever home is someone that is home often to snuggle and take me on walks. I would love a nice bed or couch to cuddle on.A calm household that allows me to get as much sleep as I want is also a plus! I'd do okay with calmchildren and I could be an only dog or get along with another dog, as long as we can do slow introductions.",

I am 9 months old so I am very much still a puppy so I tend to jump on my people but I am learning not to slowly. I am house trained and crate trained. My foster mom says I amazingly smart so I will thrive with a family that is committed to training me to be the best dog I can be. She likes cats and needs to be with dog savvy kids older than 7 only because I am a jumper and can knock small ones over. Fill out an application for me at Foster Pet Outreach so we can do a meet and greet.\n\nOur adoption fee is $260 for dogs over 5 months of age and includes all vaccinations, spay/neuter, micro chip implantation and registration/transfer, heartworm test and much more. Puppies up to 5 months of age are $275 and this includes all sets of puppy vaccinations, spay/neuter, microchip implantation and registration and more. To adopt, go to www.fosterpetoutreach.org to complete an application.\nPlease note: Foster Pet Outreach tries to limit our adoptions to an area within approximately 60 miles of Peoria, Illinois.",

Everyone is rooting for him.  We are fostering him in our home currently and so know him extremely well.  The good news:  Zeus is a beautiful, loving, playful dog who is extremely loyal and devoted to \u201chis person\u201d.  He will follow you around and want to be wherever you are.  He loves to lie at your feet while you\u2019re on the computer or beside you while you\u2019re watching tv.  He\u2019s just dying to play sometimes and is really funny when he gets going.  He gets along with any dog we\u2019ve put him with (currently he living with four other dogs).  No problems at all.   He is great on walks in terms of ignoring other dogs and people and really just loves \u201csniffing\u201d along.  He does pull hard, but that could be trained.  He is about 43 pounds and is about 4 \u00bd years old.  He doesn\u2019t chew things up or destroy things.  Almost a perfect dog.  \nHowever, Zeus will need an experienced owner in a quiet household in order to become the dog he can be.  While almost perfect, he is very afraid of strangers (coming into the home \u2013 not on walks) and, at this point, will not warm to anyone for a couple of days.  He will bark at them and sound pretty scary.  He has never bitten anyone at all \u2013 just looks and sounds scary.  We are working on training him to accept strangers into his home, but this will be a process that needs to be continued.   \nSo, a beautiful terrific dog who needs just the right home.  If you are interested, please feel free to call us or email us to obtain other information and, perhaps, to meet him.\n",

These boys and their sister, who is spoken for, were rescued from poor living conditions and new to being inside. Everything is new, a little scary, and they need a special home. We are requiring another dog in the home to help teach them, and they are used to canine and feline company. We are asking for adults or teenage kids as they are shy, and ideally a fenced yard. They are not yet leash trained and are still learning the house training. Crates are used when alone. Casper and Bubba can be split up as long as the new home has another dog for them. They need a home with patience for a shy and scared dog, someone with a commitment. Please email Katie @ kladams4545@gmail.com to check availability, but be prepared to complete the adoption application on Homeward Bound Dog Rescue MN website, Dogs Available for Adoption as well.",

I had been found curled up against a tire in the Michigan winter snow. As soon as the staff brought me a little food, I gobbled it right up, trying to stand, but it was hard. Every time they would talk to me, I wagged my tail just as much as I could. They knew, \"This girl wants to live!\" So, they warmed me up, got some fluids in me, and found me a super wonderful foster mom with a dog to help me get out of the woods.\nI have been fostered for just over three weeks. I have doubled my weight in that time and am getting stronger everyday! My foster mom wants my new family to know, \"Stardust is a very sweet and spunky puppy full of energy and life. She is social and curious and loves to meet everyone, humans and animals alike. She would do best in a home with someone who is willing to spend the time teaching her manners, as she is still working on potty training and basic obedience.\"\n\nI am ready to live the best life a puppy can live with my furever family! As David Bowie once said, \"I don't know where I'm going from here, but I promise it won't be boring.\"",

He has not had the best life - he came from a hoarding situation and was just not treated very well by his previous owner. He will need a very patient, dog-savvy adopter willing to put the time in with treats and snuggles and walks to let him know that he is safe and loved. He is great with cats, and also is house trained (needs to have a schedule) and crate trained, though he does love sleeping in the bed with his foster momma. He is very skittish and scared of strangers and takes quite a while to open up and start trusting but once he does, he will be a great sidekick. This boy can't seem to shake his previous life completely and has a fear of men - A MUST-HAVE for him is a home with only women (or limited contact with men). For this reason, he also needs an ADULT-ONLY home with no children. He immediately finds his safe place (often a corner of the couch) until he feels more confident moving about the house and following his momma around. Zorro is starved for human touch and has learned to give high fives and nose kisses to ensure you keep petting him. He may be best as the only dog in the home, or only having a laid back, calm sibling who doesn't try to force playtime.\n\nIf you want to show this sweet boy that not all people are bad and give him the love that he deserves and learn more about him from his foster mom, please visit our website www.PoodleandPoochRescue.org where you will find the application to adopt. He is up to date on his vaccines, neutered, heartworm negative, and microchipped. His adoption donation is $250.",

I just joined the adoptable doggy crew at Providence Animal Center after traveling here from Florida, and I can\u2019t wait to move into my new forever home. My adoption day is all I can think about, so please don\u2019t make me wait too long!\n\nThe staff & volunteers are still getting to know me, but so far they've learned that I'm a friendly & playful girl who will bring a lot of fun to some lucky family!\n\nI'm all set to join my new forever home - already spayed, microchipped and up to date on vaccinations.  \n\nSo, if you have the love, time, and energy to devote to raising a young pup like me, come meet me in person by scheduling an appointment here: ProvidenceAC.org/AdoptADog to meet me in person. I'm all set to go, I just need a family to call my own! \n\nXOXO Reagan\"\n\n-------\nDuring your appointment, you will be able to meet a selection of pets in the Kennels or Cattery that day. New pets are arriving daily!\n-------\n\nProvidence Animal Center relies on adoption fees and donations to save pets! Adoption fees vary per pet. To find out this pet\u2019s adoption fee or for more information, please call the Adoption Center with this pet\u2019s ID number.\n\nCan\u2019t adopt? Consider fostering or donating! Visit https://providenceac.org/support-us/ for more information on how you can support the lifesaving mission!",

She does NOT like water (rain, puddles, beach...) but she will stand still outside to get a bath through the garden hoes.\n\nShe loves people and kids. She could possible knock over small children (1-4yrs) only due to her size. She if doesn't like a human, you shouldn't either.\n\nShe currently lives with other large dogs and she gets along wonderfully with 3 out of the 4.\n\nMOXIE CANNOT BE AROUND CATS! Or small dogs, rodents, birds ect. As she has a high prey drive. She will try to chase them outside, along with cars driving too fast, buses, garbage trucks and anything with a Diesel engine (she doesn't like the sound) so she needs a fenced in yard and adopter will need to be mindful of this when walking her should sh encounter this. She howls when she's excited or there are sirens and is not a fan of fireworks.\n\nThis good girl is crate trained and house trained. She has a crate with a Velcro cover that would go with her.",

THE ONLY THING HE NEEDS is a home where there are NO small children, and he can be the king of the house. He would prefer to be the only dog. NO cats. Hank also needs a home with a fenced in yard.\n\nHe is fully potty trained, crate trained, very obedient and loyal, and loves to snuggle and play. He is 8 years old, so just doesn't want a super busy household with kids jumping all over him.\n\nHank is vaccinated for rabies, distemper, and bordatella. Hank is neutered and is microchipped. Hank's adoption fee is $400 plus WI state tax. \n\nIf you are interested in meeting Hank, please fill out an application at luckypawsmidwest.org. Once your application is approved, we can set up a time for you to meet Hank!\n\nLucky Paws Midwest is licensed and inspected by the State of Wisconsin: 402655-DS",

He has clearly had a terrible life recently, for he is all bones, which has weakened him, but he is getting stronger daily and is more active and playful. He is also hw+ and is on slow-kill treatment, which means he stays on his once a month medicine, for several months to come, til he is hw free. He is good with people and dogs, and might love to be a second dog in a home. Prefer he not be with really young kids, for that might be too much for him, although he is very gentle. Reggie is so smart and so handsome in person. This 6 year old boy is skin and bones, and only weighs about 63 lbs right now - he should weight at least 80. We prefer a home with GSD experience and a fenced yard. Please, open your hearts and homes to this awesome boy, for you will be so glad you did. (Fostered in PA - We do not text) (If you do not hear back from us within about 6 hours, send us your phone number, for there is clearly something wrong with your email!) Dog's Best Friend Adoption Center utilizes an adoption application and screening process. We require personal and vet references and a home check made prior to adopting one of our dogs. All of our dogs are companion animals that must be kept inside the house with the rest of the family members. All of our dogs are temperament tested, well mannered, and know some basic commands ~ they are worked with daily, as someone is always here with them. All of our dogs do well with other dogs and many do well with cats. Adoption donations range from $250 to $450, depending on breed, age, size, vetting, and training of the dog (some pure bred and tiny dog fees are higher). This donation helps to pay for shots, de-wormings, spays, neuters, flea protection, heartworm/Lyme testing, treatments, and other vetting/issues that might be needed, for dogs in our care. Dog's Best Friend dogs truly make wonderful family pets. Please  email us for an application. (If you email us and do not hear back from us within 24 hours, please try again, as we most likely did not receive your email!) (Also note that many of our dogs are fostered just across the border into PA)",

            "description": "Reggie is such a great dog. Very clingy and loyal, as most all GSD's are. He has clearly had a terrible life recently, for he is all bones, which has weakened him, but he is getting stronger daily and is more active and playful. He is also hw+ and is on slow-kill treatment, which means he stays on his once a month medicine, for several months to come, til he is hw free. He is good with people and dogs, and might love to be a second dog in a home. Prefer he not be with really young kids, for that might be too much for him, although he is very gentle. Reggie is so smart and so handsome in person. This 6 year old boy is skin and bones, and only weighs about 63 lbs right now - he should weight at least 80. We prefer a home with GSD experience and a fenced yard. Please, open your hearts and homes to this awesome boy, for you will be so glad you did. CRPUPS@PTD.NET to contact us for any reason. (If you do not hear back from us within about 6 hours, send us your phone number, for there might be something wrong with your email! WE DO NOT TEXT) \nLovable Mutts Adoption Center is a private, in home, all breed rescue/adoption facility, specializing in all ages and sizes of dogs.  We exist only on the kindness of your donations and adoptions!  We pride ourselves on being an HOLISTIC center and feed only holistic grain free foods and give daily, various, vitamins and supplements to all of our dogs. \n\nOur dogs are well socialized, very friendly, well mannered, affectionate, and in wonderful health. While some might be timid or shy, we work with our adopters in any way we can, to help them to work with their new family member. We give training tips and behavioral tips and even board for a very reasonable fee. Our dogs are extremely well cared for - most even know how to use a dog door by the time they leave us, know basic commands, and are crate trained!  We stand by our pups/dogs, and give 10 days for a refund and almost always take our dogs back at any age of their lives (can sometimes depend on the dog)! \n\nLovable Mutts Adoption Center has an application screening process.  All applicants are asked to provide vet references, personal references, and a home visit.  We pride ourselves in matching up the right dog with the right home.  Sometimes this happens quickly and sometimes it might take awhile.  We hope you understand and are willing to wait for the perfect pup for your situation. We reserve the right to turn applicants down and to change our mind about a suitable match, for we are only concerned about what is best for our dogs.  Also note that we arrange our visiting hours around your schedule, as this is a private, in home facility.  We respond to all inquiries promptly, so if you have any trouble sending us an email, or have not heard back from us within 24 hours, please, CONTACT US AGAIN and check your spam!  (We all know how emails can be at times!)\n\nOur dogs are spayed or neutered (if old enough), up to date on vaccines, wormed, heartworm tested, and free of fleas and ticks.  We temperament test our  dogs and they are all suitable for many family situations. Our dogs are well mannered,  and are in our family/home situation at this time (not kept in kennels or crates), and are worked with daily.  All of our dogs do well with other dogs and many do well with cats, and we can cat test. Adoption donations vary with age, breed, vetting, and training of the dog, and range from $250 to $500. This donation helps to pay for shots, de-wormings, spays, neuters, flea protection, heartworm/Lyme testing, treatments, and other vetting/issues that might be needed, for dogs in our care.  (We do not tend to place puppies or small dogs with kids under 6 and reserve the right to match who WE feel would be the best homes for our dogs.)  \nPlease, come adopt one of our Lovable Mutts - you will be so glad you did!\n\n(IF YOU DO NOT GET A REPLY EMAIL WITHIN 24 HOURS, CHECK YOUR SPAM BOX - WE REPLY EVERY FEW HOURS TO EMAILS)",

Samson is an 8 year old love bug and it is his time to shine with a new family.  He was surrendered to the shelter by his owner who couldn\u2019t afford to sort out his medical issue. He was well loved for sure and you can tell by his fabulous demeanor.  This guy loves everyone and gets along with both his foster\u2019s other dogs and cat.  What a guy!  Since Samson has been in our rescue program, we have given him consistent medical care which involves tests and different types of medicines. In complete full disclosure, we think we have enough medical diagnosis and a treatment plan that he can now go his forever home.  We discovered that he has a thyroid issue which is now managed by medicine.  We are thrilled by his progress and look how his hair is growing back in!  What a handsome boy he will be soon. Due to the fact that he probably will need to have his medicine for his remaining days, we would hope that his new adoptive home have the financial means to keep up with what he might need medically.  Our rescue has figured so much out already so we are hopeful consistent monthly maintenance will be all that is required. If you truly have a rescue heart and want a lovely fur baby, EMAIL STORKWOODS@COMCAST.NET for an adoption application. We hope he captures your heart as he has ours!\n\nSamson is being fostered in Middle TN. We have foster homes in several areas of the country. \n\n",

            "description": "Sally is available for adoption to Texas residents only.\n\nSally is a young adult who has a sweet personality. She is timid, and not had a lot of human interaction, but absolutely doesn't want to leave your side once you earn her trust. She appears to have had at least one litter of puppies. Sally was picked up as a stray and was terrified in the shelter. She has blossomed into a calm, loving girl who is content to just hang out wherever you are. \n\nSally would probably do best with older children at least 7 or older. She has not shown any aggression to children, but since she is a bit timid we think younger children may be too much for her. When adopted, Sally will need a few days or longer to acclimate to her new surroundings. She still cowers like she may have been abused when you approach her. \n\nIf you are interested in applying for adoption, please copy and paste this link into your browser.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/1zGtCUUqOvBHxQtIy7j4-qA_W-b_PIitAaDXAf8MuKHg/edit",

She would love to have a fenced yard to chase squirrels and bask in the sun but that is not a deal breaker. \nIf you want to be considered for Gem please go to www.newhopepetrescue.com for an application.\n\n\nPlease check out our adoption process & on-line application here: https://www.newhopepetrescue.com/\n\nAdoption Fee for dogs cover the following vetting:\n\n1.

            "description": "J.R. is an adorable 5 month old Coonhound x Lab mix who recently joined our program. Not only is this boy cute as can be, but he\u2019s sweet as sugar. J.R. gets along with other dogs and is best suited for a home where he has a canine friend \u2013 for this reason, we will not consider applications for him unless there is another dog in the family. True to his breed, J.R. LOVES all of the amazing smells that walks have to offer and is a pretty \u201cnose-to-the-ground\u201d kind of boy. He thinks that cookies are the best, is good in the car and loves to meet new people. J.R. is looking for an active family who will be dedicated to taking him to positive reinforcement training classes for skill development and as a way to keep his little brain working and stimulated. This cutie would be fine in a home with kids 12 and over. Cats are unknown. For more information on this bundle of fun, email info@thedogrescuersinc.ca",

            "description": "This sweet old man in Jensen! He came to us from a shelter partner in Cleveland, and we think he is a boxer/pit bull mix. Jensen told us that he's happy to be in Pittsburgh because he's secretly been a Steelers fan all his life! Jensen is a big old guy, at 79 lbs and 7 years old, but this guy has so much life!\n\nJensen was found as a stray, so we don't know much about his past. However his previous shelter notes that he is house-broken! In shelter play groups, Jensen has shown that he's totally fine with dogs who are similarly chill and relaxed. He enjoys toys and food games, and would love to spend his golden years hanging out with you. Just like any other old guy, he has some worn teeth and some lumps. But our vet team has checked Jensen all over and thinks that he will blossom in the home. Apply for Jensen today!\n\nThank you for your interest in our adoptable animals! Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we do require appointments to see our adoptable animals. Please complete the adoption application and a Customer Care Associate will be in contact with you. PLEASE NOTE: We ask that when you submit your application, that you are available to schedule an appointment within the next 24-48 hours.",

AS LONG AS THIS DOG IS STILL POSTED, WE ARE STILL ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS FOR HER SO NO NEED TO EMAIL ASKING IF SHE'S AVAILABLE, WE WILL REMOVE THE LISTING WHEN APPLICATIONS ARE CLOSED.**\n\nAmy is a 3 month old husky mix who came to Precious Paws Rescue from a  community in northern Manitoba. She is an active and playful girl who is now fully vetted and ready to find her adoptive home!\n\nAmy is house trained, crate trained and she knows \"Sit\". She is working on her leash training and she is getting really good at it! Amy is also working on calming down and not nipping so she will need a family who is ready to continue her training for that. When going for car rides, Amy gets car sick and will throw up in the car. Amy is a quiet girl who does not bark much and she gets really excited to meet new dogs and people. Because of her nipping, Amy would do best in a home with older, dog savvy kids. She is also looking for a family who will commit to doing further training with her so that she can thrive in her new home. Amy is an active girl who is looking for an active family to go on lots of adventures with. \n\nFrom her foster: Amy is very active. She is great in her crate at night. Settles right down and goes to sleep. She plays hard and crashes hard. House training is going extremely well. She still likes to nip our hands and feet a lot though and can bark and try to challenge us when we tell her no. Treat training can be useful to distract her from bad behaviour and she sits and waits for her treats very patiently. She is a very smart girl and I believe she can be trained fairly quickly. Amy loves her walks, likes to pick up sticks, chase snowballs and the exercise helps tire her out and settle her down. She is pretty good on her leash but would need further training to walk right beside you and not to pull quite as much. She would probably be great in a family with another dog. She may be a bit nippy and excitable with young children. She is a sweet funny girl with a good temperament.\"\n\nThink Amy sounds like the right dog for you? Complete an adoption application on our website; www.preciouspawsrescue.ca Her adoption fee is $650 and includes up to date vaccines, fecal test and deworming, wellness bloodwork and heartworm test, spay and microchip. All adopters receive 6 weeks of free pet insurance and local adopters will receive a 6 week obedience class FREE courtesy of Ruff Haus in Barrie (www.ruffhaus.ca)",

Oh, I came from West Virginia to Hixton WI where I\u2019m currently being fostered. My foster mom says I\u2019d do best in a home with another dog (I agree!) and I do very well with young children, my current foster family has a 3 year old that I\u2019m buds with. I\u2019m still unsure of cats, I tried smelling one once and it hit me on the nose. Also, I\u2019ve been recently having a obsession with trying to run off (thankfully my foster family has a fenced yard) so my family will need to keep me tightly leashed or have a fenced yard until I trust people better and am trained. My foster mom wants to add that I\u2019ve had a rough start and SO ready to be shown how good life can be, but with my rough start my new family will need to be patient with me and willing to work with me daily. My foster mom wants to tell my new family that my right back leg was hurt a long time ago but I get around just fine and seems to not bother me but I do limp sometimes and it looks scary. I\u2019d love to meet you but don\u2019t take offense if I act like I don\u2019t. If your interested in coming to meet me and adding me to your family my adoption fee is $300 with a additional $100 for my spay deposit.

Please visit our website at www.perfectpetsrescue.org for an application and more information.  Volunteers who answer email do not have information on specific dogs and will direct you to put in an application.  Thank you.\nPLEASE read the requirements for Walter's new home before enquiring.\n\nWALTER PAWIN is a cutie for sure!   Walter is a very mellow man looking for a special home that will understand his needs. His foster mom tells us:       Typically, Walter asks for lots of space to feel comfortable. Though you will know when he is ready for attention because he will sit at your feet, flop over, and ask for belly rubs! When he needs his space, he\u2019s just as obvious about his wants. Walter would do best with a strong leader that is good at enforcing boundaries.   He is crate and house trained and walks well on a leash. He is dog friendly.  \nNo kids for Walter please.   Walter was not made available for adoption at animal control as he was not a happy camper and was very grumbly.  He needed rescue to get him out of there and we are glad we could help.   If you are interested in Walter, put in your application and we can put you in touch with his foster family to get more information on what kind of home would suit him best. \nThe shelter aged Walter around 9 years old, but we think he may be younger,  and he weighs 16 lbs.\nWalter has been vaccinated, dewormed, microchipped, heart worm tested negative and neutered.\nWe are asking for an adoption donation of $250 to help with the costs involved with caring for our rescue pets.",

Keeley is a 1-2-year-old lab mix weighing 45 lbs, a perfect size for either a home or apartment. She does well playing with other dogs and seeks out snuggles from any volunteer willing to accommodate her desire for ear rubs. Keeley is a lab mixed with other things wonderful and her personality shows it. She's looking for a forever family to make her own. Will it be yours? Don't delay - schedule time at SG to meet this girl!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

            "description": "Who doesn't love a goofy, fun-loving hound? Alec is all that and then some! He's around 2 years old and in great shape at 43lbs. Never one to meet a stranger, Alec is great with other dogs and loves being around people. While curious about some of the other farm animals at Saving Grace, he just watches from afar as if he's trying to figure out what kind of funny looking dog that is! Alec would prefer regular opportunities to explore the world with his nose, so he'll love to join you as a walking companion. We have all good things to say about this young boy who will fit in as a single dog or join your pack. He's gotten great host reviews and is ready for his forever home. Will it be yours? Send in your application today to visit with Alec.\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time.

This studly lab mix is strutting his stuff around the farm and we just can't get enough of him. Around 2 years old, he is a solid boy that enjoys a good romp with his friends followed by a nap in the sun. He plays well with other dogs and seems to have some basic commands down pat. He's a smart boy that learns quickly, so a forever home that is filled with activity and togetherness will suit him to a tee! Solo, with other dogs, Othello will do fine. He did whisper during his bio interview that he would really like a comfy bed in his new home, preferably as close to his new family as possible. Come out to Saving Grace and see for yourself how perfectly suited Othello is for his forever home.\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time.

Won't you be by James Bond and come get me so we can bond together?\nHere is what the crew has to say about me:\nPenny is a very sweet, social dog. She is around 1/2 years old and about 53lbs. She likes other dogs and kids too. This girl just like a ray of sunshine. Penny would make a great family dog.\nPlease call Faustina at 806-664-1615 since she can give you details about the animals!

I don't want to be the Lone Ranger, I want to be your ranger! I am very friendly and I like to smile the whole day long! I have that handsome fawn/grey coat and white gloves on. I'm getting my mojo on for my adoption day! I'm a handsome boy, if I must say so myself! Hey, I don't want to be the last on standing around here for the holidays. So ride on down here and see little old me.\nHere is what the crew has to say about me:\nMojo is friendly and easy on the eye. He is a little less than a year old and only 37 pounds. He is a love muffin for sure. So come down and get this little clown today!\nPlease call Faustina at 806-664-1615 since she can give you details about the animals! If you call the Pampa animal shelter please refer to the animals by their number listed after the names. Thank you for you cooperation!",

And a microchip too.  \n\nI enjoy playing with dogs and I would really love to find a home that has a dog to teach me stuff.  I love my Foster siblings,  we play and I am more brave when we go on walks together.  \n\nWhile I am still a fun puppy,  I am housebroken and I don't destroy people belongings.  I like to carry your stuff around, but its done nicely ??\n\nDo you have a yard?  I would love some space for potty and playing.   Maybe you like to go on drives?, cause I like to ride in a car.  And I even like to go to Doggie day camps too.  It's fun to have friends.  \n\nFill out the application to meet me, you will need to bring your dog too.  \n\nThanks a lot, love from Aria \n\nAria is up to date on her vaccinations, spade and is currently being fostered in Flagstaff. Her adoption fee is $215\n\nWe are a small rescue/foster group without an animal shelter. If you are interested in meeting Aria, please fill out an online adoption application, located here: http://tubacityhumanesociety.org/tuba-city-humane-society-dogcat-online-adoption-application/ with more information about our adoption process here:\nhttp://tubacityhumanesociety.org/adoptions/\n\nOnce we receive your application, which answers basic questions for us, we will have a conversation with you, before setting up a meeting. For more information, please contact Deb at dfranklin@tubacityhumanesociety.org or by phone at (928) 853-1046 (No calls after 7 p.m. please.)",
