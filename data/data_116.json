            "description": "Diagnosed with mast cell tumors. She was supposedly to be a short term hospice foster. But it has been almost 2 years since she was dumped at animal control and she is still doing great on meds (omeprazole, prednisone, Benadryl). Her previous life was one of severe neglect. She was used as a breeder and then discarded like trash. She is the sweetest girl and gets along with everyone. She gets a little grumpy if the other dogs try to take her food or if I'm eating. But that's understandable considering her background. She has so much love to give and would like a lap to snuggle in and gentle hands to pet her.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please cut and paste the link below to fill out an adoption application:\n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/92916416469165\n\nAfter the application is processed and approved, a home visit and meet and greet with the dogs will be scheduled. If there are any fencing issues, make sure that repairs are done prior to the home visit. MinPins are natural escape artists! Typically, the adoption is finalized the day after the home visit and meet and greet. Out of area adopters would need to drive/fly in to meet the dogs and adopt.",

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: 8/23/2017\n\nReason for being in rescue: Stray- nc shelter\nFoster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SC\nSpecial Needs? Ollie has no known medical issues but is very strong willed. He despises other dogs and cats and needs to be in a home where he does not have contact with other canines or cats. He will attack other dogs. It is sad because he was not like this originally but something changed.\nWeight: 46 lbs\nHeight: 21\" at the shoulder\n\nAdoption Fee: $200\n\nFence needed? Secure fence - prefer privacy please or a back yard that does not back up to a yard with a dog so he can play and not worry about the other dogs.\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Hmmm.. I'm really not hard to please. Just give me attention and let me lay around on the couch with you! I love people, I love living in a house and I love being part of your life. I am a lot of dog - you won't need another one if you have me.\n\nOllie is going to be amazing in the right hands. Our owner experince level for Ollie is an\n8 - More than 10 years as dog owner and preferrably with a terrier breed. Has taken at least three professional training courses. Long history of superior vet care. No history of rehoming or rehoming only for serious lifestyle challenge, worked through reputable rescue to place and follows up.\n\nWhat is my personality like? I'm Ollie Beckett and if my name wasn't already cute enough.. just look at my sweet face. I was found a stray in North Carolina and taken to a local shelter. I was actually just saved in the nick of time... I was making my way to be sent to doggie heaven until the lady walking me to \"the room\" saw my tail wag and it was all over from there. She begged and of course CPR said yes!\n\nI'm a silly boy that loves all humans. I can't possibly give out enough hugs for everyone around here. I will love you through the good times, and bad times. I will be your best friend through it all, given the chance. I walk well on a leash but I love love love sniffing everything I can so please let's make some walks slow walks. I don't know any basic commands yet but I bet I could learn. One of my favorite things to do is roll around on the couch and nuzzle under every blanket I can get under. I love, and I love hard, Please take me home!\n\nUpdate 6/18- I was returned to the rescue because I did not get along with some dogs that I have met. It was also said that I have separation anxiety and that I have lunged at people/cars going by. So far, the caregivers have not seen this behavior at the rescue either time I have been here.\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? friendly\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nMy age: Estimated birth date 8/24/2016\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

Goose had Blasto and went through a yearlong treatment - Due to the Blasto Goose has scarring on his lungs that will not allow him to be a dog that can be in the heat for long periods, go on long walks or run for longer periods. He is playful and still even has some puppy in him when he plays - loves going on walks and enjoying a good toy. Goose needs to be the only dog in the home with a family who is willing to continue his training and has a fenced backyard. \n\nIf interested please fill out an application on our website at www.HeddMutt.com or email us at info@HeddMutt.com. \n\nAdoption Requirements? - \nBe at least 21 years of age \nHave the knowledge and agreement of all adults living in the household \nHave approval from owner of residence (written in lease) \nHave a valid ID with current address \nBe approved as a suitable adoptive home by Hedd Mutt Foundation \nBe prepared to make a lifetime commitment",

This handsome young bridle boy is around 3.5 years old and happiest when he's running and playing fetch. Atlas is well trained and knows how to sit, shake, stay, lay down, wait, come, leave it and get up. Atlas is also muzzle trained, he prefers to wear this when meeting strangers or doing scary things like visiting the vet's office.\n\nAtlas would thrive in an active home with adults only who are dog savvy and maintain a relatively quiet home life. We don't know all of his background, but we know that strangers in the home are scary to Atlas and he isn't sure if he's supposed to protect you from them or not! Atlas loves to play, so another playful dog in the home would make for a perfect match! Atlas is kennel and potty trained, and also loves to give kisses. A 4-6 foot high fenced in yard would be a dream come true for ol' Atlas, here he could run and play to his hearts content and maybe learn some more impressive commands with a little help from his new family.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Atlas please complete an adoption application for consideration at www.AdoptHope.org. The adoption fee for Atlas is $250 and includes his neuter, microchip, current vaccinations and preventatives as well as a FREE obedience class through Cedar Run in Hiawatha. Our adoption process includes reference and background checks, a vet check and home visit.",

PLEASE FILL OUT OUR ADOPTION APPLICATION, ONCE PRE-APPROVED, GIVE US A CALL AND WE CAN SET UP AN APPOINTMENT FOR YOU TO MEET ME!\n\nI am 3 years old, 43 lbs., and looking for my forever home!\n\nAdoption Donation $300\n\nAll dogs are microchipped, neutered, current on all vaccines, heartworm tested and started on Tri Heart Plus; Vectra 3D.\n\nAll household members and any dogs from the household need to be present at the time of the adoption.\n\nOur website is always kept 100% up to date with who is currently available.  As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our 'Visit' page for hours and directions to our shelter.

Slim is some kind of bird dog, we think, and probably around 3 years old. :) He seems to get along with the other dogs. Have no history on cats so can't help with that! He is in an outdoor area at the rescue so we can't guarantee house training abilities but we bet he could pick it up real fast once he learned his new family's routine. HIs adoption is $150 to help with the cost of his neuter, microchip, vacs, and deworming. You can find our handy application at pbroklahoma.com.",

Missy came to rescue from GA with a terribly painful skin infection and mange. Look how stunning this beautiful girl is now!\nMissy was extremely scared of people when she came into foster. She has absolutely \"blossomed\" and is the life of the party in her foster family's pack. Missy MUST have another dog as she builds confidence and finds much happiness and peace surrounded by other canines. She does well with male and female dogs of all sizes. She is VERY shy and timid at first with human strangers and must build trust at her own pace. Once she feels secure, she turns into a playful, loving, affectionate girl who brings joy wherever she is! Missy is spayed, crate trained and house trained. She has very nice manners in the home. She enjoys her crate for her personal \"den\" and finds security there. Adopter must be willing to allow Missy to open up and trust at her own pace and seek attention in her own time.\nI\n\nf you can open your heart and home to Missy and give her the time and patience she so deserves, please apply at http://www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

            "description": "Please be aware that during COVID 19 social distancing regulations, we will NOT be placing Asher & Rolloe in a foster or forever home.  They are dogs with behavioral and fear issues, and we cannot simply \"drop him off at your door\".\n\nAsher and Rollie will require multiple meetings with his handler at the home. His handler MUST be able to watch the interactions and advise foster or adopter  how to manage the dogs appropriately.\n\nPlease DO NOT send in an application for Asher & Rollie until COVID 19 resolved and we can go back to visiting fosters and adopters in their homes..\n\nThank you!\n\n*****\"********************\"\"\"*********\n\nRollie and Asher are best pals and can never be separated.. Both dogs were dumped in an abandoned gravel pit In Abbotsford about 3 years ago.  They were extremely fearful and hard to catch. \n\nAsher is an Australian terrier mix and is about 5 years old...Rollie is a chihuahua pug mix and he is about 7 years old.  \n\nThey have come a long way since they were caught years ago.  Both dogs have lots of fear issues and are not fully trusting of humans.  Asher has become somewhat friendly and loving now, but he still has initial fears with new people and new environments. Rollie is still not 100% trusting of his human counterparts but is not aggressive.  He does tend to follow Asher's lead.\n\nBoth dogs need a foster home to see how they will do in a home environment.  Moving them to a new environment will re trigger their fears/ptsd and they will regress after being moved..  it will take a few months for them to settle into a new routine with new people.  They need to be house trained. They have been good on leash but in quiet areas only.  High traffic areas would not be suitable or ideal for Asher and Rollie.  Noises such as cars and trucks would trigger their fears.  Lots of strange people walking passed in busy areas would send them over the roof. \n\nThey should be in a home with a fully fenced, escape proof yard to ensure they can be house trained. Their leash training should also begin there. \n\nNeither dog has any basic obedience training, as we only worked on them learning to trust humans.  They should not be flooded or forced to do things most normal dogs would be doing such as going for walks on leash right away, no off leash dog parks.  Not taking them to busy functions, stores or areas.  \n\nThey have been good with small and large dogs.  And have left the cats alone. \n\nAbsolutely NO children in the foster home due to them still having fear triggers. \n\nWe are looking for a FOSTER HOME ONLY AT THIS TIME.  \n\nNo apartments.  Access to fully fenced yard escape proof yard is a must. (no exceptions) \n\nIf you are interested in fostering please send us an email and we will have you complete the foster application and have an interview and a home visit  to ensure you have the experience and patience to work with our 2 special boys. \n\n",

            "description": "This is Ashima, a female, 26 lb, brindle and white terrier mix whose  estimated date of birth is June, 2016. Her name means \"Limitless\" however, this girl keeps finding herself in impossible situations that set her up to lose. \n\nHer people failed her. Ashima found herself pregnant and surrendered to a shelter, her chances of getting out were slim to begin with. Then she developed an upper respiratory infection and that took her situation from bad to worse. The transport leaving the state picked another dog over her and she was stuck waiting again. When ARF stopped by that day she jumped at the chain link and tried to get to us as fast as possible to give kisses. After all this time she had not given up hope, we knew she needed another chance.\n\nAshima is an happy, fun and active dog who would love to go running with an active person! She has healthy boundaries and an assertive personality because she knows what she likes and what she does not! Ashima is much too interested in cats and finds small children annoying so she would likely do best in a home as the only \"child\" or with another active dog about her size. Ashima is crate trained and would like a privacy fence since she is a gifted fence climber that finds chain link ones to be a good piece of exercise equipment ? Please help us find her a home where she can finally live up to her potential. Ashima may out of the shelter but now she needs someone to step up and help her live without the limits life keeps trying to impose on her!\n\nAshima has a $150.00 adoption fee plus the cost of 6 months of heart-worm prevention.  \n\n\nNote: ARF reserves the right to deny any application that is deemed unsuitable for the animal. Please be aware that our animal adoptions are NOT on a first come- first serve basis. Our sole purpose is to find the best possible home for the animals that fall under our care. We do not ship our animals. All adopters are expected to come to Tulsa if approved.\n\nFor details on how to adopt please visit http://www.arftulsa.org/howtoadopt.html",

She arrived at AA in poor health with very bad teeth. She's has had all of her teeth removed.  she has episodes of vestibular disease where she gets dizzy and disoriented but she does come out of those epidsodes which last a few days.  She does need to be hand fed during those times (every couple of months)<P>\n\n\nWHAT'S NEXT?\n\nIf you would like to meet, foster or adopt this pet, please fill out our online FOSTER/ADOPTION APPLICATION which can be found in the main menu of our website or at the bottom of this page - simply copy and paste the link into your browser. EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs.\n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

If you are a good fit for the animal you are interested in -we will call to speak with you, If we feel you are not a good fit , we will contact you about other pets that may be a good fit for your home. Many people are losing the opportunity to adopt the animal they want because they fail to put in an application and the pet was adopted before we could answer your email. .If you have applied for an animal in our facility and have not received a response within 7 days, PLEASE call or contact us again. Though we do our best in trying to answer all emails in a timely manner, sometimes things get away from us, get lost or misplaced.

FENCED IN YARD A MUST - NO ACCEPTIONS.\n\nKara and her sister Ada were an emergent situation due to the death of their owner. One of our fosters jumped into action and retrieved their outside pens, houses the works and moved it all into her backyard. \n\nThese two beautiful sisters remain living outside and it is not what any of us ultimately want and we are looking for an adopter to continue working with Kara and Ada and we are hoping they can live inside of an experienced adopters home. \n\nKara and Ada's kennels will be donated to the approved adopter to continue working with them and with patience and training move them into the home. \n\nKara is a 2 year old Husky mix, weighs 33 pounds, UTD on vaccines, spayed and heart worm positive (being treated with slow kill method).  Kara is an extreme love bug.  She loves to be petted, plays ball, gives her belly to be rubbed and gives a ton of kisses.  \n\nKara is food & toy aggressive towards other dogs but is fine with other people. \n\nAbsolutely no young children in the home and a physical fenced in yard is a must and is not negotiable.\n\nTheir foster mom has been working with them on training, they have come a very long way and an experienced adopter will need to continue working on socializing these two beautiful girls.  \n\n",

She also lets you know when she must go outside by pawing at your hand and giving you a quick kiss. She loves to run around in the yard and when she's tired out, she wants to rest by your side.\n\nSunny wants nothing more than to be by your side and craves attention. Her foster reports that she just wants to be loved and feel safe!\n\nPlease read all adoption steps and policies carefully on our website. http://dobermanrescueminnesota.com/adoption-steps/\n\nQualified adopters are within the approved adoption area, and Adopter will be requested to visit this foster dog at the foster family home.

She came to us very skittish and shy and while she has come leaps and bounds in her foster home, her background of neglect from the puppy mill is coming with her. She can get scared in new situations and with new people and does take a bit to warm up to people. But once she does, she lets her personality shine, which is crazy, active, silly and smart and often mischievous. She knows not to jump on you to say hi, but sometimes she just cannot help it. She knows the garbage is off limits, but you know, sometimes there is just something so wonderful in there that she thinks she needs to bend the rules a bit. She loves toys, and stuffies are her favorites, but she still thinks eating them is a fun thing to do so only certain toys are Lorelai OK'd at this point. Because she thinks anything left out is hers, we do not want young children in the home. Toys and stuffed animals left out will be appropriated and eaten.\n\nWe are looking for a home for Lorelai that has lots of patience, understands that routine is the key to her comfort and that has at least one other dog for her to gain confidence and learn from. Now that her pups are adopted and in wonderful homes, it is her turn. She is not going to be a super easy dog at first but we guarantee that all the love you put into her will be given back tenfold.",

This little girl had a very rough beginning it appears since when we rescued her, she was blind and not very sociable with neither humans or dogs- she was very scared and would not venture away from her \"safe\" space. However, since being in a foster home where she knows she is safe and cared for, she has learned it's ok to seek out attention and has become very independent and self-confident!! Nina now loves to be the center of attention and we are looking for a home where she will be the only dog - she really deserves that since she had been so neglected in years past. Nina loves to go outside and explore the green space, but she is piddle pad trained so she'd be perfect as a companion for someone living in a condominium or apartment too. She is quite the low maintenance type of gal but like all Cocker Spaniels she does require occasional trips to the groomer which she actually LOVES! If interested in adopting Nina please fill out an application at www.floridacockerrescue.org ADOPTION FEE: $200.00",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website. HI! I'M ASHER! I love long walks and LOVE to play! First thing people and canines notice about me are my bright green eyes! Darn Im handsome! My foster parents tell me I am a good boy and notice when I first meet people I am a little timid and shy but I slowly warm up and love the attention and compliments that come thereafter. When I lived with my former dad, I wasnt well socialized and got hurt by two of my siblings, so, I get scared of other dogs when we go for our walks(I am dog reactive when I see a dog)and we are working on that! My foster family are working with me now on learning how to meet and greet new people and pets. Even though I get scared when I see other dogs, I LOVE my foster parents dogs! I LOVE to play with my foster mommy and her fur children(be part of the pack) just no rough play,makes me nervous. I am also told I think I am a lap dog and love to snuggle and get some lovin! My former owner told my foster mommy that I was his 'therapy' dog. I snuggled with my dad when he was having a hard day or suffering from ptsd. I AM a good boy, I just had a hard upbringing and just need some work with a professional trainer to work on my socialization skills and learning to greet new fur friends. As I said before, I get along well with my foster parents dogs but I met them slowly,after a couple of weeks with some training and now LOVE my brothers and sisters!I am not sure if I would do well with someone who has dogs, maybe if someone takes the time to work with me on slow greeting.. As for cats, I do not chase or show aggression to my foster moms cats but Im working on properly greeting them since Im excited to see them. I think I will do well with a cat/s that is used to dogs...I think a good mommy and/or daddy candidate would be someone who has experience with dogs and has time and patience to work with a trainer on my issues with interaction with other dogs. Ideally,someone who is home with me (I LOVE being with my human and prefer that to being alone) but I do well when at home alone too;someone who has time to be with and work with me and would be a strong handler..\nPlease contact app@aarfhouston.org for more information about this dog. You can apply online by clicking on Application . Once your application is approved, we will schedule a meet and greet at one of our adoption events. Thank you for considering a rescue! The adoption fee includes vaccinations, Bordetella, de-worming, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip. There is a an additional $12.99 fee for Home Again for a lifetime registration of the microchip.\nPuppies cannot be adopted outside of the Houston area until they are spay/neutered after they are 4 months old. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.\nNOTE: In our bios, we provide information based on our volunteer's experience with a particular dog; such as temperament, training, and ability to get along with others.\nAARF is a 501(c)3 Non Profit, all breed, no kill organization. Our group is always in need of donations in order to continue to give the needed medical care to our rescues. Adoption fees do not begin to cover all of the medical costs. Any donation , no matter how small is a big help and is greatly appreciated. Please help us to continue to help them. Thank you.",

The officer who talked to her, called me to see if I could help, since the shelter cannot take owner surrenders. I had recently had some adoptions, so I told him that he caught me at a good time. He brought the young dog to me later that day, and I didn't get the dog's name from the home, so I named him Callan.\n\nI took Callan to the Gresham Veterinary Hospital on 4/13/18 to get vaccinated, he was listed as a Doberman mix, 1.5 years old, weighed 44.6 pounds, and was neutered by Dehart Veterinary Services on 4/14/18.  As of 5/10/20, he weighs 54 pounds.\n\nCallan is good with adults and children, loves to play with the other dogs, has a high pitch bark at times when he sees things like squirrels in the trees, is good on a leash, and crate trained.  He loves to be pet, and will put his head on my lap to get pet.  He requires a fenced yard, and is not an apartment dog.  He didn't like to be crated at night, but got better.  I eventually stopped putting him in a crate at night, since he does well outside at night.\n\nCallan's adoption fee is $85. Anyone interested in adopting him, please e-mail me at TMSGriffith@aol.com.",

Someone was kind enough to love them and give them a good home for a long time; however, because of health and age (92), this person needs to find them a new home. Lucky now needs someone else to love and care for him. He is neutered, current on shots and flea/heartworm preventive, and micro-chipped. Please call 817-247-0076 for more information.",

She is a Lab mix, weighs about 35-40 pounds, and is about 10 years old. She walks with a limp due to arthritis in a joint. (Honey has a brother named Lucky- also on Petfinder).  Honey and her siblings were found starving on the side of the road. Someone was kind enough to love them and give them a good home for a long time; however, because of health and age (92), this person needs to find them new home. Honey now needs someone else to love and care for her. She is spayed, current on shots and flea/heartworm preventive and is micro-chipped. Please call 817-247-0076 for more information.",

As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our 'Visit' page for hours and directions to our shelter.

            "description": "LUCA\nDOB: February 14, 2015*\n\nLuca is one of those dogs whose picture you see online and fall so madly in love with him you think you couldn't love him anymore. Then you meet him, and your heart explodes. He is that loveable.\n\nLuca is a little shy at first, he has had his heart broken by unworthy people in the past, so patience with him at first is the best way to win his heart. But once he warms up, you get the full Luca experience. He will adore you just as much as you adore him, 70 pounds of total adoration, devotion and kisses. Had a bad day? Luca can help. He can lounge around and watch a movie with you or lift your spirits with a little rousing game of fetch and tag in the backyard with his Kong. He will plop his big fat head in your lap, look up at you with those gorgeous green eyes and you can see how much he loves you and wants to make life better for you. This guy will touch your soul and you will know love.\n\nHis favorite toy is his Kong. When he is nervous it acts like a binky for him. He is very smart and listen well. He just wants to please and make his person happy. \n\nLuca is a Mastiff/Bully mix about 3 or 4 years old (as of 2018). He weighs in around 70 pounds, which is all solid muscle. He is neutered, current on vaccinations, microchipped, good with properly introduced dogs, but especially good with the ladies. His has beautiful green eyes and a shiny. gorgeous fawn colored coat with white markings. He hasn't had any prior experience with cats so we suggest a home without any feline companions, or maybe a very dog savvy cat. He is house trained, crate trained, good on a leash, knows basic obedience (but can have a bout of 'bully hearing' when sniffing something especially interesting in the yard lol), loves car rides and is an all around good dog. Because of his size, we recommend a home without small children. He can get very exuberant in his play and may accidentally knock small children down. We want both Luca and his new family to be happy so a home experienced with bully breeds is a must.\n\nAdoption Process: Application, Interview, Homecheck\nAdoption Fee: $250\n\nThis dog is located near Fresno, Ca\n\n*Age is always a guess with rescue dogs but here at Paw Printz we believe everyone should have a birth day so when the vet guesses at their age, we work out what would be a good birthday for each dog and make it so!",

They were found  running loose in Lee County Florida,  Now that they've been in a foster home for over a year they have settled down and decided being a pet is the life they crave.  \n\nThese two are SUPER active, so we seek an active person or family for them.  They have put on some pounds with us, but should weigh around 10 pounds.  We want to keep them together since they have never been apart.\n\nWe only adopt to homes within 3 hours driving distance from Ft. Myers, Florida.  We do home visits prior to adoption and only adopt to homes where the dogs will be maintained as indoor house pets.  \n\nAllie and Gator's pair adoption fee is $500.  They are very healthy, up to date on all vaccinations, spayed and neutered, and ready to go home with you!",

I want a home where I am the only dog and can be the center of attention all the time. I also want a quiet home with no crazy kids running around and in my space. My new owner should realize that I do like things my way and he or she should be comfortable with that. If you would just give me a chance I could show you how loving I can be. I spent all of my 15 years with one owner so this getting adopted thing is kind of scary for me. If your interested in my please go to www.libertyacresunited.com and submit an application.\n",

Energetic, alert, fun-loving, Cadence is ever ready for an outdoor adventure. Running and exploring in a yard is a favorite activity, but he also likes walks and has solid leash manners. He will gladly hop into a car in hope it might mean adventure, or simply in joy that he gets to go with his people. A typical Boxer personality, Cadence loves time spent with the humans and relishes attention--playing or exploring together, ear scratches, belly rubs--it\u2019s all good as far as Cadence is concerned. This sweet guy truly wants to please his family if only they will lovingly teach him what they expect of him. Daily exercise and a home with a fenced yard in which to run and play are musts for this big, hardy guy. Cadence is eager to win a family\u2019s hearts the way he has ours.\n\nVisit Cadence at www.hua.org!",

A Black Mouth Cur/Rhodesian Ridgeback mix born in 2013, Xena came into rescue from Texas with her 8 puppies. Her pups have gone to their forever homes and Xena is more than ready for her happy ever after! She is truly a sweet and loving girl - very friendly and enjoys the company of people and other dogs. She doesn't care to share her toys and her bones, so we suggest a home with older children. Xena has a lot of energy, needs attention and exercise and would do best in a home with a fenced-in yard with room to run. Xena is large dog; about 80 pounds. She is spayed and up to date on vaccines. It's time for this princess to experience the good life and we can't wait to find the special someone who will love and pamper her forever! If you would like to make Xena the newest member of your family and love of your life, please fill out an adoption application for her here:\nhttp://www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org/general-application",

            "description": "Alexa, play Sugar Sugar by the Archies. Now that youve got that song playing in the background, youre in the proper zone to learn about the sweetest girl around, our very own Sugar!\n\nSugar really does have it all: the looks, the manners, and the drive to be the very best friend around. She successfully completed a three month board-and-train program at Golden Heart Canine where she was a star pupil, and those skills have stuck with her! She has fantastic leash manners and knows all the basic commands. An added bonus is that Sugar is very treat motivated, so shes always eager to learn new skills and tricks. If you need some proof, just ask her to shake! She also loves trying to chase bunnies so will do a great job of keeping your yard clear of intruders. Sugar is quite an active girl, and always smiles when shes out on walks and hikes. Peep her photos to see this sweet girl in her happy place out in the Colorado sun!\n\nSugar LOVES playing with other dogs, always asking permission and then approaching her fellow canines with many lady-like grunts to let you know that the wrestling match has begun. Because she is a little bit unaware of her size, we recommend a house that has no feline friends or other small mammals (including children!) right now.\n\nThough Sugar is the biggest sweetheart, she had to overcome quite a past to reach this point. Sugar was adopted as a puppy and never socialized. She was returned to the rescue as a very shy, easily frightened adult who was slow to warm up to people. Although Sugar has improved her social butterfly status, she is still working through this timidness and so it will likely take more than one meet and greet before she will let her guard down to start becoming familiar and comfortable with you.\n\nThat being said, once Sugar comes out of her shell theres no putting her back in! She really makes you feel like the most important person on the planet whenever she sees you, even if you were only gone for 5 minutes. Sugar is looking for her people to share kisses with, grab a good belly rub from, and take some Colorado joyrides in the car. She reaches peak happiness when poking her head out the window feeling the wind rushing through her fur! If you can show her patience and take the necessary steps to help Sugar trust you, she will reward you with unending love and affection. Sugar is the candy girl, and cant wait to blast that tune with the windows down and her best friend by her side!\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

I was an owner surrender due to my owner moving and I couldn't go too. I was described by the shelter as being very sweet, very friendly and a favorite of volunteers. I'm grateful to C.A.R.L. for rescuing me before it was too late.\n\nI've been lucky enough to be in a foster home since April 2020 where everyone is basically home all day. They've created an Instagram page just for me. rocco_rockz. They say I'm rather stiff in my back legs and I can't get in the car by myself or get up a full flight of stairs. I get to go on two walks a day. I need a home with no younger children. My foster family has a 16 and 17 year old who I do great with.\n\nI love being with my people and don't enjoy being left alone. If one person leaves, I wait by the door and cry until they come back.\n\nI'm dog reactive and would do best as the only dog in your home. I'm easier to control on walks with a harness. I need a home with no cats. I'm also a creature of habit so will do best with a set routine.\n\nI hope you'll open your heart and home to wonderful me.\n\n*Thank you to Sharon for sponsoring this wonderful dog and giving him the chance for a better life..\n\nAdditional information: *Housetrained *Needs home with no small children *Needs home with no dogs *Needs home with no cats *Current on shots",

If you are reading this bio...she is still available.\nGwennie is a sweet energetic roughly 7 year old Boxer/Staffie Terrier. She was owned by a homeless person who was unable to care for her and wanted her to have a better life. She was pregnant at the time and had 8 beautiful puppies and now Gwennie is ready to find her forever home as well.\nGwennie is still acting young and has a lot of energy. She would do great in a home with an active family who could make sure she has plenty of exercise.\nGwennie is selective with her dog friends. She can get along with some other dogs but would prefer to be an only dog.\nGwennie is sweet and funny and playful and a girl who thinks every day is a new adventure!\nIf you are interested in Gwennie, please complete the online application which can be found at kcpaws.petfinder.com and it will be forwarded to the group or individual seeking a new home for this family pet.",

            "description": "Sweet, silly Sassafras!   This lovely Cane Corso girl knows her forever family is out there somewhere. and Miss Sassy wants her new people to know these 10 things about her:\n\n1.  I was treated terribly before I came to rescue.  The people at my old home would lock me in the house for weeks with just a pile of food, or tie me to the front porch for days, while they went off and did other things.  I was always hungry and always hurting.  I\u2019m very lucky that my awful owners had responsible neighbors who didn\u2019t stop calling the dog police until they came to get me.  \n\n2.  When I got to the shelter, I was very scared and I got very sick.  I acted like a complete jerk to almost everyone, but the Bullpen saw right through my act and asked me to come to the sanctuary. \n\n3.  I am learning every day that people are good and that I can trust them.  My foster mom says I am making wonderful progress and I should be proud of myself, even if I am still a total grump when I meet new people.  \n\n4.  When I see people that I know, I turn into a super wiggle-butt snuggle monster.  I can\u2019t help myself.  I just want to be around them and play with toys with them and be petted.  I\u2019m definitely one of the most affectionate dogs at the sanctuary.\n\n5.  When I meet other dogs through the fence, I wag my tail at them, and I think I could happily live with an easy-going, big male dog if we were properly introduced.  Because I was so sick at the shelter, I wasn\u2019t allowed to meet any other dogs, so I\u2019m not sure how I feel about little and medium sized pups. \n\n6.  My kennel at the shelter was close to the pen where they keep goats and chickens, and I was generally oblivious.  When I see birds and squirrels and the occasional cat here at the sanctuary, I\u2019m interested for a few seconds, but then I forget about them.\n\n7.  My ideal home would be with an adults-only family that is willing to work with me on building confidence, and that doesn\u2019t have many visitors to the house.  New people are scary to me, and when I\u2019m afraid, I am not my best self.  \n\n8.  I am really good on a leash, and will go into a crate, even if I don\u2019t like it.  I know how to use a dog door and will sit when you tell me.  I do, however, have a bad habit of jumping up to get your attention, and I need my forever family to keep working with me to curb the behavior.\n\n 9.  My back end is a little funny.  There, I said it.  It\u2019s really only noticeable when I sit down, but it\u2019s hard to miss. The veterinarian took x-rays of my legs and pelvis but couldn\u2019t find anything that would really explain it.  I have no trouble getting around, but the Bullpen thought it was best to start me on a daily anti-inflammatory, which I take without complaint.  \n\n10.   I am current on vaccinations, microchipped, and spayed.  I\u2019ve started heartworm treatment, and will come with all the medicine needed to complete it at my new home.\n\nReady to give Sassy the forever home of her dreams?  Fill out our Adoption Application, located at bullpenrescue.org under the 'work with us' tab. We highly recommend that our potential adopters fill out an online application as soon as possible, as it greatly expedites the process of finding the right dog for your situation.  \n\nOur dogs are available for adoption nationwide but preference is given to adopters willing to do an in-person meeting.  Please understand that our dogs are not adopted on a first-come, first-serve basis, but rather we strive for a \"perfect placement\" so we know that they will not be failed again.\n",

            "description": "WHERE IS THIS DOG NOW ?- This pet is currently located in foster in Belgrave\n\n**ALL ABOUT  JASMINE  **\nBorn approx 2017.\nShe was said to be 1 year old on intake then and she had just had pups. So she was about 3 in 2020.\nLast weigh-in she was 38 lbs.\n\nPEOPLE SKILLS -\nShe initially only trusted the Foster who got her out of a trailer she was living in with 32 others mid June 2018.\n\nShe is still a very scared girl with strangers.\nShe will bite IF her space and cues are not respected. \nThis is a fear-defensive response in order to set boundaries that are not being respected.\n\nKIDS -\nShe would not suit a home with infants/toddlers/kids.\n\nVISITORS -\nShe does not prefer visitors in the home.\n\nCATS -\nShe is fostered with cats.\n\nDOGS -\nShe is fostered with her brother who was adopted by the foster - he is half her size.\n\nFoster says that she prefers to play with the bigger dogs and can play rough, so a smaller dog is not an appropriate match for her play style. ie no Yorkies please. \nShe needs a home with dogs used to playing like she prefers.\n\nSince she loves to play with certain other dogs in her foster home she MUST have one in her adoptive home. \n\nVEHICLES -\nShe likes car rides with her foster Mom.\n\nHER HISTORY -\nMid June 2018 we took in 28 out of a trailer after owners left them in 40 degree heat for 4 days. \n\nThe owners had done this before and thankfully a foster was able to remove the majority, after the O.P.P attended the scene.\n\nWith 33 dogs/pups total in the camping trailer - every single female already had pups or was pregnant despite being said to be only 12-18 months old.\n\nThere was no way to know who is who's father.\n\nThere was no way to know the breeds of the litters.\n\nJasmine is a mix breed.\n\nShe even took on another Mother's son to surrogate.\n\nThey had no food in the camping trailer and the owners admitted when this happened that they would feed them noodles.\n\nHer 3 boys consisted of Wilson, Mulligan and Bogey.\n\nThe middle litter of 2 boys, consisted of Gizmo and Sprocket.\n\nShe raised Sprocket as her own.\n\nMany of the pups had the shihtzu underbite.\n\nWhen she went to be spayed the vet found a large scar up her stomach and the owner's had said they had never been vetted so the vet's believe the owner's did a home c-section on her.\n\nREQUIREMENTS -\nShe needs fear defensive experienced adopters, adults ONLY no children.\nShe needs a home with no visitors.\nShe would need a secure yard to enjoy and fear reactive dog experience.\nShe would need an active canine playmate in the home.\n\nIf your home has few to no visitors, has rescue savvy adults, and sounds compatible to her needs -\nYou can apply online at www.adoptapet.lucknow.on.ca \n\nHer adoption fee-  $500 with spay/painkiller, dewormer, vaccs, parasite prevention\n\nOnce we review your application then your family and existing dog can come and meet and see if they are the match you are looking for.\n\n** WE DO NOT ADOPT OUT OF ONTARIO **\n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN ADOPTING A RESCUE DOG - PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE FEED TO ANSWER ALL YOUR QUESTIONS \n**BASIC INQUIRIES ASKING QUESTIONS THAT ARE PROVIDED WILL NOT BE ANSWERED. ** WE ARE ALL VOLUNTEERS WHO HAVE EXISTING PETS/ FAMILY/ PAYING JOBS. OUR TIME IS IN SHORT SUPPLY AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR UNDERSTANDING\n******************************************************\n\n*** HOW IT WORKS - ADOPTION INFORMATION **** \n***ONLY RECEIVED & APPROVED APPLICATIONS WILL BE CONSIDERED FOR A VIEWING..-**No exceptions  **\n Do not ask to pop by to view a dog - it will be declined. Our dogs are in various locations in foster homes. Viewings are arranged with volunteers ,around rescue work, reg jobs and family  and only offered to an approved app to ensure its a possible fit for the dog and applicant and to not waste anyone's time.\n\nAll info on adoption process/ policies can be accessed at www.adoptapet,lucknow.on.ca \n**.Applications \nhttp://www.adoptapet.lucknow.on.ca/applications.html--This is a MS Word copy of our application.\nIt can be completed, saved and emailed back to the rescue at \npetrescue@hurontel.on.ca . \n\n1.

Blanco, Texas with a mouth and face full of porcupine quills and starving. A farmer spotted him and alerted us to his plight. We found him under a trailer in a very rural area with no houses or people nearby. We caught this sweet boy and took him to our vet immediately. He recovered nicely and gained all his weight back. He has been neutered, vetted, and microchipped. While Quinn was recovering, he got to spend time in a foster home with cats. He was curious but never showed any aggression. Since that time he has been housed at our kennels. Quinn has one female fur-friend that he plays with in the play yard. Her name is Trixie. Quinn is okay with some young puppies but not older dogs, or other large dogs. Quinn would love a home by himself or even with Trixie. This guy has TONS of energy and loves to get out and run and zoom around the play yard. He is very strong so a home with small children would not be recommended. He would do great with older kids. Please come meet Quinn! He is always overlooked. He is a kennel favorite!",

I will cradle the ball, G'ma comes up from behind and kicks the ball, and I chase it. Then we repeat the process!\n\nI also Love to take walks (preferably in the morning and early evening, when it is coolest), as well as longer walks or hikes on the weekend. I follow directions when asked: Heal; sit; down; up; shake; gentle (when taking a treat); quiet (when going up the stairs); mellow (when I get too excited); pass it up (when another dog - small or big - and its owner walking across the street).\n\nI will do best in a home with no small children or cats. I am kind, loyal, quirky, and a cuddler. And I Love happiness, and fun!\n\nIf you'd like to meet me, please contact my G'ma: Diana 925.876.1672\n\nFor more information or to meet this pet, please complete an application or send email to info@underdogaz.com\n\nIf you're reading this via a pet-search site, please view this pet's page\n\nat www.UnderdogAZ.com/animals\n\nfor more photos and details.",

Here is what would work best for me in my new home:\n\n-Personality: Goofy, exuberant, playful, loyal\n-Can Live with Kids: Ages 16+\n-Can Live with Cats: No, I like to chase cats and small animals.\n-Can Live with Dogs: Maybe another tolerant adult dog! I'll have to meet any potential canine housemates first to make sure we're a good match.\n-Can do Apartment Living: No - Addy would thrive in a home with a large yard where she doesn't have to worry about lots of neighbors walking by.\n-Potty Trained: Yes\n-Bite History: No, but history with fear of strangers.\n-Positive Reward Based Obedience Classes Required: Yes, at least one private lesson. \n-Leash Trained: Yes\n-Energy Level: Medium/high\n-Needs Medical Procedure Before Going Home: No\n-Additional Information: Addy is a silly dog who loves to play! Addy may have at one point enjoyed being a hiking or jogging buddy, but days of high impact or strenuous exercise are behind her. She has some stiffness in her limbs due to a cruciate injury and will need a milder exercise routine for management, ideally under the guidance of a vet. She would benefit from a continued high quality, low calorie diet to help her lose some weight and reduce stress on her limbs. In lieu of heavy physical exercise, Addy would benefit from extra mental stimulation - food puzzles, hide and seek, trick training - with her future adopter. Addy does have a history of fearfulness with strangers, so she will need a patient household willing to work with and manage her quirks. If you're looking for a snuggle buddy extraordinaire, fill out an application to meet Addy today!",

While the west coast has all the sunshine, I wanted to see how the mid-west farmers daughters lived. All the dog volunteers at Last Hope say I am the sweetest little girl, I love to snuggle, and give tons of kisses. I love to ride in the car and go for walks and I am super good at both! I am a very strong girl and need someone equally as strong. I am a princess and love all the attention so I will need to be the only pet in the house. I also need a home that has a privacy fence in case the neighbors have pets. So if you always wished they all could be California girls and wanted one of your own, then I am your girl.....\n\nKaia's adoption fee is $250 and includes her spay, micro chip and current vaccinations. Last Hope requires that all of our animals be kept on year round heart worm preventative and as indoor dogs only. Our adoption process includes a background check, personal and vet reference checks as well as a home visit.",

I had a few adoptions at that time, so I had space to tag some dogs from the shelter. I asked who had been there the longest, and needed out. Immediately I was told Louise and Sarge.\n\nLouise has joined what I call my yard dogs that get to run the fenced in area of our property instead of going in a large dog pen, and goes in a crate at night. She barked a lot at first and doesn't always like to go in the crate, but is doing much better now. She still gets anxious to get out in the morning. She is good on a leash, good around adults and children, and LOVES getting in our water tubs.\n\nLouise was picked up on FM 2767 and Greenwood on 3/7/18 weighing 73 pounds, heartworm positive, estimated to be 6 years old, and was not doing well being in the kennels. I had her spayed on 4/14/18, and she is on Ivomec for heartworm prevention, which will eventually help to kill the heartworms she has.\n\nLouise's adoption fee is $85. Anyone interested in adopting her can e-mail me at TMSGriffith@aol.com.",

You may remember the video of Apricot from Fulton County Animal Services, where she kissed the hand of the technician about to euthanize her, and captured the hearts of over two thousand viewers on Facebook.  Obviously, Apricot was not euthanized that day. And here she is, enjoying the morning air at ARSF in Jacksonville. Apricot is blind, and suffers from an autoimmune disease that may cause issues in the future, but can be successfully controlled with medication.

He loves kids but is an excited jumper so they need to be able to withstand his enthusiasm, and with a slow introduction to dogs, he has done well. If a dog is dominant or aggressive, he tends to react in that manner as well. He is altogether a wonderful dog. He's excelled well with his foster family and neighbors kids.\n\nHe loves toys and blankets and pillows are his thing.He has a  pillow like dog bed  and he loves it. Put a blanket on it and he's set or if he's on the couch, he puts his head on the pillow and sleeps like a human. \n\nTitan is super laid back, yet will go on walks or run around the yard or play with toys whenever his human wants. He's not a needy dog at all unless his water bowl is empty.  Then he will push it around my kitchen floor to get your attention \n\nWhen he is fed, he sits and waits patiently until his food is mixed and his bowl is placed down in front of him.  He does need some help in the walking on a leash with harness department.  He is motivated to learn with treats, so be sure to have plenty on hand, just please make sure there is no duck in his food or treats.  He does love to pass the time chewing on Nylabones.\n\nTitan is house broken and is crate trained.  He is a smart, loving boy and will always let you know he loves you by nudging you with his nose, or a gentle headbutt.\n\n He has some separation anxiety and is on medication to control it. He struggles in the cage due to his anxiety, but when left out with his fur siblings, he does amazing. \n\nTo learn more contact us at adoption@ihadro.org or apply today at www.ihadro.org!

Once he feels comfortable he will open up his trust, really enjoy his time with his people and is super smart.  He is ready to bound outside for fun times or leash activities. He needs lots of room to run and play with a 6 foot wooden fence and he can be overly stimulated using his herding mouth; tricks and redirection help this young man know the direction his human is asking for. He does focus on balls as he runs and explores things. He is easy on the leash but strong if something catches his interest and is totally excited when we run and play in a few hill hike/bike trails enjoying commands for jogging as well.  Tip is more private about his comfort level for love/petting and is working on this as he does enjoy our fun hugs and makes eye contact.  Tip is looking for an experienced dog person who understands the sensitivities of the Border Collie.  His litter came to my rescue July 4th 2014 at 4 months of age which is a prime life experience for any dog.  Tip overcame a lot of fears and had some imprinting from the owner reaching/grabbing. All the 8 puppies were running free on her 3 acres in Louisiana absorbing all sounds and movements of life, pretty dang scary for young herders.  He is still learning about strangers and how they should approach him for the best positive experience.  He is not suitable for cats or children/grandchildren as he is scared of fast movements and can fear bark. He would benefit from another dog in his home that is on his activity level and enjoy fun BC/Aussie play or play dates with dogs he\u2019s met on leash walks. He crates nicely with a break during a work day, a 6 foot fence is required, and owners that follow his diet as his colon is super sensitive. All of his training/diet have been laid out for the next journey in his life! If an out of area applicant would be a potential match it is required they come to Houston to meet Tip and potentially stay a few days to further the matching process",

A meet n' greet with any companion dog is required. Preferably no cats.We require that you have a fenced in yard, not a \"kennel\" in the yard AND we do not approve underground fencing. Depending upon the dog some exceptions are made for those who live in apartments. We also require that the adoptee will be a part of the family \"living\" within the home.

More specifically, I'm looking for an active home that will give me a job to do. Not like a paying job, mind you! I'm thinking more along the lines of a volunteer job. For example, want to fetch balls? I'm your girl! Want to play frisbee? That's me! How about running? I'm down with that! Want to play hide and seek with treats? I'm all in! You see, I have high energy and drive and need mental and physical exercise to keep me healthy and happy.\n\nOnce I'm done with my \"job\" I settle in for some love and affection. I'm a really good student if you give me consistent training. I already know \"sit\" and am a good treat taker. As a bonus, I seem to like other dogs, with the proper introduction. (You just can't rush finding the right friends -- am I right?)\n\nThink we might be a good match? Call or text The Pet Connection at 913-671-7387 for more information and to set up a meeting with me!\n\nPlease contact The Pet Connection if you can foster, adopt, or sponsor a special needs dog or cat. 913-671-7387 Text.

            "description": "My name is Mikos, and I'm going to take a chance on you! That's because I know someone is out there looking for a \"special\" dog like me. Maybe there's someone who has a 'thing\" for older women or someone who loves the quiet of a senior companion. Or perhaps there is someone who understands getting old isn't for sissies.\n\nThis almost 10-year-old, 55-pound, female Golden Retriever mix has a smile as wide as Moon River and a heart as big as Texas. And Mikos has become a sweet, happy dog under the care of her foster family.\n\nMikos is a regal lady who is house trained (but has occasional accidents due to her age). And this \"golden girl\" is quiet...none of that barking or growling nonsense.\n\nMikos's foster mom can tell you all about Mikos and her age-related limitations. For example, Mikos has arthritis that comes with age. But with pain medication, laser treatments, and dog food specifically for joint improvement, she is doing well. She does need to avoid stairs, but she really enjoys short leash walks.\n\nMikos is the perfect partner for Netflix nights, crafting projects, gardening, sudoku, and culinary creations...just no rock climbing. And by the way, fireworks, thunderstorms, and doorbells don't phase Mikos because she can't hear. Mikos also gets along with everyone, except cats, we aren't sure about cats.\n\nYou can apply to adopt Mikos by completing an online adoption application. Come and meet this \"golden girl.\"\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online at http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.",

He appears to have had NO contact with humans before landing in the shelter. We have been working to gain his trust, and he has made a LOT of progress, but he is still very shy meeting new people.\n\nBandit gets along really well with other dogs, and is very playful. He has learned to walk nicely on a leash, and does well walking on a coupler with another dog. He seems to prefer sleeping in the crate, and will go to bed on his own at the end of the day.\n\nOur hope is that with continued practice, Bandit will become more trusting of humans. He really seems to enjoy it when his foster family pets him and brushes his lovely coat -- he just soaks up the attention as though making up for lost time. We feel sure that Bandit will come around, but it will take a very patient, gentle adopter.\n\nBandit has been neutered, vaccinated, and microchipped, so he is ready to find a forever home. If you are ready to commit to spending at least 3 months earning Bandit's trust, please visit our website to learn more about our adoption process and complete an application: https://www.bluebonnetrescue.org/info/adoption",

If you are serious about adopting, visit our website wbcrescue.org to read more about this dog and our adoption process, and to submit an application. Thanks for considering adoption!\n\nThis is True. He\u2019s an incredibly special little Border Collie. Born with deformed front legs and an irrepressible spirit, his smile can light up a room. True loves nothing more than meeting people and spreading happiness. Being a shop or office dog would probably be his dream come true. He adores kids, is great with other dogs, gets long with cats, potbellied pigs and livestock, and has become a registered therapy dog. He enjoys walks, occasional hikes, and loves toys and the snow. He thinks visiting his foster mom\u2019s brother\u2019s family, with two kids and lots of people coming and going, is fabulously fun. True\u2019s perfect family is out there, and his foster mom will be accepting applications for those who are looking for an incredibly special little guy who brings joy to everyone he meets.

For more information, visit us at www.sheltersurvivors.com\n\nUPDATE:  After taking Meimei to the vet for extensive testing, we were very sad to find out that Meimei is in Stage 3 kidney disease. This was not the prognosis that we were hoping for. Meimei will now go from being a special needs case to a hospice case. Meimei's foster family has committed to keeping her comfortable for as long as possible; Meimei will remain in their care until her journey has ended. We will continue to manage Meimei's disease with prescription food, supplements, and medication. Most of all, we will spoil Meimei with endless love, cuddles, and comfort. She's a special little girl and we are heartbroken over her diagnosis. If you are interested in donating towards Meimei's care, you can do that by going to www.sheltersurvivors.com and clicking on the \"Donate\" button; or by going to the \u201cHow To Help\u201d page to send a donation by mail. Thank you so much for your continued support.\n\nMeimei's story:\nMeet sweet Meimei! She is a Shih Zhu mix and about 8 years old. This 12 pound girl ended up in the shelter when her owner had to move. Meimei was devastated since that was the only home she had ever known. She had been with her person since she was 8 weeks old. Not only was Meimei stressed, she also suffered from allergies and began to lose her hair. When one of our volunteers saw Meimei\u2019s sad little eyes and itchy skin, we knew that Meimei needed our help. After we got Meimei under our care, we found out that Meimei is showing early signs of kidney disease. We are in the process of completing extensive testing to see what stage she is in. We believe we have caught this early so we are hoping that she has many more wonderful years to be the loving and playful girl that we see everyday! The only symptoms she is showing at this point is the need to urinate more often and she can be very thirsty at times. Her appetite is great and she is active and playful! \nAlthough Meimei\u2019s world has been turned upside down, she holds no grudges. She happily greets everyone she meets (men, women, and children). She enjoys going for several walks each day, and she loves snuggling next to her people. Meimei often looks up at her foster mom with her big and round thankful eyes. This look will make your heart melt. When she falls asleep, you will hear this cute little snore. Meimei doesn\u2019t mind spending time in her crate while her foster family is at work. She greets dogs nicely and is fine living with the calm, larger dogs in her foster home.\nWhen we picked Meimei up at the shelter, she had pink and itchy skin. We took her to the vet right away to see what was going on with her. It was determined that she has allergies that simply got out of control. Her ears were extremely infected (which we medicated); she needed medicine for her eyes; she needed allergy medicine, and a few baths a week to help soothe her skin. We noticed such a great improvement the very next day! Her hair is beginning to grow back very nicely. This will likely need to be managed for the rest of Meimei\u2019s life.  And now she also has the kidney disease that also will need to be managed. As long as her new owner pays attention to her medical needs, she should live a happy and fulfilling life.  While Meimei is mostly housebroken, we sometimes use a diaper when she is roaming around at home, just in case she needs to go and we don't see her signal to go out. She is able to make it through the night without a diaper. We only use the diaper if we are preoccupied and can't keep a close eye on her for that moment while we are at home. Through all of this, Meimei has allowed all handling without any problems. She is a trooper! She\u2019s just so happy to be in a home and loved again.\n\n  \nTo adopt Meimei, please complete our online dog application  http://www.sheltersurvivors.com/application.html and return it to sheltersurvivors@live.com. Or go to sheltersurvivors.com , click on the home page, look for \"Application\" at the top of the home page, complete the application and hit the submit button once you have completed the application in its entirety. This will expedite the adoption process. \n",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Please contact Lynn & Cedric (lynnwelcomesyouhome@gmail.com) for more information about this pet. All of our dogs and cats are in foster homes and we have no paid staff. If you have questions concerning a specific animal, PLEASE fill out an application and the foster parent will be in touch. We will not arrange any home visits with any of our dogs and cats until your application is processed. Please understand our foster parents are precious to our 2nd Chance family; without them we cannot function, so we do our best to not burden them with multiple appointments. Our foster parents will choose their top 3 applications and arrange home visits with these applicants. The adopter will be chosen at that time. The process can take anywhere from a week to a month. We want to make sure our little furry ones are placed in their 'forever home' and never have to go through a rehoming again! If \"CUDDLING\" was an Olympic sport - Emma would win \"GOLD\"\nEmma was adopted and lived in her forever home for 2 years. She lived with 2 other dogs without ANY incidents but one day her mom went to work and when she came home one of the dogs had been attacked and even though the vet tried to save it the dog was in shock and had to be given wings.No one witnessed the attack so there is no way of knowing for sure it was Emma but she had blood on her and scratches so it is assumed it was her. Therefore, even though the owner loved her she was not comfortable having her in their home with her other dog so sweet Emma is looking for her new FUREVER home.To be on the safe side we are looking for a home where she can be the only dog. She does well around other dogs at events but for Emmas sake we do not want to put her in a situation again that could go wrong because then she would have to be put down and that would be 'just wrong'. She is so loving and sweet and wants nothing more than to be with 'her person'.\nPlease fill out an adoption application:\nAdoption application (Dog)\nAdoption Application (Cat)\n\nPlease understand we do not adopt out dogs to\nfamilies with children under the age of 5. We do not adopt dogs to renters. Some dogs will have fence requirements while others may not.\n\nA pet is a lifetime commitment. The dogs and cats in our system find themselves there, for the most part, because their humans did not have the same loyalty to them as they did to their owners. We do not take the adoption process lightly, and will do everything in our power to make sure the animal is placed correctly the first time around for your sake and theirs. Thank you for choosing to adopt not shop!",

This vivacious lady loves hiking, long walks (multiple times a day if you'll oblige), and running zoomies between head scratches, sunbathing, and perching on her fort. Her zest for an adventurist life knows no bound!\n\nLaila can be touch sensitive but beneath that wild child exterior, she just wants to be loved and pampered like the queen she is. She was rescued from South LA shelter back in 2018 and has celebrated multiple New Years, Valentine's, Halloweens, Thanksgivings, and Christmases with us. We're hoping this is the year she lands herself an adoring family and warm home to call her own.\n\nLaila is house-trained and crate-trained. We recommend a home without other pets and she would do best with older children (high school age or older).\n\nSEE MORE PICTURES AND VIDEO HERE: https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/ddrlaila/\n\nIf you are interested in Laila, please fill out our brief online questionnaire (copy and paste link):www.downtowndogrescue.org/adoption-questionnaire\n\nAdditional Downtown Dog Rescue contact info: Email:adopt@downtowndogrescue.org or call: 818-407-4145",

Eric's mom is a mix of Weimaraner and Basset Hound mix, Momma Hanna was found pregnant walking down the highway in SC near the Georgia Border and she ended up in the shelter; we don't know who the daddy is to the puppies. Eric however looks and acts very much like Labrador puppy so we suspect he may have some Lab mix in him. \nEric loves other dogs. He has grown up with dogs and is the most comfortable around another dog. He would benefit from a home with a confident dog who can show him around. \nWhile Eric is very playful and loves to wiggle. He can be shy in new situations. He loves yummy treats and is very food motivated. He is active but can easily distract himself with toys. \nEric is ready to find his forever home! \nPlease apply at www.blackjackrescue.org \n\nIf you have any questions please email Rachel@blackjackrescue.org",

            "description": "CLARK IS IN A FOSTER HOME.  \n\nDate of birth: 3/2016\n\n8/17/2020:  Clark is a super cute Hound/Lab mix.  He\u2019s 4 years old and weighs about 60 lbs, Clark is a very friendly guy. He\u2019s sweet natured, energetic and smart.  He likes treats and sits nicely.  He\u2019d be a great companion for an active person and we\u2019d  like to place him in a home with a fenced yard.  He wouldn\u2019t be a good mach for apartment living.  He is house trained.\n\n\u2022 Clark loves kids but he tends to get too rough with them. He'd be fine with teenagers who are comfortable with a fairly large dog who can get rambunctious.\n\nClark is living in a foster home. Here's what his foster mom has to say about him:\n\n\u2022 He is high-energy and needs walks and/or yard playtime every day\n\n\u2022\u00a0Loves to play fetch. Loves toys in general and has taken to hiding and pretend \"burying\" in the house the ones he likes the most to keep them safe.\n\n\u2022 Feels that affection should go both ways and wants to lick your face while he is being petted\n\n\u2022\u00a0Frequently demands belly rubs\n\n\u2022\u00a0Will nap on the couch with you and is an excellent cuddler.\n\n\u2022 Knows sit, is working on \"Off\".\n\n\u2022 Plays rough and is still working on not playbiting and jumping when he gets excited. \n\n\u2022 Follows sun spots around the house to laze in them.\n\n\u2022 Loves being on the couch.\n\n\u2022 Makes the cutest little grunting sounds. We call them his buffalo noises, and he does them when happy or when he wants something.\n\n\u2022 Clark likes most other dogs and wants to play, but he comes on very strong when he meets dogs to play and we've found that most dogs are not happy about that.  If you have a dog we\u2019d ask you to make an appointment to bring your dog in to meet Clark to see if they could be buddies.  \n\n\u2022\u00a0Clark does need a home without cats.\n\nWhen Clark came to us he had some pretty awful wounds on his left leg and shoulder area that needed medical care.  He\u2019s all healed up now and doing fine.  He\u2019s also been neutered, vaccinated, microchipped and tested for heartworms. \n\nMORE ON ADOPTING OUR DOGS... \n\n> COVID-19 UPDATE: PLEASE SUBMIT AN ONLINE ADOPTION APPLICATION AND A MEMBER OF OUR ADOPTIONS TEAM WILL REACH OUT TO YOU. Please visit our web site at HSGKC.ORG for an adoption application, our current COVID-19 adoption protocol, and other adoption info.  \n\n> If you decide you'd like to adopt one of the pets you meet, we reserve the pet for you but we generally don't send the pet home with you that day. We\u2019ll instead schedule a pick up date and time that\u2019s convenient for you.\u00a0  \n\n> Our goal is to send you home with a healthy pet and any information and support you may need to help your new pet adjust to his or her new home.  All of our dogs & puppies have been spayed or neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, treated for fleas & ticks, tested for heartworms (7 mo. and over), and are on monthly heartworm preventative. Puppies who are too young to receive all the necessary puppy boosters and/or first rabies shot may be brought back to us for those vaccines at no extra charge. You will also receive a leash, collar, coupons for pet supplies and services, toys, and educational materials. And we'll give your dog a bath before he or she goes home! \n\n> Please note that we prefer and may require a fenced yard for many of our dogs.  Exceptions are made on an individual basis depending on the dog's needs, the person's dog experience, the dog's and person's activity levels, home environment and other factors. \n\nThank you for searching for a shelter pet!\n\nDog Adoption Contact Info:\nEmail: christine@hsgkc.org\nPhone: 913.596.1000 ext. 113\nhttp://hsgkc.org",

If you are interested in fostering Star, please do also contact us. Star is looking for an adult home to share her amazing smile with! Check out her videos!\n\nFrom Star's dad, \"Star is a great dog and I would love to keep her if my circumstances were different. Without going into details, it is just not in the cards for me to be able to keep her. Everyone that has looked after her for me have loved her and say how great she is.\n\nShe is great on walks, short runs, and hikes. She loves to cuddle and she sleeps in my bed. She sits on command and will come when I call her. She knows 'paw', 'other paw', 'sit', 'lay down' (kinda), 'roll over' (with a lot of treat incentive and some assistance). She is very good about only going to the bathroom outside. What dog doesn't have the occasional accident? She has not chewed or destroyed anything in the house.\n\nShe loves that ice cream for dogs and denta stix. She loves tug-o-war and running around, being chased and just playing. She always has the biggest smile and I will miss her so much.\"\n\nInquire about Star today",

Godiva and her 10 babies were rescued by police after Godiva had given birth under a shed in May 2018. All babies were adopted except for Gage which left him remaining with Godiva - these two must stay together. Gage has never been without his mommy. They are such great dogs and absolutely love playing in the yard together, playing fetch and going on walks. They are affectionate and well behaved as well. They are so fun! Godiva is 2 years old and Gage is just over a year now. Both are vaccinated, spayed and neutered, potty trained and eagerly waiting for a home. We will ask for only one adoption fee for this gorgeous pair! To inquire or meet Godiva and Gage, please contact us at 100PlusAbandonedDogs@gmail.com.\nLocated in Ft Lauderdale\nWe do not ship or transport.",

She is a female German Shephard born November 13, 2017 who is looking for a special family who will work with her megaesogphagus which is a condition that requires her to eat pureed food from sitting up. Dogs with this condition can live long and productive lives and we expect Shadow to as well! She\u2019s friendly with other dogs great with kids and being trained /raised by Mary with Service Peace Warriors. Shadow is a beautiful girl who is very shy but bonds strongly and quickly with 'her people'. \n\nLike all Mikey's Chance dogs, this dog will come to you from a foster home that has provided loving one-on-one attention, socialization and some basic training, as well as quality food and exercise. \n\nApplications can be found at www.mikeyschance.com and completed on a computer, tablet, and/or phone. Please note that adopters are not chosen on a first come, first served basis, but full consideration is given to the best fit for the dog AND the adopter.

Our veterinary partner estimates that Isiah was born in approximately June 2017. Isiah received all of the medical care he required, including removal of the mass, and his neck wounds have since healed. Isiah is\nvery loving and sweet. He is pretty low maintenance and would prefer to just hang out with his family. He gets along with other dogs. Isiah is wary of men and would require very slow introductions.\nIsiah is a great dog, who has certainly lived his life in a most painful way, and deserves only the best moving forward. If you feel you would like to adopt Isiah, please apply online at http://www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org",

He is a little nervous around men but will warm up.  He rides well.  He will need a fenced in yard and another playful dog.  We are working on his housetraining.

If you're in the Seattle / greater Seattle\u00a0area, please keep reading!\u00a0If you have a big heart and love cuddles, I could be the one for you!\u00a0\n\nI am a cute terrier mix and maybe\u00a0Berger Picard (around 10kg and 3.5\u00a0years old)\u00a0and if you take a look into my deep brown eyes and my large muppet ears, you might quickly fall in love. We are looking to keep me in the Seattle / North Seattle area, as I'm really bonded to my foster Mom, and would need a somewhat slow transition. Also, you could think of adopting me as possibly a part time share, my foster Mom would like to stay in my life, help out and dog sit,\u00a0if that would be okay with you. Feel free to reach out for more information if you're truly interested, and you can chat with my current Mama.\u00a0You can contact us through this rescue group or even send my foster Mom a message on my Instagram account - info below.\n\nI was found by some kind people in an abandoned building, paralyzed in all four of my limbs. - Trust me, I'm a survivor!\u00a0\n\nThe good news - I am now in a loving foster home, just North of Seattle, and have had an MRI. My\u00a0c5-c6 is injured, which has caused paralysis in my four limbs.\u00a0My foster mama has done a tremendous amount of work with me to make me stronger.\u00a0 At this point I can not sit, stand or walk by myself and my bladder gets expressed about 4 times a day. I don't wear diapers, and I have a normal 2x daily bowel movement. I'm one of the few paralyzed dogs that doesn't need to wear diapers! It's a good idea to get my urine tested every few months, since paralyzed dogs are prone to UTIs. I've only had one since I arrived a year ago. Since the time I've been in foster care, my whole body has become stronger. Six months after I arrived here, my back legs started to \"wake up,\" it was amazing! I now go on daily walks / tows in my cart (see my videos, or check out my IG account). Once my cart starts to get pulled in a forward motion, my rear legs follow. Sometimes they want to collapse, but my human picks them up a bit and I'm ready to walk again! Currently I walk 1/4-1/2 a mile daily, sometimes more! I can't steer very well, because of my injury I tend to go left quite often.\u00a0I move my front shoulders, but my front paws haven't woke up yet, but they are getting stronger. My days consist of cart walks, park visits, exercises, cuddles and snoozing. Once I get my walk, I'm usually ready for cuddles and a nap. I LOVE to take naps with my human.\n\n\u00a0You may follow along my adventures here, which I now share with my foster sibling who was also rescued from this organization: https://www.instagram.com/rescuedgypsy/\n\nPeople have started a go fund me page to help off set the cost of my rehab, as it has become quite expensive.\u00a0\u00a0http://www.gofundme.com/help-alexi\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI also now have an Amazon.com wish list of my very own!\u00a0https://amzn.to/2I3kT9v\u00a0\n\n\u00a0I always so excited to go outside, and enjoy the fresh air! Sometimes that is in my cart, or my special backpack. Every time my human comes to give me love I do the wiggles and sometimes I sing to her.\n\nI know it will take a special person to give me a forever home, but I believe this world is full of special people. I already found one of them and she's my foster mom. If dreams come true, my next special person is reading this right now and lives close to my foster family!\u00a0I'd love a family who has a nice doggy friend for me, and someone who is home often. I like to be around my humans, in the same room,\u00a0and outside on adventures. My forever human is someone who is physically fit and that will continue.\u00a0If you live near me, my current Mama will go through my routines with you, including my favorite places to visit.\u00a0\n\nI live with two cats, sometimes I'm not bothered by them, but sometimes I growl and bark (can you blame me, I am part terrier).\u00a0I've met some children and do great sometimes.\u00a0Other times I see them and I bark and growl. I do think I'd prefer a home without\u00a0small children, and any older children need to be kind, gentle and patient. Once I know you, and you sit and give me treats for a couple of minutes I earn your trust. When I'm out on my walks in my cart, I very rarely bark, though I will do a high pitch happy bark when I see a dog that peeks my interest! I would thrive to be in a home with another gentle and playful dog. Having another loving dog around really has helped my motivation and my happiness. I am also not neutered and for now need to stay that way.\u00a0I need my hormones to help me get stronger.\u00a0\n\nI\u00a0know it will take a special person to give me a forever home, but I believe you are out there somewhere and\u00a0when we find each other both our lives will grow bigger with love.\n\nCheck out some of my videos!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/fyHxK46lYus\n\nhttps://youtu.be/BTeiM69_0Mc\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Tk-eEaSbTSo\n\nhttps://youtu.be/hFDEZ-8785Q\n\nhttps://youtu.be/EKcn71KzIBU\n\nhttps://youtu.be/sLwFCahPLWw\n\nhttps://youtu.be/H97s9_hU6RM\n\nI have been\u00a0vaccinated and micro chipped.\n\nMy adoption fee is $300.\u00a0\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: It is important for all applicants to visit our website, http://www.lovedatlastdogrescue.ca/adopting/ and read about Loved at Last Dog Rescue.\n\nInformation included in the profile is provided to us from the international rescuer or local fosters.

She is happiest when she is touching her people.\n\nSaiya is housebroken, knows basic commands, is a pleasure to walk!  Sayia is good with other larger dogs but is not a fan of cats, she says they look like squirrels to her. She loves all children, and would love having a family with a fenced yard where she could romp and play.  This girl has a lot of spunk and loves ti roll around to scratch her back in the grass. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adopting Saiya, please visit rescueapittie.org to fill out an online adoption!",

I used to be a house dog so I know how to be good in a house although I  may need some help remembering as I've gotten used to being in a kennel.  I really love cuddling and I want to be the center of the universe, so I need to be the only dog in my family. If you are interested in adopting me, please fill out an application at http://fs22.formsite.com/pbroklahoma/form1/index.html and one of our rescue volunteers will get back with you! Thank you for looking at me!",

He has come along way on leash but needs a confident person to work with him. He is very smart, independent and will love you. He is very playful, loves toys, sticks and tug of war. He is still insecure around strangers which can cause him to lunge or growl therefore he needs to wear a muzzle when meeting new people or attending vet appointments. He has a lot of energy but also loves to cuddle up on the couch with you. He is a very loving happy dog that would make a great addition to a quiet family with dog experience, no young children or animals and willing to work with him",

Unfortunately it has taken me longer to adjust to being with other people.\n\nI was born approximately December 25, 2016\n\nI am approximately 19 pounds, I love walks and could stand to lose a few pounds but who couldn't!\n\nI am standoffish at first but do warm up to my person and love to sit with you, receive love, snuggle under the blanket.\n\nMy Adoption fee includes, I have been fixed, up to date on core vaccines (5 in 1, bordetella & rabies), dewormed and microchipped.\n\nIf Interested PLEASE contact PATCH Rescue Inc. patchrescue@gmail.com or (760) 706-0728\n\nAdopt a Pet Listings =\n\nhttps://www.adoptapet.com/adoption_rescue/93645-patch-rescue-inc-victorville-california\n\nPetFinder Listings =\n\nhttps://www.petfinder.com/member/us/ca/victorville/patch-rescue-inc-ca2487/\n\nAdoption process is verbal interview to determine if we think your family is the right situation for the fur kid you are interested in, application (can be downloaded here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B9ZDmKaRLnYfbDZLbDN5Y3hYeWM?usp=sharing), once application is reviewed and approved home check will be performed. Then we say you are becoming part of the PATCH family adopting one of our fur kids, so we expect follow up on our family member throughout their life, i.e. text, email, social media, pictures are our favorite for sharing with the PATCH family!\n\nPlease keep in mind we are 100% volunteer run We do not have a facility, completely foster based, so we all have our real jobs, it could take 24 to 48 hours to receive a response.\n\nThank you for considering adoption to save two lives!",

We will return to CAL Ranch once deemed safe for the public and our volunteers to do so.  \n\nPongo is about  3  yrs old and weighs about 40  lbs.  He does not like other animals so needs a home where he is king of his castle.  He needs a house with a secure yard, so he can play and pottie in peace without other having to defend his honor.    \n\nHe needs a home with teenagers, no small children (he has never been around them)  He is housebroken and trained.   His previous owner lived in an apartment and could not keep him.  More will be known about me soon.   \n\nA Path 4 Paws holds adoption events EVERY Saturday & Sunday from 10am-4pm at C-A-L Ranch,  located at 232 N. Jones Blvd right off the I-95.   Please bring your dog(s) for a meet and greet (if applicable)  Please bring your entire family so everyone can meet. \n\nIf you are interested in Pongo, please contact dogrescuelv@hotmail.com to confirm the dog you are interested in,  will be attending that particular weekend.  We have limited space at the store, therefore we can not take every dog out to the event.\n\nPongo is spayed/neutered, has current vaccinations and includes a microchip, deworming and 2 free vet visits.  Adoption fee applies.  Please make sure you have read the information listed on the homepage for requirements and restrictions. \n\nFoster homes & volunteers are always needed.  Please contact us regarding how you can help by fostering or volunteering for our organization.",

He was in pretty rough shape. But after much vetting he is all healthy now and is a handsome little gentleman. He is super sweet and low maintenance and perfect in the house. He is blind with cataracts in both eyes. But he gets around fine. He is well tempered and gets along with everyone. I wish that all the minpins were as happy and easy going as him.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please cut and paste the link below to fill out an adoption application:\n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/92916416469165\n\nAfter the application is processed and approved, a home visit and meet and greet with the dogs will be scheduled. If there are any fencing issues, make sure that repairs are done prior to the home visit. MinPins are natural escape artists! Typically, the adoption is finalized the day after the home visit and meet and greet. Out of area adopters would need to drive/fly in to meet the dogs and adopt.",

            "description": "Who wants to adopt a whacky wierdo? HAHA! Belle is a Husky/Herding breed mix who we placed as a puppy. She was returned due to the owner having an illness and could no longer care for her. She has since been placed twice and returned for biting.  Belle has been in her current foster home for about a year and has had zero nipping but she does have some minor issues. Belle is cage aggressive. She is a dog where everything as to be on her terms. She is fearful and panicky when forced to do anything. We will only place her in a dog savvy home that knows how to work with a quirky canine. She seems to show her weirdness when in a new home. Belle is housebroken, vaccinated, spayed, and microchipped. She does not like cats but is very playful with other dogs. Belle is crate trained and would do best with a fenced yard. Belle recently had acl surgery so hiking and a super active family will not work for her. No kids and no cats.\n\nDonations can be available for immediate use if sent to Northeast PA Pet Fund and Rescue via PayPal nepapetfund@gmail.com \n\nAll adoption fees go towards getting the dog up-to-date on all shots, bordetella, spay/neuter, micro-chip, and all vet visits to get them healthy!\n\nPlease text 570-357-8032 for more info or fill out an application on https://nepapetrescue.com/",

Egor had a difficult life before being rescued, we don't know what happened to him, however, he is fearful of people and aggressively protects his space.  Egor was at a high kill shelter when FCSR stepped in to save him.  He was heartworm positive and has been treated for it.  Now, Egor has developed a full cataract in one eye and the other eye is getting cloudy.  He will need to be the only dog.  Egor has a lot of trust issues with people and must be handled at his own pace.  When put in a crate, Egor needs to be left on a leash in order to get him out. If you have experience with Egor's type of behaviors & personality and would like to help him, please complete your application at www.floridacocker.org.

            "description": "Sweet Sunny (DOB June 4, 2011) was turned in because his family couldn't take care of his skin. He is a sweet, quiet boy with really bad skin allergies. He requires an injection once a month from the vet called Cytopoint for environmental allergies ($90), prescription dry-eye drops once or twice a day called Tacrolimus ($60 a bottle) and a prescription anti-itch pill called Apoquel once a day ($59). Then, at intervals, he needs a course of antibiotics and anti-fungal pills for breakthrough skin infections for 3 to 6 weeks at a time. And, of course, as a cocker posatex ear cream for the occasional ear infection. We are looking for a home that has a strong vet history we can confirm and the means and ability to provide this care to Sunny. \nPlease complete your application at www.floridacocker.org.

I love people & attention. I like other dogs but I don't like to share my food or toys with other dogs.  I do have calcified ears; don\u2019t worry it is common for a cocker spaniel to have calcified ears.  Another cocker spaniel trait that I have is a little dry eye (just need some Puralube in my eyes, it only $6-7 a tube) besides that I am healthy.  How about it?  Could I be the boy you are searching for? Please complete your application at www.floridacocker.org. For more details, call 813-245-1833 or contact info@floridacocker.org.",

Bianca is ~6 years old. Her DNA test says she's: Greyhound, Dachshund, Boxer, American Staffordshire Terrier & Rottweiler. She needs to be the only pet in a home & have a strong leader for an owner...with the right owner, she is an easy going, loving & low maintenance girl. Bianca is house broken, spayed, micro-chipped, current on vaccinations, flea and heartworm prevention & has tested negative for heartworm & tick born diseases. Bianca's favorite pastime is riding in the car, so we are thinking that an over-the-road truck driver would be a great fit for Bianca...but not a requirement. We are just looking for the best overall suited owner & home for her. If you are interested in meeting Bianca, please fill out an adoption application on our website at www.apurrfectfit.org",

He was emaciated with cuts and sores on his body. Shortly after, he was placed in the care of ARF. He was nursed back to health, treated for heartworms and is now looking for a forever home. Beau is a good boy that really likes to be with his people. If he's outside; he wants you to be with him or have a companion animal so he's not alone. He has a 'rough and rowdy' style play so his playmate should have the same style play. He is more of a dominant dog and can be overwhelming to a timid companion. He is crate trained and is currently crated when no one is home. Left to wander alone he may choose something to chew on that's inappropriate He does love to tear up stuffed toys. He is up to date on vaccinations, neutered, on heartworm prevention and micro-chipped. His adoption fee is $150. Please fill out our online adoption application at: http://www.animalrescuefriends.org/dog-adoption-application.html (Animal Rescue Friends is primarily based in Arizona with foster homes in Tennessee and Texas.

Below the map is our logo and the link to click on to access adoption forms, contact info or to donate. ALL DONATIONS ARE TAX DEDUCTIBLE.\n\n\nAdoption Fee:  $175.00\n\nZoey Grace is a very sweet but a scared little girl.  She is 12 years old and weighs 9.11 pounds. \n \nZoey Grace is painfully shy, frightened and scares easily, so because of her actions, we believe she has gone thru some sort of trauma both physically and mentally.  Anyone adopting Zoey Grace will have to be patient with her and be willing to give her time to adjust, even if it means months of love and care, if not years.  She has been in rescue for 2 years and is still trying to learn to trust.  Her veterinarian described her as being \"scared of the world\".\n \nZoey is not house trained and is the reason why she was surrendered. She was not able to be house trained,and she will pee in the bed and also in her doggie bed..  She may need to wear diapers (she does not currently wear them so she may not want to), depending on how a new pet parent will be with her lack of house manners, and she eats her poop, called Coprophagia. There is no cure for this habit.  There are a lot of \"home remedies\" that people will suggest but none really work. \n\nShe does not walk on a leash,and will hug the ground and is considered a flight risk, so we will require that there be a secure fenced yard for her safety.\n\nBecause of her extreme behavior of being scared, SCMR will require applicants to have a veterinarian reference that will be able to confirm that she will be well cared for and loved for who she is.\n \nAlso, she is an alpha dog. She gets along with some dogs but will fight and dominate female dogs.  There are no cats in the foster home so it is unknown how she would be around them\n\nPlease know that Zoey Grace is doing well. She is loved and well cared for in her foster home and is happy in Gainesville, FL\n\n\nNOTE: SCMR DOES NOT adopt to homes with children under the age of 10 years or homes with Electric Fences\n\nOut-of-state adoptions are possible; however, the approved adoptive home is responsible for making the necessary arrangements to pick up their new little one.",

He was returned to rescue December 27th, 2017 after he became paralyzed and was diagnosed with Intervertebral Disc Disease (IVDD). Nico weighs 18 pounds and is a happy little guy who is loving life and isn\u2019t phased by the fact he can\u2019t walk. He is currently receiving chiropratic and acupuncture treatments and taking a couple herbal supplements for his IVDD. He loves going for car rides and taking walks in the neighborhood in his set of wheels which will go with him when he is adopted.  He prefers not to use the wheels at home as he can get around very well without them. Nico can stand and has taken a few steps on his own! His foster mom expresses his bladder a few times a day. Don\u2019t let this scare you as it\u2019s very easy to learn and Nico doesn\u2019t mind it at all. He does wear a belly band when he\u2019s scooting around the house to help with accidents. Nico gets along with most dogs and cats but will chase a cat if they run as he thinks they are playing. He enjoys playing with other dogs and is constantly trying to get his foster fur siblings to play with him. He can be a little stubborn and slow to trust, but he loves to be with his foster mom, shower her with kisses, and follow her everywhere. Nico is looking for a patient, loving family that will continue with his treatment plan and love him regardless if he\u2019s able to walk again. He is current on vaccinations, neutered, and microchipped. His adoption fee is $225.00. If you are interested in adopting Nico please visit our website at www.revolutionrescue.com and complete an application and someone will be in touch.",

Oh... we almost forgot... super handsome!!!! \nBjorn is a strong happy boy that requires a strong happy man or woman.  This guy is super smart and eager to please and to learn more.  He knows quite a few commands and corrects easily on the leash.  He loves your lap despite his size... he thinks he's a poodle!!!\nHe cannot go to a home with cats, small dogs or small kids.  He is dog selective so it is best that he goes to a home without other dogs.  He deserves a families undivided attention!\nBjorn is an amazing boy that will fill your heart with love, fill your face with kisses and put a smile on your face everyday. Even if he is the only pet in the home.... he will give you all the love you need!!\nIf you think you can open your heart and home to this goofy love bug... please fill out an adoption application at: \n                             www.dawghous.com\nThank You! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

He is very friendly with children and people. Stitch does well with most female dogs and some male dogs. He is active and loves to play all day. He needs to be in an air conditioning, indoor environment because he is light & heat sensitive. Stitch has one incurable flaw, non-stops barking. Barks at any noise, movement, and then barks at the barking. He is not suitable for an apartment and needs a home with enough distance to the neighbors not to bother them with barking.  \n\nPlease help us find this wonderful dog a forever home with their own family.\n\nAdoption donation fee and home inspection required.\nApplication for adopting and fostering - https://form.jotform.com/201328449376157\n\nThank you, \nDharma DOG Movement\nAwareness | Advocacy | Saving Lives\n\nIf you have any questions about fostering or adopting, please email for application: adopt@dharmadogmovement.org\n \n10/20\n",

Percy weighs 47 pounds and stands 21 inches at the shoulders now with just a little more growing and some filling out to do. Her previous owners got her as a small pup, they live in a mobile home park and Percy has out-grown the space they have for her. She is also a really high-energy girl who needs room to run and an active owner willing to give her the love, good-quality human companionship, playtime, exercise and training necessary for Percy to reach her full potential. Percy is a beautiful girl, very loving and is searching for her pack leader. She could be a good running companion, hiking dog, possibly a good dog to get involved in a dog sport - anything that will gives her exercise, your companionship and gives her a purpose. When Percy is thoroughly settled in her new Forever home, she will benefit from positive basic obedience training to help with leash training and the bonding process. Once Percy has bonded with her new owner, she will make a most loyal canine companion. She is crate trained. For more information on Percy, please call Sandy at tele # 661-824-4495 (this is a land-line phone).\n\nPercy doesn't come to Petco or A Better Way Pet Care. She can be seen at the rescue by calling Suzanne Poth at 661-824-4393 to make arrangements.\n\nPercy does not do well with other animals and requires a very experienced handler.\nWe believe Percy would be best in a home with no kids under the age of 10 years.",

Of course, that would require them to give me a bath afterwards, since my white fur would become green with grass stains! I am full of curiosity and would run around all day to search for the next best stick or ball! I am quite the explorer! For this reason, I would benefit from having a family with a great fenced in backyard. \n\nI do not do well with small dogs, cats or little children. But I would love to play with any child over the age of 10 who can handle my silly antics and not mind being knocked down occasionally when I'm running around. \n\nI am also quite smart, so if you would like to play chess, Settlers of Catan, or do a science experiment, count me in as your partner in crime! \n\nI am about three years old, so have a lot of life ahead! I hope it is with you! \n\n",

            "description": "Felix is a 4 year old, 15 pound tan beagle mix. He is one of a large group of similar dogs we got together who were not socialized to people. All are shy, but most haven't been aggressive. Most have now been adopted- just Felix and Shirley Bassey are left.\nFelix is now to a point where he seems to about to have a breakthrough in overcoming his shyness. He loves other dogs, even big ones. He used to be great playmates with a big hound we had. He has gotten to be comfortable at taking treats out of volunteers' hands, and he is also good at going in and out of his kennel for exercise time. One volunteer was even able to get him to walk on a leash a little.\nHe will still need a home that is patient with him. His people will have to make sure he can't run out the front door or escape the yard.\nNeutered, has a chip, and all his shots.\nPlease find our applications and valuable information under 'Adopt a dog'* on our website: *www.beaglesandbuddies.com* and email your application to beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Let us know your preference of appointment day/time and which dogs you are interested in and we will do our best to accommodate and email you the closest appointment available. Please allow us up to a week to get back to you. Most appointments will be Friday-Sunday, 10 am - 2 pm, for an hour.\n*Note bring any other dog/s and the entire family to your meet and greet at B&B.* A complimentary training manual is included with each adoption, authored by terristeuben.com. Check out her website - she is fabulous!\nB&B is glad to be open during the pandemic. We know the value and comfort of a loving pet companion and are doing our best to help the dogs and folks who need them. We update our website daily and are always rescuing, vetting, rehabilitating, socializing.\n* We are accepting applications for volunteers to spend time with our dogs, hang out, sing/read to the shy ones, walk/toss ball with those who go to the playgrounds; cleaning, office work, gardening, and building/repair projects! *\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment. Please look at our website and make a list of one or more dogs that you would like to see.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf you have a question about adopting, giving up a dog, boarding, or volunteering, please visit the appropriate tabs on our\nhome page.\n\nFor more specific questions, call 626-444-9664 (please leave a voicemail if no answer) or email at beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Note that\nEmailing\nis always preferred!\n\nThanks!\n\nPlease note: If you are viewing this profile anywhere other than Beagles & Buddies own website, you are not receiving full info.

He prefers to hang by himself and loves to be around his special people. Wookie has a strong voice that sounds bigger than he is. Although he will occasionally play a little with other dogs at his Foster Home, he is generally a little picky about most dogs and does not like to share. He is not cat friendly and isn't really a fan of smaller dogs. Wookie isn't high on energy but will play with a tennis ball and LOVES stuffed animals to tear apart and carry around - Wookie also loves to watch TV and hang with the family for quiet snuggling on the couch or spend time hanging outside on a patio. Wookie loves car rides but will need help if he needs to jump up into a higher vehicle.\n\nOriginally it was reported that Wookie was deaf, this is unlikely, we think he just had a strong case of husky selective hearing!",

This handsome boy is so full of love and he's eager to share it. I believe that Blue is convinced he's a teeny, tiny lap dog. When he wants attention he's not pushy, he simply puts his head on your shoulder or in your lap, sometimes he'll put his paw on your leg.\nBlue's a very smart dog and the expression on his face when being talked to leads me to believe he understands what I'm saying. Once proper introductions are made he's very good with other dogs. He is kind of a silly klutz, known to run right into the wall or trip easily over himself. I feel he will flourish in a home where he has a lot of space with a backyard. He's good-natured and obedient, does great at the dog park and walks well on a leash. Blue complies to all basic commands...sit, stay, stop, come, no. When his kennel is available he'll relax inside it but he doesn't have to be confined to a kennel, he's fully potty trained as long as he's taken out. Has he has a strong curiosity toward cats but doesn't show any signs of aggression or violence. Blue doesn't bark a lot. I think he reserves his voice for when strangers approach the house or sometimes he'll bark playfully when he wants attention. He has a lot of energy but is also content sitting with you while you read or watch TV. If you let him he'll snuggle right up with you to go to sleep. Basically he's just a big ole friendly lug who offers a lifetime of devotion, friendship and love.\n\n10/13/20 12:00 PM",

When I was a stray I would jump over a 4-foot fence to play with a female Pit Bull, so people started calling me her boyfriend. \n\nI'm friendly with all ages, but due to my size and strength I would do best in a home with children at least 8 years old. As you can tell by my photos my favorite thing is to play with a ball, especially if someone throws it for me! \n\nI've been living outside, but would love to be an inside pet where I can be a constant, loving companion. Did you know that dogs who have lived outdoors are easily house trained, because we know that is where we do our business? \n\nIf you would like to meet me in person please contact Giles County Humane by calling or sending them an email. \n(rcw)\n",

I'm new to this learning sign language and what my teachers are trying to get from me but give me time- i'm going to figure it out!\nI'm a rather large boy, just shy of 75lbs...and I have been known to forget how big I am when i'm playing with other animals. At my foster home, there's a few horses that i'm no longer to hang out with since I keep nipping their legs to try to get them to pay attention to me. Other dogs, I have been known to be rather rambunctious with so a home with a dog that can handle that would be best. Also, because of my lack of size knowledge, it is not recommended that I go to a home with cats or any other small animals because I could unintentionally hurt them when all I mean to do is play. I'm just an enormous puppy!\nMy foster says i'm very sweet & once i trust you, i'm extremely loyal & my goofy personality comes out.\nI have gotten a little anxious when my humans leave me alone, but a bone filled with peanut butter usually does the trick at keeping me occupied for awhile. \nFor the first week & a half of being in my new foster home I was nervous & would cry whenever I couldn't see her but have since calmed enough that i'm ok for about 4 hours alone or about 6 hours with another dog to keep me company.\n\n*Transport to any approved home within the US is provided at no additional cost. \nCurrently Groot is located in Snohomish, Washington\n\n*Please visit SNARRANIMALRESCUE.org to check out our adoption requirements/process and to fill out an application!",

At the sanctuary where I have lived for 8 months, I enjoy running and playing and I have been around several of my kind (huskies) and other kinds of dogs as well.  I have had time to get my joy back and I just love my humans.

I came to TIRR Rescue from Houston, where I was a street dog.\n\nI lived in a couple of foster homes, but I am an excellent escape artist and it was very hard for my foster and rescue people to catch me.  I became what they call a \"flight risk,\" so I can no longer be left alone in a yard at all.\n\nBecause of my time on the streets, I am very distrustful of humans.  I don't so much fear them as just simply not trust them.  I am ok with kids - their words and actions don't conflict like with so many adults.\n\nHowever, I am slowly learning to trust my rescue people, and my roommate Buccee has helped me gain confidence in humans.\n",

            "description": "Poor sweet Mona ( 3 year old female Chihuahua mix)has been with us for a year now. She is shy in the beginning when meeting you.  She also extremely fearful of men. With time she will learn to trust you and be your faithful companion who will be next to you and clean your face with kisses daily.  Because of her rough life before rescue she has a trust issue at first.  But well worth watching her blossom with love.  She would do best in a home with a fenced in yard and no children. For more information please email freetobemerescue@gmail.com or call 518-956-1804.  You can also go online to freetobemerescue.org to submit an application online.  \nPlease be advised we only process applications within an hour drive of Albany,NY.  Adoption fee $300.00.",

He likes lots of attention, belly rubs and taking naps.  He is quiet and does not bark when inside with people. His dislike is being cooped up inside a kennel when his people leave.  He is housebroken but has a tendency to chew on toys left out by our children.  Jasper does not need lots of space to run outside or very much exercise.  He does well off leash in our yard (no fence)  but is most happy being inside on a soft bed next to me in my office.  He would make a great pet for someone who spends a lot of time at home, wants some ears to scratch and an occasional walk around the block.  \n\nFor more information on Jasper please visit www.makrescue.org and fill out an adoption application.\nJasper is located in St. Louis",

            "description": "Jango is practically the definition of \"overlooked\" at FOHA, and his extended tenure at the shelter is truly a mystery to those who know him. Despite how handsome he is, he has been known to not show well in his run, often lowering his head and looking uninvitingly at passersby. This, however, is no indication of his true disposition: Jango is sensitive, playful, well-behaved, and affectionate. He is also a deeply loyal companion who bonds strongly with his family. He can thus be protective, so care should be taken in introducing him to strangers coming into his home. Jango can be selective about the canine company he keeps, but he has gotten along with many dogs when he is properly introduced. Though he's not a puppy anymore, he still has a lot of energy and loves his walks and time chasing toys in the play yard. Smart, attentive, and food-motivated, Jango knows \"Sit\" and will likely be easily trainable. If you're ready to bestow upon him the time, care, and attention Jango needs, he will reward you with unending loyalty and companionship!Jango would do best in a home with children over 15 and as an only dog.This dog can only be adopted within the Washington DC metro area",

Even as a senior, she will be an exceptional companion in the right home: This means a household with no other dogs, no cats and no small children.  What we have found through rehoming efforts with her is: 1) while she has been tolerant of dogs in a social sphere, Peanut will not share a home with them; 2) now that she is older, her patience for young children has flown and she will not be adopted out to a household with small children or where little kids frequently visit; 3) Peanut will require leashed activity and a secure fence.",

            "description": "Tucker is a little over 5 years old and sadly hasn't had much exposure to life outside of a shelter. He was a transfer in from another facility. When he first arrived at CHS he wasn't much for being handled by humans. He was very scared and very shy, it has taken him several months to settle in and now he is doing great. He is a very tolerant dog and he does well in playgroup. We don't feel that he is going to do well with small kids, as he is very rough and tumble when he plays and he has no idea that he is about 75lbs. He thinks its fun to run into you while he is playing. Tucker is going to need a patient home with lots of understanding of positive reinforcement training in order to make him feel comfortable. An only dog situation for this kid would be preferred. If you feel that you might be able to provide Tucker with what he is looking for that would be great. Please don't hesitate to contact us. CHS is very committed to our adopters getting the best possible adoption experience that they can. Due to that we ask that prior to arrival at the shelter you please call 503-397-4353 or email animalwelfare@columbiahumane.org to make appropriate arrangements. Most of our dog adoptions are done by appointment only, as we have very limited staff and we want to be able to give ample time to our adopters. They deserve that as well as our dogs deserve it.For more information call 503-397-4353 or email animalwelfare@columbiahumbia.org",

Does the spot on the couch or bed next to you feel a little too empty, or perhaps there is a spot right between you and your family members that needs to be filled by the love of a sweet and devoted dog who is so deserving of your love, and will return it 100 fold! Did you answer yes to any of these questions? Then Gracie is your girl! Gracie is about 8 years old and as you can see, they haven't been an easy 8 years. She was rescued from death's door by a concerned citizen who kept her safe and helped her put on weight. We don't know what she went through, but she's come out the other side in true pittie fashion, with only love to give! As is the case with princesses, there is only room for one, and Gracie needs to be your only pet, but she has the love of 10 to give you, so you won't need any more, as she will fill up the house with love. Apply to adopt Gracie at www.pbroklahoma.com. Her adoption donation is $150.",

Seems he loves being in a home and is absolutely no trouble. Don't let the skin condition around his eyes deter you from meeting this sweet boy. The eye meds we use every day and the special food for allergies keeps the condition under control. He loves playing with his people - staff call him 'a silly boy' as he tries so hard to get you to rough house and play with him. He doesn't want to share your attention and so would prefer to be the only pet in the home. Macho loves going on car rides and walks well on a leash.\nMacho is estimated to be 10 years old and weighs approximately 55 lbs. This boy would LOVE, LOVE, LOVE a family to call his own. For an appointment to meet him, please email adoptions@satchelslastresort.org or call 941-924-5070.",

It all started back in Creek County Oklahoma. My brother Pecos and I were stray dogs, I won't get into how all that came about as I assume you don't have all day. Anyway, we were doing what we could to get by, and I'm not going to lie to you, we were getting into some trouble, and people didn't like it. You know, knocking over trash cans, chasing people's chickens... stuff like that. But then we made a friend! A kind old man who lived all by himself felt sorry for us and started feeding us. He was a really good guy and we loved him. Then one day, we heard a neighbor, a really unpleasant guy, yelling at our friend, \"STOP FEEDING THOSE DAMNED DOGS! IF YOU DON'T GET RID OF THOSE DAMNED DOGS I'M GOING TO GET RID OF THEM FOR YOU!\" Well, he was being mean to our friend and we didn't like that one bit, so we went over there to see what was going on. But before we knew what happened, that angry man came after us with a piece of pipe! He smashed Pecos across the face with it and then he whacked ME! It really hurt, he broke my face! My jaw was cracked and dislocated, I couldn't move my mouth, and Pecos was even worse, he was bleeding all over the place! We didn't know what else to do but run! If we gave him the chance to hit us again he would have killed us! Before we could even figure out what we were going to do to help our friend, we were being chased by the authorities! Someone must have called them and blamed the whole thing on us! They caught up to us, trapped us, and then threw us in the slammer. It was horrible, we couldn't eat or drink or sleep, it just hurt so bad. Then, something amazing happened. Some really kind people, \"The Animal People\", got us out of there. All the dogs on the streets and in the pounds talk about The Animal People, but none of them really believe they exist. Well, Pecos and I know... THEY DO! Anyway, they got us all fixed up and brought us to New Jersey so they could find homes for us. And that's my story!\n\nYou might be thinking, \"Any dog that's been treated that badly would never trust people again.\" I'll tell you this, nothing could be further from the truth! I think people are Angels and I want one for my very own!\n\nWill you be my beloved person?\n\nYours,\n~ Cali\n\nPLEASE NOTE:  Cali does best with another similar-sized male dog.  CALI is not a friend of cats and cannot be placed in a home with them. She would not do well with small dogs either. \n\nWHAT'S NEXT?\n\nIf you would like to meet, foster, or adopt this pet, please fill out our online FOSTER/ADOPTION APPLICATION which can be found in the main menu of our website or at the bottom of this page - simply copy and paste the link into your browser. EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs.\n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

She belonged to a military veteran, struggling with his mental health. Moxie is deaf. He had her trained on a shock collar, but he let her off leash and would shock her at a high level until she cried in order to find her location. This poor man who served our country and was unable to take care of himself let alone a dog so Moxie ended up at Animal Control.\n\nABOUT MOXIE\n\nDue to her deafness, Moxie does startle if she cannot see you coming, however she is extremely loving. Moxie adores people and is getting all the TLC she needs in foster care. She is housebroken and crate-trained. She is an active girl who loves to chase a Kong and play fetch. Sometimes when she runs, she throws both legs back at the same time and looks like a bunny! Although she is deaf, she already knows sit, down, kennel-up, and fetch as she is food-motivated and really wants to make her people happy. She knows how to fetch and doesn't mind people taking the ball away from her. Once she burns off some energy, Moxie is happy to cuddle and is incredibly sweet. Moxie would LOVE a forever family that can show her the joys of being surrounded by love and stability. She needs someone patient and willing to work with her as learning takes longer due to her hearing loss. She might be okay with a calm canine companion her size or larger as well as she occasionally gets to play with two large male dogs at the Pit Bull Palace, although slow introductions are necessary as she can be picky about her dog friends.\n\nPhoto Album of Moxie: https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1843166589074832&type=1&l=37a435a9ac\n\nOur adoption fee is $300.

            "description": "Me, your forever best friend? I would have to be the luckiest dog in the world! I am Ritter! I am an 80 pound, four year old,  sweet boy who loves to cuddle with my people. I love running outside for a little bit every day, so I need a fenced backyard. I am very intelligent, I am crate trained, potty trained and know basic commands. I do well on my leash, I pull a little at the beginning of the walk but I can't help it, I'm excited to hang out with you. I do not want to live with any other dogs. I do well with older, respectful kids. I need a family that will take me for walks in a quiet neighborhood. My favorite things in the world are belly rubs so my only requirements for my forever home are love and belly scratches.  I recently had an issue with my eyes which left me needing them removed so I am getting used to life without sight.  I am adapting very well but need a calm, predictable home and a solid routine in order to flourish.   If you're looking for a buddy who just loves to hang out with you, then I\u2019m your guy!\n\n*I am a graduate of the Pups for Parole training program. I now have all the basic training necessary to make a great companion. I will need a family willing to continue my training, I sure don't want to forget all that I have learned!*\n\nMy adoption fee is sponsored and includes my spay/neuter, vaccinations, wellness exam, heartworm test, and microchip! If you're interested in meeting/adopting me, please visit www.rescueonespringfield.com/our-adoption-process/adoption-application/ and fill out the form! We do adopt out of state with vet references and video home check. *Adopter is responsible for coming to get the dog and returning the dog if they adoption does not work out*",

Both are sweet and loving and enjoy the company of other dogs and people.

As Winnie the Pooh's Eeyore says, \"It never hurts to keep looking for sunshine!\" and that's what our big guy does as he keeps hope alive for his furever family. He is now in good health and other than his hair looking a little thin, there is nothing to worry about when it comes to his hair! Eeyore is good with female dogs and loves people. We never recommend our adult dogs for homes with cats unless we know for sure that they have lived with them in the past. Apply to adopt at www.pbroklahoma.com. His adoption donation is $150",

Now he is safe and healthy and looking for a family of his own. Prefers some room to run. He has been in rescue for 6 years waiting for his forever home. Will you end his search?",

He has settled into our Pathway family and while he can be a little shy with new people, he warms up and loves everyone. And as most huskies, he is super smart. He walks well on leash, loves to go on walks and is well-behaved on car rides. Zai can be a bit picky with canine friendsand does beat with older, calmer female dogs and would also need an adult home or a home with older children. He would do best in a home with strong husky experience \nZai knows the sit and shake command! He is a smart and good boy!\n\nIf you are interested please fill out an application which you can find at www.apathwaytohope.org",

            "description": "Hello.  My name is Brandi.  I have been at TIRR Rescue since 2017.\n\nI came to TIRR Rescue from a breeder, but I never provided puppies to sell.  Perhaps this is why I don't like meeting new people or dogs.  I choose those whom I will trust carefully and do so in my own time.  For a while after I arrived at TIRR Rescue, I didn't spend time with any other dogs.  However, I am better adjusted now and tolerate some of the other dogs here.\n\nI am very protective and territorial.  Once I decide you are my person, I will be completely loyal and trustworthy.  However, though I will be ok with people that I live with, I will never be ok with strangers or \"intermittents\" (frequent visitors).  I will need to be crated whenever there are visitors, because I can be snappy, and I will bite.\n\nI will need a very unique person (or possibly even a couple) who will understand my unique personality and can handle me.  My adopter will need to be a strong leader.  If you think you are that person, be sure to contact my rescue people!\n\n~~~~\n\nPERSONALITY:\nBrandi is a very unique dog with a very unique personality.  She was never socialized and, as such, does not do well with strangers.  She will do best in a home with one person (or perhaps two people) who understand her temperament.  When she decides who her person is, she is very loyal and very protective.  Her adopter will need to understand this and handle her appropriately when other are around.  It is very important that Brandi is set up for success, meaning she is not put in a situation where she will bite; she cannot be allowed around anyone other than the people with whom she lives.\n\n~~~~\n\nTo learn more about Brandi, please visit tirrrescue.org/brandi.",

Sometimes, if you reach out to me, I will sniff your hand, but I do not like to be touched just yet.  However, if your back is turned and you are doing something that keeps your attention off me, I will come up behind you and sniff you, push my nose against your legs, and start to get playful.\n\nI am going to need a very structured and quiet home.  My people will have to give me lots of love and have lots of patience, but the time will be rewarded.",

When she was rescue she was only 10 weeks old. I can\u2019t never understand why people threw away these babies like they are a piece of trash. \nDottie is full of life, love to play outside when it is nice outside and sleeping on her comfy bed. Her Foster Mom says she is very sweet and a totally love attention you are giving her. Her day consists of lounging, chasing squirrels, and then relaxing in the sun. She loves to cuddle under the covers and is happiest when she is touching her human. She is fine with other dogs but would do well as an only dog too. \n\nIF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN DOTTIE PLEASE CONTACT CELESTINE AT 832-659-2576.\n\n",

She loves to play with toys and a ball outside. She is house trained and crate trained as she does not have accidents in her kennel.\n\nAmora is a friendly and well adjusted girl, loves people once she get to know them and wants to be the Queen of the house. She is energetic and would love to live in an active home, playing in a fenced in yard chasing lizards and sunbathing. Amora is absolutely beautiful her pretty red coloring glistens when she is in the sunshine. Walks well on a leash and enjoys touring the neighborhood.\nAmora was a mommy dog and all of her babies have then since been adopted and now she is patiently waiting for someone to love her as much as we do!",

He is pretty good on a leash and enjoys walks/runs. Dodger gets along well with most other dogs. He does need good proper introductions so he does not feel threatened. He loves playing tug of war and with balls. He is a funny guy, he would never turn down a good run but also has been guilty of enjoying a nap on the couch. He is a very sweet dog. Cars are his jam though! A ride in one may be his favorite thing. Dodger will bark and desperately try to get to the other vehicle. We are hoping this sweet pup will find a wonderful forever home that will spoil him rotten was as deserved. He needs a home with a large fenced yard. \nContact crystal@hartmanshaven.org",

            "description": "*Diego's adoption fee has been WAIVED if you are approved to adopt!*\n\nDiego\n\nBreed: Boxer, Shepherd mix \nHousetrained: Completely housetrained\nCompatibility with other animals: Best as the only pet\nCompatibility with children: Best in a home with no children or children visitors \nKnows: Sit, shake, stay, touch, go-to-place\nPreferred home environment: Fenced-in yard required\nIntake date/origin: August 2015, transfer from an overcrowded shelter\nVetting: Already neutered, microchipped, and UTD on vaccines including rabies\nAdoption fee: SPONSORED BY A GENEROUS SUPPORTER\nLocation: Shelter facility\n\nMeet handsome, independent Diego. This guy is an amazing dog for the right person. What do we mean by amazing? Well, Diego can pretty much take care of himself \u2013 he is content just to play by himself and find the comfiest couch to lounge upon. Born in 2014, Diego hasn\u2019t come across the right person yet, but we\u2019re hopeful that there\u2019s someone out there for him.\n\nThe right home for Diego consists of one person who wants a dog just to have the company of a four-legged friend. Ideally, this person would let Diego peacefully exist in the home and provide him with a few toys and access to a fenced-in backyard. While Diego does enjoy a back scratch here and there and an occasional \u201cgood boy,\u201d he really prefers to be left by himself most of the time. He also does not appreciate being restrained, making it very difficult to put a collar or leash onto him, so this is why he must have a fenced-in yard.\n\nDiego has befriended many other dogs here at the shelter. However, he can be possessive of his food, toys, and anything he claims as his (such as the couch), so he must be the only pet in a home with no children. On the plus side, Diego is completely housetrained, he knows an array of cues, and he is a highly-trainable dog.\n\nDiego has been neutered, vaccinated, and microchipped. If you are interested in adopting Diego, please fill out an adoption application for him at www.lovingheartanimalshelter.org/adopt.\n\nWill you be the person to love Diego and give him a chance at a home?",

She was heartworm positive, but is now negative.  She can be with other dogs for play groups, but we do not leave her unattended with others. She is very athletic and had to have a knee (cruciate) surgically repaired shortly after arriving at HH.

So we are looking for a family with very specific requirements to enable her to successfully settle into a new home, one in which she can learn and grow.  Here is what Amber needs:\n\n*       A securely fenced yard (she can jump)\n*       An adult only home \n*       She would be the only dog in the family\n*       A family with experience training a dog\n*       An active family with the patience to work with a young dog\n\nAs you might imagine, we have been overwhelmed with inquiries about her.\nIf you feel your family could provide a good home for Amber and are able to\nmeet her needs as we've described here, please respond to this email so we\ncan reach out to you.  We love Amber and want the best for her.  \n\n\n",

            "description": "Ida is part of the Forever Loved Program. The Forever Loved Program is geared toward pets who have medical issues, behavioral issues, or who are older age or hospice cases. Pets in this program will be adopted out as a forever foster. Our program will provide for all medical needs (such as specialty foods, medicine, and/or vetrinary care) for the rest of the pets life. The Forever Loved program is only available to residents of Alabama. ***Ida is part of the forever loved program due to congestive heart failure. Ida is currently on three pills twice a day to help her heart function better and to keep excess fluid from building up in her system. Ida is considered a hospice case due to this.***\n\nAll dogs adopted through Troy Animal Rescue Project are up to date on vaccinations, spayed/neutered (age appropriate), and heartworm negative. All dogs are given monthly flea/tick preventative, monthly heartworm preventative, and are dewormed regularly. Dogs adopted through Troy Animal Rescue Project are microchipped. Adoption fee is $50. Home visit and vet reference required. Applications can be put in online at http://www.troyanimalrescueproject.org/adopt.php or in person at our rescue center.\n\nThe address for our rescue center is 34 County Road 2266, Brundidge, AL 36010. We are one turn off Hwy 167. If you use Google maps, type in Troy Animal Rescue Project and it will take you right to us. Hours of operation are from 10-3 daily. We are open Saturdays and Sundays. No appointment necessary for pets that are located at the rescue center. Appointments must be made to visit pets in foster homes. Location information will be listed beside the pets name if they are at a location other than our rescue center.\n\nQuestions can be emailed to troyanimalrescueproject@gmail.com or call 334-508-2367.",

Grainger is a very tall, lean boy with plenty of energy. He is very friendly and bouncy and likes people. We are not recommending him for small children only because he tends to be mouthy when he is very excited. He loves attention and is really looking for that special someone with whom to bond. Grainger is not aggressive with other dogs, but he is pushy and we have found that other dogs tend not to like to interact with him, so he would probably be best as an only dog. Grainger is crate trained and he is good off-leash. Grainger was born in September of 2014.",

She will go and greet each one everyday in her cart. Despite having only two legs, she would play fetch all day long if she could. She is also our little mermaid, summer time she thinks swimming all day every day is her job. \n\nNoah's Arks Rescue is all about giving an Abused Animal a second chance at life and to experience what true love is. We take animals that have been tortured, abused, and neglected and supply the emergency medical care required to get them well. We then provide rehab physically and mentally to prepare them for their new home and new life. We are located in Ridgeland, SC., and are by appointment only. All of our dogs are at our Rehabilitation Center either in hospice care or being loved on by staff until we find them forever homes. Please call 843.540.6755 or email NoahsArksRescues@mac.com with any questions. If you are interested, please fill out our Adoption Application at https://www.noahs-arks.net/nar-application.

Hosmer is a 3 year old pit bull mix that was left behind when his owners were evicted. He had a very serious skin infection that has now healed but he does have some allergies that are being managed with the right food and medications. Hosmer is still learning manners but he is working really hard and will do anything for a treat. He is fostered with others dogs and does well, especially with small dogs but he is still learning how to play nice and share. Hosmer will need a home that understands his breed and will be firm but understanding and patient. He is very energetic and is learning how to walk better on a leash but he loves car rides and is a fantastic co-pilot. Hosmer is also very vocal when he plays and when he is expressing his feelings and his foster mom says he is the best cuddle bug when he is tired. He does well with kids but he is still learning how big he is and he is unfortunately allergic to cats! If you are looking for a quirky, energetic furry family member than Hosmer is your guy!",

She is fun, active, and loves to play. \n\nShe does not do well with other dogs, and she thinks cats are toys, so she would do best in a home where she can be the only fur-baby!\n\nFillie loves to play ball, run, and spend time with her person.  She would be a great fit for an active adult, or a family with older kids.  Fillie would be a fantastic work-out partner, or a companion for hikes, bikes, and runs!

            "description": "Hi everyone, Shane here! I am looking for a home and the special people in my life told me I needed to introduce myself to you in order to find one. So let me tell you all the things I love. I love people and attention, and I love to play. I like to run around the play yard and occasionally I forget to hit my brakes in time and I run into my human. But I run right over and crawl into their lap to make sure they\u2019re okay! Belly rubs are great, and of course, I really like mealtime! I love to play with other friendly dogs, and I don\u2019t mind sharing my space with a cat. There are a few things I don\u2019t like. I really don\u2019t like fireworks, or thunderstorms - they scare me, and I need my human to comfort me and calm me. And, well, I hate to admit this, but I can get jealous if my human is paying attention to another dog besides me. I guess I can get a bit possessive of my humans, but I\u2019m working on sharing. I also do not like when someone tries to steal my special treasures...finders keepers and all that stuff. I like my humans and friends and really want a home, and a special family all my own. Will you help me with continued work and patience to work through my few challenges? I am a very good, very sweet boy who just needs patience and consistency...and a furever home!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nView full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.\n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.\n\n",

            "description": "Maybe it's a good thing that 8 1/2-year-old Tracy is almost blind. We wouldn't want her to see how quickly other dogs are being adopted from New Rattitude, while she has waited month after month without a single application. Honestly, we don't get it! This sweet 26-lb. Rattie mix has no other physical problems or any behavioral issues, and caring for her diminishing eyesight requires no medication. All she needs is someone who can work with her limited vision by keeping her environment physically consistent and predictable. She will surprise you with her ability to move about with ease both indoors and out. Needless to say, her adopting family should not have young children, who are rarely consistent or predictable, but she would make a great companion to an older adult who is home most of the time. In fact, she would very much enjoy sitting beside you on the couch and 'watching' TV. Like most other dogs, Tracy does have personal preferences when it comes to living amicably with other furry friends, but those preferences are not unreasonable. She is not a fan of cats, period. In fact, you would think her vision is 20/20 when she stands at the fence and barks at any cat that walks by! Tracy would also rather not have to put up with those quick-to-correct dogs who might take offense to her accidentally bumping into them. (She means no harm; she just didn't see them!) She gets along with more mellow dogs, however. Tracy is house-trained and walks nicely on a leash, so you'll have a live-in partner to help you meet your daily step goal! Truly her needs are very simple--to love and be loved. Tracy's not asking for pity; she's just asking for a chance. Treat yourself to more photos of Tracy at https://imageevent.com/newrattitude/tracy , and then treat yourself to Miss Tracy.\nOur adoption fee is $175 for adult dogs or $225 for puppies under 6 months old.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog,\nPLEASE READ THE DETAILED ADOPTION PROCESS information on our website\nat www.\nNewRattitude.org/adopt/\n\nFrom there, you can access our adoption application or contact our Adoption Team for more info.",

He is unfortunately coming back to Buster due to unforeseeable issues. He likes a good walk but doesn't need constant exercise. He isn't a fan of small animals or other dogs, so he would need to be an only pet. However, he is more than enough dog to keep a family happy. If you have the space in your life and are looking for an awesome pup, consider giving Tyson a chance. *update* Tyson is in a foster home and his foster mom says he is just the biggest people pleaser. All he wants to do is be next to his people all day. He is happy with two walks a day, after breakfast and dinner. He is just waiitng for his perfect furever family to find him",

He joined BAARK\u2019s Rescue & Adoption Program last year, another senior black dog dumped at Chicago Animal Control by an owner who no longer wanted him. So sad that Magic has been with us for so long\u2026another big black dog!\n\nMagic is a very handsome boy,  8-9 years old, about 65 lbs. We are not certain of his breed but he appears to perhaps be a Lab \u2013 Shepherd Mix\u2026with those big pointy ears! He\u2019s friendly but cautious, very well-mannered,  an overall low-maintenance kind of guy.  While Magic can co-exist with other dogs, he definitely prefers calm, senior dogs like himself. Magic is said to have previously lived with cats\u2026.he may be OK with a senior cat who will not startle him with quick movements.   In addition to napping and sleeping, Magic loves long walks and car rides\u2026he walks nicely on a leash but at a quick pace and he\u2019s a GREAT passenger!! Magic would be very stressed by dog parks, doggy day care, or over-active children. \n\nIn spite of his neglectful past, Magic is a well-balanced, personable boy who most definitely deserves a wonderful home of his own. He\u2019s just looking for a quiet peaceful place to spend his twilight years, and have a family of his own to care for him and share his life. An adult home is preferred. No children under the age of 12 years.\n\nLike all of BAARK\u2019s dogs, Magic is fully vetted, neutered, up-to-date on vaccinations, heartworm tested and on year-round heartworm preventative, and microchipped. Magic is in excellent overall health.\n\nIf you are interested in adding Magic to your family, or have any questions about him, please contact BAARKDogRescue@gmail.com or 847-852-0895.\n\n",

But don\u2019t let that scare you, I\u2019m actually a big 120+ lb lover (don\u2019t tell anyone). There is nothing I would like more than to have a family of my own! I\u2019m really smart and know my basic commands and I\u2019m learning to walk on a leash. I have lots of energy and outdoor running games are my favorite, but only outdoors. My foster mom says I have good indoor manners and will stay right by your chair with you...and if you want to pet me the whole time you are sitting there, that\u2019s pyrfect! Don\u2019t get me wrong though, I\u2019m not lazy. I\u2019m always alert. Visitors are fun and I greet them at the door with big tail wags! Food...food - I love my meals! If you can add a little something to my chow I am the happiest. And roast beef treats \u2014 YUM, they\u2019re the best! I don\u2019t have any desire to climb or escape. I\u2019m an adult and I know what\u2019s good for me. I just want you to look into my soulful eyes and hug me and kiss me on the top of my head and love me.

This PB Pyr girl and her pups were surrendered by a farmer who was not pleased that she jumped their little fence and mated with the neighbor's Anatolian Shepherd. Left outside, she was matted, emaciated and had wounds infested with maggots, and even the puppies had maggots attached as well. Didi has been sweet and thankful to be inside and cleaned up, and now she's become a beauty. Now that her pups have been adopted and she's been spayed and back to good health, she's ready for a furever home of her own. After her initial neglect, Didi takes time to warm up to new people, but once she does, she's a sweetie. She is a snuggle-bunny with people, is fine with cats, but can be defensive around other large dogs, so Didi will be placed as an only dog.\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nNGPR dogs are in foster homes throughout the U.S., NOT Beacon, NY.

We know him very well since he has been with us for a couple of years now. \n\nHe walks very well on leash and is not reactive towards other dogs on his walks, but is not dog social so should be the only dog in the home.\n\nMorty is neutered, up to date on shots and microchipped. House trained and crate trained.\n\nIf you are looking for a dog that is more of the hang out type, and you have quiet type house hold; Morty is a great fit.\n\nTo inquire, and/or set up a meeting with Morty, start by filling out application (copy and paste link): https://bluemandog.org/adoption-application/\n\nWe adopt our dogs in the greater LA area and nearby cities. Our adoption procedure and fees are described in our online adoption application.\n\nAdditional contact info: info@bluemandog.org",

            "description": "UPDATE:5/2019 Violet is about 1.5yrs old. Violet recently went on a foster to adopt situation and it did not work out because she was very territorial of the foster mom. Violet did great playing with the kids and the husband but if someone wanted to sit next to foster mom Violet wouold growl.  Violet might be best if she were adopted to a single woman. \n\nUPdate: 9/25/18  Violet is now 9 months old. She is easy going and laid back still but is coming into her guardian instincts and is very loyal to her foster and the property. Violet is still very playful with the other dogs at the rescue and has excellent off leash recall. She is livestock friendly but cat curious. \n\nViolet is potty trained, leash trained, crate trained and still working on her basic obedience and socializing. \n\nWe were told that she was  st bernard mix when we pulled her from the shelter she was in but as she grows we have our doubts and think she may be great dane mix. She stands about an inch shorter than a 5 yr old German Shepherd and is almost as long as he is and she has about 1 yr and 3 months still to grow. She is going to be a huge girl but she is going to be the most loyal, gentle giant companion to whoever is lucky enough to give her a furever home!! \n\n\n4/18Violet is 6months old. She's easy going and laid back but will get in the mix with the other dogs and play! She prefers to be with her humans just leisurely hanging out but she's always up for an adventure!",

She has some difficulties with other pets and will do best as the only dog. She has little patience for most young humans and responds well to consistent guidelines. Princess will not be the right pet for everybody, but for the right person she will give you her love and loyalty forever! NOTE: Princess has developed a condtion called 'dry eye' and it must be treated with prescription eyedrops at least twice daily. She is generally cooperatve with the process, but it is an ongoing expense and is necessary, otherwise her tear ducts don't produce any moisture and her eyes will not last long. We initially tried moisturizing drops and artificial tears but they were ineffective. She uses tacrolimus, which is excellent at helping her generate enough teardrops to keep both eyes functional. 1/31/21 2:27 PM",

This handsome fellow also loves to play and have fun! He enjoys a good game of fetch in the yard as well as relaxing on a lounge chair soaking up the sun. Baxter likes other pups as long as they are friendly and allow him to take the lead. Baxter enjoys lots of cuddle time and adores being petted and loved. He is house trained and knows his basic commands.\n\nUpon first introduction, Baxter may be shy. He needs a moment to learn that you are a friend. He has been patiently waiting for his forever person or family to take him home. He wants what every pup wants: a safe home where he will be loved. This handsome guy loves his people so much that he can be protective of them as well as his home.\n\nHe would do very well in a peaceful, quiet, dog savvy adults only household. He really is a nice little guy who needs a patient and kind family.\n\nBaxter is a 9 1/2 year old German Shepherd mix who is neutered, microchipped, heart worm free and up to date on all vaccines. He is currently at our Freeport location.  \n\nIf you would like to meet Baxter or would be interested in fostering him, please download our adoption application and email it to adopt@bobbicares.org, or call our office at 516-378-4340 and speak to Elyse. It would do Baxter a world of good to be in a home of his own. He once lived in a home and was surrendered by his owner who could no longer care for him. Kindly keep in mind that our adoptions are local only (Long Island, Queens, Brooklyn, Manhattan).",

She had been hit by a car so on top of being emaciated at merely 20 lbs and filled with worms, she also had a badly fractured hip. We had a foster home open up for a young female puppy so when GCAS reached out to us for help, we just so happened to have the perfect foster home for this little girl. Riblett got her freedom ride and we rushed her over to our vet at New Hope Animal Hospital. After Ribletts pelvis healed, she had FHO surgery on her hip to remove the ball of her femur and allow her to heal more quickly and have less pain. She also had a TPLO on her knee.\nABOUT RIBLETT\nRiblett, whom we affectionately call Roo, is a funny girl that likes to play catch me until she sees you have treats, then she comes running and sits at your feet. She loves to run and play, but she is also especially sweet and loving. Riblett needs to be the only pet in the home, but she would make the most adorable and incredible solo companion. She loves her people and has been waiting a long time for a forever family to scoop her up and make her life complete!\nPhoto Album of Riblett: https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1055359244522241.1073742135.162554320469409&type=1&l=acc5ffcf59\nVideo Playlist of Riblett: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYDnJXruR1h1-L2AkKYdIwwCcSW0D-rqS\nOur adoption fee is $300. All dogs are current on vaccinations, spayed or neutered, micro-chipped, on heartworm prevention, and are fed top of the line grain-free food.www.savingpitbulls.org",

            "description": "Friends to the Forlorn\nAdopt-a-BullBreed: Pit Bull Terrier Gender: Male Estimated Date of Birth: August 18, 2015 Size: 65 lbs Location: Dallas, GA\nRESCUING JIGSAW\nJigsaw was seized in a cruelty case in Macon-Bibb County. He weighed 26.8lbs on August 17th, 2017. Our vet said he should weigh a minimum of 45 to 50lbs. His body condition score was a 1 out of 9, one being the worst. He has some badly infected wounds and pressure sores that have ruptured to the bone. His actual hip bones have begun to pop through his skin. On top of being unbelievably thin, Jigsaw has hookworms, coccidia, and he is heartworm positive. He has lived his life on a chain and has developed some behavioral issues. His teeth are worn down to nubs from years of living on a chain and biting at rocks, usually out of frustration.\nABOUT JIGSAW\nAlthough Jigsaw is a game bred pit bull and has lived his life on a chain, Jigsaw is sweet and happy to be around people. In true game dog fashion, he is extremely resilient and despite his condition, he is strong and still wagging his tail for everyone he meets. We were able to get Jigsaw to a healthy weight and has since been fully vetted. Unfortunately, due to his background, Jigsaw has some behavioral nuances that will make him difficult to place. Jigsaw is a silly, unique boy and he loves people, however he will grab hold of any object within reach and will not let go. For this reason, Jigsaw cannot have toys. He will grab a hose, or a broom, or a towel, and getting it back is a struggle. He is currently walked on a chain leash to avoid having to retrieve the leash out of his jaws. For obvious reasons, he is not a fan of other dogs, but he adores people. This boy had a hard start to life and we are giving him the best life we can while he is with us. He currently lives at the Pitbull Palace and it will take a very special family to adopt this boy. If you think you can give Jigsaw the love he so desperately wants and deserves, please contact us!\nOur adoption fee is $300. All dogs are current on vaccinations, spayed or neutered, micro-chipped, on heartworm prevention, and are fed top of the line grain-free food.www.savingpitbulls.org",

She had been at the shelter for 9 months and she was starting to lose weight. Sarah became urgent and needed to get out of there. Sarahs owner went to jail on animal cruelty charges. Her lip is ripped off. Her face and ears are completely scarred. Her front paw is disfigured and she has some serious wounds to her inner leg. She has been bred multiple times and she was heartworm positive. This poor girl has been through it all.\nABOUT SARAH\nEven though Sarah has scars and is missing part of her lip, despite everything she has been through at the hands of humans, she still love everyone she meets. She is resilient and smart and she adores people. She turns into a pile of excited wiggles and happiness when people are around. She loves to run in the yard and will get crazy zoomies. She thinks bones and toys are fun, but she flinches and gets a bit scared if you raise your arm up to throw them for her. She loves food and already knows how to sit and kennel-up, although her missing lip causes her to be a little sloppy when chewing treats. Despite her scars and lack of lip, Sarah is a beautiful dog whose silly personality shines. Sarah would love a family that is kind and enjoys watching her zoom around the yard. She likes to be active, but is also sweet and calm when its time. She would likely do well with older children as she tends to startle at loud noises, like clapping hands. Due to her past, Sarah needs to be the only pet in the home.\nPhoto Album of Sarah: https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1616290405095786.1073742199.162554320469409&type=1&l=8cf7a55f03\nVideo Playlist of Sarah: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYDnJXruR1h2k7-pRYlClnPOyO_w1jXTB\nOur adoption fee is $300.

He appears to already be neutered, but he did not have a microchip and no one came to claim him. Henry County does not adopt out pit bulls, but we had a foster step up to save this giant lug. Rubble was covered in fleas and ticks, has a few teeth that are broken with the roots exposed, and has a little lameness in his back leg. He was also heartworm positive (and has since been treated).\nABOUT RUBBLE\nRubble is getting lots of love in foster care. He is a BIG, handsome boy with tons of love to give. Rubble has been treated for heartworms and is available for adoption. He is a goofy guy with tons of silly personality. Rubble is possessive over dog beds and toys so he does not get these items. He needs a structured adult-only home and his owner needs to be confident and pit bull savvy. Due to his possessive tenancies, we do not recommend Rubble for a home with children.\nPhoto Album of Rubble: https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1475658325825662.1073742185.162554320469409&type=1&l=f16ed53d65\nVideo Playlist of Rubble: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYDnJXruR1h1hzE6dwOICHPayvgNAFZgC\nOur adoption fee is $300. All dogs are current on vaccinations, spayed or neutered, micro-chipped, on heartworm prevention, and are fed top of the line grain-free food.www.savingpitbulls.org",

She was extremely skittish and our friend Shawn & his wife spent an hour trying to get her in the car. Shawn thought she had been shot in the chest due to an infection in her mammary. Our vet determined that she had mastitis. On top of the mastitis, Holly was infested with worms and was heartworm positive. She has recovered from her mastitis and underwent heartworm treatment. Holly is now fully-vetted and ready for a forever home.\nABOUT HOLLY\nHolly is an extremely loving girl. She is very untrusting of strangers. It takes her a while to warm up to new people, but her love is endless once you have earned her trust. She has been great with the other dogs in her foster home. Holly is crate-trained and housebroken. Due to her weariness of strangers, she can be protective of her home and people. It takes a while to build that trust, but once you have it, Holly will show you how incredibly amazing she really is. Holly needs a family who will be patient, allowing her to warm up and then provide endless belly-rubs! Belly-rubs are this girls thing. She will run as fast as she can and jump onto the couch head first, squirming around, rubbing her face into the couch, only to roll over and demand belly rubs.\nPhoto Album of Holly: https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.684183021639867.1073742014.162554320469409&type=1&l=a38a274a07\nVideo Playlist of Holly: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYDnJXruR1h2bLcu8rxX0hFEn5KUZGiHw\nOur adoption fee is $300.

            "description": "Friends to the Forlorn\nAdopt-a-BullBreed: Great Dane/American Bulldog Gender: Male Estimated Date of Birth: April 15, 2012 Size: 85lbs Location: Dallas, GA\nRESCUING STONE\nStone was originally adopted from Douglas County Animal Control when he was a small pup. That family gave him to another family, who then gave him to a third family, and he ended up a Fulton County Animal Control. He was next in line to get put to sleep at the shelter and we were able to pull him on the day he was scheduled to be euthanized.\nABOUT STONE\nStone is a giant. Our best guess is that he's a Great Dane/American Bulldog mix. He is a big, playful goof and he loves toys although he has not quite learned to bring them back to you. Stone does not understand his size or strength. It is very clear that a lack of basic obedience and being dumped several times in his formative years has affected him immensely. Stone is not very trusting of new people. He takes time to warm up and can be rather intimidating due to his size and behavior. He is reactive when in public to people and other dogs. Once he trusts you, you are part of his inner circle and he will show you his true personality. His true personality shines he is fun loving, sweet, and silly. Because his previous owners simply dumped him off onto the next family, he lacked all leadership and guidance in his formative years so he does not know what behavior is acceptable and what is not. Stone does jump up on people and could benefit from some serious obedience training. He is reactive on leash in public and will require a strong owner. Stone also has trust issues and insecurities with strangers due to his previous life experiences. He will require a 6 foot privacy fence and a strong, experienced owner that is willing to take the time to get to know him and work with him on obedience. Due to his size and behavioral concerns, we do not recommend Stone for a home with children.\nPhoto Album of Stone: https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.651126088278894.1073741982.162554320469409&type=1&l=16f60a320e\nMore Video of Stone playing outside: http://youtu.be/SrHvtZB5MWI\nMore Video of Stone: http://youtu.be/tmvpDkCAl3s\nOur adoption fee is $300.

Zeth ended up on the euthanasia list and our good friend at Fulton put out a plea for him. She said Zeth has more personality than any dog she has ever met and she could not let him die in the shelter.\nABOUT ZETH\nThe shelter workers love to sing Zeths praises. Zeth is a complete character. His eyeliner is always on point. His head is way too large for his body. He enjoys stuffed animals and long trips to Petsmart. Zeth has never met a stranger. He is a pretty typical dog, and prefers to select his canine companions himself rather than be told whom he is required to tolerate. Throughout his stay at Fulton County, he made all the girls laugh with his RZF, Resting Zeth Face, and his silly antics. Zeth has a big head and an even bigger personality. The only thing Zeth truly hates is carrots. He does not care for watermelon, but peanut butter is yummy and cheese is his all-time favorite. He is great at taking treats gently.\nZeth is very smart and wants to please his people. He will do anything for food, but is not that into toys. He already knows sit, no, outside, his name, and he is working on his leash manners as he tends to zig-zag a bit and pull at times. Zeth loves car-rides and will politely ride where ever you put him, quietly window watching until he gets sleepy, then he will lay down. He enjoys snuggling with his people and prefers to rest his head on you. If he's not snuggling, he is watching his humans in the house or chewing a bone. He is not much of a barker, but he can be incredibly silly like when he carries his food or water bowl around. Zeth loves affection and adores a good butt-scratch or ear rub. He is not a fan of baths or his crate, but we are working on acclimating him to both. He is house-trained and does not seem to be destructive in any way.\nZeth would prefer to be an only dog, however we think he may be okay with another submissive dog with a proper introduction. What Zeth wants the most is to be with his people. He loves all people of all shapes, sizes, appearances, and ages. Zeth would love an active family that will shower him with the love and affection he deserves.\n*Zeth is in need of a foster home - apply to foster today!*\nPhoto Album of Zeth: https://www.facebook.com/pg/FriendsToTheForlornPitbullRescue/photos/?tab=album&album_id=2447133155344836\nOur adoption fee is $300.

He was brought to us for help as they thought his leg was broken. Stubbs was not one of our dogs, but we helped the Good Samaritan out by having our vet examine him. It turns out that Stubbs was born without an elbow. He has a deformed front leg that looks like a chicken wing and is not usable. His new 4-legged brother was not fond of him and we took him in as a Forlorn dog.\nABOUT STUBBS\nStubbs is a special boy. His deformed front leg does not slow him down - he can still climb stairs and zoom around the yard. He may suffer some arthritis in his other shoulder later in life due to having to keep his weight on that one leg. Our vet determined that there was no reason to remove his leg since it doesn't bother him. Stubbs is a goofy boy. Stubbs can be untrusting of new men, but he loves human affection and he has done well with all the dogs that he has met at the Pit Bull Palace.\nPhoto Album of Stubbs: https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.568770296514474.1073741890.162554320469409&type=1&l=4c670051a0\nVideo Playlist of Stubbs: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYDnJXruR1h1f9l91WXN-18UdaKDl3XkN\nOur adoption fee is $300.

He was packed with intestinal parasites and coccidia, but he has made a full recovery and only his scars remain.\nABOUT FABIO\nFabio is a black pit bull with many, many scars. Jason lovingly named him Fabio because although most would look at him and be frightened (or maybe even not notice him at all), Fabio is a handsome boy to us. Fabio is a small guy, weighing in at about 40 lbs. One would think he would love the comfort of an Air Conditioned home after living outside for so long, but this couch potato of a guy really enjoys sunning on the porch or in the yard. (Seriously, the sun is his favorite!) He is a laid-back, chill guy that will get excited zoomies at feeding time, but afterwards he will curl up on his bed to lounge or nap. He is also good in the tub for bath time and will occasionally chew on a Nylabone to keep him self occupied. He has not been destructive in his foster home. Fabio has a hole in his palate that we tried to have surgically repaired to no avail. Because of this, he eats soft food. Although hard food may irritate the soft tissue of his palate, Fabio is perfectly content eating soft food, he has never been bothered by this odd, genetic malformity, and we don't expect it to cause him any issue in the future.\nWhen he first came to us, Fabio was a little disconnected with people, but he has since fallen head over heels for any kind of human affection. If you spend any time with him, it is instantly obvious that his affection for people is astronomical. He has high desire to please and, in true pittie fashion, he is very emotionally connected now. He loves having visitors and gets excited to meet new people. Although Fabio has exponential love for all people, he needs to be the only pet in the home. He is happiest when snuggled up with you (he's a VERY good snuggler) and he can be a little eager about bed-time. In the late evening, he will tell you it's bed time. He is not a big barker so the only time you'll typically hear him make noise is during feeding time or when he's telling you it's bed time. Due to his unfortunate start in life, being in public and seeing other dogs can stress him out so he would love a family that likes to spend time with him at home. Fabio is ready to crawl into your lap, give you cute little kisses, and steal your heart!\nPhoto Album of Fabio: https://www.facebook.com/pg/FriendsToTheForlornPitbullRescue/photos/?tab=album&album_id=2499019810156170\nOur adoption fee is $300.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Personality:\nWe have sweet Mitchell listed as special needs only because he needs socialization. He's an awesome dog but he's skittish and hesitant with people. He needs a home that can and will socialize him and get him out and about to experience life. Mitchell will prefer a quieter home possibly by himself or with another canine friend to play with. He does great with other dogs but doesn't seem to understand or know how to play with others...human and canine alike. He will need time to open up and trust because it doesn't appear that he's had that prior to SSR. He's a very sweet boy that lurks in the background in his foster home but you can see that he wants to be part of the pack. Are you active in hiking, walks and exploring new territory, running a few miles a day? Why not consider Mitchell as a partner for all the above. I'm sure he wants to do it, he just needs a friend to do it with.\n\nNone of our foster dogs are tested with cats because we have no way of testing them with cats. Siberians are notorious for their high prey drive and typically kill cats, rabbits, chickens, birds, squirrels, opossums, etc., so we we don't have much success adopting them out to homes with cats. Most of our foster dogs are with us for killing cats, chickens and goats to begin with so our assumption is they are not good with cats and other small things that move.\n\nSiberians are typically good with children of all ages and the only reason we would not list them as not good with kids is because they may be too energetic and bouncy and knock over a toddler.\n\nSouthern Siberian Rescue is a volunteer based 501(c)3 organization based out of Raleigh, NC, so we do not have a physical facility with operating hours that you can visit to meet our dogs. All of our foster dogs are in our personal homes. You need to fill out our adoption application (http://www.southernsiberian.com/info/adoption) and get approved to adopt and then we will set a time for you to meet our foster dogs. As a volunteer based group, we all have jobs, family, personal dogs and other commitments but we try to acknowledge and process applications as quickly as we can. That being said, we try to keep our available foster dogs as current as we can also but it is time consuming to get pics and information on new dogs so not all of our dogs are listed at all times. Please fill out our application and then we can discuss dogs that will work for you and your situation. We average 40-45 Siberians in our program so we are certain we have one that will work for you. Please know that we are not obligated to answer inquiries on dogs as we will focus on approved applicants. Again, there is ample time to discuss all of our foster dogs AFTER we have an approved application on file. We do adopt out of state as long as we can get a home check done. We ask that you, your family and existing pets make the trip to NC to meet and adopt our foster dogs.\n\nSSR can not and will not hold dogs for anyone. If we do, that means another Siberian will die in a shelter because a shelter dogs time is very limited, as is our foster space. We do our best to process applications in the order received and first application gets first interest in our foster dog(s). We understand that there will be scheduling conflicts with home checks and meet and greets but we will try to accommodate for that if a potential adopter has interest in a particular foster dog in our program.\n\nAll Southern Siberian Rescue foster dogs are microchipped, up to date on shots, spay/neutered, on monthly heartworm preventative and flea and tick preventative.

Our TLC club members receive special follow-up help when adopted into their new home including visits with a professional behaviorist. Speak to our volunteers about more information regarding our TLC members.****5 yr old, male, pit bull terrier, no cats, no dogs, kids over 12, barks at noises, no apartmentsHi, My name is Todd and I'm looking for a new best friend!What are my likes? Playing, running, chasing, being with my humans, playing, wagging my tail, playing, and going on lots of walks.Dislikes?Kitties (why do people have those fluffy things), sitting still, not playing, and not laying on top of my hooman!What's my perfect date?Anything fun that I get to do with my HOOMAN! Are you Todd's new best friend? Todd would really like a new home that is PIT BULL SAVVY and will give him the attention and exercise he craves. This big meatball needs a Hooman who will continue to work on his leash training and provide him with a job that will occupy his time... even if its just learning obedience commands. He wants someone consistent who will give him the exercise he needs. If you are Todd's perfect human fill out an application today.Please note we do not have a central kennel facility, all of our pets are located in foster homes. The first step in meeting one of our furry friends is to fill out an application on our website at <a href=''www.rainbowrescues.org''>www.rainbowrescues.org</a>. A volunteer will be in contact with you in 1-2 business days to review your application and speak with you about the adoption process. Our adoption fees at this time are $250 for Adult dogs, $300 for puppies (6 months and under), $100 for senior dogs, $100 for cats, and a $50 fee for small animals. **Please be aware that we are not responsible for inaccurate information on some cross-posted sites such as inaccurate adoption fees and inaccurate pet info.**",

He does great with all the dogs at our kennel house except two.  One is a very large shepherd and the other is a unneutered male dog with medical issues that don't allow us to neuter him.  He is great with all the other dogs and seems a little afraid of the vicious herd of chihuahua's we have that like to chase him. lol\n\nHe has a sister named Hailey but we know it isn't possible to get two pits adopted together so after a year we need to search for them separate homes. They are both super depressed and unhappy.  If you want to see Hailey, she is also listed.\n\nMac loves to sleep on the bed and cuddle.  He misses that in his past home.  He was spoiled rotten until his mother passed away and since then his life has been chaos, being passed around from friend to friend, then living in a van to coming to us.  He just wants to be loved again.  FOSTER OR ADOPT THIS BOY!\n\nAll dogs are neutered/spayed, microchipped, fully vaccinated, dewormed and heartworm negative. Adoption fee is $200.  All approved applicants get a two week trial. \nAPPLY AT FORGOTTENPAWS.COM\n",

            "description": "Thank you for your inquiry. Tom has been adopted but we have to wait for them to go pick him up after the stay at home is lifted.  Once he is picked up we will remove his profile. Please do not write to us for an application. Sorry for any inconvenience. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom is such a handsome fellow, pictures don't do him justice,  and super nice too.  This guy is about 4 years old and could stand to lose a few pounds. It\u2019s so cute to see him running around with the other dogs in his foster home. He is learning that attention is a very good thing. With kindness and love, he is coming out of his shell at his foster home.\n\nTom is a sweet and good-hearted guy but he is very shy when you meet him and takes time to warm up. He prefers to sit and hang out rather than crawl onto your lap.  The poor little guy has some trust issues but we are confident that with human kindness he will continue to blossom. Tom gets along great with his foster family's dogs. He will get along fine with cats.\n\nHe does need some help with basic commands and going on a diet, but he is a smart little guy and could pick up the basics more if someone will work with him. This doll would be a great addition to a family or individual looking for a wallflower to join their family. He would do ok with no other dog in the house as long as someone was around during the day but finds more courage with another dog around and would prefer a canine companion. Tom would not be happy being alone all day if his people worked a full workday.\n\nTom\u2019s adoption fee is $275.00 and he is being fostered in San Jose, CA\n\nAll our dogs are in private foster homes and arrangements to meet our dogs occur after an application has been received.\n\nIf you would like to know more about this sweet boy or receive an application to adopt, please contact us at Dogzonerescue@yahoo.com.",

I\u2019m a little guy with no tail and I like to remind the other dogs here in my foster home that they have one. So I\u2019m always biting their tails and trying to get them to chase me. I like to play fetch too if someone will play with me. And I love toys. I always have one with me. It takes me some time to warm up to new people and other animals. But once I do I won\u2019t leave your side. I sleep with my foster mom in bed at night. And I\u2019m house broke and crate trained. Car rides are very stressful for me and I bark and bark until I\u2019m hoarse. Did I mention I\u2019m deaf? I can\u2019t hear anything. And because of that I need a securely fenced yard. I have a lot of prey drive so invisible fencing won\u2019t work for me.  Rabbits, stray cats, squirrels and even birds don\u2019t dare invade my yard. I don\u2019t attend events because the commotion and all of the people stress me out. So if you\u2019d like to meet me fill out the application and my foster mom will get a hold of you for a private meeting. My adoption fee is sponsored by an anonymous donor in honor of their beloved dog, Buzzy.\n\nPlease understand the statements about this animal are based upon the foster home's evaluation of the animal.

            "description": "Adoption fee on this dog is $300.\n\nSuarez is a handsome 3 to 5 year old sable male. He came to us through a local shelter so little is known of his background. He originally tested as heart-worm positive but has successfully completed his treatment.\n\nWhile Suarez can be nervous in new environments and with new people, once he gets comfortable, this young boy is very affectionate and just wants to be with his humans. He loves car rides.\n\nSuarez is always excited to go out for walks and walks well on a leash. He knows some basic commands such as sit and has learned to sit and wait for his food or to come in from outside. He is housebroken and crate trained. He has a dog door to go outside and has access to inside and outside all the time.\n\nSuarez is an active boy with a lot of energy. He loves to run around and wrestle with the female Shepherd in his foster home. When excited, Suarez can be a little mouthy and doesn't quite understand that playing with humans is different than playing with other dogs. We recommend no children under the age of 12 for this boy. Suarez was very neck and collar sensitive when we got him and he would attempt to correct his human and do his best to get his way. This has gone away with a lot of training but he can still become defensive if he feels threatened. He will need to be muzzled and possibly sedated for nail trimming and vet visits.\n\nThis boy will do best with a strong handler who understands the need for constant, consistent leadership and who will continue his training, exercise and socialization. He would also love another active large dog to play with.\n\nThis dog is a Level 3. Please be sure you understand what a dog of this Level requires. Go to our home page for an explanation of the Dog Rating Levels.\n\nFor more information and to see when this dog will be attending an Adoption Day, please see our Dogs page on our main website at www.gcgsr.org. \n\nWe operate within a reasonable driving distance from the Greater Sacramento area, the \tCentral Valley down to Merced, and Lake Tahoe. A reasonable driving distance is determined by where one of our volunteers is willing to drive within our areas of service. That means we don't adopt out of our area, to Southern California, or Out of State. \n\n\nThank you for visiting!",

Impaired vision.  Needs an adult only home, calm environment\n\nAdditional info:  \n\nThis is a very heartbreaking story, so get your tissues ready. Aston was surrendered to the shelter extremely scared and matted, especially around his face.  When the shelter tried to cut away his hair he put up resistance.  They eventually had to sedate him and what they found under all that hair was, bulging, blood shot eyes. He had taken a pretty severe blow to the head which had affected his eyes and he has been on eye drops ever since.  \n\nAston has come such a long way and after a two and a half with us he is SO ready for his forever home! As much as we all love Aston, it's time for him to leave us. Aston still has some issues with trusting new people and it may take him a few weeks until he becomes comfortable enough with someone. We are sure these issues are a combination of the trauma that he experienced in his past and the fact that he's blind. The key to Aston's trust is to allow him some time to get to know your voice and smell, he must always know when you are going to touch him and this can easily be done by using your voice in a soft matter and allowing him to smell you first. Once he trusts you he has no issues with getting love and giving love, he will follow his person around like a little shadow but at the same time can be independent and is content just knowing you are in the room. He does not let his vision slow him down on walks and moves confidently with no issues when on leash. Because of Aston bite history and he can be overwhelmed in busy situations, so he cannot be around children and needs a calm environment in an adult only home, he prefers to have someone around often. A yard for Aston would be amazing as he loves to trot around and sunbathe.\n\nIf you are not ready to adopt just yet and would like to help in other ways, please consider clicking on the green \u201cSponsor Me\u201d button above to help this dog receive the best care we can give.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Personality:\nKyle is new to our program but so far we know he is a bit anxious and will do best in a quieter home without a lot of distraction. Young children may be too much for him and he may appreciate a home as an only dog only so he can relax and enjoy all the attention. He's in a foster home with other dogs and does fine with them but again, seems anxious with all the hustle and bustle. Please check back for updates on Kyle as we learn more about him\n\nNone of our foster dogs are tested with cats because we have no way of testing them with cats. Siberians are notorious for their high prey drive and typically kill cats, rabbits, chickens, birds, squirrels, opossums, etc., so we we don't have much success adopting them out to homes with cats. Most of our foster dogs are with us for killing cats, chickens and goats to begin with so our assumption is they are not good with cats and other small things that move.\n\nSiberians are typically good with children of all ages and the only reason we would not list them as not good with kids is because they may be too energetic and bouncy and knock over a toddler.\n\nSouthern Siberian Rescue is a volunteer based 501(c)3 organization based out of Raleigh, NC, so we do not have a physical facility with operating hours that you can visit to meet our dogs. All of our foster dogs are in our personal homes. You need to fill out our adoption application (http://www.southernsiberian.com/info/adoption) and get approved to adopt and then we will set a time for you to meet our foster dogs. As a volunteer based group, we all have jobs, family, personal dogs and other commitments but we try to acknowledge and process applications as quickly as we can. That being said, we try to keep our available foster dogs as current as we can also but it is time consuming to get pics and information on new dogs so not all of our dogs are listed at all times. Please fill out our application and then we can discuss dogs that will work for you and your situation. We average 40-45 Siberians in our program so we are certain we have one that will work for you. Please know that we are not obligated to answer inquiries on dogs as we will focus on approved applicants. Again, there is ample time to discuss all of our foster dogs AFTER we have an approved application on file. We do adopt out of state as long as we can get a home check done. We ask that you, your family and existing pets make the trip to NC to meet and adopt our foster dogs.\n\nSSR can not and will not hold dogs for anyone. If we do, that means another Siberian will die in a shelter because a shelter dogs time is very limited, as is our foster space. We do our best to process applications in the order received and first application gets first interest in our foster dog(s). We understand that there will be scheduling conflicts with home checks and meet and greets but we will try to accommodate for that if a potential adopter has interest in a particular foster dog in our program.\n\nAll Southern Siberian Rescue foster dogs are microchipped, up to date on shots, spay/neutered, on monthly heartworm preventative and flea and tick preventative. For additional information on Southern Siberian Rescue and Siberian Huskies, please visit www.SouthernSiberian.com. To fill out an application, please visit\n\nhttp://www.southernsiberian.com/info/adoption\n.",

            "description": "Sophie is a 6 yr old spayed female who's owner unfortunately passed away. With no family available to take her in she now finds herself amongst strangers. It's obvious that she misses her papa but with her very sweet and loving nature she has already made friends.\nShe was use to having her human at home with her so she'd made a wonderful company for a retired person/couple. Her papa spoiled her with sweats so she could stand to loose a good 10 - 15 lbs putting her at a healthier weight of about 40lbs but we don't talk about it around Sophie .\nShe has been spayed, current on all vaccines including rabies and bordetella, heartworm and fecal negative and microchipped. She has been started on a monthly heartworm and flea preventative flea preventative .\nIf you've been searching for that perfect cuddle bug then please consider meeting Sophie. Online applications are now being accepted at www.lostangelsanimalrescue.org. For more information please email lostangelsanimalrescue04@yahoo.com.\nAdoption donation: $150.00",

            "description": "My name is LOLA, aka LalalalaLola, Lolita Mamacita, Lowes, Lolo. (My humans love nicknames.) I answer to all of them, especially if there's food or a rubdown involved. My humans called me Lola because I am low to the ground. I think I'm just aerodynamic.\n\nI came to my humans with four itty bitty puppies, which I cared for and played with, until they got their new homes. I am proud to say I raised beautiful, if rambunctious, pups!\n\nMy perfect day is: get up; stretch in my crate; eat breakfast; go outside and potty; sunbathe in the backyard (I know all the best places to go as the sun moves); hangout and watch TV with my humans for awhile (especially Animal Planet, I sleep if the news is on); hang out in my crate until the big guy gets home; go for a walk; eat dinner; go potty and watch some TV before bed.\n\nI am learning good manners. I know sit, down, leave it and off. I obey about 80% of the time. I also know to wait for my food and to wait to be invited in the house or out the gate. I am a work in progress. With consistency I'm a fast learner and love to make my humans happy.\n\nI love to fetch exactly 2.5 times, with great enthusiasm. My favorite toy is...I'm not sure. I eat them before I grow to like them. But a frozen cow bone section keeps me happy for months.\n\nI love humans of all shapes and sizes. Cuddling is my favorite game. My humans say I can't hold my licker, but I think they secretly love it. It's really hard to keep all my love inside. I gotta let it fly!\n\nI prefer to be the only dog in the house. I really like watching them on TV, but don't see the need to share my home with them. With all this love, why would you want more than me?\n\nI have a very waggy tail, a happy-go-lucky disposition, and am about 6 years old. Give me a home and I'll give you all my love and my very best efforts to melt your heart!\n\nLola should be the only pet in the house. She prefers to be able to only have to share her love with her humans.\n\nThe adoption donation for Lola is $200\n\nInterested in meeting this dog or another one of our available dogs? Simply complete and submit our adoption application on our website www.norcalbullybreedrescue.org (FROM YOUR HOME COMPUTER, not cell phones, yet! We\u2019re working on that!!) and we will respond to you within 3-5 days. Once a yard check is completed and you\u2019ve passed the adoption process, you\u2019re welcome to meet any of our dogs!!!\n\n\nNorCal Bully Breed Rescue (NBBR) is a foster based rescue with foster homes spread throughout the Sacramento area.\nWe require our adopters to be within a 50 mile radius of us.\nThis is because we need to do a physical yard check to guarantee that the potential adopter's yard is secure, and also have them be close enough should any behavioral issues arise, and the assistance of our trainer is needed.\n(*FaceTime or Skype are NOT acceptable methods of communication regarding yard checks.)\n\nWe HAVE made exceptions for dogs that have been with us long term, and for senior dogs. We would still need to perform a yard check, and would be happy to do so for a dog that has been passed over repeatedly, but not for dogs that are in high demand.\nIt would need to be to a neighboring state to California. NOT across the country. That would be too much.\n(*We will NOT be making this exception for puppies or designer breed dogs, so please don\u2019t ask. It\u2019s way too much for us to have to request time off of work and lose pay to drive a dog out of area when we have plenty of great homes in our area wanting to adopt these dogs.)\n\nWe try our best to match our dogs to the perfect homes, and match them based on their personalities, not their looks.\n\nAdoptions are not done on a first come, first serve basis, rather in the order of what homes are the right match for that particular dog.\n\nOur adoption fees are based on the dog and typically range from $200-$500. In the case of senior dogs (6+ years), fees will be waived to the right home. This includes spay/neuter, vaccines, microchip, and deworming (if necessary). In the case of designer breed dogs, like French Bulldogs and English Bulldogs, the adoption fee will be significantly higher in order to offset the costs associated with their surgeries, or associated with their demand.\n\nThanks so much for your interest, and we hope we are able to match you up with your next family member!!! Looking forward to your application!!!\n\n",

(Seriously, this girl loves balls!)\n\nPiper came to Friends For Life after a high-rise apartment just wasn\u2019t a good match for her lifestyle. She is dying for a home with a yard that she can fetch every day in!\n\nJob please! Piper absolutely adores feeding her brain and she has mastered commands \u201csit\u201d, \u201ckennel\u201d, \u201cdown\u201d, \u201cbring\u201d, \u201cdrop\u201d, and \u201cgive\u201d to name a few. She is also trained to stay still for veterinary procedures, like blood draws and vaccinations.\n\nExcellent house manners! Piper is very well-behaved indoors. Although she is crate-trained, she doesn\u2019t need to stay in a crate when left alone because she is 100% housetrained and not destructive at all, though she does love chewing her toys.\n\nA life in the burbs. Piper would prefer to live a predictable life in a quiet neighborhood. She likes her quiet, so is best as a companion for adults or kids 10 and up. She also really enjoys car trips to green spaces for walks in nature. This girl is no city mouse!\n\nProper intros, Please! Piper came to us extremely fearful of strangers. We\u2019ve trained her to the point where she can reliably meet and trust new people in just one short meeting, but she does need to be formally introduced to feel comfortable with visitors.\n\nMust play fetch! People who don\u2019t like to throw balls need not apply for Piper! She is a working dog and her job of choice is to chase and locate balls and bring them back to you. She\u2019ll climb obstacles and tread through water to get them and is a marvel to watch. At the same time, when the game is all done, she will dutifully head inside with you.\n\nDo you have a quiet house, lots of toys, and an arm to throw them with? That\u2019s all it takes to make Piper the happiest dog, ever! Come meet her today and see how happy she can make you with her adorable antics!\n",

I love people and other dogs but would do best in a home without.  I am housebroken and crate trained and an all around great dog.  I have been having some issues with resource guarding with my food but my foster and I are working on it!  Check our Saturday adoptable list to see if I will be at this week\u2019s event or call or email with questions!\n XOXOXO-Noble\n\n\n**The ADOPTION FEE for this pet is $300 which includes getting the puppy/dog up to date on rabies, distemper and bordetella vaccines, fecal test and deworming if necessary, heartworm test, spay or neuter (not including pre-surgical bloodwork) and a microchip. Free access to our weekly training classes is also included for the life of the dog, something no other rescue in the area offers.***",

She was adopted as a young pup and returned to our rescue at about 2 yrs old because of changes in the home that sparked fighting between her and one of the other dogs.  She lived with children.  House broken but not a fan of being crated.   She is currently in boarding and desperately misses having a home and family. \nPenny has been in boarding for 3 years)o: Since she has been boarding for so long and is likely stressed she will need a foster/adopter willing and able to keep her separate and do slow intros\u00a0with other dogs (if there are any) until she gets used to her new home, family and settles in. We desperately need to find her a family.  Until then FBRR is asking for your help!  We need a sponor or sponsors for her boarding and care.  If you would like to donate you can go to Www.paypal.com send to Luvabull@optonline.net (earmark for penny)\n\nFor more info and an application please contact kris at kobemnstr@hotmail.com",

Other than meeting our babies at events, we do require that you have an approved adoption application to schedule a meet and greet.

She loves people and children but she can be selective with men. Her favorite thing is to lie and cuddle. Yari is also dog selective, she would be better as the only dog in the home. She is a pitbull/plotthound mix, and she is 6 years old. Yari is spayed/microchipped, fully vetted, on flea/tick and heartworm prevention.

Abandoned at a local high-volume shelter, this sweet five year old Staffie mix was on the list to be euthanized. Mighty Mutts got there in the nick of time and eventually found him a forever home. However, his mom is no longer able to take care of him. Mighty Mutts stepped right in again, and now Moe is enjoying his foster home along with his foster dad and his dad\u2019s dog Bugsy, a Mighty Mutts alumni (see pictures of the two of them snuggling above).\n\nAfter spending some time with him, we discovered Moe is completely deaf. Despite his disability and the trauma of moving from the home he knew to his foster home, Moe is a sweet mush who likes nothing more then either playing with his foster brother or snuggling next to his foster dad. What would make him even happier is a forever home of his own! \n\nMoe is about 60 pounds. He gets along great with people and dogs that he knows. Moe does not get along with cats. He can have some anxiety on leash (most likely due to his deafness) and a bit of separation anxiety as well. All he needs is a loving home and someone to help his confidence and show him how to be the best he can be!\n\nMoe is currently in a foster home in Brooklyn.",

            "description": "My name is Sammy (aka, \u201cScampers\u201d) and I am a delightful and adorable little guy!\n\nQuick Facts:\no\tBreed: Spaniel/Terrier mix (??)\no\tGender: Male\no\tAge: 3 years old\no\tSize: 30 pounds\no\tGood with\u2026\no\tDogs? Yes!\no\tCats? Sorry, no!\no\tKids?  6+\n\nHistory\nI am the most delightful, adorable, sweet, funny, silly, loving, affectionate, and friendly little guy! I used to live in Katmandu, Nepal, on the streets (like a ton of dogs there), and life was awfully hard.\n\nI had no idea how much harder it could get, but then I was struck by a motorbike or motorcar and became paralyzed from the waist down.  Oh boy, that was really rough.   But when faced with challenges, you just kind of figure it out, so I learned to drag myself around pretty well using my front arms! Thankfully, a wonderful Nepal rescue group found me dragging myself around like this, scooped me up, and took me to a local shelter. From there, a fabulous volunteer contacted Cayuga Dog Rescue, and they said that if she could get me to them, they would be delighted to take me into their foster program, since they have the best vets in the world right here at Cornell and a wonderful dog-loving community.\n\nThat lovely woman raised money for my very long international flight and off I went to New York City on April 2nd! Wow, what an adventure\u2026scary and loud and dark and upsetting, but soooo worth it because when I landed, I was greeted by the nicest CDR volunteers and from that moment on, life has been unbelievably wonderful!\n\nPersonality\nI am such a little lovey-dovey guy!  I LOVE affection and attention!  I make adorable and very passionate squeaking sounds of delight when my foster parents come home from work, scamper (fast!) right over to them as they walk in the door, and nuzzle into their legs like crazy.  When they rub my face and neck (my favorites!), I close my eyes and lean my face into their hands more and more, it feels SO good. I cannot even believe how good it feels to have my face and neck rubbed, I could have that 24/7 and never tire of it.\n\nI have a nickname\u2026it\u2019s \u201cScampers!\u201d    This is because I scamper about the house in the most adorable fashion.  I scamper over to the door to greet them when they come home, scamper along behind them as they move from room to room, and scamper along with the other dogs in the house (really fast) when they get excited about something going on outside!  My foster parents say my scampering is hilarious,  me zipping about the house on my butt or with my back legs folded under me, sailing by as if I\u2019m motorized!  They say if they put a little white sheet on top of me, and cut some eyeholes in it, when i sailed around I would totally look like one of those cartoon ghosts!\n\nI have a lot of new, cool gear (thanks to the wonderful donors who sent in money for my care \u2026thank you, thank you thank you!) that helps me have a pretty regular doggy life despite my disability.  I have two favorites:  1) the hind-end harness which allows you to hold up my butt/hind end when I walk or run so my back legs don\u2019t drag.  You would be amazed at how fast I can run when my foster mom is holding my hind end in the harness\u2026she has to break into an actual run alongside me to keep up even though I have little legs and she has big ones!  ?  And 2) the pet stroller that I get to sit in so we can go for longer \u201cwalks\u201d so I can get to know my new neighborhood and new country!   Going out in the stroller is amazingly fun\u2026we go to the park once a day, and I sit up in the stroller the whole time, super observant and super interested, watching and listening to everything!  An added bonus is that the people we stroll by all \u201cooooh\u201d and \u201caaaah\u201d about how cute I am sitting there in my stroller, and they want to hear my story and meet me!  \n\nI\u2019m very easygoing, extremely adaptable, and a generally chill guy.   I do my scampering around in the house and yard a bit, and sure love going out in the pet stroller for my daily \u201cwalk\u201d in the local park, but otherwise, I am super content to lay around in one of the very comfy dog beds and just relax and nap.  If something interesting happens and the other dogs get to barking, I\u2019ll check it out for sure, but then am happy to scamper back to a dog bed and get back to my relaxing.   Since I love people so much, love meeting new people, and am so chill and adaptable, the rescue folks think I would make an amazing therapy dog. I would love to earn my CGC and be a visiting dog to children, the elderly, or folks in hospitals!\n\nI like dog toys like stuffed animals and bones and chew sticks, but the other dogs in my foster home get jealous over toys, so my foster parents explained that unfortunately they can\u2019t give me toys to play with, but that maybe in my forever home I will be able to have toys again.  That\u2019s ok, I understand!\n\nCohabitation\nI love people!  So very, very much!  So far I like women and men equally (though I do give slight preference to anyone who rubs my face and neck, haha)!\n\nI have been around some little kids and was just fine with them, and would be happy to live in a home with kids over 6.  Since my daily care (see medical section below) takes some time, the rescue folks think it makes most sense for me not to live in a home with toddlers, who require a lot of daily care themselves!\n\nI am really good with other dogs!  When I meet new dogs, I will often growl when they get near to me, which the rescue folks say is very understandable given how vulnerable I am due to my paralysis.  When the other dogs are respectful of my nervousness and give me some space, I go on and make friends with them pretty quickly.  I just need to make sure that they are nice dogs before I let my guard down!   \n\nI think cats are the same as chipmunks and squirrels\u2014critters to be chased and barked at, so I need a cat-free home please.\n\nMedical\nGiven my past, I am in pretty spectacular health!  I\u2019ve had full blood work and chemistry panels which look \u201cfabulous!\u201d according to the vet!  I\u2019ve had a few urinary tract infections since arriving, which is pretty common for paralyzed dogs and get treated with a course of antibiotics.  The vets are working on figuring out a plan for me that hopefully will help me stop getting these so regularly. \n\nHere\u2019s the deal with my paralysis\u2014I spent a bunch of time being looked at by the wonderful doctors up at Cornell Sports Medicine Clinic, and they say that I have an injury to my spine (most likely due to being hit by a car or motorcycle) that cannot be surgically fixed.  The injury makes it impossible for my brain to send messages to my legs and vice versa, so I can\u2019t regain normal walking ability.  \nBUT, the good news is that I have lots of reflexes functioning very well in my legs and feet, so if I do daily exercises that strengthen my leg and hip muscles and reprogram healthy leg movement patterns, I could very possibly become what they call a \u201cspinal walker\u201d which means I could end up being able to walk to some degree (if a bit awkwardly), based totally on muscle reflexes!  My foster parents think it extremely likely that this will happen, since they are seeing improvement in my ability to bear weight on my back legs (once they get me into a standing position) already.  \n\nI get 15 minutes or so of at-home PT every day, which I will need to continue probably forever.  It\u2019s really easy, and has three parts:  1) they move my leg and feet joints around for a few minutes, a few times each day, 2) they stand me up (on carpeting or grass, not on slick floors), and let me practice putting weight on my legs and feet for a minute at a time, a few times a day, and 3) they take me out in my hind-end harness to walk and run around the yard a few times a day.  That\u2019s it!  \n\nThe only other care I need relates to going to the bathroom.  For peeing, my foster parents express (aka squoosh!) my bladder 3-5 times each day to help me empty my bladder so I don\u2019t dribble urine too much.  I also wear a belly band much of the time in the house to catch any drips that happen.  For pooping, they keep me on a regular meal schedule, so know when I need to poop.  They learned a little trick that gets me to poop on command, so there are rarely any accidents, no muss, no fuss!\n\nFavorite Activities\n\u2022\tGetting affection!  Nuzzling your legs!  Having you rub my face and neck!\n\u2022\tGoing for walks in my hind-end harness!  Going for strolls in my stroller!\n\u2022\tLearning new things!  I\u2019m smart AND I love food!  I know \u201cshake\u201d and am working on \u201cwait!\u201d\n\u2022\tBeing part of a family!  Totally new thing for me, it\u2019s the BEST!\n\u2022\tFOOD!!!!  It was so hard finding food to eat when I was homeless and paralyzed in Katmandu\u2026being given 2 delicious meals every day, plus snacks in between, is heaven!  The vet says I am allowed to gain a few more pounds and I am stoked to hear it!\n\nSummary\nI am a super special dog! I am very affectionate, super friendly, curious, and easygoing!  I make my foster parents laugh constantly with my adorableness and liveliness! I would love to make a glorious life together with you!

            "description": "We want to introduce you to a special adoptable named Seely!  You may remember Seely from 2 years ago when we raised money for an operation on her legs.   For those of you who are new to our shelter, here is her story.  Seely arrived on March 28, 2018 when she was about 4 months old after she was found in a ditch during a rainstorm.  She got her name because her front legs make her walk a bit like a seal due to a birth defect.  But don\u2019t let this fool you!  Her legs certainly do not hold her back and she can run and play with the best of them (just not quite as far and as long).  When Seely was old enough to have her surgery, she had become very fearful of doctors and hospitals.  After much consideration, the decision was made to not pursue the surgery due to the anxiety and stress it would cause her and instead she was fitted for a wheelchair for her front legs.  \nSeely is a special adoptable because she needs a family that will be able to give her time and attention for her expected future medical needs.  Seely would need to be the only animal in the home as she does not like cats and is dog selective.  She plays a little rough with dog friends which sometimes scares the other dog.  She can also be jealous of babies and toddlers in the home, so she would need a home with only older children.  She has thoroughly enjoyed it when the Girl Scouts have come to visit at the shelter!  Seely loves to lay in the sun, have her belly rubbed, go for trips in the car (especially to McDonalds), and go for rides in a wagon.  She is hoping to find her perfect forever home so she can have her special person to love.  The adoption process will be different than our regular procedures, so if you are interested in finding out more about adopting Seely, please call the shelter for more information. \n\nOur adoption fees vary, Shelter Dogs are $150, Prison Dogs are $200, Puppies are $250, and Popular Pure-Breeds are $400. The price includes: a Home Again Microchip, set of shots, de-worming, heartworm testing (if old enough), spay or neuter, and a 1 year rabies shot (if old enough). All dogs adopted must leave with a county license at an additional cost of $17, this fee is cash only. Adoption fees can be done using credit card or cash.  If you are interested in this dog, please call the shelter at 614-879-8368 or fill out an online application at www.hsmcohio.org\n\nHSMC Adoption applications must be done at www.hsmcohio.org Please do NOT click on the \"Adopt Me\" button on this bio. It is only a pet inquiry. If you have additional questions about this dog, please call the shelter at 614-879-8368 or contact us through our website!",

The best way to get him to come out of his shell is to get him to play. He seems to really want to play, he is just very unsure. Because he is so uncomfortable here and very stiff when being handled, I am not comfortable sending him into a home with children. During his cat testing, he was whining and pulling towards the cats but he also moved away on his own. Use caution if going into a home with cats.  It may be best if he goes to a home without another dog. The owner wrote that he does well with small dogs but that he is defensive and fearful with other large dogs. They said that he is very loving and very smart. With a careful introduction and training, he has the potential to do well with cats. He is also doing better at the shelter self-esteem and comfort wise. He seems to be doing really well. He can still be jumpy when he is excited and nervous when first meeting new people, but he is doing relatively well. A child meeting can be conducted for younger children.",

She has a tail that never stops wagging. In fact, she currently has Happy Tail. Her tail is a whip and she can be a bit of a wrecking ball at times. Because of this, she may be too much for some young children. It is up to parents to decide whether their children can handle her energy or not. She is still very much a puppy. She needs training and she needs socialization. She needs work on crate training. She was housed in OBS for awhile and was often found chewing on the bars and whining. She pulls on leash and she jumps up somewhat often. She is your typically puppy with all the puppy behaviors. She would benefit from basic obedience greatly. Her adopters must have time to spend on her in that regard, otherwise, these behaviors won't get better. She is very social and very sweet. She has no issues running up to a complete stranger and getting attention. She is very food motivated. She hasn't shown much interest in toys at the shelter. She seems much more interest in playing with people. She did okay on her cat test. She watched the cats intently then moved away on her own and sought attention from people.",

She is a little nervous at the shelter and isn't quite as rambunctious as her owner said she was in the previous home. Her previous owner said that she loves to play with any and all toys. She shows no such interest at the shelter. At the shelter, she would much rather lay across your lap and get a belly rub. She will play with a toy for barely a moment and then return to her people to get butt scratches and belly rubs. She is a very goofy, loving gal. Her previous owner said that she is alone in the home for long hours during the day without issue. She used to live with cats and children. She did well with both, except she would sometimes attempt to closely investigate the cats. They mostly stayed out of her way. Her previous owners marked that she is nervous of men and loud noises. They also said that she has some guarding habits with food and rawhides. This was reflected at the shelter. She would eat rapidly and not allow the bowl to be taken from her. She would growl over rawhides, but she never went further than a growl. Likewise, she would trade out wonderfully for treats. As far as guarding goes, this is a rather mild case. While older children are preferred, potential adopters with young children can talk to Sarah to get approval for adoption.",

He isn't too interested in toys, but he seems to enjoy chasing after people. He pulls pretty hard on leash and he doesn't appear to know any commands. Despite his age, he is still very active and outgoing. Though he does like to play, he seems to just enjoy being pet and loved on. He is okay with all handling, however, he did not like his ears being touched. This could be due to a possible ear infection (Dr. Fitz will be checking it out today). He has no issues with guarding food items. He used to be around children of all ages and did well with them all. His primary owner was an older woman who was no longer able to care for him. She said that he loves to play with all toys, though he hasn't shown an interest in them at the shelter. He hasn't been around other dogs before. During his cat test, he was very focused on the cats, but he turned away on his own. However, I don't think he could ever catch a cat if he did try to chase them. It is up to adopters if they want to take that chance.",

Does your dog need a companion while you're away? Are you ok with your dog's companion wanting nothing to do with you? Well, read more about Libby - aka your dog's BFF...Libby came to us from Wake County Shelter. She was a stray who was extremely frightened & not exposed to much human contact. We were called to help & since rehab is part of what we do, we answered the call. Libby is BEYOND sweet, but she's also extremely weary of the human world. When she's alone with the other dogs in her foster home, she's a \"normal,\" happy dog - bouncing around the yard, rolling, wrestling & running full blast! However, as soon as Libby reenters the human realm, her anxiety peaks, her tail tucks, & she darts to and from her safe spaces inside the house. Libby cannot be leash walked at all, so she MUST be in a home with a safe, secure, fully fenced yard. Libby will take treats from her foster mom (FM) when in the company of the other pups but is otherwise still very timid when approached. Libby recently started wagging her tail when she sees FM, which is an ENORMOUS step for her - but if FM tries to pet her (even in that tail wagging moment) she freezes or darts away.\nLibby will need an extremely understanding & patient home with another dog or two. While Libby continues to make baby steps, she is still very uncomfortable with human interaction or handling. All improvements, which for her are HUGE, for any other dog, would seem trivial. Libby may or may not progress to what one would expect from a typical family pet. She could adjust in months, years, or not at all. Our goal is to place all our adoptable souls with their 'Pawfect Match' so they can succeed with their Furever Family. Libby is a tough/unique case. Libby requires a stable/permanent situation; an unsuccessful placement & return to the rescue is simply not an option. As much improvement as she's shown with us, she still has tremendous lengths to go. Potential adopters must recognize & fully accept that Libby may or may not overcome whatever circumstances, or lack thereof, prevented her from being completely accepting of humans. Libby may simply remain a companion for other dogs.\nIf you fully understand & can offer all this and more to Libby, submit your application.*\n*Serious inquiries only; circumstance requires lengthy and vigorous application process.",

Kaily loves to watch TV, she will stand in front of it until you turn it on, then she will bark if she wants you to change the channel.\nThis girls is a super great roommate. She knows all of her commands, very smart and just needs someone to love her so she can give that love right back.\nKaily is 4 years old and currently weighs 68 lbs but she could stand to lose a few pounds. I'm sure with regular walks she would probably lose 10 pounds easily. Kaily has a great personalities, she is very quiet, friendly and gets along with all humans and dogs. But it would be best to be your only dog as she does not like to share her humans, she want all of your love to herself. Kaily does not get upset, nor is she destructive. She will sleep in her crate but she is fine just sleeping on her doggy bed, she is not destructive. She will play with toys but she would rather have some ear scratches and love from her human and cuddle besides you. She is not a shadow dog, very independent but she keeps an eye on you to make sure you are still there. Her solemn look turns into a smile while she is following you around and she is just close to you, all she wants s to share her love. Kaily is a great, very calm, well behaved young lady and will make a great family pet.\nKaily is a Labrador Retriever mix with a bronzy brown coat with black going doing the middle. Now that she knows she is safe and not chained up, she is the perfect little lady. She requires very little maintenance and just wants to be loved. She has 1 male playmate that she is fond of but she is in a home with a variety of foster brothers and sisters. She gets along with small and big dogs, her first roommate upon arriving here was a 4 pound Maltese and he made sure she knew who was boss!! Kaily has a mild demeanor; not aggressive in any area and likes to get out for walks but not demanding of them. Nor does her behavior require that she be walked on a daily basis. Kaily's coat looks a lot better now than when she was first rescued. Please consider giving Kaily her chance at a forever home. You would be getting a prized family pet by adopting this girl into your home.\nPLEASE VISIT OUR WEBSITE FOR MORE PICTURES: roxysk9rescue.org\nADOPTION FEE & APPLICATION REQUIRED\nRoxy's K-9 Rescue does not have a shelter, all of our foster dogs are raised in private homes; .

They are two Chihuahua mixes, Molly, about 15 lbs and 10 years old, and Speckles, about 20 lbs and 8 years old.\n \nWe know that bonded pairs are more difficult to adopt out, but this adorable pair were \"CODE RED\" and we certainly did not want to see them lose their lives.  There are so many Chihuahuas and so many seniors looking for homes....we realize finding them an absolutely perfect home for them together, will be a challenge but we are up for it\u2026and they certainly deserve to live their senior years together, with a family who has enough love for both of them!\n \nIn addition to the fact that they are a bit older, each has a mild medical concern, being managed holistically. Molly had been diagnosed with Cushing's Disease which is being well managed by Ophiopogon, a Chinese herb, and we provide Speckles with Hepato, a high quality extract of milk thistle with antioxidants and supportive nutrients. (His liver values showed slight elevation and we wanted to address this.)\n \nBoth Molly and Speckles are doing very well with good nutrition, a couple of supplements, and most important, the love and care of their foster family.\n \nMolly and Speckles are fully vetted, believed to be house-broken, on supplements to manage their respective medical concerns, altered and microchipped for permanent identification.\n\nIf you might be interested in considering Molly and Speckles for your family, please contact BAARKDogRescue@gmail.com or 847-852-0895\n",

They are two Chihuahua mixes, Molly, about 15 lbs and 10 years old, and Speckles, about 20 lbs and 8 years old.\n \nWe know that bonded pairs are more difficult to adopt out, but this adorable pair were \"CODE RED\" and we certainly did not want to see them lose their lives.  There are so many Chihuahuas and so many seniors looking for homes....we realize finding them an absolutely perfect home for them together, will be a challenge but we are up for it\u2026and they certainly deserve to live their senior years together, with a family who has enough love for both of them!\n \nIn addition to the fact that they are a bit older, each has a mild medical concern, being managed holistically. Molly had been diagnosed with Cushing's Disease which is being well managed by Ophiopogon, a Chinese herb, and we provide Speckles with Hepato, a high quality extract of milk thistle with antioxidants and supportive nutrients. (His liver values showed slight elevation and we wanted to address this.)\n \nBoth Molly and Speckles are doing very well with good nutrition, a couple of supplements, and most important, the love and care of their foster family.\n \nMolly and Speckles are fully vetted, believed to be house-broken, on supplements to manage their respective medical concerns, altered and microchipped for permanent identification.\n\nIf you might be interested in considering Molly and Speckles for your family, please contact BAARKDogRescue@gmail.com or 847-852-0895\n",

I have little patience for small dogs and do better with a calm, larger dog. My foster crates me at first when people come to visit because I tend to jump on them. After a few minutes, I'm let out of the crate and I'm fine with the visitors. I'm potty-trained and I go to the door to let you know that I need to go outside, and I'm even crate trained. I love to sleep in my crate and I'll sometimes go in on my own during the day. I love to play catch with kids and hard toys are my favorite. I even know the commands, 'sit, stay, paw and down.'I'm playful and strong and could benefit from a little leash training to learn to control my enthusiasm when on a leash. I've never met a cat so I don't know what my reaction to them would be. A fenced yard would be ideal for my boundless energy. I'm an all-around great family dog for an active, engaged family who wants a young, energetic, happy forever family member and who is past the young puppy training stage. We do recommend older children due to Basil's size, jumping upon to people, and high energy level. If you are interested in meeting/adopting me, please fill out an online dog adoption application for BASIL.",

This little bundle of love was rescued from a kill shelter and has settled in nicely at her foster home where she loves to play in the yard with her foster siblings. She enjoys chewy toys, belly rubs and of course, treats! Peaches is dog and family friendly. \n\nWe are a foster-based rescue and all of our dogs are in loving homes where we can learn each one's unique personality. Knowing this helps us match the dogs up with just the right family. If you would like to meet Peaches, please submit an application today and a volunteer will contact you to talk about this little sweetheart.",

            "description": "Great WATCHDOG.  This 60 pound (approx age 4 years) hound mix called Blue is on top of his game when it comes to demonstrating he's all about keeping watch over his family and their domain.  In times like these he can make sleep a bit easier with his acute hearing and sense of smell inherent in the nose of hound.  Blue's also an athletic sports enthusiast with a love of outdoor life and the promise of adventure it holds.  He's faster than a strong wind when he runs full out like a greyhound at the track.  Do you jog, have a pool or camp/hike near mountain streams?  Have you been thinking you'd feel safer with a companion that can athletically keep up with your pace and a size and overall appearance that would make someone with questionable intentions think twice on a trail or overnight camping?  \n\nSpirit, speed and protection are the descriptive qualities I'd assign to Blue.  Best suited to a stable, energetic lifestyle dynamic - truck or jeep a plus!  Spacious living - no apartments, town homes or close community neighborhoods where houses are tight and streets are constantly busy.  He's more the Little House on the Prairie type hound.\n\nHe's smart.  He can look you right in the eye when you say LOOK and point at your eyes (my favorite).  He works hard for food.  What you'd call a chow-hound as he eats everything. Gets along with other friendly dogs smaller than him.  He enjoys rough manly games like tug and he can get some impressive lift off those four paws - a huge plus for a serious Frisbee tosser.  \n\n Blue needs TRUSTWORTHY stable leadership and structure.  We've built the foundation for him and he's ready for the next rung on the ladder.  Call Aunt Mary 908-362-1333  or e:mail auntmarysdoghouse@yahoo.com if you think Blue could be a potential match to your household dynamic",

Please submit your application to Great Lakes Mastiff Rescue at www.glmr.org because we have Mastiffs available for adoption but are not yet listed. Most Mastiffs are placed from applications submitted and many never appear on this website before they are placed.  Please note, Mastiff puppies are rarely, rarely available in rescue. \n\nI am a purebred English Mastiff that was lucky enough to be taken in by the folks at Great Lakes Mastiff Rescue, Inc.  I need a loving, forever home.  If you can give me that home, please visit www.glmr.org to complete an adoption application and a volunteer will contact you soon. PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING:  GLMR ONLY ADOPTS TO THE GREAT LAKES STATES (MI, OH, IN, IL, WI). PHONE CALLS OR EMAILS WILL NOT BE RETURNED UNLESS YOU HAVE FILLED OUT AN ADOPTION APPLICATION FIRST. A GLMR REPRESENTATIVE WILL CONTACT YOU WITHIN 2 WEEKS AFTER FILLING OUT A FAMILY PROFILE.\n\nIf you are not able to adopt, please consider making a donation to GLMR to help with medical bills for one of these gentle giants. Giant breed dogs also come with giant vet bills. All GLMR dogs are fixed, up to date on shots and healthy when they go to their new homes, but they don't always come to us that way. GLMR does not turn away dogs for health problems! So please help us to help them and make a tax deductible donation to GLMR by clicking the SPONSOR ME button above. Thank you in advance!",

            "description": "BUDDY -  PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU APPLY TO ADOPT!!  This little terrier was just a puppy and living under a car in a warehouse district, slowly starving to death.  No one could catch him so he had to be trapped and he was brought to a warehouse.  He spent the first weeks in a foster home hiding behind the toilet in a bathroom. (see pic) He was very young (under a year old) and small, and when he came here to Almost Home Rescue of FL he was terrified of people. He has been here with us over 2 YEARS now, and he is approx 3 yrs old and still waiting to find a home with a special someone who will understand him and love him for who he is.  He has made some strides from the scared little puppy he was when we first met him. The other dogs here at the foster home have helped him learn to start to trust and he began to allow us to touch him and pet him.  He is still not allowing us to pick him up or put a leash on him, she can not walk on a leash.  He MUST have a safe fenced yard so he can go out to the bathroom.  He is crate trained and loves his crate.  ONLY APPLY TO ADOPT BUDDY if you are someone who understands that BUDDY will be a long term project and will take months or years of patience, .     A SECURELY FENCED YARD IS AN ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT!!! HE CAN NOT WALK ON A LEASH OR BE PICKED UP. Maybe someday, but not yet. \n  -----------------------------------\n ALL DOGS ADOPTED FROM ALMOST HOME RESCUE ARE SPAYED OR NEUTERED, MICROCHIPPED, VACCINES UP TO DATE AND HEARTWORM TESTED. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------TO BE CONSIDERED TO ADOPT A DOG FROM ALMOST HOME RESCUE YOU MUST FIRST COMPLETE THE ADOPTION APPLICATION. YOU WILL FIND THE ONLINE FORM HERE -\nhttp://www.almosthomedogrescue.org/FL849form.html\nIf you have questions please email us at: AlmostHomeRescue@gmail.com\nPLEASE READ!\n1. Jack Russell Terriers need homes with a secure fence. Underground fencing is NOT safe for a Jack Russell.\n2. Jack Russell terriers are bred to be hunting dogs and are not suited to apartment or condo life. The hunting instincts and prey drive cannot be trained out of these terriers and they will stay active in this way all their lives.\n3. We do not adopt Jack Russell Terriers to families withe small children (under 6) as terriers are not patient with the antics of a small toddler.\n4. Jack Russell Terriers can not safely coexist in a home with cats, birds, ferrets, hamsters, rabbits, etc, as terriers were bred to hunt and can kill small animals. They are hunters and they never give up.\n5. Please keep an open mind and consider your lifestyle both today and 10 years from now before you apply for a dog that may not be a good fit for the long run.",

He gets along with people and some dogs very well but he is not crazy about cats. \nKyle is very handsome and very obedient. Crate trained but doesn\u2019t love it. He would do better with a fenced yard, maybe a big farm but he still pretty clumsy around the house. Kyle can spend time by himself in a kennel or a yard because he is used to that.\nKyle was kept on a chain for long time and would love spending his older years with a family who can give him some love.",

            "description": "Princess is a 3-year-old German Shepherd and is ready to find her happily ever after! This sweet, cuddle bug of a German Shepherd loves to play but is still learning how to play appropriately. She LOVES traveling anywhere you want to go and is currently learning and working on good leash manners. Princess needs a family dedicated to training her in basic obedience using positive reinforcement and consistency. She has done well with dog-savvy children that she knows well, but she barks and growls (with wagging tail) at others. Princess prefers to be the only pet in her new home so if you have other animals, she would not be the best fit for you! She comes to you already potty trained and kennel trained. She has a medium-high energy level so she needs a fenced yard where she can run and play. She just needs to right family to come along and scoop her up and love her forever!\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Princess is $350, which is TAX DEDUCTIBLE, and goes toward providing supportive services to animals in the home, as well as the high cost of vetting our dogs in rescue. If you would like to welcome Princess into your home, please begin by submitting our Adoption Application. The adoptions for all of our dogs will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver the dogs. If you would like to learn more about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue, or donate to our dogs, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com.

            "description": "Evita is 8 years old. She has been around children but is not anxious to be with them. She doesn't respond to their attempts to play with her. She will keep her distance around anyone new. She hasn't warmed up to many and it's taken a long time for her to feel comfortable around them. She is easily startled by sudden sounds and movements. Evita doesn't tell you, as she seldom makes a sound, when she has to go outside, but will, most times, show you by walking or running and waiting at the door. You have to keep an eye on her. She has had an occasional accident. There are times she has to go out at any hour of the night. She will walk, or trot around in hopes someone will hear her or see that she wants to go outside before she heads for the door. Evita has ongoing medical problems that require frequent vet checks. She suffers from infections of her ears, eyes, and skin and joint pain. All must be treated once or twice a day with prescribed pills, ointments, mousse, and cleansers. Medicated baths are required every week or two. She also had a cancerous nodule removed and she is checked regularly for that but no other treatment needed has been required.\n\nAn adoption application is required but does not commit you to adoption. For the application and information about the adoption process, please visit  www.bhrg.org.",

She was rescued off the streets by a volunteer with Halfway to Home. Callie is a loving girl with women but she doesn't like most men. Lots of love, good-quality human companionship, playtime and daily exercise will be a must for Callie. When she is thoroughly settled in her new Forever home, she will benefit from positive basic obedience training to help with leash training and the bonding process. Once Callie has bonded with her new owner, she will be a loyal canine companion. She is crate trained. For more information on Callie, please call Sandy at tele # 661-824-4495 (this is a land-line phone).\n\nShe is very busy so would easily knock over a small child. She needs training so if you aren't an experienced dog person please be willing to get her into training classes. We do not take Callie to Petco because of her behavior.\n\nAt the rescue Callie is housed with Sergeant and they are walked together.\nSergeant has been adopted so now Callie is housed with Lorenzo and they are walked together.",

I love to play with toys and get enthusiastic about my leash and try to walk myself! I am awesome in my kennel, and I have great house manners. Sadly, I was born with some brain damage, so I struggle with some balance and coordination issues. I also have some severe allergies so I am on a special prescription diet and occasionally need injections to keep the allergies under control. \n\nMy adoption fee is $200. This includes my neuter surgery, vaccines, deworming, microchip with registration, free wellness exam, and 30 Days of Pet Insurance.\n\nTo find out how you can meet me, start by completing an adoption application online at www.ruffpatchrescue.com. You can attend one of our adoption events held most Saturdays, 10am to 1pm at the Riverton Petsmart.",

For this reason, and the fact that he becomes incredibly stressed in the car, it is vital that we find an adoptive home in the DFW area.",

Still, he is VERY timid and does not like when people approach him.  Zeke\u2019s fearfulness makes it so he will need a very special home.  You see, Zeke will likely never be a \u201ctypical dog\u201d.  He struggles with leash training as ALL people can be very intimidating, including the one holding the leash.  He also has had difficulty learning basic obedience as most of his training has centered around making him more comfortable with affection from humans.  He needs a calm/quiet environment with someone that  has the time & patience to work with him.  \n\nEven with training and patience he may never be a dog that enjoys any type of outings or visits from strangers.  A sturdy fence is a must as he will bolt in fear if he hears loud noises and will be unable to be recaptured without the use of a professional trap (trust us on this one)!",

She thinks she's a lap dog! Phoenix is working on basic commands. She is potty trained and crate trained. She would prefer to be the only dog in the house, or another easy going male dog would be okay with her too. Phoenix loves her people, and is waiting patiently for her forever family! Phoenix does need a home with a fenced in yard. She needs a home with no cats.\n\nPhoenix is vaccinated for rabies, distemper, and bordatella. She is spayed and is microchipped. Phoenix's adoption fee is $350 plus WI state tax!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Phoenix, please fill out an application at luckypawsmidwest.org. Once your application is approved, we can set up a time for you to meet her!\n\nLucky Paws Midwest is licensed and inspected by the State of Wisconsin: 402655-DS",

I would make someone a wonderful walking or jogging partner!  \nI am potty trained and know my basic commands. I can sit, shake and lay down. I even walk pretty good on leash!   When I play... I am like a giant puppy, so I could use to learn a few play manners, but I am smart and eager to please! \nI am good with most other dogs with proper introductions.  Not sure about those little furry things you all call \"cats\" though.  I don't know if I have ever met one.  I need to go to a home with no children because I can play a little too rough\nIf you think you can open your heart and home to me... please fill out an adoption application at: \n                   www.dawghous.com \nThank You!",

            "description": "Meet Meego... This sweet boy and his siblings  came to us from a high kill shelter where they were at risk of euthanasia due to overcrowding crowding. The day we got them sadly the whole litter broke with parvo. Thankfully the virus was caught early and all three beat it. We believe these babies are plott hound/terrier mixes They are 1 year old and around 40ish lbs. All  are super sweet and playful. Meelo and Meego are both timid in new situations. They are pups that will require patience to settle into a new family! They are great with dogs and cats. Small children will probably intimidate them. Meego is a bit more timid than his brother but loves to lounge in the recliner with his foster mom and we would love to see him so this with his own family since these boys grew up in foster care since 3 months old.  Meego is  utd, hw neg (tested below detectable levels) and altered. \n\nAll dogs have a $175 adoption fee which includes vet check, age appropriate shots (atleast 2 sets for puppies), dewormer, heartworm test (if over 6 months), rabies (if atleast 16 weeks) and spay/neuter! Puppies will be altered before adoption. All rescues and shelters practice pediatric spay and neuter. This is essential in our rescue efforts and it is a policy that we will stick by. All dogs over 8 weeks and 2 pounds will be altered before adoption. There are no exceptions to this rule on all healthy and adoptable dogs. \n\nPuppies/Dogs that are not available for adoption due to vetting not being complete can be reserved with an approved application and a non refundable $50 deposit. This deposit is applied to your adoption fee and the remaining $125 is due at pick up.\n\nWags and Whiskers is an all-volunteer rescue. We also have full-time jobs and Families. We will try to answer all questions and applications in a timely manner. Please be patient and bear with us . Do not contact Parkway Animal Hospital as they are a vet clinic and can not answer questions on behalf of Wags and Whiskers. All questions and comments must go directly through the rescue. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION\n\nhttps://form.jotform.us/70898112177159\n\n",

            "description": "Meet Meelo... This sweet boy and his siblings  came to us from a high kill shelter where they were at risk of euthanasia due to overcrowding crowding. The day we got them sadly the whole litter broke with parvo. Thankfully the virus was caught early and all three beat it. We believe these babies are plott hound/terrier mixes They are 1 year old and around 40ish lbs. All  are super sweet and playful. Meelo and Meego are both timid in new situations. They are pups that will require patience to settle into a new family! They are great with dogs and cats. Small children will probably intimidate them. Meelo is a walking miracle because not only did he beat parvo but he had a terrible blockage in his intestine which required emergency surgery and his intestine to be cut in 8 places to remove all that was stuck inside. He does have to have his hard kibble moistened down with water for it to pass easily but other than that he wasn\u2019t left with any lasting effects!  Meelo is  utd, hw neg (tested below detectable levels) and altered. \n\nAll dogs have a $175 adoption fee which includes vet check, age appropriate shots (atleast 2 sets for puppies), dewormer, heartworm test (if over 6 months), rabies (if atleast 16 weeks) and spay/neuter! Puppies will be altered before adoption. All rescues and shelters practice pediatric spay and neuter. This is essential in our rescue efforts and it is a policy that we will stick by. All dogs over 8 weeks and 2 pounds will be altered before adoption. There are no exceptions to this rule on all healthy and adoptable dogs. \n\nPuppies/Dogs that are not available for adoption due to vetting not being complete can be reserved with an approved application and a non refundable $50 deposit. This deposit is applied to your adoption fee and the remaining $125 is due at pick up.\n\nWags and Whiskers is an all-volunteer rescue. We also have full-time jobs and Families. We will try to answer all questions and applications in a timely manner. Please be patient and bear with us . Do not contact Parkway Animal Hospital as they are a vet clinic and can not answer questions on behalf of Wags and Whiskers. All questions and comments must go directly through the rescue. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION\n\nhttps://form.jotform.us/70898112177159\n",

She should not be in a home with cats and would be best in a home as the only pet as she is very dog selective. She can be wary of new people but meets them well in a controlled and managed setting.  She should be in an adult only home with dog-savvy individuals who can spend time exercising and training her. She is very smart and treat motivated and she is easy going in a home environment and when she knows you, she will be your best couch cuddle buddy - plus she enjoys walks and car rides!",

She must sit upright to eat food and wait upright for 10-15 minutes afterward in order to digest properly.  Purchase of a Bailey Chair is the demand but thereafter she does well with any food.  This is a relatively common condition found in German Shepherds but she needs a dedicated owner who is committed to managing the condition.  It is for life.  \nWhile Pie\u2019s brother turned out extra large Pie is on the smaller size of about 45 pounds but is till growing and filling out.  Pie is very smart, crate trained and knows basic commands.  She does need leash training and would adore being part of her special family. She gets along with any other dog but can be pushy as part of wanting to play all the time.  She is tolerant of cats but tries to wrestle with them as if they are puppies and is better monitored when with them.  Pie is a GIFT to that special someone.  She bonds with humans intensely and loves to learn the right way to be.  If you have a big heart and a firm concept of the demands of a special needs dog, kindly email tristateshepherdrescue@gmail.com for an application.\n",

OUR CONTACT IS THROUGH FACEBOOK MESSENGER. https://www.facebook.com/REDRescueEveryDog/\n\nThis companion animals name is Choco. Choco is a kind and playful dog, who adores his dog friends, along with hanging with his people. He is a good citizen with other canines, and he requests a secure fenced yard and friends for him to romp and run with. Choco learns to trust his people, though he is not always so sure of new people. Choco is smart and loves cookies, chewy bones, and other toys and treats. He came to us as a nearly feral dog, and although he has come incredibly far with us, he is not perfect. He thrives in a place that doesn't have huge expectations for him. He has yet to come to understand walking on lead, and it is unclear whether this will ever truly happen. He likes to come and sit with you and hang out where you are, and it is well worth getting to know him. We are hoping to find someone dedicated to bringing him to be the best boy he can be, with an understanding of shy dogs. <br>Mandatory fenced yard. No apartments. Some Condos and homes with a  private use fenced yard maybe considered. No children under 12 years of age, with a preference for adult only homes. Adoption donation for this companion animal is $200.

            "description": "Have you ever seen a dog who wags not just their tail but their whole body? Well, that is Nicco - the happiest, go-lucky dog around!\n\nNicco is a 6-year-old American Bulldog mix (1/30/13) who is ready to find his forever home. Nicco is truly the happiest, go-lucky dog around. He smiles with his whole face, and when he wags his tail, he can't help but wag his whole body.\n\nNow, Nicco is pretty exuberant, so it is probably best for him to be in a home without small children. He also seems to be a little too fond of the kitties, so no felines for him. He walks well on a leash and loves to play outside with his foster brother, who is his size, but Nicco doesn't seem to care too much for smaller dogs. He is completely potty trained, and neutered, so he doesn't mark anywhere. He doesn't mind being in his crate, and will sleep all night there, but also loves to cuddle up with a human for the night if you let him.\n\nNicco sounds pretty good doesn't he? So, come meet him!\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online at http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.",

            "description": "Look at this pudgy little face. Makes you want to pinch his little cheeks. But get to know this little guy first. It's not that he isn't a great dog; he is! He just takes a little time to warm up to people. And when he does, it is such a great feeling because he loves with all his little heart. His foster mom says it is so sweet to see him seeking love and accepting attention.\n\nMeet Sisco! Sisco is an almost 7-year-old, 16-pound, neutered male Chihuahua mix. He has a gorgeous, short, tan and white coat. He is house and crate trained (but his foster says Sisco spent too much time in a crate prior to his rescue, and he is fine out of his crate-so, she seldom crates him). And he walks very nicely\non-leash\nbut will pull a little. Because Sisco wasn't socialized when younger, he tolerates other dogs but doesn't really interact. So Sisco will make a great only dog.\n\nSisco will need a patient adopter who will give him time to adjust to a new environment, and he will reward you by bestowing his love and allowing you to see him blossom into a sweet, loving, little guy. Sisco does have diabetes, but his condition is easily treated by insulin shots twice a day. And he does well with little ones who are good with dogs; he seems fascinated by them and follows them around (but supervise them so Sisco doesn't get hurt).\n\nYou can apply to adopt Sisco at the website shown below.\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online at http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.",

            "description": "Hi, I'm Rowling. I'm about 4-years old and weigh 69 pounds. I tend to prefer other dogs my size or bigger, who are calm and easy-going and have mostly been around males.\n\nI'm still learning to trust humans. Humans were not very nice to me in my previous life, so I'm shy around them. That's why I must have a home with another friendly, confident, loving dog (my size or larger) to help me learn people can be good. My fur-foster brothers, a Golden/Shepherd mix and a Newfie/Great Pyrennes mix give me the confidence I need to hang out with my human family. However, I need a buddy who is easy going, and not going to want me to play. I'm not a dog that likes to play. I'm a homebody and playing is scary for me. That means I need a dog friend who accepts me just the way I am. But I'm not a fan of cats or smaller dogs though.\n\nMy foster mom says I need a home where there is more than one person, so I don't get attached to just one...I might become too protective of an only pack member. I'm good with kids, older elementary or middle/high school would be best, who are dog-savvy, experienced with larger dogs, and will respect my fears and personal space and not push me out of my comfort zone. I am easily startled by loud noises and movements and it causes me to bark a lot in fear. I'm not much of a cuddler, and again, not wanting to play. So if you are looking for a dog to play with kids or other dogs, and cuddle, dress up, or expect lots of affection from, that is not me.\n\nI really am a super-sweet, extremely gentle guy though and I'm just looking for a family who will respect that. I've worked with some of the best trainers over the years but my anxieties from my past, just get the best of me So maybe you can be very patient, loving, and calm with me? I am unsure and scared of leash walks, so a securely fenced yard is something I MUST have. Dog parks, doggie daycare, dog walkers or dog walking services, wouldn't work for me as I don't like all dogs and new people can make me nervous. I also am not at all athletic ( I had heartworms previously) and I have to catch my breath on walks so it isn't my favorite thing. If you like to travel, a pet sitter who can visit me at my home, and let me out in the yard to do my business would be just perfect. I don't do well with even the shortest of car rides, they tend to stress me and my tummy gets really upset.\n\nI am very smart and can give kisses on command when I am feeling confident, if I trust you. You can't help but fall in love with me. I'm so adorable! Because I lived outside on a chain, on occasion, I do still have a wet accident inside even though I do consistently potty outside. So be sure to take me out on a schedule and sleeping in my crate, helps me with this.\n\nI love my big crate and sleep in it at night and when my family leaves for work during the day, it's my own safe place where I feel safe (it gives me a break from the humans).\n\nI have quickly learned to sit for treats and food, and I am very gentle. I do have allergies, and I am on a prescription diet food that has helped me with this.\n\nMy family did a DNA test and I came back a Heinz 57 mix -- that means I'm basically an adorable mix of many breeds! Some American Staffordshire Terrier, some Lab, some Boxer, some Cocker Spaniel, and miscellaneous other breeds.\n\nI know my perfect family is out there somewhere, and I sure hope they find me too\n\nPlease fill out an application to let my foster mom know if you think you would be a great fit. I need a very special home.\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online. http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nMake a donation in this dog's name at http://www.angelsrescue.org/donate.\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org",

I get so excited when my Foster Mom brings out the kiddie pool and I can practice my doggie paddle! It's so much fun! I also love all people and even those little ones that Foster Mom calls 'children,' although I don't have any of those in my foster home. I even like going to restaurants where they allow dogs - I always nap on the floor quietly - unless someone orders a burger- and then I politely sit for a bite! I sure would love a forever home, and maybe even one with my own kiddie pool, because I have to share mine with my doggie foster brothers and sisters. Do you want to see me swim? I'd love to show you! If so, please contact my Foster Mom, Mary, at mary800@bellsouth.net.

I'm 100% housetrained and I'm crate-trained, although my favorite spot in the house is wherever my foster mama is! I love to cuddle up on the couch with her or sleep as close to her as I possibly can. When I'm not snuggling I love to play! My best friends are doggies Ruby and Benjamin, and we love to race around the yard and play tug of war with anything we can find, or \"swim\" in the baby pool our foster mama puts out for us! I can get over-excited sometimes so I'm probably best in a home by myself where I can get all the attention, or with another balanced dog my size or bigger, male or female. You see, I sometimes don't want to share my food or my human or toys because when I just a puppy, I developed a growth in my jaw and I could barely open my mouth to eat or bark or do anything. My family couldn't afford to get me the care I needed so they reached out to some Angels who took me in and got the growth removed from my mouth and now I'm good as new! I can now eat and carry toys in my mouth and kiss my foster mama and do all the things I couldn't do before! I'm so grateful that I'm a normal dog now that I just want to love on my foster mama all day long to show her! I would love to love on you, too, if you think you would like that?

Be stunned by her super-dog feats of \"ball-manship!\" Watch her leap tall bushes to save little children, so she can love them!\n\nFernanda is a 4-year-old, 55-pound, female, pittie mix. Fernanda truly is an amazing dog. People call her the sweetest girl you will ever meet, but what does that mean? It means she loves everyone. She loves to run and play, so a fenced in yard would be the ideal outdoor environment for her. Fernanda also loves children and loves to lay next to you because she just adores being with her people! Fernanda's ideal indoor environment would be one where she is the \"only furry child\" and receives lots of love and attention from her family.\n\nFernanda \"literally\" will ask you to throw her ball until you are too tired to throw, and she will bring it back every time! Fernanda is house, crate, and leash trained, and she knows all her basic commands. She is also a world-class kisser with an infectious smile and a wiggle butt.\n\nRemember how excited you were when the circus came to town. That's how Fernanda makes you feel everyday - it's hard to be down with Fernanda around.\n\nYou can apply to adopt Fernanda at the web address below. At least come meet this girl and give her a chance to show you her fetch skills.\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online. http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.\n\nMake a donation in this dog's name at http://www.angelsrescue.org/donate.\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org",

I'm also a smart girl and very obedient, but also very playful. And I don't chew on anything that isn't mine to chew.\n\nDo you like to walk? Well, I love walks, hikes, and being outdoors with my human. Are you a runner? I love to run. Will you take you with me?\n\nI do prefer being the only pet in a home as other dogs/cats scare me! And while I'd love to have some human siblings, the older ones are best because I'm pretty energetic. That's not too much to ask, is it?\n\nSo what do you say? Please ome meet me and get one of those big kisses!\n\nParty\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online: http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms.\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.",

            "description": "Bruno is a special boy who will need a special owner to meet his special needs. He is a 6-year old paraplegic pitbull mix who has partial back legs. Bruno gets around well using a \u2018drag bag\u2019 and has his own set of wheels and is unaware of his disability. He is convinced he is the same as any other dog and acts like any other dog\u2026although you will most likely find he is the happiest dog you have ever met. He gets along well with dogs and wants to play and has lived with cats. He may knock over small children as he is exuberant and does not go through life at a low speed when he is moving about. He does require time and devotion to care for as he is incontinent and has \u2018sensitive\u2019 skin. He is well behaved and patient during diaper changing time.\n\nBruno holds a special place in the hearts of all the people he has touched. We all want what is best for him and we want to make sure he goes to a home who can provide for all of his special needs. Castaway has invested a lot of time and resources into getting Bruno to the point where he can find his forever home. We'd love to find a family to keep us in the loop of how he is doing.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please go to our website at www.castawaypetrescue.org and fill out an adoption application. An adoption counselor will contact you. Please note that adoption counselors will only know of your interest if you submit an application. They do not see emails sent to the administration email account. The adoption counselor can answer your questions when they call after receiving your application. Please remember we are an all volunteer organization.\n\nMinimum Adoption Donation is $250 (includes deworming, microchip with free registration, age appropriate vaccinations, spay and 30 days of health insurance). Any donation above the minimum is appreciated\n\nFoster Home Location: Libertyville, IL\n\nOur organization uses 24PetWatch microchips, which include free registration into the 24PetWatch pet recovery service.

While I am good with the females I\u2019ve met, I am selective about the male dogs I choose to be my friend.  I am a boxer/lab mix.  \n\n That said, I adore ALL humans.   Nothing makes me happier than being loved and brushed.   I just finished  a dental so my teeth are a beautiful pearly white!  \n\nI love a fenced in yard and am accustomed to loads of room to run so this is a must.    However, I do want to live indoors too so I can snuggle with my human.    I love walks and was house trained in the past\u2026.I know I\u2019ll remember this with a little coaching!     I\u2019m also crate trained but prefer hanging out on a dog bed or sofa!   \n\nPlease submit an application https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScQdDE-DiJlcc_99y9QLIxFNWTNRGemaxJewaoED0jukONdMQ/viewform \n",

Drew is the kind of Border Collie that reads your mind with his eyes, attention to body language, and wicked smart.  He can be a hyper typical teenage Border Collie, who loves to work/think at home and on the leash.  Cuddly with great curls and an awesome air kiss hug trick.  This pup just enjoys life so much and loves to play.  He is great with any training incorporating it into play in the yard, on the leash, and with special toys enjoying new games. Drew is looking for an experienced dog person who understands the sensitivities of the Border Collie; lots of room to run and play; 6 foot Wooden Fence; human break during a work day.  His litter came to my rescue July 4th 2014 at 4 months of age which is a prime life experience for any dog.  Drew overcame a lot of fears and had some imprinting from the owner reaching/grabbing.  All the 8 puppies were running free on her 3 acres in Louisiana, pretty dang scary for young herders.  He is still learning about strangers and how they should approach him for the best positive experience so he can play with them and give those amazing kisses!  Drew would do great in a home that can further his understanding of the world, create fun games when playing outside, enjoy taking \u2018working\u2019 walks/hills walks-hikes (away from sidewalk and using tricks) settling in for the day.  I do feel he would benefit from another dog in his home that is on his activity level and enjoy fun BC/Aussie play or play dates with dogs he\u2019s met on leash walk. Also, he would do well with a BC experienced school age child. He crates nicely with a break during a work day, a 6 foot fence is required, and owners that follow his diet as his colon is super sensitive. All of his training/diet have been laid out for the next journey in his life! If an out of area applicant would be a potential match it is required they come to Houston to meet Drew and potentially stay a few days to further the matching process.  There is an application and home visit required, adoption $300",

She doesn't see well but likes to explore and is happy to make new friends. Her owner seemed to be taking good care of her, as she came to the shelter with extensive veterinary records, but for some reason she wasn't wanted anymore and was left there to die. Precious is diabetic and takes insulin twice a day, which is a difficult condition for the shelter to handle- they did not plan on being able to keep her there long, but luckily we had space and she made the long trip up from South Carolina. \n?\nWe've never had a pet with diabetes before and were a little nervous about keeping up with Precious' meds, but she takes her injections with no problems and the insulin is very inexpensive. Precious is also on a prescription food for urinary issues, but she doesn't eat much so that's no big deal either. All in all she has been a sweet, loving, and easy addition to our foster family, and we are so happy we were able to get her out of the shelter safely!",
