We will form a line like usual based on who has an active and approved application in. We will go through our line to set up a private meet and greet for potential adopters to foster.\n307-739-1881\nadopt@animaladoptioncenter.org\n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/42994530730154\n\nGimli\n5 month old, male, Reservation mix, medium size\nMeet Gimli! Gimli describes a reservation mutt and is likely made up of 5+ breeds to make his cute face. He will likely be about medium size and we can speculate 40-60lbs. He was found as a stray on the Wind River Reservation and no one came to claim him at the Paws For Life Riverton shelter. He is still a young puppy and will benefit from an owner willing to put in some basic training. He has done well with all walks of life so far and is going to make a great companion!\n\nPlease note, Animal Adoption Center cannot guarantee the breed, composition or ages of our dogs as we usually have no history prior to them entering the rescue. We make every effort to ensure the dogs are healthy.\n\nPlease know that our intention is to insure long lasting committed homes for the animals at the AAC. If we feel that an animal and a potential owner are not a good fit we reserve the right to refuse adoption.",

Our rescue covers microchip, vaccinations to her adoption date, and spaying at one of our veterinarians when she's old enough.\n\nMeet Riley!!! Riley is an eleven-month-old female Lab mix pup! She has lots of energy and she LOVES to snuggle ?She enjoys going on walks and is really good at sitting before crossing the street ?? Her hobbies include fetching, playing with other dogs, licking the peanut butter out of a hollow bone, stealing my spot on the bed then refusing to move, waking her fosters up in the morning by licking their faces, and following them everywhere they go (an adorable stage 5 clinger\u201d) ?\n\nRiley had a rough start to life ? She had owners who isolated her from any contact for most of her life.  She was then surrendered to us when they didn\u2019t have time for her anymore ? As a result, she can get a little scared when she meets new people and sometimes nervous when going on walks at night or when she hears unfamiliar sounds. Her fosters started doing basic training with her and she\u2019s so eager to learn more.  She thrives with constant affection and gives it in return. We are looking for a family for Riley who has a backyard, doggy sibling and will continue to work with her and gain her love and trust\n\n\n**If you're interested in Riley, you must visit our website and fill out an application here: https://bigloveanimalrescue.org/adoption-application-form/\n\n**No meet and greets prior to approved application.\n\n**Due to the volume of messages we receive on all of our platforms, we do NOT send follow up emails to our applicants and do not reply to messages here on PetFinder. We\u2019re a small, volunteer ran rescue so we can only do so much in 24 hours. Thank you for understanding!\n\nAgain, please no repeat emails. If we feel you're the right fit, we will contact you.\n\nwww.bigloveanimalrescue.org",

I'm about 3-4 years old and I'm a Corgi/Beagle mix. I've got the body of a Corgi, (including the large ears and deliciously juicy thighs), with Beagle markings.\n\nMy foster Mom says I'm a good girl because I'm house\ntrained, good\n\nwith other dogs and leash\n\ntrained! I love to go for walks but get a little anxious on car rides.\n\nI love a lot of things, for instance, WATER!! I love to play with it and get all wet! I also LOVE TOYS, there are these special ones my foster parents got me that I love to chase, retrieve and just keep in my mouth. Sometimes I ever fall asleep with it in my mouth. I love to snuggle on the couch and one the bed. Oh and food...yeah, food is definitely a favorite. Plus I'm a sucker for treats!\n\nOf course, I'm not perfect, I lick the ground when I get anxious.\n\nMy fosters have tried working with me but it is what it is. We all can't be perfect. I've also got quite the sniffer, m\n\ny humans swear I can smell a flea fart in the wind.\n\nAll in all, I am a happy girl that loves to play and snuggle. I sleep in my own bed but it's a real treat when my humans allow me in bed with them. I enjoy walks, my toys, treats and playing in water. I get along well with other dogs and I'm curious about cats.\n\nIf you're looking for an all around happy girl who loves to cuddle, please visit idohr.org and complete an adoption application.\n\nPlease visit our website if you would like to submit an adoption application.\n\nJett's Adoption Donation Fee is $325. Jett i\n\ns spayed, current on all vaccinations, has received a wellness exam and is microchipped.\n\nI Dream of Home Rescue, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) Non-Profit Organization.\n\nTAX ID: 81-0780050\n\nI Dream of Home Rescue\nPO Box 7612, La Verne, California 91750\n\nwww.idohr.org\n\nwww.facebook.com/IDOHR.ORG",

Margie is in foster care with other dogs and puppies of all sizes and ages, she does great with all but she is a quiet girl with lower energy and likes to nap a lot and keep you company, she loves her mealtimes and is treat motivated, we do not know if she has met a cat and she is a super EASY KEEPER...she is great with all people and will be a wonderful family member. Margie will follow along slowly on a leash and she is a 100% house trained, spayed, micro chipped with all vaccinations, she is ready to go to her forever home and get all the love and pets she deserves. \n\n\nAn application must be filled out and accepted before a meet can be set up. If accepted, you will hear from us within 72 hours. You will have the opportunity to ask questions before you meet the pet; an adoption may or may not happen at that time. We do adopt outside the Yakima area IF you are able to come to Yakima to pick up your adopted pet.  We do not have a kennel facility; all of our pets are in foster homes. Therefore, meets and adoptions take place at either our office or at a place chosen by the foster.   If a pet has 'pending' beside its name, an adoption is imminent. Please fill out an application anyway because adoptions don't always go through. Your application will be kept on file for 30 days in case you find another pet you'd like to apply for.  Thanks for thinking adoption and Good Luck!",

Her little eyebrows show all her expressions. She is still a bit shy and is getting used to new things in her foster home. She likes dogs but would be perfectly happy without them. She LOVES kids and loves to snuggle. She's a very mature puppy! She will give you all the love if you give her time, she is such a sweetheart! Daisy's adoption fee is $400 which covers her spay, vaccinations appropriate at the time of adoption, microchip and any additional medical care she may have needed while in the rescues care.We are a foster based rescue, we do not house dogs at a facility. Age and breed, are NLR's best guess as we often don't know who or what mom and dad are. If you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application on our websitewww.northernlakesrescue.org",

Mr. Max is a handsome, senior guy who came to PACC with some medical issues. He's healing up, but he'd sure like to finish up his recovery in a soft, comfy home instead of the shelter. He also spent some time in PACC's decompression program for shy and scared dogs, but he's come a long way. In play group, Mr. Max was appropriate with his greetings and tolerant of the young whippersnappers that wanted to meet him. He wasn't too interested in affection from his handlers and mostly kept to himself and explored the yard. Mr. Max is a very special older gentleman who is looking for a very special person to call his own. He can be a bit cranky, but we know he's a big softie inside and would love to get out of the shelter and into a home. If you can help him out, make an appointment to meet him today.",

After spending some time in PACC's decompression program for shy and scared dogs, she's feeling a bit more confident and is ready to find a home of her very own. In play group, Kuvira mostly kept to herself. Staffers say she's a very sweet girl who loosens up after some gentle pets and quiet affection. Volunteers tell us she's a gentle, pretty girl who loves walks, treats (she's a big fan of cheese) and neck rubs. Kuvira is a shy sweetheart who would love to get out of the shelter and into a home with a person or people to shower her with love and affection. If you've got some room in your home and heart, make an appointment to meet Kuvira today.",

As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ.

I have a very sweet personality and love to give and receive affection. I'm still young so I have lots of playful energy and will need daily exercise. I know the commands for sit, paw, and stay, and would love to learn more! I was house trained in my previous home but adopters should be aware that most dogs will have a few potty accidents while they're adjusting to a new home. I'm looking for a committed adopter whose schedule and lifestyle allow plenty of time for an active young dog. I'm approved for respectful children aged 10 and up and will be an awesome addition to a loving family! Safira is approved for families with respectful children aged 10 and up.\n\nThe online adoption listing websites require that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We encourage you to select your new companion by considering each dog's individual personality and pet qualities instead of relying on a breed label that is only a guess.",

They take in Wadi dogs - dogs that are descended from the Saluki breed and native to the Middle East.  In Oman there are no animal control shelters for stray dogs, and they are generally just shot by the police.  This small rescue group takes in as many Wadi dogs as they can, and sends them to rescues in Europe and North America.  One of their volunteers was flying to Houston and brought Lindi to us.\n\nLindi is a sweet girl and loves people and other dogs.  Her foster mom in Oman was a dog trainer, so Linid is very well trained.\n\nLindi is very active and loves to play with other dogs.  We require her new home have another dog for her to play with.  She also needs a large yard in a quiet suburban or country setting.  City noises makes her uncomfortable.\n\nLindi loves to cuddle and has an adorable curly tail.\n\nFor more information, please contact info@redcollar.org.\nAdoption applications can be submitted on our website, redcollar.org.\n\nAge - 1 year\nWeight - 35 lbs.\nDogs - yes required\nCats - no\nKids - older kids okay\nVaccinated - yes\nSpayed - yes\nMicrochipped - yes",

He loves to play with his big sister and brother.  He is always happy and sweet to everyone.\n\nAdopters must live within a 100-mile radius of Joliet, IL to be considered. The adoption fee is $425 with $100 refundable deposit added.  This covers all shots, spay/neutering and microchip.\n\nTo be considered for this dog. Please fill out an application here: https://www.pawsup4rescue.org/dog-cat-applicaiton\n\nOur adoption process typically takes from one to two weeks. When you find an animal you are interested in, we ask that you fill out an application as a first step so we can determine if your family is a good fit for the animal. If you are, then we will contact you to arrange a time for you and your family to meet the animal so you can decide if it is a good fit. If you currently have dogs, we require that the dogs be present at the meeting to make sure it's a good fit all around. Once compatibility is determined, we move on to the paperwork and finalizing the adoption. \n\nIf the meet is not a good fit, we will keep your application on file for up to 1 year and we will gladly consider your family for another dog. \n\nFollow us on FACEBOOK: www.Facebook.com/PawsUp4Rescue/ \nand on INSTAGRAM: www.Instagram.com/Paws_Up_4_Rescue/",

Smart as whips, sweet as pie and super cute to boot, what's not to love about the S-Litter? Social butterflies, they're big fans of every person they come across and they'd never say no to some one on one people time! When they're not snuggled up with staff and volunteers, they love to romp in the MARL ball pit, run around in play groups with other dogs and take midday naps in cuddle puddles. If you've been looking to brighten up 2021, then come spend time with the S-Litter!\n\nCOMPATIBILITY: Based on our evaluation, we feel that the S-Litter has the potential to get along with other dogs and cats.\n\nMEDICAL NEEDS: The S-Litter has been diagnosed with demodectic mange and are currently receiving treatment. This type of mange is not contagious to other animals or humans. The S-Litter will need to continue getting medicated baths and oral medication until their skin is cleared by a MARL veterinarian. If you have questions about the S-Litter and their treatment, please call 248-335-9290.\n\nhttps://marleague.org/animal/s-litter/",

He is a sensitive boy that can be shy when first meeting new people, but once he warms up is a goofy boy who loves to play! Squeaky toys are the way to his heart, and he can't get enough of them. Gullivere recently had a femoral head osteotomy, so he would love some extra TLC in his new home! To help his recovery, he'd love going on slow walks and dancing on his rear legs can help strengthen his legs and speed up his recovery! Due to his shy nature, if there are children in his future home, they would need to be ages 13 and up. Gullivere can be dog selective so he would prefer to be the only dog in the home so that he can get all of your love! \n\nIf this lovable guy is pulling at your heart strings, give us a call to schedule an appointment to meet him today!",

She is fully grown and loves to snuggle! Suki is doing great on potty training, she has had very few accidents and is getting better every day. She gets along with ALL walks of life and she hasn\u2019t met a stranger yet. Suki is an energetic, athletic girl but will choose to snuggle over all else!  When she first meets you, it may take a moment to warm up, she is a little slower with men, but once she does, you can\u2019t stop the kisses and excited little grunts she makes when you come home! \n\nAdopters must live within a 100-mile radius of Joliet, IL to be considered. The adoption fee is $425. This covers all shots, spay/neutering and microchip.\n\nTo be considered for this dog. Please fill out an application here: https://www.pawsup4rescue.org/dog-cat-applicaiton\n\nOur adoption process typically takes from one to two weeks. When you find an animal you are interested in, we ask that you fill out an application as a first step so we can determine if your family is a good fit for the animal. If you are, then we will contact you to arrange a time for you and your family to meet the animal so you can decide if it is a good fit. If you currently have dogs, we require that the dogs be present at the meeting to make sure it's a good fit all around. Once compatibility is determined, we move on to the paperwork and finalizing the adoption. \n\nIf the meet is not a good fit, we will keep your application on file for up to 1 year and we will gladly consider your family for another dog. \n\nFollow us on FACEBOOK: www.Facebook.com/PawsUp4Rescue/ \nand on INSTAGRAM: www.Instagram.com/Paws_Up_4_Rescue/",

Taking short walks where I can take in the fresh air and sunshine is so much fun, and I even walk politely on a leash so it will be fun for you too! I already know how to \"lie down\" and give my \"paw\" too - I'm one smart lady! I enjoy the company of my human friends of all ages, but I like to keep the attention to myself, so I will need a home where I am the only dog. Make an appointment to meet me today!",

I'm hoping for a relaxed environment where I can grow and thrive in with time and lots of love. I would enjoy help boosting my confidence and maybe we can even work on boosting my socialization skills as well. I look forward to meeting you! Maybe with you by my side, I'll learn that the world isn't as scary as I think it is. See you soon!\n\nMake an appointment to meet me at AAWL's Main Shelter!\n\nhttps://aawl.org/content/appointment-based-adoptions\n\nAAWL recommends I live with humans HIGH SCHOOL AGE and older.\nAAWL says I MUST MEET potential doggy siblings at the shelter first.\nAAWL says I am a NOW AND THEN exercise.\nAAWL does not know if I can live with cats at this time.\n\nI'm Beemer's Buddy!

You could say I'm a driftin' cowboy. Originally from Georgia, plenty of rainy nights there, then I was over in South Carolina for a while, & now I'm up here in Minnesota. Let me tell ya, coming here in January may be the dumbest thing I've ever done! How do y'all LIVE like this!? & you're telling me this year is actually a mild Winter compared to most? How is a country boy supposed to survive!?I shoulda went out West to find me some Hollywood honeys! Oh well, beggars can't be choosers & all that, I guess. I can't change my tune now! Anyway, enough complainin'. Let me tell y'all a bit about myself. Now, I may be old in years, but I'm young at heart! I've still got plenty of kick left in my old bones! Obviously, being a hound, I've got a nose that never stops, so I'm always on the move & ready to go. So I'm more than capable of keeping up with whatever action you've got goin' on. Heck, I could probably still outlasy plenty of you young'ns! Although, I've had to sit in a kennel most days lately goin' from shelter to shelter, so I've been singin' the blues, but I'm still pretty positive most days! I'm not a huge fan of other animals, though. I definitely don't like cats, & I don't really get along with other dogs all that well either. Maybe the ones I've interacted with so far just haven't meshed well with me, but it'd probably be best if I was a one-animal guy. Overall, I'm just a lively guy lookin' for a new family to help settle down in this tundra I'm gonna have to get used to callin' home. I'd be a great exercise partner, family dog, whatever ya need!\n\nI'm up to date on shots, neutered, chipped, & ready to go! A also tested negative for heartworm. Come on over tonight & get yourself a Rowdy friend!",

            "description": "Meet Tugz \nThis female six month old puppers is a SWEETIE. It\u2019s hard to tell what she is, but our best guess would say she is a Lab/Husky mix, mix, mix, lol! We just know she is very pretty, with a beautiful creamy colored coat, gorgeous green eyes and expressive ears. She is still small at 27 lbs., but she might top out around 40lbs. So hard to say, but she is still pretty small. We rescued Tugz from a high kill shelter and brought her to the safety of ours. She is a lovely girl and is going to make for a wonderful family companion. \nTugz loves to play and is a lot of fun. She\u2019s left her past behind and relishes playing tug and running around. Tugz also loves to settle in a lap and be loved on. She\u2019s a blend of innocence and fun, sweet and smart. Tugz seems dog friendly and welcomes every opportunity to get out of her kennel to play and explore. She loves her toys too! She is afraid of cats, but we are hopeful she might get used to one if introduced slowly. Tugz enjoys being with people, she\u2019s very social and she shows us every day how grateful she is that she\u2019s been saved. Such a love!\nTugz travels well in a car and enjoys going on rides. We can\u2019t say enough good things about Tugz. If you are looking for a terrific young dog to welcome to your heart and home, Tugz may be for you. She will give you her whole heart and make your life that much better. She brightens our days and we know she will brighten yours. She\u2019s a little gem. \nIf interested in Tugz, please submit an application online at: https://www.charlessmithgallhumanesociety.org/page/dog-adoption-application \nOnce an application is submitted online, you will receive an email saying your application has been successfully submitted.  If you don\u2019t receive this email within 24 hours, please check to make sure all application fields were completed or please call our shelter at 706-865-4135. All adopters must complete an approval process which involves a reference check with current/recent vet and a brief home visit if located in the immediate area. We do permit out of state adoptions. Adopters MUST come to the shelter to transport their new family member home. We do not ship nor do we transport them to their new homes. Adoption policies and application procedures are detailed at the shelter website: http://smithgallhumanesociety.org/ under tab All Adoptable Animals.\nCharles Smithgall Humane Society (CSHS) is a No kill shelter. Animals in our care remain safe with us until adopted. Resident animals are primarily owner relinquished and also accepted from local Animal Control. The facility usually is operating at capacity with a list of animals waiting for space to open.\nAdoptions and meet and greets are being scheduled by appointment only. Please call our office, email us or complete an application and someone will be in touch just as soon as they can. \nLocation: 4823 Helen Hwy., Sautee, GA 30571, Phone: 706-865-4135\nEmail: smithgallhumanesociety@windstream.net\nOur shelter in Sautee GA is located about 3 miles south of the alpine town of Helen in northeast GA.",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Macaroni, but you can just call me Mac. I'm a pit/boxer mix, 2 years old, 56 lbs, & I have a tan & white coloring.\n\nI'll let you know right now that I can be a VERY stubborn boy! I need a lot of training when it comes to manners, leash-walking, & especially with not using my mouth so much. I'm a super rough player, & my very first instinct is to start biting. Not in a break skin sort of intention, but I've definitely left plenty of marks & bruises on people. Which is why I wouldn't be good in a home with small kids. I could easily injure a smaller person like that without even trying because I get so carried away. & similar to Wanda, another dog I came here with, I get really rough when it comes to other animals as well, so that could end badly if I'm with another dog & I get too aggressive with them while playing & they take it the wrong way. I'll definitely need someone who's willing to take an \"Alpha\" role over me. I might be stubborn, but I listen very well if I have a strict owner who knows what they're doing when it comes to training & doesn't put up with any BS! I'll easily take on the role of a follower if I have someone who's willing to put in the effort & be my leader. I'm the kinda guy who needs structure, not just any old family or owner will do! That's not to say I couldn't be a family dog of course, but I'll definitely need something to keep me busy & kept on a short leash so to speak until I learn my manners. I've never been aggressive with people or anything though, just the opposite! I'm a super snuggly & cuddly guy, I just don't really know how to behave myself is all. I've never had enough structure in my life to really know how! I'm definitely not a dog for the faint of heart, & I'll definitely require a lot of effort, but if you're someone who loves to train dogs or likes to challenge themselves, I could use someone just like you!\n\nI'm up to date on shots, neutered, chipped, & ready to go! I also tested negative for heartworm. If you're hungry for some pittie lovin', come get yourself some Macaroni!",

If a dog/puppy is still listed on Petfinder- we are still accepting applications for them**\n\nCanello is in a foster home in Houston, TX and can transport to the PNW mid February. \n\nCanello is the most handsome cuddly boy you'll ever meet! He was listed as 5 years old at the shelter, but we think he might be a little younger because this boy just loves to play! Our best guess at breed is a labrador retriever/pit mix. Canello was confiscated from his owner down in Houston, TX and taken to a high kill shelter. We do not know the circumstances surrounding why he was confiscated, but we imagine they weren't great :(  Canello was heartworm positive, but he has since undergone heartworm treatment to get rid of those yucky worms in his heart! He is now heartworm free & looking for his forever home! Canello was attacked by another dog in his foster home in Houston and ever since, he has not been the same with other pets :( He is very nervous around other dogs. Ever since his attack Canello has made it clear he does NOT like other dogs and will require a home with no other pets. We are willing to pay for 2 sessions with a trainer of our choosing for any adopter to work with. \n\nCanello is extremely sweet & gentle with children! In his current foster home he likes to play fetch outside with the neighbor's 3 year old. Canello would make a great running buddy and he'll also be your netflix & chill partner as he loves to cuddle up in your lap and sleep! Canello is not a huge fan of the crate, he'll go in it if he must, but he prefers to sit and wait for you by the door until you return home. Canello LOVES his squeaky toys and he loves to destroy them even more! This boy is just a ball of fun and will make the best addition to your family.\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess on age, breed and size when fully grown. We rarely know a dog's exact age nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time.\n\nThe first step in our process is filling out an application. We will review your application as soon as we are able- there are two of us and we do the best that we can. We review applications on a first come first serve basis and look for the best fit/match for dog and applicant.\n\nhttps://heartoftheunderdog.org/adoption-application\n",

            "description": "Happy Birthday Gary Groot!My siblings and I decided to sponsor this life saving transport to honor our father's 81st birthday. Our father, Gary Groot, is the main reason we are all animal lovers. We grew up watching and learning how to properly pamper our puppies and he instilled in us the importance of adoption; how it saves lives. My father just lost his beloved Precious who he loved with all his heart and took her everywhere, even bought a travel trailer so she could join him on mission projects for the church. Precious was by his side for the last 15 years and will now wait for him at the Rainbow Bridge. Suzanne, Karen & Tom\n\nLucy and her 5 siblings were born around January 7, 2020, and may top out in the 60-65 pound range. Please understand we are truly guessing on the breed for this family. Some of the siblings have a more Retriever look while others we feel have more of a Collie appearance to them. They are wonderful with the other dogs and adore us, humans. It is likely they did not have much human interaction while growing up and so we anticipate you will have some basic training to do. They are sweet-natured, intelligent, teens, so training should go smoothly. This is all we know so far and we will be learning as we go and so will you.\nThe Adoption Fee for this dog is $500.00\nAdoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a 'complete' pet. We accept CASH or Visa/Mastercard ONLY.\n\nJoyful Rescues has no funding except for our adoption fees and miscellaneous donations. Pet care and vet bills are expensive - you must be ready to take on this financial (as well as emotional) responsibility. YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 25 YEARS OF AGE TO ADOPT A DOG FROM JOYFUL RESCUES\n\nWe keep our pet list as up-to-date as possible. As soon as a pet is adopted, it is removed from the list. If a pet is still showing, it is still available for adoption.\n\nCan't Adopt Me? SPONSOR ME\nLook for the Link 'Special Instructions to Seller' if you want to note a particular pet\nBefore you seek to adopt a pet from Joyful Rescues, please read our Pet Adoption page http://www.joyfulrescues.org/pet_adoption.html.\n\nOnline Application",

It takes me quite a while to warm up to new people. My foster mom and dad have been really kind to me, and have won me over, but it took lots of time and lots of patience. I am food motivated, so bribing me with high value treats is a plus! My ideal home would be one where it is pretty quiet, without a lot of people who come and go. Kids in the home would need to be more in the 12ish and up range, and willing to be slow and gentle when working with me. If I had another dog to live with, I'd want it to be calm and confident. I don't really know how to play with other dogs. At just under 40 pounds, I'm a nice medium size. I'm not a great fit for a lot of homes, but there is the \"just right\" kind out there...I know it! If you think you might be able to help a sweet girl like me become the dog I was meant to be, we should meet!\n",

She's very food motivated, which will help when going over basic obedience training with her!Sadie gets along great with people and other dogs. We think she would do best in a home that offers her space to run around (so an apartment lifestyle may not suite her). A fenced-in yard would also be ideal, though this is not required. Sadie can jump on people when excited, so we also suggest that any children should be about 12 and older. Sadie is currently receiving treatment for heartworms.Animal meetings and adoptions by appointment only.

If a dog/puppy is still listed on Petfinder- we are still accepting applications for them**\n\nCanello is in a foster home in Houston, TX and can transport to the PNW mid February. \n\nCanello is the most handsome cuddly boy you'll ever meet! He was listed as 5 years old at the shelter, but we think he might be a little younger because this boy just loves to play! Our best guess at breed is a labrador retriever/pit mix. Canello was confiscated from his owner down in Houston, TX and taken to a high kill shelter. We do not know the circumstances surrounding why he was confiscated, but we imagine they weren't great :(  Canello was heartworm positive, but he has since undergone heartworm treatment to get rid of those yucky worms in his heart! He is now heartworm free & looking for his forever home! Canello was attacked by another dog in his foster home in Houston and ever since, he has not been the same with other pets :( He is very nervous around other dogs. Ever since his attack Canello has made it clear he does NOT like other dogs and will require a home with no other pets. We are willing to pay for 2 sessions with a trainer of our choosing for any adopter to work with. \n\nCanello is extremely sweet & gentle with children! In his current foster home he likes to play fetch outside with the neighbor's 3 year old. Canello would make a great running buddy and he'll also be your netflix & chill partner as he loves to cuddle up in your lap and sleep! Canello is not a huge fan of the crate, he'll go in it if he must, but he prefers to sit and wait for you by the door until you return home. Canello LOVES his squeaky toys and he loves to destroy them even more! This boy is just a ball of fun and will make the best addition to your family.\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess on age, breed and size when fully grown. We rarely know a dog's exact age nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time.\n\nThe first step in our process is filling out an application. We will review your application as soon as we are able- there are two of us and we do the best that we can. We review applications on a first come first serve basis and look for the best fit/match for dog and applicant.\n\nhttps://heartoftheunderdog.org/adoption-application\n",

He does great with other dogs and loves to play with them! He loves to run around with a ball or being chased. He would do great in a place with people that are able to take him out and play and go on fun adventures as he is a little hyper and energetic. He does need some training and obedience as he is still quite young, but he is very eager to please! Harley is the biggest sweetheart and would be the perfect companion! He is Neutered, Microchipped, and Up to Date on all vaccines. If you think you could give this good boy his furever home please fill out an application on our website at canyonviewcares.com or give us a call at 435-265-6040!",

If a dog/puppy is still listed on Petfinder- we are still accepting applications for them**\n\nCanello is in a foster home in Houston, TX and can transport to the PNW mid February. \n\nCanello is the most handsome cuddly boy you'll ever meet! He was listed as 5 years old at the shelter, but we think he might be a little younger because this boy just loves to play! Our best guess at breed is a labrador retriever/pit mix. Canello was confiscated from his owner down in Houston, TX and taken to a high kill shelter. We do not know the circumstances surrounding why he was confiscated, but we imagine they weren't great :(  Canello was heartworm positive, but he has since undergone heartworm treatment to get rid of those yucky worms in his heart! He is now heartworm free & looking for his forever home! Canello was attacked by another dog in his foster home in Houston and ever since, he has not been the same with other pets :( He is very nervous around other dogs. Ever since his attack Canello has made it clear he does NOT like other dogs and will require a home with no other pets. We are willing to pay for 2 sessions with a trainer of our choosing for any adopter to work with. \n\nCanello is extremely sweet & gentle with children! In his current foster home he likes to play fetch outside with the neighbor's 3 year old. Canello would make a great running buddy and he'll also be your netflix & chill partner as he loves to cuddle up in your lap and sleep! Canello is not a huge fan of the crate, he'll go in it if he must, but he prefers to sit and wait for you by the door until you return home. Canello LOVES his squeaky toys and he loves to destroy them even more! This boy is just a ball of fun and will make the best addition to your family.\n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess on age, breed and size when fully grown. We rarely know a dog's exact age nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time.\n\nThe first step in our process is filling out an application. We will review your application as soon as we are able- there are two of us and we do the best that we can. We review applications on a first come first serve basis and look for the best fit/match for dog and applicant.\n\nhttps://heartoftheunderdog.org/adoption-application\n",

Must have previous Belgian Malinos experience (other applicants will not be considered)\n2. Must work from home or less than 4 hours a day to continue potty training\n3. Must own a home with a secure fenced in yard\n4. All current pets must be spayed/neutered and up to date on heartworm prevention\n5. Home insurance must allow German Shepherd Breed\n\nIf you meet those requirement and would like to adopt Blaze, please visit www.dbgsdrescue.org\nSend in an application. Once approved, we will schedule a home visit and then a meet and greet with the pup.\nHis adoption fee is $300\n\nIF YOU SEE THIS POST, IT MEANS HE IS AVAILABLE AND WE ARE ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS.

So taking into account your own parameters for things such as size, coat care, activity level, etc please come and get to know our dog(s) as individuals to see if their personalities and yours are a forever match.\nPhone: (334) 567-3377 Fax: (334) 567-8774 E-mail: hselco@bellsouth.net",

            "description": "Becca is a 2-year old dog with a hard start to life. She was found walking in the middle of a street in a poor Mexican village while in labor. She was so disproportionately enlarged, with pups pressing out from her abdomen at all angles, that it was hard to look at her without crying. As soon as she arrived at a Bone Voyage foster house it was immediately evident that she needed a vet. Luckily there was a kind vet who waited for her arrival and cared for her through the birth of 12 pups (8 of which were born dead). The pups were very large, thus accounting for her looking so disproportionately enlarged. \n\nThe vet performed surgery believing there was a dead pup left and spayed her at the same time. The pups were raised by an experienced bottle feeder but only one survived. Becca spent two weeks loving life in a private courtyard of her own. Despite her living in an outside area she never soiled unless taken out for that purpose. \n\nAlthough minor compared to her pregnancy, it is worth noting that some jerks cut her ears believing that she looked like a cow and would look even more like a cow with different shaped ears. She is beautiful despite this, although it is painful to think of her experiencing that horror. \n\nDespite her struggle, she is a loving girl who is now at a board and train facility where she is getting along with a large pack of dogs at daycare and a smaller but still considerable size pack at home during the night. She is happy to be sleeping in bed with the daughter of her trainer and hopes to find a loving home of her own.\n\nCurrently in Mexico\n\nYOU MAY BE REQUIRED TO QUARANTINE UPON PICK UP. PLEASE TAKE THIS INTO CONSIDERATION AND DO NOT APPLY IF YOU CANNOT QUARANTINE",

Just coordinating with the vet to set up her spay which should be soon. \n\nHousebroken: Yes not a single accident. She will alert you if she has to go potty immediately. \n\nCrate trained: Yes. Her previous owner trained her to be left out of a crate and she does great. I have put her in a kennel for a little bit to see how she does and she has no problem with it walks right in lays down and goes to sleep \n\nGood in the car: Yes.\n\nGood on a leash: Yes she walks fine on a leash. Every once in a while she might pull slightly put I correct her and she remembers how to walk. \n\nEnergy level: Medium\n\nNeed a fenced in yard: Not really needed but she would love one! She loves to be outside chasing balls, running around, and being goofy \n\nDog Friendly: Yes loves other dogs \n\nIf yes, does your foster need another dog in its adoptive home? No \n\nCat Friendly? No!\n\nKid Friendly: she absolutely adores kids. Shes currently in a foster home with a 4 year old and a 5 month old. She loves to do tricks and run around with the 4 year old. And the 5 month old well ares could lay with her and lick drool and milk off her face all day and be as happy as could be \n\nIf yes, what's the youngest child you'd recommend they be placed with? Any age. Ares is very smart and very calm near the kids. Because of her size I would keep an eye on her if shes running around as she could accidentally knock a kid over but she would never hurt them on purpose. \n\nSpecial traits that make your foster special or that we need to know about them?\n\nAres came to us as a surrender. She was very well loved before coming to us and is very smart. Ares knows sit, stay, down, and paw (which she absolutely loves doing). she loves to spend her days cuddled up with you as you scratch her belly and she lounges around the house and her nights chasing a ball or running zoomies outside. Shes a calm girl but she also knows how to wrestle around and play when you get her going. Ares is a very goofy little dog and has us cracking up laughing everyday when she shows her goofy tricks. She loves being near her humans and other dogs and will do almost anything you ask for a yummy treat or a squeaky toy. Ares knows she is a princess and requires an extra special family that will love her to death, scratch her belly at least three times a day, and will feed her yummy yummy treats. If you think you can fufill her three simple wishes then come on over to grrde.org and fill out an application.",

She is such a cuddle bug bug and would love to go on beautiful hike with her new family.She is a ready to go girl and always ready to go on new adventures.She would be the best adventure partner. She is a smart and happy go lucky girl.She is very loving and she thinks shes a little lap dog.She loves car rides and would love a pup cup at Starbucks as a treat. She has tons of energy and would be well suited in a family with an active lifestyle. She would love another brother or sister to run around and play with that can match her energy.

She is a very sweet, timid girl. She was found on the side of the road in a very rural area. It looked like she had had puppies. A nice person took care of her and got her feeling better. She is now looking for her forever home. Mia needs another dog in the home since she is timid and would be best being able to follow another dog. She looks to other dogs for confidence and guidance. She is great with humans but super young kids may scare her since she is already shy. She has never been aggressive though. She does open up to women way faster than men. We think a man must have been mean to her in her past. She needs someone patient and gentle who will let her take her time warming up to her new home.

He does awesome with other dogs and enjoys playing with them and showing them all of his fun beagle noises he can make. And boy, can he make the beagle noises! He loves chew toys and chasing down toys but doesnt always return them to play fetch. Sharing in caring Clark! When hes done playing and its time to nap he loves to be on the couch cuddled up on his person's lap. Hes working hard on his manners and training. Clark is potty trained and does really well with going outside. Clark is in the process of completing an extensive training to help him correct some behaviors he developed from being shuffled around from place to place. A perfect family for Clark would be a family who is invested in continuing Clarks training. Clark gets along great with other dogs and cats. Clark is a little apprehensive as he has never had a loving home, therefore he would do best in a home with no or older children.\n\nHe will make an awesome companion and best friend for a future family that loves all of the traits and fun that comes with a beagle! \n\nClark is up to date on all shots, is heart worm free, neutered and micro-chipped. His adoption fee is $300, he is fostered in the Omaha area. Applications can be filled out at bassetandbeagle.org.",

Baxter has been vet checked, dewormed and received age appropriate vaccines.  ADOPTION FEE $375, $50 of which is returned to you once you have him neutered, which is required by 4-6 months of age.\n\nIf this is up, Baxter is still available. He is here in our facility.\nPlease fill out an application online.\nanimalwelfaresociety.net\n\n***DUE TO COVID, WE ARE OPEN BY APPOINTMENT ONLY.

I'd like to say that I am an incredible girl. I am full of love and Im seeking a special family to share the joys of my life alongside. I really love cuddling, but most importantly, I want to play with my toys and go on exciting adventures with my family. I am very protective of unknown outside noise and am never hesitant to let you know by gentle barking at the door. Along my journey, Ive enjoyed play dates with other dogs, meeting new people, and playing with Doggy IQ toys and bones. Ohhh, bones are my absolute favourite. I get cold easily, so I love having a blanket to cuddle. I can be clingy sometimes, and sometime will get upset if left alone from my humans for fur siblings. Im elated to meet my forever family and share all my love and joy for life with them.\n*The picture with the cone is after her spay.\nName: Alice May\nWeight: ~40 lbs\nAge: ~1.5 years\nGender: Female\nBreed: Boxer X\nColour: White with black spots\nMedical: No concerns\nFixed: Yes\nGood with adults: Yes\nGood with kids: 12+\nGood with dogs: YES, she loves doggy play time and would love to go to home with another dog\nGood with cats: No\nHouse trained: Yes\nCrate trained: Alice can be an escape artist and needs more work - probable separation anxiety\nCrate aggressive: No\nFood aggressive: No\nLeash trained: Yes, loves walks\nEnergy level: Very High\nSuitable for an apartment: No\nCan be handled: Yes\nBarker: Average",

He is currently being fostered with other dogs, cats and kids and we are requiring the adopter to continue his socialization and involve him in training throughout his life to make sure he is kept social and happy. Make sure you are ready to spend time and finances for training, supplies and arw ready to commit for the life of the dog before applying. Do you have a yard? Do you have the means to enroll him in training and comtimue his socialization? Do you have the space he needs now AND as an adult/senior? \n\nHE IS NOT POTTY TRAINED. His foster is working with him diligently but he is only 9 weeks old. As expected it will take a bit until he is considered fully potty trained and as such, it ultimately is the responsibility of an adopter to potty train if they choose to adopt a PUPPY.\n\n*Animal is AVAILABLE. TO APPLY FOR ADOPTION OR IF YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THAT ARE NOT ADDRESSED IN THIS PROFILE, visit our website mutthutrescues.org Click on 'Adoptables', and click on the animal's Picture to view Full Profile, Additional Information, Pictures and Stats. An application is required in order to apply for the animal and set up a Meet & Greet if your application is chosen. Once we close our application intake period, we review all applications and choose the best one, out of many, to set up a meet. This process is lengthy, and may take a few days or a few weeks.",

Fudge is a Shepherd mix who is actually quite shy around new people. Hes a little over a year old and is still learning the basics as he came to us as a semi-feral pup. Since he was rescued, he has learned to love living indoors! Although he is timid and will need time to warm up to his adoptive family, once he does, hell trust and love you furever for welcoming him home! Fudge would thoroughly enjoy a home where he can be with other doggos! Please only apply if you have a secured fence for this cutie patootie, hes currently learning the ways of the leash.\n\nThe adoption fee for this handsome man is $225. He has been neutered, microchipped and is up to date on vaccines!\n\nWant to meet Fudge? Submit an adoption application and someone will be in touch to schedule a meet n greet to see if hes the right match for you!",

She s snuggling, kisses, walks, and following her humans around the house wherever they go. Zuzu is truly a gentle soul - Just look into her big beautiful brown eyes and pet her velvety soft smooshy face and youll see!\nShe has some limitations with her hips and hind legs, so a home with carpeted stairs (or none at all) is a must. She can handle the few steps off the porch into the yard at her foster home. Shes good with other dogs and loves a good game of tug of war with her foster brother, but shes on the calmer side, not interested in running around much. She ADORES children. No cats.\nZuzu is heartworm positive, therefore she would be placed in a foster-to-adopt situation within reasonable driving distance to the hospital in S Jersey where she will receive treatment beginning next month.\nDuring her treatment, she could begin her furever as your velvety angel!",

Chase is in a foster home with kids and is head over heels for them, Chase has loved everybody he has met, he is working on leash and house training and is doing great! He loves other dogs, unsure of cats, but given his sweet demeanor and young age he very much can be introduced to one. This pup loves toys and zoomies in the backyard but also enjoys a good nap with his people. He will make an amazing family member and make you smile non stop.  If you are interested in meeting this adorable low rider that would be a great candidate for a DNA test...please apply at yvpr,org/adoptions\n\nAn application must be filled out and accepted before a meet can be set up. If accepted, you will hear from us within 72 hours. You will have the opportunity to ask questions before you meet the pet; an adoption may or may not happen at that time. We do adopt outside the Yakima area IF you are able to come to Yakima to pick up your adopted pet.  We do not have a kennel facility; all of our pets are in foster homes. Therefore, meets and adoptions take place at either our office or at a place chosen by the foster.   If a pet has 'pending' beside its name, an adoption is imminent. Please fill out an application anyway because adoptions don't always go through. Your application will be kept on file for 30 days in case you find another pet you'd like to apply for.  Thanks for thinking adoption and Good Luck!",

WE are a high intake No Kill Shelter ran by a staff of 4 and do not always have time to answer every question asked by so many. If you are a good fit for the animal you are interested in -we will call to speak with you, If we feel you are not a good fit , we will contact you about other pets that may be a good fit for your home. Many people are losing the opportunity to adopt the animal they want because they fail to put in an application and the pet was adopted before we could answer your email. .If you have applied for an animal in our facility and have not received a response within 7 days, PLEASE call or contact us again. Though we do our best in trying to answer all emails in a timely manner, sometimes things get away from us, get lost or misplaced. It is never our intention to ignore a request about an adoptable animal in our facility.\n\nSandy Brown, Director, PAW Animal Shelter\n\n319-372-2274",

Although found as a stray, and not clear if he had ever lived in a home, worn a collar or walked on a leash, he is now calmly walking on a leash, taking treats like a gentleman and happily living indoors. Harken\u2019s best friend in the world is a tiny, 4 pound chihuahua :) He loves to play with his little pal and is so gentle! He is playfully curious with cats, but leaves them alone for the most part. He\u2019ll need proper introductions, time and space to warm up to big dogs in the home and has done well meeting new people and children. Older kids, who are steady on their feet, will be a good fit for this guy. Harken loves to sleep belly-up in tight spaces and will make sure you have proper \u201chelp\u201d in the bathroom :) Harken is looking for a Pyr-experienced family, as he can be quite the Houdini at times. He is showing some mild, early signs of hip dysplasia in one hip, so his new family should be committed to keeping him at a healthy weight. Harken loves leisurely walks, without any big obstacles, and loves getting attention from his humans. He will give you the famous Pyr Paw to indicate he wants more pets or scratches. Harken is a wonderful boy, who\u2019s come so far and still has so much potential - if he sounds like the Pyrfect boy for your family, apply for him today!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nNGPR dogs are in foster homes throughout the U.S., NOT Beacon, NY. View full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.\n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

He was put into foster care where he was fattened up, crate trained and house broken. Cats are a curiosity to him and he loves other dogs. The foster reported that he did not tear up bedding or toys and has no kennel anxiety. He loves to play and loves his training treats. Clarke is heartworm negative, neutered, chipped and up to date on shots including his one year rabies.\n\nIf interested in filling out an application for Clarke, please go to our website www.rdrne.org. While there please go to the Adoption Process tab where you can read up on what to expect once we have received your application.",

The momma dog made a nest inside of the insulation underneath the woman\u2019s home, and the lady wanted them out. \n\nWhile we were getting the puppies to safety, the momma dog ran away. After searching for the momma dog for 2 hours in the cold rain, we came up empty. \n\nWithout the momma dog around, we, ourselves, have had to become the \u201cmom\u201d!! This means buying puppy milk replacement, cleaning, bathing, and bottle feeding all 8 puppies!!\n\nPaco is now old enough to find her forever home!! Paco is great with other dogs, loves all people, and loves to receive cuddles and attention anytime and anywhere!!\n\nPlease consider Paco when you are looking for your next family member and companion!",

            "description": "*NOTE* Applications for Ripley are now closed. Thank you to all who applied! \n\nWe will reply to all applicants, but we ask for your patience as we review the applications.  \n\n\n** TORONTO AREA ADOPTERS ONLY**\n\nMeet Ripley:\nRipley is a beautiful shepherd mix puppy new to our rescue. She came to us from Northern Manitoba. We don\u2019t know her birthday but the vet feels she is about four months old. She weighs 27 pounds.\n\nRipley is a very sweet puppy with a lot of potential. At this time, she is extremely fearful of humans. It is evident that she did not have exposure to humans before her rescue.\nShe is slowly adapting to her foster home but will need an experienced adopter who is patient and understanding of fearful dogs. Her foster mom tells us that Ripley is very well behaved despite her young age. Ripley sleeps through the night and is making good progress with her housetraining.\nHer foster parents provide lots of positive training and Ripley is becoming more confident. She requires an adopter who will take the time to gain Ripley\u2019s trust and continue with positive, reward based training.\n\nWe feel she is best suited to a quiet, calm adult home (children 12 years +). \nDue to her fearfulness we consider Ripley a high flight risk.\nFor that reason, she must always be walked on leash and we recommend an adopter in a house with a safely fenced back yard. Adopters will have to follow our special safety guidelines.\n\nRipley gets along well with the other dogs in her foster home and loves to play.\n\nShe is an active puppy and requires plenty of daily exercise.\n\nRipley is in good health. She has had deworming but is still being treated for parasites. Her adopter will need to followup on this. She had her first puppy vaccination and will require her second and third booster. Since she is not fully vaccinated Ripley can not be around a lot of dogs. It is not safe for her to be at a dog park yet. She is microchipped. \n\nPlease see our website for more information on our adoption program and adoption application. (www.adoptadogsavealife.com)\nShe is in a foster home in Toronto. Our adoption process includes an online application, a telephone interview, a virtual home visit and a meeting with the dog. Her adoption fee is $450 and we require a $200 spay deposit.",

Sandy is a 12.5 year old Yellow Lab that was surrendered to Grey Face for medical reasons. Sandy is almost ready to be adopted, but is just waiting on a dental extraction and a mass removal, scheduled for late February, which is why Sandy is labeled as \"Foster to Adopt.\" Overall, Sandy is a pretty typical senior Lab. Sandy loves eating, sleeping, and going for walks. She especially loves her humans, following them around and waiting for snuggles. Her foster paw-rents describe her as the \"perfect dog.\"\n\nAge: 12.5 years old\n\nBreed:\nYellow Labrador\n\nWeight:\n65lbs\n\nKid-friendly:\nPotentially kid friendly, but has never lived with children. Likely, older-considerate children would be OK.\n\nDogs:\nHas lived with other dogs, does well with them. Mostly ignores other dogs on walks.\n\nCats:\nHas lived with cats. Mostly ignores them.\n\nCrate trained:\nNot using crates in foster home.\n\nPotty trained:\nYes\n\nLikes:\nHumans, car rides, treats, large balls, stuffed toys, sleeping, eating, and playing\n\nHealth concerns:\nScheduled for a tooth extraction, and needs special food for Kidney Disease\n\nAdoption fee:\n$275\n\nOur dogs receive heartworm and flea/tick prevention the first week of each month, March through November. Dogs that have stage 3 or 4 dental disease will receive a dental procedure in rescue. We aspirate all lumps and remove those that our veterinary partners suggest removing.\n\nAdopters will be responsible for continued preventatives, follow-up appointments, and medications (if applicable).\n\n$50 discount for seniors (65+) and veterans. Adoption fees help pay for the dog's veterinary exam, vaccinations (rabies, distemper, and bordetella), HW test, blood panel, a microchip, and spay/neuter if needed and additional health needs specific to each animal.\n\nYou can apply to adopt at www.greyfacerescue.org/adoption-application",

Please read our Frequently Asked Questions and Adoption Processed Explained documentation.\n_________ B I O ______________\n\nName:Evie\nSize: ~Medium range: 26-60 lbs\nAdoption Donation:$250 (applicable sales tax included).Adoption fees may be paid by cash or check.\nOther:Spayed Female, Vaccinations current, Microchip\n\nEviejust wants your luv!\n\nFoster Home Feedback\n\n1/29/21: Evie does best in a home with another playful dog, otherwise she has shown to be destructive. She doesn't like her kennel and is left out with my large dogs and does well. Evie loves to play with my Boxer mix. Without some sort of exercise and stimulation, she gets destructive. She likes to be super bossy to my Boxer mix and he lets her, so a more laid back doggie friend would be best. She will steal his toys and he lets her. My large Pit doesn't like her sassiness and had a tiff with her, but she had some pent up energy that she needed to get out. Everyone is good and is happy again. All the dogs sleep with us in our bedroom with no problems. Overall, Evie is a sweet dog and loves to snuggle with her people and other dogs.\n\n1/6/21: Evie is tiny. She looks like a cross between a Boston Terrier and a\npocket Pittie. I forgot to tell you she got a bath and did wonderfully.\nShe didn't like it but sat nicely and waited to be done. She took just a few days to learn our routine and hasn't had any accidents in days. She does bark at noises and now barks in her kennel so it takes some time for her to settle, but she is getting the hang of it. She just wants to be with me and my dogs. She follows me everywhere. Evie has not gotten into anything she shouldn't.\n\nShe chews on bones or toys that are readily available. She tries to steal toys from my other dogs. She has some sass and will snark at my other pups, which my dogs just look at her like she is crazy. She is learning to not do\nthat and is following my direction well. Evie is so smart and listens\nwell. She does snore once she really relaxes, not loud but preciously content.\n\nOverall, Evie is a pretty easy foster. She doesn't jump on me and gets fed well with others. She does take treats a little rough but does well around other dogs doing it. She does well at feeding time, I fed her separately at first but now she just hangs out and waits for her dinner with the other dogs. She knows to sit to be fed. Oh, and Evie is an expert snuggler. She slept with us last night and she slept snuggled in all night long.\n\n1/3/21: This little pocket Pittie is the cutest. Evie follows me around and gets along with my three dogs (Chihuahua, Pit, and Boxer) and the cat. She slept in her kennel without a peep. This is her first day so more to come as we learn more about her.To view additional dogs available for adoption, please see our website: www.4luvofdog.org",

She is a 15 pound terrier mix who was was rescued from Mexico and is now spayed, microchipped, vaccinated, and looking for her forever family. She gets along with other dogs but is a dominant female so would do best with a submissive male  as her partner in crime. Darla is still learning basic commands and leash walking. She is doing very well with potty training and loves to be with her person whether it\u2019s snuggling on the couch or going on a walk.\n\nWe suggest a home with children over the age of 10 for this dog. This dog cannot be adopted out of state. Please see our home page for a list of our Saturday adoption sites. Every potential adopter is required to fill out an adoption application and the dog is placed in the home that would be most suitable for the dog. We do not place our dogs in homes with unfenced swimming pools. Generally we don't release the dogs at the adoption site that day except on occasion to former adopters. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please email FCIAadoptions@aol.com or call 619-466-9137. Due to the pandemic we are now requiring all interested people to fill out our application at www.FCIAnimals.org. If we think it is a good match, we will arrange an introduction.",

I've got a purple dot because I don't care to share my tasty treats, and I'm not very friendly with other animals. I would be best suited to an experienced dog owner with no children at home because I need a lot of training and exercise! Don't let my age deceive you; in typical border collie fashion, I don't show any signs of slowing down. I'm definitely a very people-oriented dog, so if you have experience training dogs in the past, I think you and I will have lots of fun! If you understand my breed and you think we would be a good match, please pay me a visit soon.\n\nWhat's HW+? I'm currently being treated for heartworms. I'll need to keep a calm lifestyle until finished and may require an appointment or two. Please don't be deterred, my lifespan isn't shortened, and I'm not contagious to your other pets.\n\nTake me on a Slumber Party! You can bring me home for a 3 day - 30 day trial period. HSSC will provide food, medications, and necessities. If I'm not the one for you, just bring me back to HSSC and provide feedback on what would be the best home for me.",

            "description": "If you're looking for a dog who likes to go, go, go, look no further. Prince loves to run as fast as he can in the yard, stopping every once in a while to make sure you're still watching him. He gets super excited to go on walks and pulls a little, but luckily he's small enough that he doesn't make much headway. He'll definitely benefit from continued work on his leash manners. Prince will do best in a home where he can get a daily walk and play time. Once he's worn out, Prince is a sweet little lap dog. He climbs right onto you and does that cute dog thing where he turns a couple circles before finally settling in. He loves to unwind with a gentle back scratch and some ear rubs. Prince is looking for a quiet, adult only home, with few visitors. He may do best as the only dog, but if you do have another dog in the home, Prince will want to meet him to be sure it is a good fit. This prince also wants a castle, so no apartment life for him. Come meet this little ham! Prince is a Diamond Dogs and will be shown by appointment only. Diamond Dogs are dogs that are currently receiving special training from staff and volunteers through our behavior modification program. If you are interested in learning more about this animal, please fill out an application by clicking here . Be sure to include Prince A1333782 when filling out the survey. After reviewing your application, we will only be reaching out to you if the animal is a good fit for your home.",

            "description": "Hi, Im Sparkles! Im a 4 month old Lab Chihuahua mix, and Im 7 pounds right now. Im very playful and sweet, and give the best snuggles. I am working really hard to learn as much as I can, before going to my forever home. Potty training is a work in progress, but I know if youre patient with me, Ill get it figured out really soon! I sleep in my crate at night, but I dont always like it... Im really good with kids, and love to play with the big dog in my foster home. Im still learning what is and isnt for me to chew on, but Im sure you will help me with that too! I would love more than anything, to come be a part of your family, if you would let me! Sparkles' adoption fee is $400 which covers her spay, vaccinations appropriate at the time of adoption, microchip and any additional medical care she may have needed while in the rescues care. We are a foster based rescue, we do not house dogs at a facility. Age and breed, are NLR's best guess as we often don't know who or what mom and dad are. If you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application on our website www.northernlakesrescue.org",

            "description": "Hannah is quite the sweetie.   This  6 or 7  year old female had a tough start. For her first 6 years (or so) she was a breeder dog for a puppy mill in Lancaster County.  When she no longer was breeding full and viable litters she was one of the lucky dogs we were able to pull into our rescue. \nHannah is much enjoying her retirement in her foster home near Philadelphia. She is not terribly active but she loves walks . She likes to watch TV on the sofa and just be with her people. \nShe likes to play with the other dogs in the house and she is appropriate when meeting and interacting with other dogs.  With cats she will chase but she doesn't seem to be aggressive about it. \nHannah gets nervous in crowds of people and can be  leery of some people but overall she is friendly with most adults. She can be picked up and handled ,  Her toe nails can be cut  and her teeth safely checked.  The only thing Hannah doesn't like is children. which could be lack of exposure but more probably past history when she was a breeding dog. \nAs Hannah's foster , I can assure you she will be a dear companion for someone just looking for a buddy.  She's  healthy and doesn't need alot of attention.  She is content just to be loved\nMAJR is a small foster based rescue . All of our dogs live with foster families. We do not have a kennel where you can meet the dogs. Hannah is currently in  the Philadelphia  suburbs . If you are interested in adopting Hannah please fill out an adoption application on our website MAJR.org",

Chewing on bones or stuffed toys is some of her favorite things to do . She likes to chew. She loves to eat and gets very excited when it\u2019s time, but she\u2019s a bit slower eater than her sister. \u00a0Once Winnie has her energy out, she is completely mellow and will plop down pretty much anywhere to take a nap. She is happy being picked up and snuggled as well. She\u2019s learning to go to the bathroom outside and on the potty pads. \u00a0She\u2019s a bit more of a go with the flow puppy and would be a wonderful addition to any home!\nIf you would like to meet Winnie, please visit spotslaststop.org and fill out her application.\n",

Honey enjoys going for walks, and walks nicely on a leash.  She is a smart girl who knows a few commands including: come, sit, and paw, and she also take treats gently.  Honey would do best in a home with children over the age of 7, as younger children may be too much for her.  Honey has lived with another dog before, and might warm up to a companion when given some time to adjust, however she seems to prefer a home without cats.  \n\n11 years old \n\n**This dog is at the Ocean County Animal Facility North located at 615 Fremont Ave, Jackson NJ (off of Hope Chapel Rd).  All dogs are spayed/neutered, micro-chipped, and have age appropriate shots.**\n\n****DUE TO COVID WE ARE CURRENTLY ONLY OPEN BY APPOINTMENT ONLY, YOU MUST CALL TO SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT, 732-657-8086.****\n\nTo adopt our dogs you must come to the facility with your entire family, including dogs, to meet with our staff and the dog you are interested in.",

She is extremely intelligent!  She has done very well with training basics such as \"sit\", \"come\", \"stay\", and \"lie down\" and picked all of it up in record time.  Robbie is a very sweet dog, however, she prefers playtime more than anything!  She is very much a herder and loves to run around in circles whether it be to chase her own tail or a toy.  She loves toys of all shapes and sizes.  She is very good with other dogs and we believe that she craves the companionship of them.  She would most likely do best in a home with another dog (or more) to run around with, play with, and bond with.  She is a very friendly girl and soaks up attention like a sponge!  Robbie will need either an active family or one with a large fenced in area for her to run around and let her energy out.  She will need a family that understands the amount of stimulation that she will need to keep her happy and healthy.  Basically, someone that has the time to run and play with her.  Meet and greets at our shelter are currently by appointment only.  If you are interested in meeting Robbie, please call us at the shelter at (828) 488-0418.",

He is a bundle of energy and will do best with a family that is active and ready for lots of walks and playtime. Cashew's ideal home will be with older teens and adults only that are able to handle a high energy fellow like himself. He seems to like other dogs and will just need to meet any potential dog friends prior to the adoption to ensure everyone is getting along. Cashew loves treats and learns very quickly so with some time and treats you can definitely teach this boy some new tricks. If you think you are ready to meet this handsome guy just apply for adoption today to get an appointment to stop in.",

            "description": "Meet Hotdog! His New Year's resolution is to make 2021 the year of health and fitness. Hotdog came to us with a few extra pounds that he's looking to shed. He would love a semi-active owner that is consistent with his fitness regimen so he can drop some pounds and live a happier healthier life. Don't let his size fool you, this boy can be very playful (and we expect his personality and activity level to shine brighter once he loses some weight). He loves to flop in front of anyone that will let him to get some belly rubs. This happy-go-lucky guy will do just about anything for a treat, and loves toys, but doesn't always like to share his items. If he goes to a home with children, they should be older, mature children that respect his boundaries. Hotdog is excited to be the only animal in the home, so he doesn't have to share his people either! If you have room in your home and heart for this silly boy, come in and meet Hotdog today!",

I can be quite active and love playing fetch--most of the time I will even bring the ball back to you to throw again. I am not bothered by cats or other dogs. I do however get jealous if there is another doggie who is getting attention and I am not, or if there are people who could be petting me and are not (I will let you know by whining a bit but will eventually quiet down). \n\nI enjoy car rides and looking out the window. I am an absolute sucker for some pets and scratches and take treats nicely. I do need some work with leash training, but I have no problem being on a leash--harnesses work best with me as I tend to pull. I have been told that I am a very smart girl who learns fast. I have not been tested around children, but I would likely do fine with older kids. If you are looking for a sweet, fun pup to be a new member of your family, then look no further!",

While he doesn't enjoy the crate quite yet, he is good about going into it, especially when given treats or a meal in it. Cruiser has had no accidents in the house or his crate. At first, Cruiser was scared of the garage door noise, as well as the stairs. However, he quickly figured out that the garage door wasn't a monster and that stairs are fun! (He gets a good amount of exercise now running up and down the stairs multiple times a day.) His foster mom is also teaching him \"off and \"go back, so he understands boundaries and where he can and can't be in the house. Cruiser has gone on several adventures with his foster mom, including the pet store. He was an excellent passenger; he just laid down on the floor and never barked. He was interested in being a co-pilot whenever the car stopped, however. Cruiser has been excited to meet some dogs, and less excited about others. Cruiser's favorite toy is a nylabone. If you are interested in meeting this sweet boy, please submit an appointment request here: \n\nhttps://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=lsJ_8Hpq8k2OaDbCdJiGnZ0KUdNlMOxGs9o3MWhive1UOFRNUUhQMlFUSlM4UU04RUdEQ1dQNUFWTC4u\n\nCurrent weight: 52 pounds\nCurrent age: 1 year old",

My adoption fee is $99\nIn response to the social distancing recommendations from the CDC and WHO, the Roanoke Valley SPCA is modifying our adoption procedures. With these new restrictions, we do our best to be as fair as possible. Pets are adopted on a first come basis. Our challenge is to find homes for the pets in our care as quickly as possible so we can help other pets in need. With the increase in cases in Southwest Virginia, adoption hours are Thursday-Saturday between Noon and 7 pm. Unfortunately, we are unable to hold pets nor guarantee a pet will be available at the time of your appointment, but we do promise to call you if a pet is adopted prior to your appointment.\nIf you are interested in adopting me, please compete our online Adoption Application. Please book your appointment to meet me. Our adoption staff will give you a call to confirm the appointment and answer any questions you may have prior to the meet and greet.\nCall 540-339-9247 Monday - Saturday between Noon and 7 pm to speak with an adoption counselor for more information",

            "description": "Steve is absolutely adorable. He loves to let his opinions be known. He is very friendly with people. He enjoys affection and likes to be with people. I don't think he's housebroken and I'm not sure he's ever been inside before. He was abandoned with his brother in a yard when the owners moved out. They didn't have a dog house, just a plastic crate for shelter. They both have some food aggression issues, possibly because food was scarce and they learned to guard it from each other. Both of these little boys will become amazing pets in no time. They are thrilled with the changes in their lives so far, and once they get to be inside a home they'll be even more thrilled. They can not be placed together (they have some issues with each other) but they are ok with other dogs for the most part. They are bossy, they want to be in charge with other dogs...but other than that they are ok. At Autumn Acres Animal Rescue we believe each individual animal matters. We take in special cases some of which will stay with us as a sanctuary dog.If the animal is listed as a Socially Imperfect Dog this means they have special needs and special requirements for potential adopters.If the animal is listed as a Socially Imperfect RESIDENT this animal is NOT available for adoption and is one of our sanctuary residents. We list them on our sites because they still matter and they still need donations to help with their long term care.Check out our website for more information: http://www.autumnacres.org",

            "description": "Martin is quite an accomplished fence climber! No chain link fences for him. While he's not very big, he'll scale a 6' chain link fence with ease and try to jump over a 4' fence. He's not doing this to run off...he tries to follow us! This boy can't wait to be a house dog. He's a sweetheart with people but he can be quite bossy with other dogs (especially with his brother!). He was abandoned with his brother in a yard when the owners moved out. They didn't have a dog house, just a plastic crate for shelter. They both have some food aggression issues, possibly because food was scarce and they learned to guard it from each other. Both of these little boys will become amazing pets in no time. They are thrilled with the changes in their lives so far, and once they get to be inside a home they'll be even more thrilled. They can not be placed together (they have some issues with each other) but they are ok with other dogs for the most part. They are bossy, they want to be in charge with other dogs...but other than that they are ok. At Autumn Acres Animal Rescue we believe each individual animal matters. We take in special cases some of which will stay with us as a sanctuary dog.If the animal is listed as a Socially Imperfect Dog this means they have special needs and special requirements for potential adopters.If the animal is listed as a Socially Imperfect RESIDENT this animal is NOT available for adoption and is one of our sanctuary residents. We list them on our sites because they still matter and they still need donations to help with their long term care.Check out our website for more information: http://www.autumnacres.org",

Months of casts and limited activity allowed him to heal beautifully, but for a young, energetic dog, it was a tough start to life. As a result, he has not been socialized the way we would like, and has months of pent up energy to work off. \n\nThis dog is the full package, but he really needs an owner that is very experienced with the GSD breed. They are strong willed, extremely smart and stubborn as mules. They are also devoted, loving dogs that are the best of companions in the right home.\n\nWe don't know how Dexter will be with other dogs, children or cats. He will definitely need a large securely fenced yard. Experience with working breed dogs is strongly preferred.\n\n\nOur dogs are fed a nutrient rich dog food named NutriSource.  Our experience is a high quality dog food keeps vet bills down and well-being high.\n\nIf you have any questions please email: claudiaatwag@gmail.com\n\nVisit our website to fill out an Adoption Application  http://www.wagsequimwa.com\n\nAdoption donation fee $350  (Please understand this adoption donation goes towards helping all the dogs we rescue)",

He is huge, beautiful, loving, smart and strong!\n\nMarky came to us when his owner was no longer able to care for him. He has settled in well and is full of joy and playfulness. Because he cannot see at all, he is easily frighten and is only now confident enough to take short walks on a leash without being terrified. He does great in our play yards once he gets a sense of them.\n\nBecause of his size and high fear response, we feel he needs to be in a home without young children. He might enjoy a calm doggy friend, but no small or high energy dogs. Cats are a definite no as are stairs in the home.\n\nMarky must have a securely fenced yard to run and play in. Leash walking might always be difficult for him, so having a safe place to just be a young happy dog is crucial.\n\nThis is a special dog, that deserves a special home. Maybe yours?\n\nOur dogs are fed a nutrient rich dog food named NutriSource.  Our experience is a high quality dog food keeps vet bills down and well-being high.\n\nIf you have any questions please email: claudiaatwag@gmail.com\n\nVisit our website to fill out an Adoption Application  http://www.wagsequimwa.com\n\nAdoption donation fee $350  (Please understand this adoption donation goes towards helping all the dogs we rescue)",

We took her to the vet and she was Heartworm positive so we got her treatment and she is now microfilaria negative so she can travel to her forever home! \n\nLizzie is estimated to be around 3 years old. She does well with other pups and loves to run and play! We are suggesting no young children because she is quite energetic and doesn\u2019t know her own size so she may accidentally knock over a little one. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adopting Lizzie, please visit our website, www.safewithusanimalrescue.org to fill out an application!",

It was me, my mom Oreo, & my 12 other siblings. We were all \"Cookie\" puppies at the time, but I've had this name for a lot longer now. There were a couple of us that didn't make it due to parvo, but most of us made it through alive & well! That was a long time ago, though. Since then I've been in my new home, but for a while now I've had issues with other animals, mostly dogs. We've lived together before, but every once in a while I'll just decide to pick a fight out of nowhere, so it's not a 100% all the time sort of thing, but probably best if I just didn't go to a home with other animals to avoid any issues. Otherwise, I'm great with people! I'm super high energy, I love to run, & play fetch, & just anything that gets me up, out, & moving! I may have my problems, just like any shelter dog, but I promise I'll make a great companion for you or your family if you're willing to give me a chance!\n\nI've been spayed, but I'll need to get an updated rabies shot before I can leave. If you're looking for a rough & rowdy girl that can play with you all day, come check me out sometime!",

He had evident signs of severe skin allergies. After an extensive allergy test we have him on the road to recovery with a basic medication regimen. The Union County Humane Society is willing to provide the needed medication and follow up care with veterinary staff. Dash has been here two hundred and thirty-eight days! He loves to take walks at our local park. When he isn\u2019t showering you with kisses, you will find him snuggled up with his blanket and toys. If you\u2019re working from home and looking for a loyal companion, Dash is just what you need. Visit our website at uchspets.org and fill out an application today!\n",

MPM Rescue reviews application and checks vet records and references;\n4.  MPM foster contacts approved applicant(s) to arrange a home check and meeting with available dog(s);\n5.   If there is a good fit, adoption is completed with a contract and fees (payable via check or cash).\n\nThe adoption fee is listed here: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n\nDogs from Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue come with the following medical care already provided:\n- Spay/Neuter surgery\n- Age appropriate vaccinations\n- Heartworm test (for dogs over 6mo) and treatment if positive\n- Microchip\n- Deworming\n- Heartworm and Flea/Tick Preventative\n- Any other necessary medical treatment as recommended by veterinarian\n\n*Please note that the identified breed(s) are best guesses.

Weimaraners typically have a high prey drive, so smaller pets may not be a good fit; however, Izzy may do well with another larger, calm dog.  Unknown with children, but perhaps gentle, dog-savvy youngsters might work.  Izzy will come to a new home with toys and her favorite dog bed.\n\nLiving with someone who is home most of the time would probably be best for Izzy.  She is afraid of small dark places such as a closed bathroom or closet and did not do well with a crate.  Izzy had a bit of a rough puppyhood; but she is young and so ready to learn and love!!

One thing about Shrimp is, she is always down for a nice romp sesh with her canine friends and sure can hold her own!\n\nYou must be over 21 and a home owner to adopt me.

I'm a Boxer mix, 5 years old, 70 lbs, & I have a tan/black/white coloring.\n\nI'm a spunky & lively guy who I know for a fact you'll fall in love with the moment you meet me! I've just got that sort of vibe to me, ya know? The type of thing that makes everyone around me just a bit more chill & happy, & always puts a smile on their face! I might have some grey on my face now, but don't let that fool you! I've still got plenty of juice left in me! I love to get outside, run around, & I'm ALWAYS up for some fetch! I haven't had a ton of socialization with kids or other animals, & while I've never had an issue with adults at all at least, I don't really get along with other animals that well. Or, like, at all to be honest. Especially when it comes to there being food around! I'll definitely need to be in a one-animal home, but it'd probably be best if it were a home with all adults as well. I've always been sort of an indoor/outdoor dog who was able to come & go from home, so who knows what I might've done out there! Well, of course, I know what I've done, but that's my own little secret! Being I've been a partial outdoor dog, you'll definitely need to keep me on leash for a good while when you bring me home. I might have the tendency to wander off, maybe jump a fence or somethin. Who knows!? I might end up getting into a little trouble here & there, but if you're able to teach me to stick around better & give me a loving new home, I promise I'll be a great dog for you for years to come!\n\nI'm up to date on shots, neutered, chipped, & ready to go! I also tested negative for heartworm. If you're looking for a handsome guy who's got the charm to back it up, I'm the dog for you!",

Since we don't have a long health history of your\nadopted dog, we can only treat the pet for whatever symptoms present during the initial exam\nand follow up exams.~\n\nHealth: ***** This poor guy had to have a hernia removed, his dewclaws removed because they hung out too far and he had a cryptoid neutering. No other obvious issues found during vet exam ****\n\nTemperament / Personality: He's a sweet boy but super picky about his people. He really doesn't care for men so far. He is great with other dogs and of course most women. Would make an excellent lap dog or even a walking partner. --\n\nWhere did he come from: Surrendered to our rescue cause he was biting the other family members.\n\nAdoption: ***** $433.00 Includes Required Tax *****\nWeight: 10.6 lbs.\nDOB: 3/12/2013\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION: http://www.recycledpoms.org/application --\n\nEmail info@recycledpomeranians.com to request a printable application. --\n\n------Please remember our group is made of only volunteers all of whom have full time jobs, foster fur-kids, and families of their own, so please be patient.--------",

This adorable and friendly fellow is a 5-to-6-year-old, 13 pound Chihuahua / Dachshund mix who is a champion snuggler. Rico likes to cuddle, and his foster mom says he prefers the lifestyle of a lap dog. Rico will give you sweet canine kisses if you promise to trade for some belly rubs. He does great with other dogs and also cats. Rico likes to go for walks, and also enjoys quiet time too, just as long as he is with you! His favorite spot is curled up under the covers in bed. Rico is crate trained and doing well with housetraining as long as he gets frequent outings and uses a belly band in the house. Rico has heartworms and is on the mend from treatment for those; he needs a calm and relaxing home to complete his recovery. If you feel you can help this precious pooch find the life he deserves, apply to adopt!\n\nInterested in adopting? Take the first step and complete an adoption application on our website: http://aarf-tn.com/adopt/adoption-apps/\n\nIf you have questions that are not covered in the profile, visit the Pet Inquiry Form: http://aarf-tn.com/contact/pet-inquiry-form/.\n\nTHIS PET IS FOSTERED IN TENNESSEE! We do list and adopt our pets nationwide. Typical transport cost to the Northeast is $160. Due to interstate adoption regulations, we are not able to adopt to RI and MA state residents.\n\nA.A.R.F. (All About Rescue and Fixin' Inc.) http://aarf-tn.com/ is a non-profit, 501(c)(3) no kill animal rescue organization located in the Upper Cumberland area of Tennessee. A.A.R.F. is comprised of unpaid volunteers and survives only on public donations. Thank you for thinking adoption first!\n\nPrior to adoption, all canines and felines are spayed or neutered, have received their age appropriate vaccinations, have been de-wormed for common parasites, and have received treatment for prevention of fleas and ticks. All canines over the age of 6 months have been tested for heartworm. All canines are put on heartworm prevention as soon as possible - this means dogs as soon as they are tested negative. Puppies are put on prevention immediately. All felines, regardless of age, have been tested for Feline Leukemia/FIV. Each animal receives a health check by a licensed veterinarian prior to adoption.

            "description": "Marley is a purebred Yorkshire terrier. She is a senior at approx 13 1/2 years old (previous vet records have her DOB at 7/25/2007). Marley was surrendered by her owner because she could no longer afford to care for her and she had to move to an apartment. Her owner stated that Marley would sometimes have toileting accidents and that she could not keep her in the apartment if she continued. She also did not want to keep her crated all day either, as that is no life for a dog. Marley is blind and is missing most of her teeth but is in otherwise good health according to the vet. She saw the vet on January 27th, 2021 to get her annual vetting updated. Marley is negative for heartworms and was parasite free from the sample that was collected. She was found to have one small lump near her rear but it was a squishy lump so vet was not concerned that it was anything serious. We completed bloodwork on her as well, due to her age, and everything was normal. Overall, this girl is in good shape and just needs a retirement home where she can spend the rest of her life. Marley enjoys a nice, soft, cozy bed and is a very laid back girl. She gets around quite well even though she cant see. Marley does great with other dogs and has not minded older children. We would not recommend a home with very young children who may try to grab or snatch at her since she cant see and that could startle her. She should do fine with cats as she really doesn't seem to mind anyone and just takes things in stride. Preferably, a quiet, calm home with an older person or couple would he her ideal forever home. Marley is not overly active and does like to cuddle and sleep a lot so a person who enjoys the same would be perfect for her. Please understand that Marley is an older girl so we do not know how long she may have. We are hopeful that she still has several good years left, given her good health, but the reality of adopting an older dog (especially) is that there are no guarantees. Marley's adoption fee will be $175 to help cover her vetting and cost of daily care while with us. If adopted by a senior, Marley qualifies for our senior for seniors program and her adoption fee is only $100. If interested in giving Marley her forever home,please submit your adoption application and interest via email. You may also TEXT ONLY to 352-215-3260(phone calls will not be returned or answered at this number but is your best option for fastest response), FB message us or call 352-493-1255(leave message if no answer) for more info or to set up a day and time to meet her.",

            "description": "Howdy! I'm Spencer. I was found running around on some property one day with a buddy of mine; the folks that lived in the area didn't really like us being there because we chased some chickens ONE TIME! If you ask me, those chickens had it coming. Anyway, one of the families decided that they'd give ARFhouse a call to see if they had space for two more cuties and luckily for us, they did! \n\nI am the sweetest young Border Collie/Lab mix; approximately 2 years old and I weigh 55 lbs. I have a playful and loving personality; I get along with all dogs and I LOVE humans! I can jump a 6ft. chainlink fence, so I will need a privacy fence at least 6ft. high. I love to run, jump and play with toys; I will make the most wonderful addition to any family. I walk well on a leash, am gentle in nature and I am one of the smartest dogs you'll ever meet. I could use some fine-tuning on my training but I'm sharp as a tack and will pick it up so quickly. \n\nThe fee to adopt Spencer is $200.00; this includes spay/neuter, deworming, vaccinations and a microchip. If you are interested in adopting Spencer, please visit our website. www.arfhouse.org and fill out an adoption application. \n\n**Please Note: Spencer is currently located at our facility in Sherman, Texas. Adoptions are by-appointment only; if you would like to meet Spencer, please fill out an application on our website. Once we have your application, our Adoption Coordinator will follow up with you ASAP with any questions she may have, or to set up a meet-and-greet.",

MUST HAVE STRUCTURALLY FENCED IN YARDS, ABSOLUTELY NO EXCEPTIONS**\n\nChardonnay and her two brothers came to The Animal Care Society when their owners could no longer afford to care for them. We aren't sure what breed they are but we do know that they came from a house with several unaltered small breed dogs, so they should stay small as well. They need a patient owner who is ready to work on basic training and housebreaking. Puppies take a lot of time and commitment, so keep that in mind if you are interested in adopting one. \nIf you like to meet Chardonnay, please head over to our website www.animalcaresociety.org to fill out an application. Primary Color: Brown Secondary Color: White Age: 0yrs 0mths 10wks I am available for adoption at the Animal Care Society.",

Please visit http://www.caninelifeline.org/adoption-process/ for more information about our adoption process and to submit an online application.\n\nPrince is a wonderful 1-2 year-old Lab/Dobie mix neutered male whose name fits him to a T as he is a perfect gentleman! He came to us from an overcrowded rural county dog shelter so he could take his time finding the perfect new home. While we have no history on Prince, we were impressed with this boy's gentle and kind demeanor from the moment we met him. Prince must have been well cared for at some point in his life as he knows the sit, down, and shake hands commands. He'll eagerly run through his tricks for a yummy treat which he takes very gently. Prince gets along well with other dogs and does enjoy playing chase and wrestling with his fellow foster dogs. He walks quite nicely on a leash for a big guy and will make an excellent walking buddy for his new family. Prince met the resident kitty at the vet clinic with curiosity coupled with shyness so might be fine living with cats in his new home as long as the introductions are done properly. We think that once you meet this great dog you're going to be as smitten with him as we are! Prince weighs about 53 pounds and his adoption fee is $350. He's neutered, heartworm negative and on monthly preventative, up to date on vaccinations including bivalent canine influenza, wormed, on flea and tick preventative, and microchipped. As part of the adoption process, all adopters must commit to a two-week adjustment period to make sure it's a great match before the adoption is finalized. Please email info@caninelifeline.org if you're interested in Prince. An approved application is required before we schedule meets with any of our dogs. Please note that we don't place our dogs in homes with children under 7 years of age. We correspond via email so please check your junkmail or spam folder to make sure our reply hasn't landed in there. Please visit our website at www.caninelifeline.org to see more photos of Prince and to submit an online application if you live in Northeast OH.",

Kiska can jump! She will jump or climb fences if left outside alone. If she is out with people playing she is fine. Adopter will need to stay outside with her, work on training for this and have a run in the meantime so that she is not in danger of getting loose. Kiska was tested with young kids and was gentle - suggest 3 and up. Good with other dogs, good with sharing resources. Positive toy drive and gives up toy gently. Positive food drive and is gentle taking treats. \n\nShe is very friendly and bubbly. While she does have a lot of energy, she will just sit with her person and relax. She loves to play fetch, tug, personal play with her human, and full contact with other dogs. Her playful energy and play style can be a bit much for some dogs. We are working with her on a calm state of mind when she needs to settle. She is a little jumpy so we are also working with her on that. She is getting better at her obedience commands as well. Kiska would benefit from continued training and also would be great at drive sports such as, the wall climb, slat mill, weight pull and spring pole. Those sports would really fulfill her biological needs.\n\nWant to Adopt? 1) Fill out an application on theluckypuppy.org The donation fees are minimum $475 for puppies up to 6 months, minimum $400 for dogs 7 months to 6 years and minimum $ 300 for 7+ years/Special Needs. 2) Once your application is in, our adoption coordinator will contact you and complete a vet check and home visit (possibly electronic). 3) Once approved, please schedule a meet and greet to see the dogs.

And who else is part of the \u201cactual\u201d committee from which this saying comes from? ?????Lol it\u2019s nice to get to know new things about people.\n\nAnyways, this itty bitty thing was brought to the shelter because the owner stated they \u201ccouldn\u2019t handle one more dog.\u201d Unless this was a house packed with little dogs, how did the smallest of the tribe get the boot? \n\nSushi is a 4 year old Chihuahua, completely fun size, rocks a natural fur collar, and does the leave your tongue out while chilling look. He is dog and kid friendly and per typical not yet neutered Chihu-esque fashion, loves to get all up in other dogs\u2019 \u201cbusiness\u201d if they let him. Although he is light as a feather, his drive makes up for his teeny size, his foster said lol. Oh horndogs. Sushi can live in any type of household we believe at this very moment. So far he has shown nothing but all good regular and normal dog things. Still wondering about the original family with too many dogs. Did Sushi father the other dogs?? Are you Montego\u2019s dad??\n\nIf interested in going rogue and trying something much more exciting than the amateur California Roll, apply for Sushi at leadrescue.org!",

Here are a few notes from CJ's behavior assessment:  \n\nKennel Approach - Excitable response to presence -- jumps up and down, barks. Sometimes growls at strangers but stops when door is opened; easily leashed.\nPossession - Shows no interest in toy.\nTouch/Handling - Softens with petting, engages tester -- licks, nuzzles, seeks attention, rolls onto back. Lets handler pick him up.\n Food - Eats out of hand, sits for food, lifts head out of bowl, lets handler take bowl.\n Correction - Easily redirects to handler; compliant. \n- rolls onto back; submissive.\n Tested with male Lab mix: interested/social toward other dog. Dogs mounted each other, rolled around on ground with other dog, play bites. \nOverall Behavior - Relaxed, friendly, easy to handle, playful. No signs of kennel stress.\n\nAdoption fee includes vaccinations, spay/neuter, heartworm test, and microchip.\n*Dogs are pending behavior and other-animal assessment unless otherwise noted here.\n\n\nAvailable for adoption, foster, or rescue at the following location::\n\nJefferson Parish Animal Shelter - Eastbank\n#1 Humane Way, Harahan LA 70123\n504-736-6111\n\nPlease provide ID number when  contacting or visiting the shelter.

            "description": "Calla is the sweetest little doll you will ever meet. She was estimated to be about 3 years old, and she weighs just 35 pounds! Calla came to us pregnant and desperate for medical care. She was and IS a fantastic mother and she will be ready to go to her new home in just a couple of weeks. Calla would do best in a home without other dogs. Not because she doesn\u2019t like other dogs, but because she has been through a lot and deserves 100% of someone\u2019s love and attention. She gets upset when her foster dog siblings get loved on because she wants everything to herself and she deserves it! \n\nCalla also needs a very financially stable family who is able to care for her special needs in case of an emergency. Calla has a rare clotting disorder that makes any surgeries and future injuries very risky. It does not affect callas daily life but in the event that she is ever seriously injured she could bleed too much without the proper medical attention. \n\nThis dog knows she was rescued and she repays her people with lots of love and affection every day. If you want a loyal couch potato companion than calla is your girl. \n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Calla please copy and paste our application link into your browser and complete at:\n\nhttps://daniellethedogrescuer.wufoo.com/forms/zq5l29b022pyq0/\n\nPlease no calls or texts. We will process your application and get back to you.\n\nAdopter must be located within a 30 mile radius of Trinity, Florida 34655",

One dogwalker says, I love this girl! She's on arthritis medication for life (DFL provides 14 days of meds). Maya Garcia would like someone to walk and play with often to help her lose weight (the most effective way to control the arthritis). This lovely, friendly girl is easy to handle and good around other dogs. If you're an affectionate person who likes to stop and smell the roses, you two could be a great pair!",

She is doing beautifully with the children and other dogs in her foster home. Luca is crate-trained and almost fully housebroken. This lovely lady is off to a great start and she\u2019s ready to find her forever family. \n\nLuca is fully vetted -- spayed, microchipped, heartworm negative, and current on vaccinations and deworming.  The adoption fee is $250. We accept payment in the form of cash, CashApp and Zelle. You can apply to adopt by submitting an application at www.sohfga.com.",

When they first arrived to SNIPSA, they were bug-eyed, nervous, tails tucked\u2026unsure of their new world. Never having been around humans before, it was understandable. But after a relaxing spa day of warm baths, nail trims, flea and tick removal, and an introduction to big fluffy dog beds, they are LOVING the pet life. The \u201cK Litter\u201d spends their days learning how fun toys can be, snoozing in the sun, and coming out of their shell. It might take a minute for their true personalities to show when you bring one home but after a few days of some patience, love, and routine, the playful and silly puppy personality will shine through! We expect these shepherd mix pups to be medium to large when fully grown. If you\u2019ve been looking for a pup to raise, consider bringing home Kai, Kylo, Kade, or Kyle!

Both Opi and Mela tend to gravitate to women over men, and couch time snuggles are key to their in home success. Both girls are well mannered in the home and will thrive in an environment with patience; love, and calmness. These girls are petite (hence the mini) so their humans should embrace life with doggie steps to the couch and bed. Opi and Mela are spayed, hw negative, UTD on vaccines, microchipped, and have had dentals. They\u2019re in foster in Broomfield. Adoption fee for the pair is $600. REQUIREMENTS: 1. Fenced yard 2. No kids 3. Calm home with minimal stairs 4. Patient humans willing to continue slow socialization 5. Furniture privileges.

When they first arrived to SNIPSA, they were bug-eyed, nervous, tails tucked\u2026unsure of their new world. Never having been around humans before, it was understandable. But after a relaxing spa day of warm baths, nail trims, flea and tick removal, and an introduction to big fluffy dog beds, they are LOVING the pet life. The \u201cK Litter\u201d spends their days learning how fun toys can be, snoozing in the sun, and coming out of their shell. It might take a minute for their true personalities to show when you bring one home but after a few days of some patience, love, and routine, the playful and silly puppy personality will shine through! We expect these shepherd mix pups to be medium to large when fully grown. If you\u2019ve been looking for a pup to raise, consider bringing home Kai, Kylo, Kade, or Kyle!

But once you sit down he will be in you're lap giving you kisses and begging for scratches behind his ears. Buddy also love's to play in the mud and make cute muddy paw print's.  He rarely barks, his kennel is never a mess and he knows how to \"sit\".\n\nDue to Covid, we now work by appointment only and work on a first come basis.  If you are interested in making an appointment, please call the HCHS at 512-793-5463.  You can see all our available animals at HillCountryHumaneSociety.org.\nAll our adoptable dogs are treated for fleas, given DHPPV and Bordatella vaccines and are de-wormed.  \nWhen you adopt one of our animals it will be micro chipped and registered at the time of adoption.  Also, if not already altered, you will receive a voucher to get your animal spay/neutered.\nWhile we do our best to determine the breeds of our dogs, the majority are strays, and we have only general appearance, coat type, size, ear type, tail, tongue color and coat color to base breed on.  It is always possible when adopting a puppy that it will change dramatically to look like another breed.\n\n",

He loves people, and is looking for an active home that can spend a lot of time with him. \n\nBrad has lived with children aged 7 to 13, and did wonderfully with them. He does NOT do well with other animals, so he should be an ONLY pet. \n\nBrad is house and crate trained. He is a very active and very high energy boy. His new family should be ready to put some work in and get him into training to help him be the best he can be. Brad is a very intelligent dog and will thrive with structure and training. His previous home kept him outside, or crated indoors because he didn't do well with their small dogs. Because of this, he does have some separation anxiety. \n\nBrad is a gorgeous young dog with a lot of potential. He just needs the right home! Please give then shelter a call if you would like to meet this handsome guy. 520-432-6020",

Adorable and sweet with a striking black mask and soulful eyes, she strives to win your attention and affection and enjoys just chilling by your side. She's mid size and mid energy.  She can be a bit shy coming out of her kennel, but she soon gets comfortable and then happily enjoys her walks. Luna meets other dogs very politely on walks and mingles well in her playgroups with all of the other pups, then she returns to be with people. Beauties like her don't last long so you better hurry!\nNO CATS!!\n\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website and Facebook page!

It seems like the more attention you give her the more she craves. She is looking for a Husky loving home who understands that she will need long daily walks or runs and will need a secure fenced yard or supervised while outside. She is not an apartment dogs and will not be happy cooped up all the time and really enjoys her outdoor adventure time with her people! She seems to know the commands sit and down and thoroughly enjoyed her time on the couch in our enrichment room. She seems to be friendly with other dogs and will do best in a home with no cats or small critters running around. Maya is eager and ready to be a big part of your life!\n*If you are interested in adopting Maya please call the shelter (509 662-9577) to set up an appointment to meet her.",

When they first arrived to SNIPSA, they were bug-eyed, nervous, tails tucked\u2026unsure of their new world. Never having been around humans before, it was understandable. But after a relaxing spa day of warm baths, nail trims, flea and tick removal, and an introduction to big fluffy dog beds, they are LOVING the pet life. The \u201cK Litter\u201d spends their days learning how fun toys can be, snoozing in the sun, and coming out of their shell. It might take a minute for their true personalities to show when you bring one home but after a few days of some patience, love, and routine, the playful and silly puppy personality will shine through! We expect these shepherd mix pups to be medium to large when fully grown. If you\u2019ve been looking for a pup to raise, consider bringing home Kai, Kylo, Kade, or Kyle!

            "description": "Hi, my name is Greyson. I am a little 8 week old bundle of boy Chihuahua and possibly terrier. I will probably top out at 20-25 lbs. I have my first shots and am ready to roll.\n\nPuppies require an adopter who is home a good part of the day to continue their training - no exceptions! They are up-to-date on age appropriate vaccines and preventatives and will need to be spayed/neutered at the age of 6 months. Please note, this pup's immune system will not be fully functioning until about 16 weeks of age and therefore, s/he is not suited for Apartment/Condo living or Town homes without a private fenced yard and will not be able to go to public places where s/he could possibly be exposed to the germs of unvaccinated dogs, such as PetSmart/PetCo and dog parks until s/he is 16 weeks old.\n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $375, which helps with the cost of routine vet care. This fee DOES NOT INCLUDE spay/neuter if the pup is not already spayed/neutered. If the animal you are adopting is not already spayed/neutered, you will be required to sign a contract legally obligating you to have the animal altered. ***Note that puppy adoption fees most often help generate revenue that goes towards older, special needs animals that need our help. Surgeries, heartworm treatment, boarding costs....all things that often result in adoptable dogs and cats being left behind to be euthanized. So adopting a puppy saves not just one life, but many! \n\nFor more information, please email kberger@petconnectrescue.org\n\n**If you're viewing this on Petfinder, please visit www.petconnectrescue.org to complete our non-binding application.**",

It is a genetic condition in which the part of the brain that controls neuromuscular function doesn't develop properly.  As a result, I have a wonky, wobbly walk and have difficulty with fine motor skills.  I also need help getting up; if I happen to fall over on my side i need you to prop me back up.  I have a cool harness that helps me walk and stand and i also have a wheelchair; although I would prefer to walk on my own with just a little assistance from my person.  I enjoy the company of other dogs but I really love people.  My whole face lights up and I actually smile when I see my person.  I love to cuddle and will scoot myself around the house to be near you.  I am good in a crate but would prefer to sleep in a dog bed next to you.  I am up-to-date on my vaccinations and will come with a spay voucher. If you are interested in meeting me, please contact kathie@heridnghaven.org",

            "description": "Midnight is a beautiful senior gal with a frosty face and a warm, loving personality.  She's been waiting far too long now for a home of her own, after being turned in with Mercedes, another senior dog, in December of 2019.  While we tried for quite some time to get Midnight and Mercedes adopted together, they have shown over the last year that they are not quite as bonded as we initially thought.  Midnight is extremely laid-back at 13 years old while Mercedes is a bit more rambunctious, and their personalities sometimes clash.  They certainly can be adopted together, but do not have to be.  Midnight is such a lady.  She's easy going and well behaved.  She's housebroken and walks well on a leash, and once she gets to know you, she's your very best snuggly friend.  She needs a good diet for seasonal allergies but doesn't ask for much else except a cat-free home.  Please give this sweet and sensational senior a chance.  File#29429  12/10/19\nCall 609-693-1900 or email:  office@ahsppz.org to meet Midnight.\n<p>\nIf interested please visit our Forked River Shelter. We are open Mon. - Fri. from \n12:00 P. M. - 6:00 P. M.; and Sat. & Sun. 12:00 P. M. - 5:00 P. M. for directions call 609-693-1900. There is an adoption donation required. The society cannot accept personal checks but we do accept Visa, MC, AE, Discover and cash. As part of our adoption process, we must have proof of residency. Homeowners must show proof of ownership; landlord approval is required for renters before an adoption can be approved.And as always we thank you for your kindness in opening your heart & home to a Society orphan.",

He is a very affectionate young man that loves to be pet, cuddled, and curled up in your lap for his afternoon naps!  True to his breed, Cookie Dough is an active and energetic dog that loves to run.  He also enjoys playing with stuffed squeaky toys.  As you can see from his photos, he is a bit of a goofball.  His personality is out of this world.  He will need an active family or one with a large fenced in area in order for him to let off his energy.  Meet and greets at our shelter are currently by appointment only so if you are interested in meeting this sweet pup, please call us at the shelter at (828) 488-0418.",

It's long, but worth the read..... she has her own Instagram page at https://instagram.com/juliet_rescue?igshid=a41gj5wt67sc\n\nHello world, my name is Juliet!\n\nI am looking for my new Mommy/Daddy OR even both! - only ones that will never give me up, I'm over that.\n\nDay/Night house trained - I won't use our home as a potty!\n\n***working on separation anxiety and crate training!\n\nWhat you should know about me:\n\nGood with men and women\n\nI'll be your best friend!\n\nEveryone who meets me loves me.\n\nI'm skeptical of new people. So I need a min. But once you're my friend it's forever!\n\nI will love you till the end of time and with me you will never be alone ever again!\n\nI CANT BE WITH OTHER DOGS OR CATS - I've had bad experiences before. SO IM AN ONLY CHILD!!!!\n\neven though I can't be with other dogs, on our walk I don't bark at them, and I wag my tail, so no one gets spooked by me.\n\nI attend Mutt Manners on Sunday's (1h) thanks to one love! - I need to keep doing this for maybe a month or 2 more. Foster mom can explain that fun class...\n\nI'm good with children. Haven't been seen with younger than 3, kids too much but open to meeting them. - I'll be cool if they are also! As long as they are polite kids.\n\nI'm cool with every day noises, blender, Kitchen aid at high speed, pressure cooker, washer/dryer, hair dryer (just don't point it at me my hair is fine!).\n\nI have a slight skin allergy - foster mom said fish oil helped more than anything.\n\nWhen you leave I CAN be out and about, won't destroy our home, just might bark. Working on crate training it's just not my fav place yet.\n\nMY LIKES\n\nPEOPLE! Omg. I love people!\n\nLight walks in the morning & longer walks at night.\n\nI am good with my toys! Sometimes I fetch.\n\nNetflix & Cuddles - oh I'm the best at this.\n\nI like lite playing with my human pals.\n\nTrained to not lay on your bed, but I do like to snuggle with you there!\n\nLOTS OF LOVE\n\nTo see you smile and talk to me.\n\nMY DISLIKES:\n\nOther dogo's - THIS IS A MAJOR NO NO. I'm a one woman show. I didn't get much interaction when I was younger, recently got close to a dog and it didn't go too well. - what I lack in I totally make up for!\n\nBeing alone for too long.\n\nThe idea of going back to the shelter. - I've been passed over far too many times and its left my heart broken. - foster mom, Danielle, is helping me, but I don't think I can survive another broken heart.\n\nFoster Mommy's Notes:\n\nShe is a love! My ideal dog!\n\nCame to me knowing basic dog commands. - we are doing refresher courses\n\nI let her chill on the sofa but she didn't go on it without a sheet, so I think this was trained. But when asked to be off she stays off if her bed is there.\n\nGood on walks - working on her slight pulling. Nothing major. She's getting better.\n\nShe needs to be introduced to her new home over a few 1-5 day period. I am happy to introduce you to her when you are ready, let you walk her with me, and just get to know her.\n\nI think she needs to go to someone who makes her needs a priority and understands that she is a commitment, loves dogs, and won't give her up for anything.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this dog, please text 480-359-7109 for more information or visit the website for our online application www.underdogaz.com. Juliet is with Freedom Brothers Rescue, but you can use this application.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This dog is courtesy posted for another individual or Rescue. Different policies and fees may apply.",

I have a rare condition for a young dog and will need regular monitoring, care and attention at home and regular visits to the vet for frequent testing. I may be blind, but I love training and working for yummy hot dog treats and I am learning quickly. I still love to do normal puppy things like running, playing, meeting new people and pups, and of course snuggling.\n\nIf you think I might be a good fit for and you are ready to take on my medical challenges, please get in touch with the shelter staff to learn more about me!\n\nIf you would like to meet me,  please go to AlexandriaAnimals.org/Adopt-By-Appointment to get more information and to schedule a time to meet with me either via video call or at the shelter.

When they first arrived to SNIPSA, they were bug-eyed, nervous, tails tucked\u2026unsure of their new world. Never having been around humans before, it was understandable. But after a relaxing spa day of warm baths, nail trims, flea and tick removal, and an introduction to big fluffy dog beds, they are LOVING the pet life. The \u201cK Litter\u201d spends their days learning how fun toys can be, snoozing in the sun, and coming out of their shell. It might take a minute for their true personalities to show when you bring one home but after a few days of some patience, love, and routine, the playful and silly puppy personality will shine through! We expect these shepherd mix pups to be medium to large when fully grown. If you\u2019ve been looking for a pup to raise, consider bringing home Kai, Kylo, Kade, or Kyle!

            "description": "Meet, Happy! This little nugget loves to play and always has his tail wagging. He loves toys and is so fun to watch as he pounces on soft squeaky toys twice his size. He loves to snuggle after a good play session and makes a great foot warmer in your work-from-home office. He will choose to sleep on your feet (or lap if accessible) over laying on a cushy dog bed. Happy enjoys trying to copy his big foster siblings and would do well in a home with or without other dogs.\n________________________ This puppy's adoption fee is $400. This does NOT include spay/neuter.\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application and a representative will get back to you shortly to answer any questions you may have. The adoption policies and applications can be found at the following links: www.tinyurl.com/fcrtcats / www.tinyurl.com/fcrtdogs. Email us at adoption@fancycats.org for general questions about our rescued cats. Email us at dogadoptions@fancycats.org for general questions about our rescued dogs.\nYou can save animals like this one by becoming a foster! Fosters are like bridges between high kill shelters and forever homes. We need fosters so that we can save cats and dogs before they are euthanized at the shelters. If you are interested in becoming a foster, please visit: http://fancycats.org/how-you-can-help/foster/foster-application",

He's about 60 pounds and 7 years old He is up-to-date on shots and neutered.\n\nHe is good with people and has lived with other dogs and cats and is good with them also. He's always had a fenced yard so they're not sure how he is without one.\n\nNot sure of his mix but his family thinks could be an Aussie and/or cattle dog mix.\n\nPlease email us at AlmostHome4Dogs@yahoo.com to find out if Shiloh is the right one for you! (Local adoptions preferred - Philadelphia and tri-state area [South Jersey and northern Delaware] only.)\n\nPLEASE READ BEFORE CONTACTING US!\nWe are NOT a shelter: All of our dogs live in private homes with foster families. Come and meet the Almost Home dogs and their fosters at our Meet & Greet events, where you can learn more about our wonderful dogs from the people who live with them, find out which dogs are on their way and when they'll arrive, and fill out an application to adopt or foster.\n\nWe cannot adopt to homes where electric-shock fencing systems or training collars are used. For more information on the dangers of electric-shock collars, please visit banshockcollars.ca/studies.php and http://www.hollysden.com/say_no_to_shock.htm (scroll down and click on the \"Invisible Fencing Systems\" link).\n\nWe do not have an online adoption application; to request an application, e-mail us at AlmostHome4Dogs@yahoo.com. To speed e-mail processing time, be sure to note the name of the dog you are inquiring about in the Subject line. For Meet & Greet times and locations, visit our home page, where you also will find information on our adoption process and fees.\n\nFOSTER FAMILIES ARE LIFESAVERS!! Can you open your heart and home for a few weeks to homeless shelter dog? Remember, by fostering a dog, you save TWO lives - that of your foster dog, and that of the dog who takes his place in the shelter! Come to a Meet & Greet and find out if fostering is for you - there's no reward quite like the feeling that you've saved a life ... or two!",

Dixie loves belly rubs, in fact, she expects her day to start with one.  She likes to hide her treats but living with a beagle, she\u2019s seldom successful in keeping them hid for long.\n\nDixie was heartworm positive when she came into rescue.  She has successfully gone through treatment and is now a healthy, active dog.  One of the conditions that will be required of her adopter is to commit to keeping dixie on monthly heartworm treatment. She is up to date on all vaccinations and has been spayed.\nShe is a hearty eater, practically licking the smell off her bowl. She\u2019s a great snuggler, preferring to be on your lap as much as possible.  Dixie gets along with all other dogs she has met. We\u2019re not aware of her experience with cats or small children. \n\nOur rescue organization only adopts within 3 hour radius from Georgetown, KY.  All our dogs are spayed/neutered and have been fully vetted and current on vaccinations.

Since I\u2019ve been here at TALGV, I\u2019ve become quite popular, mainly because I\u2019m so friendly, patient and good natured. I know how to sit when told and I can use a doggie door. I may be strong, but I do walk well on a leash. Since I recently demonstrated my climbing ability, I will need an enclosure from which I can\u2019t escape. If you aren\u2019t familiar with my breed, I can tell you that I\u2019m playful, endearing, comical, sometimes stubborn, mischievous, but ALWAYS devoted. I actually thrive on affection and exercise. I\u2019m known as the \u201cultimate personality breed.\u201d I\u2019m inviting you to be my guest at a \u201cmeet and greet\u201d where we can get to know each other. Please accept my invitation!\nArrived: 1-24-2021\n1-year-old male Bull Terrier\n\nTo view additional animals and find out more about The Animal League of Green Valley, visit our website at www.talgv.org or call (520) 625-3170 between 10 am and 2 pm Monday though Sunday.",

She has been at the shelter for over 250 days now and is more than ready to find her forever home!\n\nAGE: Approximately 2.5 years.\n\nTRICKS & COMMANDS: Sit\n\nABOUT SALLY: Sally's earned herself the nickname \"Silly Sally\" at the shelter because she's quite the character! She is a happy, bouncy girl with a lot of energy to spare!\n\nSally would thrive in a home that has an active lifestyle--she would be a great running partner! This beautiful, sweet girl has as much love in her heart as she has energy. She will give kisses and snuggles, wiggling the whole time. She is very food motivated and will happily sit for treats. \n\nAdoption fee includes spay/neuter, vaccinations, worming, microchip, and a start on flea/tick prevention.\n\nFor more information, please call CBHS adoptions at 319-232-6887 or email at adoptioncounselor@yahoo.com.",

So if you\u2019re here looking for one of those little dogs you can fit in a tote bag, you might want to scroll elsewhere on the website.\n\nSee, the only bag I\u2019m going to fit into is maybe a sleeping bag if we go camping sometime, but I promise that with my big body also comes a really big heart with a whole lot of love. I am completely happy to spend the day relaxing with my people with maybe a short walk or two. I like to bring my toys to show my foster mom when she comes home, just to know I\u2019ve been thinking about her while she\u2019s away.\n\nI sometimes lean on my people to let them know that I love them and that I\u2019m ready for some affection. I also love to roll in the grass and play with my plushie toys. I\u2019m a pretty stereotypical \u201cgentle giant,\u201d actually. I get along great with other dogs (I live with a couple of chihuahuas in my foster home and they are my best buds!) and I\u2019m just as friendly and easy going as can be. \n\nI know I sound perfect (and, well\u2026.I am!) But here\u2019s the thing. I have some pretty severe allergies and I don\u2019t think anyone has offered me a lot of medical support for them until coming to PawsCo. So I have a lot of catching up to do to get my allergies under control. PawsCo has invested SO much in identifying what my allergies are and the most effective way to get me back to a healthy place. So that\u2019s a great thing! The tough thing is that my medication and special food is all quite pricey (due to the medication itself and also because I\u2019m so big!) For the next 6-12 months, my overall monthly cost will be in the $480-$500/month range. From there, my monthly food/medication cost should drop to $280-$300/month (because I\u2019ll be able to wean off one of the pricier meds at that point.) PawsCo can give you a ton more information but our team asks that you only apply for me if you\u2019re comfortable with supporting long-term medication needs for a pup my size. \n\nDo you have (a lot) of room in your heart for someone like me?

I was picked up as a stray in Cedar City and spent a stint in the Iron County shelter before making my way to Herding Haven rescue.  I'm very shy with people at first; but, once I warm up to you I will follow you everywhere and shower you with soft kisses.  I love other dogs (in fact, another dog in the home is a requirement to adopt me); my cute, playful personality really comes out when I am around other dogs.  Because of my timid nature, a relatively calm and quiet home would be best for me.  I am good in my crate, potty-trained and learning to walk on a leash (leashes still make me a little nervous).  I am neutered and up-to-date on vaccinations. If you are interested in meeting me, please contact kathie@herdinghaven.org",

A family member developed a severe allergy to her so they sadly had to make this decision to surrender. She is said to be affectionate, cuddly, independent, friendly, & loves to play. She is on a special food for her skin sensitivity and will need a prescription. She's been around newborns- adults. She is friendly with other dogs but has never been around cats. She is smart and knows how to sit, stay & walks well on the leash. She's had behavioral training and loves squeaky toys. If you are interested click on her picture and apply at humanesocietycc.org",

He was pulled from a shelter with a broken leg and he was sent to surgery needing pin placement to recover the broken area.  He is currently in rehab and patiently waiting for them to repair the water treadmill to help in his rehab. \nTipper is crate trained and almost house trained ( he lets you know when he needs to go outside.  He does well on a leash and is up to walking for 20 minutes.  Tipper would do best with older children as he is mouthy to get attention.  Working with a trainer will help curb this habit.  Tipper would benefit from a yard he can run in as he is energetic and active. \nHe loves to get on the couch next to you and sack out. Tipper loves to chew on hoofs and a kong. He loves to play and just wants to be with you.  \nIf you are interested in meeting or adopting Tipper, we have a convenient online application which is the first step.

            "description": "Gem is a beautiful 4 year old mixed breed female that is hoping to find a loving forever home.  She is a social and friendly girl that likes to be around people and enjoys attention. She is eager to please and knows the sit command.  She takes treats very gently.  Gem is not always fond of other dogs and would prefer to be the only pet in a home.  \n\nThe NAWS Dog Adoption Program operates as a rescue versus a shelter.  We believe in matching the right dog with the appropriate family based on each specific dog or family's needs.  To achieve this, we believe in spending the appropriate amount of time with each family to allow for enough interaction time with potential adopters.  This cannot be achieved if people stop by unexpectedly to meet our dogs.  Please e-mail Stacy at stacy@nawsus.org to setup a day or time to meet with one of our adoption counselors and our potential adoptees.  Thank you!\n",

The foster mom had this to say about her \"She is fine with our three cats and looks to our dog for reassurance and guidance.  She has perfect house manners and is housebroken as far as we have seen.  She walks well on a leash and enjoys exploring our neighborhood.  She does not enjoy the car but maybe as she becomes more confident that could change.\" Linda might be an adult but she sure does like to chew things like a puppy so will need to be watched for that.   Linda is considered special needs because of an old injury and may or may not need surgery in the future.  We have done Xrays and consulted with an orthopedic vet and she determined that Linda does not currently need surgery but may or may not need surgery in the future. Linda is a very calm dog and not super active so does not appear to be in any pain. If you think Linda would be happy in your home then please fill out an online application today.\n\nVisit the following section of our website if you are interested in adopting Linda:\nhttps://www.capeannanimalaid.org/adopt.html\n\nIMPORTANT:  We strongly recommend checking our website for information on adoption policies and procedures.

Ariel, our 10 month-old Feist/All-American Mutt mix is up to the challenge! This adorable and very outgoing pup was at an overcrowded rural county dog shelter before coming to Canine Lifeline to find herself the perfect new home. While we don't have any history on Ariel's pre-shelter life, we have found this girl to be an absolute delight-active, energetic, affectionate, and super playful! She is going to need an active family who can match her energy level and make sure she has plenty of opportunity for exercise, mental stimulation, and training each day. Ariel loves other dogs so would certainly enjoy having a playful canine buddy in her new home. She seems to respond to the sit command when offered a tasty treat (at least most of the time!) and is eager to learn lots more in her new home. Ariel hasn't had much leash work to date as she's all over the place when on a walk. She loves to explore so it's just a matter of daily practice and experience to get her more comfortable on a leash. Ariel has done well with crate-training in her foster home so we expect she should be able to master the house rules quickly in her new home. This girl LOVES toys of all kinds so would enjoy having an overflowing toy box in her new home. Ariel met the resident kitty at the vet clinic and was very curious and attempted to play with her although the kitty wasn't interested in engaging with Ariel. This fabulous young dog is going to make an outstanding companion for the person or family who has the time to spend with an active, energetic, enthusiastic pup. Ariel weighs about 24 pounds and her adoption fee is $375. She's spayed, heartworm negative and on monthly preventative, up to date on vaccinations including bivalent canine influenza, wormed, on flea and tick preventative, and microchipped. The bandages on her back paws in the photos are from having her dewclaws removed during her spay. As part of the adoption process, all adopters must commit to a two-week adjustment period to make sure it's a great match before the adoption is finalized. Please email info@caninelifeline.org if you're interested in Ariel. An approved application is required before we schedule meets with any of our dogs. Please note that we don't place our dogs in homes with children under 7 years of age. We correspond via email so please check your junkmail or spam folder to make sure our reply hasn't landed in there. Please visit our website at www.caninelifeline.org to see more photos of Ariel and to submit an online application if you live in Northeast OH.",

She is a beautiful girl who is shy and uncertain in this new landscape. Unlike most of our canine companions, many dogs like Sierra never lived in a home, experienced the regular day to day goings on of a household or the typical noises and actions that we know as normal. They also aren't used to regular human interactions like the snuggling, walking and playing that we do with our dogs. Almost like a puppy, they need to learn from scratch.  We promise that with the Misfits, Sierra will get the opportunity to relax, unwind and learn about this new world at her own pace. We are confident that Sierra will blossom with slow and steady consideration.",

I'm the perfect mix of playful energy and cuddle bug. I spent 2 weeks learning to be a good boy, so I need a family willing to continue to help me remember how. I absolutely LOVE water and would be your best swimming buddy if you let me! I have done well with other large dogs but would do best without cats or small dogs. Because I can be selective with my dog friends, a meet-and-greet with your other dog should happen before you take me home, or I should go to a home as the only dog. Being surrendered at a shelter has been stressful for me, and I'll need someone who can be patient with me and not rush introductions with strangers. If you are willing to give me some time to get to know you, I am a wonderful and loyal companion.",

He is affectionate and sweet, and despite his large size, things he is a lap dog!  He loves attention and enjoys pets.  Ziggy is not fond of other dogs and is looking for a home where he can be the only pet.\n\nThe NAWS Dog Adoption Program operates as a rescue versus a shelter.  We believe in matching the right dog with the appropriate family based on each specific dog or family's needs.  To achieve this, we believe in spending the appropriate amount of time with each family to allow for enough interaction time with potential adopters.  This cannot be achieved if people stop by unexpectedly to meet our dogs.  Please e-mail Stacy at stacy@nawsus.org to setup a day or time to meet with one of our adoption counselors and our potential adoptees.  Thank you!\n",

We don't know her true past but we do know she is frightened by new people and new experiences. But she is sweet as pie once she gets to know you and she's dog friendly. Since Maizie has never had anything constant in her young life, she treasures what she does have and can be protective over her person especially children, she loves them. This is not a flaw. She has the potential to pull out of the behavior given someone will dedicate their time to her. She is house trained, and knows basic commands. Maizie absolutely deserves her forever. It is not her fault someone chose to not spay/neuter their pets and she was the result. Maizie is UTD on vaccines, dewormer, rabies shot, she's spayed, and she's microchipped. If interested you can apply at http://www.hshcwv.org/wanting-to-adopt.html, her adoption fee is $125. Please note we are operating by appointment with approved applications only at this time.",

With the help of some very dedicated volunteers, they are very social puppies that love people. We have no idea how big they will be, but they will not be small. They would be great pups for a family with children of all ages. There adoption fee is $200 for a foster to adopt.

            "description": "For the love of fluffy butts meet Rico. Rico is a Pomeranian around 10 yrs old we think. He was found in a park. Rico is housetrained, he loves going in and out the doggie door. He does play a little bit if you are on the floor with him. Rico loves car rides and walks. He is fine with other dogs and we assume cats too. He is about 8 lbs. Rico loves food too. He will snuggle with you for a bit but gets a little hot and just wants his bed to lay in. He is too old to be a toy dog for young kids. Rico came in with bad teeth so we gave him a dental. When Rico came to us he seemed fine but then had a couple of seizures, a few were stress related but we are just not sure what is causing the issues. We have done two sets of blood work and x-rays. He is on phenobarbital and a low protein diet that might have to be on the rest of his life.\nTo help pay for vet bills and care (transportation, food, toys, etc..) a $250 donation is requested at the time of adoption. All of our adoptions are contingent upon an approved application, home visit, reference check, obedience training agreement, and signing of adoption contract. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, and microchipped before adoption. Our dogs are companion animals that live indoors as part of your family. Please do not apply if your plan is to have them as outside dogs, garage dogs, porch dogs or outside kennel dogs. We do not ship dogs.\nAll of our dogs are in private foster homes. We are not a shelter with hours. A visit can be arranaged after an adoption questionnaire has been filled out and sent in. Please try email first. We are all volunteers that work so we can not easily take or make phone calls.",

Please visit http://www.caninelifeline.org/adoption-process/ for more information about our adoption process and to submit an online application.\n\nJaxson is a very friendly and outgoing 1-2 year-old Husky/Rottie mix neutered male with one sparkling blue eye and lots of puppy energy. This boy has never met a stranger and seems to make fast friends with all dogs and people that he meets. He found himself homeless at an overcrowded rural county dog shelter and when he wasn't claimed there, made the trip to Canine Lifeline so he could take his time finding the perfect new home. Jaxson will eagerly sit for a treat and may know more commands that we haven't discovered yet. He does need work on taking treats gently though and generally channeling all of that puppy energy in a positive direction. Jaxson LOVES toys of all kinds and was eager to raid the toybox at the end of his photo shoot. He has not had much leash training to date and tends to pull so will need some work in that area. Walking him on a harness as he works on his leash manners will be very helpful. Once he's got some obedience mastered, he's going to make an outstanding running, hiking, or walking buddy. Jaxson did meet the resident kitty at the vet clinic and was very interested and animated with her so likely too exuberant to live peacefully with kitties at this point. He has done well with crate-training in his foster home and may be housetrained too although we can't guarantee it. This big overgrown puppy would love a large yard with an aboveground fence so he could run and play with his new family to his heart's content. Jaxson weighs about 61 pounds and his adoption fee is $350. He's neutered, heartworm negative and on monthly preventative, up to date on vaccinations including bivalent canine influenza, wormed, on flea and tick preventative, and microchipped. As part of the adoption process, all adopters must commit to a two-week adjustment period to make sure it's a great match before the adoption is finalized. Please email info@caninelifeline.org if you're interested in Jaxson. An approved application is required before we schedule meets with any of our dogs. Please note that we don't place our dogs in homes with children under 7 years of age. We correspond via email so please check your junkmail or spam folder to make sure our reply hasn't landed in there. Please visit our website at www.caninelifeline.org to see more photos of Jaxson and to submit an online application if you live in Northeast OH.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\n\nTrue to her name, 11-week-old Felicity is 11 pounds worth of pure bliss. Percolating with puppy pep and personality, she loves snuggling with her foster mom and napping on her lap in between playing with toys and with her doggy foster brother, following him everywhere he goes. Two of her cutest quirks are crawling back and forth under the couch and if her paws get cold outside she jumps on her foster brother's back to warm them up. Never one to turn down treats or food, she's bright as a button and easy to teach, learning \"come\", \"sit\" and \"stay\" and is at work on her leash, crate and housetraining (after all, she IS still a puppy!). Now, with her whole life ahead of her, friendly Felicity will thrive in a loving home, preferably with another playful pup and patient adopters to complete her training, educate her fully and keep her happily active fur-ever.\n\nAnimal Rescue of the Rockies believes that every pet should find a wonderful, caring home. To ensure each pet finds the best possible home, we ask that you fill out our Adoption Application so we can learn more about you and your household. We review each application we receive and will contact you within 48 hours. If your home sounds like a good match for you and the pet,\n\nthe next step is to set up a \"meet and greet.\" After meeting the pet, if you would like to proceed with adopting, we'll ask that you read and sign our Adoption Agreement and pay the adoption fee. Our adoption fees help cover the costs of saving more lives!\n\nA home visit will be scheduled within one week of your new pet going home with you.\n\nThe adoption fee for this pet is $395. Our adoption fee covers the following:\n\n- Spay/Neuter, Microchip\n\n- DAPP vaccinations as age appropriate for dog - adopter shall be responsible for all DAPP boosters after adoption.\n\n- Rabies vaccinations as age appropriate for dog - adopter shall be responsible for any rabies vaccinations after adoption.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out an adoption application by clicking\n\nhere\n\n.\n\nWe want our pets to go to a lifelong new home, so thank you for your patience during the adoption process!\n\nPlease email ARRColorado@gmail.com for more information, as we can not accept calls at this time.\n\nOur adoption process is:\n\n1. Fill out our Adoption Application online. We'll contact you within 48 hours to answer any questions you may have about the pet.\n\n2. If the pet looks like a great match, we'll schedule a meet and greet and ask you to fill out our online Adoption Agreement if you'd like to proceed with adopting. Once you've completed the Adoption Agreement and pay the pet's Adoption Fee, you can arrange to pick up your new furry family member!",

Cypress was a great momma dog and now that they are getting homes of their own she is ready to find her forever home and happiness by being your dog! She is great with people, attentive, and affectionate. Cypress is good with other dogs too. Cypress has her birthday in September ( 09/03/2019). Cypress is a super happy girl, bouncing around with a loose and wiggly body. Very friendly with staff and volunteers. Cypress walks on a leash, knows sit, very curious, super easy to handle, very energetic, good with kids, and good with dogs. Cypress seems to have never met a stranger and wants to be everyone's friend. While fostered Cypress was found to do very well when crated at night. Calm, relaxed, and did not bark or fuss. Very playful and craving affection. Likes toys. Visit Cypress at HSO!\n****************\nAll animals at HSO are current on their vaccinations and will be spayed/neutered prior to adoption. If not already spayed/neutered, there may be a short delay between when you select this pet and when they are ready to go home.\n\nBreed and age are determined based on observable physical traits. Actual lineage and birth date are rarely know.\n\nAdoption Fees:\nCats $50\nDogs 6 years and over $50\nDogs 6 months to 5 years $75\nPuppies under 6 months $100\n\nCome visit our pets Tuesday-Saturday, 10am-2pm.",

First, dogs just want to be happy and feel loved. Living inside and being a part of the family is really important to us. A lot of the things you need as humans to stay happy and healthy, us dogs need too. We depend on you for things like vet visits, nutritious food, clean water, social and play time with people and other pets, training classes, toys, and of course, lots of love and attention! Regular baths, nail trims and grooming help us to look and feel our best, while monthly flea and heartworm prevention help us to stay healthy. Did you know that depending on our size and breed, dogs can live up to 20 years? Just think of the wonderful life we could have together!",

While Tyson was at the Trenton shelter, they had him neutered and assessed some masses that he has. After examining him, our vet has elected to have his largest mass examined by ultrasound. Tyson's vet appointment is on February 16th, and we eagerly await good news. Tyson is a low energy dog who is content to do a few short walks throughout the day and snuggle up the rest of the time. He would be fine in a home with another dog and with children, but no kitties for this guy. He is housetrained, walks nicely on a leash and most of all, just wants to give and receive love. Can you give Tyson the loving retirement home he needs and so deserves?\n\nPlease note: Due to high volume, email inquiries will not be returned. Please go to our website, complete an online application (if you haven't already) and indicate which animal(s) you are interested in. Once approved, you will be contacted to schedule an adoption appointment.

He loves singing to you in his wonderfully hound-y voice and is eager for pets and attention. He'd love an outdoorsy family who like to spend time exercising and playing in the yard with him. He's been bounced around a lot already, so he could use a consistent routine that makes him feel more confident. He's a little leery when strangers handle his collar, and can be shy in new situations, but overcomes that with the joy of meeting new friends! He's been playful with other dogs (just a little more work on manners wouldn't hurt) but has been reported to chase and harm cats in a previous home - please no cats!",

She is extremely friendly and social with people but can be a bit jumpy (that's just because her legs get SO EXCITED to meet people). She does know \"sit\", \"down\" and \"shake\" very well and also seems friendly with other dogs. Simone does fancy herself as a larger than life lap dog but we just think that makes her more lovable. She is easily redirected from jumping if you ask her to \"sit\" and plays very well with toys. Simone is definitely a higher energy dog but one we think is also highly trainable and easy to please their person. If you think that Simone is the gal for you then consider applying to adopt her!",

He has greeted other dogs in a friendly manner and super social with people once he's comfortable. Mr. Wilson is nervous of loud sounds and probably wouldn't be well suited for apartment living since he can have a loud howl if he gets in the mood. He is VERY interested in food and is probably going to be more of an independent dog in a new home. If you're interested in adopting Wilson consider submitting an application for him!",

            "description": "Meet Dagger!  Dagger is a 6-month-old playful Great Pyrenees puppy ready for his forever home.  Dagger is a typical puppy that comes with puppy shenanigans like chewing your favorite chair leg and running away with your shoes, but he wants you to know he's a very good boy and he loves to snuggle and give you lots and lots of puppy kisses.\n\nDagger is good on a leash and he is doing great at learning basic training, but typical of the breed, he will do them on his time when he's good and ready. All he wants are snacks, toys, a soft sofa to snuggle on, and more snacks.  A good ball for him to fetch would be great, too!\n\nDagger would do best in an active household with another dog to play with and kids over 6 due to his size.  A fully fenced yard is required as well as Great Pyrenees experience. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please apply online, at https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/ then email Debbie@BigFluffyDogs.com\n\nOur main website, www.bigfluffydogs.com has more information about us and the rescue process. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters should understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. Homes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for 1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (i.e. a 4-month-old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break). 2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise. 3.) Socialization.  The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home. 4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded ten-fold, for years to come.  Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy.  Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time-consuming and can be expensive. All dogs require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well-socialized dog is more than worth the effort to get them there.",

Puppies are adopted on a foster-to-adopt basis until the puppy is old enough to be neutered/spayed (we prefer them to be no younger than 7 months for females and 9 months for males). Houses with pools must demonstrate that puppies can be protected from the pool with fencing or a cover. Home visits for shots will be required, so puppies are adopted to homes in Maricopa County only. Puppies often have multiple potential adopters, so SPR evaluates what home is best matched with any given puppy and their expected home needs once they have grown.  \n\nSirus\n\n\n\nIf you can give Sirus an indoor forever home, please fill out our online application on our website at http://www.savingpawsrescueaz.com/adoption-form/  \n\n We will only schedule meet and greets with an approved application. We are an all-volunteer organization.  It may take a couple of days to process an application and complete reference checks.\n\nThank you for your interest in saving the life of a puppy and providing for it's FOREVER home.",

Hix separation anxiety is not related to any bad behaviors.  He is very smart and so willing to please.  It is a mental condition just like any mental illness with  people.  You can't train it out of him but you can give him structure, consistency, appropriate exercise and companionship to diminish its affects.   And that is exactly what he is getting in his foster home and he is thriving being the perfect gentleman.  No separation anxiety is being displayed in his current foster.\nTo adopt Bentley adopters must be willing:\n1.  Willing to work with our vet at West Park Animal Hospital to maintain his medications and appropriate doses.  These are drugs that can be called in to any pharmacy.\n2.  Live within 30 minutes Elyria/Grafton area for his foster parents and trainer to give appropriate support to new adopter.\n3.  Have another doggie companion for him to hang out with and play with.\n4.  Have a fenced in yard\n5.  Have someone who works from home or only works part time outside of the home so he does not have to be crated 8 hours daily.\n\n",

Since then, Goldie has blossomed into the sweet, loving girl that we know she is. She even loves hanging out in the office to keep us company!\n\nAGE: Approximately 5 years.\n\nTRICKS & COMMANDS: Sit\n\nABOUT GOLDIE: Goldie is a very people-oriented, sweet, lady. She has a happy, bouncy, personality and would do best in an active home that can help her burn off some energy. \n\nGoldie enjoys playing with toys, (especially tug of war!), and will sit happily on command for a yummy treat. She loves to show you when she's happy by wagging her tail and giving you an adorable smile with her teeth peeking out!\n\nGoldie has a unique, rambunctious, and \"over the top\" meeting style with other dogs, which can be overbearing for other dogs, so it would be best for Goldie to meet others in the home prior to adoption.\n\nAdoption fee includes spay/neuter, vaccinations, worming, microchip, and a start on flea/tick prevention.\n\nFor more information, please call CBHS adoptions at 319-232-6887 or email at adoptioncounselor@yahoo.com.",

Only 4 years old and 48 lbs, he has a huge head with short legs. Pictures will be up this week with more information about this sweet boy but the rescuer did state he loves people.

He spent many hours a day on a short chain in the bed of a pick up truck. He was also allowed to run loose being chased off by people. Living this chaotic lifestyle has made him weary of strangers and other dogs. His owner decided to get a new puppy and bring him to the shelter because he did not get along with the puppy due to his puppy behavior. He has entropy in his left eye and has caused injury to his eye. We are hoping with medical intervention his eye can be saved. He is also high heartworm positive. This boy is much better behaved at the shelter than he was with his owner. He has taken to shelter staff and enjoys meeting strangers and accepting treats. The shelter can tell a big difference in his overall demeanor and the shelter staff would love someone to give this boy a second chance at a happy life. \nHe is not available for adoption at this time. He is only available for rescue. Once a rescue has time to assess him and his medical issues he should be available for adoption. \nIf you are with a rescue PLEASE contact the shelter directly to learn more about this beautiful boy.",

            "description": "Hi, my name is Gabby. I am a little 8 week old bundle of baby girl Chihuahua and possibly terrier. I will probably top out at 20-25 lbs. I have my first shots and am ready to roll.\n\nPuppies require an adopter who is home a good part of the day to continue their training - no exceptions! They are up-to-date on age appropriate vaccines and preventatives and will need to be spayed/neutered at the age of 6 months. Please note, this pup's immune system will not be fully functioning until about 16 weeks of age and therefore, s/he is not suited for Apartment/Condo living or Town homes without a private fenced yard and will not be able to go to public places where s/he could possibly be exposed to the germs of unvaccinated dogs, such as PetSmart/PetCo and dog parks until s/he is 16 weeks old.\n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $375, which helps with the cost of routine vet care. This fee DOES NOT INCLUDE spay/neuter if the pup is not already spayed/neutered. If the animal you are adopting is not already spayed/neutered, you will be required to sign a contract legally obligating you to have the animal altered. ***Note that puppy adoption fees most often help generate revenue that goes towards older, special needs animals that need our help. Surgeries, heartworm treatment, boarding costs....all things that often result in adoptable dogs and cats being left behind to be euthanized. So adopting a puppy saves not just one life, but many! \n\nFor more information, please email kberger@petconnectrescue.org\n\n**If you're viewing this on Petfinder, please visit www.petconnectrescue.org to complete our non-binding application.**",

            "description": "Wyatt - approximately 8-9 years old, 43 lbs, neutered male, probably a Husky/Chow or Husky/Aussie mix.  \n\nWyatt was a stray who came into one of the animal control facilities that we regularly work with and he soon won the hearts of all the Animal Control Officers.  Wyatt is indeed a lover, but he\u2019s also very unsure of what it means to live in a house and to have people treating him with kindness, love, and respect.  \n\nWhen Wyatt first came to the foster home, he was extremely unsettled.  He clearly did not understand what he was supposed to do or how he was supposed to react to household activities.  If he was crated or tethered, he was calm and looked like he felt safe.  If he could wander free, he would wander non-stop, clearly restless and lost.  Once restricted again, he would sigh and settle right down.  After several weeks, the restlessness finally started to subside, although it is not totally gone.  If his foster Mom is in motion, then Wyatt is right beside, behind or in front of her.  After about 5 months in foster care, Wyatt has become more approving of himself, prouder of himself, more confident, with much better focus.  \n\nWyatt is essentially a plush, loveable teddy bear of a dog; however, he has two major issues.  Despite every effort, he cannot be fully housetrained.  He will appropriately pee and poop outside, but he retains a marking habit indoors.  Wyatt has been trained to wear a male diaper when indoors, and that, coupled with a degree of restriction can reduce or eliminate the marking behavior.  \n\nThe second issue is Wyatt\u2019s almost single-minded focus on food.  He will counter surf, stove surf, and even try to grab food on your plate or in your hand.  He has tried to climb into the dishwasher to get at dirty dishes.  He will eat anything food-related, even a container that had food in it.  Wyatt\u2019s foster mom has to be careful about dropping food on the floor or doling out treats to the whole pack of dogs.\n\nWyatt also has easy, uncomplicated, and straightforward traits.  He responds well to grooming and handling.  He rides well in a car and is eager to jump in and go.  Wyatt is crate trained.  He stays in a closed crate when his foster Mom leaves the house and he sleeps in a closed crate at night in the foster Mom\u2019s bedroom.  He follows his foster Mom from room to room but will usually settle in a designated spot and go to sleep.  He gets along quite well with the other dogs in the house, as well as with the three cats, although he clearly did not have much socialization with dogs in his earlier life.  Wyatt walks well on a leash with a \u201cno-pull\u201d harness.   \n\nWyatt is a younger senior dog.  He has some cataract development, not unusual for his age.  He also has significant hearing loss, although he responds to certain sounds if within about 10 feet.  He will respond to \u201ckissy\u201d sounds, loud handclaps, and a handbell.  Wyatt is otherwise a healthy boy.  \n\nCareful management is the key to living happily with Wyatt.  He will need to wear a belly band/male diaper when indoors to preserve his adopter\u2019s sanity.  We have also determined that he will be most comfortable in a home with at least one other easy-going dog.  He clearly takes comfort from his foster dog pack and he did not do well in another foster home without a canine companion.  \n\nWyatt would do best with a person or people who have a calmer lifestyle and a peaceful home.  Wyatt would not do well in a home with children due to his obsessiveness over food.  Wyatt\u2019s adopter should also be willing to make regular use of crating and tethering for the dog\u2019s comfort.\n\nIf you are someone who is looking for the unconditional love that only a dog can provide but is willing to live with canine imperfection; someone with patience and the ability to empathize while a new dog finds himself in his new environment; someone who wants to adopt an older dog and just love him to pieces until the end then Wyatt might just be your perfect match!\n\nIf you are interested in any of our rescues, please fill out our non-binding application which can be found here - www.hedgesvillehounds.com (or https://hedgesvillehounds.wixsite.com/home).

PLEASE READ\n\nPosted animals are physically located at the above address except when indicated with the following notations after the animal's name:\n\nAnimal Name (FC=initials) -- indicates the animal is living in Foster Care. To meet the animal, please contact the foster directly when contact information is provided; otherwise call the shelter at 434 263-7722.\n\nAnimal Name (COURTESY) - this animal is posted as a public courtesy using information provided by the owner. Our shelter does not own or guarantee the information provided by the owner to be complete and accurate. Also, adoption does not involve our shelter but is strictly between the adopter and the owner.\n\nGOOD NATURED, SWEET GIRLUPDATE 1/29/21: (Written by Sigrid)\nSweet Melissa is a Hound (mix) who is about 18 months old and weighs 51 pounds. When she was vetted and spayed on 1/26/21 she tested NEGATIVE times 4 on her 4DX test-this is always GREAT news. She has such a good nature and was even sweet during her vet appointment.\nMelissa is the definition of hound-ready to go, full of play, a strong voice when needed, good-natured, and most of all lovable.\nHer sleek tri-colored coat begs you to touch it, and if you do, she will reward you with giddy happiness. This type of coat is an easy keeper-a few sweeps with a soft bristle brush and occasional bath will keep her looking perfect.\nMelissa is an athletic dog that is looking for fun and direction. At only 18 months old and 51 pounds, she is just moving out of being a pup and ready to learn all the lessons to become a great home companion. She loves attention and treats, and toys make her really pay attention. (A treat motivated dog is often a dog who learns things quickly because they love being rewarded with delicious things.) So far, she thinks all people are wonderful and when I introduced her to our cats, she thought they were interesting, but she was respectful toward them.\nThis healthy girl needs active folks willing to put a little time in to teach her what she should know. Exercise is important so an enclosed yard where she can run, play games, and fetch balls is ideal.\nIf you think you would like to include a sweet hound in your life and experience their legendary kind of love and devotion, Melissa is waiting.\nNOTE: All animals are spayed/neutered as soon as practical after arriving at our facility unless there is a medical issue that may cause a delay or they are too young to be spayed/neutered.
