Lol\nHe wants a calm and loving household. He\u2019d love to be the only dog, but is fine with smaller dogs, big dogs he\u2019s kind of intimidated by! \nNo young kids, like I said he gets stressed out. \nHe\u2019s about 2 years old. Fully vetted, and neutered and microchipped! \nHe\u2019s good on a leash, loves car rides, and loves sleeping in bed with his human! \nIf interested in this little guy, please fill out an application at danteshope.com",

Luna is a bit of a special girl as she was on the run in Louisiana for 4 months until she was finally trapped by animal control. She is now in a loving foster home in Louisiana learning the joy and comfort of being an inside dog. Luna is coming to NJ February 6th and needs a special home to keep her safe and teach her love. Luna is a flight risk and will required an experienced adopter who will take the proper precautions for her.\n\nLuna is dog friendly! She seems to be afraid of the outdoor cats around her Louisiana foster home. She has been fixed, microchipped and she is up to date on vaccines. Luna is heartworm negative. Her adoption fee is $400.\n\nHow to Adopt Me!\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about me, and possibly making me part of your family, please go to wagoninn.rescuegroups.org. Click on the orange Online Adoption Application button to fill out an application. A Wag On Inn volunteer will be in touch soon!",

Those emails will not be answered.\nAdoption fees for NY dogs is $800 as we are having to use a cargo flying company to bring in the dogs from China. $800 does actually not cover the whole cost. We are fundraising the rest.\n\nThis is Batman. He is a stray from China.\n\n\nHere's what the rescue from China said about this dog:\nBatman is 1 year old. Personality: lively and clingy, curious about the world, and gets along well with people and other dogs. He was found in the flowerbed behind the garage of the community that there was rubbish all around. The kind people put up cardboard boxes. Due to the very cold weather and the small dogs, the team decided to take them in.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out the form here:\n\nhttps://homeboundhoundz.com/application-form",

Please read our Frequently Asked Questions and Adoption Processed Explained documentation.\n_________ B I O ______________\n\nName:Diamond\nSize: ~Medium range: 26-60 lbs\nAdoption Donation:$250 (applicable sales tax included).Adoption fees may be paid by cash or check.\nOther:Spayed Female, Vaccinations current, Microchip, Dog-savvy cats only\n\nDiamondis looking for that special place just for her...is it with you?\n\nFoster Home Feedback\n\n*\nDiamond has been diagnosed with Dynamic Right Ventricular Outflow Tract Obstruction. This means the right side of her heart collapses when it pumps causing a swishing sound resulting in a grade 2 heart murmur. This is a mild heart condition but does require she be on Enalapril 10mg once a day, the cost of this medication is $25 per month. Diamond also has food sensitivities and requires a special diet. She is on Royal Canin Hydrolyzed Protein Diet. The cost of this food is about $97.00 for a 25-pound bag. ~ Diamond also experiences intermittent bouts of vomiting/urping, and she is on Metoclopramide to help prevent this and treat /nauseousness. The cost of this medication is $19 per month\n\n1/27/21: Diamond is a very special dog who - like most dogs - won't be perfect for every family, but for that special family she will be an irreplaceable and beyond perfect addition.\n\nDiamond came to us very very scared of life and unbeknownst to any in the rescue, very sick. Over the past 5 months as our foster, she has become the best version of her healthy self and is working on adjusting to life as a house pet.\n\nShe is the most stoic and non-reactive dog we have ever had as our foster. Diamond is very good with all dogs she has met and has become a polite housemate to our cat (she was a little too interested in our cat for the first few weeks but with time learned that our cat is basically \"one of the dogs\". I feel Diamond would do ok in a home with cats who are dog-savvy. She has learned to like playing with our dogs on occasion but for the most part, loves to just curl up in one of the many dog beds we have laying around the house and snooze the day away in a peaceful home.\n\nDiamond kennels beautifully and I've honestly only heard her bark a few times in the past 5 months as our foster. And each time it was just a single bark because she was upset about something, like not being picked first for going on a walk. Diamond walks great with her harness and passes dogs and people she sees like a champ. Although she's a little too timid to initiate meeting people, she is always polite.\n\nDiamond prefers a peaceful and quiet home, so I feel a home with children would not be her ideal fit. She would love a small family, with maybe a doggy playmate to show her the world isn't so scary, and most importantly someone to love her and give her the time she needs to adjust and learn that life isn't something to be scared of.\n\nEveryone who has ever met Diamond has instantly fallen in love with her soulful eyes and gentle being. She is one of the most memorable and amazing fosters we have ever had (and we've had many!). I encourage you to fill out an application if you feel you are her forever family.Click here to watch a video of Diamond.To view additional dogs available for adoption, please see our website: www.4luvofdog.org",

I enjoy long walks in the park, peanut butter and sunsets. I love greeting new human and dog friends with a tail wag and a smile. I've been told I have a great smile. Sports? Sure, I like sports... as long as I'm watching them from the sofa. I also enjoy watching wild animals hunting on the nature channel. It reminds me of how good I've got it, I only have to hunt in the kitchen! I'm so hilarious, I'm the only one who gets my jokes. If you would like to share a laugh, come by the animal shelter and say hi!",

I am a male and I am not neutered but have done extremely well with going outside only. I enjoy toys and older children. I am missing part of one ear and most of my tail. I get a little nervous around toddlers. I am currently staying in Neillsville, Wi with my foster family. I love playing outside in the snow and laying on the couch with my foster kids. I do not bark unless I have to go outside. \nI am still getting used to being indoors, so a bit nervous yet but I would make a great addition to your Family!  If you think we would make a good match you can apply to adopt me at the following site. \nwww.lastpawrescue.com\n\nMy adoption fee is $150 +$100 refundable neuter deposit \n\n501(c) approved WI agricultural license 285589 DS",

Those emails will not be answered.\nAdoption fees for NY dogs is $800 as we are having to use a cargo flying company to bring in the dogs from China. $780 does actually not cover the whole cost. We are fundraising the rest.\n\nThis is September. She is a stray from China.\n\n\nHere's what the rescue from China said about her:\nShe's an unwanted stray wandering on the streets for way too long so much so that her nails have gone ingrown and bleeding.   September was perhaps spared by Meat Trader as she's considered unworthy of meat - thank God!  She was rescued and ready for Adoption!  \n\nSweet-natured September is 1 year old, spayed, and is sensitive to human facial expressions.  She loves to please her owner and is friendly to humans and dogs.  Due to a long-period of wandering on the streets, she got accustomed to eating food from trash cans and is still interested in ransacking the garbage bins, which can be fixed with a bit of training. She's a great dog.\n\nWeight: 4 kg\nMeasurement: 36cm Length and 31cm Height\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out the form here:\n\nhttps://homeboundhoundz.com/application-form\n",

Please email the completed application to newleashrescue2018@gmail.com\n\nZoey is around six years old and a Pitbull mix.  She weighs about 45 pounds.   She is super sweet and loving and gets a happy wiggle butt and gives you kisses.  \n\nZoey has lived with kids before and did great and she is good with other dogs.  She is unknown with cats.   She kennels well when her foster leaves and she rides in the car well.  \n\nWe will not adopt pitbulls to rentals due to the difficulty in finding other rentals where they are allowed.   \n\nShe's quite the catch!  \n\nAdoption fee is $350.00 + tax (no checks)\n\nFoster to contact: Katie - kit_n_caboodle22@hotmail.com \n\nThis dog will be at our adoption event at the Woodbury PetSmart on Saturday from 11-2 looking for a home!\n\n\nOur fosters do the best they can to provide all information about the animal's background and temperament while in foster care in their home. An adopters routine and home environment is likely going to be different than that in their foster home. \n\nSometimes there is more that comes out about a dog's personality once they have been able to settle in a home and truly become comfortable. There are great articles out there written about the different stages a pet goes through after adoption, discussing transitions that happen at 3 days, 3 weeks, and 3 months. We highly recommend reading about this - it will help you understand the transition your new pet goes through.",

All of the drivers fell in love with her! Fern is still losing her pregnancy weight - she gave birth to 5 puppies in November. As soon as her mammary glands shrink more, she will be able to be spayed.\nFern is either all out sleeping and cuddling or all out playing. She greets us with full-body wags in the mornings and when we come home. Fern loves belly rubs! She enjoys walks and does very well on a leash. She also loves to lie in the sun in the backyard. She plays with plush toys and chews hard bones. Fern loves to play \u201ctag\u201d in the yard. She runs around and then stops. I have to tag her and then she\u2019ll start running again. She is so much fun!\nFern is not food aggressive and is very gentle taking treats. She can be very lazy, sleeping in any empty space - couch, bed, table, etc. And she\u2019s quite stubborn if you try to get her to move before she\u2019s ready!\nFern quickly learned her way around our small home. She knows where to find the water bowl, and she will go to the back door and bark when she needs to go out. She will whine a little bit if she can\u2019t find you - and then comes right to you when you call her name.\nI can\u2019t imagine any family where Fern would not be a good fit. She is so perfect and will be a joy to the family who adopts her!\nBDRA has voted against the use of electrical fencing effective immediately.",

            "description": "With the looks that rival those of Justin Timberlake or Justin Bieber, depending on your generation, this young Rottweiler mix will be turning heads on walks around the neighborhood! About 2 years old, Justin is a long and lean 54 lbs with some filling out to do. He's an energetic and athletic guy who is having a blast playing with his doggy pals on the farm and has never met a person he didn't like. He may do best with older kids, as he is still in need of some more formal training and not fully aware of his size, but is eager to learn and eager to please. We've quickly fallen head over heels for his handsome boy and we are sure you will too! Be sure to hurry and submit your adoption request to meet Justin, because this chart-topper surely won't be on the farm long!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

            "description": "Our Angel is a 10lb, 13 year old pomeranian who is looking for her perfect forever home! She is an absolute darling who insists on being loved on every moment! She is a great lap dog and also walks well on a leash. Angel is likely deaf and has had chronic ear infections her whole life. She also has kidney disease and a history of UTIs, but is doing well with prescription food and a supplement. Her latest bloodwork showed an improvement in her kidneys, indicating that a good diet and proper care has helped her a lot! She gets along with other dogs and would be fine with cats and kids as well, but she does have a grumpy streak when you approach her if she is already in a lap and for this reason we urge caution if you have children in your home. Angel is another senior who deserves a happy life and has years of love to give!\n\nPlease fill out an application and we will call you once approved to set up a meet and greet. If you have any questions, email director@canineestates.com or call 727-412-0558",

He will stop long enough to give a few kisses and then off he goes, tail wagging and exploring. Tamale gets along with everyone and is adorable. He loves to burrow under blankets. Tamale is visually impaired and hard of hearing but nothing stops this little guy from enjoying life. We are guessing Tamale is about 10-12 years old and still very spunky! If you would like to give this little guy a second chance at life, please apply at polkadogz.org. Please note: Before applying all pets must be spayed/neutered and up to date on vaccinations and heartworm prevention. Heartworm prevention is an absolute requirement for adoption from Polka Dogz. We only adopt in the state of Florida and all adoption fees go to help all the pets in our rescue, many of which need extensive medical care. Thank you for caring for the greater good.\n\nTamale is about 8 lbs and super sweet! Adoption fee: $200",

She does well with the german shepherd and golden doodle currently in her foster home and they are working on crate training and potty training. Luna has a lot of energy during the day and loves to snuggle on the couch at night. She will be traveling to the PNW on 2/06 and arriving on 2/08. More pictures will be uploaded soon! \n\n \n\nShe is up to date on vaccines according to age, has received proper deworming, and comes with additional dewormer if needed. This pet is microchipped, spayed/neutered, comes with 2-6 months of Heartworm preventative or a proheart6 injection, and one month free trial of pet insurance if registered by adopter with insurance company. All animals receive a health certificate (stating that a licensed veterinarian saw the pet and deemed it healthy for travel, but is not a promise of perfect health.) Our transports are USDA certified and the cost of transport is included in adoption fee!\n\nShe is currently being fostered in Houston, TX but will be traveling to the PNW on 2/06 arriving on 2/08\n\n \n\nPlease inquire by submitting an application to \n\nhttps://petstablished.com/adoption_form/30279/generic\n\nEmail sarah@threelittlepittiesrescue.org for any additional questions\n\nPlease go to our website to see more about our rescue and what we do! We are very proud of our hard work in saving as many animals as we can, giving them what they need, and matching them with the right families.",

He appears to be playful with other dogs, but is too much of a wild child to be in a home with children.\n\nWhile he has a lot of love to give, he is looking for someone who will give him the physical and mental exercise he requires! We believe this young boy was not provided enough structure during puppyhood, so he is now being taught how to make good choices for the first time.\n\nAlthough Sarge makes huge leaps and bounds on his training journey every day, his adopters will need to understand that continued training (provided by the rescue) will be needed for his transition. \n\nOnce Sarge finds his forever family that is ready and willing for a project pup to help grow, we KNOW he will make a great companion to adventure with, play with, and just hang out with! \n\nTo discuss Sarge further please send us an email at adopt@crcpa.org.

            "description": "Exuberant, play driven, and headstrong, Buck has endless energy. Buck is always on the go, and is looking for someone to match his outgoing personality and high scale spirit.\n\nAs well as high energy, Buck also has high anxiety; especially in relation to being alone. Buck would like nothing more in the world then to find a human to be with all of the time (he is what some would call a stage-5 clinger). If you are in reach, he is the happiest of boys!\n\nSome of Bucks favorite activities are playing fetch, going for walks, mental stimulation games, car rides, and more fetch. While Buck has good leash manners, he does walk with a purpose and generally is a stride ahead of you. He can be reactive when first meeting other dogs, and becomes a strong puller when passing others out in the world.\n\nIn regards to meeting other dogs in general, Buck has a very large bark which can be off-putting to new dogs (and some people). With positive redirection he quiets himself down, and with time he can learn to be friends with dogs of his size. He is not suggested to be with small dogs or cats. \n\nBucks ideal home would be with an experienced and active owner, who is home majority of the time and can work with his separation anxiety. Due to his ample energy and uncoordinated body/mouth, he is not suited for a home with small children. He would also benefit from a large yard with lots of space to run and play.\n\nBuck came into care with bladder stones, and is required to be on a prescription urinary diet to keep them from reoccurring. This will be a life long diet.\n\nWe anticipate a large number of inquiries for Buck. We ask for patience in waiting for a response, as we will be working diligently to find the best match for him and only reaching out to successful candidates.

We think that hes a sweet mix of black mouth cur and doxie, but we know for sure that he is the perfect mix of loving pupper for some lucky family! Paul has done excellently with his beginning potty training lessons at his foster home, and we think he is super smart and will be highly trainable. He would do great with other dog friends and even cats! Any kiddos in the home should be ten years or older as he is just a little pup and as such is mouthy and playful. . Paul is a sweet snuggly boy, anxious to find his forever home. Are you the one he has been waiting for? If so appply to adopt him at the following link! \n\nNote: No inquiries please as we are fully volunteer staffed and have only enough woman power to staff completed applications. \n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/60136667457159",

            "description": "Kylie is a very pretty 2 \u00bd -to- 3 year old pup who looks like a Rhodesian Ridgeback/ Hound Dog/ maybe Labrador blend.  I just can\u2019t quite figure her out, but she\u2019s a lovely, sweet, amusing girl.\n\nAn on-line \u201cDNA test\u201d \u2013 based more on appearances than actual DNA \u2013 shows her to be 73% Rhodesian Ridgeback.\n\nKylie is medium sized \u2013 she weighs maybe 40 \u2013 45 pounds full grown.\n\nShe\u2019s also very smart, and I am particularly partial to smart dogs, and Kylie fits the bill to a \u201cT.\u201d\n\nKylie is very sweet and tolerant.  When I first fostered her, she seemed afraid of men, but now she gets along well with both men and women.  She would probably be best with teenagers, instead of little kids, just because she is rather active.\n\nShe comes when she is called and gets along great with my other foster dogs. Although she is a big strong hound, she doesn\u2019t need to be the dominant dog and fits right in the middle of the group. \n\nKylie never wanders or digs in the yard. In fact, when she is in the front yard (which isn\u2019t fenced), she just hangs out and is wonderful well-behaved. She is just a happy-go-lucky girl.\n\nShe is good-natured and smart, but she could use some basic training. \n\nI think Kylie would make a perfect family buddy for a very active family \u2013 she is loving, a great size, active, and fun to be with.\n\nKylie is quiet, so she won\u2019t disturb your neighbors at all.\n\nKylie is completely house trained and crate trained.\n\nAlthough she is wonderfully gentle and tolerant, a girl like Kylie will keep you and your children safe.  \n\nIn fact, Kylie is the sort of pup you can walk or hike with late at night in a secluded area and feel safe \u2013 not because she is the tiniest bit mean or nasty, but because she just looks protective!\n\nAt the moment, this funny girl is curled up on the cool floor beside my desk as I type this--she is such a mellow sweetheart.\n\nThere is something simply lovable about Kylie \u2013 maybe it is the warm expression on her face or maybe it is how her eyes look right into yours with love \u2013 she seems like a special rescue to me.\n\nShe is active, healthy, and young, but not at all hyper. She can play like a puppy, and she LOVES her toys!\n\nKylie has a lovely, sweet face, and big soft brown eyes.  \n\nOf course, Kylie is spayed, up to date on all her shots, and ready for her forever home.\n\nI am a firm believer in allowing people who are interested in adopting one of my rascals to have a sleepover (which can be more than one day), so you might want to take this big lug home to see how you, your family, your other pets, and Kylie all adapt to one another.  \n\nTo meet this great pupper and the rest of our other great foster doggies, please email crittersandrascals@gmail.com                                  (pls no calls or texts)\n",

            "description": "Meet  Peppy  ~\n\nMy name is Peppy and I am a 6 year old Chihuahua from South Carolina.  I weigh roughly  7 lbs.\n\nI am a very sweet guy for sure! I love being held or just sitting on a lap. Barking is not big on my priority list so I am pretty quiet. I am great in the crate and don't mind it a bit!\nBut big dogs beware! I may be small but I am not stupid! I will not hesitate to strike at you like a snake, if you come too close!\n\nWith my adorable looks, and unbridled loyalty, I will always be there for you through thick and thin. I will never judge you, or turn my back on you. Every single day, you will look at me and you will know that you are loved unconditionally. I will never betray you or hurt you, and I will grow old by your side.\n\n******IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ ALL THE GREAT INFO BELOW******\n\n***Please don't apply unless you are very serious about adopting, and are ready to move forward with the adoption process. We are super busy and make a great effort to respond back to EVERYONE ASAP! WHEN WE TAKE THE TIME TO PROCESS AN APPLICATION AND RESPOND BACK TO THE APPLICANT JUST TO BE EITHER IGNORED OR BE TOLD THEY CANNOT COME FOR SEVERAL DAYS, MORE TIME IS WASTED~PLEASE HAVE MORE RESPECT THAN THAT!\n\nPLEASE read our website's ADOPTION PROCESS PAGE prior to submitting an adoption application. www.apupspizzazzrescue.com/adoption-process \nADOPTION APPLICATION: www.apupspizzazzrescue.com/adoption-application \n\nABOUT OUR RESCUE DOGS: \n All of our dogs are located in Connecticut, are spayed or neutered, up to date on vaccines, microchipped, have been given deworming medications, and have had CT State health checks, & go home with a leash, collar, & packet of medical paperwork. \n\nBREED IDENTIFICATION:\nPlease understand that many rescue dogs are mixes of multiple breeds. Petfinder allows us to choose up to two breeds per dog. While the shelters and our rescue do our best in accurately identifying breeds, breed identification is not guaranteed. If there is a certain breed that you do not want, it is very important that you share this with our rescue when applying. When adopting a puppy, breed uncertainty plays a big part in the size/look of the dog as an adult. Please know that any puppy can be a wonderful dog, regardless of preconceived notions of certain breeds, but it is very important that the adopter has the dedication and patience to raise the puppy with boundaries, consistency, structure, & love. The more effort you give towards training & time you allow for exercise, your puppy will grow to be a HUGE source of UNCONDITIONAL LOVE, TOTAL LOYALTY, HAPPINESS, COMFORT & COMPANIONSHIP!\n\nABOUT OUR RESCUE:\nWe are a small rescue run by volunteers & focused on finding the right match for both our dogs & for you. If you are interested in adopting through our rescue, you first will need to complete an adoption application & be approved as a potential adopter before meeting any of our pups. No need to be intimidated by our application as it allows us to get to know you & your lifestyle. Of course, the more you can share the better! Please also note, while a fenced yard is fantastic, it is not required by our rescue, however, it may be required for a certain dog occasionally.  Once adoption applicants are approved to become potential adopters, we offer private appointments where you can meet one or several dogs at the discretion of the rescue. We offer a unique & pleasant experience focused on finding the perfect match. It is extremely important to us that everyone is treated with respect & that NO ONE IS LEFT HANGING. WE WILL GET BACK TO YOU WITHIN 2 TO 3 DAYS of application submission. If there is a dog you are eager to meet, please  TEXT US DIRECTLY at 203-241-2351 so that we can check the status of your application and move it forward immediately. We look forward to hearing from you and helping you find your new best friend.\n\n*All adult dogs can be cat tested by request.\n\nHOME/RENTER INSURANCE:\nSOME PROVIDERS HAVE VERY STRICT POLICIES REGARDING WHICH TYPE OF DOG BREEDS ARE ALLOWED UNDER THEIR COVERAGE. STATE FARM WAS SUGGESTED TO US AS THEY DO NOT PUNISH, DROP, NOR REFUSE YOU DUE TO DOG BREED SHOULD YOU RUN INTO ISSUES WITH YOUR CURRENT PROVIDER.",

I hope to burn off so much energy playing, that we can cuddle at night! Training is the best way to help me become the best pup out there, it helps that I am so food motivated too! I would love to meet your dogs here at the shelter first, as I can be a little picky of friends! Do I sound like the pur-fect one for you?\n\nMake an appointment to meet me at AAWL's Main Shelter!\n\nhttps://aawl.org/content/appointment-based-adoptions\n\nAAWL recommends I live with humans ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AGE or older.\nAAWL says I am a WEEKEND ATHLETE, meaning I need regular exercise.\nAAWL says I am TOLERANT of dogs.

I am hoping to find a calm and mellow home, and wouldn't mind a furry friend or two, to show me the ropes. I love to go on light walks in the mornings and evenings to keep me happy and healthy! Afterwards, if you wanted to binge watch movies and TV, I'll be happy to join you! I promise to give a lifetime of love and devotion to the family who cherishes me. Could that be you?\n\nMake an appointment to meet me at AAWL's Main Shelter!\n\nhttps://aawl.org/content/appointment-based-adoptions\n\nAAWL recommends I live with humans ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AGE and older.\nAAWL says I am TOLERANT of other dogs. Please bring your dogs to the shelter to meet me.\nAAWL says I am a NOW AND THEN exercise.\nAAWL does not know if I can live with cats at this time.\n\nI'm Beemer's Buddy!

IF THEY ARE POSTED, THEY ARE AVAILABLE \u2014 IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN SETTING UP A MEET AND GREET, SUBMIT AN APPLICATION THECANTUFOUNDATION.ORG ]\n\nHi! My name is Vicky! I am an 8 month, female, beagle mix weighing in at a about 20 pounds! I am here because the wonderful people at The Cantu Foundation found and saved me from the streets, they found me tied up! I am house trained and working on my leash manners and I\u2019m ready to come home with you. I just know we can be best friends!\n\u00a0\nI am lovable, playful and curious and I love my toys! I am great with other dogs at my foster home and I\u2019m good with kids and cats! I don\u2019t want any fur siblings that are too small like bunnies or hamsters because I like to chase them. Once I get all my puppy energy out, I love naps and cuddling! I also love to watch out the window and see what\u2019s happening out in the world from the house or the car. I\u2019d love a new family that likes to be outside with me!\n\u00a0\nI hope to go to a new home with a family that is ready to grow with me and help train me to be a good doggie in the years to come. I can go to a home with dog and human siblings and love to be active! I love everyone so far and adjust well to my surroundings after a short time! My adoption fee is $500 and that includes spaying/neutering and vetting care. If you want to take me home, please fill out the form on the website here http://www.thecantufoundation.org/adopt.html\u00a0\n",

If you have a dog you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application before sending us emails. When your application has been processed, you will receive an email from us with further instructions on how to adopt. You do not need a new application for every dog that you are interested in adopting. \n\nAt MAMCO we understand that in order to continue rescuing moms and babies, we must stretch our finances as far as we are able. For this reason we use variable adoption pricing. By assigning higher adoption fees to high demand moms and puppies, we are able to rescue more families in need.The money raised through these adoptions acts as a benefactor to moms and puppies in our care who require expensive veterinary treatments, have behavioral issues, or need more time to find a home. We often reduce the adoption fees on these harder-to-place moms and puppies to help them find forever families. Adoption fees vary, but all include spay or neuter, microchip, up to date vaccinations and deworming, rabies vaccine at the time of spay or neuter, and 30 days of pet insurance. We also cover hernia repair and cherry eye repair at the time of spay or neuter. Applications can be filled out at mamcorescue.org.",

We are thrilled that so many people want to adopt right now, but we are not equipped to handle the large number of calls, applications, and email inquiries we are receiving. We are no longer answering phone calls and are doing all communications with adopters via email. If you have a dog you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application before sending us emails. When your application has been processed, you will receive an email from us with further instructions on how to adopt. You do not need a new application for every dog that you are interested in adopting. \n\nAt MAMCO we understand that in order to continue rescuing moms and babies, we must stretch our finances as far as we are able. For this reason we use variable adoption pricing. By assigning higher adoption fees to high demand moms and puppies, we are able to rescue more families in need.The money raised through these adoptions acts as a benefactor to moms and puppies in our care who require expensive veterinary treatments, have behavioral issues, or need more time to find a home. We often reduce the adoption fees on these harder-to-place moms and puppies to help them find forever families. Adoption fees vary, but all include spay or neuter, microchip, up to date vaccinations and deworming, rabies vaccine at the time of spay or neuter, and 30 days of pet insurance. We also cover hernia repair and cherry eye repair at the time of spay or neuter. Applications can be filled out at mamcorescue.org.",

We are no longer answering phone calls and are doing all communications with adopters via email. If you have a dog you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application before sending us emails. When your application has been processed, you will receive an email from us with further instructions on how to adopt. You do not need a new application for every dog that you are interested in adopting. \n\nAt MAMCO we understand that in order to continue rescuing moms and babies, we must stretch our finances as far as we are able. For this reason we use variable adoption pricing. By assigning higher adoption fees to high demand moms and puppies, we are able to rescue more families in need.The money raised through these adoptions acts as a benefactor to moms and puppies in our care who require expensive veterinary treatments, have behavioral issues, or need more time to find a home. We often reduce the adoption fees on these harder-to-place moms and puppies to help them find forever families. Adoption fees vary, but all include spay or neuter, microchip, up to date vaccinations and deworming, rabies vaccine at the time of spay or neuter, and 30 days of pet insurance.

We are thrilled that so many people want to adopt right now, but we are not equipped to handle the large number of calls, applications, and email inquiries we are receiving. We are no longer answering phone calls and are doing all communications with adopters via email. If you have a dog you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application before sending us emails. When your application has been processed, you will receive an email from us with further instructions on how to adopt. You do not need a new application for every dog that you are interested in adopting. \n\nAt MAMCO we understand that in order to continue rescuing moms and babies, we must stretch our finances as far as we are able. For this reason we use variable adoption pricing. By assigning higher adoption fees to high demand moms and puppies, we are able to rescue more families in need.The money raised through these adoptions acts as a benefactor to moms and puppies in our care who require expensive veterinary treatments, have behavioral issues, or need more time to find a home. We often reduce the adoption fees on these harder-to-place moms and puppies to help them find forever families. Adoption fees vary, but all include spay or neuter, microchip, up to date vaccinations and deworming, rabies vaccine at the time of spay or neuter, and 30 days of pet insurance. We also cover hernia repair and cherry eye repair at the time of spay or neuter. Applications can be filled out at mamcorescue.org.",

For this reason we use variable adoption pricing. By assigning higher adoption fees to high demand moms and puppies, we are able to rescue more families in need.The money raised through these adoptions acts as a benefactor to moms and puppies in our care who require expensive veterinary treatments, have behavioral issues, or need more time to find a home. We often reduce the adoption fees on these harder-to-place moms and puppies to help them find forever families. Adoption fees vary, but all include spay or neuter, microchip, up to date vaccinations and deworming, rabies vaccine at the time of spay or neuter, and 30 days of pet insurance. We also cover hernia repair and cherry eye repair at the time of spay or neuter. Applications can be filled out at mamcorescue.org.",

We are thrilled that so many people want to adopt right now, but we are not equipped to handle the large number of calls, applications, and email inquiries we are receiving. We are no longer answering phone calls and are doing all communications with adopters via email. If you have a dog you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application before sending us emails. When your application has been processed, you will receive an email from us with further instructions on how to adopt. You do not need a new application for every dog that you are interested in adopting. \n\nAt MAMCO we understand that in order to continue rescuing moms and babies, we must stretch our finances as far as we are able. For this reason we use variable adoption pricing. By assigning higher adoption fees to high demand moms and puppies, we are able to rescue more families in need.The money raised through these adoptions acts as a benefactor to moms and puppies in our care who require expensive veterinary treatments, have behavioral issues, or need more time to find a home. We often reduce the adoption fees on these harder-to-place moms and puppies to help them find forever families. Adoption fees vary, but all include spay or neuter, microchip, up to date vaccinations and deworming, rabies vaccine at the time of spay or neuter, and 30 days of pet insurance. We also cover hernia repair and cherry eye repair at the time of spay or neuter. Applications can be filled out at mamcorescue.org.",

We are thrilled that so many people want to adopt right now, but we are not equipped to handle the large number of calls, applications, and email inquiries we are receiving. We are no longer answering phone calls and are doing all communications with adopters via email. If you have a dog you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application before sending us emails. When your application has been processed, you will receive an email from us with further instructions on how to adopt. You do not need a new application for every dog that you are interested in adopting. \n\nAt MAMCO we understand that in order to continue rescuing moms and babies, we must stretch our finances as far as we are able. For this reason we use variable adoption pricing. By assigning higher adoption fees to high demand moms and puppies, we are able to rescue more families in need.The money raised through these adoptions acts as a benefactor to moms and puppies in our care who require expensive veterinary treatments, have behavioral issues, or need more time to find a home. We often reduce the adoption fees on these harder-to-place moms and puppies to help them find forever families. Adoption fees vary, but all include spay or neuter, microchip, up to date vaccinations and deworming, rabies vaccine at the time of spay or neuter, and 30 days of pet insurance. We also cover hernia repair and cherry eye repair at the time of spay or neuter. Applications can be filled out at mamcorescue.org.",

We are thrilled that so many people want to adopt right now, but we are not equipped to handle the large number of calls, applications, and email inquiries we are receiving. We are no longer answering phone calls and are doing all communications with adopters via email. If you have a dog you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application before sending us emails. When your application has been processed, you will receive an email from us with further instructions on how to adopt. You do not need a new application for every dog that you are interested in adopting. \n\nAt MAMCO we understand that in order to continue rescuing moms and babies, we must stretch our finances as far as we are able. For this reason we use variable adoption pricing. By assigning higher adoption fees to high demand moms and puppies, we are able to rescue more families in need.The money raised through these adoptions acts as a benefactor to moms and puppies in our care who require expensive veterinary treatments, have behavioral issues, or need more time to find a home. We often reduce the adoption fees on these harder-to-place moms and puppies to help them find forever families. Adoption fees vary, but all include spay or neuter, microchip, up to date vaccinations and deworming, rabies vaccine at the time of spay or neuter, and 30 days of pet insurance. We also cover hernia repair and cherry eye repair at the time of spay or neuter. Applications can be filled out at mamcorescue.org.",

            "description": "*Due to concerns surrounding COVID-19, we have reformatted the way that we do adoptions in order to follow social distancing protocols. We are thrilled that so many people want to adopt right now, but we are not equipped to handle the large number of calls, applications, and email inquiries we are receiving. We are no longer answering phone calls and are doing all communications with adopters via email. If you have a dog you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application before sending us emails. When your application has been processed, you will receive an email from us with further instructions on how to adopt. You do not need a new application for every dog that you are interested in adopting. \n\nAt MAMCO we understand that in order to continue rescuing moms and babies, we must stretch our finances as far as we are able. For this reason we use variable adoption pricing. By assigning higher adoption fees to high demand moms and puppies, we are able to rescue more families in need.The money raised through these adoptions acts as a benefactor to moms and puppies in our care who require expensive veterinary treatments, have behavioral issues, or need more time to find a home. We often reduce the adoption fees on these harder-to-place moms and puppies to help them find forever families. Adoption fees vary, but all include spay or neuter, microchip, up to date vaccinations and deworming, rabies vaccine at the time of spay or neuter, and 30 days of pet insurance. We also cover hernia repair and cherry eye repair at the time of spay or neuter. Applications can be filled out at mamcorescue.org.",

When she is afraid, she will hide, but if you are patient, her curiosity gets the best of her as she will come out to see what's going on. Pikachu can be unsure of humans at first but is very comfortable following and trying to play with other dogs. Once she builds trust with her new family, she will follow you and try to snuggle up next to you on the couch. She is very good at going potty outside but still has a few accidents here and there. She doesn't quite understand leashes yet so a fenced yard is ideal. Pikachu will be a loyal companion and would do best in a household with previous experience with dogs.\n\nApproved Applicants may make the adoption fee payment by clicking donate above. Partial adoption fees will not hold a dog.\n\nIf upon meeting the dog of your choosing at an adoption event you find that you aren't a good match, your deposit will be refunded minus a 10% administration fee.\n\nIn-person adoptions will begin on the date of a dog's first event provided they are still available. Dogs not adopted during their first event will attend additional events thereafter until adopted. \n\nAn adoption application online is required prior to viewing our dogs. Adoption fees include vaccines up until time of adoption, microchip, spay/neuter and 1st 30 days of free Pet insurance. We are not affiliated with Pet First pet insurance. (you have to sign up for the insurance or it will not go into effect). Adopters can go to our vet for medical issues that may arise in 1st 3 days of adoption. \n\nThe dogs in our care are fostered in Colorado, Texas, and New Mexico. While all dogs are picked up during our scheduled times, sometimes transport dates change due to unforeseen circumstances.",

Please do your research before applying. You MUST own your home to adopt her! Also you MUST have a large secure fenced yard, no underground fences. \n\nMeet Cookie! She was surrendered with two of her puppies. This girl is a little nervous when meeting new people but usually warms up quickly. Cookie is absolutely not leash trained and will need lots of work with that. Dont let this deter you she does great out in the fenced area. Cookie is great with other dogs and we do recommend she has a dog or two in her new home to help her adjust. We do not think she needs to be in a home with small children at this time, shes not aggressive we just want to feel the most comfortable. \n\nKeep up with us, our events, our adoptable animals, etc on our Facebook page under Mollys Mutts Animal Rescue!

We (as well as her owner) were concerned due to her breed (and because she wasnt spayed) as to where she could possibly end up. We reached out, and Havanas owner agreed she would be better off in rescue. \n\nHavana is amazing dog. She has been with us for a little over a month now while we get all her vetting done (will be done February 10) and we have fallen in love with her sweet personality. She is a super sweet, loving and well-behaved pitty princess. \n\nWe were told Havana does well with other dogs; and we know she lived with multiple cats and kids. She LOVES to be outside (but does require an inside home). \n\nShes a mid sized girl. Crate trained, potty trained, and your all around perfect girl. \n\nIf interested in Havana please contact us! \n\n To Contact Us \n TEXT Cilena at 308-249-4308\n Message us through our website http://www.highplainspaw.org\n Message the Facebook Page at https://www.facebook.com/HighPlainsPAW\n Fill out our Adoption Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/adoption-application\n Email us at highplainspaw@gmail.com\n\n $200.00 Adoption Fee \n(Which is considered a non refundable donation and being we are a 501c3 organization it is tax deductible. The fee itself is not negotiable, our vets don't negotiate and thus neither do we).\n\n WE DO NOT HAVE A FACILITY ALL OUR DOGS ARE LOCATED IN FOSTER HOMES. This means there is no place for you to go in person to view our dogs. We ask that an application be filled out and we will go from there!\n\n Posted by Cilena",

She had a large seroma removed and a broken pelvis, but is doing well!! Very sweet and cuddly, mostly housetrained, and knows basic commands. Good with larger dogs but not great with small dogs or cats. Best in a home with children 12 or older. Lots of goofiness fitting a puppy and currently 45 pounds, so will be large. Her $200 adoption fee covers her spay, vaccines, deworming medication, heartworm and flea/tick preventatives and microchip registration. https://gfrpets.org/apply/adoptdog/",

Please understand that we cannot hold any pets.

Meet this coming Monday Feb 1 2021 at the shelter.\n\nThis is a puppy with puppy behavior and will need continued work on house training!\n\nIf you have ANY QUESTIONS or are truly interested in adopting any animal from PAW Animal Shelter Please, fillout an adoption application FIRST! WE are a high intake No Kill Shelter ran by a staff of 4 and do not always have time to answer every question asked by so many. If you are a good fit for the animal you are interested in -we will call to speak with you, If we feel you are not a good fit , we will contact you about other pets that may be a good fit for your home. Many people are losing the opportunity to adopt the animal they want because they fail to put in an application and the pet was adopted before we could answer your email. .If you have applied for an animal in our facility and have not received a response within 7 days, PLEASE call or contact us again. Though we do our best in trying to answer all emails in a timely manner, sometimes things get away from us, get lost or misplaced. It is never our intention to ignore a request about an adoptable animal in our facility.\n\nSandy Brown, Director, PAW Animal Shelter\n\n319-372-2274",

            "description": "Let's all give a little shout-out for seniors with style! Max is a 14-year old Pomapoo (Pomaranian/Toy Poodle mix) that has a story or two to tell... This dreamboat has clearly gotten better with age and would love a new home where he can relax in his golden years! Max has had a lot of time to develop friendly social skills so he gets along with everyone - strangers, men, women, and children. He gets on well with small dogs (no big boys, please!) and cats too! I'm not sure if you can tell from the photo, but this this fella still has some pep in his step! Calm but curious, this tiny 10 lb. senior will take off faster than you might imagine, so he'll need a fenced yard to help him stay safe. Max doesn't like to talk about this but, well, as an aging guy he experiences some \"senior moments\" having to do with potty time. We'll be learning more about this as he settles in with his foster family. In the meantime, keep in mind that belly bands are simple solutions for our older pets! They are an affordable, comfortable option to help keep things tidy around the house. This senior sweetheart has just joined his Muddy Paws foster family so we'll have updates coming soon! \n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Max is $300. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes. \n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver. \n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months. \n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

I need someone that knows my breed and is ok letting me get very attached to them. I don't like to be pet by other people when I am with my person. I've met lots of dog friends and love all of them. I like to go for walks, but prefer a harness rather than a collar. I love to snuggle under blankets and prefer to sleep with my people under the covers. I also don't mind my crate when humans leave. I know lots of human words, \"cookie\" is my favorite!!! I am about 6 years old and about 7lbs. I am now neutered, up to date with vaccines, microchipped and tested negative for heartworm. My adoption fee is $350.00. If you are interested in adopting me, please visit our website www.LHARinc.org go to Adopt and complete the dog adoption application.",

Bounding after you everytime you walk away, she has a fun and playful energy, but she equally enjoys spending time sleeping on the couch between play sessions. Elle would do best in a home with a fenced yard, where someone is with her always or often, and where she has a doggy friend. She is mostly housebroken, but sometimes has the occassional accident. Elle is spayed, current on vaccines, and microchipped and her adoption fee is $400.\n\nTo meet our snugglebug, Elle, please fill out an adoption application located on our website at www.pawprinthearts.com.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: PPH does not adopt to homes farther than a 1 hour drive from Tampa, FL.",

The mom nearly died giving birth to puppies that were too big for her little body but luckily she got to the vet in time for an emergency C-section (and SPAY). Although some of the puppies sadly didn't make it, we are grateful that these, and their mother (mom is still in owner's care), survived.\n\nThese babies have a ton of personality and spunk and they're learning so much in their foster home. They are all outgoing and playful and would do well with an active family who will keep them busy and learning new things. They will likely be medium sized when fully grown.\n\n$195 Adoption Fee. \n\nA $10.00 non-refundable application fee is required to submit your adoption application and will be deducted from your adoption fee if you adopt.\n\nAll puppies are dewormed, started on heartworm and flea prevention, and microchipped.\n\nAll puppies will be adopted with current, age appropriate vaccines, given by Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue. Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue will provide their puppy series DAPP vaccines, given at 8, 12, and 16 weeks of age.\n\nPuppy adopters will be will be required to bring the puppy back to Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue to receive any remaining puppy vaccines after adoption. \n\nPuppy adopters will also be required to bring the puppy to our vet for their spay/neuter surgery after they receive their 16 week vaccination. \n\nThe spay/neuter and puppy vaccines are included with the puppy adoption fee.\n\nWe have a strict one hour puppy adoption radius, puppy adopters must be within one hour of Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue.

She really likes having a place to do her zoomies, but also a cozy spot to snuggle afterwards. \n\nShe walks well on a leash and is totally house trained. Juliana aka JuJu is in foster with boys over 10 and loves to play and snuggle with them. She is also in foster with two resident dogs and getting along great. She is beyond sweet and an incredible pup!\n\nPlease visit our website directly to apply. Once we review applications, we will contact you for a video interview if your household is a good fit.

            "description": "Hi, my name is Chris and I\u2019m a 5 year old chocolate/Chesapeake Lab mix (I think)! I came to SCLRR after my owner passed right around Christmas, but I persevered and found a really nice foster family to help me get in tip-top shape. Since being rescued, I have had a few lumps removed, but the vets said they turned out not to be the bad kind. Yay! I also lost a couple pounds \u2013 but I\u2019m still a big boy weighing in around 110 pounds.\n\nAs I mentioned, I go by Chris and if you\u2019re lucky, I\u2019ll respond to Christopher. I have a decent amount of energy and like to go on 2-3 walks a day (20-30 min each). But I\u2019ll settle for 2 short walks\u2026as long as I get out to explore, I\u2019m happy. I\u2019m working on not tugging so much on the leash and the pinch collar really helps with that! I can sit and stay when asked, but only when I\u2019m really paying attention. I\u2019m a friendly guy and love people (and my foster dog brother too). I might do well with other dogs, but it\u2019s best to meet first just in case.\n\nI\u2019m not a fan of cats or other animals \u2013 they distract me from listening because I just want to catch them! I\u2019d do well with teenagers, but I\u2019ve never been around little kids. Plus I\u2019m a big guy who might knock them over. I\u2019m not food driven and don\u2019t beg at meal times. I\u2019m house broken and know how to use a doggy door.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t make a good guard dog because I don\u2019t really bark when people ring the doorbell. And MOST importantly, I\u2019m very affectionate and don\u2019t know anything about personal space. I love snuggling in bed with my people and following them around wherever they go!",

She's about 9 years old and blind from her injuries (we'll spare you the details here about the extent of what happened), and will probably need some help through the rest of her life, but will be a wonderful lady to call your own once she fully recovers.",

This sweet boy has spent his entire life on a chain tied to a tree in a backyard in rural North Carolina. After some convincing, the owners agreed to surrender him to our rescue and now this two-year-old, 65 lb. pittie is up in Connecticut ready to find his happily furever after! \n\nBeing an outdoor dog his whole life, Kane's finally adjusting to life inside a cozy foster home. Like most pit bulls, this guy LOVES love! He is as affectionate as can be and will jump up and give you a hug, while gently licking your hand. He will look up at you with his golden brown eyes and you can just feel the love he has to give. Kane knows he's finally safe and will thank you for years to come. In addition to being a cuddler, he loves a game of fetch and running around the yard. He is an energetic boy who enjoys adventures, chewing on a kong with peanut butter, belly rubs, and laying in the sun!\n\nSince he has never lived as a normal dog, he would benefit from some training classes as he is pulls on leash and jumps when excited. Kane's currently in a home with children so we believe he'll be fine with kids 8+ as long as they're dog savvy. He would do best in a home with no other dogs as he's still learning how to interact and play. You MUST have a fenced yard to be considered for his adoption. Dog exprerience highly preferred.\n\nKane's adoption fee is $350 and he is up to date on vaccines, microchipped, heartworm negative, and neutered. If you are interested in adopting this sweetheart of a dog, please complete the application at form.jotform.com/200883908893166. For questions, please email info@happilyfureverafter.org.",

He loves belly rubs and kisses BUT!..\nJackson is a 9month old Shih Tzu mix. He weighs 16 pounds. He is fully potty trained. We have had issues with Jackson being aggressive particularly with women. However he has been in training and has come a long way. In order to keep his good behavior going, he will need an active owner who will continue to socialize him, to keep him mentally stimulated. He will also need a canine buddy and a fenced yard for lots of puppy play. If you are interested in Jackson, please visit our website and complete an application.\nwww.misfitsdogrescue.org\nHis adoption fee is $275\n2/2/21 4:51 PM",

Our veterinary partner estimates that Mindy is 3 months old at the time of intake in January 2021. Mindy is good with people and other dogs. Mindy was left to die in the backyard of her home along with her Momma and brother when her owner moved away and just left them imprisoned in the yard without food, water or any chance of survival. Rather than die the slow death that was planned for her, Mindy was rescued by a neighbor and now she is ready to start the second chapter of her life. And the rest of Mindy's story will be happy! Mindy is a gorgeous pup who will light up her forever home. If you would like to star in the rest of Mindy's life, please apply online to adopt Mindy (TX) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

PLEASE READ MY BIO BELOW TO LEARN MORE ABOUT ME AND HOW TO APPLY TO ADOPT :)\n\nMeet the E pups:: 8 weeks old 2/6/21, 4 to 5 pounds, 3 males, 4 females, Boxer/Chihuahua/Dachshund mixes.\n\nAccepting Applications for adoption on 2/6/20.\n\nThese adorable little babies are lucky to be alive after the owner of their mom, who is a Chihuahua/Dachshund mix, didn't have her spayed and she bred with a boxer mix. The mom nearly died giving birth to puppies that were too big for her little body but luckily she got to the vet in time for an emergency C-section (and SPAY). Although some of the puppies sadly didn't make it, we are grateful that these, and their mother (mom is still in owner's care), survived.\n\nThese babies have a ton of personality and spunk and they're learning so much in their foster home. They are all outgoing and playful and would do well with an active family who will keep them busy and learning new things. They will likely be medium sized when fully grown.\n\n$195 Adoption Fee. \n\nA $10.00 non-refundable application fee is required to submit your adoption application and will be deducted from your adoption fee if you adopt.\n\nAll puppies are dewormed, started on heartworm and flea prevention, and microchipped.\n\nAll puppies will be adopted with current, age appropriate vaccines, given by Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue.

I've only been a Canadian for a short while, but I'm loving all this snow!\n\nI am calm, friendly and very well mannered. I love to chill out and snuggle next to you on the couch, especially if you are giving me belly rubs. I never get enough of those. Add a blanket to the mix and I'm in absolute heaven. My foster family knows how happy this makes me because I give them lots of kisses and stare lovingly with my big button eyes. I also love to sit by the window and watch the world go by. I especially love it when I see people and other dogs walk by. I get excited because I want to say hello. I'm ready for a new friend anytime! \n\nI love to chill, but I also have a playful side. I can never have enough toys. Once you get me going, I can be quite the silly dog. My foster family loves to horseplay and I get right in there. I've got a big heart and so I get along with kids and other dogs. Even though I haven't been around cats, my foster mom thinks I would be ok around them.\n\nCanadian winters don't bother me, so I'm ready for a walk anytime of the day. I get pretty excited about walks and will wait at the door patiently until you are ready. I am really good on my leash. My foster mom is so impressed because I just trot along without pulling. I'm always crossing my paws that I can meet other people and dogs on our walks. I am house trained and can sleep in my crate every night, however, I've convinced my foster parents to let me sleep in my bed next to them. They tell me it's because I'm such a good boy!\n\nI think I make a great companion and have lots of love to share with my forever family. I am currently being lovingly fostered in Woodbridge Ontario.",

            "description": "Ryder\nBreed: Australian Cattle Dog\nAge: 1.5 Years Old +/-; Neutered Male\nMedical: Up to Date on Vaccinations, Microchipped, Spayed, Wormed\nWeight: 40 pounds\nDogs: Yes\nCats: Unknown \nKids: 12 +\nCrate Trained : Yes\nHouse Trained : In Progress\nLocation: Maine\nRyder is a strikingly beautiful boy with a larger than life personality. This happy-go-lucky guy is up for anything. Need a sidekick for your motorcycle sidecar? He\u2019ll look great in goggles. Want a co pilot for your dream road trip? He can\u2019t wait to get his head in the wind. Hiking? Let\u2019s go! Is a kissy-face lovebug what you\u2019re looking for? He\u2019s all that and more. \u201cYes!\u201d I hear you saying. \u201cYes, I want a beautiful, kissy-face, Epic Adventure Dog.\u201d  Not so fast. Like many young Cattle Dogs, Ryder is mouthy. And when I say mouthy, I mean CATTLEGATOR. Your hands, feet, ears - they are all chew toys as far as Ryder is concerned. Sleeves, pant legs, mittens...it\u2019s all fair game to him. Because of his mouthiness, families with young children will not be considered for Ryder. \n\nLet\u2019s talk about dog friends. Ryder loves meeting new dogs, but the feeling may not be mutual. He is\u2026.over exuberant, to say the least. Until he\u2019s had lots of socialization practice, Ryder\u2019s dog friends will have to be extremely confident, tolerant, and fans of rough play. He does not have much of an off-switch when it comes to other dogs, but does rest quietly in his crate when he (or you) needs some down time. Ryder loves toys and has shown no toy or food guarding behavior with his foster siblings. \n\nRyder has not yet mastered house-training, but he\u2019s working on it and he is a fast learner.  He is still a few pounds underweight, which is good news, because he is very food motivated, and you won\u2019t have to count calories while doling out all those training treats. Time and lots of positive training will smooth away Ryder\u2019s rough spots, and polish what he is: an amazing, funny, sunny-natured boy with so much love to give. So\u2026.that adventure? He\u2019s ready when you are. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting Ryder please email sln2310@yahoo.com and request an application. Once your application has been received and reviewed, you will be contacted via email or phone by one of our volunteers. After your application is approved, the foster parent for the dog you have selected will contact you to answer any questions you may have and determine if that dog is a good match for your family. \nIf you have no particular dog in mind, we will be happy to keep your application on file and notify you if the right dog should come into rescue. Catahoula Rescue of New England is an all-volunteer group. Dogs in our program are fostered by volunteers. The foster homes care for our dogs as if they were their own. All dogs have received vaccinations appropriate to age and are spayed or neutered. \nRyder\u2019's adoption donation is $400 which includes Rabies, DHLPP, Bordetella, fecal test, heartworm test when appropriate and is on preventative, Spay/Neuter and microchip. We do not have a physical shelter, all of our dogs are fostered in individual foster homes across the New England and Canada",

Filling out an application does not obligate you to adopt, but merely begins the process. SEPR DOES adopt out of state!\n\nAdoption fees: All SEPR adoptions are $300 for adults and $400 for puppies 1 year and under.  This includes: adoption fee (spay/neuter, utd vaccinations, micro-chipping), microchip registration, Gentle Leader, and two tie downs for use in your home. \n\nSEPR requires all adopted dogs attend a training class with their adoptive family within 90 days of their adoption. If an adoptive family completes this training class, they will be refunded $100 of their adoption fee with proof of licensed certificate. SEPR even offers an obedience class called Train-A-Bull to alumni over 1 year of age on a seasonal basis.  These classes are currently free!\n\n*All other pets in the residence must be spayed or neutered and all pets up to date on vaccinations.\n\n*SEPR requires all applicants must be 21 years of age.\n\n*SEPR dogs are adopted to be inside the home, \u201cpart of the family\u201d dogs only.\n\n*Families with children 5 years of age and under wanting to adopt puppies will be reviewed on a case by case basis. Raising a puppy properly takes a lot of time, and we understand that in families with small children, time can be a limited commodity.",

PLEASE READ MY BIO BELOW TO LEARN MORE ABOUT ME AND HOW TO APPLY TO ADOPT :)\n\nMeet the E pups:: 8 weeks old 2/6/21, 4 to 5 pounds, 3 males, 4 females, Boxer/Chihuahua/Dachshund mixes.\n\nAccepting Applications for adoption on 2/6/20.\n\nThese adorable little babies are lucky to be alive after the owner of their mom, who is a Chihuahua/Dachshund mix, let her breed with a boxer mix and the mom nearly died giving birth to puppies that were too big for her little body. Luckily our rescue partners at Love of Paws acted quickly and got her into the vet for an emergency C-section (and SPAY). Although some of the puppies sadly didn't make it, we are grateful that these, and their mother (mom is still in owner's care), survived.\n\nThese babies have a ton of personality and spunk and they're learning so much in their foster home. They are all outgoing and playful and would do well with an active family who will keep them busy and learning new things. They will likely be medium sized when fully grown.\n\n$195 Adoption Fee. \n\nA $10.00 non-refundable application fee is required to submit your adoption application and will be deducted from your adoption fee if you adopt.\n\nAll puppies are dewormed, started on heartworm and flea prevention, and microchipped.\n\nAll puppies will be adopted with current, age appropriate vaccines, given by Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue. Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue will provide their puppy series DAPP vaccines, given at 8, 12, and 16 weeks of age.\n\nPuppy adopters will be will be required to bring the puppy back to Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue to receive any remaining puppy vaccines after adoption. \n\nPuppy adopters will also be required to bring the puppy to our vet for their spay/neuter surgery after they receive their 16 week vaccination. \n\nThe spay/neuter and puppy vaccines are included with the puppy adoption fee.\n\nWe have a strict one hour puppy adoption radius, puppy adopters must be within one hour of Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue. Please see our Adoption Radius tab on our website for more info, here:\nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/adoption-radius/\n\nAlong with other criteria evaluated in the adoption application, a Fenced Yard is required to adopt. \n\nPlease see our Fenced Yard Requirements tab on our website for more information, here:\nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/fenced-yard-requirements/\n\nTO CHECK AVAILABILITY of any of our adoptable animals, please go to our available pets tab, here: https://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/available-pets-for-adoption/\n\nAll pets listed here are updated regularly to reflect their availability.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR PEPPERMINT PIG ANIMAL RESCUE:\n\nBefore completing the application, please read our ADOPTION PROCESS tab on our website, here: \nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/how-our-adoptions-work/\n\nTo complete our easy online adoption application, please visit our website at PeppermintPigAnimalRescue.org.\n\nAdoption events are held every Saturday in our thrift store from 1:00pm to 4:00pm. Please complete your adoption application in advance so our volunteers have time to screen and contact potential adopters.\n\nIMPORTANT: All applications are reviewed in the order they are received and qualifications are based on best fit for each individual pet.

PLEASE READ MY BIO BELOW TO LEARN MORE ABOUT ME AND HOW TO APPLY TO ADOPT :)\n\nMeet the E pups:: 8 weeks old 2/6/21, 4 to 5 pounds, 3 males, 4 females, Boxer/Chihuahua/Dachshund mixes.\n\nAccepting Applications for adoption on 2/6/20.\n\nThese adorable little babies are lucky to be alive after the owner of their mom, who is a Chihuahua/Dachshund mix, let her breed with a boxer mix and the mom nearly died giving birth to puppies that were too big for her little body. Luckily our rescue partners at Love of Paws acted quickly and got her into the vet for an emergency C-section (and SPAY). Although some of the puppies sadly didn't make it, we are grateful that these, and their mother (mom is still in owner's care), survived.\n\nThese babies have a ton of personality and spunk and they're learning so much in their foster home. They are all outgoing and playful and would do well with an active family who will keep them busy and learning new things. They will likely be medium sized when fully grown.\n\n$195 Adoption Fee. \n\nA $10.00 non-refundable application fee is required to submit your adoption application and will be deducted from your adoption fee if you adopt.\n\nAll puppies are dewormed, started on heartworm and flea prevention, and microchipped.\n\nAll puppies will be adopted with current, age appropriate vaccines, given by Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue. Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue will provide their puppy series DAPP vaccines, given at 8, 12, and 16 weeks of age.\n\nPuppy adopters will be will be required to bring the puppy back to Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue to receive any remaining puppy vaccines after adoption. \n\nPuppy adopters will also be required to bring the puppy to our vet for their spay/neuter surgery after they receive their 16 week vaccination. \n\nThe spay/neuter and puppy vaccines are included with the puppy adoption fee.\n\nWe have a strict one hour puppy adoption radius, puppy adopters must be within one hour of Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue. Please see our Adoption Radius tab on our website for more info, here:\nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/adoption-radius/\n\nAlong with other criteria evaluated in the adoption application, a Fenced Yard is required to adopt. \n\nPlease see our Fenced Yard Requirements tab on our website for more information, here:\nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/fenced-yard-requirements/\n\nTO CHECK AVAILABILITY of any of our adoptable animals, please go to our available pets tab, here: https://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/available-pets-for-adoption/\n\nAll pets listed here are updated regularly to reflect their availability.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR PEPPERMINT PIG ANIMAL RESCUE:\n\nBefore completing the application, please read our ADOPTION PROCESS tab on our website, here: \nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/how-our-adoptions-work/\n\nTo complete our easy online adoption application, please visit our website at PeppermintPigAnimalRescue.org.\n\nAdoption events are held every Saturday in our thrift store from 1:00pm to 4:00pm. Please complete your adoption application in advance so our volunteers have time to screen and contact potential adopters.\n\nIMPORTANT: All applications are reviewed in the order they are received and qualifications are based on best fit for each individual pet.

            "description": "While he may be shy at first, Rodney warms up quickly with some scratches behind the ears and is undoubtedly the sweetest hound dog. He's young about 2 years of age, but has a mild temperament and a medium 46 lb build. Rodney can be a reserved guy around people he doesn't know, but gets along with every dog he meets, and doesn't even seem to take issue with the farm's chickens. He would love to find a home with a fenced yard, and maybe even a calm canine companion who can show him the ropes. With spring just around the corner, Rodney is ready to find a home where he can blossom. Just maybe that home is with you!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

Our veterinary partner estimates that Mark is 3 months old at the time of intake in January 2021. Mark is good with people and other dogs. Mark was abandoned with his Momma and sister in the backyard of their home when their owner moved out and just left them to fend for themselves with no food, no water, no way to survive. A guardian angel was watching over Mark, though, as a neighbor intervened and made sure that Mark and his family were rescued. And now Mark is a Rescue Dogs Rock NYC pup and his life will be happy. Mark is a happy, playful little guy who doesn't want to waste one single minute of the fantastic life we promised him. If you can open your heart and home to this adorable boy, please apply online to adopt Mark (TX) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

Not only is he eager to please his human, he also responds well to correction. Amos was originally found with another dog and brought to the shelter by our field officers. He quickly made even more friends with other four-legged pals onsite as well as kennel staff. Amos would likely make a great buddy for another pup or an active family ready for fun.

If a dog/puppy is still listed on Petfinder- we are still accepting applications for them**\n\nLola is in a foster home in Portland, OR\n\nLola, 10 years old, female, Labrador retriever mix, 46 lbs. Sweet senior Lola was owner surrendered to a high kill shelter in Houston Texas. Thankfully a foster reached out before this pup ended up on the euthanasia list. Lola transported to Oregon early January to settle in before finding her perfect home. \n\nLola was in a foster home with a lot of other dogs in Texas. Due to the other dog's behaviors and energy Lola did not interact with them. Her current foster home has no other animals. She has met some dogs through her fenced in yard. She has passed by other dogs on walks. She would need to meet any resident dog on a meet and greet to see how she interacts. \n\nLola really enjoys going on walks. Her foster has spent some time helping her to not pull on leash. She tends to get distracted and go off in various directions. Lola may be a \"senior\" but she has lots of energy! \n\nShe is housebroken and doesn't mind a crate. She loves to play with her toys- tug of war is her favorite. She is food motivated so this has greatly helped with training. \n\nHer current foster reports no separation anxiety. Lola has been okay alone in the house. She also rides great in the car. She is very affectionate and sweet. \n\nLola is an older dog with a fair amount of energy. We would love to find her a home that will keep her forever. She may need some training on leash, but appears to be very trainable. \nWe have no history with kids and recommend a home with kids 12 years and older. \n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess on age, breed and size when fully grown. We rarely know a dog's exact age nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. ***\n\nThe first step in our process is filling out an application. We will review your application as soon as we are able- there are two of us and we do the best that we can. We review applications on a first come first serve basis and look for the best fit/match for the dog and applicant.\n\nhttps://heartoftheunderdog.org/adoption-application",

She is currently 43 lbs. so we think she\u2019ll be smaller than an average female. Cady is housetrained, has had all shots, & is microchipped. She has been started on heartworm preventative. Cady has really attached quickly and strongly to her foster mom and we would expect her to do the same in her new home. She loves toys and will play fetch for quite some time!! She easily approaches new people and is very friendly. Cady does well with other dogs but tends to be a bit \u201cin your face\u201d and pushy. She definitely needs a playmate who can handle her energy. Once Cady has adjusted to her new home, she should have more socialization opportunities and be enrolled in some basic obedience training classes. \n\nIf you\u2019d like more information about Cady, please call (505) 877-7352. Adoption fee for Cady is $300.\n",

Claudia is quiet in her crate, but when it's time to come out will become the cutest tiny wigglebutt ready to climb in your arms as you open the door. In her playgroup, she gets along well with the other small dogs on the farm but would be perfectly happy to be the only canine in your home, to be showered in all your undivided attention. Claudia can't wait to find herself her own peaceful little slice of paradise, so be sure to submit your adoption request if you think that just might be at your home!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

Our veterinary partner estimates that Frankie is 3 years old at the time of intake in January 2021. Frankie is good with people and other dogs. Our hearts broke in half when we found Frankie suffering from eye infections that no one had bothered to treat. The infection became so advanced that it caused irreversible damage to Frankie's eyes, and his eyes had to be removed. But all that means is that Frankie won't be able to see his forever family, but he will still be able to experience the love and happiness that is in store for him. Frankie is a sturdy boy weighing 25 lbs. upon intake. If Frankie's happy future can be found as a member of your family, please apply online to adopt Frankie (TX) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

            "description": "***COVID 19 NOVEMBER 2020 PROTOCOL***\n\nDue to the surge of Covid 19 and statewide restrictions, we are adopting to LOCAL (CLALLAM AND JEFFERSON COUNTY) RESIDENTS ONLY. We are not doing adoptions to Canada at this time due to the border closure. We do not ship animals. \n\nOPHS is appointment only. All potential adopters must fill out an adoption application prior to setting up an appointment to meet the animal. An application can be found on our website  https://www.ophumanesociety.org/dog-adoption-application\n\nWe have limited staff during this time, please allow 3-5 business days for us to process your application. We are screening the applications for the first BEST fit for each animal. \n\nIf you are approved, you will be contacted by us via phone or email to schedule an appointment.\n\nNAME: Cinnamon\nAGE: About 1 year\nWEIGHT: About 50 lbs\nBREED(S): Shepherd mix?\nREASON FOR ARRIVAL: Transfer from CA\n\nGENERAL INFO ABOUT PERSONALITY: Cinnamon is sweet with a little bit of spice. When she came in she was very fearful and wouldn't walk outside on a leash. She has made good progress and is now walking fairly well on leash and has been meeting other large dogs. \n\nSo far she has been pretty good with other dogs, but is a little rough and rude at first. We figure she is no older than 1 year so she still has a lot of learning to do about the world. She will need someone to help build her confidence as well as train her on all of the basics, she doesn't even know sit yet (but we are working on it!).\n\nCinnamon has a dental condition called Enamel Hypoplasia which greatly affects the integrity of the teeth. Because of this, Cinnamon will need frequent (maybe yearly) dental exams and cleanings which could add up cost wise. This will need to be managed throughout her lifetime to ensure she stays happy and healthy. \n\nActivity Level? Medium\nTraining Needs? High\nHouse Trained? Unknown\nLeash Trained? Mostly\nComfortable with kids? Unknown\nComfortable with strangers? Shy at first\nHistory with other dogs? Fairly good\nHistory with cats? Unknown\n\nAdditional MEDICAL notes: Has Enamel Hypoplasia. Will need to have frequent dental exams and cleaning throughout her life compared to a regular dog.\nAdditional BEHAVIOR notes: None\n\nADOPTION FEE: $150 for an adult dog.\n\nAdoption fee includes: Spay/neuter, initial vaccines, a microchip, rabies vaccine when appropriate, and one free veterinary visit with a local participating clinic.",

She knows what she wants, but is very polite about getting it. Lucy loves long walks on the beach, and curling up on a good warm bed.\n\nBeing the sweet and laid back girl she is, Lucy would prefer if new people approach her slow and gentle, just like she does to them. Once you're acquainted, make sure to give her all the ear scratches possible!\n\nLucy would do best in a home with a calm environment, consistent routine, and preferably as the only animal. She is happy to have play time with other dogs her size, but enjoys down time on her own. Lucy does have a very energetic and playful side to her as well, and will require daily exercise. \n\nSince Lucy is quite the catch, we anticipate a large number of inquiries. We ask for patience in waiting for a response, as we will be working diligently to find the best match for her and only reaching out to successful candidates.\n\n Primary Color: Black Secondary Color: Brindle Weight: 32.1kg Age: 3yrs 6mths 2wks Animal has been Spayed",

I will always give you a good body wiggle when you come in my room and steal your heart with the flop of my ears. Listening to your problems and solving your day is my strong suit as I am quite the attentive man. Although I love to cuddle and snuggle, playing and running is one of my favorite ways to spend the day as I am what my caregivers call high energy. As much as I love the people that care for me here, I would really love my own people to play with all the time and maybe even a sibling if the right one came along! Please apply for me today to see if I could be the one.",

I love getting treats and pets. I may look big and mighty, but I'm really just a big baby who wants all your love and attention. I also enjoy going on adventures, so I hope you take me places! I'm a social-butterfly and think it's fun meeting new human friends all the time. I'm a little more shy when it comes to doggies though, so please bring your doggy to the shelter to come meet me! I can't wait to meet you!\n\nMake an appointment to meet me at AAWL's Main Shelter!\n\nhttps://aawl.org/content/appointment-based-adoptions\n\nAAWL says I can live with humans of ALL AGES.\nAAWL says I am a WEEKEND ATHLETE, meaning I need regular exercise.\nAAWL says I am TOLERANT of dogs. Please bring potential doggy siblings to the shelter to meet me!\nAAWL does not know if I can live with cats at this time.\n\nI'm Beemer's Buddy!

He has a $150.00 adoption fee plus the cost of 6 months of heartworm prevention. \n\nNote: ARF reserves the right to deny any application that is deemed unsuitable for the animal. Please be aware that our animal adoptions are NOT on a first come- first serve basis. Our sole purpose is to find the best possible home for the animals that fall under our care. We do not ship our animals. All adopters are expected to come to Tulsa if approved.\n\nFor details on how to adopt please visit http://www.arftulsa.org/adopt.",

He is dominant, but also enjoys to be the baby at times. He absolutely LOVES his humans and will try to be around you at all times! Although he is energetic, he is not loud! He will occasionally make some noise when he gets excited, but don't be afraid of his bark, the king is just trying to make some friends!!\n\nHe knows basic commands such as sit, stay, come and go, but he needs someone to stay on track with his training. The king in him can be a bit stubborn at times! He will also require a SLOW INTRODUCTION TO MEN. He is fearful of men at first so he will bark and growl for a few minutes. After he is used to the men, he calms down and will enjoy some pets from them!\n\nOver all, King Jack aims to please his people. He will say hello and will cuddle up next to you. He has gentle eyes and soft paws that are bound to steal your heart!\n\nKing's personality will shine brightest with:\n-An ACTIVE family\n-Someone willing to continue training\n-A FENCED IN yard\n-A home where going to doggy parks and the outdoors are a thing!\n\n*A note from his foster: \"Jack likes to be pet constantly and is not shy about showing it. He loves to go on long walks and see new things. \"\n\nIf you believe KING JACK is the dog for you please fill out an adoption application: https://form.jotform.com/93263081961156\n\nIF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS PLEASE EMAIL INFO@MERCYFULLPROJECTS.ORG OR TEXT (786) 548-0651",

I will need a home that can dedicate time to my training and will be able to keep me active! I enjoy the other dogs in my foster home, and I am very interested in those things called cats! I don't chase them but do want to play with them! If our foster mom forgets to tell you I LOVE treats!!\n\nI am outgoing and I will follow my foster mom anywhere she goes! She has these big things called horses and I don't mind them even though they kind of scare me! I love to play with toys, chew on toys, and rough house.

This amazing pup has suffered through some hard times, but healed in a loving foster home. Kiran is such a wonderful boy and charms everyone he meets. This perfect pup is quirky, fun, intelligent, loving and trainable. He is high activity, perfectly house trained, loves all over dogs and adores children! Read on to learn more about Kiran.\n\nKiran is currently being fostered in Olympia, Washington and is available for meet and greets with approved adopters. To apply, please fill out an application at www.doggedly.org/adoption-app\n\nKiran had a very sad beginning, found as a stray back in September of 2020 in Houston, Texas. Kiran was standing in a grocery store parking lot searching for trash to eat. He was extremely emaciated, covered in open bloody sores and caked in dried urine and feces after recently being dumped by his owner, likely after being locked in a kennel his entire life. From the beginning, there was something special about this gentle dog. He allowed his rescuer to scoop him up and tend to his wounds immediately. Although he was frightened, Kiran had the most amazing temperament. He was extremely sweet, docile and just wanted to be loved, despite what humans had put him through.\n\nKiran grew into the most loving dog when he joined his foster family. This dog is a total love bug. Kiran loves everyone that he meets, but can be a little shy at first. He gains confidence daily and is extremely dog friendly. Kiran absolutely adores children, and loves to snuggle. After this boy gets in his daily exercise, he is a complete snuggle bug, who enjoys spending his time in your lap like a giant baby. Kiran loves to sleep in bed with you and is the best snuggler, who will lay his head on your chest. It's heartwarming and also heartbreaking to think that a dog who loves people this much was ever abandoned on the streets in such poor condition.\n\nTraining wise, Kiran is a dream dog. He is kennel trained, leash trained and absolutely perfect in the car. He can be a little wild at times in normal puppy fashion, but is an extremely smart boy who loves to please. He would thrive in a home with another confident, friendly dog. Kiran is great with both males and females. He is also respectful, and even submissive, to kitties in the home. Outdoors, he will chase anything, cats and horses included, but just because he wants to play, play, play! Kiran would adore hanging out at dog parks, is wonderful with doggy introductions and is a fun, bouncy boy who enjoys adventures. Kiran is very athetlic and currently enjoys 10 mile hikes and trail runs with his foster mom. He requires a high activity home that can give him adequate exercise he needs to balance with his snuggle buddy home life.\n\nThis incredible boy is one that you do not want to miss out on! He is an absolute gem and will not last long! Apply today to make Kiran your very best friend!\n\n",

            "description": "Sophie is a beautiful, super-sweet, well-mannered older girl. She is not full corgi, but it is believed she is part corgi / part miniature Australian Shepherd.  She lived with her first family for the first 9 years of her life, then she was surrendered to CCK. She has lived with her foster family for the past 1 \u00bd years. About a year ago she developed a dislike for another female dog in her current home. Despite efforts taken to mitigate the issue, Sophie has persisted in her dislike. Although her family loves her very much and finds this step very difficult to take, they believe she would be happier in a home where she can be the only dog.\n\nPERSONALITY: Sophie has an active, bright and alert personality. She loves to be petted and cuddled and loves to be near her person. She enjoys being a lap dog for short periods of time, although she will fall asleep in a lap from time to time. She does show a preference to women but does also respond to most men. She is tolerant of and even enjoys playing with young, active children if they are respectful of her. She is very active and will play fetch with a tennis ball, although her sessions last only 10 minutes or so. She is a destroyer of toys and loves nothing better than to de-squeak and de-stuff a toy. Due to her diminutive size and activity level, people have mistaken her for a much younger dog. \n\nSOCIALIZATION:  Sophie does not seem to have been well-socialized when she was young. She does not do well with other dogs she is not familiar with, and has had issues with a female corgi in the home she is in currently in. She sometimes will take an instant dislike to certain people, usually men. She walks well on a leash but becomes anxious when she sees another dog approaching and will vocalize loudly. She is OK in the car although she does not enjoy car rides. Sophie would prefer that strangers not approach the stopped car while she is inside. She does not like drive-thru\u2019s and will vocalize loudly if she can hear a voice through a speaker or see someone at a window, close to the vehicle.\n\nTRAINING: Sophie is perfectly house trained and is not known to have an accident in the house. She knows her name and has excellent recall. She goes out without complaint despite the weather, will take care of herself and come back immediately if necessary. She is extremely obedient and loves to please. Sophie is very smart and catches on to things very quickly. \n\nHEALTH:  For her age, Sophie is relatively free of many health issues. Unlike a full-bred corgi, Sophie sheds very little. She has a touch of arthritis in one knee and is taking Cosequin for this. Because of her anxious nature and the situation with the other dog in her current home she has been on Fluoxetine. This is a mild antidepressant for canine anxiety, which is relatively inexpensive.\n\nOVERALL:  Sophie is an amazing girl who would bloom in the right environment. A quiet home with a consistent routine where she is the only pet would be ideal. She would love to be someone\u2019s constant companion and friend! \n",

            "description": "Due to COVID-19, CITY DOGS is currently doing adoptions by APPOINTMENT ONLY. Please visit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog to request a meet and greet! \n\nQuestions? Email: citydogs@city.cleveland.oh.us | Call: (216) 664-3476\nVisit: 9203 Detroit Avenue Cleveland, OH 44102\n\nHours:\n10 AM - 3 PM Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday\n10 AM - 6 pm Tuesday & Thursday\n\nFee: $61 | Includes spay/neuter, shots, microchip, license, 30 days free pet insurance (when registered upon adoption)\n\nThe CITY DOGS mission is to increase adoptions from the City Kennel by changing the image of the pit bulls who make up the majority of the kennel population, by preparing all adoptable dogs in the kennel for lives in loving homes and by creating as many opportunities as possible for the public to meet and get to know our dogs for the terrific pets they are meant to be.\n\nOur Adoption Process...\nHere's a little about how things work:\nAll of the CITY DOGS posted for adoption are available for direct adoption from the kennel, unless noted otherwise. You must schedule a meet with a dog in advance - we are not currently accepting walk-ins. Please look online first to see if there are any dogs you think would be a good fit for your home before scheduling a meet. To get the process started, visit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog and fill out the form. One of our adoption counselors will get in touch to schedule and confirm your meet! At the kennel, an adoption counselor will introduce you and your family to the adoptable dogs, share information we know about them, and discuss our suggested ways for successfully integrating a new dog into your home. You are welcome to meet multiple dogs. If the dog you adopt is already fixed, he or she may leave with you that day - otherwise, the dog can go home after receiving the spay or neuter surgery.)\n\nAbout Our Dogs: All available dogs have gone through a behavioral and medical assessment. This assessment is a snapshot of who the dog is at that given time. We cannot make any guarantees with regard to behavior, temperament or health of any City Dog once they are in the home. Most of our dogs are picked up as strays, so we do not know what kind of home environment they were living in (i.e. with kids, other dogs or other cats), nor do we know if most of them are house trained. Everything we know about them is based on volunteer and staff observations. We do have some dogs in foster homes, where they will have more information about how the dog is in a home environment. It is very hard to tell with certainty whether or not a dog will be good with kids, cats or another dog. If you have kids in the home or another dog, we do require that they be present for a meet and greet with the dog you are considering for adoption.\n\nHeath/Vaccinations: Dogs that are adopted directly from the kennel need to go to your personal vet within two weeks of leaving the kennel. All dogs receive their DAPPL, Rabies, and Bordatella vaccines, though you may be required to get follow up boosters. All dogs come microchipped and with a Cuyahoga County license.?  \n\n\n\n \n",

She gave birth to 6 healthy adorable puppies, has been treated for Mange that she brought with her from Kentucky, been spayed and treated for Heart Worm. She is a mild tempered dog. Very intelligent, very watchful and gets along great with dogs and cats...She has never shown any sign of aggression or growled at anyone. Her legs are short so she doesn't really jump on people and depending on how high your couch and bed are it could be an issue for her getting up there. She lives the good life...sleeps pretty much during the day and can hold her bladder all night. She is housebroken likes chew toys and squeaky things. She has been know to chew on shoes;). She is a very dainty eater and does not grab at your hand when giving treats. She does not take medicine well so I have gotten very creative in hiding it food. She is not Yappy but will give a few barks to let you know if something seems off to her. She walks along nicely on a leash-as long as you go where she wants to go...lol\nHer breed is a mix of Chow/Stumpy cattle dog and Jindo. According to the DNA test that was taken.",

He thrives off of \"good boy\" and treats! He LOVES to spend time with his people. It takes him some time to get comfortable around anyone, but once he has adjusted, he becomes the most affectionate dog ever! He is looking for someone that will look at him as the only dog in world, as you to him are his whole world. He makes it known that you are his and his only by crying out of jealousy!\n\nHe LOVES to play! However, he does become a bit nervous and distracted if there are too many different and loud noises around (ex. traffic).\n\nHe will need to continue training on his food aggression. If another dog in the home, it is best to feed him separately. This behavior only occurs when there is food around, if no food he does AMAZING with other dogs. He will need someone who is willing to help him deter from this behavior.\n\nHe is also a bit fearful of men. He is receptive when men speak to him in a loving way, but still is quite nervous. Because of this we suggest a woman becoming his furever. He is the PAWFECT companion and ready to fill your heart with lots of love.\n\nPONCHO will shine best with:\n-Someone looking for a companion\n-Women\n-Retired but still active\n-Somewhere where there is room to play\n-Someone willing to train\n\nIf you believe PONCHO could be your forever buddy please fill out an adoption application: https://form.jotform.com/93263081961156\n\nIF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS PLEASE EMAIL INFO@MERCYFULLPROJECTS.ORG",

We promised her she would never spend another night out in the cold on a chain.  Betty Lou is an absolute sweet heart and an all around good girl.  She is about 8 mo old, around 20 lbs and we believe she will  stay on the smaller  when full grown.  Betty Lou loves people, other dogs and would probably be fine around cats and kids although she has not formally been tested.  Our girl is already crate trained and working on potty training and does fine on a leash.  Betty Lou is ready for a family to call her own that will love and cherish her forever.  Are you ready?\n\nIf you are interested in meeting our sweet little girl, please visit our website and fill out an application at www.littleraysofsunshineanimalrescue.org   Betty Lou's adoption fee is $350",

My name is Lynette, and I'm a 9-year-old boxer mix from Texas. Based on the wear and tear on my body, I think I've had it kind of rough up until now, and I am looking forward to a brighter future, starting with you!\n\nI'd love nothing more than to lay by your side (or, if you let me, on your lap) and snooze the day away. I am a world-class snuggler and hope that whoever adopts me does not need any personal space. I love to lick people's faces and will sometimes gently paw at their arms if I don't think I'm getting the attention I deserve. I also love toys, but not really to play with-I just like carrying them around and keeping them near me.\n\nI am a sophisticated lady and always do my business outside, and I have yet to get into anything I'm not supposed to. I take direction from my humans really well, except maybe when they're trying to get me off the couch to go somewhere-I'm just so comfy!\n\nI admit, I can be a bit cranky with other animals. Because of this, I think I'd do best as an only pet, so I can soak up all your love and attention. I also get a little distressed when there's a lot of chaos or noise. It has made me worried when I've seen rough-housing, and I've tried to intervene. So if there are kids in the home they'd need to be older, quiet, and respectful, and ideally also let me snuggle with them.\n\nI am currently being treated for heartworm, but I am still available to Foster to Adopt. This means that you get to take me home now to keep forever, but I won't be \"officially\" yours until I'm done my treatment, which can take a few months. During treatment, which the rescue pays for, my only exercise can be short potty breaks. That shouldn't be a big problem for me since I am already a big couch potato, so don't let this part scare you away! Please ask the rescue if you have any questions about heartworm or heartworm treatment.\n\nIn the meantime, if you are looking for the world's best snuggle companion to keep you warm in these winter months, fill out an application to meet me today!\n\nCompletion of an Adoption Application via our website (www.RescueCrew.org) is the best way to show your interest in an animal and is the first step in the adoption process.\n\nAll companion animals adopted by The Rescue Crew are spayed/neutered, up-to-date on age appropriate vaccinations, tested for FIV/FeLK (cats) or heartworm (dogs), microchipped, dewormed and provided with monthly flea/tick and heartworm preventatives.\n\nThe Rescue Crew is a foster based rescue organization, meaning all of our adoptable pets are located in homes throughout Minnesota. We do not have a physical location where you can stop by to visit the animals - we require the completion of an Adoption Application prior to meeting any of our adoptable pets in foster care.\n\nFor the most complete information regarding this animal, and all of our adoptable pets, please ensure you are visiting our website directly at www.RescueCrew.org. You can also access the necessary online adoption application here as well.",

I am a sweet puppy that is still learning my way around this big world. I will need a person/family that has the time and patience to help me become the best puppy I can be.

RAC staff will be in touch with approved applicants to schedule a meet and greet. My adoption fee is $125 which includes my spay, rabies, microchip, first round of puppy boosters, and dewormer. I will have to return to RAC for my spay, rabies, and microchip at the pre-scheduled date which will be given at the time of adoption.

Good with older considerate children, dogs, and cats.\n\nGSRA adopts to residents of VA, NC, and SC only\n\nMurphy's a very wiggly, happy, playful boy full of puppy energy. He's good with large and small dogs, he's very respectful of dogs who don't want to play with him. He also previously lived with cats but without another dog in the home he will chase the cats to try to get them to play with him. He's a good car rider, a decent leash walker - he loves to carry a stick during his walk, and is learning to settle in his crate although it's not his favorite place to be. Murphy loves to run with his foster siblings and tolerates their more dominant personalities well but will let them know when he's had enough of their chompy play style. He would do best with a fenced yard or large property to run in (he doesn't appear to have a high prey drive). He needs a playmate. He's a high energy boy who will need outlets to burn off steam so he doesn't find his own entertainment. If you think he sounds like a perfect boy you'd be right!! The only thing Murphy cannot have in his forever home are small children. If you're looking for a buddy to exercise with and then curl up on the couch for a movie and popcorn then Murphy's the guy for you.\n\nIt is GSRA policy that we do not adopt dogs under the age of 1 year to families with children under the age of 8 years old.For more information on our adoptable pet list please visit: Adoptable Pet List\n\nPlease join us at our next Event(s):\n\nCurrent Scheduled Events:",

He lived in a home with two other dogs, but when one of the other dogs attacked him, his owner surrendered him at the vet. Poor Hank lost his family, and was given over to a shelter. Thanks to a wonderful foster, our rescue was able to pull him back into a home environment. Hank doesn't hold a grudge, and is still considered dog friendly. However, we believe a calmer dog would be a better companion for him as opposed to a highly energetic, hyper dog. His gentle nature would make him a wonderful family dog! We are unsure about how he would do with cats, but we can test him if needed.\n\nInterested? Great! Submit an application at www.caninecastawaysrescue.org. The application approval process can take up to 7 business days. Once approved, we will contact you for that highly anticipated meet and greet with your whole family, including any existing dogs in your home!\n\nNot ready to commit to being a full time fur mommy or daddy? You can apply to foster! Just fill out our foster application on our website, and be as thorough as possible so we can match you with a great fit for you and your home!",

This cute girl loves everyone she meets, and would likely even do well in a home with respectful kids! Missy is a little shy when it comes to meeting other dogs, but could likely warm up to another calm dog. Missy must meet new canine companions one-on-one to ensure they are a good match. Missy loves attention from her favorite people! This girl will require guidance and supervision learning to use the bathroom outside only, but our staff can give you tips to help with this.",

At five months old, Gina has a bit more growing to do and will probably have a lot of puppy energy once she is fully relaxed. The Urban Dictionary defines someone with the name of Gina as a little shy at first but once you get to know her you'll realize that she's the greatest thing ever! We suspect that our Gina will live up to her name. Staff have described Gina as alert and wiggly. Also that she is easy to leash and walk. As we learn more about her personality, this information will be updated. If you're ready for a new puppy addition to your home, maybe Gina would be the greatest dog ever for you!

Annabelle, or \"Annie\", is as sweet as they come! She loves people and other dogs, and would be a fantastic family dog. She was not reactive to the cats that hang around the rescue upon intake, but we are unsure at this time how she would do with a cat in the home. We can further test if needed.\n\nInterested? Great! Submit an application at www.caninecastawaysrescue.org. The application approval process can take up to 7 business days. Once approved, we will contact you for that highly anticipated meet and greet with your whole family, including any existing dogs in the home!\n\nNot ready to commit to being a full time fur mommy or daddy? You can apply to foster! Just fill out our foster application on our website, and be very thorough so we can match you with a great fit for you and your home!",

            "description": "Date of birth: 12/10/2019\n\n1/30/2021: Bobby is an adorable American Staffordshire mix!  He has cute B&W markings, and we love his underbite! He is a year old and weighs 38 lbs. \n\n\u2022 Bobby is friendly and very playful. He\u2019ll need daily exercise.  He\u2019ll be a fun companion for someone wanting an active dog. And he\u2019s a great size! \n\n\u2022 Bobby likes other dogs and would love to have another playful dog to play with in his home. We\u2019d ask you to bring your dog to meet Bobby to see if they could be buddies.\n\n\u2022 He\u2019ll need a house with a fenced yard.\n\n\u2022 Bobby will need a home where he\u2019s not left alone a lot\u2014 either in a home with a person who\u2019s home a lot, or with another dog for companionship. He seeks companionship. He does not like to be left in the yard by himself for long. \n\n\u2022 He needs a home without young kids. He\u2019s bouncy and rambunctious and needs to learn more manners.\n\n\u2022 He\u2019s crate trained. \n\n\u2022 Bobby has been neutered, vaccinated, microchipped and tested for heartworms. He\u2019s a sweet boy who\u2019ll be a wonderful match for someone wanting an active companion for themselves and/or their dog.\n\nMORE ON ADOPTING OUR DOGS... \n\n> COVID-19 UPDATE:  PLEASE SUBMIT AN ONLINE ADOPTION APPLICATION AND A MEMBER OF OUR ADOPTIONS TEAM WILL REACH OUT TO YOU.  Please visit our web site at HSGKC.ORG for an adoption application, our current COVID-19 adoption protocol, and other adoption info.\u00a0\n\n> If you decide you'd like to adopt one of the pets you meet, we reserve the pet for you but we generally don't send the pet home with you that day. We\u2019ll instead schedule a pick up date and time that\u2019s convenient for you.\u00a0  \n\n> Our goal is to send you home with a healthy pet and any information and support you may need to help your new pet adjust to his or her new home.  All of our dogs & puppies have been spayed or neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, treated for fleas & ticks, tested for heartworms (7 mo. and over), and are on monthly heartworm preventative. Puppies who are too young to receive all the necessary puppy boosters and/or first rabies shot may be brought back to us for those vaccines at no extra charge. You will also receive a leash, collar, coupons for pet supplies and services, toys, and educational materials. And we'll give your dog a bath before he or she goes home! \n\n> Please note that we prefer and may require a fenced yard for many of our dogs.  Exceptions are made on an individual basis depending on the dog's needs, the person's dog experience, the dog's and person's activity levels, home environment and other factors. \n\nThank you for searching for a shelter pet!\n\nDog Adoption Contact Info:\nEmail: christine@hsgkc.org\nPhone: 913.521.2339\nhsgkc.org",

To adopt, complete our online adoption application and an Adoption Counselor will contact you within 48-hours to schedule your adoption appointment. Adoptions for any pets in foster will be completed offsite at our PetSmart Claiborne location on a case by case basis. The safety of our foster parents and community is of utmost importance to us and it will be at the foster's discretion if they'd like to meet at this time. Thank you for choosing adoption! \n\nUnas is a happy wiggle butt kind of girl who walks nicely on leash and loves affection.  She now just needs a chance to show you what a great addition she would be to your family.\n\nTo inquire about an adoptable animal from the Louisiana SPCA, please call 504.368.5191, ext. 150 to speak with an adoption counselor.\nTo see more adoptable animals from the Louisiana SPCA, please go to http://la-spca.org/adopt.\n\n\n\nThe petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n",

            "description": "First let me say..Moyo means heart in Swahili for the only coloring on her aside her nose is the heart shaped splotch on her eye.\n\nOn Nov 21st 2021 we took in this beautiful but scared abandoned 10m old baby from Homestead FL.  About 5 days before her family was evicted and they left her out in the cold rain with the trash when they moved.  She never left the property and was terrified when the landlord came to check on things after complaints were made of the dog being abandoned. Rescues were contacted and no one stepped up ..so we did.  \n\nShe was then brought to West Palm where we began to give her the nutrition she needed, socialize her and work with her. She is now ready for that forever home.\n\nIdeal home.. a fenced yard with another dog..shes currently with 4 females close in size..doesnt seem to like little dogs much..so a home with like size is better. \n\nShe loves to play, tug o war, catch me if you can, fetch and just is an overall good girl.  She is crate trained and I imagine house broken. She's smart and highly trainable. Not likely the best with cats either but not certain. \n\nPlease when sending an inquiry about her ..mention your home setting and other dogs size and age. She was born near Jan 2020. Also must give a phone number. Thank you",

I'm a very expressive guy that is the perfect mix of stubborn and sweet. My striking face makes me look like quite the dignified fellow, don't you think? My affectionate personality and outstanding leash skills are two of my best traits. In fact, I'll walk right by your side without pulling a bit, to make sure I'm protecting you from any strangers. I'm a real gentle giant, so to speak, and I'm known by my friends at CARE to be a total sweetheart. I've mastered the \"sit,\" \"shake,\" and \"down\" commands, but I'd like to learn more. Don't worry, I'm very vocal, so I'll let you know exactly what I want, and if you don't listen to me, I will plant my paws down and show you my stubborn streak. I love meeting new people and playing in the snow. Making snow angels is so much fun! Toys are a little interesting, but I'd rather be next to someone and be their loyal companion. I've been known to lay my head in volunteers' laps. I'm looking so hard to find just the right person, someone who is strong enough to handle a dog of my size and powerful strength. I hope it's you!\nAdoption Information: Size: Extra Large / 80 lbs Children: No Dogs: No Cats: Unknown Experience: Needs an experienced Mastiff handler Adoption Fee: $300 This dog is neutered, microchipped and has had a full veterinary checkup and vaccines.\nIf you are interested in more information or would like to meet this dog, please fill out our online adoption survey: carenorthshore.org/dog-adoption-survey",

            "description": "I am a fun loving energetic puppy! I hopped on my Freedom Ride from TX in mid January. Since I've been in the cold MN, I'm learning what snow is and how to adapt. Though it's not my favorite thing, I still enjoy going out and playing with the other dogs in it. I currently live in a household with multiple other dogs of all ages and love playing with all of them. Being a typical puppy, I enjoy chewing on toys(and pretty much anything I can get my mouth on) and cuddling up on your lap to nap. My foster family says I play hard and sleep even harder. Though humans are not exactly sure what exactly breeds I am, I most definitely look like I have some Boxer in me. If you're looking for a spunky fun loving gal, I'm your pup! Bailey's adoption fee is $400 which covers her spay, vaccinations appropriate at the time of adoption, microchip and any additional medical care she may have needed while in the rescues care. We are a foster based rescue, we do not house dogs at a facility. Age and breed, are NLR's best guess as we often don't know who or what mom and dad are.

I'm is a 12 week old cattle dog / hound / pit mix (okay, I'm not really sure what my breed is but I'm cute and loveable just the same) weighing around 16 lbs. I love to play with puppies and adult dogs as well as older kids in my foster home. I play hard and sleep hard. The humans tell me I'm doing great with crate training and I sleep all night until someone comes to let me out to go outside. I'm working on walking on a leash even though I don't know why I need that thing. I like the white fluffy stuff outside but it can get COLD out there. I like toys to chew on and they tell me I have a cute \"hop\" when I'm trying to catch your attention from inside a puppy pen.

            "description": "Date of birth:  12/2016\n\n1/30/2021:  Sparrow is a pretty Black Lab mix! She\u2019s 4 years old and she currently weighs about 50 lbs, but she should weigh about 55-60 lbs.  \n\n\u2022 Sparrow was neglected in her previous home and was horribly underweight. We\u2019ve included a photo of her taken when she first arrived. The poor girl weighed just 26 lbs.  We\u2019ve put much needed weight on her and she\u2019s close to an appropriate weight now.\n\n\u2022 Sparrow is friendly and very playful\u2014 she acts like a puppy!  She\u2019s got lots of energy. \n\n\u2022 Sparrow needs a home with a fenced yard.  She can be a barker, so she would not be a good match for an apartment.  \n\n\u2022 Sparrow is super smart and, no surprise, she is extremely food motivated. She likes to play with balls with treats in them, and she\u2019d love thinker toys.  She would probably love agility classes and do well in them.  \n\n\u2022 She needs basic training. She jumps up on people, so we\u2019re working with her on that but she\u2019ll need continued training. As mentioned, she\u2019s very much like a puppy and she\u2019ll need all the guidance and training and house training that a puppy would need! \n\n\u2022 Sparrow would be a good match for some but not all dogs. She\u2019d need a very playful doggie companion. If you have a dog, we\u2019d ask you to bring your dog in to meet Sparrow to see if they could be buddies. \n\n\u2022 She needs a home without young kids at this point because she jumps up on people and is too rambunctious.  \n\n\u2022 Sadly, Sparrow tested positive for heartworms. She will have her first treatment on March 8. For several weeks following she\u2019ll need to be on restricted activity. If you are interested in fostering or adopting Sparrow, we can tell you more about her treatment plan. All costs will be covered. \n\n\u2022 Sparrow has been spayed, vaccinated and microchipped. She\u2019s an extremely sweet girl who\u2019s been through a lot \u2014 she deserves a loving home. \n\nMORE ON ADOPTING OUR DOGS... \n\n> COVID-19 UPDATE:  PLEASE SUBMIT AN ONLINE ADOPTION APPLICATION AND A MEMBER OF OUR ADOPTIONS TEAM WILL REACH OUT TO YOU.  Please visit our web site at HSGKC.ORG for an adoption application, our current COVID-19 adoption protocol, and other adoption info.\u00a0\n\n> If you decide you'd like to adopt one of the pets you meet, we reserve the pet for you but we generally don't send the pet home with you that day. We\u2019ll instead schedule a pick up date and time that\u2019s convenient for you.\u00a0  \n\n> Our goal is to send you home with a healthy pet and any information and support you may need to help your new pet adjust to his or her new home.  All of our dogs & puppies have been spayed or neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, treated for fleas & ticks, tested for heartworms (7 mo. and over), and are on monthly heartworm preventative. Puppies who are too young to receive all the necessary puppy boosters and/or first rabies shot may be brought back to us for those vaccines at no extra charge. You will also receive a leash, collar, coupons for pet supplies and services, toys, and educational materials. And we'll give your dog a bath before he or she goes home! \n\n> Please note that we prefer and may require a fenced yard for many of our dogs.  Exceptions are made on an individual basis depending on the dog's needs, the person's dog experience, the dog's and person's activity levels, home environment and other factors. \n\nThank you for searching for a shelter pet!\n\nDog Adoption Contact Info:\nEmail: christine@hsgkc.org\nPhone: 913.521.2339\nhsgkc.org",

            "description": "Date of birth:  1/2016\n\n1/30/2021:  Nutmeg is a super cute Beagle/Catahoula mix!  She\u2019s 5 years old and weighs 60 lbs. She\u2019s a very sweet natured girl and she\u2019s playful. \n\n\u2022 Nutmeg walks nicely on a leash.  She typically doesn\u2019t react to other dogs she sees when we take her on leash walks. She has some manners and doesn\u2019t jump up on people. \n\n\u2022 She can be a barker when she wants something, so wouldn\u2019t be a good match for an apartment.\n\n\u2022 She can get a bit anxious here with some panting and drooling, and then drinking water and needing to go outside more often.  This may not be an issue in a home, but we think she\u2019d do best in a home with someone who is home a lot to lessen any potential anxiety and so that she can be let outside frequently to avoid accidents while she adjusts to her new home.\n\n\u2022 Nutmeg is choosy about her doggie friends. If you have a dog, we\u2019d ask you to bring your dog in to meet Nutmeg to see if they could be buddies. \n\n\u2022 She\u2019s very food motivated.\n\n\u2022 Nutmeg was a stray and she\u2019d had puppies before coming to us.  She\u2019s been spayed, vaccinated, microchipped and tested for heartworms. She\u2019s a cutie! \n\nMORE ON ADOPTING OUR DOGS... \n\n> COVID-19 UPDATE:  PLEASE SUBMIT AN ONLINE ADOPTION APPLICATION AND A MEMBER OF OUR ADOPTIONS TEAM WILL REACH OUT TO YOU.  Please visit our web site at HSGKC.ORG for an adoption application, our current COVID-19 adoption protocol, and other adoption info.\u00a0\n\n> If you decide you'd like to adopt one of the pets you meet, we reserve the pet for you but we generally don't send the pet home with you that day. We\u2019ll instead schedule a pick up date and time that\u2019s convenient for you.\u00a0  \n\n> Our goal is to send you home with a healthy pet and any information and support you may need to help your new pet adjust to his or her new home.  All of our dogs & puppies have been spayed or neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, treated for fleas & ticks, tested for heartworms (7 mo. and over), and are on monthly heartworm preventative. Puppies who are too young to receive all the necessary puppy boosters and/or first rabies shot may be brought back to us for those vaccines at no extra charge. You will also receive a leash, collar, coupons for pet supplies and services, toys, and educational materials. And we'll give your dog a bath before he or she goes home! \n\n> Please note that we prefer and may require a fenced yard for many of our dogs.  Exceptions are made on an individual basis depending on the dog's needs, the person's dog experience, the dog's and person's activity levels, home environment and other factors. \n\nThank you for searching for a shelter pet!\n\nDog Adoption Contact Info:\nEmail: christine@hsgkc.org\nPhone: 913.521.2339\nhsgkc.org",

            "description": "Date of birth:  12/2015\n\n1/30/2021:  Clover is an absolutely adorable Bull Terrier mix!  She is 5 years old and she weighs 50 lbs, but she needs to gain some weight.  Clover\u2019s had a rough life and she ended up at KCK Animal Services. She\u2019d had a litter of puppies and then developed mastitis (infected mammaries) and pyometra (uterine infection). We did emergency surgery to save her life. She\u2019s healed up now and doing well.\n\n\u2022 Clover can be timid around new people and in new places, but she warms up quickly with treats\u2014 she\u2019s very food motivated.  Once she knows you she\u2019s a real sweetheart!  \n\n\u2022 Clover needs a home with someone who has dog experience (not someone who is looking for their first dog as an adult).  She\u2019ll be a wonderful and devoted companion for the person who gives her the time and attention she deserves. \n\n\u2022 She can be vocal and would not be a good match for an apartment. We'd like her to have house with a fenced yard.  She is not a good candidate to take to a dog park. \n\n\u2022 Clover lived with another dog in her previous home, but she\u2019s been unsure around the other dogs here.  If you have a dog, we\u2019d ask you to bring your dog to meet Clover to see if they could be buddies.  \n\n\u2022 She\u2019s been reactive towards other dogs when she\u2019s walking on a leash. She\u2019s improving and is less reactive than when she first arrived. She'll need a home with someone who can work with her on that, and she is quite strong. \n\n\u2022 Clover needs a home without young kids. She also has a prey drive and needs a home without cats.\n\n\u2022 She is crate trained.  \n\n\u2022 Clover has been spayed, vaccinated, microchipped and tested for heartworms.  She\u2019s a super sweet girl and she loves people\u2014 she\u2019ll be a loving and loyal companion. \n\nMORE ON ADOPTING OUR DOGS... \n\n> COVID-19 UPDATE:  PLEASE SUBMIT AN ONLINE ADOPTION APPLICATION AND A MEMBER OF OUR ADOPTIONS TEAM WILL REACH OUT TO YOU.  Please visit our web site at HSGKC.ORG for an adoption application, our current COVID-19 adoption protocol, and other adoption info.\u00a0\n\n> If you decide you'd like to adopt one of the pets you meet, we reserve the pet for you but we generally don't send the pet home with you that day. We\u2019ll instead schedule a pick up date and time that\u2019s convenient for you.\u00a0  \n\n> Our goal is to send you home with a healthy pet and any information and support you may need to help your new pet adjust to his or her new home.  All of our dogs & puppies have been spayed or neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, treated for fleas & ticks, tested for heartworms (7 mo. and over), and are on monthly heartworm preventative. Puppies who are too young to receive all the necessary puppy boosters and/or first rabies shot may be brought back to us for those vaccines at no extra charge. You will also receive a leash, collar, coupons for pet supplies and services, toys, and educational materials. And we'll give your dog a bath before he or she goes home! \n\n> Please note that we prefer and may require a fenced yard for many of our dogs.  Exceptions are made on an individual basis depending on the dog's needs, the person's dog experience, the dog's and person's activity levels, home environment and other factors. \n\nThank you for searching for a shelter pet!\n\nDog Adoption Contact Info:\nEmail: christine@hsgkc.org\nPhone: 913.521.2339\nhsgkc.org",

            "description": "About 3 years old, this handsome hound mix is Finian. He has the most gorgeous white coat with the most adorable brindle patches scattered about. We are especially smitten with the cute ones on his ears! Finian is a super friendly guy with medium level energy to match his medium build, weighing about 45 lbs. Happy to join you on a long stroll around the neighborhood, some playtime in the backyard, or just binge-watching TV on the couch, Finian gets along well with the other dogs on the farm and absolutely loves people! Be sure to ask about him at your adoption appointment!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

            "description": "We are pleased to introduce this young black lab mix, Jocelyn, who is as sweet and scrumptious as her Oreo-colored coat. At 42 lbs herself, Jocelyn gets along with dogs of all sizes: small, medium, or large. Having previously been an indoor dog, she already knows her way around a home but at just shy of a year old, she is still a young pup that would surely benefit from some formal training and guidance to continue to mold her into the best dog she can be. While Jocelyn's appearance and energy level may be average, she is here to tell you she is anything but! The home that adopters her is sure to be a lucky one. So get in your adoption request to meet Jocelyn!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

            "description": "It only takes one look in this boy's eyes to see the sweetness in his soul. Kilroy is a beautiful black lab and pit mix with a touch of white fur on his chest. He is a young fella just around a year old, but with a more reserved personality than some of his similar age and breed mix pals. Although he can be a touch shy at first meeting, it doesn't take long for this kind fella to open up and become a happy, playful pup. He is getting along well with the other dogs on the farm and enjoying attention from volunteers, but what he really wants is a home all his own. Could that home be with you?!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

Pepper is a wonderful little girl who is very scared right now. She has been moved around and her babies were adopted from her. Pepper is looking for a special home where she can feel safe and comforted. She would love to find her a perfect forever home.

Due to the current regulations set forth by Governor Pritzker on group gatherings we will not be having adoption events until further notice. As an all foster based rescue this means that all meets will be by appointment only. Your whole family must be available to attend the meet as there will be no second meets scheduled to help limit contact between our team and the public. To help streamline the process please make sure your current pets are up to date, you have landlord/HOA approval, and that you are prepared to take the dog home with you immediately before submitting an application. Thank you & Please stay safe!***\n\nEster just arrived! Network to us from a rescue partner in the south and is approximately 4mos old. Our partners got a late night call that a puppy had been attacked by a bigger dog and needed medical help asap. The owners agreed that surrendering her to our rescue partners were in her best interest so she could get the help she needed. Ester leg is almost back to normal and she is now ready to find her forever home. After settling into foster care we have learned that Ester does not do well with other dogs most likely due to her past so\nher forever home must have no other dogs.\n\nEster loves kids though and is very cuddly and loves to lay by your feet. She loves to play outside. And is getting the hang of potty training right away!\n\nBreed and size once full grown is not a guarantee as she came into rescue without either parent.\n\nIf you are interested in adoption, please complete the Application to Adopt which you can find on our website (\nwww.magnificentmutts.org\n) No phone calls please. Emails only.\n\nAdoption Donation $300 (cash only)\n\nPlease visit www.magnificentmutts.org for the online dog or cat application.\n\nAdoption Fees*\n\nAdult cats starting at $125, Kittens starting at $165.\nDogs/Puppies starting at $225 minimum\nPrices subject to change, please contact for specific adoption donations.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Please contact Jenny Cope (giveadogahome@live.com) for more information about this pet.\n\nBe sure to read ALL information provided.\n\nA PET IS FOR LIFE -\nTHINK ABOUT THE INVESTMENT!\n\nFEN was saved from a high kill shelter in Texas where dogs often have only 3 days to be saved. FEN is neutered rabies, core vaccines, heartworm/tick disease tested negative for all. He is de-wormed, monthly preventatives and microchipped. At the time of rescue in the middle of January 2021, he weighed around 15.00 pounds and has an estimated date of birth 7 January 2018\n\n. We cannot say for sure what breed he is, so we expect families to do their own research on his look and size and decide what breed you think she is and if you have the lifestyle suitable for his needs.\n\nFEN arrived at the rescue on 15th January 2021 and was lucky enough to be adopted on 18th January 2021, however, sadly on 28 January we had an email from the adopter saying things were not working out with Fen and the young daughter. He had growled at her when she was feeding him, nipped at her face (didn't break the skin) when she went to kiss him and chased her when she came out of her bedroom.\n\nOther than these issues with the young daughter, FEN had been great, he had been to the groomer and did fantastic having a full spa, bath, nail trim, ears cleaned and teeth brushed. He has gained some very much needed weight and the family was trying to teach him what toys were.\n\nFen has clearly had a rough life before he ended up in the shelter, he has scars on him, was extremely skinny and just looked exhausted, no doubt from trying to survive in the extreme heat and living on the streets in El Paso. At the time of writing, Fen has only been back at the rescue for a few hours, however, he is living up in the house with 25 other dogs ranging from small terrier, up to 120 pound German Shepherds with all breeds, ages and sizes in between. He has curled up next to me on the couch and is happy just chilling out - but keeping a watchful eye on the other dogs.\n\nFen would benefit from a family without small children, who can le him settle and decompress from another change this poor boy has had to adapt to. He would be great as the only dog, or with another dog. Fen doesn't know how to play and the family had been trying to introduce him to toys, whilst at the rescue before his adoption he was living in a communal area with 15 other small dogs and did great and he enjoyed chewing on cow hooves.\n\nAlthough a smaller dog, we are looking for a family who will take him on walks and let him explore different places and lead a physically and mentally healthy lifestyle\n\nMore pictures and possible video's can be found on his page on the rescue website.\n\nAll dogs use dog doors to go out and do their business or to enjoy the cool, fresh weather in their dog runs or communal areas. We cannot say if a dog is house-trained, however, we expect families to understand that all dogs need a transition period and accidents could happen and training is most definitely needed.\n\nYou MUST understand that dogs need time to decompress and adapt to their new environment and home. It is a HUGE transition they make from the kill shelter, being vetted, on transport for 3 days and arriving in Maine where the temperature and such is very different to what they have only known. In rescue there is what is known as the \"3 Point Rule\" Days 1-3 your dog is stressed, anxious, confused as to where they are now. Weeks 1-3 your dog is adjusting, settling in, learning things. At the 3 month point, your dog understands they are home, and have built up a trusting relationship where they feel loved and secure.\n\nAll dogs are fed Rachael Ray Nutrish PEAK Natural Dry Dog Food, Grain Free Western Grasslands Recipe with Bison. Rachael Ray Nutrish Peak Dog Food receives the Dog Food Advisor's second-highest tier rating of 4.5 stars.\n\nFEN is available for adoption for an adoption fee of $550\n\nThis fee is not negotiable and is used to cover the rescue costs of pulling, vetting, health certificate, transport from Texas to Maine, monthly preventatives, supplements, food, general day to day cost of running a brick and mortar rescue and anything else that is needed. Canadian adopters need to know that customs charge 15% taxes when entering into Canada.\n\nDue to borders being closed, it is up to families to call the US and Canadian borders to find the current details on border crossing. Animal Welfare is deemed essential in the US, but quarantine rules entering back into Canada must be followed.\n\nIf you feel that you have the heart and home to give this precious soul a wonderful life, please go to our website, under the ADOPTION INFO tab, complete, then submit the APPLICATION. Our process takes around 1-2 days, and ensuring your references are aware that we will be calling, could speed up the process. Once you have been approved, we discuss any questions in regards to the dog you are wanting to adopt, then you complete and submit the contract, make payment and then we can work out the pick up / transport arrangements.\n\nPlease do NOT submit an application if you are not looking to take home a new best friend within the next few weeks.\n\nhttps://www.giveadogahome-sanantonio.org/forms/form?formid=5838\n\nALL Dogs are LOCATED AT THE RESCUE IN SEBEC, MAINE. We post in various states along the east coast and Canada where we have had lots of successful adoptions to enable more exposure for these beautiful saved souls. Families will need to be prepared to travel to the rescue to meet and take home their new best friend. Sebec is located just outside the towns of Dover-Foxcroft and Milo (approx 8 miles) and approx 45 miles from Bangor. There are also lots of hotels, motels, pet friendly accommodations and wonderful camp-sites for the more adventurous families and what a great way to get to know your new best friend.\n\nClick here to watch a video of FEN-AR.",

She is silly, active, and just an all around joy to have around. \n\nRuthie is a Husky - which means ACTIVE and SMART! She is seeking a family that can keep up with daily exercise and socialization. She also loves to sing the song of her people - so she's looking for a family that understands Huskies are silly breeds who need families that don't mind a little shenanigan in their life!  \n\nRuthie is ~8 months old and about 45 lbs. We anticipate she'll be a good sized girl in the 60 lbs range when she is done growing. She'd likely be best suited for a home environment that has a stable, fenced in yard. \n\nRuthie lives with other dogs and some little humans. She would do great as part of a pack or as a solo girl as long as her family is committed to dog park dates! She is a bit interested in kitties - so a family with kitties would have to ensure a proper introduction. \n\nRuthie will be fully vetted ahead of her adoption and we anticipate she'll be ready to head home within the first couple of weeks of February. \n\nRuthie is still in Houston and her adoption will be a long-distance one. Ruthie will travel to her adoptive family following the application and contract process.\n\nRuthie's adoption fee is $500 (which includes the cost of transport) \n\nIf you have questions about Ruthie, please email us at adoptions@reggiesfriends.org \n\nIf you'd like to apply to adopt Ruthie, you can do so via our website at https://reggiesfriends.org/about/adoption/dogapp/\n\n",

            "description": "Angel is an adorable little dog with Dobby-ears.  Like Dobby, she is very shy and timid when meeting new people and gets anxious when there\u2019s too much activity.  She finds comfort and security in her crate which is her haven when she\u2019s feeling nervous.  Angel is looking for a quiet home with only adults to help her learn to trust humans again, and another small, calm dog to give her companionship.\n\nAngel needs a family willing to be very patient and allow her to open up on her own terms.  She is very anxious when being approached or petted, she may flinch when first touched.  She has not shown much interest in playing with toys yet, but does like to play with the resident dog in her foster home as she becomes more comfortable in her environment.  She has not yet interacted with cats.\n\nShe is a good girl and is house-trained and uses a pee-pad when her humans are away too long for her tiny bladder.  Angel walks well on her leash with opportunity to stop and sniff or explore.  She loves a good car ride and lays quietly on the seat.  Even though she can be visibly nervous going to places, such as the vet, she remains well-behaved and will follow the directions of a trusted human.\n\nAngel is very well crate-trained and also stays in a wire pen for longer periods.  It is recommended that her home be equipped with areas, that give her the opportunity to retreat to in safety when she\u2019s feeling overwhelmed.\n\nShe is very nervous now, but with a lot of time and patience, she will be a delightful addition to her new family.  She has been through a lot in the first few years of her life and she deserves a quiet, loving home to show her that she can trust humans again and feel safe in her home and with her family.  Angel is super sweet and deserves the opportunity to spread her wings.\n\nRequirements:\n-fully secured fenced yard (no electric fence)\n-no apartments\n-no bark collars, shock collars, or prong collars\n-no children in the home\n-another calm, respectful dog under 20 lbs in the home",

These sweeties need be adopted together as they are very bonded.\n\nJoy and Leo's dad passed away in early January, and the family was unable to find anyone to take them. Their dad was elderly, so Joy and Leo did their business outside mostly in the yard. As they are a bit stressed and confused right now, they will need some potty training to go outside in their new home. Both dogs are very active and require ample exercise, a fenced in yard would be required so they can romp and play. Leo will dig to get out of the yard, so the backyard area must be secure and owners should be observant. Both dogs are full breed and actual siblings same parents, different years. They have never been around young children, so older children is advisable. Leo loves squeaky toys where Joy enjoys bones. Both dogs love to be praised and respond to affection.",

These sweeties need be adopted together as they are very bonded.\n\nJoy and Leo's dad passed away in early January, and the family was unable to find anyone to take them. Their dad was elderly, so Joy and Leo did their business outside mostly in the yard. As they are a bit stressed and confused right now, they will need some potty training to go outside in their new home. Both dogs are very active and require ample exercise, a fenced in yard would be required so they can romp and play. Leo will dig to get out of the yard, so the backyard area must be secure and owners should be observant. Both dogs are full breed and actual siblings same parents, different years. They have never been around young children, so older children is advisable. Leo loves squeaky toys where Joy enjoys bones. Both dogs love to be praised and respond to affection.",

Due to the current regulations set forth by Governor Pritzker on group gatherings we will not be having adoption events until further notice. As an all foster based rescue this means that all meets will be by appointment only. Your whole family must be available to attend the meet as there will be no second meets scheduled to help limit contact between our team and the public. To help streamline the process please make sure your current pets are up to date, you have landlord/HOA approval, and that you are prepared to take the dog home with you immediately before submitting an application. Thank you & Please stay safe!***\n\nNetwork to us from a rescue partner in the south Darby just arrived. Approximately 5 years old and super cute! Check back for more information and possible restrictions once he fully settles into foster care.\n\nIf you are interested in adoption, please complete the Application to Adopt which you can find on our website (\nwww.magnificentmutts.org\n) No phone calls please. Emails only.\n\nAdoption Donation $300 (cash only)\n\nPlease visit www.magnificentmutts.org for the online dog or cat application.\n\nAdoption Fees*\n\nAdult cats starting at $125, Kittens starting at $165.\nDogs/Puppies starting at $225 minimum\nPrices subject to change, please contact for specific adoption donations.",

            "description": "Meet Benson, he is a 7 month old, 68 lb., Great Pyrenees, looking for his forever home.  Benson is a typical puppy, he is a big love.  Benson came into rescue after being stuck by a car and left for dead.  Benson had surgery on his back hind leg, he gets along well, but he sometimes needs to be made to slowdown so he does not over strain his hind leg.  Who ever ends up adopting Benson, will need to keep him from over doing that leg.  At this time he needs nothing further done.  Benson enjoys the company of other dogs, unsure of cats, and loves his people. Best with no small children, older sturdy kids are fine. He will also need a home where the yard in fenced.  Interested adopters should fill out the application\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please apply online, at https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/. \n\nOur main website, www.bigfluffydogs.com has more information about us and the rescue process. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters should understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. Homes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for 1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (i.e. a 4-month-old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break). 2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise. 3.) Socialization.  The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home. 4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded ten-fold, for years to come.  Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy.  Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time-consuming and can be expensive. All dogs require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well-socialized dog is more than worth the effort to get them there.",

            "description": "Meet Zion, he is a 8.5 month old, 85 lb Great Pyrenees mix.  Zion has special medical needs and his future family needs to be ok with these.  Zion has Glanzmann's Thrombasthenia (an extremely rare platelet blood disorder). Injury requires a plasma transfusion.  The blood dyscrasia sounds horrible but is quite manageable.   Zion requires a home with a physical fence, he is best as an only dog.  He has not been with cats. He is currently in a foster home in PA and doing very well!  Interested adopters can fill out the application below.  \n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please apply online, at https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/. \n\nOur main website, www.bigfluffydogs.com has more information about us and the rescue process. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters should understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. Homes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for 1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (i.e. a 4-month-old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break). 2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise. 3.) Socialization.  The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home. 4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded ten-fold, for years to come.  Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy.  Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time-consuming and can be expensive. All dogs require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well-socialized dog is more than worth the effort to get them there.",

We did not realize she was pregnant until several weeks after her arrival. She had 8 beautiful puppies, as you can see! There are 4 males and 4 females. They are equally split between black and brown too! They have all had their first 2 rounds of puppy vaccines and have been dewormed. They will need 2 more boosters to be considered fully vaccinated. After adoption, we require that each puppy be spayed or neutered. You will be reimbursed a portion of the adoption fee once you provide proof of surgery from a licensed veterinarian. \n\nThese puppies are so sweet and they are absolutely adorable!! They love everyone they meet, especially children! Each sweet baby is ready for their new loving forever home!\n\nOur adoption process includes an application, a meeting/play date with your future fur baby, a brief home visit, and an adoption fee. Our adoption fees are in place to offset veterinary costs (spaying, neutering, vaccines, deworming, and microchipping) and to ensure our dogs will not be used for dog fighting or any other malicious purposes.",

He is neutered, up to date on vaccinations, heartworm/lymes negative, flea treated, wormed, and microchipped. Neo is working on obedience training. He knows some commands, but training will need to continue after adoption. He is very smart and should learn quickly. Neo loves playing fetch and hiking with him person. He gets along with other dogs but has never lived with one. He did live with 2 cats and did well with them. Neo does not do well with children. Neo is timid and can be fearful when he first meets people. He needs a little bit of time to warm up, then he will be your best friend. If you are interested in adopting Neo, please complete an application. ** Applications will not be screened if they do not meet the listed requirements.**",

Zeus was found running around all by himself and in pretty bad shape. He was covered in fleas and had some fur loss. He was also really skinny. He's been gaining weight, and his fur is growing back. He's looking for a family of his very own to love. He does great with kids and with dogs. He also does well with kitties with proper introductions.\nIf you've been looking for a very sweet and loving boy to add to your family, please consider Zeus.\n\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION: www.tinyurl.com/IADRAdoptionApp\n\nIf you'd like to help Zeus while he searches for his very own family, you can sponsor him for only $19/month here: https://petbucks.org/pet/6214/sponsor/create\n\n\n***IMPORTANT- PLEASE READ***\nThe State of Texas requires rescues to collect sales tax on any adoption fees. Our adoption fee is $175. Texas State Sales Tax will be added to that amount.\n\nDue to the nature of our adoption process, our fosters are usually only able to consider potential adopters within the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. A vet reference is required, and a trial period will be completed before finalizing the adoption. Thank you for your understanding.",

She is a HUGE cuddler and wants nothing more than to be around her humans 24/7. Lady is still a little nervous that when her humans leave they might not come back for her, so she needs someone who is willing to put in the time and energy to lessen her separation anxiety. Lady responds VERY well to positive reinforcement, and she gets nervous at aggressive behaviors like scolding and raising your voice. Her new family needs to be willing to be patient and gentle with her. She is a puppy, so she has a lot of energy and loves to play. Squeaky toys and bones are some of her favorite things. A fenced-in backyard with room to run would be encouraged.\n\nIf interested, please\ncomplete the\nAdoption Application\non our website at\nwww.NeedyPaws.org\nand we will contact you.\nAdopters must live within an hour's drive of St. Louis, MO.\n\nOur $250 adoption fee includes up-to-date vaccinations, heartworm testing and preventative, spay/neuter and microchip.\n\nWe are a 100% foster-based rescue and all of our dogs live in approved foster homes. We are dedicated to finding the best Forever Homes, and will perform home visits and conduct veterinarian and reference checks for each potential adopter.",

This sweet girl found herself at a local municipal shelter after living in poor conditions with an owner who treated his animals not as family, but as disposable property. She spent over a year at the shelter waiting to find her home. We recently rescued her, knowing we would be able to find her an amazing, loving home! Lil Mama is about 5 years old and is looking for a calm, quiet home. She weights around 65lbs and walks great on leash. She would prefer a home where she can be spoiled as the only dog. She would do best in a home with older children, if any. If you are interested in this Lil Mama, apply today.",

My foster mom is also happy to report her cat and I have become best friends. I love cuddling with him, but he never wants to rough house with me, so I have to play with my toys instead. I am still new to other dogs so I don't always know how to make friends or be comfortable. My new home would ideally just understand I am young and be patient while teaching me all these things. It will be a whole lot of fun growing old with you!\n\nAge: 1 year\nBreed: Pit Bull Terrier Mix\nNeutered: No \nAdoption Fee: $200.00\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Buddha please email foster@cofpets.com.",

Submit an application from our website and then make an appointment to meet him.\n\nMaxwell is not eligible for foster and will be a straight adoption. \n\nAge: ~9 years old\nWeight: ~19lbs\nHousebroken: Yes\nCrate trained: He has been left alone for brief periods of time in a sectioned off area (kitchen). He will take some time to settle.\nDog sociability: Maxwell lives with other dogs in his foster home and has done well, but he prefers slow intros to new friends. On walks, he is leash reactive and will bark/lunge at other dogs on walks. He is improving with training, but his adopter will want to continue to work on this!\nCat sociability: Not a match \nKids: Unknown, but shy/fearful so older kids only\nIdeal home: Maxwell is looking for a home that is comfortable to take things slow with him as he warms up over time (with lots of high value snacks!) He prefers a quiet neighborhood so he doesn't have to pass by a bunch of other dogs or people while out on their walks as he can be leash reactive (barks/lunges).\n\nMaxwell may be the sweetest boy you'll ever meet. If his soulful brown eyes don't win you over, his gentle and cuddly demeanor certainly will. He's a calm boy who wants nothing more than to snuggle up into a fuzzy blanket with you and nap the day away. He is a big fan of medium-length walks, or wandering around a park at his own pace. He's a bit shy with new people but opens up quickly if they give him some affection. He has done great meeting new people in his foster's backyard but can be a little nervous of new folks if he is out on a walk. He won't say no to treats, but will get most excited if you scratch him on the bridge of his nose. He may sound too good to be true, but I assure you he is real and ready to find his forever home! \n\nMaxwell is well-behaved, sweet-natured and smart, and with enough hot dogs you could certainly teach this older dog some new tricks! \n\nMaxwell's adoption fee is 150. He is neutered, up to date on core vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative.\n\n***We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications. We ask that you please be patient and someone will be in touch via email within 72 hours. Please do not email us unless you have not received a response in 72 hours. Please only fill out one adoption application. ***",

Red Collar took all 3 dogs in; we think they are probably related.  We named these other dogs Crackers and Ritz.  They are also available for adoption, so please check them out too!  \n\nRitz is a shy girl and will do best in a home with another dog of a similar size.  She currently loves to cuddle up and sleep next to Crackers!   Ritz is living in a foster home, and is leash trained and crate trained.  She's working on potty training.   Ritz loves getting petted and being brushed, and of course treats!\nDue to her shy nature she will need a family who will be patient and give her time to gain her confidence.\n\nFor more information please e-mail info@redcollar.org.\nAdoption applications can be submitted on our website, redcollar.org.  \n\nAge - 1 year\nWeight - 27 lbs.\nDogs - okay\nCats - unknown\nKids - too shy to be around little kids, older kids may be okay.\nVaccinated - yes\nSpayed - yes\nMicrochipped - yes\n\n",

She\u2019s very sweet, loves to cuddle, and is a good kisser until she gets overexcited -- then watch your nose! Her foster family is working on her puppy nibbling by offering a toy instead. She catches on fast!\n\nShe is doing well learning to walk with harness and leash; she stays close in with a slight pull. She loves toys and plays by herself quite well. So far she has not chewed up anything. All stuffed toys are still intact. She is almost house trained and learned to use the dog door on the second time through. She is healthy and eats enthusiastically. She is also crate trained and sleeps in the crate at night.\n\nIn her foster home, she does not back down from the older, resident dog even after being warned and nipped a few times. She will probably do best in a home with a younger, playful dog. At a recent puppy social, she picked out the biggest puppy for a play buddy; an hour of hard play barely wore her out. \nShe is starting to herd and will need to learn not to herd people as she would herd sheep.\n\nShe is four months old and has had her first round of vaccines, including rabies. She will get the second round on Feb. 15.\n\nThe ideal adopter will be eager to enroll Paiton in puppy class and will lose no time in introducing her to the big wide world.  She is still in the \u201csocialization period,\u201d and she is growing up fast.  Paiton will thrive with an owner who takes her education seriously and is committed to positive dog training methods. If you\u2019re ready for some excitement and affection in your life, Paiton may be your dog!\n\nPaiton\u2019s adoption fee includes spay/neuter, basic vaccinations, rabies vaccination, and heartworm tested negative.\n\nYou can find her application here:\n\nhttps://forms.gle/5eSBjHrWv7pTEEzUA\n\nQuestions? Contact us at connellpetrescue@gmail.com \n\nThank you! And Paiton thanks you!\n\n",

I was found the next morning by the 'office dog'. I am estimated to be 15 years old & I have both vision & hearing issues (Okay my hearing may actually be more selective than anything but I'll never tell). I am a VERY opinionated lady & will bark to let you know when I want you for something (to feed me or put me into the bed especially). I do have chronic dry eye & require daily medication for that. I have had a complete dental & have no teeth (only had 1 to begin with). My vet checked my heart & lungs and said they are both great. I am housetrained & I prefer to sleep with you in the bed. I like the other dogs & don't mind the cats. I however am not sure what I think about kids so the rescue recommends that there are no children in my forever home. I am spayed, HW-, UTD on all my shots, current on deworming & flea medication & regularly groomed. All I need is my very own home.Steps for adoption:Submit pre-adoption application found on our website (www.lostfantasystables.org)Application is reviewed & references contactedHome visit (by Zoom or in person)Meet & GreetSign adoption contract",

Daphne is sweet girl that gets along well with people, kids and other dogs, but prefers not to live with Bossy dogs. Daphne is doing great in her foster home. Loves her walks, her people, children and calm dog siblings. Daphne appears to be house trained and leash trained and is learning more skills every day. Daphne needs entropion surgery on her eyes as her eyelashes grow the wrong way and irritate her eyes. This surgery is covered by the rescue and is a rather common surgery for dogs. If you think Daphne might be the right dog for your family, Email dogs@labradorsandfriends.org or fill out our online application at www.labradorsandfriends.org Daphne is located in Southern California.",

He is also a smarty and knows sit, down, and loose leash walking. Biscotti's kryptonite is other dogs, so he does best walking when there aren't a lot of other doggos around. He has spent time in a home and was described as being cuddly, affectionate, a mix of energetic and couch potato. When out and about, he greeted strangers and children politely. Biscotti likes going for car rides, walks, and runs. He is also a \"leaner,\" so be prepared for snuggles! If you are interested in meeting Biscotti go to la.bestfriends.org/adopt and fill out our Dog Adoption Survey and our team will reach out to you! 2/2/21 5:06 PM",

Cali loves snuggling, getting pets, and treats. She is house trained, does well when left on her own, and is very gentle and easy going. She has done well with adults and kids with no signs of resource guarding. Her ideal home would be in a quiet area and would do especially well in a home with fenced outdoor space. If you are looking for a low-key cuddle buddy with great manners, Cali is the the dog for you!If you are interested in meeting Cali, go to la.bestfriends.org/adopt and fill out our Dog Adoption Survey and our team will reach out to you!",

Ariel will need to be the only dog as she does not enjoy sharing her people. She will need a home that any children are 12 years of age and older. Before coming to us Ariel had a large mass removed from her back. Luckily it was benign so no need to worry. She is still sensitive in that area and she does not appreciate being picked up at the moment. Ideally Ariel will need a quiet, patient home with no other animals, who will allow her to take her time to get to know them. if she sounds like the one and only for you, then please ask to meet Ariel today.",

This pretty lady was rescued from a high kill shelter after her elderly owner was no longer able to care for her. Martha is a total sweetheart!! She's very affectionate and wants nothing more than a warm lap where she can spend most of her day. Martha has a happy-go-lucky personality and makes friends with everyone she meets! She loves to be with her people and is happiest when she's snuggled up in bed or cuddling on the couch. Martha has been good with other dogs and didn't seem to mind the cats she met! She is very well mannered and even seems to be housebroken. We just love this adorable girl and know she will make a wonderful companion for the person willing to give her the time and attention she deserves! Please help us find Martha the amazing forever home she's been dreaming of! \n\nInterested in adopting?

I love being outside and am good on a leash. Since I'm heartworm positive, my activity is limited for awhile until I complete my treatment, and AHS is helping with that. At that point, I'll be ready to run and play with you anytime! Sit on a bench and I'll climb up on your for some loving and a face rub. I'm a little overweight so exercise will be good for me. I don't have much known history with dogs, cats, or kids, but would love to meet your current dog or children to see if we'd get along! I'm a sweet boy and hope you will take a \"chance\" on me!! I look forward to meeting you soon. Love, Chance",

Rocky is a 5 month old puppy who will need a lot of training, socialization, and plenty of TLC in order to make sure he turns into the best adult dog he could be! Rocky will need to meet any children living in the home. He can be kind of mouthy when playing, but redirection with toys can help Rocky learn to not use clothes and hands as a chew toy. Rocky has some medical concerns that his adopters will need to be comfortable taking on.\n\n\n\nRocky is currently living in one of our wonderful foster homes. Adopting from foster is easy! Please email adoptions@hshv.org or call (734)662-5585 to arrange to meet Rocky today!",

Kitty has taken awhile to trust us here, but he has come a long way. Kitty is still unsure with overhandling, so he will need a hands off approach until he is totally comfortable in a new home. Because of his nervousness, and trust issues, he needs to go into a home with no children under 17 years of age. Due to his size and breed, he cannot live in an apartment or condo setting. He would LOVE a back yard where he can run and play! Kitty enjoys being the center of attention and would do best in a home with no other pets. He may get along with another dog, as long as it is a female. if you have a female dog at home, he would need to meet her prior to adoption to see if they want to be friends. Kitty really is a good boy, he just needs a chance. If you are willing to give him the time he needs to feel fully confident, we hope you will adopt him today!",

In new, uncertain situations, I tend to shut down/hide/cower if I don't know what's going on-like meeting new people who make me nervous. I've settled nicely into my foster home, and my foster Mom says I am a sweet, gentle, obedient lovable guy who is eager to please! I'm housebroken and have great leash manners. I have the softest, speckled ears and loving having them scratched and my neck rubbed. I'll ask for more petting by nosing my head into your lap for cuddling and will follow you around all day--just in case you need me for anything! . I'm a quiet guy who would prefer a quiet, calm home where I can chill out during the day. I'll be the kindest and most rewarding addition to a home that's willing to be patient with me while I learn the routines. If you are looking for a sweet and calm companion to share your home, I want to meet you. I'll be watching for you!\n Love, WT",

Most things startle me, and since I'm still young, I'm adjusting to the world. I need a human who can love me and build my confidence up in a consistent and patient manner. I'm most likely a flight risk, so you should wait until I'm less scared of the world before letting me hang out outside off leash. I may also do best as the only dog in the house, that is unless you have a calm, older, large breed dog who could show me the ropes! Do you think you could water this wallflower? Love, Elsie\n\nI qualify for Foster First, which means you can foster me for 14 days prior to adoption to ensure I'm the perfect fit for your family!",

            "description": "Located outside of Atlanta, GA: **Bella baby is looking for a forever home to live out her golden years!** She might be 7-8 years old, but she is still full of life and full of love. She prefers spending her days lounging around, sun bathing, sleeping-in and being covered by her blankies (she hates being cold!). While she\u2019s still learning how to play, she does enjoy running in the backyard with her foster mom.\n\nShe is the epitome of a gentle giant and rarely barks. In typical Dane fashion, she is a leaner and prefers being with her people and to be loved. She is not a fan of being left alone, but is not destructive. She would do best in a home with owners who are home more often than not. She would also do best in a home without young children (she startles if woken suddenly). \n\nShe has other dog and cat foster siblings and has done very well with them. If they get too close to her food, she will give a warning growl, but hey, we don\u2019t like people getting close to our food either. The only time she shows interest in cats is if they\u2019re running in the yard; other than that, you can find Bella curled up next to them. She does well on a leash and will signal when she needs to go potty. \n\nSince Bella is considered a senior (despite how she feels mentally), she does have certain age related needs that will be considered when placing her in a forever home. Her blood work looked phenomenal despite being underweight. She has gained a few pounds since coming to us, but could stand to gain a few more even though she will always need to be kept lean. She can be a picky eater in the morning, but seems to get her appetite throughout the day. \n\nX-rays showed spondylosis (spine) and arthritis of the hips. The vet thinks this is normal aging and there isn\u2019t much more she would recommend beyond supplements. She is a bit wobbly on her feet so she will need a home with extremely limited stairs. Rugs and carpets are her best friend, but we bought her some booties to help on hard wood. \n\nBella is an absolute sweetheart and anyone would be lucky to welcome this mature lady into their lives. She is spayed, UTD on vaccines, prevention and heartworm negative.\n\nTo fill out an application, please review our FAQ on our website FIRST before filling out an application at www.risingabovegdf.org/\n\n**If you do not meet our requirements, your application will not be processed. Please read the FAQ first.**",

He is a playful guy and loves going for walks. He's very gentle and loves to snuggle.\n\nInterested adopters can fill out an application at canehavenrescue.com. \nAny possible questions about Silo, please email canehavenrescue@gmail.com \n\nCane Haven Rescue will transport any of their adoptable dogs to the right home. We do require adoption fees that are based on the age & health status of the adoptable dog. The adoption fee covers every single dog in CHR with vaccinations, heartworm test, deworming, microchip, spay/neuter & medications. All CHR adoptable dogs are current on their monthly  heartworm and flea medication. A CHR representative will do a home check to ensure the pets are placed in a secure and loving home. \n\nwww.canehavenrescue.com",

He is a playful guy and loves going for walks. He loves to snuggle as well.\n\nInterested adopters can fill out an application at canehavenrescue.com. \nAny possible questions about Jett, please email canehavenrescue@gmail.com \n\nCane Haven Rescue will transport any of their adoptable dogs to the right home. We do require adoption fees that are based on the age & health status of the adoptable dog. The adoption fee covers every single dog in CHR with vaccinations, heartworm test, deworming, microchip, spay/neuter & medications. All CHR adoptable dogs are current on their monthly  heartworm and flea medication. A CHR representative will do a home check to ensure the pets are placed in a secure and loving home. \n\nwww.canehavenrescue.com",

            "description": "Bolt is a 2 year old Retriever mix who is looking for a new leash on life! He was brought to the shelter by his previous owners, who's schedule didn't allow them enough time to work with him, but he also wasn't getting along with the cats in the home. Bolt is a very loving, playful, active, and protective fellow, and would be best in a home with experienced dog owners. While he was great with the kids in his previous home, he could get protective over them when friends would come over, so we recommend a home where there won't be lots of new people coming and going. Bolt has shown to have a high prey-drive, and should be the only animal in the home. He was used to being crated in the home when alone and loves going on walks. Bolt has shown severe food aggression, so we would recommend feeding him in a crate or room where he can be alone until he is done eating. He knows some basic commands, and will work for treats! Bolt knows there is the right home out there, and can't wait to show off for you. Once this beautiful boy knows you, you'll get to see just how sweet and goofy he is at heart! Bolt is neutered, current on his vaccinations, heartworm negative, and microchipped. All he needs now is you! He is available for adoption at the Benbrook Waggin' Tails Adoption Center, open every day from 12-6 pm by appointment!\n\nCall us today at 817-249-3647 to schedule an appointment to meet Bolt!\n",

Little Harvey had a rough start in this world but is thriving with his foster family. You see Harvey was found lying on a couch on the side of the road. His brother had already passed and he was very thin. His foster mom couldn't leave him there so she took him home which saved his life because it turned out he had Parvo. She had him treated and little guy pulled through like a champ!! He is a sweet, loving and very intelligent boy. He loves other dogs and does great with humans big and small. Not sure how is he is with kitties yet. Harvey is VERY active so will need a family who will play outside with him, take him for runs, hiking whatever it takes. He will also need a fenced yard.\n\nCrate-trained, housebroken\n\nHe is less than a year old and approximately 20lbs and should top out around 28lbs. Harvey is neutered, up-to-date on vaccinations, heartworm negative and has had a 6-month proheart injection. His fee is 100.00 and apps can be found at www.tireddogrescue.com",

The first two pictures of Bradley laying down was how he actually began his journey into the LAF family. You see, Bradley, who had no name at the time, was lost and happened upon a bed and some water at a camp ground. As luck would have it, the site he found belonged to one of our amazing volunteers! This sweet, skinny boy found a warm spot to lay his tired, beaten up body. To ensure no one lost him at the camp site prior we had our volunteer surrender him to the Friends of Lake Elsinore Shelter, put her name down for adoption/finder, and we had him wait his mandatory stray hold. Sadly, no one came for him, so we immediately got him out of the shelter and to our vet. Bradley had a lump on his neck that was hard and concerning, we had it removed while he was being neutered and sent it out for pathology. We are still waiting for the report to come back and we are hoping it is nothing serious. Bradley is a kind, gentle boy who loves everyone. He just wants to be loved and we really want to get him into a loving home ASAP!\n\nIf you would like to help donate towards Bradley's medical care you can do so via:\n\nFacebook: the button on the post\n\nVenmo: @labradorsandfriends\n\nPayPal: labradorsandfriends@yahoo.com\n\nWebsite:\nwww.labradorsandfriends.org\n\nCash/Check in the mail: Labradors and Friends - 2307 Fenton Parkway #107-160, San Diego, CA 92108\n\nTax ID#32-0195297\n\nBradley is located in Southern California...to apply to foster/adopt please visit our website\nwww.labradorsandfriends.org\nyou won't regret opening your home and heart to this very special boy!!",

I'm always waggin' my tail so hard my whole body moves, I dart around at super mega lightning speed like you couldn't even imagine, & I'm always on the GO GO GO!!! I'm always playing any chance I get, & any time I'm not, I'm cuddlin' up right into your lap & up in your face. I LOVE toys, especially tennis balls! It might stem from me trying to replace the ones of my own that I lost? Maybe, but what's done is done I guess! I might love them a little TOO much, honestly. They usually don't last more than 10 minutes or so before they're in pieces! I'm kind of a rascal like that. I guess you could say I'm like half dog, half pig. I'm all short & stocky & I snort like one, for sure! & I've got the colors of a cow? Like what the HECK am I!? Sorry for the foul language there. Having a bit of an existential crisis here! Anyway, what was I talking about? I forgot...hmm...\nOh, hi there! My name is Finnley! What? We already went over that part? Never mind, sorry! I just got lost in the beautiful eyes of yours. Anyway, come take me home, why don't ya!? I know you're dyin' to have a little stud man like me around!\n\nI'm up to date on shots, neutered, chipped, & ready to go! I also tested negative for heartworm. If you're looking for a stocky, stubby guy to add to your family, come check me out sometime!",

The current adoption fee is $75 which includes the dogs spay or neuter and Rabies vaccination at a local vet, and covers the distemper/parvo vaccine and bordetella vaccine and dewormings it receives here at our shelter. No dog will leave the shelter to an adopter without being vetted first. \n\nBy TN state law stray dogs are held for 3 days so they can be found by their owners before being put up for adoption or rescue. A dog found as a stray wearing a collar is held for 5 days before it is put up for adoption or rescue. Our shelter is a first come first adopt/rescue facility.There are no holds placed on dogs for potential adopters/rescue, however if a party is interested in a particular dog before it becomes available they may send an inquiry to shelter.manager@lewisburgtn.gov and those inquiries will be kept track of in order of received once dog becomes available. Adopters/rescues will be notified what order they are in in regards to each dog. They are available at 8am on the day they are available. Non vetted dogs will have an appointment scheduled and will be available for pickup for adoption the day after their surgery. Approved rescues may pull a dog and have vetted at their own expense once available to the public.",

Don't get me wrong, we will have a lot of fun in the meantime but I will need time to understand what's expected of me. I will need help on all those fun puppy things like house training and basic obedience. I want to learn everything I possibly can. I am pretty excited about life and doing new things! My goal is to be your lifelong companion and I should learn quickly with praise, treats and little patience. I'd really love for us to get enrolled in training classes, after all school is the best way to get us both educated on what it takes to raise a puppy! It will be fun to watch me as I'm learning, after all puppies can be pretty silly. If you're ready to take on all the fun and companionship, come on out to Wayside Waifs today!\n ...",

While Lucy loves men if they are on the couch with her, she is timid and skittish around men when they are standing and moving about however, she is not aggressive just scared.\nThe best home for her will be one with a woman/women who will love her and in a family situation will need a man who has a lot of love and patience. He would need to understand and be willing to work with her to gain her trust. Here in her foster home she loves to cuddle on the couch with her foster Dad and after a few weeks he is now worth trusting for a great breakfast.\nLucy will need work on walking on a leash so a home with a fenced in yard, no cats, and lots of love for this beauty is the best for Lucy.\nWith her foster Mom she is a buddy and follows her around, gives gentle kisses and ear nibbles and loves to be loved. Lucy also loves the other dogs and plays with the small and big ones alike. She has met the grandkids at her foster home and she is fine.\nIf you are a true dog lover and lover of the breed and you will make Lucy your focus and not expect her to hurry up and love everyone then you will be the right forever home for her. She needs loving hands and some positive reinforcement training for walking. Lucy is not crate trained but she is fully house trained and has not had one single accident in her foster home.\nLucy is being fostered in Walnutport, PA.Application Fees, Adoption Donations and Rescue Policy: Please know that 100% of our funds are used for rescuing the dogs.\nOur rescue policy requires the following:\n\nAdopters must have their primary residence in one of the following states: Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, and parts of North Carolina and parts of New York.\nWe will not adopt a giant breed dog to homes where the dog will have access to highly varnished hardwood steps inside the home. Any inside steps to which the dog(s) have access, must have carpeting, securely fixed stair treads, or a non-skid surface.

He would do best in a quiet home with older kids who understand that he needs space and time to get to know you. Once he\u2019s comfortable, he\u2019s a great lap dog who enjoys sitting with you on the couch. His one-floppy ear gives him an endearing and inquisitive look.

He has a very sweet disposition and gets along with people, kids, dogs and cats.\n\nIf you would like an application go to our website (https://humanesocietypc.com/) and download one and email it back as a Word or PDF document. Please no Google documents.\n\nDue to the expected number of applications, please refrain from calling the shelter to check on your application. The successful applicants will be notified, but please keep an eye on our Facebook and Petfinder pages where the pups will be posted as adopted when it happens. Also please keep in mind that there will be many great applications and if you are not chosen, it does not mean that you were denied or that your application was bad.  It simply means we did not have enough puppies to go around to everyone. Also keep in mind that it never hurts to try!\n\nThis dog's adoption fee is $225.

He had been there for many days, the construction crew was setting out food and water for him.  A person got him safe into boarding, however, he remained there for many months, until he was abandoned.  He is now in a foster home.   \n\n \n\nTyson is a sweet boy who loves loves loves to play catch.  He is very good with people and hangs out well with other dogs.  He should not be in a home with cats, though.  He is kennel trained, hangs out in his kennel all day just fine.  He does amazing on walks \u2013 when the leash is tugged, he stops and sits (learned this in his previous life).  Tyson is a big boy with lots of love to give. \n\n \n\nHis adoption fee is $200.  For more info about Tyson, contact his foster Sharon at sharon.c.epstein@gmail.com\n\n \n\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!\n\n",

She is an indoor dog, she goes out to potty when asked  \u201cWant to go outside\u201d? She will also sit by the door to let you know it\u2019s time to go out. She loves to patrol around the back yard, so a home with a securely fenced yard is a MUST! She needs a new loving home because sadly her owner just passed away. She was his protector and best friend. She was used to being by his side 24/7 and she needs a new owner that will be with her most of the time. Her ideal home is as an ONLY DOG! No cats, she will chase them and no small children, as she isn\u2019t used to them. Due to breed and size restrictions in rental property, homeowners only need apply! Breed savvy is a PLUS. She is spayed, microchipped and up to date on vaccinations. She is an inside the house only dog with outside potty and play privileges.  Are you ready to have this sweet girl by your side?

Jonathan was surrendered to The Humane Society of Mississippi by his owner who did not want to give him up but was too sick to care for him. He was not in the best of shape but thanks to HSSM treating his skin and eyes he is on his way to looking and feeling better!! Johnathan has already been neutered and is still taking meds to clear up his skin some more and eye help with his eye issues.\n\nHe hasn't been around any cats yet, but he is great with other dogs and people. Jonathan is pretty mellow and enjoys being close to people. He is partly house trained and scheduled for a dental on March 2nd.He would do well in a family with older children, who would treat him with the love a senior deserves.\n\nJonathan is long and low, and currently a bit on the thin side, but we are working on getting him to a healthy weight.\n\nJohnathan's fee is 125.00 and apps can be found at www.tireddogrescue.com",

He loves toys, food, and cuddles. Hank has bursts of energy where he loves to run and play and then he is happy to curl up and sleep in his bed. He is known to sleep in in the morning and often snores, so beware!\n\n Hank gets along with everyone (dogs, cats, kids, men, women). He doesn't realize his size and thinks he is a lap dog so he will sometimes crawl in your lap for cuddles. \n\nHank is housebroken and crate trained although we never crate him because he is so well behaved. He never has accidents and doesn't chew on anything. He does well on leash and enjoys car rides! He also knows sit and shake! \n\nHank is up to date on vaccines, microchipped and neutered. He is a little hard of hearing but otherwise in great health. He just had bloodwork done which came back normal and had a dental so he is ready to go for awhile. \n\nIf you'd like to meet this awesome dude, submit an application on our website at www.dominoeffectanimalrescue.org",

            "description": "Hi, my name is Tiara! I'm a 3 year old female beauty. They say I'm one of the sweetest, most loving German Shepherds you'll ever meet... to my people! I need slow introductions to new people though and to keep socializing. I'm thankful that MDRN got me out of the shelter where my former family left me, and have given me this 2nd chance. I'm crate trained and housebroken. I'm a great watchdog and I love attention. I also love food. I can only have a certain kind or my stomach hurts... So even though I want everything, I can only have my food and pancreatic enzymes to go with it due to my pancreatic insufficiency (EPI). I wait by the door until my foster mama gets home. Like most GSDs, I'm pretty loyal to my person. I do not mind the cats or the other dogs. The kids are great and take me outside to play with me. Although I will miss my foster family briefly, I will quickly bond with a new fam. I'm spayed, fully vetted and vaccinated, microchipped, and ready for my forever family!!!\nTo help pay for vet bills and care (transportation, food, toys, etc..) a $300 donation is requested at the time of adoption. All of our adoptions are contingent upon an approved application, home visit, reference check, obedience training agreement, and signing of adoption contract. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, and microchipped before adoption. Our dogs are companion animals that live indoors as part of your family. Please do not apply if your plan is to have them as outside dogs, garage dogs, porch dogs or outside kennel dogs. We do not ship dogs. All of our dogs are in private foster homes. We are not a shelter with hours. A visit can be arranaged after an adoption questionnaire has been filled out and sent in. Please try email first. We are all volunteers that work so we can not easily take or make phone calls.",

Due to the current regulations set forth by Governor Pritzker on group gatherings we will not be having adoption events until further notice. As an all foster based rescue this means that all meets will be by appointment only. Your whole family must be available to attend the meet as there will be no second meets scheduled to help limit contact between our team and the public. To help streamline the process please make sure your current pets are up to date, you have landlord/HOA approval, and that you are prepared to take the dog home with you immediately before submitting an application. Thank you & Please stay safe!***\n\nNetwork to us from a rescue partner in the south Bumble just arrived. Approximately 11mos old and super cute! She is approximately 35lbs and is almost full grown at that size. Since she just arrived we are still getting to know her. Check back for more information and possible restrictions once she fully settles into foster care.\n\nIf you are interested in adoption, please complete the Application to Adopt which you can find on our website (\nwww.magnificentmutts.org\n) No phone calls please. Emails only.\n\nAdoption Donation $300 (cash only)\n\nPlease visit www.magnificentmutts.org for the online dog or cat application.\n\nAdoption Fees*\n\nAdult cats starting at $125, Kittens starting at $165.\nDogs/Puppies starting at $225 minimum\nPrices subject to change, please contact for specific adoption donations.",

She was able to raise her last two babies and then 6 orphaned puppies needed her.  The puppies lost their mother when they were 2 1/2 weeks old and needed a surrogate.  Lilabelle immediately took to them and was able to nurse them until they were old enough to be on their own.  Lilabelle has the sweetest personality and loves people and kids. She loves attention and will always be your best friend.  She does fine with the other dogs here and occasionally has to be reminded that the cats don't want to be her playmate.

Sitting around the house is definitely not for me. But I certainly do appreciate a nice long nap after a good hard run. And while we're inside, I definitely would be the life of the party. If you're into training, you could teach me all kinds of party tricks to have fun and amaze your friends. So if you're looking for a really sweet dog with LOTS of energy, then let's get out of here and get this party started!!!",

A: I'm a bit of shy pup, so perhaps a chill day on the sofa snuggling or letting you pet me all day would be perfect and help me warm up to you! Q: What are you looking forward to most when you find a forever home? A: Someone who will love me unconditionally, have lots of patience, and assure me they will always be there for me because that's how I plan to love my companion too!",

            "description": "I AM ON HOLD PENDING AN ADOPTION APPOINTMENT. Taylor is a handsome 9-month-old mixed-breed fellow who currently weighs about 62 pounds although since he still has some growing to do he may weigh 75-80 as an adult. He came to SFAS when his guardian could no longer care for him and he is now ready for a new family. Here at the shelter, Taylor has been very friendly and enjoys playing. Taylor's adoption fee has been paid for by a guardian angel through March 1st 2021. He is neutered and microchipped and has age-appropriate vaccinations. A licensing/microchip fee may apply. To meet Taylor or to be added to his waitlist, call (505) 983-4309 x 1610 and leave a voicemail message that includes the DOG'S NAME, plus YOUR NAME and A PHONE NUMBER - OR e-mail this information to adoption@sfhumanesociety.org. A scheduler will call you back within 48 hours to confirm your request. If you have other dogs at home, tell the scheduler you would like to bring them along for a Meet n' Greet. SFAS offers a variety of excellent training classes, seminars and Trainer Talks led by animal behavior professionals. These are $50 off for animals adopted from any shelter or rescue group! Due to current COVID-19 restrictions, classes and talks are all presented virtually using Zoom. For course descriptions, schedules and registration, visit https://sfhumanesociety.org/our-programs/behavior-training/group-training-classes/ for classes and https://sfhumanesociety.org/our-programs/behavior-training/special-seminars-and-workshops/ for seminars and Trainer Talks.",

Well I love the dog version of those things, like puzzle feeders, Kongs, and other activities and toys that work my brain activities. Do you enjoy running or hiking or any other fun activities? I would love to go with you to get my workout in as well! If you have an active home, then I'm the energetic canine companion for you! I really like to talk when alone, sometimes even when I have company. I'm not sure apartment neighbors will appreciate me being a chatty Cathy. I need to meet any children and dogs in the home to make sure it's a perfect match. Theo will be shown by appointment only.

I have been at the shelter since Jan 20, 2021. Meet Gwen! This little wiggle-butt came to the shelter as a stray so shelter staff and volunteers are still getting to know her. Personality: Gwen is a people pibble who loves to make new friends! She is ready to make a home in your heart and on your couch! History: Her history with other dogs, cats, and small animals is unknown, however, she has shown some reactivity while here. We always recommend slow and careful introductions! Energy levels: Gwen is a young girl is sweet as pie, with a good amount of energy, but is dealing with a bit of a medical issue, due to a Luxating Patellas (3 out of 4). Ideal home: Gwen would prefer a home with minimal stairs, as her knee does cause some discomfort. Family: She needs a family that is looking for a lovebug! Children in the home should be old enough to respect her space and understand her medical needs. Is there no doubt, she`s the one for you? Come down and meet her today!",

She has been to the dog parks but we don't recommend you take her to one until you are familiar with each other. She has lived with other dogs and children and is reported to be housebroken to a doggie door. Lana came in with 1156771 Archer as a surrender due to owner becoming homeless.",

Ginger has been pretty shy here at the shelter but might just need some extra time to warm up to her new people. Her previous owner stated that she's very outgoing, friendly, and affectionate! She has spent her time both living indoors and outdoors. She is said to be skijor and mushing trained! Ginger would benefit from a basic obedience class to learn how to be a proper lady in society as she still needs to learn basic commands like sit. She will also need work on being housebroken! Ginger is a young girl who just needs someone to put a little extra love, time, and training into her! Ginger is said to do well with other dogs but we do not know how she does with cats, pocket pets, and livestock. Being that she is an Alaskan Husky and they have a higher prey drive it might be best for her to go to a home without smaller pets. If you are wanting to try and introduce her to them just make sure to do it in a safe and controlled environment. If this girl looks like the pup you've been waiting for to make your family complete please give the shelter a call!",
