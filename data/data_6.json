He leaves Houston on 2/6 and arrives on the transport truck on 2/8!\n\nPlease fill out an application to be considered.\n\nWith any additional questions please email tiffany@threelittlepittiesrescue.org for more information on making Bryce part of your family!\n\nVideo: https://youtu.be/vCGXcuYL9TA",

            "description": "Rogue was found roaming with 2 other huskies, who we belive are his siblings. The finder brought them home and has done an incredible job of taking care of them and training them! We believe them to be between 1-2 years of age. \n\nRogue: is most likely the oldest and hes the leader of their little gang! He loves affection and isnt scared to paw at you when he isnt done being loved on. Gets very attached and wants to please! \n \n\nHere is some information their foster has shared about him and his siblings: \n\n\nAll dogs seem to have grown up together but are not bonded and can be adopted separately. They did better than I thought they would do getting baths as long as you go slow and talk to them! They did so great at the dog park. They are learning different ways to play (when they play together they are boys but my brothers female dog Lucy doesnt play rough) Did not seem to know basic commands but have been working on sit and off (jumping). They are required and successfully sit for 15-30 seconds (depending on my mood) before their food is placed in front of them for breakfast and dinner. Not food aggressive at all! As a matter of fact each dog will stop eating to show you attention if you ask them for it. I was able to put my hand in the bowl while they are each eating without fear. Individually each dog met my cats but completely supervised and controlled. Together they seem to want to play with my 10 year old cat and its just too much causing him to run and them to give chase. I have separate inside time between my cats and the dogs. We are doing much better about accidents in the home. The first week they had 4 plus accidents a day. Now have only had 2 accidents in the past 3 weeks. They (Rogue and Sammy) when left alone and bored they chew on whatever is lying around, definitely need a job to do or lots of fun toys or Kong's! Thankfully they do not constantly bark and dont bark at absolutely everything (park on other side of chain link fence where kids and other dogs walk) but are always alert. They love fetch and we are working on the returning part in the game of fetch.\n\nRogue would love to be part of any family and being a husky would like a family that is active or has a back yard for him to play in.\n\nHe is up to date on vaccines according to his age, has received proper deworming, and comes with additional dewormer. He is microchipped, neutered, comes with 6 months of preventatives, one month free trial of pet insurance, all of our animals receive a health certificate (this states a licensed veterinary saw the pet and deemed it healthy for travel, it is not a promise of perfect health.) Our transports are USDA certified and tfransport is included in adoption fee!\n\nHe is currently being fostered in Houston, Tx but will be traveling to the PNW 2/6/21.\n\nPlease inquire by submitting an application to mariah@threelittlepittiesrescue.org\n\nApplication link: https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/26842/generic",

He is an American Staffordshire Terrier mix and his momma is gorgeous! Folgers is estimated to weigh about 55 pounds when full grown. Him and his brother(now adopted) love to eat, sleep, play & repeat! We would love for Folgers to grow up in a home with other pup siblings so he can socialize as he grows! Since he is a pitty, we will mostly be looking at owned homes for this little guy! \n\n \n\nHe is up to date on vaccines according to age, has received proper deworming, and comes with additional dewormer if needed. This pet is microchipped, spayed/neutered, comes with 2-6 months of Heartworm preventative, and one month free trial of pet insurance if registered by adopter with insurance company. All animals receive a health certificate (stating that a licensed veterinarian saw the pet and deemed it healthy for travel, but is not a promise of perfect health.) Our transports are USDA certified and the cost of transport is included in adoption fee!\n\nHe is currently being fostered in Houston, TX but will be traveling to the PNW once adopted\n\nDue to the Covid-19 crisis we are experiencing a dramatic influx in inquiries and adoption applications. If you have questions regarding a pup you are interested in please fill out an adoption application. Once received it can take up to a week to complete our review. Be assured we have received your received your application! If you need more information regarding a pup you are interested in, the process of filling out an adoption application is still required prior to answering detailed questions. We value our potential adopters time and appreciate your patience as our staff navigate through the blessing of an overwhelming response for adoptions.\n\nPlease inquire by submitting an application to\n\n https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/30279/generic\n\nEmail sarah@threelittlepittiesrescue.org for any additional questions\n\nPlease go to our website to see more about our rescue and what we do! We are very proud of our hard work in saving as many animals as we can, giving them what they need, and matching them with the right families.",

She is a show stopper, friendly, active, and a lovable little one. She is full of playfulness and puppy energy! She is curious and a natural leader. She doesn't mind bubble baths and she wouldn't mind another brother or sister to play with. She enjoys other dogs big and small, she is very intelligent. She needs mental stimulation and daily exercise to keep this girl happy. She loves to play and she would fit in with an active household. She loves kids and she would be an amazing family pet. She would love to be with a family that enjoys hiking,running, or jogging. Puppies require a lot of patience and a lot of time to work with. She needs someone that is patient and kind. She is not completely potty trained since she is a baby still. She will need basic obedience and socialization right from the start. Puppies are a long-term commitment and we need to find families who are commited to training her. She is excited to meet her family in the PNW!\n\nShe is up to date on vaccines according to her age, she has received proper deworming, and comes with additional dewormer. She is microchipped, spayed, comes with 2-6 months of preventatives, one month free trial of pet insurance, all of our animals receive a health certificate (this states a licensed veterinary saw the pet and deemed it healthy for travel, it is not a promise of perfect health.) Our transports are USDA certified and tfransport is included in adoption fee!\n\nShe is currently being fostered in Houston, Tx but will be traveling to the PNW as soon as she finds her perfect home!\n\nemail violet@threelittlepittiesrescue.org for inquires and questions \n\nif you're interested, please apply here: \n\nhttps://petstablished.com/adoption_form/30285/generic",

Chloe was a little nervous when she first arrived, so it took a moment to win her over; it's possible that she may be the same way with other new people. Miss Chloe loves to shower you with affection. She gets the zoomies, jumps up an down (you may end up with some scratches on your arms, because she's just so excited to be with you), and loves life. Chloe likes toys, but it depends on the toy. She LOVES squeaky plush toys; the zoomies really come out then. Shar Pei's are an interesting breed, so make sure you do your homework. We think it would be best if she went to a home with older kids, 12 and older; other dogs are a possibility, we can have a meet and greet to see how they get along. Cats are also a possibility; Chloe didn't show much interest when we cat tested her, but we can always test her again if needed.",

Buddy is currently being fostered in Sumter County.\n\nIf you think youre the best friend to take care of Buddy, fill out the adoption application at www.PoodleandPoochRescue.org and well see if its a match.

            "description": "Ollie is an incredibly sweet and calm boy. He loves all humans, big and small, along with every pet we have encountered so far. Ollie loves a good game of tug-a-war with his rope followed by some relaxing and napping. If you're looking for a gentle, affectionate, little guy - Ollie is your guy!\n\nOllie's foster home includes three children and prior to that he was in a home with a cat. He is house broken and crate trained, and he understands basic commands such as \"stay\", \"off\", and \"come.\" Ollie is a hugger and will great you by going up on his hind legs and embracing you with his front paws while showing you all of his teeth and giving you the biggest doggy smile we have ever seen! \n\nBehavioral issues include begging for human food and sneaking into trash when accessible. Ollie is also very sensitive about his front paws being touched but has never shown aggression in trying to avoid it (note: he gets his paws wiped before entering the house regularly so he is getting used to them being touched). He needs to lose a little weight but he's working on that now!\n\nOur Adoption Process:\n\n\n\tMeet the Adoption Criteria. Before you do anything else, make sure you meet our adoption criteria. You must be at least 21 years old. You must live within a 60-mile radius of Richardson, Texas. You must share veterinary records for all pets currently in your home and all pets owned in the last five years. All pets in the home must be spayed or neutered. If you rent your home, you must provide verification that pets are allowed on the property. You must be willing to be interviewed by an adoption counselor and you must undergo an in person or virtual home visit from an RHS representative.\n\tComplete Application. https://www.petstablished.com/adoption_form/14314/generic\n\tPhone Interview. Compatible applicants will be forwarded to a counselor who will contact the applicant for a phone interview.\n\tHome Visit. If all the steps above are completed satisfactorily, we will set up a visit where you can meet the pet you are interested in. We will try to include the foster parent so you can learn more about how the pet is in a home environment.\n\tComplete Adoption. If all feel it is a good match, we will schedule the adoption at your home or an off-site location. The applicant will need to complete the adoption contract and pay the adoption fee. Our adoption fee is $250 for adult dogs, $300 for puppies (under 1 year) and $125 for cats. Discounts are available for senior-aged pets.",

I'm the sweetest boy who loves to give all the kisses! I love going on adventures that involve a car followed by lots of walks! I just love being wherever my human is! That includes being your sous chef in the kitchen or even lounging and watching my favorite movie, Shrek!\n\nI have shown to have some anxiety and constantly need to be reassured by my human that everything is OK; so a calm home would be ideal for me! I would prefer to be the only fur child in my forever home and children 10 years or older would be perfect! I am house trained and crate trained with the help of a frozen peanut butter Kong; I love peanut butter!! I would much rather not go into a crate because I'm such a good boy and just lay around until my foster mom comes home to play. I know sit, paw/shake, down and no. I'm working on stay, come, and inside voice. I also walk very well on a leash so long as another pesky critter isnt nearby; those squirrels are so squirrely!\n\nI am quite the perfect package and know Ill make the perfect addition to the prefect family!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting sweet Sam, apply to adopt at www.causeforcanines.org Adoption fee $250\nChildren must be 10 years old or older\nMust be an Ohio Resident at least 25 years old or older.",

However, he still lives up to his name and is a big lover!\n\nCupid may have escaped a backyard breeding situation when he was found wondering around Raleigh. After going through professional training, he was adopted out to a wonderful man who owned a boat. Him and his owner became inseparable and Cupid became a boat dog. Recently, his owner passed away very unexpectedly and Cupid has returned to his former fosters.\n\nHe is crate trained like a champ, is house trained, and knows commands such as sit, down, stay and crate. Cupid loves to play, and to play hard! He will need a fenced yard in his forever home. He has the energy that could keep up with a marathon runner but will snuggle up any chance he can get. Cupid just loves to be with his person and is extremely loyal. He gets along with his two foster doggy sisters and has been a huge hit when being out on the town.\n\nIf you're looking for a big-headed, goofy, energetic lover-- look no further! Cupid is your man!\n\nIf you are interested in this animal please start by filling out an adoption application at <a href=\"\"http://www.cfp-nc.org/adopt\"\">CFP-NC.org/adopt</a> and we will get in touch with you.",

            "description": "Jackson is estimated to be around a year old and is a pitbull/Great Dane mix. He is a little over 50lbs and is neutered and up to date on vaccines. He is very energetic and dog friendly but can play a little rough. Jackson is kid friendly. Hes been around a four year old and did good with him. He likes to chase cats, he hasnt hurt them but does chase them. He is house trained but will have an accident here and there if he isn't taken out often enough but with a structured schedule this shouldn't be an issue. \n\nOnce Jackson has all of his energy burnt out he is such a cuddle bug. He would love nothing more than to find a home where he can snuggle with his human. \n\nPlease apply at crossyourpaws.com if you are interested in giving him a forever home.\n\nIf you have an application on file- please message us on Facebook -do not email! \n\nWe are a 100% volunteer 501c3 and rely solely on donations of our supporters and volunteers. \n\n#SubaruLovesPets #KennyRossSubaru #cyprescue",

Im a 10 month old Border Collie mix and weigh about 65lbs. I have puppy energy at times and other times Im mellow and enjoy gnawing on a bone or being cuddled. Ive only been in Colorado a short bit but Im already learning the ropes. It wont take me long to get accustomed to my forever home. Im potty trained, crate trained and sleep all night. I need a bit more work on leash walking but Im doing well so far. I enjoy playing with the dogs in my foster home but kitties are fluffy toys to me so a home without cats is needed. As Im a big, strong guy a home with older kids 12+ is required as is a yard.

            "description": "Shadow is a shy guy. He was raised as a homebody and is not well-traveled. His first trip off of his property has been to the shelter and he isn't very impressed with his new surroundings. He's a sweet boy who is just so unsure of what to do now. He seems to be good with other dogs and we think with a little help from a patient person or family he would become quite the loving pup we believe he can be. His owner had to move to assisted living and unable to take him with him. He was loved very much by his owner, he lived in a home, and is house trained. Since his owner was older he is not well versed in walking on a leash, but he's learning. Shadow, lovingly nicknamed Eeyore by the staff, is a short & stocky guy, weighing in at 52 lbs at just under knee high. He has a body built like a Bassett hound including the knobby knees. He's a beautiful black brindle color. We were told he is 2 years old and has been made current on vaccines. Please consider adding this sweet, unique boy to your family. \n\nWe offer a 7 day foster-to-adopt program so you can see if Shadow fits into your family before committing to adoption. \n\nWe have no way to test for cat or other small animal compatibility. However, we do offer a 7 day foster-to-adopt program to those who live within an hour of Chillicothe, OH. This will allow you time to figure out if this dog is compatible for you. If not, simply bring the dog back and if it's a great fit you just come back and adopt. \n\nIf you are interested in one of our dogs please go to rosscountyhumanesociety.org and fill out the online application. Once approved we will contact you to schedule an appointment to meet the dog.RCHS does not conduct DNA tests on dogs who enter our facility therefore we are unable to guarantee breed or breed mix. Information provided by shelter staff, volunteers, and veterinarians is used to give a best estimate as to a dog's breed make up. We do our best to inform adopters about the potential breeds for each dog.\n\nWe are a dog only facility so we do not know how most of our dogs will be with cats. Even if a dog is surrendered to us and said to be good with cats there is no way to be sure the dog will be good with your cats. We do have a 7 day foster-to-adopt program so that you can see how the dog interacts with your cats before adoption.",

            "description": "Meet Maisy! This loveable pup was surrendered to DCHS due to unfortunate \ncircumstances but at no fault of her own. At about 2 years old and 15 pounds she is a great little lady who loves just about everyone once given some time to warm up. Once she's comfortable with her surroundings Maisy would love to be a lap dog. She also enjoys long walks (sits well to put on her harness and sweater), soft squeaky toys, treats, and sharing a bed with her humans. She aspires to be a great watch dog as she likes to warn you anytime someone/something is near! She is however very food motivated so redirection when necessary should be fairly easy. \n\nPlacement Recommendations:\nOwner Experience Level: Some Experience\nCats: Yes\nDogs: Yes\nKids: Middle School +Want to know more? Please call us! We've found that back and forth via email regarding a specific animal is not always effective and quick because our email is not monitored on a regular basis. So, for specific information regarding this wonderful pet, please contact one of our adoption counselors at (715) 232-9790. They are available between the hours of 8 am and 7 pm (7 days a week, excluding holidays). Thanks for your interest!",

I am an adorable Lab mix that was born on 12-20-20. Our momma was rescued as a stray and had puppies. \n\nI am good with other dogs my size, and kids. I am unsure about cats since I have not met any yet. It is important that my new family understand the commitment and amount of work puppies need before adopting. I also need someone who is home frequently because I can't be left alone for a long period of time due to being a puppy! A family that is active and is open to helping me learn the way of being a good dog is a PLUS! If you are interested in me please fill out an application today. XOXO\n\nWhat my foster mama says about me: Last but not least is our sweet little Cupcake! This little princess is the tiniest of the litter. She as sweet as she is snuggly and her coat feels like silk. She is going to be a beautiful girl .\n\n\nLocated near West Bloomfield, MI\n\n$225 DEPOSIT REQUIRED!\n\nAdoption fee: $450 ($50 refund after spay/neuter)\n\nAdoption Application: http://almosthomeanimals.orgTo complete an adoption application, go to: http://almosthomeanimals.org/applications/adoption/",

Lucky for me HALO is going to take very good care of my surgical needs! I need a little more time for my growth plates to finish closing and then in a couple months it will be one leg at a time. I am super sweet and love children of all ages. Due to the soreness in my rear legs I would not want small children crawling or tugging on me. I love squeaker toys and stuffed. I love car rides, the dog park, walks, playing, sunbathing, treats, every person I meet and of course cuddles! I am going to make a family super happy one day and I pray that day is soon!All of our dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, up to date with age appropriate vaccinations, heart worm or feleuk/FIV tested, fecal tested, rabies and tag, and microchipped before being placed in your home. Our adoption fee helps cover this cost.",

            "description": "Hi there, my name is Leo and I'm a VERY big boy, but I am a huge softie. I came to Stray Haven as part of a transport from a high kill shelter in North Carolina, but it just so happens a manager at the shelter was friends with my former owner. They learned that the dog I lived with didn't like me at all and would bully me constantly. It got so bad that my family felt I needed to be re-homed and my mom really wanted me to come to Stray Haven because she felt I'd find a great home here. I am pretty much perfect. I have lived with kids, other dogs (there was a chihuahua and a Rottweiler mix in the home I got along great with), cats, chickens, rabbits, livestock. My family had 100 acres so we often got to run and play and frolic. I also learned that trampolines are so much fun, especially when kids are playing with me. I don't really like baths or to be sprayed with water but I do like to dip my feet into a good pond or creek to explore the shores. I am super duper housetrained and my mom said I am crate trained as well. Although I wasn't left alone often, I am a great boy in my crate. I am very food motivated and get so excited about food, so I'm easy to train and already know \"\"sit,\"\" \"\"down,\"\" and \"\"stay\"\" but may also need some brush ups when I get to my new home. I love that there's a big yard for me to play and romp and have fun. And although I'm ok on leash, I didn't do a lot of that in my previous home, so I'll need some work in this area. The staff says I will easily find a home, and I hope that's true. I'm enjoying my time at Stray Haven but I'd sure love to find a home and truly get to experience all this new stuff to me called snow. It seems like so much fun! And I just have so much love to give, I hope I find a home soon.

I am a bit on the shy side but once I warm up I'm the goofiest girl you'll ever meet! I am such a loving girl. I love pets and attention. I could sit at your feet all day if you'd let me. I follow the caretakers around here and I'm obsessed with them. They gave me a big yard to run around in! I'm not quite sure how I feel about the snow yet but I'm getting used to it. I'm kinda lazy. I spend most of my day napping with short bursts of energy when I'm outside!. I did live with other dogs and my former owner said I could jump 5 foot fences. Just something to know if you're considering me. Of course with lots of walks and exercise, I'd have no need to leave. Since I'm just a pup and quite tall, make sure you're ready for all the action I'll bring to your life. I bring new meaning to the term \"\"puppy proofing.\"\" :)\n\nIf you wanna come meet my sweet face, come on down to Stray Haven!\nStray Haven Humane Society & SPCA\n194 Shepard Rd., Waverly, NY 14892\n(607) 565-2859, www.strayhavenspca.org \nOpen hours (winter): Tues, Wed & Thurs Noon - 6pm; Sat 10am-4pm",

I was found as a stray so there isn't much anyone knows about my history. I'm looking for my second chance here! I'm ready for my fur-ever family! I have A LOT of energy. I zoom every time I get to free run in the big yard out there! I am obsessed with the snow! I love to bury my face in it and get crazy zoomies. I don't like to sit still. I like to be busy and do something! Don't worry, I do have my down time and get some naps in but I would rather be on the move, exploring the day. I seem to get along with female dogs instead of males. I am very stand offish when it comes to male dogs. I have just been neutered so maybe my stance has changed but the staff hasn't gotten a chance to introduce me yet. If you're active and looking for a cool pal to go on an adventure, I'm your guy!

I am super smart, and am eager to please. I get along with other dogs and act as if I have never seen a stranger before. It is probably best that I go to a home with no cats, as I am a cattle dog after all and the cats may not like to be herded. I am working on crate training as well as potty training, so I can be the perfect dog in your home! If you are interested in adopting me, my foster mom Liz who can be reached at 214-616-6128 can tell you more about how much she adores me! I am neutered, up to date on vaccines and microchipped, ready for my new home! If you are interested in adopting me, feel free to fill out an adoption application at https://shelter2rescue.org/DogAdoption.html",

            "description": "In a world of energetic Aussies, Elsa is laidback Aussie doodle who loves to be cuddled by her person. Calm and quiet, Elsa is about 3 years old and 35 pounds. She likes to be curled up on her bed near her humans, but will jump in and join a game of chase with her canine friends if the opportunity arises.\n\nElsa is hearing and vision impaired so she is working on touch commands. She is very smart and is already house trained and crate trained. She loves going on walks and is spectacular on a leash. She would do well in a home that is relatively quiet and she needs a fenced-in yard for safe adventures. If you have snuggles and love for Elsa, please reach out.\n\nElsa is up to date on vaccinations, spayed, microchipped, and current on heartworm/flea and tick prevention. Also included in her adoption is a Fi GPS collar and one year of GPS service subscription. If she were to escape, as soon as she leaves the safe zone you set around your home, you are alerted\nso that you can find Elsa's whereabouts. Youll also be able to see how many steps per day she takes to ensure she gets the right amount of exercise, alongside many other features to explore in the Fi mobile app.",

And we have alot of energy. High energy! We are working on potty training. Up to date on vaccines. Microchipped and spayed. We each have our own unique personalities. We will do well in a home with a big yard to run. These girls will make great hiking buddies . they love the outdoors. They are not shy at all. Maybe will do better in a home with older kids 11 and up. And they like other dogs. Cats no. Please fill out an application if interested. My foster moms said we are special puppies.",

            "description": "This sweet, silly boy is Squiggles! His interests include cuddles, naps, long walks, sniffing around, car rides, earning treats, and licking faces. He loves all people and is happiest in a home full of humans. Squiggles can be slower to warm up to men he doesn't know, but he warms up quickly, and before long, he will roll on his back and ask for a belly rub. Squiggles is a long and lean pup still developing coordination, but he is learning to walk very well on a harness and enjoys all the people who stop and tell him how handsome he is. He's also a smart pup who will do anything for his favorite meatball treats and already knows some basic commands like sit and down. He truly lives to make his humans happy, and for such a young dog, he listens very well. Born to be a loyal companion, he does very well when with his humans. He has little interest in running around the yard alone, instead preferring to lay quietly by his human's side until they need him. When he needs to go potty, he heads straight to the door and politely waits to be let out. Squiggles hasn't had any accidents so far! He also loves his chew toys and knows to leave household items alone, unless they smell like food! Squiggles is a pro at crate training but has also done well left to roam the bedroom. He may whine for a few minutes when people go, though he is fast to fall asleep when waiting for his humans to return. While he is also quick to investigate strange noises, he saves his powerful bark for when he really has something to say. He can be fairly submissive around other dogs and cats in the home, but any squirrels in the yard better watch out! This young pup still has lots to learn but is sweet and eager to please! Are you ready to teach him to be the best boy!",

He'll also hope for your petting! He's also always happy to meet new people, just wanting their pets, too. This very smart boy gets up in the morning with a burst of energy, wanting to go outside for playtime and short walks. He walks calmly on his leash, not reacting to other dogs he sees. At home, he likes playing with his doggie housemate and the teenager he lives with. He's also living nicely with a cat, although they stay in separate rooms. He has recovered from parvo and is beginning to learn basic commands, now understanding 'sit.' And he is also house-trained. Spudz has some separation anxiety that makes him always want to be with his humans. He would do well in a home with patient, loving people who are home a lot and can help him feel confident and secure when they are out. He'd also love a calm canine companion. Come meet this adorable boy!",

He'll let you hug him for as long as you need on those stressful days, without wiggling or squirming to get out. He also loves curling up as close as he can to you on the couch. Even though he's still considered a puppy, he's extremely well mannered. When it's treat or meal time he sits like a little gentleman, or does a little dance with his two front paws. He loves to hang out in his crate or the couch with his best plushy pal Mr. Monkey. His foster is currently crate training him, and he already knows sit and stay! He hasn't been able to meet other animals, but he wins the heart of every adult human he meets. It is also likely that he would be a great little companion to a small kiddo. He would do well in either an apartment or a house. Chandler would make the most loving companion and snuggle bug! Come meet him today!",

She's been allowed to sleep in the bed and rides great in the car. Her favorite thing to do is cuddle and she knows her name. She also responds well to commands such as come and learns quite quickly. \n\nPeaches is a NO CHARGE adoption and can be microchipped for an additional $8.75.

            "description": "Meet Viking!  He's a handsome young male mix, ready for fun and adventure!  He's very ball motivated and fetch seems to be his favorite activity - even more than treats!  Viking is friendly with humans, but has been reactive to some of our other male dogs.  He's medium/large with a beautiful brindle coat.  Viking is only about a year old, a high energy guy looking for an active household!  If you love to throw a ball, Viking could be just the dog for you!  He is ready to be your jogging, biking, & hiking buddy.  He has a high prey drive and is always on the lookout for those pesky gophers and scampering squirrels.  We suspect he may need a home with no small furry or feathered creatures that would need to be chased down.   If you're ready for a partner in adventure, please consider Viking!  Come check out Viking and our other dogs available for adoption at 2650 Washington Blvd, Crescent City, CA 95531.\n\nWe pre-screen adopters interested in our dogs at Del Norte Animal Control, and an adoption application will be required from those interested in providing a fab furever home to Viking.  Please call us at (707) 464-7235 for additional information.  More photos of this dog may be available on the Dogs of Del Norte County Facebook page.",

            "description": "Meet Bella!  She's a medium/large mix with a healthy build!  Bella is in need of a new home, after her owner passed away suddenly and no one in the family could take her.  She's a sweet 2-3 year old female.  Bella doesn't seem to have had much training, but is very treat motivated (watch your fingers)!  She is good at \"sit\" though.  She apparently hasn't had much leash experience, but seems to be getting the hang of it.  She is playful, and stuffed toys seem to be her favorite.   Bella does need some work on her leash skills and boundaries with humans, but she has a good, friendly nature with great potential to be a wonderful companion.  Check out Bella and our other dogs available for adoption at 2650 Washington Blvd, Crescent City, CA 95531.\n\nWe pre-screen adopters interested in our at Del Norte Animal Control, and an adoption application will be required from those interested in providing a fab furever home to Bella.  Please call us at (707) 464-7235 for additional information.  More photos of this dog may be available on the Dogs of Del Norte County Facebook page.",

            "description": "Animal Profile: Cher is an adorable ~5 year old Chihuahua mix who was rescued from a high kill shelter in southern CA. She will be joining us from California on January 10th.\n\nSeattle Foster Update: Meet Cher! She is a sweet, timid at times, and adorable little pup. She takes a couple of days to warm up but once she does, she follows you all around. Her favorite activity is lounging with her pack, cuddled in a blanket on a couch or a bed. She loves belly rubs. She is potty trained and has not had an accident in the home as long as she has been on a consistent potty routine. Generally quiet, she gets excited when invited to play and does bark a bit, which can be trained out of her. She gets excited around other dogs, wanting to play with them (in the process may bark). She is crate-trained. She prefers sleeping in the bed with her humans but is comfortable sleeping in her crate as well. She is not very fond of toys though. She is also good with other humans (as mentioned may not immediately go into their arms but is comfortable with stranger's touch). She is also great with car rides. We take her for long rides around the town. We will continue to post more info as she settles in!\n\nAdoption Info: Adoption fee is $500, which includes spay/neuter, current rabies/DAPPV/bordetella vaccinations, microchip, health certificate, and heartworm test. All adoption fees are donations to a Washington non-profit corporation and all donations go to benefit the animals in our rescue.\n\nApply online at www.DogGoneSeattle.org\n\nAnimal History: This dog was rescued from euthanasia at a high-kill shelter in California and will be available for adoption in Seattle, once evaluated in a loving foster home in the greater Seattle area.",

Cut a piece of hair, wipe feet, give meds... He is highly allergic to getting his vaccines. So precautionary measures are necessary for his yearly physical. He has a few medical concerns: possible collapsed trachea, his knees have luxating patellas (vet mild), and narrowing of vertebrates in two areas which is being treated with prednisone which seems to help. $400 Adoption fee includes vaccines, neuter, heartworm test, deworming, and microchip.

She's taught to be around 3-4 months old and now weighs in at only 24lbs.....with long legs.  \n\nIf you've been looking to bring in a new pup, consider our Ms. Maggie.

I\u2019ve kept my puppy energy after all these years and love hiking, going on long walks and even going for runs with my person. I\u2019d prefer to be in a home where I\u2019m your one-and-only companion animal (so I can get all the cuddles!), but love the dog park as long as there aren\u2019t any smaller pups around. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like them and want to get to meet them, it\u2019s just that I\u2019m not as gentle around lil\u2019s when we have disagreements\u2026 I don\u2019t want to get blamed when they pick the fight. Similarly, I don\u2019t want to be blamed for knocking over a small child, so I would say I make a better playmate for teenagers.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this pooch, please download the Adoption Questionnaire (farescue.org/pdf_files/questionnaire_canine.pdf), fill it out and email it back to us at info@farescue.org or fax (310) 362-0321. You can also meet this and/or other available dogs at our weekend adoptions.\n\n[Kali is 5 years old and weighs 68 lbs.]\n\n(2102)",

From there you can find the dog and comment on his or her picture which will notify the foster family of your interest. \n\nWe are a foster-based rescue, so adoptable animals are in private homes in the NW Florida Panhandle. The best way to meet one of our pets is to attend our adoption events on Saturday. To find out where we'll be this week, visit our Facebook page at www.SavingwithSoul.com. \n\nThank you for considering a rescued pet!",

She is a very sweet girl to people and \"some\" dogs.  She came from an abusive home and has been very loved but just cannot get along with one of the dogs in the household.\n\nShe is house broken, crate trained and is an active dog that has a good energy level and can take all the  \"play time\" you can give to her.  She is leash trained, so maybe a family that would jog with her would also be helpful. \n\nBecause of her energy level we would require a home with a fenced yard so she can freely play.  \n\nCurrently she is being fostered in North Carolina and would be transported to an approved adopter.  If you're looking for a wonderful playmate, you can find our online application at:  \nhttp://diamonddogsrescueinc.com",

From there you can find the dog and comment on his or her picture which will notify the foster family of your interest. \n\nWe are a foster-based rescue, so adoptable animals are in private homes in the NW Florida Panhandle. The best way to meet one of our pets is to attend our adoption events on Saturday. To find out where we'll be this week, visit our Facebook page at www.SavingwithSoul.com. \n\nThank you for considering a rescued pet!",

From there you can find the dog and comment on his or her picture which will notify the foster family of your interest. \n\nWe are a foster-based rescue, so adoptable animals are in private homes in the NW Florida Panhandle. The best way to meet one of our pets is to attend our adoption events on Saturday. To find out where we'll be this week, visit our Facebook page at www.SavingwithSoul.com. \n\nThank you for considering a rescued pet!",

            "description": "Meet Levi! This guy is a handsome American Pit Bull Terrier mix who is looking for his forever home.\n\nThis shy boy has a very sad story. He came from a small town in Texas where he was dumped in a kill shelter after flooding due to a hurricane that destroyed the area. Levi found himself sick, homeless, broken down and afraid of the world, through no fault of his own. It's likely that Levi missed out on some key socialization as a puppy, and sees the world a little differently than other dogs. Levi was so broken down in a shelter environment, that he sat frozen and trembling in fear. Levi's past was unclear, but we knew for certain that he wouldn't have survived without help from a loving foster home.\n\nLevi is 4-5 years old, 64 lbs with an athletic build. He has a shiny reverse brindle coat and large, soulful eyes. He is a mellow, quiet guy who is constantly surveying the world around him, trying to understand his place in it. Levi communicates differently than other dogs. When he is nervous or unsure, he will retreat, or freeze. He requires a structured, calm household with adults and older children where he can move slowly to learn to be comfortable. He thrives in the outdoors but takes some time getting used to new indoor environments. \n\nLevi is a dog that needs a very slow decompression. The key word with Levi is \"baby steps\" as it takes him some time to build up his confidence in new environments. He learned how to be a dog for the first time in a home and Levi's goofy, silly side started to come out as he learned how to trust, socialize and play. His previous foster family said he is an absolute snuggle monster and loves nothing more than cuddling up at his families side on the couch, sprawled out in comfort. \n\nLevi would do great as an only dog with an active owner who enjoys plenty of hikes, runs and walks. Although Levi has lived with dogs in the past, it has become evident he is more of an introvert when it comes to other canines. He enjoys the occasional play date romp with dog friends but prefers to come home and recharge in doggy solitude with his humans.\n\nLevi has lived in the big city, but is a country boy at heart where he has plenty of space for hikes and to run. He is medium energy and loves to learn new tricks and excels at training, especially when treats are involved. He is very food motivated and intelligent. Levi loves the outdoors and finds joy in chasing squirrels and birds, destroying cardboard boxes. Due to his prey drive, we recommend a home without cats or other small animals. Levi is great with all humans, large and small.\n\nThe American Pit Bull Terrier is a widely misunderstood breed, often thought of as protection or guardian animal. Levi is the opposite. He is not protective, but shy and gentle. He is easy on a leash and has grown accustomed to sleeping on the couch while he people are hanging out at home, and would enjoy sleeping in bed with you at night, if you eased him into it. Levi is neutered, potty trained, crate trained, UTD on all vaccines, micro-chipped and heartworm free.\n\nTo apply for Levi please fill out an application at www.doggedly.org/adoption-app",

Taken to the shelter as an intentional stray, he was out of time and next to be euthanized when we saw his smiling face and made arrangements to have him pulled for our rescue.\n\nHe was fully vetted, neutered, microchipped and quarantined before sending to foster.  He is currently in NH looking to find his forever family.\n\nHis foster mom says: This handsome boy needs a home! Lots of energy and he's a huge snuggle bug. Hes great with kids and other dogs. Loves car rides, walks, kisses, and lots of love.  He needs some training on leash, we've been working on that one.   \n\nAround 2.5 years old, Mack is a retriever/hound mix weighing in at 61 lbs. \nTrainer evaluation available and he said:\nMack FULL of energy, loves people other dogs and treats. This energy is all friendly and happy wanting to play active. Mack is one of the happiest dogs I have ever evaluated.  Because of his good energy level we will require that he go to a home that is active and where there is a fenced in yard so he can get good exercise \n\nHe is good with other dogs...very playful and friendly...BUT no cats.",

From there you can find the dog and comment on his or her picture which will notify the foster family of your interest. \n\nWe are a foster-based rescue, so adoptable animals are in private homes in the NW Florida Panhandle. The best way to meet one of our pets is to attend our adoption events on Saturday. To find out where we'll be this week, visit our Facebook page at www.SavingwithSoul.com. \n\nThank you for considering a rescued pet!",

He is currently in a foster home with children, other dogs, and pet rats and does well with all of them! Teddy is currently in training with KISS dog training working on his fearfulness, but once he learns to trust you, he loves with all of his heart. His foster mom says he is extremely loyal and she loves him to death! KISS has offered a free 30 minute consult with Teddy's new adopters to continue his training. Teddy was neglected as a pup, so he needs a loyal family that is willing to learn all that they can about him and dogs in general. He will make a family extremely happy!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Teddy, please fill out an application via our website at https://therescueproject.net/adoption-application and we will get back to you via email once your application has been reviewed.  If you have further questions please feel free to reach out to us at adoptionstrp@gmail.com\n\nTeddy's adoption fee is $200 and includes age appropriate vaccines, spay/neuter, microchip, deworm, heartworm testing.",

We will make every attempt to process all applications within 3 business days of receipt.\n\n// // Meet sweet & sassy Arleen! Arleen is a 7 lb maltese mix who is 9 years young! She arrived at the shelter a diamond in the rough~ her coat was matted and neglected and her eye needed to be removed. She got a totally 80's new wave haircut to save some hair around her face when she was groomed prior to her surgery. Arleen sees fine out of her remaining eye and has no trouble getting around the house and likes to explore in the yard. She is gentle and sweet and gets along well with other dogs. She has a good hearty appetite and gets excited when you come home or its time for her to eat. She will make a nice little companion dog for someone looking for a little buddy happy just to be close to you. Arleen is house and crate trained and will use a pee pad if you put one out for her. Arleen is the sweetest little lady who deserves to be spoiled and loved in her golden years. Her adoption fee is $200.\n\nAll Second Chance Dog Rescue dogs are spayed/neutered, are up to date on vaccines and have microchips prior to adoption.\n\nAdoption fees vary depending on age of dog.

Please fill out a pre-adoption application so we know you are interested in meeting/adopting one of our animals.\nThe breeds of our dogs and cats are a 'best guess.' We often do not know what mix they are and have to base it on what we think they look like, and base it on breeds often found in the area they came from.

            "description": "Hi! I'm Burke and I'm ~45 lbs of love. My favorite thing in the world is to be pet by my foster humans. I do entertain myself by chewing on bones and playing with toys, but I'd trade them for cuddles on the couch any day! When I'm really happy, I wag my little tail so fast and my whole bottom wiggles! Maybe I can show you sometime!\n\nI have two foster dog siblings right now. One is full grown like me and we love to run around outside and chase each other. My other foster sibling is a little puppy. I was pretty scared of her at first, but I'm quickly warming up to her! I was actually a bit scared of a few things when I first got here (why are LaCroix's so loud when they open, and why does my human drink so many???) but I'm gaining confidence so fast.\n\nAt night I sleep in my crate next to the puppy. I'd definitely prefer to sleep in my crate in the same room as my people, or maybe even in bed with them! Have I mentioned I love humans?\n\nMy perfect forever family will be affectionate, while still providing me structure & guidance. I'd love to take a training class and learn the commands that my foster sister gets all these treats for - I like treats so I'll learn quickly! I'd also love to have a dog sibling to keep me company, and continue to build my confidence!\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nAll our Warrior Dogs will have all age appropriate medical care and vaccines, a microchip, and spay/neuter before adoption unless age is a factor with a puppy younger than 6-12 months at the time of adoption. If that is the case, the spay/neuter will be covered in the adoption fee and the owner will be responsible to have the procedure completed at a Warrior Dog Rescue Veterinarian at the appropriate time.\n\nPlease note that the majority of our dogs in rescue are from shelters where they have been found as strays or abandoned. Their breed description is based on our very best educated guess based on physical characteristics and their dispositions. If they came to our rescue as an owner surrender, the breed description will be listed as provided by the previous owner.\n\nAdoption Fee - $450\n\nTo apply for this pup, please submit an Adoption Application at http://warriordogrescue.com/adopt/adoption-application/",

Major flinched any time I tried to pet him. He ran away when I got near him. He was scared, confused, hungry, dirty and in pain. I gave him a nice meal and lots of water, which he scarfed down. I then watched as he went to the bathroom, in extreme pain. Before trying anything further, I allowed him to decompress safely inside his kennel. After about 30 minutes of barking, he finally wore himself out and took a good 4 hour nap. Once he woke up, I gave him a nice warm bath. During the bath, he kept drinking all the water and just looking at me confused--like 'what is this lady doing?? She is giving me nice touches and massaging my whole body?? This is weird, but I think I like it.'In giving Major a bath, I was able to fully exam his body and realize the extent of his medical issues. It was heartbreaking. He was in such pain while pooping because he had a perineal hernia the size of a grapefruit! He also had a 5 pound pendulum tumor hanging from his side. I could easily count at least a dozen more tumors/masses over his body. I also learned his tongue hangs out because the inside of his mouth is completely jacked up!\n\nIn less than 12 hours, Major has already begun trusting me. During breakfast, his butt never stopped wiggling and he wanted me to pet him the whole time while eating. Every time I stopped, he would turn around and look at me like I was a dumb-dumb for stopping! After breakfast, he just wanted to sit by me and lick my face! When I put him back in his kennel, he immediately just laid down and started sawing logs He now feels safe and knows life is going to be pretty okay from now on. There is no better feeling than this.",

He's under a year old, very healthy and the sweetest dog you'll ever meet. He loves other dogs, and all people he meets. Oliver lives to run and play like most puppies. He will need a family that has a yard and time to play with him. We had Oliver neutered, vaccinated and chipped. If you'd like to meet this darling boy, please complete our adoption application found on dexterfoundation.com.  We're only adopting out to the Los Angeles area. Adoption donation $300",

He is 7 months old and 12 pounds, we don't know for sure but he is likely mixed with dachshund. His foster dad says he is crate and potty trained, and does great on leash walks! He is playful, energetic, likes playing fetch with stuffed toys, and loves his walks. He lived with young kids in Mexico, and has done great with dogs while he has been in our care. Felix is just a great all around puppy! We aren't sure how he will do with cats though. We think he will top out at about 20 pounds so if you are looking for a pint sized companion, he will do well in any living situation! If you would like to meet Felix, please fill out an adoption application on our website and an adoption coordinator will be in contact.http://therescueddog.org/dog-adoption-application/",

            "description": "Gonzo is an adorable blond 5 year old Lhasa Apso, who weighs about 15 pounds.  He is looking for an understanding home where he can snuggle and love and be cared for on his own terms.  Those terms are generous, but they are specific, so potential adopters should read his bio carefully before applying to adopt him.\n\nGonzo was found as a stray and spent some time in the doggy jail before Wonder Pets was asked to help him out by getting him into a foster home and loving on him.  \n\nGonzo was found to have significant dry eye issues, and it quickly became clear that he is very picky about how his eyes are cared for.  Gonzo has severe anxiety about having  eye drops administered and is extremely uncooperative.  His foster family has worked through a care regimen with eventual wonderful success and his eyes are showing huge improvement.  Any adopter will need to commit to continued lifetime care of his dry eye and understand potential future complications and costs of this condition.  Techniques that worked (and didn't work) to encourage his cooperation will be provided to potential adopters. \n\nGonzo is cooperative for most routine care, but does NOT cooperate well with common grooming of his face (such as trimming of his facial hair).  He will usually allow a trusted person to brush him, but is very uncooperative for grooming that would require restraining.  Potential adopters should be aware of this and be able to recognize dog body language and help him navigate stressful grooming care.  Adopters should understand that it will take time and patience for him to build up trust for this, and should be committed to working with him long-term to build this trust to work through some of these issues. \n\nBecause Gonzo is very picky about the way he is physically interacted with (especially around his face), he would NOT be a good fit for young children living in the home.  Older resident children that are good at understanding and respecting dog boundaries would be fine, but a monitored introduction would be required prior to adoption.  Visiting respectful children (with supervision) would likely be fine for Gonzo. \nAs Gonzo has grown in trust with his foster family, his playful and affectionate nature has become apparent.  Gonzo loves to snuggle , preferring snuggles on the bed at night over sleeping in his kennel.  Gonzo also loves to play on occasion and enjoys a squeaker toy and maybe some games of chase. \n\nGonzo appears to be potty trained, but a new home may require some work at re-learning what he already knows.  After a transitional period, he is generally pretty good about pottying where he should go. \nGonzo loves to go for walks and will happily dance and throw himself excitedly into his harness at walk times!  He enjoys and needs these walks so much, but does not require a lot of exercise.  He enjoys meeting most new people (he does prefer women, but will warm up to most men) and other respectful dogs of all sizes, and is perfect with his resident foster cat.  Gonzo would not be a good fit for a resident dog that is bossy or forceful with him, as he will react negatively to being bullied by another dog.  \n\nWhen Gonzo is feeling silly, he will attempt to dart out a door trying to entice his people into a game of chase.  Potential adopters should have a plan in place to keep him safe from the dangers of this behavior!  Gonzo is affectionate and enjoys being with his people, but like many Lhasa Apsos, he is stubborn and prefers to obey requests on his own terms.  Patience is a must with this boy!\n\nGonzo does not like to be left by his people and will vocalize that displeasure loud and long at times.  He will not be a good fit for apartments or close-dwelling living situations.  He would prefer a family that is home more often than not, or that is able to bring him with them on family outings/working outside the home setting.  He rides well in the car and will wait patiently while his people are running errands.  Gonzo's foster family is currently working from home, but he has been able to be left for several hours while they are away and has tolerated this okay.  \n\nGonzo is neutered, microchipped, wormed, and current on routine and rabies vaccinations.  His adoption donation is $450.\n\nNo phone calls please, go to www.wonderpetsrescue.petfinder.com to complete an adoption application.

            "description": "Meet Ruby, a precious one-year-old, 45 lb. boxer mix ready. This sweet girl has not had a very good start to her life. She was found as a stray on the streets of North Carolina with a piece of metal chain around her neck. It was clear from her timid personality, and scars, that she endured neglect from her previous owners. Now that she is in a loving foster home in Connecticut, she is starting to warm up and show her true personality.\n\nOnce she's comfortable, Ruby LOVES to cuddle and will happily give you kisses. Her tail will wag happily as she takes treats gently from your hand and she is beginning to roll over for belly rubs. She enjoys the company of her humans, along with other dogs. Her foster family says she has great manners, is housetrained, and walks very well on leash. She needs an adopter that is willing to take it slow with her and one whom understands decompression time with rescue dogs. This dog has been through a lot and just wants love. A fenced yard is highly preferred.\n\nHer adoption fee is $350 and Ruby comes up to date on vaccines, microchipped, heartworm negative, and will be spayed soon (appointment is scheduled for 2/16). If you are interested in adopting this sweet girl, please complete the application at form.jotform.com/200883908893166 or email info@happilyfureverafter.org.",

She is believed to possibly be a min pin/hound mix. She was part of a hoarding case where there were 70+ dogs living in the same trailer. She is currently awaiting spay/microchip and will be available for adoption soon. \n\nPlease apply via the link below. Thank you\nhttps://www.jotform.com/201574307810045",

I have always lived with my former owner until she overdosed on drugs. I was found locked in her room with her deceased body after 4 days by EMTs. When they found me I was so hungry and so thirsty. A family member came right over to pick me up but they couldn\u2019t care for me long term so a pals volunteer came to get me at 12:30 in the morning. She said I am such a very good boy, I am great with all of her dogs of all shapes and sizes and I am even good with her cat, she is working on me to let her hold me but for now I\u2019m happy just being close to her and wagging my tail every time she says my name. I haven\u2019t always had a great life and even though I had one owner my whole life I didn\u2019t really do much with me, I was kind of left to fend for myself. I am a very sweet boy who is learning all of the new rules and how to be a dog that is loved. She doesn\u2019t kennel me when she leaves and I\u2019m a very good boy when she is gone. I would love a home where I can get used to somebody and never have to be moved again.\n\nThe adoption donation fee is $300 which is tax-deductible and goes towards the care of homeless pets with Pals for Paws. \n\nTo expedite the adoption process you can fill out an application online at www.palsforpawsinc.com/adopt. Please note the adoption application doesn\u2019t bind you to anything. Pals for Paws reserves the right to refuse any adoption application for any reason and at any point in the adoption process. \n\nTo view our other wonderful Homeless Pets visit www.palsforpawsinc.com/pet-list ALSO be sure to LIKE Pals for Paws on Facebook at www.facebook.com/palsforpaws.inc \n\nAll Pals for Paws Rescue animals are fully vetted:\n*Spayed/Neutered\n*Groomed\n*Shots updated plus Leptospirosis \n*Micro-chipped\n*Dewormed \n*On Heart-worm prevention\n*On Flea and Tick Prevention\n* Dentals are done if needed \n\nYou only need to see your vet for a \u201cmeet n greet\u201d of your new family member and to turn in their medical records.\n\nPals for Paws is a 501(c)3 animal rescue. Every penny donated and every penny received through adoption fees goes right back into the organization. There are times when the volunteers have to dip into their pockets to help the animals. We do not euthanize because a pet is sick, heart-worm positive, or has a broken leg; we fix it all, big and small. We strive to go above and beyond when caring for and socializing our animals. We understand the importance of getting to know each and every animal available for adoption in an effort to place them in the most perfect home possible. \nIf you are looking for a particular type of dog or have special needs, We can help!

He's big and looks intimidating but is not aggressive. He does favor women, men he will bark, but it's more of an alert than aggression. I tested his reaction once a male came to him- no growl just a bark then smell. \nI spent a good amount of time with him tested with other dogs he does good. Along side a dog aggressive dog he did not react. \nHe's playful & clumsy yet will not constantly jump on you. \nHe listens well. Will sit and shake hands. He would prob need someone that can handle his size and prob no small children because of his size could easily bop them over.\nThe adoption fee is $250 and includes spay/neuter, first vaccinations, microchip with life-long free registration, deworming, heart worm test for dogs over 6 months.

Please visit our website to learn more about our adoption process at newhoperescue.org. \n\nThis dog is being fostered with New Hope Dog Rescue (Saskatoon).  If you are interested in adopting please fill out an Adoption Application. Meet and greets are by appointment only and done so after an adoption application has been submitted. A successful applications will be contacted by the foster home to discuss further. We are volunteer run so please be patient.\n\nMilo is a happy little girl. She likes to cuddle,  but also likes her independence. She will happily cuddle with her humans,  but is also happy snuggled in on the floor. Milo has very soft fur and the longest,  cutest ears!  She loves to play!  Milo likes to tug and pull on her chew toys. She loves tug of war!  Milo is a short legged/basset hound mix. She will probably grow to be a medium sized dog. Milo is working on house training. She is very good at peeing every time she is taken out. She sleeps in a pen at night and stays in a pen when her people are at work. \n\nMilo has been microchipped, dewormed, current on age appropriate vaccines and has received a health check from a vet. adoption fee is 495 (200 is refunded upon proof of spay).\n\nTo view more dogs go to http://www.newhoperescue.org/adopt/available-dogs/\n\nDisclaimer: in most cases we are guessing the breed mix. These are best guesses on our part. For puppies it can be extremely difficult and we are also guessing on what size they will be. \n\nNEW HOPE DOG RESCUE is not a shelter. Our dogs are placed in loving foster homes. WE NEED FOSTER HOMES TO HELP MORE DOGS - CONTACT US TODAY!!!\nDefinitions:\nPending - means that we are working through the adoption process with the 1st applicant. We usually don't add the pending until we are pretty sure the adoption will go through (like at the home visit stage)\nAdopted - you know!! A happy ending for a homeless dog.",

He was born in his foster home with his 8 siblings. His mom is about 40lbs. He is a typical playful and friendly pup. He has been raised with young children.\n\nPuppies have special needs and require a home where there will be someone available to care for, socialize, and train them during the day.

It includes spay/neuter, age appropriate vaccinations, fecal testing, deworming, flea and tick preventative, heartworm preventative, free vet visit at one of our participating vets, and micro-chipping.\n\nWe must have an application, conduct a phone interview, and meet your entire family to approve an adoption.

Please visit our website to learn more about our adoption process at newhoperescue.org. \n\nThis dog is being fostered with New Hope Dog Rescue (Saskatoon).  If you are interested in adopting please fill out an Adoption Application. Meet and greets are by appointment only and done so after an adoption application has been submitted. A successful applications will be contacted by the foster home to discuss further. We are volunteer run so please be patient.\n\nWalter is an adorable little puppy. He is very affectionate and loves to be held and cuddled. Nothing makes Walter happier than snuggling into his people for a nap.  Walter spends his day napping,  playing with his sister and being held by his people. Walter is a short legged mix. He will probably grow up to be a small/ medium sized dog. Walter is always happy. His tail is always wagging and he loves being around people. Walter would love to be in a family where he can be doted on. \n\nWalter has been microchipped, dewormed, current on age appropriate vaccines and has received a health check from a vet. adoption fee is $495 (200 refunded upon proof of neuter).\n\nTo view more dogs go to http://www.newhoperescue.org/adopt/available-dogs/\n\nDisclaimer: in most cases we are guessing the breed mix. These are best guesses on our part. For puppies it can be extremely difficult and we are also guessing on what size they will be. \n\nNEW HOPE DOG RESCUE is not a shelter. Our dogs are placed in loving foster homes. WE NEED FOSTER HOMES TO HELP MORE DOGS - CONTACT US TODAY!!!\nDefinitions:\nPending - means that we are working through the adoption process with the 1st applicant. We usually don't add the pending until we are pretty sure the adoption will go through (like at the home visit stage)\nAdopted - you know!! A happy ending for a homeless dog.",

She's a three year old german shepherd - she's a sweet girl and loves to play ball / enjoy long walks. She's so loyal and is a true german shepherd - she weighs 60 pounds. Harley needs a home who is experienced with the breed as she has some reactivity to dogs on leash but could do well playing with the right dogs. \n\nIf you are interested in meeting  please fill out an application at our website www.gobeyondrescue.org/adopt or contact us at sfbeyondrescue@gmail.com and we will connect with the owner!",

Every penny donated and every penny received through adoption fees goes right back into the organization. There are times when the volunteers have to dip into their pockets to help the animals. We do not euthanize because a pet is sick, heart-worm positive, or has a broken leg; we fix it all, big and small. We strive to go above and beyond when caring for and socializing our animals. We understand the importance of getting to know each and every animal available for adoption in an effort to place them in the most perfect home possible. \nIf you are looking for a particular type of dog or have special needs, We can help!

His eyes and scars tell a story none of us can imagine. Someone failed this guy, someone tortured him, someone broke him. Dart was found astray in Texas and ended up in the Harris county shelter. Tucked in a corner shaking he wasted away, he lost all hope, he was out of time. We couldn\u2019t let that happen! Rescue Rehome Repeat of South Louisiana has given this sweet boy the second chance he so deserves. Dart has been in our program 2.5 months now. His foster mom has been committed to his care and rehabilitation filling his life with love he\u2019s never felt before. LOVE! That\u2019s the key word. Gentle pets, warm beds, meals, treats and everything a dog needs. He\u2019s coming around! He has still yet to make a sound (no barks, no whines, no growls, no anything). He still prefers to be tucked away in a corner to feel safe and secure, but loves to go for a walk with his humans. He also loves his foster brothers and sisters. He\u2019s welcoming to all humans, kids (loved his new baby human although he wasn\u2019t uncertain about the crying) and doggos though he much prefers a quiet room to himself. He hasn\u2019t quite learned to be a normal dog yet. Dart doesn\u2019t run, he doesn\u2019t jump, beg, get the zoomies, fetch, play ball or even eat in your presence. He\u2019s just kind of \u201cthere\u201d. But boy, if someone has a big heart, I promise you just some more TLC and this sweet pup is going to soar!\nDart is seeking someone compassionate and patient. Someone who well help him relax, trust, and learn to be a pup. Honestly, he\u2019s just seeking LOVE!\n\nI know the RIGHT home for him is out there! Please share his story, please share his face. Someone out there is going to love you buddy, I PROMISE!!",

            "description": "Mugsy is a handsome, senior, male, tan chihuahua with a date of birth of 8/21/11. His owner was no longer able to keep he and Sasha\u2019s so they found themselves in need of rescue. Even though they both came from the same household they do not appear to be a bonded pair. Mugsy is a total sweetheart. He is neutered, up to date on vaccinations and being kept on heartworm and flea and tick prevention to maintain his good health. Mugsy has a throat condition that requires medication twice a day. Due to his more delicate nature, he will not be considered for homes with children. He will be a loving companion for someone in a quiet home. Mugsy\u2019s adoption donation is $225. If you would like to adopt Mugsy please complete the first step in the adoption process by filling out our online adoption application. You can find the link to our on-line adoption application at www.arfarkansas.com on the right-hand side of our home page. An application does not obligate you to adopt from us, but it does show that you are serious about the adoption process. Please remember our organization is staffed completely by volunteers.\nPlease Note: All applications are processed in the order received, but an adoption is made to the best application received for each of our animals. All applicants must provide a vet reference on the adoption application. If you are adopting a dog from ARFA, a fenced in yard for the dog will be required. Home visits often occur with each adoption. ARFA has the right to deny adoption to any applicant for any reason without explanation. Please remember that the adoption donation is not for purchase of a dog, but rather to cover the medical cost of all dogs in our care.\nTHE FINE PRINT\n1.  Animal Rescue Fund Arkansas reserves the right to deny any application, for any reason without explanation to the applicant.\n2.  You understand that we often take many applications on the same animal and that they are processed in the order that they come in. An application is in no way a reservation for any animal or a guarantee that you will be selected to adopt the animal.\n3.  If your application Is approved, you will be asked to sign a separate adoption contract.\n4.  Once the trial period is over, usually 1 week unless there are special circumstances, the adoption donation cannot be returned to you for any reason. It will have been used to help rescue another homeless animal and is no longer available therefore, if you return the dog to us for any reason, you will not be refunded your donation.\n5.  If the animal you want to adopt is placed in another home, you can transfer your application to another A.R.F.A. animal without completing additional paperwork.\n6.  You understand that this is a rescued pet. We rarely have any information about their past life circumstances.  We have all animals examined by a vet, brought up to date on shots, given their rabies vaccine, spayed/neutered (If old enough), wormed and checked for heartworms and if positive begin treatment.  We do our best to ensure that we are placing healthy pets but can make no guarantee to the health or temperament of this pet, and vet expenses are the responsibility of the adoptive family from the date of the adoption.  We require that you take the pet to a vet within one week of adoption for a check-up and to allow your vet to get a baseline for your new pet\u2019s health.\n",

He loves being outside but gets distracted easily on walks and will pull for the first few minutes. I feel that he thrive and do best in a home without small children due to the fact that my toddler stresses him out with sudden movements/ loud noises etc. He has never shown signs of aggression. He is up to date on vaccinations and neutered! \n\nBehaviors: \n\nskittish with loud noises/startled easily\nHas separation anxiety (will cry when crated but only ever crated if I leave. I work from home so I only leave to grab my daughter from daycare or grab groceries) \nWill dig if not exercised enough\nHas generalized anxiety/trouble sitting still but this is improving. \n\n\nZeus is being rehomed. Zeus needs training and consistency in his life. \n",

Every penny donated and every penny received through adoption fees goes right back into the organization. There are times when the volunteers have to dip into their pockets to help the animals. We do not euthanize because a pet is sick, heart-worm positive, or has a broken leg; we fix it all, big and small. We strive to go above and beyond when caring for and socializing our animals. We understand the importance of getting to know each and every animal available for adoption in an effort to place them in the most perfect home possible. \nIf you are looking for a particular type of dog or have special needs, We can help!

She is like your canine 'jack of all trades\u2019. She could be your running and hiking partner and after all that is done with, she could be your bestest cuddle buddy. Netflix night? Penny is all in for a couple of hours of cuddles! Penny is very much about her humans. When indoors, she is content just being close to and hanging out with her humans but show her a huge yard or field and she is gonnnnnne! She will run like the wind! There will be no catching up to her. Now, if you have high value treats handy, that may do the trick\u2026. Penny loves to chase ball and chew toys. If you have things going on, Penny will take the hint and quietly do her thing. She will check in every now and then to make sure you are staying on track with your chores. If Ms Penny is displeased about something, you will hear about it. She will grumble and give you her 2 cents :D \n\nPenny is 12-18 months old, 50lb Bluetick Coonhound. She is looking for an active home that could provide her with the mental and physical stimulation that she needs as well as valuable family time. Human and furry siblings are welcome!\n",

He has had a rough start to life in Canada and as such he needs a foster/adopter to help him work with his trust issues.  He loves men and will follow them to the ends of the earth.  Women and kids he has a hard time trusting and it takes time, a lot of treats and proper introductions.  As such, since his trust issues include kids, we are recommending a home with no children.  He loves going for walks and runs, but no off leash for this beauty because of his lack of trusting strangers. Once trust is built, he is amazing and will play and snuggle all day.\n\nOur rescue is called BARCS. We are a registered Non Profit.\nOur Website is www.barcsrescue.com. All our animals are posted on the website and updated often. If you would like to proceed we need an adoption application to be filled out. They can be found on our website. Once we receive your application, we will contact you to arrange a meeting with the pup you are interested in. \nWe look forward to hearing from you\n",

            "description": "Daisy Mae is looking for her forever home. Daisy is a sweet spayed female chi cross. She is about 2 years old. A long legged beauty, she weighs about 10 pounds. A stray from the Rio Grande Valley in south Texas, she was rescued and sent up to Montana to find a home. Daisy is house trained, doesn't stray far when outside, and loves the security of a kennel, provided the door is left open! As is typical of chi's, Daisy is shy at first, but given her space and time, she warms up and wants to be with her person/people all the time. She does the cutest little tap dance when she sees you and wants your attention. She would do best in a home with other dogs, as she is more comfortable in general if there are dogs around. She gets along with other dogs and is fine with cats. She does like to sleep with her people and loves to hang out and cuddle on the couch. If you are that special home that she is looking for, please fill out an online adoption application on our website LSAR.org",

            "description": "Female, 3 years, German shepherd/Boxer X, 71 lbs\n\nMy name is Nala. I am looking for my forever home. I am extremely loving and I want to please you. I am smart and do not miss very much. I love exercise and would love a fenced backyard. I also love walks but I do pull a bit. I'm working on that though. I am living in a house that is quite busy. I have two older sisters and a 10-year-old brother. I get along with them quite well. I know how to use the bathroom outside but I have had a couple accidents inside my new foster mom's house. I haven't been around other dogs so I'm not sure how I would act. I know when I see other pups through the window or on my walks, I start wagging my tail and get very excited. I know how to go into my kennel and I sleep through the night. I\u2019m also not much of a barker but get quite excited if I see a squirrel through the window.  I love to be surrounded by people. I can't wait to meet my new family. \n\nOur rescue is called BARCS. We are a registered Non Profit.\nOur Website is www.barcsrescue.com. All our animals are posted on the website and updated often. If you would like to proceed we need an adoption application to be filled out. They can be found on our website. Once we receive your application, we will contact you to arrange a meeting with the pup you are interested in. \nWe look forward to hearing from you\n",

Every penny donated and every penny received through adoption fees goes right back into the organization. There are times when the volunteers have to dip into their pockets to help the animals. We do not euthanize because a pet is sick, heart-worm positive, or has a broken leg; we fix it all, big and small. We strive to go above and beyond when caring for and socializing our animals. We understand the importance of getting to know each and every animal available for adoption in an effort to place them in the most perfect home possible. \nIf you are looking for a particular type of dog or have special needs, We can help!

She sleeps through the night as well. She plays well with kids and other dogs. I am not sure on cats. She loves to play with her toys and with our dog. She is such a snuggle bug. She is my shadow and wants to be loved on. We are working on manners now. She likes to check out what you have on the kitchen counter. Her forever home will be lucky to have this lady.\n\nTo meet Queen, fill out an application at www.pawsitivetailskc.org and her foster will be in touch to set that up! Her adoption fee is $250 and she is up to date on appropriate shots, dewormed, current on preventatives, spayed and microchipped.",

Please apply online at http://texasgreatdane.org/adoption-application/ **\nJack is an adorable 3-month-old Blue Heeler blend who weighs approximately 4.1 pounds. Jack initially is shy but once you offer him treats, he quickly displays his affectionate and playful nature. His ideal owner should have experience with herding breeds as they often can require extra training and exercise than more sedentary breeds.\nPlease understand you are committing to providing a good home for his entire life (up to 15+ years or more) - not just until his puppy cuteness wears off.\nYou must be committed to housebreaking, age-appropriate enrichment and exercise, leash training, grooming needs, and positive socialization. Like most puppies, he may chew on anything within his reach to include but not limited to baseboards, shoes, socks, children's toys, electrical cords, plants, etc.\nHis adoption fee is $300. This includes his neuter surgery, rabies vaccination, Nobivac Canine 1-DAPP vaccinations, Bravecto, Drontal Plus, Tri-Heart Plus Chewable Tablet, 24PetWatch microchip, leash and collar, and a trial offer for 24PetWatch Pet Insurance.\nPlease be aware that puppies and small breed dogs do get adopted quickly so interested parties are encouraged to apply online at www.saspca.org.\nPlease ensure your application is complete before submitting. We do verify property ownership, landlord references, apartment/HOA restrictions, veterinary references, and criminal histories.\nOur adoption events are held each Saturday at Petco located in the Northwoods Shopping Center at 18138 San Pedro Ave, San Antonio TX 78232. Event hours are 11:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.\nAdditional questions may be directed to sagdinfo@gmail.com.\n** This dog is in a foster home in San Antonio, TX.

After a few baths, trips to the vet, lots of yummy food and rest- we got to see his sweet, funny personality come out! Bandit likes to talk and he can even jump up and open the door- so beware! He likes to jump and needs basic training. He is not squirrely and out of control. He is obedient and eager to please. This young boy just needs a family to call his own and a FUREVER home to keep him safe and provide him with the stability and love that he deserves. He wieghs 50 lbs and is newly vaccinated. His neuter appointment is on Feb. 10 and he will have a fancy microchip too! #WOOF",

I\u2019m a sweet young lady who came into the care of MUR for a Beat the Heat initiative, and decided to stick around! I\u2019ve been busy getting used to the city life and now I\u2019m ready to find a family to curl up beside.\n\nI am currently perfecting my leash manners, but walking is one of my favourite things to do so I know that practice will make perfect for me! I am fully house trained and am working on my kennel training, but I\u2019m so well behaved that I can be trusted loose. I live with a doggy foster sibling and enjoy their company, though sometimes I like my own space to relax. I would do best with respectful dogs and slow introductions so I can come out of my shell. That way I can be the best sister possible! I haven\u2019t met any cats or kids yet but I\u2019m sure with proper introductions, we could be great friends.\n\nI\u2019ve heard that \u201cslow and steady wins the race\u201d and I think the same goes for becoming best friends! I promise once I\u2019m comfortable, I will cuddle you to your heart's content. I also make a great hand warmer for humans and will gladly trade my services for some belly rubs anytime. If we get really cozy and relaxed one day, you may just be lucky enough to hear my pig impression! My foster family says my snort is adorable and I\u2019m pretty confident you\u2019ll agree.\n\nI know I\u2019ll make a great addition to your family. Are you ready for all this extra love? Apply to meet me today!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Because we do not have a public shelter, an adoption application must be filled out in order to be approved to meet any of our animals available for adoption. No exceptions. Serious inquiries only.",

I have a LOT of energy, so much that I shouldn't go to a home with small children or small animals (cats, little dogs). I have done well with other large dogs that like to roughhouse as much as I do, but I will need a slow and proper introduction to other dogs. I LOVE to play and go go go! It would be awesome to go on lots of adventures or have a big back yard to play in. I also LOVE people, I've never met a stranger. I would benefit from an experienced dog person who doesn't mind training a big goofball. I am a smart boy and would benefit greatly from training and a consistent owner. If that person is you, I will be your very best pal.",

She said she had rescued him after she found him emaciated but sadly he was living outside in a pen that he frequently escaped. About a year ago he escaped and came home with his leg injured, she brought him to the vet and they said his leg was fine how it was. Not sure of exact circumstances, but when an amazing volunteer went check on Buddy after he had been attacked by another dog, she knew he needed help immediately. He was taken to the ER where it was determined Buddy would have to have his leg amputated.\n\nBuddy is a very sweet affectionate boy, but because of his past he would do best with female dogs only. He is getting around just fine as a new tripod and ready to start his new life as a Diamond. Please apply today to meet Buddy!\n\nAdoption donation includes Spay/Neuter, UTD on Vaccinations, deworming, and flea treatment.",

Please read our Frequently Asked Questions and Adoption Processed Explained documentation.\n_________ B I O ______________\n\nName:Calabaza\nSize: ~Medium range: 26-60 lbs\nAdoption Donation:$250 (applicable sales tax included).Adoption fees may be paid by cash or check.\nOther:Spayed Female, Vaccinations current, Microchip\n\nCalabaza is a very nice dog and is friendly with people.\n\nFoster Home Feedback\n\n1/23/21: A few things to know about Calabaza - she loves to pounce in the snow. She isn't afraid to take walks regardless of it being a little cold or the amount of snow outside - I assume she may be a great running buddy as well. Calabaza has been great with an energetic puppy as well as an older dog that just wants to play in spurts and have his space at other times. She sleeps like a dream and has had no accidents in the house or the kennel. She is very photogenic! Sound great? Keep reading!\n\nCalabaza has great instincts about dogs as I stated before about being around an energetic puppy and an older dog. I would not say that Calabaza is overly energetic but she does love daily walks (sometimes begs for another with a nudge at her leash and the use of \"puppy eyes\"). She also loves playtime in the backyard chasing snowballs you throw! She is doing great taming a wild puppy foster right now - they have become almost instant best friends!\n\nI would say she would do best in a house with a dog buddy or if her adopter is a single dog lady, it would be best if she isn't left for long periods of time during the day as she isn't much for the alone time. She loves space to run and does find chasing rabbits and squirrels thrilling! Calabaza sprints and pounces outside daily with the other dogs. I have about a 4-5 foot fence and she has never tried to jump up on it, but with the right motivation, she very likely could.\n\nShe is a little skittish at first, but once you have her trust, Calabaza will be all about snuggles and getting pets. She loves a good window to look out of and does bark a little, but not too much. Currently, I do kennel her while I go to work for short stints of time, but mainly because I have 3 dogs in the house and the little puppy I have here now likely wouldn't leave her alone and may chew everything! She kennels well but doesn't love it.\n\nI do believe Calabaza would be perfectly fine to leave out during the day along with some things to keep her mind active. She does try to counter surf, so keep the buffet items to a minimum. Calabaza is definitely a special dog that loves being in a home and is learning new things every day! She can't wait to be a part of her forever home!\n\n**\nCalabaza is Lyme and Anaplasmosis positive.These are tick-borne illnesses, and she is currently being treated with Doxycycline.\n\nTo learn more about Anaplasmosis in dogs, read here: http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=2+2101&aid=3621\n\nTo learn more about Lyme disease in dogs, read here: http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=2+2102&aid=458 To view additional dogs available for adoption, please see our website: www.4luvofdog.org",

Meet Jean-Luc, the most handsome dog this side of France! He is an approximately 3 year old 35 pound male husky mix! \n\nOk, so he\u2019s not really from France. Jean-Luc came to speak from an awful puppy mill, with no positive human interaction. In a few weeks with his foster family, he has learned so many \u201cdog things\u201d like playing in the backyard with his doggy foster siblings, getting yummy treats, and sleeping on comfy beds! \n\nHe\u2019s such a smart boy and has picked up potty and crate training like a champ! He spends his day following his foster family around the house, though he would prefer to sit a few feet away. He\u2019s not comfortable enough to ask for pets yet, but once he\u2019s in his forever home, he should come out of his shell. \n\nJean-Luc\u2019s perfect home will have a fenced in yard to keep him safe, and another dog to keep him company. His future humans will need to be very patient with him as he continues to learn to be a pet. But once he\u2019s comfortable, this sweet boy will make a lucky family very happy! Apply to meet Jean-Luc today!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please review our adoption policies and apply online at [www.speakfortheunspoken.com/adopt](http://www.speakfortheunspoken.com/adopt).\n\nVisit [www.speakfortheunspoken.com](http://www.speakfortheunspoken.com/) will give you more information about our rescue.\n\n***PLEASE READ*** WE DO NOT RESPOND TO PETFINDER OR EMAIL INQUIRIES. Please fill out an application on our website if you are interested in adopting this dog. We will only set up a meeting with the dog once you have an approved adoption application. We actively manage our dogs on Petfinder, the dogs listed are available for adoption. We will remove the dog from view once they are pending adoption.",

We are looking for fosters or 'foster to adopt' w/ the knowledge that the meet on Sunday may be late at night & we will have vet apts for them to keep that week! They are fully vetted. Sofi is three years old, 37 lbs. One of the teachers from the school in Mitrovica, came across Sofi & her brother Sam shortly after birth.  We think the mother was killed.  After this teacher tried. she asked if I would take them.  Sam & Sofi were with me ever since.  Sam was adopted this past summer by a special young man who just adores him.  Sofi has always been the smallest/was picked on by the other dogs in the pack here.  I keep her right next to me even inside.   She is very faithful and loving.  She is very attached to me.  She would be a great dog for a single lady.  Very easy dog!\n***\nThank you for your interest in our rescues ! Events most every weekend, Saturdays, to meet some. All may be met by appointment w/ approved application. Facebook posts who will attend (current week).  Available dogs, donation button(we are non-profit) & links to adopt/volunteer www.lovemuttsrescue.org . We will email you our process & fees. When one is in \"foster to adopt\", they are taken off our website, but may be relisted w/in 2 weeks, if not a final adoption. Blessings, The Love Mutts Rescue Team",

Her disposition is sunny and bright! Lady enjoys being inside and outside, especially sunbathing in the warm sun. She was found in the street with no microchip,  \n\nPlease contact Samira at 682-561-0448 if you would like to add sweet Lady to you home.

He is doing OK on a his leash training and on his potty training. \n\nMudflap loves people, dogs, kids and cats but he is afraid of chickens! He loves to snuggle and be with his people and would love nothing more than an active family to run and hike with!\n\nInterested in becoming a forever home for Mudflap? Fill out our online adoption application: http://www.friendswithfourpaws.org/adoption-form.html This is the first step in our process, and we don't go any further without an application.\n\nFind more adoptable pets, news and information on Instagram @friendswithfourpaws or our Facebook page Friends with Four Paws .\n\nWe put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them and you.  Please do not submit an application if you are not serious about adopting Mudflap.\nWe are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and Mudflap the perfect forever home, and appreciate you working with us.  \nFor immediate consideration, please attach your application to the initial inquiry to help us expedite the process.\n\nOur adoption fee is $525. This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.\n\nAll of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements for transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home AFTER an application is being processed.\n\nThank you in advance for your patience with our process and for making adoption YOUR option!",

His green eyes are mesmerizing as he pays close attention to his surroundings, and his expressive eyebrows, pink nose, and fluffy tail wrap up the one of the kind package for this tender hearted guy. \n\nHe has been in an amazing foster home and has made great strides in his socialization skills. He is fully leash and house trained and has done well with other dogs in his foster home. He is a little shy and nervous around new people, but he will trust you when given time and patience.\n\nEarl loves snuggling on the couch, a soft bed, good food and going for walks. Most everything is a new experience for him so patience is vital. It will take time to earn his trust and affection but it's so worth the extra effort!",

Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements for transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home AFTER an application is being processed.\n\nThank you in advance for your patience with our process and for making adoption YOUR option!",

            "description": "Apply to Adopt Me!\n\nBaby is a 1-year-old sweet girl with plenty of energy. She is great with adults, children and other dogs. She is curious around cats but doesn't chase. She weighs 42 lbs. and needs a forever home where someone can spend time with her including daily exercise. She needs training to be the best girl she can be. Her foster mom is working with her on the leash, sometimes she is better than other times. Riding in the car isn't her most favorite thing to do, and does better in the car with another pup. She can be a vocal girl, ready to sound the alarm when danger is near. It seems she hasn't had a lot of toys in her life, and is learning how fun those are to play with. She loves playing with her foster mom's younger male dog. We are requiring a minimum 6-ft. fenced-in yard for her. If you live in the central Florida (Orlando) area and think you have the perfect forever home for Baby, we'd love to find out more about you. Please fill in our adoption application and we'll see if you're Baby's perfect match.",

            "description": "Sasha is a beautiful tan and white chihuahua with a date of birth of 9/26/13. She is spayed, up to date on vaccinations and being kept on heartworm and flea and tick prevention to maintain her good health. She is very loving with her foster mom but will take some time to adjust to the person that adopts her. She did not care for the stranger in the mask that came to take her pictures. Due to her fearful nature, she will not be considered for a family with children. She tolerates the other dogs in her foster home but definitely feels like she is the boss. Sasha\u2019s adoption donation is $225. If you would like to adopt Sasha please complete the first step in the adoption process by filling out our online adoption application. You can find the link to our on-line adoption application at www.arfarkansas.com on the right-hand side of our home page. An application does not obligate you to adopt from us, but it does show that you are serious about the adoption process. Please remember our organization is staffed completely by volunteers.\nPlease Note: All applications are processed in the order received, but an adoption is made to the best application received for each of our animals. All applicants must provide a vet reference on the adoption application. If you are adopting a dog from ARFA, a fenced in yard for the dog will be required. Home visits often occur with each adoption. ARFA has the right to deny adoption to any applicant for any reason without explanation. Please remember that the adoption donation is not for purchase of a dog, but rather to cover the medical cost of all dogs in our care.\nTHE FINE PRINT\n1.  Animal Rescue Fund Arkansas reserves the right to deny any application, for any reason without explanation to the applicant.\n2.  You understand that we often take many applications on the same animal and that they are processed in the order that they come in. An application is in no way a reservation for any animal or a guarantee that you will be selected to adopt the animal.\n3.  If your application Is approved, you will be asked to sign a separate adoption contract.\n4.  Once the trial period is over, usually 1 week unless there are special circumstances, the adoption donation cannot be returned to you for any reason. It will have been used to help rescue another homeless animal and is no longer available therefore, if you return the dog to us for any reason, you will not be refunded your donation.\n5.  If the animal you want to adopt is placed in another home, you can transfer your application to another A.R.F.A. animal without completing additional paperwork.\n6.  You understand that this is a rescued pet. We rarely have any information about their past life circumstances.  We have all animals examined by a vet, brought up to date on shots, given their rabies vaccine, spayed/neutered (If old enough), wormed and checked for heartworms and if positive begin treatment.  We do our best to ensure that we are placing healthy pets but can make no guarantee to the health or temperament of this pet, and vet expenses are the responsibility of the adoptive family from the date of the adoption.  We require that you take the pet to a vet within one week of adoption for a check-up and to allow your vet to get a baseline for your new pet\u2019s health.\n",

I come from Texas, where there is no snow and I have to tell you that I was missing out! I can't get enough of it. It is so fun! I am potty trained and I sit patiently at the door when I need to go out. Have I told you yet that I love FOOD. It must be the puppy in my because sometimes I steal my foster siblings dog food. My foster mom says I am just a pup at around 7 months old and that I am all legs. She jokes that I might be part greyhound because I am so fast. I love everybody but do need slow introductions. Once I have met you, look out! I give endless hugs and kisses and I really want to sleep in bed with you. I believe the humans call it cuddling and I love it! I love my fur foster brothers but boy do I think the chickens are fun to chase, so I guess a home without them would be ideal. My adoption fee is $400.00 plus MN tax. This covers my spay and vaccinations up to the time of adoption. To apply please visit northernlakesrescue.org Breeds are best guess as we do not know who mom and dad are",

Even though I am just a little guy (with a big personality!), I get along great with my big dog friends. There's been a cat around too and I am not so sure about her. I feel like I should chase her, but I'm working on holding back. I came all the way from South of Houston, so I am not a big fan of the snow and the cold. I have a nice little coat that helps me stay warmer outside. Sometimes, I am nice and I pee outside, but this has been a work in progress. It's just so cold out there! I am motivated by treats (except anything with peanut butter), and learned SIT very quickly. We are working on more commands. I really like my kennel. It is my safe zone and I stay in there during the day while the humans are at work and at night, when we sleep. Some of my favorite things? Snuggling on the couch next to the humans! Be patient with me because I am afraid of shouts or raised voices. I am weary of males, but I just need a little bit of time to gain their trust. I can't wait to meet you!

Her mom is a full blood schnauzer however we are not sure what her dad is but believe he was a larger dog so she will likely be a smaller medium sized dog full grown.\n\nOpal is a puppy so she gets along with everyone and everything. She will require a home that will continue puppy training. \n\nSince she is a mix she is likely not hypoallergenic \nShe will require another canine playmate in her home \nShe will require a fenced yard \nWe do check vet references. \n\nHer adoption fee is $125.00",

Leo is part of the China Rescue Dogs mission to save 60 small breed dogs from the meat trade before the Chinese New Year celebrations. We know Leo was likely someone\u2019s pet that was discarded in March or April after the start of COVID when it was wrongly believed that pets carried the virus. Not true! It was somewhere around this time he was rescued and placed in a foster home. For months Leo has been in a boarding facility getting up to date on his vaccinations, neuter ,quarantine, passport and then finally his flight to New York USA!! Leo arrived today  in Wisconsin and is the biggest love!! He is the happiest and sweetest boy! He loves everyone he meets. He does well with other dogs and surprisingly doesn\u2019t have an resource guarding issues!! Leo is crate trained however he may not be receptive the crate after arrival. He will need help to reestablish housetraining after travel and being in a boarding facility. He does currently mark but with time may improve. He will come with belly bands that fit around his midsection and will help him with his marking issues. He is in perfect health and is fully up to date on all of his vaccinations, tests, and neuter. He will be microchipped and will be registered to Lucky Dog Rescue for the rest of his life. Leo\u2019s adoption fee will not be inexpensive. Due to border closures and needing to fly cargo, his flight alone with all the fees without medical care was $500. We are asking $750 minimally but appreciate anything beyond that to help other China dogs. Leo\u2019s entire fee will be going back to Chinarescuedogs.org to help get other dogs to freedom in the US. With all of our adoptions if at any point the adoption isn\u2019t successful within the first two weeks the entire adoption fee is returned. After the two weeks of the dogs need to be rehomed for any reason the dogs must be returned to the rescue. Leo will be a great addition to any active household that can be patient with his re-housetraining.",

Her owner rescued her from a difficult situation but is not allowed to permanently keep a dog in her current home.  Lola is just 20 months old, has a pretty blue merle coat, and she is a great weight at 40 pounds.  She is spayed, up to date on all of her vaccines and is on monthly preventatives.  Lola is housebroken, crate-trained and knows her basic obedience commands.  She walks nicely on leash and loves to ride in the car.\nLola loves people!  She is a high Velcro girl who loves to be wherever her people are.  Lola is also a medium to high energy dog who loves other dogs.  Lola enjoys so many different activities \u2013 fetching balls and toys, running and chase, tug of war, swimming, chasing birds, making noise with her squeaky toys \u2013 you name it!  And when all the fun is done Lola has a great \u201coff switch\u201d.  She loves belly rubs!  Lola has not been introduced to cats but given her prey drive her home should probably not include resident cats.\nThe ideal home for Lola is loving and active, shared with someone who is looking for a true best friend.  A fenced yard and another playful young dog would be ideal, and because children make her nervous her new home should include no children under the age of 12.  Lola deserves an amazing home, and if you are looking for an amazing Lola, please contact her owner directly at beachmama1010@yahoo.com.  Lola currently lives near Wilmington, NC.\n",

            "description": "Meet CHANCE! \n\nChance is an approximately 7 year old male pittie or staffie mix.  He currently weighs around 60 lbs and is fully vetted. \n\nWe believe that  he can be socialized with bigger dogs, not the tiny ones however.   Chance is very affectionate with people, especially someone he bonds with.  \n\nHere is Chance's story prior to us saving him:  \n\nHello, my name is Chance, and I live all by myself in an empty house in Asheville, NC. It\u2019s cold and lonely here, and I remember how much I have loved the companionship of human beings, cuddling on a coach to keep everyone warm. I lived for the last 7 years of my life with my Dad, who adopted me when I was a puppy. We were pals and lived a nice bachelor life, but a few months ago, my Dad moved me in with his girlfriend, who has a smaller dog. The smaller dog and I got into a scuffle and now I am never allowed to live with my Dad again. He comes to feed me once a day in this house I live in all alone and the nights are long and the days are cold. My Dad loves me as much as he knows how to, and does not want me to go to a shelter, where I\u2019ll probably be forever lost. So, a nice lady stepped in who is trying to find me a home.  I can probably do okay with other dogs around my size, just not the little ones.  I do great with people, and I\u2019d love a nice yard too.\n\nPlease help us give Chance the loving, forever home he deserves that won't abandon him again.   \n\nIf interested, please contact Christine at christinerescueexpress@gmail.com",

He is working on house-training and basic commands.  Pugsly is a typical snorty and panting mini-tank, so Pug experience is preferred. Pugsly will be up to date on all vaccinations, and will be microchipped before adoption. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please review our adoption policies and apply online at [www.speakfortheunspoken.com/adopt](http://www.speakfortheunspoken.com/adopt).\n\nVisit [www.speakfortheunspoken.com](http://www.speakfortheunspoken.com/) will give you more information about our rescue.\n\n***PLEASE READ*** WE DO NOT RESPOND TO PETFINDER OR EMAIL INQUIRIES. Please fill out an application on our website if you are interested in adopting this dog. We will only set up a meeting with the dog once you have an approved adoption application. We actively manage our dogs on Petfinder, the dogs listed are available for adoption. We will remove the dog from view once they are pending adoption.\n\n\n\n\n",

We think these pups will be medium to large 45-60#\n\nThese are very social and friendly puppies who love people and cats and kids.\n\nMindy Cali has your average puppy personality: silly, goofy, sweet, loving and AWESOME. \n\nInterested in becoming a forever home for Mindy Cali? Fill out our online adoption application: http://www.friendswithfourpaws.org/adoption-form.html This is the first step in our process, and we don't go any further without an application.\n\nFind more adoptable pets, news and information on Instagram @friendswithfourpaws or our Facebook page Friends with Four Paws .\n\nWe put a lot of time and energy into processing our adoptions to find our babies the best fit home for them and you.  Please do not submit an application if you are not serious about adopting Mindy Cali.\nWe are so excited to work with you to find you a new forever friend, and Mindy Cali the perfect forever home, and appreciate you working with us.  \n\nOur adoption fee is $525. This includes their spay/neuter surgery, full (age appropriate) vaccinations, microchip insertion and registration, deworming, heartworm testing and prevention, flea and tick prevention and travel expenses.\n\nAll of our dogs are rescued from local shelters and the general public. Each dog is then placed in a foster home where he/she is kept for quarantine, to ensure if the dog gets sick it can receive proper treatment. We have foster homes in the NJ/NY area waiting to receive their fosters. Once an animal has received an application or there's an adopter interested, we make arrangements for transport. If a dog is already in foster care in NYC/NJ, an adopter will be put in touch with the foster home AFTER an application is being processed.\n\nThank you in advance for your patience with our process and for making adoption YOUR option!",

Their former owner moved into a residence that doesn't allow dogs so he took them to a high kill shelter in So. CA.  They are brother and sister, 8 years of age (Rosa, 13 lbs. and Fredrick 9 lbs.).  The chances of them being euthanized was high and I feel sure there is a wonderful home that will love and protect these two sweet dogs.  Both Fredrick and Rosa love to be loved.  They ride wonderfully in a car.\n\nTheir adoption fee will cover updating their shots and for Rosa to be spayed at the Homeward Bound Spay/Neuter Clinic in McMinnville.  A friend of mine is currently fostering these littles in Springfield. Adoption fee: $400 for the pair.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Rosa and Fredrick, please respond with information about you/your family; what other pets you have; how they will fit into your life.\n\nIf you are reading this, they are available.",

I am a two year old male Bull Terrier and Corgi mix with the prettiest blue eyes.  I am neutered, up to date on all of my vaccinations, and microchipped.  I know all of my basic commands and am a very fast learner.  My favorite past times are walks, hikes, and runs.  If you can't tell, I am a very active guy but love to snuggle any chance I get.  I like to be close to my person and will be right next to you whenever I can be.  Don't worry though!  I am crate trained and have no problem with alone time... just leave me some toys ;)  I LOVE treats and will go gaga for them.  However, I do not like to share.  I will do best in a home with no other dogs and no little kids.  I currently live with my human and a sister, Luna.  Unfortunately, Luna and I compete over food.  We are working very hard with a trainer but my human wants to keep her options open so I can have the best life possible.

Their former owner moved into a residence that doesn't allow dogs so he took them to a high kill shelter in So. CA.  They are brother and sister, 8 years of age (Rosa, 13 lbs. and Fredrick 9 lbs.).  The chances of them being euthanized was high and I feel sure there is a wonderful home that will love and protect these two sweet dogs.  Both Fredrick and Rosa love to be loved.  They ride wonderfully in a car.\n\nTheir adoption fee will cover updating their shots and for Rosa to be spayed at the Homeward Bound Spay/Neuter Clinic in McMinnville.  A friend of mine is currently fostering these littles in Springfield.  Adoption fee: $400 for the pair.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Rosa and Fredrick, please respond with information about you/your family; what other pets you have; how they will fit into your life.\n\nIf you are reading this, they are available.",

I\u2019m 3 years old and 30 lbs! \n\nI just arrived to ODHS but the humans promised to update my bio as they learn more about me! \n\nYou can still come adopt me or even join our foster program to help the humans learn all the awesome things about new dogs like me! Learn more on our website! \n\nHope to see you soon! \n\nWhat breed am I? Mixed mutt! ODHS does not breed label (unless there\u2019s official paperwork), as studies show it is nearly impossible to tell the exact breed of each dog based off of their appearance.\n\nEducational articles:\n3/3/3 Rule;\nhttps://www.rescuedogs101.com/bringing-new-dog-home-3-3-3-rule/?fbclid=IwAR2iv5m7fqk3FieO7LOsstGeGsYYV_F1rJOd1BPxaImofLpcinpYsUbFRWs\n\nAdoption Donations are $250 for an adult, $350 for puppies (a dog under one year of age), and $125 for a senior dog (based on the age of the dog). Adoption donations are to be made via cash, and credit/debit card. There is a $5 fee to run cards.\n\nPlease remember to bring a collar and leash (non-retractable) with you the day of the adoption. Note: Martingale collars and slip leads are strongly recommended.\n\nDue to COVID19, we aren't having as many open, public adoption events.  Current schedule is pre-determined meet and greet appointments are Wednesday evenings and on Saturdays. \nOur adoption center is located at 3602 Lafayette Blvd, Suite 102, Fredericksburg, VA 22408. It's important that you keep an eye on your emails for any changes or updates during the adoption process.\n\nVisit our website for an application to adopt. \nhttps://www.olddominionhumanesociety.org/adoption-application\n\nOld Dominion Humane Society is a volunteer based organization. We are run completely by volunteers, who also have full time jobs, so we appreciate your patience.  Currently, the average timeframe for a response to your application is 1 week.\n\nLike us on Facebook \"Old Dominion Humane Society\"\nand be a part of promoting forever homes for dogs in need.\n#Adopt #Donate #Foster #Volunteer \n\nNote: ODHS only adopts to Virginia and surrounding states (including D.C.). A $50 out of state fee applies.",

I will play with all the toys you buy me, I love toys! I do want to be an only child as I have been bullied by other dogs and they beat me up, but I have healed up really good, just a little nervous around other dogs...I just wanted to play! My foster brothers have been nice to me. Please share my picture because I know my forever mom and dad are looking for me. I sure wish they could find me. I am ready to be theirs forever. Thank you!\n\nHe's a little chihuahua. He was attacked by some dogs. His face has healed he has a little bit of a bum eye, but he is as sweet and as cute as can be and just needs a forever lap. He will expect lots of kisses and hugs and of course will return them as well. Let me know if you have a loving place in your heart and home for this sweet boy. He would do well in a home as the only dog as he now has trust issues with dogs. He gets along with small dogs with the correct introduction.\n\nThis boy has been let down too many times. He landed in a shelter and then was attacked by dogs there. He is so sweet but was so scared. \n\nAll Dallas DogRRR adoptable pets are spayed or neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines upon finalizing adoption. The standard minimum donation for puppies is $325 + 8.25% tax = $351.81, for dogs over 12 months the adoption fee is $225 + 8.25% tax = $243.66 and for our senior dogs 8 years and up is $100 + 8.25% tax = $108.25; this increase includes sales tax recently required by the State of Texas to collect. You can view all the adoptable pets and fill out an adoption application online on our website at http://dallasdogrrr.org. \n\nFor more information, you can email adopt@dallasdogrrr.org. Upon receiving your application please allow us 2-3 business days to review and process.",

I don't care how old you are or what you look like, but in case those things matter to you, I'm approximately a year old and that's me in the picture with the silky, soft fur and gorgeous eyes! My perfect match would be someone who loves spending time with their best friend, I'm down for anything, from movie dates on the couch to sky diving. I'm your ride or die. I don't mean to brag, but people tell me I'm a lot like LeonardoDiCaprio in The Titanic because I have stunning eyes and am completely devoted to those I love. When I'm not admiring your every move, I'd love to be playing with other dogs. So, what do you say? Wanna be besties? Do you want a dog who can live with kitties and not bother them? That's me! I don't bother kitties at all. Got kids? No problem, I love 'em! Sounds like I check all of your boxes, doesn't it!? If so, just fill out an application for me at www.pawsitivetailskc.org, and we can set up a time to meet! My adoption fee is $150 and I'm up to date on vaccines, dewormed, heartworm negative, current on flea and heartworm prevention, neutered and I'm even microchipped! Come meet me today, bestie!",

Winter will make a wonderful addition to some lucky family. She has a typical puppy personality...fun, affectionate, playful, and active.\nShe will need an adopter that has the time and resources to raise a puppy and offer positive reinforcement training.\nWinter is up to date on vaccines (but will need boosters), and is spayed.  She has no special needs.\nHome ownership required.\nApplications can be found at www.southsidespca.org\nApplications are given precedence over emails and phone calls.\n",

            "description": "Kavik boy is ready to steal someone's heart! <3\n\n\"Kavik is a handsome little guy. He has the cutest little dot on the middle of his head. Kavik is a mix of playful and calm. He is a bit more independent than his siblings, but still enjoys cuddles. He is outgoing and typically one of the first ones out of the kennel. Kavik has the kind of personality that would fit into pretty much any household! <3\" \n\nKavik is a 6 week old male Great Pyrenees mix. He currently weighs about 10lbs. Our best guess is he will top out somewhere in the 80-90lb range. \n\n-Kavik has been with us since birth. His mom Varity came to us heavily pregnant. We are unsure of who his dad was. Varity's former owner believes it was a male Pyr mix who visits sometimes but doesn't know for sure. \n\n-Kavik is still a baby. This means his new family needs to be ready to potty train him, work with him on basic manners, and have a lot of time on their hands to help raise him. \n\n-Kavik will need proper socialization. His new family will need to expose him to a little bit of everything. Such as walks, car rides, public outings, visitors, other dogs, etc. \n\n-Kavik will not be ready to go home until February 22, give or take a couple of days. Anyone applying to adopt him needs to be able to bring him home close to that date. \n\n-Kavik is being fostered in Kiowa, OK. We do not send our dogs on transports or ship them. This means his new family needs to pick him up, even if they are out of state. \n\nWant to make this cutie pie yours? Apply to adopt him at https://www.pyrpawsandfluffytailsrescue.com/adoption-app\n\nHis adoption fee is $275. That includes two sets of puppy shots, bordetella, and rabies. He will be micro-chipped, have a fecal done, be de-wormed, be spayed/neutered, and will be current on my heart-worm and flea/tick prevention.",

I get along with all the dogs and cats in my foster home. I'm not fond of little children but teenagers can be ok. I'm very shy and it takes a bit for me to trust you. But once you show me you love me and feed me treats I do come around and follow you everywhere. I am house and crate trained. I'm not a fan of a crate but I do get used to it. I can do a few tricks. I sit and beg(mom says sit up). I could learn more with work. I can be very nervous at going outside at first so a good fenced yard is important. I've been vetted, spayed, microchipped and flea treated. If you would like a girl like me then complete an application here\nhttps://www.pethelpersinc.org/adoption-application/\n. And the adoption fee is $150.\n\nFor more information on this animal email adoptionisforever@pethelpersinc.org.\n\nPet Helpers is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit foster based volunteer rescue located in Fairmont, WV. We do adopt out of state to approved applicants, if you are willing to drive to WV to pick up your pet. We do not fly or use transport companies. Our adoption fee is $150.00 for mixed breed puppies and adult dogs, $225.00 for full blooded puppies and adult dogs and $50.00 for cats and kittens. Regardless if the animal is a mixed breed or full blooded they are spayed/neutered prior to adoption IF they are old enough. If they are too young at the time of adoption, then it is your financial responsibility to spay/neuter the pet by the age of 6 months and you must provide proof for our files that it has been done. All of our pets are checked by a vet, given the shots appropriate for their age and any other treatment deemed necessary by the vet. All of our pets are adopted as indoor pets and are not be outdoors tied to a box 24/7. The pet you are adopting has been living in a home with a foster family. You are expected to take possession of the pet you are applying for within a few days of application approval. This will enable us to accept another pet into that home. Because we are a rescue, and believe that spaying and neutering is crucial in stopping the reproduction of unwanted puppies/kittens and massive amounts of animals dying daily in shelters across the country, we expect any animal already in your home to be spayed/neutered. If for any reason you are unable to keep the pet you have adopted you are required to return them to Pet Helpers, Inc. They are not to be sold or given away.\n\nCheck us out on Facebook!!!!!! We hope you will give us two paws up, like our page and share with your friends. Pet Helpers, Inc.",

            "description": "Isn\u2019t two always better than one? When it comes to cuteness in smaller packages, we\u2019ve got that covered. We are dynamic duo Henry and Millie - a bonded pair of miniature Australian Shepherds. We were found running down a street. No one claimed us so we are now looking for our forever home! If you are looking for cuddles, tons of moments of cuteness, softness and more cuddles, we are the puppies you have been looking for.\nHenry is approximately 8 years old and 25 lbs. Millie is 6 years old and 18 lbs. It\u2019s clear someone took care of us and did some training. We are typical herding dogs, and need to make sure we are in charge of what\u2019s happening. \nWe love having a crate to den in and puppy beds. Millie loves her toys. She will flip them in the air and retrieve like a labrador! She also loves to guard her toys and makes lots of noise if other puppies come by them. It\u2019s all noise. She also LOVES to cuddle on your lap belly up in the air for rubs. Henry is also a lab buddy. He can jump very high and may land in your lap at any time so be ready! Henry is a couch potato. A flat pillow on the couch is the perfect perch for him. \nWe are quite smart and understand several commands. We are very treat motivated. We are fully potty trained \u2013 you can say go potty and we will run outside and potty immediately. We come when called. Millie is quite the character, she loves to pull toys under the table when she thinks no one is looking. And if you say Millie Bell in a high pitched voice, she will wiggle her whole butt and look at you like you are the most loved human in the world. We both really enjoy when you sit on the floor with us.\nWe are pretty perfect, but we do have a couple things that need work. We bark if we hear a lot of activity happening in the yard but interestingly don\u2019t bark at the doorbell and don\u2019t bark if we go by houses with barking dogs. We walk well on a leash, but we are reactive barkers when we see people or dogs. If you turn us in the other direction and redirect our attention, we calm down quickly. It will take some consistent training to get us past this. Apartment living or tight living quarters with a lot of activity will not be a good fit for us. Henry can be a little fussy with some men. He does best if you let him come to you first as he is getting to know you. He has done very well with his foster dad and foster grandpa. It just takes him a little while to settle in and then he will begin to come by with finger licks. Small children are likely not a good fit due to the tendency for quick movements that could cause anxiety.  \nIf you are looking for lots of cuddles and can provide a loving environment, we can complete your family and bring you so much joy.   Adoption fee:  $400 for both.  For more information, please email:  Avrisundell@gmail.com\n\n",

He's located in Tampa.\n\nThis is Oscar. He came into rescue last Wednesday after having been in the shelter since November. He's an approx 2 year old lab mix, 50 lbs. who is incredibly friendly and loving. Does great with new people and other dogs on walks. He's a strong boy so someone needs to know how to walk him appropriately. Lots of energy. Oscar is fully vetted, neutered and heartworm negative. PUPDATE ON OSCAR!!",

She's almost house trained, she wasn't sure how to ask to go out at first but with consistency she should be trained pretty easily. She settles quickly in her kennel now that she has settled into my routine. She walks great on a leash, has been my shadow the last few days and loves demanding pets by pushing her cold nose under your hand.\n\nShe does have a habit of jumping up for attention, petting, and during any excitement. She corrects easily and with consistency you could break this habit, I would be mindful of young kids due to it. She will also jump up to check out what's on the counter or table. - foster mom Mackenzie",

            "description": "Isn\u2019t two always better than one? When it comes to cuteness in smaller packages, we\u2019ve got that covered. We are dynamic duo Henry and Millie - a bonded pair of miniature Australian Shepherds. We were found running down a street. No one claimed us so we are now looking for our forever home! If you are looking for cuddles, tons of moments of cuteness, softness and more cuddles, we are the puppies you have been looking for.\nHenry is approximately 8 years old and 25 lbs. Millie is 6 years old and 18 lbs. It\u2019s clear someone took care of us and did some training. We are typical herding dogs, and need to make sure we are in charge of what\u2019s happening. \nWe love having a crate to den in and puppy beds. Millie loves her toys. She will flip them in the air and retrieve like a labrador! She also loves to guard her toys and makes lots of noise if other puppies come by them. It\u2019s all noise. She also LOVES to cuddle on your lap belly up in the air for rubs. Henry is also a lab buddy. He can jump very high and may land in your lap at any time so be ready! Henry is a couch potato. A flat pillow on the couch is the perfect perch for him. \nWe are quite smart and understand several commands. We are very treat motivated. We are fully potty trained \u2013 you can say go potty and we will run outside and potty immediately. We come when called. Millie is quite the character, she loves to pull toys under the table when she thinks no one is looking. And if you say Millie Bell in a high pitched voice, she will wiggle her whole butt and look at you like you are the most loved human in the world. We both really enjoy when you sit on the floor with us.\nWe are pretty perfect, but we do have a couple things that need work. We bark if we hear a lot of activity happening in the yard but interestingly don\u2019t bark at the doorbell and don\u2019t bark if we go by houses with barking dogs. We walk well on a leash, but we are reactive barkers when we see people or dogs. If you turn us in the other direction and redirect our attention, we calm down quickly. It will take some consistent training to get us past this. Apartment living or tight living quarters with a lot of activity will not be a good fit for us. Henry can be a little fussy with some men. He does best if you let him come to you first as he is getting to know you. He has done very well with his foster dad and foster grandpa. It just takes him a little while to settle in and then he will begin to come by with finger licks. Small children are likely not a good fit due to the tendency for quick movements that could cause anxiety.  \nIf you are looking for lots of cuddles and can provide a loving environment, we can complete your family and bring you so much joy.   Adopted with Millie:  $400 for both.  More information, please email Avrisundell@gmail.com\n\n",

I love to get belly rubs and lots of affection. I'm a curious girl and I love going on walks. I'm pretty mellow for my age, but don't let my chill demeaner fool you, I definitely have my bursts of energy so I'll love to run around in a yard and go on lots of walks with you.

In Roman mythology, Aurora is the goddess of sunrise, which makes sense because this girl will bring nothing but sunshine to your life! Aurora is one of the shelters newest residents, but trust us when we say she won\u2019t be with us for long! It doesn\u2019t take any time at all to realize that Aurora is a perfect companion for any family. She\u2019s sweet, smart, and so loving. She\u2019ll crawl right up into your lap and give a kiss, but when you\u2019re ready to play, she\u2019ll be right by your side for any adventure you have in mind. We can tell she\u2019s a young girl, but she is wise beyond her years. She has a beautiful brindle coat with the perfect white accents on all four of her feet, her belly, and the tips of her nose and tail. Ask us how to meet this goddess today!\nPlease stop by the City of Jackson Animal Shelter at 140 Outer Circle, Jackson, MS during their adoption hr (10 - 4 M - F and 8:30-10:30 Sat) to meet Aurora and take a leash with you so that you can take her outside for a walk and get to know her a little better.  For more information, please contact Kristianna (a volunteer with Jxn Friends of the Animal Shelter) via phone (410-924-1053) or email (ksaelensybk2@yahoo.com). Aurora is eligible for a free spay thru Jackson Friends of the Animal Shelter.  For more pictures and information, please take a look at our Jackson Friends of the Animal Shelter page on Facebook.",

(I found Agima early one morning when I arrived at school. She was maybe 6 weeks old. She went to the front door of the school and just sat there, wouldn\u2019t leave.  I begged others to please take her as I already had a handful.  But if i didn\u2019t take her, the school guards would remove her and put her somewhere. So I took her home and she joined Mika. In June we take our students camping. I had no one to look after Mika and Agima, so they came camping.  They were so well behaved and the kids loved having them)\n\n We do not know breed mix of these 3 dogs. The arrival is planned for Feb. 27th into JFK, then transported to Raleigh. We are looking for fosters or 'foster to adopt' w/ the knowledge that the meet on Sunday may be late at night & we will have vet apts for them to keep that week! They are fully vetted.\n***\nThank you for your interest in our rescues ! Events most every weekend, Saturdays, to meet some. All may be met by appointment w/ approved application. Facebook posts who will attend (current week).  Available dogs, donation button(we are non-profit) & links to adopt/volunteer www.lovemuttsrescue.org . We will email you our process & fees. When one is in \"foster to adopt\", they are taken off our website, but may be relisted w/in 2 weeks, if not a final adoption. Blessings, The Love Mutts Rescue Team",

            "description": "# 705770 Age: 5 years Weight: 14.9 lbs How this pet arrived:This pet was brought in by a Good Samaritan on January 21, 2020.Why this pet is the one for you: Meet Sleepy everyone! He has come along away and our trainers are excited by the progress he has made while being in our care. He was very afraid when he arrived and it took a while for him to gain the trust of his caregivers. He is slowly getting his confidence back and he is ready for his new best friend! Once given the chance to warm up, you will see what a bouncy, silly and loving little companion he can be! Sleepy is looking forward to continuing his positive reinforcement and positive association training with his new family. Sleepy would do best in an small, adult home with a family that can listen to direction. Older teenagers might be okay if they know how to read dog body language! Sleepy came in with his siblings but his confidence only improved once he was separated from them. He would be happiest as the only dog in the home. We think he wants all the love and attention for himself! Sleepy can't wait to find his new best friend. Could it be you he has been waiting for? Click on the \"Adopt Me\" button and follow the steps towards his adoption! Primary Color: Brown Weight: 14.6lbs Age: 5yrs 2mths 1wks Animal has been Neutered",

Tumbleweed is a 13 year young 12 lb soft coat terrier that immediately caught the eye of one of our fosters who has a soft spot for the oldies but goodies. Tumbleweed is such a gentle and sweet gal. Not to mention she's pretty darn cute with her tussle of silver hair. \n\nTumbleweed makes a great co-pilot and enjoys going for car rides and running errands with her foster mommy. She is an easy going gal and is well mannered in the home. She is doing great with her potty routine, but we expect a few accidents when transitioning to a new home. Tumbleweed gets along well with other dogs, cats and new people she meets. She walks well on leash, and would love to continue those with her new family. \n\nTumbleweed can only hear loud noises, but her heart is in great shape, her eyesight is good and she got an A+ on her bloodwork. Her vetting is complete which includes a dental, so her mouth is in kissable shape when she meets you. The ideal home for Tumbleweed would be a home on the quiet side with someone who enjoys going for walks and cuddle time on the couch. An owner who is looking for a sweet senior to spend their golden years with. Could that be you?\n\nTumbleweed\u2019s adoption fee is $150 and that includes her spay, registered microchip, vaccines current, deworming, flea treatment and her dental. Apply to meet her at www.lovebugsrescue.org",

Roxy is a 50lb lap dog who loves to play and be a couch potato with you. Everyone who meets her falls in love and so will you. Roxy has had a rough couple years, she was surrendered by her first owner because the other dogs she lived with started bullying her and Roxy wouldn\u2019t defend herself thus leading to injuries (successfully treated by her veterinarian). Roxy\u2019s new owner then had her world change when they moved back with family while their home was being built. The chaos was too much for all the dogs and Roxy ended up surrendered again. Roxy is perfect and her perfect home is quiet, only dog or small dogs, she loves kids and is great with cats too! Please consider giving Roxy her forever home! She was born in 2016 and is located in a foster home. \n\nIncluded with adoption: Age-appropriate vaccinations, up to date heart-worm preventative, heart-worm test if over 6 months, insurance for 30 days, microchip with registration, and spayed or neutered- if not already, a voucher is provided. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete our Pre-application: https://form.jotform.us/asr628/ShortAdoptionInquiry",

            "description": "Skye is a wonderful and very playful 3 1/2 month old puppy. She and her sister, Betty Lou have been amazing around their human foster's 5 year old. The puppies were quite shy at first but that has not lasted long. Both really like to play fetch but Skye is the one who makes sure the toy gets brought back to be thrown again....Betty Lou would rather hide or play with the toy. Betty Lou, the more timid of the two has warmed up quickly and will come right up wanting to be petted. So far, the pups have done well with having only a couple accidents and have done well with training in the short time we have had them. They are both going to be great forever friends to there new family.\n________________________ This puppy's adoption fee is $400. This does NOT include spay/neuter.\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application and a representative will get back to you shortly to answer any questions you may have. The adoption policies and applications can be found at the following links: www.tinyurl.com/fcrtcats / www.tinyurl.com/fcrtdogs. Email us at adoption@fancycats.org for general questions about our rescued cats. Email us at dogadoptions@fancycats.org for general questions about our rescued dogs.\nYou can save animals like this one by becoming a foster! Fosters are like bridges between high kill shelters and forever homes. We need fosters so that we can save cats and dogs before they are euthanized at the shelters.

            "description": "Betty Lou is a wonderful and very playful 3 1/2 month old puppy. She has been amazing around the foster's 5 year old child! Both Betty Lou & her sister, Skye, were quite shy at first but that did not lasted long. Both really like to play fetch, Skye is the one who makes sure the toy gets brought back to be thrown again....Betty Lou would rather hide or play with the toy. Betty Lou, the more timid of the two has warmed up quickly and will come right up wanting to be petted. So far, the pups have done well with having only a couple accidents and have done well with training in the short time we have had them. They are both going to be great forever friends to there new family.\n________________________ This puppy's adoption fee is $400. This does NOT include spay/neuter.\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application and a representative will get back to you shortly to answer any questions you may have. The adoption policies and applications can be found at the following links: www.tinyurl.com/fcrtcats / www.tinyurl.com/fcrtdogs. Email us at adoption@fancycats.org for general questions about our rescued cats. Email us at dogadoptions@fancycats.org for general questions about our rescued dogs.\nYou can save animals like this one by becoming a foster! Fosters are like bridges between high kill shelters and forever homes. We need fosters so that we can save cats and dogs before they are euthanized at the shelters.

Please read our Frequently Asked Questions and Adoption Processed Explained documentation.\n_________ B I O ______________\n\nName:Jonesy\nSize: (Once fully grown) ~Large range: 61-100 lbs\nAdoption Donation:$250 (applicable sales tax included) PLUS a $100 deposit is required and is to be refunded once proof of spay/neuter is provided to this rescue. Our adoption contract requires all dogs to be spayed/neutered within ONE Month of adoption or when age-appropriate.Adoption fees may be paid by cash or check.\nOther:Intact Male, Vaccinations current, Microchip, Not apartment-friendly\n\nPuppies generally need the following veterinary care after their adoption:\n\n8 Weeks:Distemper/Parvo & Bordetella Vaccinations. Luv of Dog Rescue completes these vaccinations before adoption.\n12 Weeks:Distemper/Parvo Vaccination, completed at the veterinarian of adopter's choice.\n16 Weeks:Distemper/Parvo Vaccination, Rabies Vaccination, completed at the veterinarian of adopter's choice.\n6 Months:Spay/Neuter surgery. \nYearly thereafter:All dogs need yearly wellness exams performed by a veterinarian as well as booster vaccinations.\n\n~Spay/Neuter surgeries cost between $150-$250 for a neuter and $300-$400 for a spay surgery in the FM Area.Wellness visits can run from $50 to $100 for each visit. If you are thinking of adopting a puppy, it's a good idea to research these costs before adopting by calling the veterinarian of your choice.\n\nJonesy would love to grow up to be a well-trained and loved boy!\n\nFoster Home Feedback\n\n1/31/21: Jonesy has been a pleasure to have in our home for the past couple of weeks. He has lots of puppy energy so a playmate to help him burn off the energy would be best. He is a loud barker and barks a lot while playing so an apartment would probably not be the best place for him. Jonesy also knows how to just relax and hang out as well, which is nice.\n\nJonesy is working on potty training and has gone a couple of weeks without pooping in the house! He does still struggle with peeing outside but if you watch him and he looks like he is going to pee, we ask if he needs to go potty and he will wait to go until he is outside.\n\nJonesy loves to chew and sometimes needs reminders to only chew on toys and bones. He doesn't typically nap much in the morning but will nap quite a bit in the afternoon. Jonesy likes to fight sleep and will get kind of naughty if he is too tired. He does best if someone sits with him and helps him settle down so he can sleep.\n\nJonesy prefers to be close to his people so he sleeps in his kennel right by the bed. He sleeps mostly through the night but sometimes wakes up but he will go back to sleep after a few minutes.To view additional dogs available for adoption, please see our website: www.4luvofdog.org",

I came to OPH and my foster home after a REALLY long ride and I am ready to find my best forever home!\n\nI am currently living with my foster family, learning all kinds of fun things but it's time. Time for me to find my forever family. \nMy foster mom says I am the largest of the boys at 6.4 pounds, and also the leader of the pack. I like to play with sticks and chew toys but don't worry, I love to be held and loved on too. I am just a baby at 9 weeks old so I am going to need your help to learn all those good doggie things like going potty outside, walking on a leash, not chewing things that are not mine and lots more. Are you up for the challenge to teach me? I promise, I'll be your best friend forever. Don't wait too long, I'll be here will you fill out the adoption application.\n\nI am just a baby and my adopters should be respectful of my small size and puppy needs, such as not being left alone for more than 4 hours at a time, and to teach me proper manners with play, potty, leash walking and crating. In return, I promise to try really hard to make you proud and to give lots of puppy kisses!\n\nPlease note that because this puppy is so young, it has only received 2 of the required 3 puppy distemper vaccinations. This is very IMPORTANT because it means that the immune system will not be fully functioning until about 16 weeks of age. Until then, the puppy MUST stay out of public places where it could be exposed to the germs of other dogs. These no puppy zones include all pet stores, dog parks, and for apartment dwellers, areas used by other dogs. These requirements are strictly for the puppys medical safety and longevity.\n\nThis puppy is microchipped and up to date on age appropriate vaccines and monthly preventatives.\nTo adopt this dog, or any OPH dog, fill out the simple online application at https://ophrescue.org \nOperation Paws for Homes, Inc. (OPH) rescues dogs of all breeds and ages from high-kill shelters in NC, VA, MD, and SC, reducing the numbers being euthanized. With limited resources, the shelters are forced to put down 50-90% of the animals that come in the front door. OPH provides pet adoption services to families located in VA, DC, MD, PA and neighboring states. OPH is a 501(c)(3) organization and is 100% donor funded. OPH does not operate a shelter or have a physical location. We rely on foster families who open their homes to give love and attention to each dog before finding a forever home.",

Her and her sister were rescued from the streets in the fall and have been enjoying the foster life since. Honey couldn't keep up with her sister's bold play, so they found separate foster homes. This sweetheart had a canine foster brother and made great progress learning housebreaking. She was even a popular playmate and cuddle buddy to the local kids! After this big move to another country and climate, she's become a little timid. She bonds strongly to her people and would love an adventurous family!\n\nKey Notes:\n-7 month old spayed female.\n-Sight hound mix.\n-30 pounds and still has some growing to do.\n-Found as a stray by a rescue in Qatar.\n-No small homes; needs room to run and play.\n-Good with dog-savvy kids.\n-Loves to play with other dogs!\n-No more than 5 hours alone a day; can go longer as she gets older.\n-Medium-high energy; loves lots of silly puppy playtime!\n-Mostly housebroken; just needs a bit more help.\n-Shy after big move to shelter.\n-Experience with dogs recommended.\n-Basic obedience training recommended.\n\n--THE ADOPTION PROCESS--\nIf you are interested in adopting this animal, please submit an online application.

She has great leash walking skills, is kennel trained, and muzzle trained.  Gabbi is tolerant of other dogs out side of the home but due to her possible past traumas we feel she would do best being the only dog in the home.  \n\nWhen Gabbi came into our care she was suffering from allergies, since switching to a fish based diet her skin has improved tremendously.  Ideally , raw may be a good option for Gabbi in the future.  \n\nGabbi is best suited from a home that has no cats.  She has not been tested with small children but due to her playful energy and lack of personal space, Gabbi would be best suited for a home with kids 10 and up.  Gabbi loves the great outdoors so a home with a wood fenced yard is best suited for her. Breed experience is preferred.\n\nIf you are interested in Gabbi and feel she would be the perfect addition to your home please apply at; \nhttps://icefoundationk9rescue.ca/how-to-help/adopt/\n\nAt this time no all applications can be answered.

She has many loves; car rides, swimming, and fetch to name a few. Her previous family helped her learn how to be a properly loved companion; she's housebroken, happy to greet everyone, and learned a lot of tricks! When the stress and chaos of moving out of state caused her to begin acting up with the child in the home the hard decision was made to have Kopi find a new home. While it was devastating, Kopi has stayed optimistic! Her days are full of running with the other pups, going on walks with the humans, and snuggling into her bed with plenty of toys. She's eager to find her new adult-only family to spoil her with even more play and cuddles. She would make an amazing hiking partner and thrive in more advanced training like agility!\n\nKey Notes:\n-2-year old spayed female.\n-Labrador retriever mix.\n-Around 70 pounds and a healthy weight.\n-Brought to Buddy Dog when the stress of moving caused her to start pushing around the child in her home.\n-No apartment style homes or small homes. A fenced-in yard is ideal.\n-Needs and adult only (18+) home. Visiting children okay with supervision.\n-Plays great with other dogs closer to her size!\n-No more than 6 hours alone a day; will need a potty and play break for longer.\n-Medium energy; loves playtime followed by relaxing by the TV with her family.\n-Housebroken and crate trained.\n-Learning proper leash walking but still pulls a bit.\n-Food motivated; knows many tricks!\n-Loves car rides, walks, swimming, and fetch.\n-Would thrive in advanced training for fun!\n\n--THE ADOPTION PROCESS--\nIf you are interested in adopting this animal, please submit an online application. Applications will be reviewed as received. If in our opinion a pet is a good candidate for you, an adoption\u00a0counselor will contact you to schedule a zoom chat. If you do not hear from us it simply means either the animal has been adopted or we have not received the right pet for you. The application process is at no charge to you and only needs to be completed once as all applications will be kept on file.\n\nOnline applications can be found here: www.buddydoghs.com/forms\n\nCheck out our FAQ for answers to most questions here: www.buddydoghs.com/faq\n\nAdopters must be at least 21 years of age and a Massachusetts resident.",

            "description": "Hi there! My names Hoku. I'm a sweet energetic puppy looking for a home who will dedicate their time to training and exercise. Because of my excitement, some people might not like me jumping on them!! Which I get, but I do need help with training on that since I am so used to doing it. I love meeting new people; I will just soak in all the attention you give me. So, I LOVE toys!! So much. Squeaky toys, tennis balls, ropes... strings!! You name it. I love to share too because it means you'll play with me. Although, I do play tug and my handler says that's a no-no! Can you teach me why? Speaking of things I love... I love food and rawhide. I don't mind sharing those either. I'm a smart girl too, I know sit! I would love to learn more things since I am highly treat and toy motivated. Although, no tiny fingers because I take them a little roughly. When I meet another dog, I get so excited!! I run and pull and jump towards the other dogs! Some of them may not like it, which I understand but cannot comprehend! I think I just need further socialization with other dogs. Overall, I think I would do best in a home with no small children, probably no one under the age of 13 due to my jumpiness and high arousal levels. I also need a home dedicated to training and exercise. I hope to meet you soon!!",

Love to go for long walks on the beach or hiking mountains? I'm the pup for you! Ok, so we don't have many beaches or any mountains nearby, but the point is I want to be with you every step of the way! I'll need a family that will give me plenty of exercise, play time, training, and socialization. I will need to meet any resident children and/or dogs before going to my forever home. Harley will be shown by appointment only. If you are interested in learning more about this animal, please fill out an application by clicking here .

He is 4 years old, neutered, and in good health with all vaccines up to date. We are looking for a forever home for Frank that can give him the love, attention, and action he needs and deserves. Frank is an extremely smart, loyal, and loving boy who loves nothing more than a game of fetch. Ok, maybe he loves getting a treat as much as a game of fetch. Frank has passed basic obedience training with flying colors since he was a pup. He is great off-leash and will 'sit', 'stay', 'down', 'leave it', and 'come' with near-perfection, and has the capability to learn far more skills if put in the time and effort. Frank loves being outside and loves any activity, including hiking, swimming, playing in the snow, fetch, 'search & rescue' with his ball, etc. Frank is quite independent and prefers the company of humans over other dogs. He has also shown fear towards children. Frank would do best in a home with acreage, without small children (ages 12 and under) and where he was the only dog, however if there was another adult dog with similar independent demeanor it may still be a good fit. Frank doesn't have much experience with cats or livestock but could be open to a meeting. Please, no condo or apartment living. Frank currently lives in Bend, Oregon.\nPlease contact via email with any questions or interest at alexjanadoza@gmail.com\n\nTHIS IS A COURTESY LISTING. HUNAH IS NOT PLACING THIS DOG. PLEASE CONTACT THE OWNER DIRECTLY.\n\n\n\n",

            "description": "If you're looking for a playful, affectionate, silly, happy, big kid of a dog - O'Henry could be the right match for you. He's a handsome guy with a lot of envious skills, he is house trained, crate trained, doesn't pull on the leash, he's treat motivated and comes when called. He's a really good boy with overall good manners.\n\nO'Henry has a lot of energy, and would be best suited to an owner who would enjoy having an active dog around to take on big walks and hikes. He walks nicely on the leash, but he does have a strong prey drive...so stay alert to make sure you see those squirrels before he does!\n\nO'Henry is at his absolute happiest when he is playing with his toys, or running around being goofy with other doggy pals.\n\nThere's a few puppy-like habits that he still needs to be trained out of...let's just say there has been the odd thing in his foster home that has a few O'Henry teeth marks on it, and he needs to learn that they're not his chew toys! He's an intelligent boy, and he loves to please his humans, so we think with training this will improve.\n\nO'Henry is 2 years old, 58 lbs, and ready for his forever home! Please visit www.liveloveanimalrescue.org to fill out an adoption application.",

Obviously ok with kids but as you see the youngest ducking, she can give a little to much love for small ones. They should be dog ready lol\nShe is food motivated and fine when reminded. Example easy when treating if you want to keep your finger tips lol and leash work. She pulls but when you say wait and slow she quickly responds.\nShe is ok with dogs after proper introduction. No cats. She chases, does correct but why risk injury.\nCrates well and is housebroken.",

She is just under 3 years old, has a pretty red tri coat, and is overweight at 30 pounds.  We have just started our evaluation of Tillie who came from a difficult situation.  While she loves women she is fearful of men, and it will take us some extra time to learn how we can best help her feel safe with all people.  We also know that Tillie loves other dogs, loves the snow, and she is housebroken and crate-trained!  We hope that Tillie\u2019s evaluation will be complete in anther week or so and we hope you will check back then.  Tillie is fostered in Portsmouth, VA.",

            "description": "Hello,\n\nMy name is Ranger. I am a 75 lb adult (4-7 yr old) German Shepard mix. I think I am closer to the younger side in that age range.\n\nWhen I first came to K9, I was extremely underweight and heartworm positive. For me, it would best if any children in the home were over 13 years of age. I have been treated for heartworm and am feeling much better now. Slowly but surely I am getting closer to the weight I should be. I will sit patiently and wait for my food and accept treats gently when offered. I will also take my pills easily with a hotdog or peanut butter. I will eat all my dry dog food whenever my bowl is filled. If my foster family gives me any table food like scrambled eggs or meat scraps, I like to carry my bowl into the area they are eating to eat my special food with them. They think it\u2019s the funniest thing in the world.\n\nI am a big teddy bear and crave closeness from my family. I like to do what they are doing. Sitting on the couch and getting booty and belly rubs is amazing.\n\nIn my foster home, there is only a bird. I leave the bird alone. I seem to be interested in other dogs. Another dog in the home could be great for me. If you have another dog in your home let\u2019s do a meet and greet and see how we do together.\n\nI like all toys but I am especially fond of rope toys. I will spend a lot of time taking apart the rope. Tennis balls are another good toy for me. I\u2019m getting pretty good at dropping them when you ask me to.\n\nI have done well with potty training overall. A few accidents in the beginning til I learned where I was suppose to go potty. Be patient and diligent with me up front and I\u2019ll pick up on potty training in your home in no time.\n\nI have only gone on a few car rides so far but they were fun for me. I just sat in the back seat and looked out the window. Occasionally, I also would lay down too.\n\nI really enjoy meeting new people and getting extra attention. I mean who doesn\u2019t? I\u2019m an attention-hog so I have discovered if I greet everyone with a smile on my face I get more pets.\n\nI come pretty well when my foster family calls my name. It doesn\u2019t take much for me come back by their side. Even when I am outside exploring the fenced yard, they call and I come running to see them.\n\nI have free range of the house for bed time but I seem to like to sleep on the floor behind the couch. I am not that interested in sleeping on my doggie bed or in my foster families\u2019 bedrooms. I may start in there but I tend to leave after a little while.\n\nLeash walking is going great! I just love walks! I get pretty excited when I realize I'm going on a walk but I sit patiently while my foster family puts my harness on me. Now that I'm feeling better, I am pulling on the leash a little bit at first but I settle down pretty quickly.  I also like to bark a little bit at first to see if any of my neighbor dog friends are around to talk to.\n\nI am having the best time eating the snow. I also like jumping and playing with the snow. I\u2019m well-mannered and respectful of the boundaries I have been taught. I have not jumped on the counter or chewed on things that were not my dog toys. I think that is pretty good if you ask me. I love to be near my foster family, while they work at home or when we go play in yard. It\u2019s all great! I would enjoy a fenced yard if you have one. Now I just need to find the forever home of my dreams.\n \nIf you think we could be a good match and you are over 21 years old, send in an application for me at k9stray.com. My friends at K9 will be in touch.\n\nI can\u2019t wait to meet you!\n\n~Ranger\n \n",

I am a young girl, maybe 1 to 2 years old. I had a litter of puppies and after all my puppies found homes a nice lady took me and gave me to Furr Ever Pets Rescue. \n\nI love to play with my person and have them near by me. I usually go to the door and ask out when I need to go potty. I would love having a yard to be able to play in and a warm house to spend time with my person. I am a bit shy until I get to know you. Can you please give me a warm home with love like my foster mom is right now?\n\nText or call and leave a message if you are interested in adopting me.  Ione Fried at 903-918-3213.\n\nThis dog can be seen at our adoption events on the 2nd and 4th Saturday of the month at Jake's Feed in Longview, TX or by appointment to approved applicants.

That feature is a default with petfinder, and is not a part of our adoption process.\n\nThe first step in our adoption process is the application.  Completed applications take priority over inquiries.  To apply to adopt, please copy and paste the following url:\n\nhttps://fs30.formsite.com/legacygsd/form4/index.html\n\nIntroducing Jack!  Jack is a (purebred) Anatolian Shepherd. His birthday is 8/15/19. He is 98lbs.\n\nJack was an owner surrender. His family lived out in the country. They didn't have a fence and Jack was left to roam. The neighbor did not appreciate Jack wandering onto his property and threatened to shoot him. The family tried Jack on a chain but a hearding breed does not do well with that type of setup.  Jack became depressed.  They decided that it was in Jack's best interest to surrender him to rescue to find a more suitable home with a fenced yard where Jack can enjoy the outdoors safely. \n\nJack is a gentle giant. He is such a sweet boy!  He is well mannered.  He loves the outdoors but is also learning that being inside a home is also pretty awesome!  Jack is very laid back but also likes to get out there and romp and play when appropriate. He's BFF is Copper and the love playing and being goofy together. Jack has been around dogs 60lbs and up.  We can cat test him upon request. Jack has been around children 12 and up.\n\nJack is up to date on vaccines, has been tested for heartworms and 5 diseases spread by ticks, was tested/treated for ehrlichia, had entropian in both eyes but he's had the surgery to repair them, is neutered and microchipped. Jack is on monthly heartworm and flea/tick prevention.\n\nAs with all of our dogs, we recommend a basic obedience class to help him understand what is expected of him, and this also helps with the bonding process. \n\nJack\u2019s adoption fee is $475, which covers all his vetting, preventatives, fostering costs and other associated expenses.  We do not adopt to anyone under the age of 21.\n\n",

            "description": "Single Blue Female ISO of that special somebody or bodies with a cozy home so we can build our perfect, forever life together. I prefer gentle people with patience that won't give up on me if I make a mistake. I will try my hardest to do my best and make you happy. You see, I used to live out in the woods, alone for years. Around 3 lonely years if I had to guess. People tried to get me but at that time I did not know I wanted to be gotten. I have spent some time learning all things dog, but I can be a touch shy and new things can make me nervous at first. I love cuddles, food, stuffy toys with a squeaker and naps in any order or combination. I do the 'kangaroo Dance' when it's time to eat and make a noise like a hungry alien when I know someone else is eating and leaving me out of the equation. I DON'T like being out in the rain, vacuum cleaners and brooms. Cars are ok, they still freak me out a little. Walks were tough to learn, you know that whole leash thing felt weird and then we go places that are new and you know what I said about that new stuff. I am doing really well with it though. I like walking with other dogs, but I can do it by myself now too. I don't pull or act all crazy when I see another dog like some of my weird foster siblings. I keep asking them what all the fuss is about? I can walk with tons of dogs but prefer my home crew to be smaller and quieter. I can be friends with boy dogs or girl dogs as long as they're not too silly, bouncy and loud. I am quiet in my crate, well usually quiet in general but will give a good bark if I feel like something fishy is going on outside or in another room. I'm a pretty cool girl that needs someone who will understand that moving may be hard on me at first, that I need a little structure and that I am continuing to learn what it means to be comfortable with all the things the world has to offer. I am about 6 years old but really I am not sure because I didn't get a birthday party until I was rescued. Are you the special somebody I have been searching for? We can celebrate our birthdays together if you like? Please let the humans know if you have any other questions. ---Love Matilda\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Matilda, please fill out an application today!",

That feature is a default with petfinder, and is not a part of our adoption process.\n\nThe first step in our adoption process is the application.  Completed applications take priority over inquiries.  To apply to adopt, please copy and paste the following url:\n\nhttps://fs30.formsite.com/legacygsd/form4/index.html\n\nIntroducing Tally!  Tally is a 15 week old Plott Hound/Mix.  She is currently 14lbs and will be a medium size dog full grown.\n\nTally came to rescue from a shelter in rural MS.  She was originally picked up as a stray and no one claimed her.  After a 72 hr \"stray hold\" the shelter can and will euthanize dogs and puppies. We couldn't let that be this cutie patootie's fate so we sent a volunteer to scoop her up on her \"due out\" day.\n\nTally is a sweet girl. She is a little shy when meeting new people but warms quickly. She is doing great in her foster home.  Tally has become a snuggle bug and loves getting TLC from her foster mom.  She has learned that beds and blankets are fantastic!  She is learning her house manners and doing well with her house training.  She is good with other dogs and get along with all the other canines in her foster home.  She is curious about cats but she got popped on the nose by the cat at the vet clinic we use she decided that maybe cats aren't that friendly.  She has been around children school age and up.  \n\nTally is up to date on age appropriate vaccines, tested for intestinal parasites and treated accordingly, is on monthly heartworm and flea/tick prevention, is spayed and microchipped.\n\nAs with all of our dogs, we recommend a basic obedience class to help her understand what is expected of her, and this also helps with the bonding process. \n\nTally's adoption fee is $475, which covers all her vetting, preventatives, fostering costs and other associated expenses.  We do not adopt to anyone under the age of 21.\n\n",

He is a very sweet boy who has spent the majority of his life not being socialized or had much training so we are working on those things with him before he is able to be adopted. What we do know is although he is shy, he LOVES his people including kids! He would do best in a calmer household, with a family that has plenty of time for him. We are working very hard on both house and crate training, but we aren't fully there yet. He does okay with other dogs his size, but doesn't like bigger dogs or high energy dogs in his face.\n\nIf interested please visit our website to view the process and fill out an application.
