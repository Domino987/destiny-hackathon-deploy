            "description": "Hi, I am Meatball. I am a young adult male dachshund mix. I am current on my vaccinations and I am neutered and heartworm negative.\n\nI can be a little shy when first meeting, but when I get to know you, I will just follow you anywhere you want to go. I love all people; however, I think if there are kids involved, I would prefer older kids and not toddlers. What makes me happy? Well, you of course, but also snuggles and tummy rubs and running after squirrels in the yard. I also love pleasing people and hearing them tell me \"Good Boy!\". I get along with other dogs too, so I would not mind having another dog to share my home with. My foster mom says I could try losing a couple pounds, so I would really like a fenced in yard where I can run after squirrels, play with other pups, or just explore.\n\nI know, I know... \"You sound perfect and are so cute. Why don't you have a home yet?\" Well, I did, but I started having seizures and it wasn't something they felt comfortable with, so I came back to AHF. I have seen doctors and I am currently on Levetiracetam for the seizures. I take one pill every 8 hours. This is something I may need forever. At some point things can change and the doctor may stop or change the meds, but that is what I am taking for now. It really is not that big of a deal. I do not have seizures constantly, and I can play and cuddle and do everything any other dog can do.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting, I would love that. I do not feel you will regret it if you give me a chance to live a long and happy live with you. Fill out an application if interested in me. My foster mom can also answer any questions you may have about the seizures.\n\nHope to see you soon!\n\n\nEmail: dogs@almosthomefoundation.org\n\nAlmost Home Foundation's adoption requirements:\n(1) Be at least 21 years of age;\n(2) Have the consent of all adults living in the household;\n(3) Have approval from the residence owner;\n(4) Have valid ID with current address;\n(5) Be approved by Almost Home Foundation as a suitable adoptive home; and\n(6) Live in the Greater Chicago Land area. Illinois only\n*** Please note that Almost Home Foundation accepts only cash or checks for adoption fees; we do not accept debit or credit cards. ***",

I\u2019m a four-year-old, six-pound male chihuahua, fully vetted and vaccinated, neutered, microchipped, and up-to-date on heartworm medications. If you\u2019re in need of a miniature apprentice, I\u2019m ready to fill the role!\n\nThe snuggles are strong with this one! Maybe I\u2019m in touch with some magical snuggling Force. Maybe it\u2019s just my soft, sleek black fur. Either way, you won\u2019t find a sweeter companion when it\u2019s time to get cozy in front of the TV! I give great kisses too! I get along well with other dogs, so I\u2019ll fit right in with any troop.\n\nUnfortunately, I\u2019ve had some experiences with the dark side, so I\u2019m a bit slow to trust. I keep my guard up, but you\u2019ll be able to win me over with patience and love. \n\nJudge me by my size, do you? I may be tiny, but I\u2019ve got a big heart! I\u2019ve had a rough start in life, but with the right family, I know I can be a real hero! I\u2019m looking for a new hope...can you help me find it?\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Jedi, please DO NOT SEND A MESSAGE TO OUR RESCUE GROUP.  We are too busy placing dogs in great homes to answer messages and inquiries through the listing site.  \n\nPLEASE GO TO THE LINK BELOW TO COMPLETE AN ADOPTION APPLICATION.\n \nwww.chihuahua-rescue.com/adoption-application\n \nCRT requires an approved adoption application and a home visit for all adoption applicants.  CRT transports to OH, KY, IL, MI, MN, WI. \n\n",

He was extremely matted so we had to shave his hair down but he seems to like a short haircut. He is good with other dogs, mostly housebroken and paper trained, but not completely. He has very few teeth left but he still has a great appetite. Other than a perineal hernia which we had surgically repaired, and some teary eyes he is in good health for his age. He is about 7 lbs. \n\nTo adopt this little man, you must meet the following requirements\n- at least one other small friendly dog in the household\n- preferably a home or condo with a yard or small patio for potty area \n- preferably an owner that is home a lot to give him lots of attention\n- an owner that will keep up with his grooming\n\nTo apply, please contact us at jjwoofinpaws@gmail.com",

We were named as the Hollywood litter, because what little girl doesn't need a little glamour in their life? Am I right? I have had some false starts in my \"happily ever after\" but SOCA and my foster family have taken a lot of extra steps to help me. My nervous energy has turned out to be based on confusion, and a lack of confidence. I spent an entire month in very extensive training, and my foster mom has learned what I need as well. I need an adopter that will take what I have learned and continue to work with me down the path I am on. I responded very well to training and new techniques. I currently live with my foster mom, her 10 year old daughter, and other doggies! I love people once I get to know them, and other dogs. I need slow introductions with new people, and a little help when I get too excited.\n\nI am house broken and will communicate when I need to go outside. I can sit, lay down, and love treats! I enjoy jogging with my foster mom because I am really quite the athlete, and have no trouble keeping up. Everyone that meets me loves me, even my new trainer said I was one of his favorites and we really became great friends. I need the right fit and when I find it, I will be your best friend for life. I am very loyal.\n\nMy adoption fee is $200 and will include spay, vaccinations and microchip. You can apply to adopt me at www.soca-fbc.org, Adopt A Dog.",

Cloud was exploring and wondered on to the property of an older couple who could not keep him and called for rescue. Cloud is looking for someone who will keep him active and healthy. He walks well on a leash but would love a fenced in backyard to run in. He is good with other dogs and ok with cats (will chase but wont hurt them). He loves to chew on bones, chase balls plus cuddle and gives the best hugs. This loving guy needs a home that understand he needs to explore. Cloud is medium energy who would make a great camping / hiking partner. He is always ready for the next adventure. Are you ready for a forever adventure with him?\n\nIf you are interested, complete the\nAdoption Application\non our website at\nwww.NeedyPaws.org\nand we will contact you.\n\nAdopters must live within an hour's drive of St. Louis, MO.\n\nCloud's adoption fee is $250.00, which includes up-to-date vaccinations, heartworm testing and preventative, spay/neuter and microchip.\n\nWe are a 100% foster-based rescue and all of our dogs live in approved foster homes. We are dedicated to finding the best Forever Homes, and will perform home visits and conduct veterinarian and reference checks for each potential adopter.",

He's very energetic and active, which is not a good match for his temporary caretaker, but is a very sweet pup with a good temperament. Being so young, he could use a little training but no bad habits have been observed - no aggressive behavior towards people or other dogs (Max has not been around cats).  He is also good with children.\n\n\"Mr Wiggles\" would love to have a forever home with a an owner who can handle his youth and strength. If you might be interested and would like more information please call Sherri Graham at 530 474-3746 (no early morning or late night calls, please). We're betting that Max will be a great companion in his future family!",

I weigh roughly 56 lbs.\n\nEven though I didn't have the best 8 years so far, I am a very happy, well adjusted girl. I really enjoy people of all sizes and I am great with my fellow canines. I don't bark a lot at all, and I am super chill. \nMy legs look a little different, but I was born this way. It doesn't stop me from getting around and enjoying life!\nIf you want an easy keeper or a great first dog, I am your girl!\n\nWith my adorable looks, and unbridled loyalty, I will always be there for you through thick and thin. I will never judge you, or turn my back on you. Every single day, you will look at me and you will know that you are loved unconditionally. I will never betray you or hurt you, and I will grow old by your side.\n\n******IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ ALL THE GREAT INFO BELOW******\n\n***Please don't apply unless you are very serious about adopting, and are ready to move forward with the adoption process. We are super busy and make a great effort to respond back to EVERYONE ASAP! WHEN WE TAKE THE TIME TO PROCESS AN APPLICATION AND RESPOND BACK TO THE APPLICANT JUST TO BE EITHER IGNORED OR BE TOLD THEY CANNOT COME FOR SEVERAL DAYS, MORE TIME IS WASTED~PLEASE HAVE MORE RESPECT THAN THAT!\n\nPLEASE read our website's ADOPTION PROCESS PAGE prior to submitting an adoption application. www.apupspizzazzrescue.com/adoption-process \nADOPTION APPLICATION: www.apupspizzazzrescue.com/adoption-application \n\nABOUT OUR RESCUE DOGS: \n All of our dogs are located in Connecticut, are spayed or neutered, up to date on vaccines, microchipped, have been given deworming medications, and have had CT State health checks, & go home with a leash, collar, & packet of medical paperwork. \n\nBREED IDENTIFICATION:\nPlease understand that many rescue dogs are mixes of multiple breeds. Petfinder allows us to choose up to two breeds per dog. While the shelters and our rescue do our best in accurately identifying breeds, breed identification is not guaranteed. If there is a certain breed that you do not want, it is very important that you share this with our rescue when applying. When adopting a puppy, breed uncertainty plays a big part in the size/look of the dog as an adult. Please know that any puppy can be a wonderful dog, regardless of preconceived notions of certain breeds, but it is very important that the adopter has the dedication and patience to raise the puppy with boundaries, consistency, structure, & love. The more effort you give towards training & time you allow for exercise, your puppy will grow to be a HUGE source of UNCONDITIONAL LOVE, TOTAL LOYALTY, HAPPINESS, COMFORT & COMPANIONSHIP!\n\nABOUT OUR RESCUE:\nWe are a small rescue run by volunteers & focused on finding the right match for both our dogs & for you. If you are interested in adopting through our rescue, you first will need to complete an adoption application & be approved as a potential adopter before meeting any of our pups. No need to be intimidated by our application as it allows us to get to know you & your lifestyle. Of course, the more you can share the better! Please also note, while a fenced yard is fantastic, it is not required by our rescue, however, it may be required for a certain dog occasionally.  Once adoption applicants are approved to become potential adopters, we offer private appointments where you can meet one or several dogs at the discretion of the rescue. We offer a unique & pleasant experience focused on finding the perfect match. It is extremely important to us that everyone is treated with respect & that NO ONE IS LEFT HANGING. WE WILL GET BACK TO YOU WITHIN 2 TO 3 DAYS of application submission. If there is a dog you are eager to meet, please  TEXT US DIRECTLY at 203-241-2351 so that we can check the status of your application and move it forward immediately. We look forward to hearing from you and helping you find your new best friend.\n\n*All adult dogs can be cat tested by request.\n\nHOME/RENTER INSURANCE:\nSOME PROVIDERS HAVE VERY STRICT POLICIES REGARDING WHICH TYPE OF DOG BREEDS ARE ALLOWED UNDER THEIR COVERAGE. STATE FARM WAS SUGGESTED TO US AS THEY DO NOT PUNISH, DROP, NOR REFUSE YOU DUE TO DOG BREED SHOULD YOU RUN INTO ISSUES WITH YOUR CURRENT PROVIDER.",

If you want a pair of girls that love each other, love people, AND love life, then look no farther than three-year-old DARLA and FLO. \n\nDARLA (in pink) is a pretty quiet girl, but will follow FLO's (in red) lead. That means when FLO wants to play, DARLA will engage in the fun. FLO is a spunky girl that is treat motivated.\n\nBest guess for Darla\u2019s breed would be Miniature Sheltie mix. \n\nBoth girls are Heartworm Positive, but The A.R.K covers heartworm treatment. If you have questions about DARLA and FLO or questions about heartworm treatment, then contact The A.R.K. \n309-246-4275\n\nAdoption Application: https://thearkanimalshelter.org/adoption-application/\n\nDownload and complete the application.

She was skin and bones when found and had patches of hair missing. Poor little thing. She had an amazing family looking after her before she was brought to the rescue. We have put some weight on her and had a blood panel done. The blood panel had a few off values but we attributed that to her starving. We will have another done once we feel she is at the right weight. We are hoping her fur comes back in.\nHolly seems to get along well with other dogs. She REALLY loves humans and has a puppy love attitude. She really likes to be with her person. We will update more as we learn more about her.",

Unfortunately her owners' landlord will not allow them to keep her, so she's looking for a new forever home to share all the love she has to give. Nova has lots of energy and loves to play, especially with squeaky toys and tennis balls. She is a very loyal dog and eager to please! Nova can resource-guard with food, but has no outward aggression over treats or toys. She is very well tempered and super affectionate, licking you to show her love.\nPlease contact Michelle at dogzinneed@yahoo.com or 760.390.8973 to meet Nova! She doesn't have much time before being sent into boarding.",

            "description": "**Update**  (1/18/21)  Mickey was moved from his temp foster home to a foster home where he can stay until we approve an adopter.   It appears that Mickey's eyesight is very compromised, not sure if he can see light and shadows or not. \n (1/16/21)  This little man has quite a story to tell!   He was found after a snowstorm by a policeman who heard him crying in the woods.   Based on evidence of foot prints, the officer thinks that little Mickey was dumped in the woods and left to fend for himself.   He said that Mickey had been out there on his own for at least 3 days, and it appeared by the evidence in the snow that Mickey had never left the spot where he was dumped.   Somehow Mickey lived through this ordeal and did not have frostbite, most likely because his paws were packed with dirt and poop.   Mickey made his way to a rescue friend who asked us to bring him into our rescue.   We are not sure yet of his age, but he will be seeing our vet and receiving vax next week.   Mickey is friendly with the other dogs that he has met.   At first he didn't seem to understand being petted and held, but he has warmed up and is doing well.  WOULD YOU LIKE TO MEET LITTLE MICKEY?    We are looking for a foster home in the Leb/Lanc/Hbg area or an adopter in Central PA.   PLEASE EMAIL US AT AngelsAmongUsRS@live.com FOR AN APPLICATION.",

I am an inquisitive little guy, (only 9 lbs), probably a Jack Russell and dachshund mix, who found myself all alone and confused until a good samaritan found me and searched for my owner. When no one claimed me, hard to believe, I joined a great rescue group who got me a clean bill of health with their vet, gave me my vaccinations, the big neuter snip snip and a microchip. I am ready to find my forever home! Per my name, I have the coolest coloring with lots of great black 'patches' on my white coat.\n\nI am a young dude, with a medium level of energy who will do well in a home with my own yard to run in and sniff when I do my business. Outdoor supervision is a must! Another small playmate might be fun, too. I haven't met cats yet so an intro would be required. Little kiddos scare me, so my foster mom says kids over 10 only. Your patience and understanding and lots of tender loving care will help me adjust to my new home. I don't ever want to be alone again! Adoption means you are committed to me forever and I will be committed to you too! My foster family will update my bio as they learn more about me so that I am matched with the perfect forever home! I am a snuggler, love to sleep on foster mom's bed, and also walk well on a leash! Are you my forever home?\n\nIf interested in learning more about PATCHES, please complete our online application at www.helpadogsmile.org. As the rescue does home visits and stays in close contact with the adopter during the adoption process, only Phoenix area homes will be considered for PATCHES. His adoption fee of $350 helps with medical expenses of the rescue.",

As with all puppies he will need a family that is going to be patient while he is going through potty training and will need to be on a regular potty schedule. He is a hound dog and his nose is to the ground sniffing everything he can. When he gets focused on something he goes full speed ahead.\n\nPlease do some research on the breed as they are hounds and have hound traits, they can be high energy dogs that when full grown will need lots of stimulation and exercise, they do not make good apartment dogs as hounds are very vocal, a 6ft securely fenced in yard is a must as with any hound their nose is to the ground and they will follow what they smell and love to run.\n\nThey are said to be good family dogs who will be fine with dog courteous children. They are loyal and loving and want to be with their humans all the time.\n\nHighly recommended is getting him into puppy training as soon as possible.\n\nIf interested, please complete the Adoption Application on our website at www.NeedyPaws.org and we will contact you. Adopters must live within an hour's drive of St. Louis, MO.\n\nOur $250 adoption fee includes up-to-date vaccinations, heartworm testing and preventative, spay/neuter and microchip.\n\nWe are a 100% foster-based rescue and all of our dogs live in approved foster homes. We are dedicated to finding the best Forever Homes, and will perform home visits and conduct veterinarian and reference checks for each potential adopter.",

            "description": "Adoption fee on this dog is $300.\n\nSammie Jo is a beautiful red and tan female that is approximately 6 years old.  She originally came to us with her litter of puppies in 2018 from a local shelter.  She was adopted out and returned to us in 2019, through no fault of her own.  She unfortunately came back to us overweight at 107 lbs on a 70 lb. frame. \n \nShe suffered a torn cruciate in her right rear knee, due in part to her being overweight.  She has slimmed down to her ideal weight around 70 lbs. She had surgery at UC Davis in August of 2020 to repair her knee.  She is fully recovered from her surgery and now ready to go into a home again where she can enjoy life and have a family of her own. \n  \nSammie Jo is super sweet and loves attention.  She does have some ball drive.  She will bring you her ball or toy and wait patiently for you to throw it.  She also has a medium prey drive, so a home with small dogs or cats would not work for this girl. \n  \nSammie Jo knows basic commands and has great recall.  She is a good alarm barker, keeping an eye on things in the home.  She currently lives in a home with 3 adult male GSDs and 1 adult female GSD.  She gets along well with everyone.  She also behaves like a typical mature female, and becomes the fun police if things get too rowdy for her taste.  \n \nSammie Jo needs to work on her leash manners.  She is very strong and has a tremendous amount of pull.   The ideal adopter will need a good center of gravity, in order not to be pulled down. \n \nSammie Jo needs a home where her food intake will be monitored, and food securely stored.  She needs a home where the owner will appreciate her crafty nature and her problem-solving skills.   She will benefit from being in a home that will provide her with daily exercised and continued training.   \n\nThis dog is a Level 2. Please be sure you understand what a dog of this Level requires. Go to our home page for an explanation of the Dog Rating Levels.\n\nFor more information and to see when this dog will be attending an Adoption Day, please see our Dogs page on our main website at www.gcgsr.org. \n\nWe operate within a reasonable driving distance from the Greater Sacramento area, the \tCentral Valley down to Merced, and Lake Tahoe. A reasonable driving distance is determined by where one of our volunteers is willing to drive within our areas of service. That means we don't adopt out of our area, to Southern California, or Out of State. \n\n\nThank you for visiting!",

Invisible fencing does not qualify as protection since other animals and strangers have access to the dog. The dogs must be returned to Route 66 Rescue, Inc. if ever given up by the adopter.

She will crawl into your lap and just be so happy if you let her.  Benni weighs 70lbs- is active and very eager to please.  With the help of our volunteers, Benni is working on her basic commands and she walks well on leash. We haven\u2019t tested her with the other dogs at the rescue yet, but are hoping to soon. Benni is very fun girl, very smart and would be a great hiking buddy.  She loves the outdoors and can\u2019t wait to accompany her active family on all their adventures. Benni was rescued by Greyhound Pets from South Korea and we aren\u2019t sure how much \"greyhound\" there is in her!  Regardless, you won\u2019t find a more deserving and social dog who makes up for her unknown past by being super loving and totally delightful. Benni needs a fenced yard and is not suitable for an apartment/condo/townhome.  She will need a home without cats. She is crate-trained and house-trained and calm in the house and car.  Benni is spayed, vaccinated and micro-chipped and available to meet at Greyhound Pets in Woodinville.  Her adoption fee is $500.  For questions or a link to the adoption adoption application, email Kathy at kkreyling11@gmail.com.  You really have to meet this stunning and loving Shepherd mix who is a gorgeous on the inside as well as out!",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\nThis gorgeous 9 month old 52 lb fluffy boy is a St. Bernard mix. Pork Chop is an absolute sweetheart who craves love and kindness. He is a gentle boy that someone has treated harshly -- he sometimes crouches and braces when approached as if expecting to be hit or kicked. As one might expect of a dog named Pork Chop, he's very food motivated and if you offer some tasty treats he is more than happy to be your friend. Once you gain his trust, he will give you a smile and show you his adorable underbite. Pork Chop will likely be around 60 lbs when fully grown, smaller than a St.Bernard, so there's a smaller breed or two in there as well. Pork Chop needs a furever home with a fenced yard and another friendly, playful dog to help build his confidence.\n\nIf you'd like meet Pork Chip, please fill out a foster-to-adopt application at\ndreamhouserescue.org.\nGreater Cincinnati area adopters only please. Pork Chop will need to come back to see us a few times to complete all of the vetting covered by our adoption fee. Pork Chop will go to a furever home on a foster-to-adopt basis, his adoption will be finalized when his vetting is completed. We only adopt dogs into homes where all current pets are spayed/neutered and current on vaccines and heartworm and flea and tick prevention. We do check veterinary references to make sure adopters are compliant with standard veterinary care.",

            "description": "Hubba Hunka Brutus is now available for adoption!\n\nThis BIG boy came to us as a stray and unfortunately, his family was never found. Since being at the shelter, this guy has shown us that he is extremely strong and playful. \n\nBrutus has enjoyed his time with staff members since being here, however it was quickly discovered that he is missing some things in his life. Brutus needs a very strong human companion. This means both mentally and physically strong, as he would benefit from a breed experienced owner who also doesn't mind working out. Due to his size and strength, Brutus will also need a family with no kids under the age of 13. He also would prefer a feline free home, as he has shown increased interest in them and other animals of prey when out and about. As for doggy siblings, Brutus did well with another dog at the shelter and all families with another dog will need to agree to a meet and greet at the shelter. \n\nIf interested in Brutus, please fill out an adoption application on our website at www.lebanonhumane.org and email it to info@lebanonhumane.org",

The next thing we know, a lady called Animal Control and said she had the dogs in her car.  She said she had seen somebody dump them on Highway 75 near Lazy Creek Road.  It was definitely the same two dogs according to pictures.  We named them Thelma and Louise.  Sadly, Thelma, had to be euthanized because the extent of her injuries was too severe.  Louise is with us, and she is an incredibly sweet girl.  She holds absolutely no grudge against humans and will put her paws on your shoulders while covering you in kisses.  She shows marking of collar/rope/chain injury around her neck, but they should easily heal with proper care.  She will be spayed and vaccinated before adoption.",

Please read our eligibility requirements and apply on our website: www.ildoberescue.com/adopt.  After an application is submitted, additional inquiries can email dobes@ildoberescue.com.\n\nMicah is a handsome gentleman who was transferred from a suburban animal control after a legal hold. He seems well-adjusted and has good manners in his foster home, including appearing to be housebroken! He knows a few commands, but he is very treat motivated, so he can learn some new tricks in a recommended obedience course. Micah will go in his crate, but he prefers to be out where the action is. He seems to be fine around the resident Dobermans in his foster home, but we always recommend a slow intro. He has no known history with cats or kids, but he should be okay with kids 10 and up who know how to act nicely around big dogs. Our vet estimates Micah to be around 7 years old. His heart sounds good, but he has some typical muscle weakness in his hind legs. This may be due to not getting enough exercise, or it could be something else, so he will go back to the vet for more diagnostics next week. He navigates the carpeted stairs well but no slick steps. His foster mom put rugs on the wood floors to help him. He walks nicely on a leash, so hopefully some at-home PT around the block or up/down the stairs will bulk that area up. Micah would appreciate a fenced yard (no e-fence) to play with his toys.\n\nThe biographical information provided is correct to the best of our knowledge while the animal is in our care or includes what may have been provided by a previous owner. We strive to be honest and accurate, but animals can change their personalities and behavior when they settle into a new home. IDR+ makes no guarantees based on the information we observe and provide.",

Someone gave us a call to see if we could take them in and couldn\u2019t say no.  Momma appears to be a Basset Hound mix.\n\nBigguns siblings were all white and were adopted right away. Now Biggun is alone and longs for a family to love him. He\u2019s 4 1/2 months old and has medium energy, but does like to play. His favorite thing seems to be to cuddle.  He loves dogs of all sizes. Don\u2019t know about cats.\n\nHe\u2019s a very special boy and any family would be blessed to have him.  If you\u2019re interested in meeting/adopting Biggun, please text us at 713-562-6059. We are located 10 minutes north of Kingwood, in Splendora. \n\nHis adoption fee is $225, which includes 3 rounds of vaccines, his neuter surgery and a microchip. \n",

            "description": "Aspen is a 2.5 year old male mixed breed (our vet's best guess: Springer Spaniel mix, though we don't know where he gets his corkscrew tail!). He is fostered with other large dogs and gets along well, He also previously lived with cats and has gotten along with the one he's met while in our care. \nAspen is a nervous boy who is apprehensive (and very loud) about meeting new people. He seems to warm up more quickly to women, though he is getting used to his foster dad. Because of his uncertainty with new people, we are looking for a home without children. \nHe has a lot of puppy energy and will keep you laughing with his playful personality. He loves his toys and loves playing with his furry foster sisters. He will need a family who walks long distances, hikes or runs. Known to be an escape artist, Aspen needs to be leashed and will need a yard with a 6 ft (or higher) fence. \nHe is a big snuggler once he gets to know you and has not been left alone for long periods. He gets quite stressed when alone and when in his crate, so would like a family member to be home often with him. If you work from home and do a lot of Zoom, he especially likes to say hi to all the meeting participants! \nWe are working on basic commands and leash skills, and Aspen's house training is coming along nicely. He is a smart boy who is eager to please and very loyal to people he knows and trusts.  \nAspen's adoption fee is $250 and includes his neuter, microchip, current vaccinations and deworming,  a leash, collar and some food. Adoption forms and information about the process can be found at www.cleoskarmacaninerescue.com  . We ask that forms are submitted prior to meeting the dogs.  Due to the large number of inquiries that our volunteers receive, we are only able to reply to email messages with an adoption form attached.  \nAspen is currently fostered in Brooks.",

She is a very sweet puppy that is on the submissive side. Cinderella loves to roll over and have her belly rubbed.  \n\nCinderella will need someone who is going to take the time to work with her in various situations to help her come out her shell. \n\nShe will be joining us in Maine on January 30th.\n\nAdoption fees cover age specific vaccinations, spay/neuter, microchip, heartworm/lyme/ehrlichia test, worming and transport fees. \n\nAdoption fees: \nThrough 6 months of age $450; \n7 months to through 5 years $400; \n6 years and under 9 years $325: bonded pairs are $500; \n9 years and older $250: bonded pairs are $300 \n\nFOR PUPPIES: PLEASE READ!!\nHomes considering Puppies must be prepared for:\nFlexible Schedules for Potty Training. Puppies can only hold urine for one hour per month of age. Crate Training for the next 10 months to keep them safe from chewing on everything in your home. Supervision with Children and Obedience training. \nSocialization; both with new people, children and other dogs outside of the home.\nHomes that want a well behaved dog, must be prepared to put the time, effort and costs associated to train a puppy. Well behaved dogs are not born, they are trained!  Please do not apply for a puppy if you cannot or do not have the time for a puppy.\n\nAlmost Home Rescue of New England is a 501 c 3 non-profit rescue; rescuing dogs since 2005. All Adoption applications are completed on line at www.almosthomerescue.net \n\nThis dog is available unless it is marked as Pending, meaning Pending Adoption. This dog is in foster care locally, ONLY if Maine or New Hampshire is listed next to the dogs name; otherwise, the dog is still waiting with our partner rescue for an adoption or foster home in New England. \n\nPLEASE NOTE - We will check your veterinary reference, to ensure that current and prior dogs have a history of being kept up to date on rabies and distemper, have had annual heartworm tests, and are on heartworm preventative at least 6 months of the year. Current pets must by spayed/neutered. \n\nImported dogs are transported on a USDA approved transport with a Health Certificate. All imported dogs are quarantined 14 days prior to getting on transport.\n\n",

Pumpkin doesn't like to be left home alone and would prefer a family who has somebody home most of the time. She would do best in a home without young children, but would be okay with older kids ages 10+ who can respect her space. Pumpkin is great with other dogs and does not care about cats. She can be a bit shy at first, but once you give her a chance she opens up into a sweet, loving cuddle bug!\n\nThis pup's adoption fee is $100, payable in cash only. This includes current vaccines & deworming, spay/neuter (completed before leaving our care), and discounted microchipping upon request at the time of adoption. It also includes an adoption goodie bag and some food to start you off with. \n\nTo adopt, email us about your interest in adopting. We will email our application back to you to download, fill out, and email/fax back to start the process. Once your application has been processed & approved, we will contact you to set up a meet and greet with the pet(s) you are interested in. If all goes well with the meet & greet, the adoption can be finalized and you can take your new furry family member home with you!",

She is good about holding her bowels, but will pee inside if she doesn't realize she needs to go outside until it's too late. We believe that Pumpkin would do well using washable diapers or with frequent trips out to potty, but we're unsure if she will ever be fully house trained due to her upbringing (living in a kennel for the first six years of her life).",

            "description": "Cami is a  4 month old puppy that came from our rescue partner shelter in Louisiana.  She arrived to us along with her brother Cooper.   She would be fine with children 8 and over. \n\nShe is crate trained and is currently working on her house training.  She is very high energy and does not stop, even after long walks. I think she would benefit from a home with lots of people and lots of attention. She is very independent and head strong. She has the typical Mali jump around energy. She has good ball and food drive. She will need an experienced Malinois adopter that will be able to teach her manners. She loves lots of toys. \n\nCami is Malinois and will only be placed in a home with prior Malinois experience.  Her new family must be willing to put in the time and training that it will require for Cami to become a good citizen.  \n\nAdoption fees cover age specific vaccinations, spay/neuter, microchip, heartworm/lyme/ehrlichia test, worming and transport fees. \n\nAdoption fees: \nThrough 6 months of age $450; \n7 months to through 5 years $400; \n6 years and under 9 years $325: bonded pairs are $500; \n9 years and older $250: bonded pairs are $300 \n\nFOR PUPPIES: PLEASE READ!!\nHomes considering Puppies must be prepared for:\nFlexible Schedules for Potty Training. Puppies can only hold urine for one hour per month of age. Crate Training for the next 10 months to keep them safe from chewing on everything in your home. Supervision with Children and Obedience training. \nSocialization; both with new people, children and other dogs outside of the home.\nHomes that want a well behaved dog, must be prepared to put the time, effort and costs associated to train a puppy. Well behaved dogs are not born, they are trained!  Please do not apply for a puppy if you cannot or do not have the time for a puppy.\n\nAlmost Home Rescue of New England is a 501 c 3 non-profit rescue; rescuing dogs since 2005. All Adoption applications are completed on line at www.almosthomerescue.net \n\nThis dog is available unless it is marked as Pending, meaning Pending Adoption. This dog is in foster care locally, ONLY if Maine or New Hampshire is listed next to the dogs name; otherwise, the dog is still waiting with our partner rescue for an adoption or foster home in New England. \n\nPLEASE NOTE - We will check your veterinary reference, to ensure that current and prior dogs have a history of being kept up to date on rabies and distemper, have had annual heartworm tests, and are on heartworm preventative at least 6 months of the year. Current pets must by spayed/neutered. \n\nImported dogs are transported on a USDA approved transport with a Health Certificate. All imported dogs are quarantined 14 days prior to getting on transport.\n\n",

Why this pet is the one for you:How you doin'? Meet Joey. Joey is a friendly guy who loves making new friends and doesn't understand what boundaries are. He is a ladies man, a mans man, a 'hey you over there, you wanna pet me?' man. Yup, Joey is your guy! Going back to the F-R-I-E-N-D thing though, make sure all of Joey's friends are human, okay? He has shown that he may not appreciate hanging out with another dog, whether its living together or just visiting. He prefers to be your only furry friend in fact. Interested in this lug of love?

Virtually all of your questions will be answered by following these instructions: \n\n1. Go to our website www.rescue4all.org \n2. Thoroughly read through the HOW TO ADOPT tab\n3. Thoroughly read through the OUR PROCESS tab\n4. then fill out an online application from your laptop or desktop computer or click on the mobile friendly link on the application page.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWillow is a 1yr old pitbull type dog. She came to R4A as a medical transfer needing rescue from the Spokane Humane Society. \n\n She was owner surrendered in horrific condition....suffering from severe untreated allergies, a massive skin infection, ear infections, covered in yeast, inflamed, hair loss over her entire body, itchy, hot to the touch, swollen, inflamed, and miserable.\n\nThe awesome vet staff at the Spokane Humane Society put her on steroids, treated her for mange (as a precaution), put her on oral antibiotics, medicated baths, and treated her ear infections. \n\nThe vet staff at Spokane Humane Society put \u201csoft claws\u201d over her nails and you can get them for your dog or cat. In Willow\u2019s case this it to try to minimize her causing damage to her skin with her nails. \n\nWe got her allergy tested for both environmental and food allergies so we could see exactly what she needed. \n\nShe has some food allergies: brewers yeast, pork, duck, eggs, beef and cows milk. \n\nHer biggest problem is environmental allergies which we need to manage.\nThis includes several grasses, trees, and fungi.\n\nShe had happy tail (which we are still battling), her ears were ripped and bloody from her shaking her head because of her ear infections and her entire body is very itchy.\n\nThe first goal is to get her body out of this massive allergy attack. \n\nShe does have some anxiety but her foster is working with her to help her learn how to be able to self soothe. \n\nDespite everything you can can see how much better she looks today and she is happy, social, and just a young silly dog!\n\nMORE ABOUT WILLOW:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/rescue4all/posts/3557724850975870",

Once she trusts you, it may take a few days or even a few weeks, she will be your forever companion.  She does very well with other dogs, but prefers the life of a quiet home.  She loves her doggy beds and will sleep there next to your bed all night.  During the day, she will mosey around, take naps, and join you on the couch to lounge some more.  Frieda is not a very active dog, but she does love her meal time!  She is currently on a diet and on a mission to lose another 6 pounds or so.  This girl is so sweet and we are waiting for the perfect home to apply to adopt!  Her wish list includes:\n\u2022\tA fenced yard\n\u2022\tSomeone home most of the time\n\u2022\tSomeone who has patience because she is terrified\n\u2022\tAnother small dog to keep her company if you have to be gone for any length of time\n\u2022\tNo apartment or high rises\n\nBIO:  Frieda came from middle Tennessee when her owner went into assisted living and had to give her up. \n\nFrieda was purchased from a breeder at 4 years old and was never socialized before or after purchase. For that reason, she is very timid around new people and has taken sometime to warm up to us.  We see small baby steps each day but whoever adopts her MUST be patient and not push her.  We can tell she wants to be involved with her people, but is just too scared right now. Frieda is doing well on a doggie door but expect accidents until she trusts you enough to have you let her outside. The previous owner said she was not puppy pad trained.\n\nIf you are looking to rescue, then here you go... Frieda needs lots of love and patience for her to know she\u2019s safe and that she is with her family for the rest of her life.  \n\n============== Information for All Dogs/Adopters ==============\n\nIf you have questions about this dog, please feel free to contact the foster home at the email address listed above.  They have the most up-to-date information concerning the dog and would be happy to answer any questions about the animal. \n\nWe welcome out of state and Canadian adoptions, but we will not ship any dog via cargo.  You will have to make arrangements to pick up the dog or for them to go by ground transport.  If you choose transporting by either volunteers through our organization or by paid transporter, there will be an additional $45 fee added for the required Health Certificate. \n\nWe will not adopt into CT, RI, NH, ME, or MA due to strict laws regarding importation of dogs into those states.  If you have an issue with this, you need to take this up with your legislatures.\n\nTo understand the adoption process through AADR, please review the Adoption Information on our home page.  Transportation options are outlined on that page in Step 3.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this Dachshund please review Read Before You Adopt and then you can complete an Application.\n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN A RESCUE.\n\nPlease don't let the distance stand in your way of finding your newest best friend. We have volunteers that will help your \"new friend\" get up and down the East Coast. We just can't get them from one Coast to the other but some day we hope to have enough volunteers to do that as well.  For now, please look for dogs on your coast.",

Note: Only those with a responsible dog ownership history and excellent vet reference need apply.\n\n(For more pics, visit nr2r.petfinder.com or www.RoadtoRescueLA.org)\n\nINSTRUCTIONS TO APPLY:\n\nPLEASE read profile thoroughly BEFORE applying:\n\nDOG APPLICATION LINK: http://www.roadtorescuela.org/dog-application\n\nBanderos (male)\n\nIntake date: 10/28/2020\n\nChihuahua\n\n7 years old\n\n5.12 pounds\n\nAdoption fee: $170, which includes vetting, microchip and microchip enrollment fee\n\nGood with other dogs: yes\n\nCats: yes\n\nVetting: altered (spayed/neutered), UTD on shots, heartworm negative, fecal negative, dental performed, on monthly flea/tick and heartworm prevention, microchipped\n\nHealth issues: none found\n\nTemperament: very sweet, wants to be near you, gives kisses (he DID NOT come in that way, though which is why it's taken us so long to post his profile)\n\nEnergy level: low; he's fairly chill\n\nGroom needs: low; a bath from time-to-time\n\nBiography: Banderos came to us when his owner became to ill to care for him. The son reached out to us for help and we took him in. He came to us EXTREMELY SCARED, bitey, growly wouldn't eat wouldn't let anyone near him laid in a doggie bed all day and would lunge or bolt if anyone approached. Well, we aren't ones to give up so every day we worked with him. He would jump on the gate when he wanted to come in so we always took that opportunity to pick him up and while he struggled to get away, we held tight. He would slowly calm down and relax. We introduced boiled chicken to him (which he LOVES!). Then all of a sudden like from one day to the next he realized \"hey, these people are nice!\". It was literally like a switch went off. He now jumps on our legs to be picked up he gives kisses he prances around with confidence etc. He's a changed dog. A huge thanks goes out to all our volunteers who really worked with him and didn't give up (and at the risk of being bit which he never actually did but would warn us by snapping the air). One thing we've noticed now that he wants our attention and to be held is he has become lap possessive of other dogs approaching. This is NOT uncommon so please don't hold it against him. Some little dogs can just be that way. Otherwise, he does fine with the other dogs we've had no problem out of him in that regard. We'd love a home for him that is calm and nurturing patient and kind. If you think you are the person for Banderos, we welcome your application.\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTES**\n\n*We do adopt out of state provided the adopter is willing and able to travel to us once approved. We do not ship or transport our animals and there is no exception to this rule.\n\n*All of our adoptable dogs are small, and they are never to be left outside alone, ever! We only rehome our dogs to adopters that plan to have them as inside dogs and part of the family! We do allow adopters with doggie doors, provided there is SECURE fencing. There is no exception to this rule!\n\n*NO SMALL CHILDREN!! As with almost all the dogs at NR2R, young children or a very active household is not recommended. Many of our dogs come to us BECAUSE of small children, thus we do not rehome our dogs to homes with babies or young children. KEEP THIS IN MIND IF YOU HAVE VISITING GRANDCHILDREN AS WELL! Even if the children are older, it would depend on the child AND the parent or parents.\n\n*HOUSETRAINING: We do NOT guarantee that any of our adoptable dogs are housetrained. While most should be easily trained, keep in mind that they live in a rescue where they have access to the outdoors all day and are inside at night. Even if they were surrendered to us as housetrained, it doesn't mean they will automatically be housetrained in your home. Housetraining them should be easy in the right home with time, patience, and consistency.\n\n*We do not guarantee the age, health or temperament of any of the dogs we rehome. Many of the dogs we take in come from animal control and rarely do we have histories and even when we do, many times the histories are inaccurate.\n\n*Only adopters with a responsible dog ownership history and excellent vet reference need apply. If you bring this pet into your heart and home, you will receive in return many years of love, companionship, and loyalty. That's our guarantee.\n\nOther notes: This pet is available for adoption through Ninna's Road to Rescue, Benton, La. We are 501c3 non-profit organization. Our mission is to rescue small-breed dogs and a handful of cats and to re-home them into RESPONSIBLE and CARING forever homes. DOG APPLICATION LINK: http://www.roadtorescuela.org/dog-application\n\nTime may be of the essence if you are looking to adopt a specific animal. We do not reserve animals, unless and until we have approved your application, provided the animal is still available at the time we receive your application. The first APPROVED application we receive will be considered. We are NOT a first come, first serve rescue!! We adopt our rescues out to the RIGHT home, not just A home. Only responsible pet owners need apply.\n\nApplying to adopt does NOT commit you to the adoption NOR does it guarantee the adoption.\n\nCONTACT: Our adoptable pets are updated regularly, but if you want to check the availability of a pet... OR still have questions AFTER reading this profile, message us via our Facebook page. Please indicate the name when communicating with us.\n\nwww.RoadtoRescueLA.org",

These brothers had quite a rough start, but foster mom says they are very quickly adapting to \u201cthe good life\u201d and will be ready for their forever homes very soon!\n\nTheir story is sadly a pretty common one. Irresponsible dog owners who do not take care of, nor care about their dogs enough to get them spayed. This owner\u2019s female was purchased to watch his herd of goats and became pregnant. She had a litter of 8 puppies, and instead of finding them homes he decided to keep them locked in a cow trailer! They received no socialization with humans, no daylight, and no fresh air to run around and play in. This heartless man threw food into the dirty trailer for these pups, but as the weeks passed it became apparent that, due to their breed, they were going to be large dogs, and he knew he could not afford to feed them. Again, instead of trying to find them homes, he fed them less and less, until a kind neighbor began feeding them until he could get them help. It was only after the cruel owner confided in the neighbor that he planned to get someone to come over and \u201cget rid of them\u201d that the neighbor jumped into action. He found a rescue group willing to seize the puppies if the owner promised to spay the mother dog and this wonderful neighbor even offered to pay for it! It\u2019s with the help of all the wonderful people out there that these precious pups are able to go on to live happy lives. \n\nSeveral rescue groups stepped up to each take two puppies, and we are delighted to have Brady and Ramsey! Every day they are learning more and more to just be happy puppies. These boys are gorgeous. They have luxurious golden white fur and sweet faces. They now enjoy very much running and playing in the sunshine, and getting lots of human interaction and affection.\n\nWhen choosing a breed that is right for your family, typical characteristics of that breed need to be considered. The Karakachen is an independent working dog, immensely loyal, and devoted to their masters, trying their best to protect their household at any cost. They have a strong smelling and hearing instinct that is instrumental in making them ideal guard dogs. Though not aggressive while guarding their livestock, these territorial dogs display a highly reserved nature while confronting strangers. Apart from their compatibility with children of the family with whom they are brought up, they will also be able to mingle with other smaller pets if socialized well socialized. \n\nFrequently described as \u201cmajestic,\u201d Great Pyrenees are big, immensely strong mountain dogs standing as high as 32 inches at the shoulder and often tipping the scales at more than 100 pounds. These steadfast guardians usually exhibit a Zen-like calm, but they can quickly spring into action and move with grace and speed to meet a threat. The lush weatherproof coat is all white, or white with markings of beautiful shades of gray, tan, reddish-brown, or badger. They are smart, patient, and calm. The Great Pyrenees is an immensely powerful working dog bred to deter sheep-stealing wolves and other predators on snowy mountaintops. Pyrs today are mellow companions and vigilant guardians of home and family.\n\nRamsey is confident, handsome, graceful, strong, gentle, intelligent, dedicated, loyal and protective. He is a very happy dog that loves all things human and canine, he fits the definition of the breed perfectly, loyal, friendly, smart, courageous, protective but always under control. During our time with this exceptional dog we have been amazed at his gentleness, his intuition and his absolute commitment to his people and their needs. We have found Ramsey above all else to be easy to love, a sweetness that is unrivaled and a beauty that is obvious both externally and internally.\n\nRamsey needs an experienced family, access to a large yard, long walks or runs and an active family that have owned or experience with dogs over 100 lbs. As an adult, his breed requires a confident, experienced owner, one who will gain his respect and understands his independent nature.\n\nRamsey and Brady loves attention, they are active and playful and will make a wonderful companion. He would do well in a house with a large yard and children they can run and play with. Brady and Ramsey have come so far and deserve a loving home where they are safe, have a warm bed, and are considered part of the family. Will you open your heart and home to Brady and Ramsey?\n\nThe Great Pyrenees is a naturally nocturnal breed. Since many predatory animals are nocturnal, this adaptation better enables the breed to guard farms and homes against potential threats in the night. He needs enough exercise to keep him lean and healthy, but not so much that their soft growing bones, joints, and ligaments become over-stressed and damaged. The need to stay in shape, but not in hot or humid weather for fear of overheating.\n\nABOUT OUR RESCUE\n<b>\n<b><b> RESCUE DOG VILLAGE GUARDIAN, INC A 5513C NON-PROFIT ORGAINZATION WEBSITE: WWW.RESCUEDOGVILLAGE.COM\n<b>ABOUT OUR RESCUE</b></b>\n\nWe go the extra mile for every dog and do whatever it takes to make sure that that dog finds happiness, we give 100% and more.

            "description": "Chip is a little over three months of age.  We are not sure what his breed mix is, but we think he is as cute as a button!  He arrived to us from our Louisiana partner rescue.  He was surrendered to a shelter.  He is a sweet boy that can't wait to find his forever home!  \n\nHis foster Mom has this to say about him:\n\nChip is a real sweetheart!   Super friendly puppy and very athletic.  He has good social skills with other dogs (is tolerant and plays well with our own young pup!), and loves to jump up and cuddle in laps! \n\nHe does have lots of energy so I imagine he would do well in an active family that could take him on long walks or have a fenced in yard for him to run around in, that being said he also seems happy to be mellow in the house. He is working on his housetraining.  \n\nHe loves toys!  He is VERY food motivated! \n\nAdoption fees cover age specific vaccinations, spay/neuter, microchip, heartworm/lyme/ehrlichia test, worming and transport fees. \n\nAdoption fees: \nThrough 6 months of age $450; \n7 months to through 5 years $400; \n6 years and under 9 years $325: bonded pairs are $500; \n9 years and older $250: bonded pairs are $300 \n\nFOR PUPPIES: PLEASE READ!!\nHomes considering Puppies must be prepared for:\nFlexible Schedules for Potty Training. Puppies can only hold urine for one hour per month of age. Crate Training for the next 10 months to keep them safe from chewing on everything in your home. Supervision with Children and Obedience training. \nSocialization; both with new people, children and other dogs outside of the home.\nHomes that want a well behaved dog, must be prepared to put the time, effort and costs associated to train a puppy. Well behaved dogs are not born, they are trained!  Please do not apply for a puppy if you cannot or do not have the time for a puppy.\n\nAlmost Home Rescue of New England is a 501 c 3 non-profit rescue; rescuing dogs since 2005. All Adoption applications are completed on line at www.almosthomerescue.net \n\nThis dog is available unless it is marked as Pending, meaning Pending Adoption. This dog is in foster care locally, ONLY if Maine or New Hampshire is listed next to the dogs name; otherwise, the dog is still waiting with our partner rescue for an adoption or foster home in New England. \n\nPLEASE NOTE - We will check your veterinary reference, to ensure that current and prior dogs have a history of being kept up to date on rabies and distemper, have had annual heartworm tests, and are on heartworm preventative at least 6 months of the year. Current pets must by spayed/neutered. \n\nImported dogs are transported on a USDA approved transport with a Health Certificate. All imported dogs are quarantined 14 days prior to getting on transport.\n\n",

He was saved from a kill shelter by the border of Mexico ands was a special request save from the shelter. He is such a sweetheart and won everyone there over. He does have a deformed front foot that may give him a bit of a hitch in his step but it does not hinder him in any way. He was most likely born with it and as far as he knows, he is perfect! We know dogs like Edward are overlooked for the \"perfect\" and cuter dogs but we hope there is a family out there that would love to give him a chance and will enjoy the rewards of all the love this boy has to give.

We know his amazing family is out there waiting for him!\n\nEdward is located for at our rescue in Texas and is available for adoption and transport to Castle Rock, CO on Feb 13th. He is neutered, up to date on all shots, microchipped and his adoption fee is $375. The fee includes the transport cost.

Once she trusts you, it may take a few days or even a few weeks, she will be your forever companion.  She does very well with other dogs, but prefers the life of a quiet home.  She loves her doggy beds and will sleep there next to your bed all night.  During the day, she will mosey around, take naps, and join you on the couch to lounge some more.  Frieda is not a very active dog, but she does love her meal time!  She is currently on a diet and on a mission to lose another 6 pounds or so.  This girl is so sweet and we are waiting for the perfect home to apply to adopt!  Her wish list includes:\n\u2022\tA fenced yard\n\u2022\tSomeone home most of the time\n\u2022\tSomeone who has patience because she is terrified\n\u2022\tAnother small dog to keep her company if you have to be gone for any length of time\n\u2022\tNo apartment or high rises\n\nBIO:  Frieda came from middle Tennessee when her owner went into assisted living and had to give her up. \n\nFrieda was purchased from a breeder at 4 years old and was never socialized before or after purchase. For that reason, she is very timid around new people and has taken sometime to warm up to us.  We see small baby steps each day but whoever adopts her MUST be patient and not push her.  We can tell she wants to be involved with her people, but is just too scared right now. Frieda is doing well on a doggie door but expect accidents until she trusts you enough to have you let her outside. The previous owner said she was not puppy pad trained.\n\nIf you are looking to rescue, then here you go... Frieda needs lots of love and patience for her to know she\u2019s safe and that she is with her family for the rest of her life.  \n\n============== Information for All Dogs/Adopters ==============\n\nIf you have questions about this dog, please feel free to contact the foster home at the email address listed above.  They have the most up-to-date information concerning the dog and would be happy to answer any questions about the animal. \n\nWe welcome out of state and Canadian adoptions, but we will not ship any dog via cargo.  You will have to make arrangements to pick up the dog or for them to go by ground transport.  If you choose transporting by either volunteers through our organization or by paid transporter, there will be an additional $45 fee added for the required Health Certificate. \n\nWe will not adopt into CT, RI, NH, ME, or MA due to strict laws regarding importation of dogs into those states.  If you have an issue with this, you need to take this up with your legislatures.\n\nTo understand the adoption process through AADR, please review the Adoption Information on our home page.  Transportation options are outlined on that page in Step 3.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this Dachshund please review Read Before You Adopt and then you can complete an Application.\n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN A RESCUE.\n\nPlease don't let the distance stand in your way of finding your newest best friend. We have volunteers that will help your \"new friend\" get up and down the East Coast. We just can't get them from one Coast to the other but some day we hope to have enough volunteers to do that as well.  For now, please look for dogs on your coast.",

She was rescued from Rancho Cucamonga. She has some kind of deformity with her mouth specifically her lips. We are still figuring out what exactly is the cause. \n\nWhether it was congenital or an injury. she is being treated for infection. She can\u2019t close her lips. So it looks like she has a permanent smile. Or snarl. Depending on how you look at it! I like to say it\u2019s a smile. \n\nShe is a sweet girl. She is doing great with other dogs in the foster home. Potty training is good. She needs to gently have her mouth cleaned because it tends to get crusty. It can be tender also. \n\nShe is a 3 year old dog who has a long life to live.",

            "description": "Sweet Cinnamon Tiger was left at a remote rural MS shelter at only six months old (12/28/18) and has lived there until now (1/15/21). Three years! While in the shelter, muscular fifty-five pound 3.5-year-old Cinnamon Tiger lived in a large kennel with two other dogs. He was able to socialize with the staff (they gave him a lot of hugs that he really needed) and go on regular walks. He was deemed healthy, friendly, and eager to please. He does jump on people but that is certainly understandable considering he just wants to love and be loved. With time and training he could learn not to jump. He is being fostered by Krissy who is a pet lover, experienced handler, and owner of a dog grooming salon in Norwood, NJ. He interacts with kids and adults with joy. He is motivated by food, praise, or toys, and is housebroken. He responds well to training. He is confident in new situations, but does look to the handler for guidance. He has shown to be indifferent to cats, but we will not adopt him out to a home that has cats. We are looking for a family who has experience with dogs and is interested in the training process. Cinnamon Tiger is looking for a loving, compassionate family who is patient and diligent in providing decompression time to Tiger as he learns his role in a loving household. To apply to adopt Cinnamon Tiger, please visit our website www.peace4paws.org and fill out an adoption application. Thank you so much!! \n\n\nDog Size Guidelines:\nSmall: 25 lbs and under (11 kg)\nMedium: 26\u201360 lbs (12 \u2013 27 kg)\nLarge: 61\u2013100 lbs (28 \u2013 45 kg)\nExtra Large: 101 lbs or more (46 kg)",

All visits and Adoptions are by Appointment Only.   Appointments will be made in the order the inquiries are made and meet the needs of the pet.   Thank you.\n\nMason is a 4 month old Shepherd mix. He has a golden yellow, almost red coat. Mason weighs in at 27 pounds. He is quite social with strangers but will benefit from meeting lots of new people to make him a well rounded adult dog. Mason loves to run and play. He is learning quite quickly to sit for a treat. He's definitely food motivated and very smart. Mason is also learning how to walk nicely on a leash and what the world is all about. Mason will need continued obedience training as he does think it's okay to jump up and say hi. We are confident that he will learn that four on the floor is proper dog etiquette. Mason plays very nicely with other dogs and we think he'd adjust to a cat as well. He will require a home that has lots of time to train and socialize him. We think he may be too much for small children, but older ones would be fine.",

His owner was sadly hospitalized and no longer able to take care of this little guy so he\u2019s looking for a permanent calmer adult home.  He was not housebroken or taken out regularly it seems and is a bit of a marker, so a belly band would be helpful during his adjustment and some patience and consistency as he gets on a schedule.  He can get along with some small female dogs but is the boss and doesn\u2019t like to share attention or food so may be better living as an only dog.  \nHe has the most adorable underbite and smile and gets so excited to greet his people once he feels comfortable.  Please email njwoof@cs.com and submit an application from www.second chance.petfinder.com to meet him by appointment\n\nDue to COVID-19, we will not be holding our Sunday adoption events until further notice, but we can schedule socially distant appointments with a specific dog outdoors at our vet\u2019s office:\nVCA Morris Plains Animal Hospital \n3009 Rt 10 East \nMorris Plains (Denville on GPS) NJ 07950\nNow is the perfect time to open your home to a needy dog!  Submit an application from our website www.secondchance.petfinder.com to speed up the adoption process\nAll our dogs reside in foster care in Northern NJ until adoption. We are a small all-volunteer organization focused on rescuing local dogs from area shelters, as well as accepting some surrenders and puppy mill rescues. \n",

Her weight now is 114 lbs. and she is still a bit on the thin side. Natalia is pretty laid back, she enjoys sleeping on her bed and hanging out with her human friends. With her being so new, her feelings towards cats, other dogs and kids is unknown at this time, but please check back for updates. Natalia cannot have visitors until this Tuesday, but we are accepting applications for her. Natalia is looking for a home with a large yard and where she can be inside when it is cold, as she does not have the hair to be a strict outdoor dog. If interested in Natalia, please keep in mind the bigger the dog the more food they need. Natalia currently eats 6 cups of food a day, so one bag definitely doesn't last very long with this girl! To make an appointment, please call us at 780-826-3230. For an application to adopt, please visit www.bonnyvillespca.com",

Cooper will need to be adopted by a family with previous GSD experience.  This family will need to be able to provide the training and time that a GSD requires to become a good citizen.  \n\n\nAdoption fees cover age specific vaccinations, spay/neuter, microchip, heartworm/lyme/ehrlichia test, worming and transport fees. \n\nAdoption fees: \nThrough 6 months of age $450; \n7 months to through 5 years $400; \n6 years and under 9 years $325: bonded pairs are $500; \n9 years and older $250: bonded pairs are $300 \n\nFOR PUPPIES: PLEASE READ!!\nHomes considering Puppies must be prepared for:\nFlexible Schedules for Potty Training. Puppies can only hold urine for one hour per month of age. Crate Training for the next 10 months to keep them safe from chewing on everything in your home. Supervision with Children and Obedience training. \nSocialization; both with new people, children and other dogs outside of the home.\nHomes that want a well behaved dog, must be prepared to put the time, effort and costs associated to train a puppy. Well behaved dogs are not born, they are trained!  Please do not apply for a puppy if you cannot or do not have the time for a puppy.\n\nAlmost Home Rescue of New England is a 501 c 3 non-profit rescue; rescuing dogs since 2005. All Adoption applications are completed on line at www.almosthomerescue.net \n\nThis dog is available unless it is marked as Pending, meaning Pending Adoption. This dog is in foster care locally, ONLY if Maine or New Hampshire is listed next to the dogs name; otherwise, the dog is still waiting with our partner rescue for an adoption or foster home in New England. \n\nPLEASE NOTE - We will check your veterinary reference, to ensure that current and prior dogs have a history of being kept up to date on rabies and distemper, have had annual heartworm tests, and are on heartworm preventative at least 6 months of the year. Current pets must by spayed/neutered. \n\nImported dogs are transported on a USDA approved transport with a Health Certificate. All imported dogs are quarantined 14 days prior to getting on transport.\n\n",

She is a super friendly and wants to\ngreet you with her whole heart and body!  Lots of love pouring out of this\ncutie!  Sadie is new to our program but is off to a good start.  She has\nbeen friendly with other animals but might overwhelm a little furry friend\ncompanion but would roll just fine with a dog 30 pounds or larger.  She is\nabout 25-30 pounds herself.  So far she is doing well with housetraining.\nWe would love to have a fenced yard for her to sprint around in or a dog\npark near.  We will be posting more about her as we learn more but wanted to\nquickly get her posted so people could begin to fall in love with her.  She\nis currently being fostered in Middle TN in Franklin. If you would like an\nadoption application which is how we begin each potential adoption, then\nemail storkwoods@comcast.net.  \n\nSince she doesn't want to share her bones and\npossibly dog food and will need to be fed separately, no small children\nwould be the best home for her.",

He is guessed to be 7 years old, weighs 40 pounds, was already neutered but not microchipped, received vaccines on Jan 7, but sadly is Heartworm positive. His first treatment for HW is March 9, 2021 (not sure why that far out - was scheduled when the nice lady had him there).\n\nMakas is house trained, but he prefers to be outside.  He does not want to be in a kennel or a fenced area (I've tried both and he escaped from both).   He does come in at night and sleeps on a rug away from the other dogs.  He gets along fine with all the dogs and with the cats.  He does occasionally chase a cat, so I've had to correct him about that.",

            "description": "Meet Beautiful Monroe!\n\nMonroe was picked up by county animal control officers just before Christmas.  Sadly, she was injured and required FHO (Femoral Head Ostectomy) surgery to repair her dislocated hip.  Thank you to our friends at Phoenix Animal Care Coalition (PACC911) who assisted with some of her medical expenses through a critical care grant.\n\nThis beautiful female Belgian Malinois is approximately 2-years-old and sweet as sweet can be.  She loves people, loves to play, and most likely will do well with other dogs once properly introduced.\n\nOnce she has fully recovered, we know she will have a reputation to maintain as a mali, so an active home which is willing to give her lots of physical and mental stimulation is ideal. \n\n\n*****Belgian Malinois Adoption requirements*****\n\nThe dog you have selected is a Belgian Malinois.  This is a breed that has very specific needs for an adoptive home.  Because of their need for a high level of exercise, both mentally and physically and their need for ongoing training, only applicants with demonstrated owner/handler experience with this breed will be considered.  The vast majority of them are not best suited as family pets, but in homes with experienced handlers knowledgeable of their needs and breed characteristics.  We will not place in homes with small children or small dogs/cats.  \n\nIf you can give Monroe an indoor forever home, please fill out our online application on our website at http://www.savingpawsrescueaz.com/adoption-form/  \n\n We will only schedule meet and greets with an approved application. We are an all-volunteer organziation.  It may take a couple of days to process an application and complete reference checks.\n\nThank you for your interest in saving a life!",

She was adopted by an older couple who found that puppies are a lot of work and they were not able to handle her as she has grown larger than expected! She is currently about 45 pounds and ready to head to a new home. She is spayed, up to date on her vaccines and HW negative. She has been great with children and other dogs.  Brownie is active, playful and loving.  She is ready to travel now!\n\nBrownie is currently in TN but will be transported north to New England for adoption. The adoption donation is $500 which includes a health certificate and costs for her transport north.\n\n*Unless stated otherwise, all dogs will be spayed or neutered, on flea/tick product and heart worm prevention medicine (if older than 5 months) and micro chipped prior to adoption.\n\n*Please note that while we do our best to accurately state the breed or breed mix of a dog, we often have very limited information to draw from. Identifying the breed without pedigrees and information on heritage can be very challenging!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our animals, please go to www.angelsamongusanimalrescue.org and fill out an online adoption application. Thank you!\n\nMassachusett's Residents: Effective September 28, 2017 a Quarantine Fee of $120 will be required  (in addition to the adoption fee) to adopt a dog that has been Quarantined. Massachusetts mandates that all dogs entering MA shall be quarantined for 48 hours in a state approved facility.",

            "description": "We are happy to add Missy to our adoptables!!  She has been living at the Our Companions Sanctuary now for almost 6 months and she is now ready for her own home!\n\nShe is the cutest black and white pit bull but then we are a bit biased!  When she first came to us from a local animal shelter she was just learning to leash walk, to be polite when greeting people.  She is still a bit of a work in progress on both of those but she is super smart and is catching on fast!  She simply gets so excited to meet new people!\n\nSome of her favorite things are running in one of the play yards-be careful and protect your knees as she is a bit of a bull in a china shop when she gets the zoomies, forgets just how big she is!!  After a good work out she is happy to come back in, rest up in her crate, or cuddle on the couch.  Like any self respecting pit, she is a hard chewer so tough toys are her fave!  She does however take treats very gently so we know she has a soft side too!\n\nShe does have some specific requests for her new home-she'd like a single family home (no apartments or condos), be the only animal, active teens or adults, a family that is well versed in pit bull ways, a 6' fence with a yard to run it!  \n\nStats: 3 yo, 50 lbs, crate trained.  \n\nIf you would like to know more about this gorgeous gal please call Our Companions Animal Rescue at 860-242-9999 or e-mail to helpline@ourcompanions.org.",

            "description": "LOOKING FOR AN ANGEL:  8 years old / Approx. 49 lbs. \n\nHi, my name is Naomi!  I came to Mostly Mutts from animal control pregnant and with several health issues to address, so Mostly Mutts got right to work helping me to become my healthiest, happiest self.  I am heartworm positive, have glaucoma, some hearing loss and evidence of buckshot pellets under my skin.  My life has been very rough, but I am thankful that only good days and love await me now!\n\n\u2022 OTHER DOGS/CATS/KIDS:  I react fearfully to other dogs and lunge at them when they get too close, so I should be your only dog / I did not react at all to the cat in my foster home, so if you have a dog-friendly kitty, let\u2019s meet to see if we can be pals / I\u2019ve met kids at Mostly Mutts and would likely do well with older children (age 15+) who know to go slow with me, as I need time to warm up.  I was nervous and shaking around kids when they ran and were very active.\n\n\u2022 PERSONALITY/ENERGY LEVEL:  It seems that I\u2019ve had a pretty tough life thus far, so I am a bit slow and shy to warm up, but I have a sweet nature once I am comfortable.  I am a pretty low-key girl who is quite chill and easy going.  I am not known to bark and I welcome affection from my people once I\u2019m comfortable and trust them.  I get the feeling that my good life is just starting, and I\u2019d love a calm and chill type home in which to relax and thrive / My energy level is a calm 3 \u2013 4 which is good since I need to stay calmer until after my heartworm treatment is completed. (see medical below)\n\n\u2022 SKILLS/CRATE/POTTY:  I am a student in the Mostly Mutts University training program, where I am learning lots of great doggie commands with my trainer.  So far, I have mastered \u2018sit\u2019, \u2018down\u2019 and \u2018come\u2019.  I have also shown my good leash manners.  I like treats, so my continued training should be fun / I wasn\u2019t crated in my puppy raising foster home, but my crate manners at Mostly Mutts have been good / My potty manners have been good both at the shelter and in my foster home, so hopefully that will be the case in my new home too.\n\n\u2022 LIKES/DISLIKES:  I spent a lot of time outdoors in my life, so I do love soaking up the sun and hanging around sitting outside with my people.  You may also find that I\u2019m drawn to hanging out under a bush or shrubs.  I\u2019d love a fenced yard where I can spend some time outside with you.  Keep an eye on me though, as I did try to dig under the gate in my foster home.  I like having my back scratched and I love a little canned dog food along with my kibble and I enjoy treats too.  I also enjoy going for walks on quiet streets with my people / I sometimes don\u2019t like taking my eyedrops and I can be nervous in new situations or with people I don\u2019t know yet.    \n\n\u2022 MEDICAL:  I'm current on vaccinations, micro-chipped and spayed.  I just had my teeth cleaned \u2013 likely for the first time in my life!  A grant from the Grey Muzzle Organization paid for me to have that \u2013 Thank you!  I am blind in one eye due to glaucoma and have a little loss in the other eye too.  I\u2019ll need drops in both eyes 3 times a day for life and I may go blind in the near future.  I\u2019m also a bit hard of hearing and unfortunately, my previous owner did not keep me on a monthly heartworm preventative, so I am also heartworm positive, but the good news is that Mostly Mutts will cover the cost of my treatment with their vet, so local adoption only, please.  \n\nI am looking for a calm, loving patient family to see me through my heartworm treatment and love me furever!  My adoption fee is $299.00, and I\u2019m located in Kennesaw, Ga.",

You'll have to take him home and find out! Music is a gentle older guy, good with people and other dogs. He has the cutest stumpy tail that wags slowly in greeting! He is carrying some extra weight right now, and needs help losing 5-10 pounds so that he can move about comfortably. He also has some arthritis in his knees, and a few other medical needs that will require follow-up appointments at our clinic. \n\nMusic is an easygoing guy who wouldn't mind other dogs in the home, but we don't know how he does with cats or children at this time. He seems to respond well to direction, wants to please and interact with humans, and is great company. He does need a home without a set of stairs as he currently cannot traverse them and may need help with just a couple until he is stronger. \n\nMusic came to POMDR from San Jose Animal Care and Services.",

He is a sweet boy learning about life outside of a mill.\n\nIf you think you would be interested, please complete our no obligation application and we can start the process at www.luv4k9s.org. Select Available Dogs then scroll down to application, complete and submit. \n\nA physical secure fence attached to the residence is a requirement to adopt a dog from our rescue. Invisible fence doesn't meet this requirement. No exceptions.\n\nOur adoption area is primarily OHIO. We will consider KENTUCKY, AND INDIANA AND CERTAIN AREAS OF MICHIGAN, WEST VIRGINIA, AND PENNSYLVANIA if it\u2019s the best fit for the dog.\n\nWE DO NOT SHIP NOR ARRANGE TRANSPORTS.\n\nTHE APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED AND SUBMITTED BEFORE WE CAN START THE PROCESS. \n\nIT CAN TAKE AT LEAST 2 WEEKS TO PROCESS AN APPLICATION SOMETIMES LONGER DEPENDING ON VOLUNTEER AVAILABILITY AND NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS RECEIVED SO PLEASE BE PATIENT. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters must understand that each home is different, and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. \nHomes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for:\n1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (ex. a 4 month old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break) \n2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old, to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise.\n3.) Socialization: The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home.\n4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded tenfold, for years to come.\nPlease do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy. Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time consuming and can be expensive. All Dogs Require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well-trained, well socialized dog is more than worth the effort put in to get them there. \n\nOur adoption fee includes spay/neuter, routine shots, rabies, worming, microchipped, heartworm testing and they are on monthly preventative. Visit our website www.luv4k9s.org for more information and to complete an application.\n",

She and her siblings were named after Beauty and the Beast characters. She and her 'sister' didn't get along so the family felt she would be better with a new family. She did great with her two Chihuahua siblings, and may do well with a male dog. She loves to give kisses and plays hard on toys. One of her favorite past times is to bird watch. Cats and kids are unknown at this time. She is currently in boarding and we need her out!Thank you for your interest in adopting a pet from Guardians of the Green Mile Inc. We are a group of individuals that have come together to save the lives of animals that are in danger of being euthanized. We raise funds to fully vet the animals and to provide them with a stable home until they are adopted. All of the dogs in our Rescue are in Foster homes while they are looking for their forever family. The only time we put a dog in boarding is for a Foster to go on vacation if another Foster is not able to care for them. We appreciate your taking the time to fill out the application to adopt one of our Guardians of the Green Mile pets. The questions that we ask are to only find the right fit for all of our dogs and the families that will be adopting them. Adoption donation is $300.00 for dogs over 1 year old and $350 with a $50.00 spay / neuter deposit for puppies/dogs under 1 year old.\n\nClick on this link to access the online form, https://www.jotform.us/form/43196636952162 1/31/21 9:02 PM",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\nIf you are reading about Oakley on PetFinder or other similar websites, please go to Bfpa.org which will provide additional information about Oakley\n\n. All dogs on our website ARE available. OAKLEY MUST HAVE A FENCED YARD AND IDEALLY ANOTHER DOG.\n\nFOSTER COMMENTS: Oakley is a 2 yo husky mix who weighs around 50lbs. If you are an outdoor lover, then Oakley would be your outdoor companion. He loves to go running and hiking.\n\nIs your dog friendly or timid?\n\nTimid but friendly. He just needs time and patience to get to know you. Meaning let him warm up to you. Don't try to train right away. Don't grab at him or hug him until he is comfortable with you.\n\nDoes your dog get along with other dogs?\n\nYes, He loves having a buddy. I think having another dog will help him settle in much better.\n\nHow does your dog do with cats?\n\nHe is great with cats. He tries to get ours to play with him but eventually just leaves her alone.\n\nHas your dog been around children and if so, how did it go?\n\nHe is great with older kids. No child younger than 13. Young kids stress him.\n\nIs your dog vocal or quiet?\n\nHe is quiet. Will occasionally bark when he lays by the front door and sees a dog outside. He will also bark/cry when left alone.\n\nIs your foster dog housebroken? Yes\n\nHow long can your dog be left without having to go outside to do \"their business\"?\n\nUp to 5 hours.\n\nDescribe your dogs activity level.low, moderate or high energy?\n\nHe has a lot of energy. However, if he has a dog buddy to play with, it helps keep his energy down. A couple of walks a day and play with my dogs and I get a lot of downtime out of him. Plays hard, sleeps hard.\n\nDo you think your dog needs a fenced in yard or it this just a \"nice to have\" feature?\n\nHe absolutely needs a fenced in yard. He loves to run back and forth with my husband and loves doing zoomies with my dogs.\n\nAre you crate training your dog and if so, how does the dog react?\n\nHe is completely crate trained. He sleeps in it at times during the day with the door open.\nHe sleeps in his crate at night. I've tried leaving the door open and he will stay in it until about 5am.\n\nAre you leash walking your dog? If so, how is that going?\n\nYes. He is a puller. With the appropriate harness and some training, he will get better.\n\nWhat are some of your fosters favorite things to do?\n\nHe loves to have his belly rubbed and be called a handsome boy. He loves his ball and will run around with it in his mouth and then throw it in the air and grab at it by himself. He has not figured out \"Fetch\" yet. He loves walks and just snuggling (once he is comfortable with you) absolutely loves treats. He wants to be with someone all the time. He is not a loner.\n\nDo you think your dog could be an only dog?\n\nHe could be but I think only if there is someone home all the time. He does not like being alone. Does fine if he has a friend but when alone, he cries and whines a lot.\n\nDo you think your foster could live in an apartment.so would be fairly quiet and OK without their own yard?\n\nNo. He needs a house and fenced in yard.\n\nWhy should someone adopt your dog, what are his/her strong points?\n\nHe is very smart, easily trainable, great companion. However, he is slow to trust. Once he does though, he is very loyal and so loving. Just a really energetic, love bug.\n\nI really feel like a second dog is a must. It really helps with his stress and trust. We need to emphasize he needs time to adjust. It's taken 2 months for him to be a comfortable with us. He also needs to have someone who is home more than not. I'm a Stay at home mom. I do leave the house but my husband is also working from home a lot so he isn't alone ever. However when we leave, we crate him and because of my dogs. His crying out doesn't last long. He needs a lot of time to adjust and learn that he is safe. Very patient people that are very familiar with rescue dogs would be the best fit for Oakley.\n\nSome of the information contained in this biography includes approximations based on our expertise and is not guaranteed.\n\nApplicants must live no further than one hour from Cary NC as our dogs must be seen by a BFPA veterinarian for all medical care prior to adoptions being finalized. Our foster guardians deliver dogs to their new homes for adoption trials and we do home visits to finalize all adoptions. We therefore require applicants to live within an hours drive of Cary NC.\n\nINTERESTED IN ADOPTING OAKLEY?

All visits and Adoptions are by Appointment Only.   Appointments will be made in the order the inquiries are made and meet the needs of the pet.   Thank you.\n\nMarnie is a 4 month old Shepherd Lab mix. She has a light blonde coat and weighs in at 26 pounds.  Marnie is very sweet and can be submissive. She enjoys petting, playing, and working for treats. Marnie is learning sit for a treat and what going for walks on leash is all about. She will  do best in a home that has time to train and socialize her properly. She will need some guidance and positive reassurance when it comes to new things. If she gets afraid, she will just lay down and not move. \"Come on Marnie, it's okay!\" in a happy tone usually gets her to get up and move forward. She just needs to see more of the world to become more confident. Marnie is good with other dogs and we think she'd accept a cat as well too. Marnie can be a jumper, and could certainly knock over little children. We think Marnie would do best in a family home with older children.",

She does have separation anxiety so she would benefit from a household where she is not left alone for long periods of time. \n\nMitten is possessive over toys, food and protective of her home so with that being said she would do best in a home with no children. She would also do well in a home with no other pets. Mitten needs a family who is able to dedicate time to her. She does have a deformed jaw, but she has no trouble eating and her teeth are fine.\n\nThis girl has been given up once already, so we are hoping to find her a forever home!\n\nMitten is spayed, vaccinate, and microchipped!\n",

She has now been fully vaccinated, spayed, and microchipped.   All that's left to do is find her new home and a loving family.  \n\nWe are searching for a fairly active home as Kimber is a young energetic girl who is in love with life!  She is equal portions play and cuddle!   Kimber does well with other dogs, children, and with cats, too!  The family that adopts this dog will be so blessed to have Kimber in their lives! \n\nPlease complete the online pet adoption application you will find in the upper left portion of the homepage of our website, www.BaytownHumaneSociety.org, if you are interested in meeting and adopting Kimber!",

I like to vocalize when playing too.\n\nI'm working on house training and can make it through most of the night without having an accident in my crate or needing to go outside. I still need to be watched closely because I will have accidents if allowed to roam the house too much. I figured out how to ring the bell on the door when I want to go outside, but sometimes forget to let mom know that I need to go out. I'm also starting to learn how to walk on a leash.

He does ok with other dogs with proper introduction and time to get to know them. He has been in a quiet home with just one person. He is very well behaved and knows how to sit, lay down, shake, and is working on stay. We were told he is playful with children, but he has not met any while he has been with us. He does well outside of a kennel when left alone, but he does tend to bark a lot when left alone, so an apartment home may not be best for him. He doesn\u2019t mind cats. He is a really well mannered boy. Please call or email us if you are interested in filling out an adoption application to meet him.",

WOW I can't hardly believe that since he came from the Mingo area as a stray!  He was thin, and a bit lame from running non-stop, so this guy is NOT going to a home without a fenced-in yard that is high enough, 5 feet or more.  \n\nNo fence?  Than you need to be active to take him for walks on leash and hopefully a dog park so he can have Fun doing his favorite activity: FETCH!!!!!!!!!!!!   \n\nI personally think that this guy could compete in some activities like  fetching in water sports or chasing the bunny on a rope game: LURE COARSING.  \n\nHe is a tooting- HOOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nGood around kids. Good around other dogs, however if they challenge him he is not a wimp. \n\nUnsure if housebroke.  Serious adoption families will also talk to Bo's foster mom Karen Sanders.  \n\n$250 to adopt.  Call Marilyn at 573-722-3035.  \n\nPlease share his story.  We would like to get this short coat guy into a warm house.",

I especially love meeting new people! I am a warm and compassionate guy who will follow you around the house to see what you're up to and to see if it's playtime or treat time. I can be a sleepy pup when I'm not busy playing and I love to take naps or just lounge around and listen to the TV. I came to Dolly's very underweight but I'm getting back to a normal and healthy weight by getting my 3 good meals a day. I am trained; I know how to sit, lay down for bed, and I haven't had any accidents in the house. I do have a very peculiar and loud cough but I just use it as my way to get your attention! I have been told I am a great listener, a loyal friend, and the sweetest dog you\u2019ll come to know and love. It's nothing but the truth and I can't wait to meet my forever family to share all my love with! Dean is a male Chocolate Labrador possibly mixed with Spaniel born approximately 12-30-12 and weighs 70 lbs (started out at 55 lbs when he arrived). He is neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, given flea/tick preventative, dewormed, tested negative for heartworm disease & started on preventative. Adoption fee is $375 to help offset the many expenses we have for vetting costs. We rely strictly on adoption fees and donations to continue to save the lives of orphaned & abandoned pets; 100% goes towards their care. If interested in adopting one of our available dogs or puppies, please complete an online adoption application at https://dollyslegacyanimalrescue.org/adopt/ You will be contacted by our adoption coordinator via email after your application has been reviewed & approved to schedule an appointment.",

            "description": "Manny Q is a statuesque, international traveler looking to settle down into his furever home. Manny Q's journey began in Qatar, where he lived on the streets until he was lucky enough to get passage to the USA and a second chance with Furkids. Unlike typical lazy American Greyhounds, Spanish Greyhounds have lots of energy and love to run around. This energetic boy loves spending time chasing a ball, but is happy to take breaks for hugs, snuggles and ear rubs...and those ears are hard to resist! Manny Q loves to show his silly side as he gallops around the yard like a majestic noodle horse. He is an affectionate boy who loves people and would be best suited as the only pet in the home. A lifetime of struggling for food on the streets has made him very protective of his dinner, which could cause problems with other dogs in the home. Manny would be best with an experienced dog owner that can continue his training and understand his quirks.\n Please consider giving this handsome globe-trotting gentleman a forever home! Manny Q weighs 52 lbs., his estimated birth date is 8/21/2018 and his adoption fee is $275. If you want more information about Manny Q, please submit a survey at https://furkids.org/dog-adoptions/application. At this time, meeting our dogs is by appointment only. After submitting a survey, an adoption counselor will contact you to give you more information about the dog you are interested in adopting and to arrange for you to meet the dog. Must be at least 21 years of age to adopt.",

He loves water, even a bath. They are used to sleeping on dog beds inside the house. Dallas believes he is a lap dog and we will never tell him otherwise.

            "description": "Robin is a 1 year old 50lb spayed female German Shepherd Mix. She came to us originally in February of 2020 and was adopted out. She unfortunately came back into the shelter after her previous owner passed. She is very friendly and is energetic here at the shelter. She is heartworm negative. We are open by appointment only to ensure we can properly social distance here at the shelter. We cannot guarantee a specific pet or type of pet will be available at your appointment. We do not hold pets. We operate on a first come first serve basis and while you can put what/who you are interested in in the appointment sign up, all appointments are general dog/cat/other animal appointments since we cannot guarantee what will be available at the time of your appointment. If you would like to set up a non-specific dog or cat appointment we have our scheduling system online now at: https://guilfordcountync.gov/our-county/animal-services/animal-shelter/animal-adoption-scheduling All adopted cats and dogs at Guilford County Animal Services come fully up to date on age appropriate vaccines, spayed/neutered, and microchipped. If you are interested in meeting any of our pets, please visit our website to schedule an appointment online. If you believe this may be your pet, please come to the shelter during business hours and bring your ID, proof of ownership, and proof of spay/neuter and/or rabies vaccination history if you have it. See our reclaiming your pet page for more information. If you have any further questions, please contact us at 336-641-3400 or visit our website at https://guilfordcountync.gov/our-county/animal-services/animal-shelter. Thank you for your interest in helping the animals of Guilford County!",

At 15 years old, his back legs don't work very well and he's easily startled, so he seems to be hard of hearing or possibly deaf. He also is in need of some dental work and mass removal, so he really would benefit from getting out of the shelter and into a home so he can recuperate in a calm, comforting setting In his former home, Burrito was an outdoor-only dog, so we know he'd love to find out what life inside of a home is like. Staffers say Burrito is a friendly and sweet guy. His former owner tells us he has spent time around children and reportedly did well. Burrito came to PACC with his pal, Penny, but he's sharing a kennel with a dog he just met and the two are getting along well. At 15, Burrito does not belong in the shelter, but rather inside of a loving, cozy home where he can spend the rest of his golden years showered with affection. If you've got some room in your home and heart for a dog who really needs it, make an appointment to meet Burrito today.",

I am a pretty chill guy who likes to hang out with people but I can be shy at first. Once I open up you can see how loveable I really am. I also like to lay on comfy beds. I do like a calmer environment so I am not suggested with children under the age of twelve. RAC staff do not know how I will do with other pets in the home at this time. My adoption fee is $125 which includes my neuter, rabies vaccination, microchip, boosters to date and heartworm test. I am heartworm negative.

            "description": "My name is Haven. Some nice man rescued me from the highway by Oasis Park in Ephrata WA. I am mostly blind but healthy otherwise. I am lucky to have great dental care and nice white teeth. I weigh a little over 10 pounds and think I am a big girl. I have to admit, I am very smart, too! When I came to my new foster home, there were many new obstacles I had to learn where they were and most important, where to find food and water. I found that right away, Yippee! The next thing I found was all the new friends I would have for company. There are 4 kitties that don't mind me poking my nose at them to smell them. They just poke me back or rub on me to show me I am welcome. My new foster parents have a dog about my size that is tolerating me, but I think she is kind of jealous that my foster mom plays with me and pets me too. We have learned to both get loves and pets equally and be happy together. But she won't share her bed with me yet. The other thing I learned very quickly is they have this portal (doggy door) to a big jungle area where we go out and go potty and I don't have to ask to go out. It took me a little while to figure out how to get back in by myself, but this makes my foster mom happy and now she doesn't worry I am going to get stuck out there and be cold and scared. Remember, I am a big girl and I learn quickly, LOL! My foster dad says I like to be a woman's dog, because I cry and howl when my foster mom goes out to her \"JOB\". I am so happy when she comes back and holds me and loves on me and my Rat Dog friend again. My foster mom is going to take me to see a doctor to make sure my eyes are ok and I am healthy next week. She will update more about me after that date with a doctor. Thank you for reading, Haven Oasis.\n\n \n\nWe are a fostered based organization. Each of our animals are kept in individual homes where their foster parents can get to know them to help them find the best possible home. If you would like to meet this pet, please fill out our Animal Inquiry form. Once we recieve it, it will be forwarded to the foster home where they will contact you and be able to answer any questions that you might have. We will also be doing adoption events at Hale's Farm and Feed in Ephrata, WA on the 2nd and 5th Saturday of each month from 10am - 2pm.",

Baloo is medium energy and would love a family to go on adventures with. He is selective with dogs, good with cats, and not good with smaller kids. He's had a heart murmur since he was a puppy but it hasn't affected him at all.\n\nBaloo does not seem to be well socialized with dogs outside the home but does live with another dog currently. There are signs of resource guarding over food/toys but in a structured home, he should be okay with other dogs, including slow intros.\n\nAdoption requirements are as such:\n\n\n\tNo children under 16 \n\tNo other dogs \n\tNot a first time dog owner \n\tCentral Florida home \n\tLarge breed experience \n\n\nBaloo has to find his new forever home because his current family has a toddler and they do not feel it is the best home for him anymore. \n\nPlease note, Baloo is part of Happy Trails Animal Rescues rehoming program. She has not been tested or evaluated and the information gathered is from the current owners personal statements regarding health and temperament.

He has a healed fracture on the distal end of the femur on his left hind leg, so he walks and runs with a stiff leg, but it doesn't slow him down one bit! It also doesn't seem to cause him any discomfort. \n\nBruce always seems to be in a great mood, he loves everyone he meets and they love him too. He enjoys playtime like all cheery pups do, followed by some cuddles and snuggles. He is a charming young boy who deserves all the love in the world. \n\n\n*Kindly note: Prior to Bruce's sterilization surgery on February 17, we are only able to consider applicants who reside in the following Virginia counties: Clarke, Culpeper, Fauquier, Loudoun, Prince William, Rappahannock, Stafford and Warren.",

            "description": "Bentley needs his forever home as kennel life is definitely not for him!  He is an 80Lbs 4 yr old Chocolate Lab full of love, strength, motivation. He is dominate in nature.  We are not sure if he is cat friendly.  If there are children in the home, because of his size and strength, we would like them to be older.   Bentley is pretty smart and learns quickly.  He does well on a leash and is a huge fan of snow! What we have learned about Bentley since he has been with our shelter is that he absolutely hates peanut butter and he tends to have issues with men.  He loves the outdoors and would love a sunny porch to hang out on but also have nice spot inside to be with his family.  His adoption fee is $100.00.  He is neutered, UTD on shots, microchipped and heartworm negative. If you would like to meet him, please call 712-644-3003.  \n\n**Harrison County Humane Society of Iowa reserves the right to find the right fit for our animals and not necessarily the first interested individual or family.**",

She loads and rides well in a car. She knows \"sit\" and \"down.\" She gets along well with most other dogs. She is shy initially but warms up quickly with a little reassurance. She's a real sweetheart, very affectionate and cuddly. Sunshine can jump a 4 foot fence. Sunshine would do best to go to a home with a securely fenced yard where she can get the exercise she needs.\n...................................If you would like further information or would like to request an adoption application, please e-mail us directly at hss@cablelynx.com.

            "description": "Cercius came with an uncertain past. A history of dog aggression and growling toward small children. She met my resident female PitBull with no fireworks. My pitbull is very laid back. While neither dog plays together they are mostly civil toward each other. Cericus knows how to sit, lay down and shake with either paw for a treat. She does throw her paws at you and will play with a tug toy.(super strong) She loves to actually sit on you as most Danes do. She is 100% house broken. She does pull quite hard on a leash and does not like the halter style gentle lead. She carries a bone around as her security blanket and will growl when you try to take it but she will give it to people without anymore than a growl. However she will go after the resident dog if she walks near while she has the bone. Today was the first day she drew blood over it but a mouthy spat happens daily. Once they spat they are fine like nothing happened. For this reason I would recommend she be an only dog and not be around small children. She sleeps on her dog bed even when she is welcomed into the human bed. She is fine for baths. She does have some old lady lumps and bumps and seems to have the start of hip arthritis. If approved I want to start her on Adequan and have her teeth cleaned. She does not counter surf or beg for people food. She is still on the thin side. She does seem to guard the house and will bark and growl at stranger's. Overall she is a super sweet gal that loves car rides, treats, and her special bone.",

If the animal has \"HAS APPLICATION\" listed, they are still available to receive additional applications but also may be in the process of being adopted soon. Apply for a DOG: http://www.citydogsrescuedc.org/adoptable-dogs.html\n\nInterested in saving more lives? Foster a dog today! Learn more, see our list of dogs needing foster, and apply, https://www.citydogsrescuedc.org/foster-a-city-dog.html\n\nCity Dogs Rescue & City Kitties is a foster based rescue in Washington, DC. We do not have a shelter. We focus on local adoptions in DC and the metro area of Maryland and Virginia. CDR&CK has a thorough adoption process in order to find the best possible fit for each of our dogs and cats (we do not operate under a first-come, first served model).\n\nUpon accepting a new cat or dog into the organization, we provide a basic vet visit that includes necessary vaccinations, disease screenings, deworming, microchips, and spay/neuter (unless specified). We do not provide a comprehensive medical exam prior to adoption. As a result, sickness, injury, and disability may exist unbeknownst to CDR&CK. City Dogs Rescue & City Kitties is not responsible for payment of any vet care, including known and unknown medical conditions once a cat or dog is adopted from us. \nDog specific: Rabies, DHPP, Bordatella vaccines. They are tested for HW, Lyme, Ehrlichia, Anaplasmosis.\n\nMost cats and dogs will have a house training accident in the initial days in their new home and we cannot guarantee any pet is housebroken or crate trained.\n\nWe also update our Facebook page daily with new cats and dogs.",

She\u2019s been passed around from home to home for the past 5 years.  This time she went from a friend of another friend who also was unable to keep her.  Luckily, Brownie landed at SCDR and we are determined to find Brownie a \u201cforever\u201d home.\n\nBrownie arrived at her foster home with a cautious attitude.  She made friends quickly with her fellow foster dogs, learned the location of the dog door and took full advantage of the privilege of going in and out at her own volition.  She is not fond of going outside to potty when it is raining. (No one else in the foster home was making an effort to go out in the rain either.)\nBrownie loves MEN, especially if they have a beard.  Brownie also loves going for walks and rides nicely in the car.  Her favorite thing was to be a \u201clap dog\u201d as soon as she sees the man of the house sit down on the sofa.  Retired gentlemen are encouraged to apply for Brownie.  They have the best laps.  Brownie is a \u201cbig bed dog\u201d.  On the very first night at her foster home, she let her humans know that she was not going to sleep anywhere else.  All righty then, what\u2019s one more dog in the bed where there are several there already?\n\nBrownie is healthy, and her vaccinations are current.  She is microchipped.  We don\u2019t know how she feels about cats.  She is well socialized and would be fine with another small male dog.  Brownie is safe with dog-savvy children over 10 years old.  No babies, toddlers or pre-schoolers please.  Brownie is a \u201cchiweenie\u201d, so a home with stairs is not a serious issue.\n\nBrownie is fully vaccinated and she\u2019s been microchipped.  If you can give Brownie a home for the rest of her life, please contact Dena at (562) 694-6868.or email Dena@SCDR.org.  An adoption application and home check are required.\n\nAdopt Brownie for a tax-deductible donation of $400.00.\n",

You can make an appointment to meet available dogs at our ADOPTION CENTER by going to:\n https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f084ea8ae2da5f49-meet and available cats at MEOW PALACE by going to:\n https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f084ea8ae2da5f49-meet1. \n\nFor animals in FOSTER homes, please submit an online application and an adoption team will reply with next steps. We thank you for your patience as we work to keep saving lives during this difficult time. \n\n\nPLEASE VISIT THIS WEBSITE TO FIND THE ADOPTION QUESTIONNAIRE: \nhttp://www.homewardtrails.org/adopt-a-pet/adoption-forms/\n\nPlease fill out our dog adoption questionnaire and e-mail it to KayLynne.Parker@gmail.com.\n\nMano is working on adjusting to his new surroundings. He is a very sweet, yet fearful boy. He needs a home with a secured tall fence, no young kids under 12 & another dog in the home as he LOVES DOGS! He does not walk on a leash as of yet & would do best in a quiet/calm home. Professional Training is highly recommended to help Mano be the best boy he can be! If you have time & patience for this handsome boy the rewards will surely be worth it! \n\nAdoption Coordinator: KayLynne Parker\nLocation: Foster Home\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $475. This fee includes spay/neuter and microchip. \n\nWe are proud to partner with the following veterinarians who offer a free first exam for your animal, exclusively for HT adopters: Caring Hands Animal Hospital, Palisades Veterinary Clinic, Sunshine Animal Hospital and Clarendon Animal Care and all VCA Animal Hospitals.\n\nAdditionally, any VCA hospital will cover illnesses up to $250 at no cost to any Homeward Trails adopter.\n\nWe also provide free online workshop with a professional dog trainer at Fur-Get Me Not within the first 30 days of adopting - just for HT adopters in the Arlington/Alexandria/Falls Church/DC area. Start your new dog out on the right foot with this valuable, expert guidance FREE!\n\nYou can save animals like this one by becoming a foster! Fosters are like way stations between high kill shelters and forever homes. We need fosters so that we can save dogs before they are euthanized at the shelters. If you are interested in becoming a foster, please check out our information about fostering by visiting http://www.homewardtrails.org/foster-a-pet/dog-and-cat-foster-program\n\n\n\nCOME MEET ADOPTABLE DOGS EVERY SATURDAY AND SUNDAY from 10AM - 4PM at the Homeward Trails Adoption Center- 11116 Fairfax Station Road, Fairfax Station VA 22039! **Note that puppies are in foster homes, not at the Adoption Center.",

He is neutered and ready for adoption. Bendy does know how to sit and enjoys the company of the staff and volunteers here. He does seem to destroy some toys so he would love to play. He has lots of energy and can be perfect for an active person or couple. We received a bit more info on him since our first post about him and we were told that he has issues with being woken up. He is not a fan of being woken from his sleep, but who is? Bendy may know he's handsome, but he needs his beauty rest to look this good! Because of this, we believe that having his own area to sleep, whether that be a crate or a separate dog bed/room would be perfect. Due to the sleep issues, he will not be adopted into a home with younger children. Older kids and teens may be considered if they understand his need for sleep. \nHe hasn't shown aggression here but that is due to this environment. If you are interested and have the right type of set up for this handsome fella, please call to set up an appointment at 715-284-0251.",

            "description": "STAR is a foster-based rescue. All our rescue animals stay in foster homes until adoption. We do not have a central facility. If you want to meet any of our adoptables please submit an application.\n\nHi! My name is Chica!\n\nI am about 5 or 6 years old and I weigh about 44 lbs. My foster mom says I am a happy-go-lucky girl and a joy to have around. I always know how to make her smile. I have lived with kids in the past, and I probably would be okay living with dog savvy cats or dogs with slow and proper intros....but honestly I'd probably prefer to just be the only pet so I can get the undivided attention I deserve :) Some people call me a \"low rider\" because I kind of have a pitty face, but short beagle legs and body. I guess that also makes me \"cute\" because I get called that a lot as well!\n\nTo tell you a little bit about where I came from, I used to live life outside on a chain, no matter the weather. My old owners didn't take the best care of me. The amazing volunteers at STAR found me sick and weak, suffering from heatstroke. They got me surrendered and rushed me to the emergency vet. I was treated for dehydration, a severe UTI infection and they also discovered I had a heartworm infection. All of this took a toll on my body and I'm greatful they rescued me just in time!\n\nNow that I'm feeling SO much better and I'm back to my normal self, I am currently in the process of going through heartworm treatment, though I am available to be adopted at anytime. In the the meantime, for about another month, my activities will need to be kept to a minimum - so all those fun runs and adventures and hikes will have to wait, but that's perfect because it's cold outside right now anyway ;)\n\nOne of my favorite \"go-to\" snacks is pill pockets, even though I really don't need to take medications anymore. I also really love to chew on bones and bully sticks, and generally I don't chew on things that aren't mine and I don't tend to destroy my stuffed toys. I walk pretty well on a leash, but I don't get too much practice since currently I have a fenced in yard.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting me and taking care and loving me, please fill out an application or you can email my foster mom at heather@savingtailsanimalrescue.org My adoption fee is $265 and includes all my vetting up to date, some food and treats, toy, leash and collar.\n\nThank you for considering a special girl like me!\n\nAll STAR animals come vetted, Up to Date (UTD) on age appropriate shots and testing, spay and neutered (if of age,) and microchipped.\n\nAGE DISCLAIMER:\nUnfortunately, most of the orphaned animals that come into our rescue looking for homes don't bring birth certificates. Sometimes we know our pets' ages. Sometimes we don't. So we make our best guess based on the condition of their teeth and the veterinarians best guess.\nBREED DISCLAIMER:\nVisual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality,\nnot\nby breed label .\nMicrochips:\nFor the safety of our dogs and peace of mind of our fosters and adopters, STAR microchips all dogs prior to adoption with Petlink Microchips. Please understand that all dogs MUST still wear a collar with ID tags (which include your current information) AT ALL TIMES. Please remember, our foster dogs are extremely important to us-- we will always take any of our dogs back, if for any reason you can't keep your adopted dog. Never surrender him/her to a shelter!",

We are a foster based rescue. There is no facility to visit.\u00a0\n\nGoldie is an adorable male Chihuahua mixed with possibly Dachshund or Corgi.  His owner recently passed away and he has found himself starting over again.  He is enjoyable and sweet and his foster family thinks that he is pretty terrific.  \n\nGoldie and his person were always together and he would love a home where his person or people are home more often than they aren't.  He is presently learning proper pp habits in his foster home and will need a family that will continue with potty training.  He wears a belly band while he is being trained to prevent any accidents in the house.\n\nGoldie is a sociable fella and enjoys the company of other dogs and even likes cats.  He would enjoy a home where he can go on walks with another doggie companion.  Goldie hasn't been around children so we are asking for a home without children under 12. \nGoldie is 8 years old and weighs 17 pounds.\n\nAdoption fee is $150.00\nSave-A-Mutt is a registered 501c3.\n\nPlease note, we have approximately a 300 mile adoption radius. We don\u2019t ship dogs.  Once approved you must pick them up in Snohomish County, WA\u00a0*Due to the Border Closure to Canada - we are currently not accepting Canadian Adoption Applications*.

If you are interested in meeting and adopting, please complete an application on our website (uaaf.org).\n\nOliver is one of a litter of five puppies born November 14, 2020. His mom was surrendered while she was still pregnant. The puppies have had a really good start to life. They have stayed with their mother from birth to the present day. In their foster home, they have been exposed to animals, people and lots of different sights and smells.  They are all confident and adventurous, just like puppies should be!\n\nOliver was the runt of the litter, but you\u2019d never know it to look at him now. He is as active, playful and pudgy as his brothers and sisters. Oliver is also very interested in cuddling with his humans. He is a very sweet boy.\n\nBefore you adopt a puppy, remember that they like to chew, chew, chew when they are bored, so they will need plenty of exercise and toys to chew on.  Oliver and his brother, Cyrus, are available for adoption now. Their sisters, Brandi and Scarlett will be available in a week or two after they are spayed.\n\nOliver has been neutered and microchipped.  At 9 weeks, he has only received his first canine combination booster shot. His adoptive parents will need to get his second and third boosters, as well as a rabies vaccination and heartworm test when he is six months old.\n\nWe are committed to doing our part to control the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Until life goes back to normal, we will not be doing adoption events at PetSmart. Instead, we will be doing individual meetings by appointment and practicing social distancing at each meeting.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete our online adoption application at www.uaaf.org. For more information, or to schedule an appointment, call/text Kirsty at (435) 671-0985, or email kirsty.ju@gmail.com\n",

Skittles has met our veterinarian and our behaviorist plus has hung out with a bunch of our staff members too. He did outstanding with our entire team! So much that our behaviorist left a great review in his file. This is part of her report: \n\n\"Skittles seemed to be a super-smart dog who learns commands very quickly. He knew \"Sit\" and by the time we were done with everything he learned \"Touch\" and was catching onto Shake and Down. If startled he will lower himself or try to get away. He would lower and flinch if I touched his butt but quickly loosened and raised body once he realized I was just petting him. Seems very dog friendly but can be rude when first introduced. As long as the adopters continue working on his manners with both people and dogs I think he will thrive in almost any home (as long as there are no cats). I truly can't say enough how smart and willing to please this sweet boy is.\"\n\nSkittles is house-broken and crate trained. He is good on leash too. \nSkittles is already neutered, vaccinate, heartworm tested negative and up to date on all flea/tick and heartworm medication. To meet Skittles, please check out our online survey at http://www.secondchancenorman.com/index.php?survey",

She came to us with her brother, Ranger. She had demadectic mange (the non-contagious kind) and is due to stress. We have been treating that and she has already improved dramatically. She loves attention and would make a great family pet. She would do well with other dogs and kids. She weighs about 35 pounds and is about full grown. If you would like more information, please contact our shelter at 870-214-1745 or visit her at 17379 Highway 9, Mountain View, Arkansas. You can also go on-line at schspets.org and complete an adoption application.",

You may be required to travel if approved for adoption.\n\nLola came to us as a puppy, frightened and needing a little extra time to settle in. And that, she has! This beautiful, high energy pup will melt your heart. Lola is likely to nap quietly in a sunbeam, snuggle next to you in a comfy chair, then race around the yard showing off her athletic skills and agility. She would do best in a home with another fun loving dog to wrestle with, teen aged children or older if any, a fenced in yard so when she runs like the wind you don't have to chase her, and a family that has the time and patience to keep up her training. She is super smart and anxious to learn and please. She will return tenfold every bit of love and kindness directed her way. Lola is with her foster family nearby and they are willing to have you meet Lola and spend some time getting to know this perfect dog!\n\nApplications can be submitted through https://lgarinc.org/adoption-application/.

All applications are subject to review and approval and a tax-deductible adoption donation is required to be paid prior to adoption day.\n\nPlease note that you must be 25 years of age to adopt and we reserve the right to refuse adoption to anyone.

He didn't get along with one of the dogs in his previous home, but did well with the other two. \n\nHe's a happy boy and his tail is always wagging. He loves people and is always excited to go out and about. He's short in stature, but is a strong dog and could benefit from some additional training once he's in the home. Who could resist this sweet face? \n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, all of our operations are currently by appointment only. Please call our office in regards to all adoption inquires. \n\nWe recently moved to our bigger, better location at 730 Church Street! Our original phone number is back up and running! Please call 724-339-7388 to schedule an appointment! Thank you!",

Hell fetch pretty much whatever you throw for him, then bring it back to you and drop it nicely at your feet. Does he like treats? Duh. Hes a dog. But if Otis had to choose between chasing a ball and chasing a treat, hell choose the ball. This affinity for play is a good combo with the fact that hes, well, chunky. Otis might describe himself as well rounded, literally. He needs to lose a bit of weight, and regular games of fetch would be an easy, fun way to do that. Could you give this playful boy a home where he can live his best life? Click here to view my behavior notes.",

Making slow improvements with Tiny. \n\nThey will both be vetted and spayed on 1/18/21. Let\u2019s hurry and get them into a new loving home soon. They do not need to be adopted together but would be a great idea to keep them together for wonderful playmates. Such wonderful souls. Their adoption fee is 225 each or 375 for the pair.\n\nTheir adoption fee includes their full vetting.

Those teeth are super white. They both have a super underbite. Tiny is still stand-offish but Kitty is a love. Kitty snuggles and plays all day, and at night in bed with her foster mom. Making slow improvements with Tiny. \n\nThey will both be vetted and spayed on 1/18/21. Let\u2019s hurry and get them into a new loving home soon. They do not need to be adopted together but would be a great idea to keep them together for wonderful playmates. Such wonderful souls. Their adoption fee is 225 each or 375 for the pair.\n\nTheir adoption fee includes their full vetting.

She plays hard-of-hearing when she is outside, sun high in the sky and warm and she has a nice, thick patch of grass to dive into, roll over on and scratch her own back! It\u2019s amazing she hasn\u2019t thrown her back out as crazy as she gets wiggling back and forth! When she hears your voice getting closer, she will get up, shake the grass off and make you think she is finally going to be obedient only to watch her ZOOM past you to another patch of grass so stay out of her way! If this tank of a girl runs into you, you WILL go down!  Each time, she seems to be laughing from sheer joy!!\n\nFiona has beautiful manners in the house and has impeccable potty manners. She LOVES big, soft comforters and \u201cwoobie\u201d ? toys! Did I mention that she LOVES people??\nPLEASE CONTACT CELESTINE IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN FIONA 832-659-2576\n",

            "description": "The Three Musketeers (Athos, Porthos, and Aramis) are lab mixed puppies rescued from the city of San Bernardino, CA. While a volunteer was washing his car, a man stopped by the car wash. The man put the three puppies who seemed to be a month old in a plastic pen outside of his vehicle and a guy working in the wash place started washing the back seat of the man's car. Our volunteer asked the owner of the puppies why he had left the puppies in a small pen. He said that his female dog gave birth to them a month ago and he was on his way to relinquish them to the nearest shelter as he could not take care of them. While on his way, the puppies urinated the back seat of his car and left it dirty. The man got mad and decided to immediately stop by a car wash to save his newly purchased car. \n\nThe owner of the three puppies stressed on the fact that he does not want to keep them and what made the matter worse from his point of view is that they urinated his car. Our volunteers mentioned to the man that shelters are open by appointment only. Therefore, they will not allow him to walk-in. The man was upset as he wanted to get rid of the puppies as soon as possible. Thus, our volunteer asked the rescue to take position of the puppies who seemed so malnurished with their rib cages showing under their skin. From day #1 and after the first wellness exam, the puppies followed a deworming protocol along with a nutrition protocol. As they continued to grow and gain weight, the puppies received their shots of vaccines and waited in the rescue enough to the receive complete boosters of their vaccines. At a foster home, the puppies were socialized around kids and other dogs. Finally, the puppies were operated for Neuter and received their rabies shot. (all the basic necessary veterinarian work needed for a healthy puppy was done on the expenses of the rescue). All vaccines are valid for 1 year.\n\nAll puppies are sweet, energetic, and super outgoing. They can lay with you on a couch watching TV or go with you on a long walk. \n\nSince they are still puppies, they are easy to train and adapt to your lifestyle. \n\nIf you think that the description of the puppies match your criteria in a companion, please consider giving them a loving home. \n\nThe adoption process consists of three steps: \n\n1- Fill and submit an adoption application through the following link\n\nwww.petember.com/adoption-application \n\n2- If approved, a one-to-one meet and greet will be scheduled between the adopter, his family and the puppy to be adopted. You can bring your current dog too. (Make sure to wear a mask and abide by social distancing guidelines).\n\n3- Finalizing adoption paperwork for the puppy, paying adoption fee, and take the puppy home same day. \n\nThe puppies will be adopted very soon. We receive hundreds of applications for each dog. Submitting your application earlier will increase your chances of being accepted. \n\nApplications will be reviewed immediately.",

I look forward to sharing my sweetness with a loving family. If I am the friend for you, please complete the form found on hsnb.org/adoptions. My adoption fee is $300. Thank you!

            "description": "STAR is a foster-based rescue. All our rescue animals stay in foster homes until adoption. We do not have a central facility. If you want to meet any of our adoptables please submit an application.\n\nHi! My name is Marshmallow! My foster mom calls me Momma Marshmallow because I am a momma to 4 sweet babies. They have all been adopted into loving homes, and now it is my turn to find my forever family!! I am a petite little thing, weighing in about 40-42lbs. I am a little shy at first to new people, but I love treats and snacks and once I warm up to you, I will always be at your side. I LOVE to be pet and cuddled and held. I get along with other animals including dog savvy cats. I love to be home and chill with my family, but I also ride really well in the car if we go someplace new. I don't pull to hard on a leash, and I listen to my foster mom. I like to stay close and I'm a very happy girl that's easy to please. If you are interested in meeting a girl like me, please fill out an application as that is the first step. www.savingtailsanimalrescue.org\n\nI am up to date on my vaccinations, spayed, and microchipped. I am current on flea/tick/heart worm medication and I am heartworm negative. I would come with a leash, collar, some toys, treats and food. Thank you for considering a sweet girl like me!\n\nAll STAR animals come vetted, Up to Date (UTD) on age appropriate shots and testing, spay and neutered (if of age,) and microchipped.\n\nAGE DISCLAIMER:\nUnfortunately, most of the orphaned animals that come into our rescue looking for homes don't bring birth certificates. Sometimes we know our pets' ages. Sometimes we don't. So we make our best guess based on the condition of their teeth and the veterinarians best guess.\nBREED DISCLAIMER:\nVisual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality,\nnot\nby breed label .\nMicrochips:\nFor the safety of our dogs and peace of mind of our fosters and adopters, STAR microchips all dogs prior to adoption with Petlink Microchips. Please understand that all dogs MUST still wear a collar with ID tags (which include your current information) AT ALL TIMES. Please remember, our foster dogs are extremely important to us-- we will always take any of our dogs back, if for any reason you can't keep your adopted dog. Never surrender him/her to a shelter!",

Precious was by his side for the last 15 years and will now wait for him at the Rainbow Bridge. Suzanne, Karen & Tom\n\nOphelia and her 5 siblings were born around January 7, 2020, and may top out in the 60-65 pound range. Please understand we are truly guessing on the breed for this family. Some of the siblings have a more Retriever look while others we feel have more of a Collie appearance to them. They are wonderful with the other dogs and adore us, humans. It is likely they did not have much human interaction while growing up and so we anticipate you will have some basic training to do. They are sweet-natured, intelligent, teens, so training should go smoothly.

Isabella was surrendered to a high kill shelter in the south along with 11 other dogs from the same home. For breeds, we feel they are mostly Chia/Terrier mixes but there are likely a dozen more breeds mixed in. They get along wonderfully with the other dogs and have sweet, happy, dispositions. You will likely have some housetraining to do but it shouldn't take long as they seem eager to please and are smart little cookies. This is all we know so far and we will be learning as we go and so will you!\nThe Adoption Fee for this dog is $500.00\nAdoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a 'complete' pet. We accept CASH or Visa/Mastercard ONLY.\n\nJoyful Rescues has no funding except for our adoption fees and miscellaneous donations. Pet care and vet bills are expensive - you must be ready to take on this financial (as well as emotional) responsibility. YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 25 YEARS OF AGE TO ADOPT A DOG FROM JOYFUL RESCUES\n\nWe keep our pet list as up-to-date as possible. As soon as a pet is adopted, it is removed from the list.

            "description": "Happy Birthday Gary Groot!My siblings and I decided to sponsor this life saving transport to honor our father's 81st birthday. Our father, Gary Groot, is the main reason we are all animal lovers. We grew up watching and learning how to properly pamper our puppies and he instilled in us the importance of adoption; how it saves lives. My father just lost his beloved Precious who he loved with all his heart and took her everywhere, even bought a travel trailer so she could join him on mission projects for the church. Precious was by his side for the last 15 years and will now wait for him at the Rainbow Bridge. Suzanne, Karen & Tom\n\nMoose and his 5 siblings were born around January 7, 2020, and may top out in the 60-65 pound range. Please understand we are truly guessing on the breed for this family. Some of the siblings have a more Retriever look while others we feel have more of a Collie appearance to them. They are wonderful with the other dogs and adore us, humans. It is likely they did not have much human interaction while growing up and so we anticipate you will have some basic training to do. They are sweet-natured, intelligent, teens, so training should go smoothly. This is all we know so far and we will be learning as we go and so will you.\nThe Adoption Fee for this dog is $500.00\nAdoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a 'complete' pet. We accept CASH or Visa/Mastercard ONLY.\n\nJoyful Rescues has no funding except for our adoption fees and miscellaneous donations. Pet care and vet bills are expensive - you must be ready to take on this financial (as well as emotional) responsibility. YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 25 YEARS OF AGE TO ADOPT A DOG FROM JOYFUL RESCUES\n\nWe keep our pet list as up-to-date as possible. As soon as a pet is adopted, it is removed from the list. If a pet is still showing, it is still available for adoption.\n\nCan't Adopt Me?

Ernest was surrendered to a high kill shelter in the south along with 11 other dogs from the same home. For breeds, we feel they are mostly Chia/Terrier mixes but there are likely a dozen more breeds mixed in. They get along wonderfully with the other dogs and have sweet, happy, dispositions. You will likely have some housetraining to do but it shouldn't take long as they seem eager to please and are smart little cookies. This is all we know so far and we will be learning as we go and so will you!\nThe Adoption Fee for this dog is $500.00\nAdoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a 'complete' pet. We accept CASH or Visa/Mastercard ONLY.\n\nJoyful Rescues has no funding except for our adoption fees and miscellaneous donations. Pet care and vet bills are expensive - you must be ready to take on this financial (as well as emotional) responsibility. YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 25 YEARS OF AGE TO ADOPT A DOG FROM JOYFUL RESCUES\n\nWe keep our pet list as up-to-date as possible. As soon as a pet is adopted, it is removed from the list. If a pet is still showing, it is still available for adoption.\n\nCan't Adopt Me?

            "description": "In memory of Mike and Laura Bysiek.Sisters Jean (Mike) Gonska and Lorraine (Larry) Diggs, wanted to leave a lasting legacy in memory of their loving parents by establishing the Mike & Laura Bysiek Memorial Fund at the Cattaraugus Region Community Foundation to support a number of nonprofit organizations in the community each year.\nAs long-time active volunteers at Joyful Rescues and seeing the amazing, awe-inspiring, life-saving, tireless work that is done every day there, it was a wonderful option to be able to sponsor a life-saving pet transport annually in their honor.\nFarley was born around January 7, 2020, and weighs about 25 pounds. Farley was surrendered to a high kill shelter in the south along with 11 other dogs from the same home. For breeds, we feel they are mostly Chia/Terrier mixes but there are likely a dozen more breeds mixed in. They get along wonderfully with the other dogs and have sweet, happy, dispositions. You will likely have some housetraining to do but it shouldn't take long as they seem eager to please and are smart little cookies. This is all we know so far and we will be learning as we go and so will you!\nUPDATE! We have discovered that Farley's tongue is constantly sticking out! What an adorable trait!\nThe Adoption Fee for this dog is $500.00\nAdoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a 'complete' pet. We accept CASH or Visa/Mastercard ONLY.\n\nJoyful Rescues has no funding except for our adoption fees and miscellaneous donations. Pet care and vet bills are expensive - you must be ready to take on this financial (as well as emotional) responsibility. YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 25 YEARS OF AGE TO ADOPT A DOG FROM JOYFUL RESCUES\n\nWe keep our pet list as up-to-date as possible. As soon as a pet is adopted, it is removed from the list. If a pet is still showing, it is still available for adoption.\n\nCan't Adopt Me? SPONSOR ME\nLook for the Link 'Special Instructions to Seller' if you want to note a particular pet\nBefore you seek to adopt a pet from Joyful Rescues, please read our Pet Adoption page http://www.joyfulrescues.org/pet_adoption.html.\n\nOnline Application",

            "description": "Happy Birthday Gary Groot!My siblings and I decided to sponsor this life saving transport to honor our father's 81st birthday. Our father, Gary Groot, is the main reason we are all animal lovers. We grew up watching and learning how to properly pamper our puppies and he instilled in us the importance of adoption; how it saves lives. My father just lost his beloved Precious who he loved with all his heart and took her everywhere, even bought a travel trailer so she could join him on mission projects for the church. Precious was by his side for the last 15 years and will now wait for him at the Rainbow Bridge. Suzanne, Karen & Tom\n\nPrecious and her 5 siblings were born around January 7, 2020, and may top out in the 60-65 pound range. Please understand we are truly guessing on the breed for this family. Some of the siblings have a more Retriever look while others we feel have more of a Collie appearance to them. They are wonderful with the other dogs and adore us, humans. It is likely they did not have much human interaction while growing up and so we anticipate you will have some basic training to do. They are sweet-natured, intelligent, teens, so training should go smoothly. This is all we know so far and we will be learning as we go and so will you.\nThe Adoption Fee for this dog is $500.00\nAdoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a 'complete' pet. We accept CASH or Visa/Mastercard ONLY.\n\nJoyful Rescues has no funding except for our adoption fees and miscellaneous donations. Pet care and vet bills are expensive - you must be ready to take on this financial (as well as emotional) responsibility. YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 25 YEARS OF AGE TO ADOPT A DOG FROM JOYFUL RESCUES\n\nWe keep our pet list as up-to-date as possible. As soon as a pet is adopted, it is removed from the list. If a pet is still showing, it is still available for adoption.\n\nCan't Adopt Me? SPONSOR ME\nLook for the Link 'Special Instructions to Seller' if you want to note a particular pet\nBefore you seek to adopt a pet from Joyful Rescues, please read our Pet Adoption page http://www.joyfulrescues.org/pet_adoption.html.\n\nOnline Application",

Herbie was surrendered to a high kill shelter in the south along with 11 other dogs from the same home. For breeds, we feel they are mostly Chia/Terrier mixes but there are likely a dozen more breeds mixed in. They get along wonderfully with the other dogs and have sweet, happy, dispositions. You will likely have some housetraining to do but it shouldn't take long as they seem eager to please and are smart little cookies. This is all we know so far and we will be learning as we go and so will you! Update from foster mom: Herbie is a doll!!! He is not noisy which we love and he is the HAPPIEST little guy! When he met his foster dad for the first time he about knocked himself over from his wagging tail. He is busy and fun when it is time and he is a true cuddler whenever you sit down. He adores his humans and although we've not had him around children I can't imagine a problem. What a wonderful little guy - SO glad we could save him.\nThe Adoption Fee for this dog is $500.00\nAdoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a 'complete' pet.

            "description": "In memory of Mike and Laura Bysiek.Sisters Jean (Mike) Gonska and Lorraine (Larry) Diggs, wanted to leave a lasting legacy in memory of their loving parents by establishing the Mike & Laura Bysiek Memorial Fund at the Cattaraugus Region Community Foundation to support a number of nonprofit organizations in the community each year.\nAs long-time active volunteers at Joyful Rescues and seeing the amazing, awe-inspiring, life-saving, tireless work that is done every day there, it was a wonderful option to be able to sponsor a life-saving pet transport annually in their honor.\nLola was born around January 7, 2019, and weighs about 40 pounds. Lola does well with the other dogs and rode well in the car on the long trip North. Lola has been an absolute pleasure to care for and keeps her living space very tidy! She is unassuming and eager to please. She craves our attention and would like to snuggle all day. This is all we know so far and we will be learning as we go and so will you! She came to us as a Border mix, but one of us feels strongly she is, or is very close to being, a pure Aussie.\nUPDATE: Lola does not have a tail! We don't know if she was born this way or someone decided to dock the tail. We are hoping she was born this way as tail docking is a barbaric practice and should be outlawed! We have found her to be a counter surfer and may submissive pee. This behavior is easy to curb as the dog becomes more self confident and if her humans react appropriately. There is a lot of information on line about this subject. One more thing we've discovered is she is mouthy with those she loves. We are teaching her 'no bite!' but she has a habit of putting her mouth on your hand, arm and even your elbow! She doesn't bite down, but her teeth are still on human skin which is inappropriate. So, we've told you as much bad as we've found and on the flip side she is not a big barker (which we love), she's simply gorgeous and soft, and extremely sweet and loving. Truly, if she'd have come in when I had a dog loss she might well be a keeper! A bit of a diamond in the rough, but I'm convinced a diamond will one day shine.\nThe Adoption Fee for this dog is $500.00\nAdoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a 'complete' pet. We accept CASH or Visa/Mastercard ONLY.\n\nJoyful Rescues has no funding except for our adoption fees and miscellaneous donations. Pet care and vet bills are expensive - you must be ready to take on this financial (as well as emotional) responsibility. YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 25 YEARS OF AGE TO ADOPT A DOG FROM JOYFUL RESCUES\n\nWe keep our pet list as up-to-date as possible. As soon as a pet is adopted, it is removed from the list. If a pet is still showing, it is still available for adoption.\n\nCan't Adopt Me? SPONSOR ME\nLook for the Link 'Special Instructions to Seller' if you want to note a particular pet\nBefore you seek to adopt a pet from Joyful Rescues, please read our Pet Adoption page http://www.joyfulrescues.org/pet_adoption.html.\n\nOnline Application",

            "description": "Happy Birthday Gary Groot!My siblings and I decided to sponsor this life saving transport to honor our father's 81st birthday. Our father, Gary Groot, is the main reason we are all animal lovers. We grew up watching and learning how to properly pamper our puppies and he instilled in us the importance of adoption; how it saves lives. My father just lost his beloved Precious who he loved with all his heart and took her everywhere, even bought a travel trailer so she could join him on mission projects for the church. Precious was by his side for the last 15 years and will now wait for him at the Rainbow Bridge. Suzanne, Karen & Tom\n\nRosie and her 5 siblings were born around January 7, 2020, and may top out in the 60-65 pound range. Please understand we are truly guessing on the breed for this family. Some of the siblings have a more Retriever look while others we feel have more of a Collie appearance to them. They are wonderful with the other dogs and adore us, humans. It is likely they did not have much human interaction while growing up and so we anticipate you will have some basic training to do. They are sweet-natured, intelligent, teens, so training should go smoothly. This is all we know so far and we will be learning as we go and so will you.\nThe Adoption Fee for this dog is $500.00\nAdoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a 'complete' pet.

We can't wait to see the other things she will learn in her new foster home!\n\nZoey LOVES to play fetch and will keep bringing her toys back to you to throw to her! Because of how active and energetic she is, we recommend older children at this time!\n\nIf interested in adopting or meeting Zoe, please fill out an application!!!\n\n*We do not adopt to Canada due to border restrictions and breed-specific legislation*\n\nAdoption donation includes Spay/Neuter, UTD on Vaccinations, deworming, and flea treatment.",

TXHH rescued him back in August from the streets and he was very malnourished and had severe skin issues. Now he is THRIVING. He's been with TXHH fosters to help gain his strength back and we know now that he is a very gentle dog, who loves getting scratches and cuddles. Some days he is very active, but others he just enjoys relaxing and sleeps the day away. He also can be very talkative and loves attention! He's not so much into toys, but he'll lay down to enjoy a delicious, yummy bone. Because he is a very gentle soul, he needs a calm and relaxing home. He loves his walks but barking dogs and loud noises can frighten him. Are you, or do you know, someone that could make his life complete? This survivor deserves the world. He's currently an office dog at TXHH Leander Adoption Center so drop by, ask a staff member to see him and pay this sweetie a visit!",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Danish is a beautiful lady who will melt your heart with her bushy tail wags and constant nuzzling for pets. Although a little skittish on first meeting new people and dogs, once she's established trust she is all affection.\n\nDanish is still adjusting to life inside and is working on perfecting her potty training so will require some patience and additional training as she learns. She is crate trained and is incredibly well behaved in her crate for down time and through the night. Danish should ideally go to a home where she does not need to be crated for more than a few hours a day - she has energy to burn and loves to be out and about with people.\n\nDanish tested incredibly well with the cat in Texas, but due to her alleged history of killing livestock, might proceed with a bit of caution. She does appear to be a bit reactive to other dogs on leashes who are pulling towards her or barking at all and will require slow and patient introductions to other dogs. As you can see from the video, she has already established trust with our resident dog and is getting more and more comfortable and playful with him by the day. She definitely likes to be dominant so would do well with lower energy dogs who are willing to be submissive. When she's wound up, she really loves to play! With the right match, I think Danish could thrive in a home with another dog.\n\nThis girl is a looker with a great personality who just needs someone with the patience and experience to help her ease into her new comfortable indoor lifestyle.\n\nDanish has had at least one litter of puppies in her past but is now spayed. She will need heartworm treatment upon adoption which will require lots of rest but is very manageable.\n\nDanish was surrendered to a high kill shelter in Texas for allegedly killing livestock.If you are an approved adopter and are interested in this dog, please let your case worker know. If you are not yet an approved adopter but are interested, please complete an adoption application!\nYou can review our adoption process, www.shenandoahrescue.org/adoption-process if interested. Donations can be made at shenandoahrescue.org/donate or on PayPal to info@shenandoahrescue.org",

I really enjoy checking everything out, running around the yard, and playing with my toys! While I'm the farthest thing from a picky eater, because I love love love food, I am selective about the kind of doggies I get along with. However, I do seem to like them more if they're calm, mellow, and easy going. I'm good on walks and would do great with an active family! If I sound like the puppers for you, please click on the \"Ask about Jennifer\" button below my picture, because I'd love to meet you too!\n\nSincerely\nJennifer Primary Color: White Weight: 56.6lbs Age: 2yrs 5mths 2wks Animal has been Spayed",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Danish is a beautiful lady who will melt your heart with her bushy tail wags and constant nuzzling for pets. Although a little skittish on first meeting new people and dogs, once she's established trust she is all affection.\n\nDanish is still adjusting to life inside and is working on perfecting her potty training so will require some patience and additional training as she learns. She is crate trained and is incredibly well behaved in her crate for down time and through the night. Danish should ideally go to a home where she does not need to be crated for more than a few hours a day - she has energy to burn and loves to be out and about with people.\n\nDanish tested incredibly well with the cat in Texas, but due to her alleged history of killing livestock, might proceed with a bit of caution. She does appear to be a bit reactive to other dogs on leashes who are pulling towards her or barking at all and will require slow and patient introductions to other dogs. As you can see from the video, she has already established trust with our resident dog and is getting more and more comfortable and playful with him by the day. She definitely likes to be dominant so would do well with lower energy dogs who are willing to be submissive. When she's wound up, she really loves to play! With the right match, I think Danish could thrive in a home with another dog.\n\nThis girl is a looker with a great personality who just needs someone with the patience and experience to help her ease into her new comfortable indoor lifestyle.\n\nDanish has had at least one litter of puppies in her past but is now spayed. She will need heartworm treatment upon adoption which will require lots of rest but is very manageable.\n\nDanish was surrendered to a high kill shelter in Texas for allegedly killing livestock.If you are an approved adopter and are interested in this dog, please let your case worker know. If you are not yet an approved adopter but are interested, please complete an adoption application!\nYou can review our adoption process, www.shenandoahrescue.org/adoption-process if interested.

I really enjoy checking everything out, running around the yard, and playing with my toys! While I'm the farthest thing from a picky eater, because I love love love food, I am selective about the kind of doggies I get along with. However, I do seem to like them more if they're calm, mellow, and easy going. I'm good on walks and would do great with an active family! If I sound like the puppers for you, please click on the \"Ask about Jennifer\" button below my picture, because I'd love to meet you too!\n\nSincerely\nJennifer Primary Color: White Weight: 56.6lbs Age: 2yrs 5mths 2wks Animal has been Spayed",

She still has those puppy eyes and it can get really difficult to say no to giving her treats, which she takes gently. She is very well-behaved and easy to walk. Millie only prefers the company of male dogs, so a meet and greet is recommended for any dog in the house. Millie is very relaxed in the home but she also loves to play! She just wants to get pets from everybody including kids! She is also house trained and loves to sleep on couch. Millie's adoption fee is FREE in honor of the Lugo Family!",

            "description": "STAR is a foster-based rescue. All our rescue animals stay in foster homes until adoption. We do not have a central facility. If you want to meet any of our adoptables please submit an application.\n\nHi! My name is Blueberry! I'm a happy and playful puppy! I was part of an unwanted litter and found myself at animal control but a nice foster lady got me out of doggie jail because a shelter is no place for a pup like me! I am now on the hunt for my forever family. I love everyone I meet and I love playing with toys and chewing on bones. If you are interested in meeting me, please fill out an application. Thank you! My adoption fee is $350 ($50 is refundable when I am neutered)I come up to date on my vaccinations, microchipped, on flea/tick/worm prevention medication and I also will come with some food, treats, toys, leash and collar. If you are interested in meeting me, please fill out an application ASAP. www.savingtailsanimalrescue.org\n\nAll STAR animals come vetted, Up to Date (UTD) on age appropriate shots and testing, spay and neutered (if of age,) and microchipped.\n\nAGE DISCLAIMER:\nUnfortunately, most of the orphaned animals that come into our rescue looking for homes don't bring birth certificates. Sometimes we know our pets' ages. Sometimes we don't. So we make our best guess based on the condition of their teeth and the veterinarians best guess.\nBREED DISCLAIMER:\nVisual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality,\nnot\nby breed label .\nMicrochips:\nFor the safety of our dogs and peace of mind of our fosters and adopters, STAR microchips all dogs prior to adoption with Petlink Microchips. Please understand that all dogs MUST still wear a collar with ID tags (which include your current information) AT ALL TIMES. Please remember, our foster dogs are extremely important to us-- we will always take any of our dogs back, if for any reason you can't keep your adopted dog. Never surrender him/her to a shelter!",

We don't know - I could even have hound in me.  Does it matter? I need a new family that will commit to me no matter what breed I am!  \n\nI am about 35 lbs and I love to play with my canine foster brother, Enso!  He is a pittie mix and so I am able to chase him like a crazy woman.  I describe my play style as high energy, run-until-you-drop, GO!  My ideal canine friends should be okay with that.  My foster family has human kids and they\u2019re great!  I love to snuggle and am very affectionate. \n\nIf you'd like to put in an application for me, contact Debby at djg4517@gmail.com\n",

            "description": "Meet Dunn! He is approx. 10 months old and 12 lbs. Dunn was rescued from a hoarding situation with many other dogs. He is still learning how to adjust to his new surroundings and having people around him all the time! Despite arriving with a broken leg, he has made huge strides in just a few weeks with his foster. Dunn bonds with his main caregiver quicker than other members in the house. He does not like when the children in the home run through or make loud noises so for this reason we're requiring an adult-only home. He's currently fostered with dogs of all sizes and after proper introductions, he does very well with them. Dunn loves to play with the younger dogs in the house. He would be really happy in a home that has another playmate for him! With a dedicating adopter and time to decompress, Dunn is an amazing and loving little guy that deserves the best after such a rough start in life! \n\nDue to his current training plan, applicants without a yard are currently not being considered for Dunn. \n\nThis animal is currently being foster in New Jersey and will require potential adopters to go there for a meet and greet or adoption.\n\nThis animal's adoption fee is $300",

Cooper is a super sweet, gentle guy that is looking for his new family. Despite his large size, he walks well on a leash and has such good manners. Cooper would love to find a home with a comfortable bed, lots of treats, and some new humans to take him on walks and adventures. He appears to be house trained and would love to bust out of our shelter soon! Cooper prefers to be your one and only fur baby in the home. Apply to meet this sweetie today!\n\nIf you're interested in meeting or adopting Cooper, please complete an application at: inapl.org/adoption-application. Once it's processed, a member of our team will be in touch with you to schedule a meet and greet appointment.

Jackie (left) and Kelso (right) arrived at The Animal Protection League after spending a month all alone when their owner passed away. They were heartbroken and afraid to be in a shelter after losing both their family and their home. With the help of our dedicated staff and volunteers, Jackie and Kelso have come out of their shells and their pleasant personalities truly shine. Jackie (female) is 4 years old and Kelso (male) is 5. They're active, playful, and tons of fun! They previously lived with both cats and dogs, so we expect them to do well in a pet friendly home. Jackie and Kelso have not spent much time with children, but they're friendly and social and would likely enjoy the company of respectful kiddos. We'd love to keep this dynamic duo together. Do you have room in your heart and home for Jackie and Kelso? \n\nIf you're interested in adopting Jackie and Kelso, please complete an application at: inapl.org/adoption-application. Applications are not necessarily on a first come, first served basis. Our team will make adoption decisions based on the best fit for the dynamic duo. We expect Jackie and Kelo to be a popular pups, so any questions can be directed at adopt@inapl.org vs. calling the shelter. Their combined adoption fee is $250 and includes spay/neuter, vaccinations, microchip, dewormer, 30 days of pet health insurance, and a free wellness exam.\n\nJackie & Kelso\nJack Russell/Pug mixes\nJackie DOB: 1/16/2017\nKelso DOB: 1/16/2016\nHeartworm Negative",

So far he's been good with her daughter. He has another dog bed close to her desk in her office, so that he can sit near her during the day. He will scratch at her legs when he wants to sit in her lap. She has built him a makeshift steps off her one-step back porch to help him get to the ground. He does have a few bursts of energy where he likes to play with his small soft toys! He is a little hard of hearing, and his vision isn't what it used to be! He is a 13-year-old Shih Tzu. He currently weighs 20 pounds, but he is on a diet to get some weight off of him. He is doing better on going potty outside, but his new family will need to continue working with him!!\nAdoption application at https://www.shelteranimalsrescue.org/adoption.shtmlVisit the SARG, Inc. website for more information about our policies, events, and to submit an online application for one of our animals: https://www.shelteranimalsrescue.org.",

When you look into my big soulful eyes you'll see the most loyal and loving dog. I will need some time to adjust to my new home but once I do I will be at your side forever. I still get a little nervous when I can't see my pack but I'm working on it. I am highly treat motivated and have learned \"sit\", \"paw\", making progress on \"down\", \"stay\" and \"come\". My fosters say I'm very smart and a fast learner. I LOVE other dogs, and would love to have a doggy friend in my new home. I would love a friend big enough for me to wrestle (I love wrestling) but I respect other dogs' boundaries if they don't want to play. Other than playing with dogs I love chewing on consumable toys and stuffed animals. I walk well on a leash and have learned to love car rides. I am working on potty training and do best when I have a quiet, private (other dogs are ok) space outside. So my fosters think a fenced in yard would be the best for me. I like hanging out in my crate but sleep under/in my fosters' bed right now. I love to end the day with snuggles on the couch. I have a lot of love to give and I'm excited to find a family I can love with all my heart forever.",

            "description": "Hi! I\u2019m Beans, formerly known as Diamond but not completely attached to any name so open to suggestions:) I have a bit of a long story. A nice lady rescued me from an abusive situation and convinced my former owner to give me up so I could have a chance for a happy life. She REALLY REALLY wanted to keep me but there were some personality conflicts with her fur kids so I find myself here looking for my forever home. I am an 8 year old pitbull/American bulldog mix and I have SO much love to give. I know lots of tricks - sit, stay, down, and high five. I am house broken and crate trained and can hold it for up to 9 hours (but prefer to go frolic outside a little more often than that). I am a pretty low maintenance/low energy dog - I love just laying around and sleeping all day and I have the cutest little snore. I particularly like lounging on couches but am really good at getting off the furniture when I am told. I also come with my very own awesome dog bed which I LOVE. I like giving kisses but don\u2019t require a ton of attention and am fine entertaining myself if you have work to do or can\u2019t play with me. I love people so so so much!!! Now that we got some of the good stuff out of the way, here\u2019s the rest. I would probably do best in a home where I would be an only pet. I have some problems with guarding food and toys and would really prefer not to share these with any other animals. I do well playing with dogs outside but I do not want to live with them or have them around my stuff. That being said, I\u2019m ok if my human touches me while I am eating or playing. They don\u2019t think I have lived with kids but play well with the older neighbors when they are outside (ages 9 and 12). I have not been around or tested with younger children. I am also not a huge fan of cats. I used to pull on the leash but this lady bought me a front clip harness so now am much better but she would say I am a work in progress when it comes to taking walks - I start off fast but tire out pretty quickly. I am allowed to roam around the whole upstairs when my current host leaves for work and have not gotten into or chewed up ANYTHING. I am a really good girl when it comes to that. As I said, I generally just sleep all day. I am a bit overweight and will need to lose a few pounds. They thought I might have arthritis but the Vet said I am just fat and once the extra weight comes off, I\u2019ll move even better. Last thing, I am prone to chronic ear infections. My last owner didn\u2019t take very good care of me and did not address this problem so I have a lot of scarring in my ear canals which is what is leading to the infections. The good news is they are looking really good now thanks to my medicine. I am up to date on all my vaccines as of November. Anyone out there looking for someone like me? I am low energy and promise to love you with all my heart if you give me a chance.",

            "description": "Adoptable Georgia is a sweet approximately 6 year old pittie. She loves people but seems to prefer adults, teenagers stress her out a bit, and would do best in an all adult home. Georgia has seen a veterinary behaviorist for anxiety. Noises (noises occurring outside when she is inside - ie. car or truck noises, construction work noise, fireworks, storms) and boundaries (people outside while she is inside) are issues for Georgia. The veterinarian has prescribed medication to Georgia to help with her anxiety. She happily takes her medication. She comes running when she hears a pill bottle being opened because she knows she is about to get a tasty treat. The medication helps her to be a happier, calmer dog. Georgia is not crate trained. She would likely hurt herself trying to get out of a crate. She has free range in her current home and has never been destructive. She loves attention and being with people. She will sit on your feet or on your lap if able. She likes chin scratches, belly rubs, butt scratches, and snuggling on the couch. She enjoys playing with sturdy stuffed toys (otherwise they don't last long), tug, running after a ball, and rolling in the grass or on a carpet. She also loves a sunny spot, either inside or outside. Georgia loves fruits and vegetables. Some of her favorites are fresh red bell pepper and cucumber as well as frozen blackberries. Georgia travels well in a car. She does not seem to like colder weather but does like a sweater on a chilly day.\n\nGeorgia would do best with a fenced yard to run around in. She has weekly zoomies that are usually short bursts. While she does enjoy going on walks, she is very reactive to other dogs on leash, whether she sees them or just hears them, which can make walking her very challenging. Georgia has had limited experience with other dogs off leash. She would do best as an only dog in the home, who does not have interactions with other dogs.\n\nGeorgia is a smart girl who is highly treat motivated. She has solved all the dog puzzles she has been given, purchased or homemade. She knows sit, down, wait, shake, high five, watch me, touch (nose to palm), fist bump (nose to fist), bed (go to), hungry (runs to where her food is kept), and go to place (working on duration). She sits nicely until being told \"okay\" before eating. She has also learned a positive interrupter signal which helps to distract or redirect her from noises she finds scary. Georgia's reaction when a visitor comes to the door is challenging and a work in progress.",

If you have additional questions about this dog, please call the shelter at 614-879-8368 or contact us through our website!\n\nKodiak is a ~3-year-old, 56 lb shepherd who arrived at the shelter on 1/14/21 as a stray.  Kodiak loves to play with toys, especially tennis balls and anything that squeaks and even knows how to fetch! He is a very happy outgoing guy once he gets comfortable with where he's at and the people around him.\nWith other dogs he can be overly playful and a little rude, so he may become too overwhelming for other playmates. With cats we are not sure how he'd respond as he is super active and ready to play, and chase, so a home without cats would probably be best for him. Since he is such a sweet young boy with energy to spend, a home without smaller children would probably be best. Kodiak seems so be crate trained and understand some basic commands. Kodiak is a great dog ready for his forever home!\n\nOur adoption fees vary, Shelter Dogs are $150, Prison Dogs are $200, Puppies are $250, and Popular Pure-Breeds are $400. The price includes: a Home Again Microchip, set of shots, de-worming, heartworm testing (if old enough), spay or neuter, and a 1 year rabies shot (if old enough). All dogs adopted must leave with a county license at an additional cost of $17, this fee is cash only. Adoption fees can be done using credit card or cash.  If you are interested in this dog, please call the shelter at 614-879-8368 or fill out an online application at www.hsmcohio.org",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.DOG LOCATION: Ajax, ON. Meet Benson. He is a 3 1/2 year old poodle mix who is just as cute as can be! Who wouldn't love that face?!\n\nBenson weighs approximately 67 lbs and, well, he could stand to lose some weight. About 15-17lbs! It's a strict diet for this boy. Thankfully he is taking it well and doesn't beg for food, though food left out at his level is fair game.\n\nThis extra weight is really not good for Benson because he has some issues with his hips and it would be better for him if he was fit and trim. This will be the goal for his new family.\n\nBenson has a tendency to want to guard the things he loves so he's learning to trade and so far he thinks this is a good game. We'll want his training to continue so he knows it's fun to share but because of this issue we do not recommend him in a home where there are children under the age of 16.\n\nAs a young dog Benson had a few meetings with dogs that didn't go well so Benson is unsure of other dogs. He'll need a home of his own, without other dogs or cats.\n\nPlease note Benson is not suited to apartment or townhouse living and he sheds so is not suitable for families who have allergies.\n\nIf you are interested in Benson, Please email us to start the conversation.",

He was abused by a man in his past life, and doesn't do well with men, so he needs to go to a home with woman only. Someone stepped up to help Simba, but they couldn't keep him, that's why he came to the shelter. He lived in a home with another dog and children of all ages. He would do best in a home with a fenced yard. If you think Simba is a fit for your family, fill out the online application and call the shelter at 609-265-5073 ext. 4 to schedule a meet!",

He\u2019s intelligent, ready to learn and would enjoy interacting with an active family/owner. An owner who understands the characteristics of the coonhound breed, and a home without cats, would be best. Conrad definitely needs activities and exercise to keep him happy physically and mentally.\n\n\nAll animals are spayed/neutered and up to date on vaccinations before going home!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting me or want further information, please fill out an on-line application at ochumane.org.  Due to COVID-19 we will only be contacting people with an approved application for followup information and to schedule a meet and greet by telephone.   We will not be at PetSmart Avon on Saturdays until further notice.  Thanks so much for your interest.  \n",

Nice to meet ya!  \n\nWATCH MY VIDEO:  https://youtu.be/C6OmmW1qWzY\n\nhttps://youtu.be/7j6NvJyryLo\n\nA nice person came along and took me in and, now, I am ready to hit the road to your house!  Uh, make that \u201cour\u201d house, OK?  I definitely need a house with a fenced-in yard cuz I need room to run and romp and be safe!  The rescue requires (1) a fenced-in yard and (2) a vet reference from a vet that you have used for a current or previous dog to be sure that all vetting was done and (3) a comparable-sized doggie sibling)  \n\nI am a Retriever/Staffy mix.  I am 10 MONTHS old and I weigh 55-60 pounds. I have been neutered and am up to date on vaccines so I'm ready to go to my new home with YOU!!  Those funny-looking 2-legged creatures said I\u2019m also microchipped \u2013 whatever THAT is.  At any rate, I am fully vetted.  Is that anything close to petted?  I love to be petted!  They say I'm precious.  Hmmm, Is my name Milo or Precious?\n\nWanna hear some more good stuff about me?  OK, here goes.  I like ALL people and ALL dogs.  I need to have a DOGGIE SIBLING about my size so we can run and romp together and burn up LOTS and LOTS of energy!   I know basic commands.  I respond very well to consistent, positive reinforcement training and I'm a good learner!  Smart, huh?\n\nI am attentive, affectionate, silly, playful and loyal.  I LOVE cuddles, car rides, holding hands and tummy rubs.  I am a beta doggie.  I back down when prompted by aggressive dogs. I'm an amazing companion!\n\nI have lots to learn.  Will you teach me all the things a pup needs to know to be safe and happy? I LOVE to give kisses so get ready!  \n\nIf you have children, then need to be older children - 12 and up because I like to play hard and run fast!  It's fun!\n\nI like to take naps when I'm tired from playing.  I need  love, exercise and couch-sitting when we get tired!  Let's be a team, OK?\n\nIf you would like to take me home (and you know you do), please email rescuedogsgalore@gmail.com  and they can get me on my way to a new and loving home!  My adoption fee is $150 and includes my vetting, neutering, and a microchip.\n\n",

I am very sweet and loving with people, but I am usually not a fan of other dogs and would prefer to be the only dog in the home. I love to go for nice long-leashed walks and would be just ecstatic to finally find myself a home where I could have my very own yard to run around and play in. I do have a lot of energy for my age and would not make a very good apartment dog. I would be happiest living in an adult-only home and do have a decent prey drive and should be kept away from cats and other small animals. I am house-broken and crate trained already! I can be protective of my food, treats, and toys. I am normally a very mellow pup but can be a little aggressive at times if provoked. I would really benefit from an experienced dog owner who can help me work through the fearfulness that prompts my negative behaviors and learn to cope with it appropriately.",

The kind folks here at MaxFund have been working with me on basic commands. So far, I have mastered how to sit, and I am very polite on walks! \n\nWhile I am a friendly little girl, I can be a little unsure of some dogs. The best way to go about making new friends, would be with slow introductions once I get used to being your forever companion. I am potty trained, but please be patient with me while I adjust to a new home. If you think we could be best friends forever, call MaxFund (303-595-4917) to set up an appointment to come play with me!\n\nMaxFund is a physical shelter located at 1005 Galapago St in Denver, Colorado.\nIf you are interested in learning more about a dog, please call 303-595-4917 to make an appointment to meet a dog\n\nThis PetFinder account is managed by volunteers, and the most up-to-date information is at the shelter.\nHow our adoption process works:\n1. You MUST come into the shelter to meet a dog you are interested in (and meet a few others, while you\u2019re at it!)\n               \n                Our hours are 10-5 Mon, Wed, Thu Fri / 11-5 Saturday / 12-5 Sunday\n                We suggest you call ahead to be sure the dog(s) do not have pending applications\n2. You will fill out your adoption application, including references, after finding a dog you\u2019d like to adopt\n3. The application review and reference checks will take up to 3-5 business days; you will not be able to bring a dog home same-day\n                We only take 2 applications per dog, before they are unavailable. This is why we suggest you call ahead to check the status of the pup!\n \nWe do not adopt out-of-state.\nThank you for choosing to rescue!",

Fortunately, Chloe has landed in an amazing foster home with a family that is doting on her. As the pictures show, Chloe is putting on a brave face during this new venture, and doing her best to keep the children occupied.\n\nChloe does fine with her scrappy foster dog brother, and loves the attention from the children. She is calm and quiet, fully housebroken, and walks beautifully on a leash.\n\nChloe is 6 years old and weighs about 60 lb. She is spayed, microchipped, dewormed, and up to date on vaccines.  She did test positive for heartworms, and will need to be kept quiet and on cage rest for six weeks after receiving the infusion therapy.\n\nChloe's adoption fees $300 cash and she is eligible for foster-to-adopt .  For more information on Chloe and an adoption application, please email UnderdogRailway@yahoo.com\n\n** we take pandemic safety very seriously. All meet and greets will be conducted outdoors, following appropriate masking and distancing protocols**",

It seems that she hasn\u2019t had many experiences with Cats and/or Dogs. She is very friendly and active. She is good with children and I think with time will be good with other animals.

After spending almost 6 weeks in the shelter with 3 missed adoption appointments by his previous owner and 3 missed appointments by potential adopters he is now with us.  Terk is very good with other dogs and warms up to people in just a short time.  Terk would do best in a home without young children because he can be a little nippy in play.  He is very puppy for his age and would love to have a playmate, it could be another dog or a slightly older child.  He is 100% house trained and crate trained.  He is fully vaccinated, microchipped, and neutered.",

He is a bird dog about 40 lbs. He is a sweet old fellow who has never gotten to live inside. He has some arthritis in his front shoulder and the cold concrete floor up in the mountains makes mornings rough for him. I tried to take him in but it turns out he cannot be in a home with a cat, though he has gotten along well with my other dogs. He is going to have to return to the shelter as I have 2 cats in danger and cannot keep them separated long term. Mister is from Appalachian Animal Rescue Center in Franklin, NC. We have a very limited number of fosters here in my area and most of them have cats. Mister is very social with other dogs. He did well with mine and pleasant with other dogs passed when out walking. I will send the video and pictures. Any help would be greatly appreciated for this very kindly older gentleman.",

Rusty , like most border collies, loves people but is shy when he first meets them.\u00a0 \u00a0He is a play ball all day kind of boy.\u00a0 If he can find a tennis ball, he'll put it in your hands or in your lap to encourage you to throw it so he can bring it right back to you.\n\nHe is gentle but unnerved by small kids so a home with older children or no children is important.\n\nRusty is good with other dogs but unknown how he is with cats.\n\nRusty is neutered, up to date on shots and on heartworm prevention. He is housebroken and well behaved inside but is hesitant to enter a room where a ceiling fan is running.\u00a0 We expect he'll outgrow this in time.\n\n\u00a0If you are interested in Rusty, please complete an online application at www.bordercollierescuewesttn.org or email us with questions at\u00a0contact@bordercollierescuewesttn.org.\n\nAs with all of our dogs, we will require a fully fenced yard and excellent vet references.\n\nRusty's adoption fee is $300.\u00a0 He is located in the Memphis area.",

We do our best to provide information that will help determine if the dog might be a good fit for you. Please note that behaviors may change in a home environment. We also ask our applicants to assume that any animal they adopt from us will need to be potty trained and learn house manners, although this is not always the case. Our online animal bios are designed to provide as much information as possible and answer some anticipated questions. We do not have the resources to respond to emails with more specific questions.\n\nWe are receiving an unusually high number of applications per pet at this time! Please follow the rules below to ensure your application is reviewed; pay attention closely to these instructions because applications will NOT be processed if they are not followed. Please keep in mind that dog/cat availability is currently changing by the hour; you will receive an email if the animal you are interested in is no longer available. New dogs become available almost every day, so feel free to let us know if someone else interests you if your initial choice is already adopted! \n\nFill out the application (DOG: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IHD-DOG-Application-9-10-18.pdf, CAT: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IHD-CAT-Application.pdf) completely. Every question must be answered, and it must be signed. If you are going to type your responses, open the application, save it, type your answers, and save it again. \n\n-Applicants must be 21+ years old and live within a 50-mile radius of our shelter at 22415 Groesbeck Hwy, Warren 48089.\n\n-You must identify at least 1 dog/cat that you are interested in. If there are multiple dogs/cats, number them in order of priority. \n\n-Scan a copy of proof of home ownership (i.e. tax bill, deed, or mortgage payment - you can black out the account #, etc.) or animal clause/agreement of your rental agreement.\n\n-Attach the application and home ownership proof/rental agreement animal clause to a new email and send it to bark@iheartdogs.org. The subject line must be formatted to read \"\"#1 choice of dog/cat, Your First and Last Name\"\". Example: Subject: Fido, Jane Doe\nOnce your application is received, it will be assigned to an Adoption Counselor who will follow-up with the applicant who is the best fit within a few days, or to discuss other dogs/cats. It could take up to a couple of weeks for you to receive a final disposition on your application so there is no need to check on the status.\n\n-Introductions will be scheduled by appointment only, 45 minutes per appointment. The entire household, including current dogs, must be present for the appointment. The introductions will take place outside in our parking lot.\n\n-We will continue to perform vet checks for current and prior pets in the household.\n\n-Home visits will be in person for the yard and virtual for inside the home.\n\n-Finalizing the adoption will also be scheduled by appointment.\n\nWhile this process may seem cumbersome, it is interim during COVID-19, and it is designed to help us respond to the volume of emails we receive every day. Since we are receiving a high volume of applications, please be patient if a dog/cat is no longer available. \n\nThank you for your understanding.",

He is going to need some very special people who are willing to give him the time and space he needs to feel confident in a new home. Ongoing structure and routine are a must for him. Murphy has lots of silly boxer energy which he needs to burn up.  He loves going for walks and hiking, he's playful and goofy. He is generally happy to greet strangers with that crazy boxer wiggle butt. He has lived with other submissive dogs and a few cats. He's a snuggler when it's on his own terms. He just happens to guard his food but not toys. He's quite an amazing character and deserves someone who will love all of him, including his quirkiness. We are looking for an experienced handler without children. \n\nIf you feel Murphy is a good fit for your home, please submit an adoption application at www.almosthomeri.org",

Karma is pure love - so affectionate and trusting from the moment we pet her. She is a warm and friendly girl with a fantastic temperament. She was easy to walk on the leash and extremely well-behaved. Just saying her name was met by her full attention and eagerness to please no matter what distractions were nearby. She was a great companion who kept up with our pace from a slow stroll to a jog. When she saw other dogs she showed interest but didn't pull hard on the leash or make a sound. She was happy to get affection from everyone who approached her and always received some variant of \"What a gorgeous, happy dog you are!\" A highlight of our time together was sitting outside at a local brewery where she just layed down under the table, people watched, and seemed like the most content pup in the world. She is super mellow with positive energy and I couldn't stop looking into her gorgeous, soulful eyes. Her name is just perfect for her. Go see and experience her for yourself.\n\nKarma was dumped in a rural area where someone found her. The woman who found her could not keep her as she was moving so she brought her to us at PRBJ. Karma came to us in a rough condition and we are working hard to get her healthy and looking great. She loves attention and affection and knows basic commands such as \"sit\". She loves people but has challanges with other dogs so she should be the only dog in the home. Karma is a great girl looking for her chance at a forever home. Please fill out an application to meet her and see for yourself how wonderful she can be.",

He is a sweet guy, but is not fond of little kids, which is why he was surrendered, so no kids for this guy. He loves consistency and has made great improvements over the past few months, since he has been able to get consistent exercise. He loves belly rubs and playing fetch in the yard. He is learning how to drop the tennis ball, and he is very treat motivated, and a fast learner. His previous owner stated he lived in a home with another dog, but due to high dog reactivity in the shelter, we are uncertain how he would do with other dogs, so a dog meet is a must. If you think Alfie is a fit for your home, fill out an application and give the shelter a call to schedule a meet.",

Toro has her moments of playful energy and excitement but for the most part, she's a pretty calm gal. She generally likes spending her time curled up with her favorite people, taking a relaxing stroll through the park or just roaming about. With her canine friends, Toro likes to have calm and polite friends like her to roam the yard with. If Toro sounds like the cuddle buddy for you, come on by and spend some time with her today!\n\nI am currently in foster! If you are interested in meeting with me, please email my foster coordinator Abby at fostercoor@mckameyanimalcenter.org!

Men are especially scary for me so please be gentle and slow with me.  I promise when I know I'm safe I will become your bestest boy ever.  I love my people hard so it will be worth it.  I'm a happy go lucky guy who gets along great with other dogs, so if you have a pooch pal already, that's fine by me!\n\nAll of The Right to Live dogs are fostered locally in San Antonio Texas and will be transported to other states to their new families upon adoption. We believe fostering dogs and not having them decompress in a kenneled environment is more beneficial for the dogs and builds their trust and companionship in a family situation. Adoption fee includes transportation costs, previous/current medical treatment (spay/neuter, etc.) and a health certificate for cross-state travel",

            "description": "Peanut is a stunning young boy with the most expressive eyes. He is 12 months old and 18 pounds. He is a sweet boy that gets along with everyone in his foster home - kids, adults, cats and his foster dog sister who he loves to play with. He is an easy going boy that is potty trained and has been given the full run of the house without any issues. He is sweet and loving and likes to be near his people and foster fur sibling. He has some big ears and clearly hears very well and every single time he hears something he will let you know.  Hopefully you will love the sound of his voice as much as he does, lol.  He is recovering from hip surgery and going forward to continue his rehab, he needs a home where he can get exercise throughout the day.  A fenced in yard is a MUST so that he can run multiple times a day. Staying active on his legs is important for his continued recovery.  He has lots of energy, so an active family that can take him out and about and go on walks or hikes would be great!  Having another doggy friend to play with would also be ideal. Peanut is excited to find his forever family, and paws crossed, maybe another fur sibling.  \n\nAre you interested in adopting Peanut or another JCAPL pet you have seen? You'll need to start by completing an adoption application, available online at our website: www.jcapl.org. There is no obligation to adopt by completing an application, however, we do recommend submitting an application as soon as you find an animal you are interested in. We review applications in the order they are received.\n\nCompleted applications can be sent via email to adopt@jcapl.org , faxed to 919-300-5524 or delivered in person by visiting us at one of our adoption events on Saturdays at PetSmart in Garner (White Oak Shopping Center). \n\nWe will contact you as soon as possible once we receive your application.\n\nThanks for thinking adoption!",

Due to the scars on some of the others and the fact that her teeth are partially filed down the vet thinks she may have been used as a bait dog. Despite her past she does not let that hold her back from showing everyone she meets how loving she is.

I am great on the leash so I hope you have plans for lots of activity with me.  I do get a little over excited sometimes and jump up but I am working on my \"four on the floor\" - can you help me with that? I would probably be best in a home with older kids so I don't knock anyone over by accident with my zest for life!  \n\nAll of The Right to Live dogs are fostered locally in San Antonio Texas and will be transported to other states to their new families upon adoption. We believe fostering dogs and not having them decompress in a kenneled environment is more beneficial for the dogs and builds their trust and companionship in a family situation.

I did have some misfortunes in my previous life and lost one of my legs and my health was very neglected.  Thanks to all of my adoring fans, I'm all fixed up and feeling the best that I ever have!\nMy personal veterinarian thinks that I'm 10-12 years old.\nAll I'm really looking for is a nice, soft, cushy bed so I can sit quietly and just be near my humans.\nOne of my favorite things to do is soak up some sun, whether it's in the house or outside.  \nI'm working on getting accustomed to my wheelchair and my foster mom told me that I get to take that to my forever home too.  \nMy adoption donation is $250.00 because the rescue that I work with, R&R Sanctuary, Inc., has a special program for dogs just like me.  \nOrange County, CA\nR&R Sanctuary, Inc.\nPaypal:  joymanley@MAQS.net",

If you would like to give him a loving home, please complete an application.\n\nLaredo is located in Texas and is available for adoption and transport to Castle Rock, CO on Feb. 13th. He is neutered, up to date on all shots, microchipped and his adoption fee is $375. The fee includes the transport cost.

Carrie can be reached at fedwellfarm@yahoo.com, or 602-316-8919 No texts please\n\n Ginny is a super sweet girl that was booted from  her home when a small child startled her and bit and so Ginny after 5 years living with her family was at the county shelter.\n\nGinny is sweet, she loves her people.\n\nShe takes a little while to develop trust, but she comes around.  She has been through so much.\n\nAt the shelter she was the employee favorite, spending time in their office greeting visitors during the day.  Doesn't sound very dangerous to me!\n\nPlease come meet Ginny.  She will be a great dog for someone that works or goes to school.  She is content to watch Animal Planet while you are away but will love walks and play time afterward.  She could easily be an apartment dog.\n\nWhile greyhounds love to run, but they are not highly energetic during the day and Ginny being 5, she is happy just to have a safe and wonderful human that comes home to her.\n\nPlease come meet Ginny so she can have the life she should always have had.\n\n602-316-8919 (no texts please)\n\n",

            "description": "Milo is very fond of people and their soft sofas! He will gladly chill with you and watch TV or let you do your thing while he naps. He loves walks and is not a puller. Milo was found as a stray and has struggled to find a good fit in a foster. He is too interested in cats and gets bored alone in the yard, but we don't want him to be a yard dog anyway. He gets along with other dogs and loves all humans! He can be trusted in your home alone and does not need to be crated unless only for short periods. He is a young fellow and should have a loving family of his own! He has heartworm disease but the rescue will provide his medication until he tests negative. Because we are foster based, we require an approved application before a meet and greet can be scheduled. We think that is fair for our fosters so every meet and greet has the potential to result in an immediate adoption. The application is available on the rescue website and can be completed online.We work with many rescues and strive to find every rescued dog in our care a great home. Sometimes that means transferring that pet to another location where adoption may be more likely. We currently have partners in New York, Pennsylvania, and Vermont.\n\nIf you are interesting in meeting any of our pets, the process is to complete an application. It can be downloaded as a pdf document from our website and submitted by email to WindyRidgeRescue@gmail.com as a scanned document or as photos OR can be completed entirely online. Both links are in the header of our website.\n\nBecause we are foster based, we require an approved application to schedule a meet and greet. We feel that is fair to our fosters and rescues so every meet and greet can result in an adoption.\n\nWe do not have set adoption fees for dogs, but hope adopters will donate generously so we can rescue more. The medical care for every dog can easily exceed the adoption donation. Average adoption fees for dogs in the area range from $175 up to $450.\n\nWe ask for a minimum adoption donation of $50 for cats regardless of age. Each cat is up to date on vaccinations, dewormer, and microchipped. Larger donations are always welcome so we can rescue more. Medical care for each cat easily exceeds the minimum donation.\n\nAs with every rescue, our resources are limited and the need for rescue help is unlimited. Your generosity helps us to rescue more.\n\nAdopting or fostering for a rescue frees up a space where a new rescue can reside.\n\nIf you can't adopt or foster, than please consider donating.",

            "description": "Maddie was apparently wandering on her own after having a litter of puppies not long ago. A pup friend found her and brought her home to the family house for a bath, a meal, and some tender loving care, and most importantly, a chance for a family of her own. Maddie seems comfortable in the home and likes to be a follower so she doesn't miss any pets or treats. She loves doggie toys and collects them on her bed for safekeeping. She is happy to snuggle with you and nap if you let her! Because we are foster based, we require an approved application before a meet and greet can be scheduled. We think that is fair for our fosters so every meet and greet has the potential to result in an immediate adoption. The application is available on the rescue website and can be completed online.We work with many rescues and strive to find every rescued dog in our care a great home. Sometimes that means transferring that pet to another location where adoption may be more likely. We currently have partners in New York, Pennsylvania, and Vermont.\n\nIf you are interesting in meeting any of our pets, the process is to complete an application. It can be downloaded as a pdf document from our website and submitted by email to WindyRidgeRescue@gmail.com as a scanned document or as photos OR can be completed entirely online. Both links are in the header of our website.\n\nBecause we are foster based, we require an approved application to schedule a meet and greet. We feel that is fair to our fosters and rescues so every meet and greet can result in an adoption.\n\nWe do not have set adoption fees for dogs, but hope adopters will donate generously so we can rescue more. The medical care for every dog can easily exceed the adoption donation. Average adoption fees for dogs in the area range from $175 up to $450.\n\nWe ask for a minimum adoption donation of $50 for cats regardless of age. Each cat is up to date on vaccinations, dewormer, and microchipped. Larger donations are always welcome so we can rescue more. Medical care for each cat easily exceeds the minimum donation.\n\nAs with every rescue, our resources are limited and the need for rescue help is unlimited. Your generosity helps us to rescue more.\n\nAdopting or fostering for a rescue frees up a space where a new rescue can reside.\n\nIf you can't adopt or foster, than please consider donating.",

            "description": "What do you get when you combine a little bit of flour and a little bit a fat, and some spice for an extra kick? The perfect Roux of course! At 3 years old, I am a young energetic gent weighing in at 60lbs. You know, there is a Louisiana French phrase that goes Losh pa la pa tot which means dont let go of the potato or dont give up. And that enduring spirit has led me all the way from the South to St.Helens to find my new family! Big and boisterous I still have a lot of puppy like character and a very baby huey playstyle with my dog friends. I am just a big goof and dont have a ton of impulse control just yet, but the ladies say that I am very smart and quick to catch onto the basics like sit. Plus, I am very food motivated which helps with my training. Even though I am just a big oaf, I can still have my sensitive ninny moments, like the other day on my walks some leaves blew all at once and I was like woah what is that and why did it happen? But with some tasty treats, I quickly learned that it wasnt a big deal. Due to my size and careless bounces, I am looking for a house with kiddos over 14 and no kitties. Though dog parks are too much for me, I do enjoy playing one on one with doggies who can keep up with my annoying puppy like antics (and maybe also teach me how to take play breaks!). Handsome, playful, and full of spunk.Roux is going to need an adopter that is able to be around him most of the time. He is very well crate trained and seems to enjoy his time in the crate. He needs frequent potty breaks outside, where he loves to run and play and pick stuff up. He is a very heavy chewer and will need appropriate toys that he won't be able to eat. Roux's adoption fee is $250.00, he is neutered, current on vaccines, treated for fleas and treated for worms. If you are interested in meeting Roux we ask that you please email adoption@columbiahumane.org in order to obtain an application. Please note that all adoptions are done by appointment only. We will only schedule an appointment once you have an approved application on file. Please NO PHONE CALLS, email inquiry's are the easiest way to get ahold of us, as we spend the majority of the days working with our animals and are not available to answer phone calls.For more information call 503-397-4353 or email animalwelfare@columbiahumbia.org",

To arrange a meet and greet with a dog, you MUST fill out the adoption application so that it can be sent to the foster parent for review to determine if your home is a match for the dog. If a dog receives multiple applications, we operate on a best-fit basis, not first come first served.***\n\n\nHi My name is Trudy Judy! I'm a 3 year old hound mix with the sweetest face and biggest most floppiest ears! I'm so sweet and a really good girl. \n\n\nI have a very funny personality --- I can be so calm and sleepy for most of the day but when my family starts to move around I definitely want to go see what's happening and play! I also get some fun zoomies after my walks. As I feel better each day I'm more and more ready to play and have fun with my people! \n\n\nI'm learning about toys and what's ok and not ok to chew on. I'm pretty smart and have a guilty conscience so I'm learning fast! When I play I fly around in speedy circles -- I'm so gentle but can forget myself a bit when I zoom around and get excited, for that reason I probably would do best in a home without small children so I don't knock them over. \n\n\nOn walks I do well in my harness. If I pick up a good smell I'll try to follow my nose and may pull a little. Because of my love for sniffing and my playful energy I'd love a home with an active family who will keep me entertained and happy. I'd also ideally love to have another dog and/or a yard for playtime. \n\n\nMy ideal day would have some snoozies, a few play sessions with my people or dog brother/sister, and time outside to enjoy all the amazing smells! \n\n\nI currently live in a foster home with another dog. She's older and doesn't like to play with me and I respect that well. I do sneak in cuddles with her though!! \n\n\nI'm crate trained and sleep in my crate at night and when my people are gone. \n\n\nI'm a very curious little lady and like to explore all around with my hound nose. \n\n\nI am heartworm positive and am receiving treatment from Second Chance. \n\nI am spayed, up-to-date on vaccinations, microchipped, has been dewormed, and is current on her monthly flea/tick and heartworm preventatives. My adoption fee is $300. If you think I could be the one for you, please fill out an adoption application at www.secondchancenc.org. Thank you!",

She's a sweet girl, so she was adopted immediately. AC recently returned to the shelter for nipping during a bath. Although AC is a fear-biter (protective), she's good with most people and small dogs. AC needs a home without young children, that is sensitive to her needs--to make her feel safe. We reunited her with dogs at our center who came from the same home. She's been happy and playful, but lacks confidence, so will need to be in a home with one of them, or another dog. Apply to meet her: adoptocpets.org/adopt",

This girl is a riot to watch when you bring out the vacuum cleaner, when she chases her tail, or when she has after-shower zoomies. She loves any toy that squeaks, and her favorite thing of all time is cheese in her WestPaw toy - she will lick and lick and lick to get out every last morsel of cheese.\n\nL is for LOVE. She loves to give it and she loves to receive it. Bella has the best sense of those around her. If I am having a conversation with someone and I become teary she immediately is at my side looking into my eyes and comforting me. She loves to be snuggled and scratched and brushed and played with. \n\nL is for Lucky. Bella went from being a stray in Texas to having a warm bed to sleep in at night, lots of toys and treats to keep her occupied, and walkies every day!\n\nA is for Awesome! Bella has learned SO much in the time that I've had her. She is a fast learner and wants to make you happy. She has learned, \"\"sit,\"\" \"\"stay,\"\" \"\"down,\"\" \"\"gimme paw,\"\" \"\"high five,\"\" and we are working on \"\"leave it.\"\" She LOVES dog food - treat dispenser puzzles and - of course - the aforementioned squeaky toys. \n\nWe have been working on her socialization skills when I can find other confident and calm dogs her size or larger to show her the ropes. She has been very sweet with children, but I live alone so I haven't seen her in a \"\"living with children\"\" setting. I have not had the opportunity to see how she responds to cats but she is reactive on a leash when we're out walking and she sees other dogs, so someone who can help her learn leash skills would be a good thing. She does really well in a harness on her walks and pulls much less than with just a collar. She has already made tremendous improvements. \n\nShe would benefit from some basic training and really wants to make her people proud. She would probably be best as an only dog in the home. She has very strong paws and when she plays she can be rambunctious so she needs someone who can help keep her calm, or who can handle her strength. I am working on her not jumping up on her hoomans. She wants to be responsive, but she is learning to stay down while still showing interest. \nShe LOVES to go walking, hiking, and wandering, and she was very interested in water when we found a little stream. She walked right into it and loved it. She has webbed feet and the longest dog toes so I'm pretty sure she will be an awesome swimmer. She would LOVE a yard where she can have her morning zoomies and, she would benefit from daily walks. \n\nShe goes in her kennel well, and is very comfortable there, especially with a blanket covering her. But if she knows you're in the other room she might scratch to be with you at night. She is 100% potty trained and does an excellent job! She adjusts to routines very well and hardly makes a peep (unless she hears a knock at the door or the doorbell - we're working on that). \n\nHer potential forever family needs to be strong and confident in their ability to love her and care for her and remember that she is the rescue, and she is not an emotional support animal. She is sweet and loving, but she will benefit from a routine and extra encouragement and support. \n\nDogs are not placed on a first-come, first-serve basis. We strive to find the perfect home for each animal. Applications may take up to 48 hours to process.\n\nAll CAWS animals are fixed, microchipped, and vaccinated. Her adoption fee is $200.

I am housetrained and just sleep while my foster mom is gone - I know not to bark or destroy things. I'm a lap dog to my core and really enjoy cuddling and giving kisses. Even though I'm a youngster, I'm a lower energy dog; I do like to run around some, but honestly, I'm more interested in sitting in your lap and watching TV with you. I have met other small dogs and puppies as big as 22# and done totally fine with them, too. If you are looking for a sweet, lowkey, cuddly pup with cute, big ears then reach out to ARNO about coming to meet me! I cannot wait to find my forever home soon!\n\n\nMy adoption fee is $200. This includes a spay/neuter, up-to-date vaccines, deworming, a microchip, a heartworm test, and, if needed, heartworm treatment.\n\n________________________________________________\n\nFor more information email: adopt@animalrescueneworleans.org.\n\nTo complete an application, please visit: https://animalrescueneworleans.org/adoptfoster/.\n\n________________________________________________\n\nFor all animals that have not been spayed or neutered a $100 deposit will be required in addition to the adoption fee.

I'm housetrained, and my foster mom says my best traits are my playfulness and cuddly personality. I love to play with my toys and with other small dogs - my favorite game to play with them is 'chase'. I have met puppies and did fine with them, too. After some play time, I really enjoy a good cuddle session, and I think that I make an A+ cuddle partner. If you are looking for a playful and snuggly pup with an irresistible smile, I'm the lady for you!

We also only adopt within a 2-hour driving distance of Goshen, IN. ***\n\n.***Please know we are not a shelter and are NOT open to the public. All meet and greets are arranged only AFTER an application is submitted and reviewed. \n\nSweet Chianti is a knock out in looks and personality, Chianti is a 4-year-old retired racer who recently joined Greyt Angels.  Chianti is adjusting to retirement and enjoying the fenced yard in her foster home and her foster greyhound sibling.  Chianti will be available for adoption shortly and we will update her information as we get to know her.    Chianti will not be available to a home with small children.   For more information on Chianti please email greytangels@gmail.com.\n\nWe LOVE the support and interest of every inquiry on our hounds!!! At this time, however, we are a smaller group, so we must limit our adoptions to a two-hour radius of our home base of Goshen, Indiana. This enables us to better provide support to our adopters and our hounds, when needed, for a more successful adoption experience!",
