He is high energy, but is working really hard on sitting for treats! He loves walks and attention. Because of his size, he would do best in a home with older children, as he is still young and likes to jump! Basic command / obedience training would be very helpful! He doesn't seem overly reactive to other dogs, but would probably do best as the only furbaby in the home. He is good with cats.",

I would do best in a home with no children under 12, and a home without cats. I'm a little shy in the kennels, but i warm up quickly with treats and scratches! I'm pretty energetic, so I would love to find an active family who have a nice backyard for me to run around in. I would not be a great fit for those in an apartment.Please note that due to COVID-19 we are temporarily requiring appointments to meet with our adoptable animals. If you would like to meet with an animal please send an email to info@solanospca.com with your name, phone number, name of the animal you would like to meet, any questions you have about them and when you would like to meet them during our regular office hours listed below. Once received SPCA office staff will send you an adoption application with further instructions.\n\nM-T: Closed\nW: 2-5pm\nTh-Su: 12-5pm",

WE are a high intake No Kill Shelter ran by a staff of 4 and do not always have time to answer every question asked by so many. If you are a good fit for the animal you are interested in -we will call to speak with you, If we feel you are not a good fit , we will contact you about other pets that may be a good fit for your home. Many people are losing the opportunity to adopt the animal they want because they fail to put in an application and the pet was adopted before we could answer your email. .If you have applied for an animal in our facility and have not received a response within 7 days, PLEASE call or contact us again. Though we do our best in trying to answer all emails in a timely manner, sometimes things get away from us, get lost or misplaced. It is never our intention to ignore a request about an adoptable animal in our facility.\n\nSandy Brown, Director, PAW Animal Shelter\n\n319-372-2274",

I can NOT go to a home in a city or county with pitbull restrictions!\n\nSabin is the sweetest 3 yr old lab mix pup he loves to be with humans so much! He does amazing outside the crate when left alone, I usually just leave him in my room. At 70 lbs, Sabin still thinks he is a lap dog and loves cuddling and staring into his humans eyes! \n\nSabin gets along with dogs that are bigger than 30 lbs and are on the submissive side. Slow intro is always advised. He loves my twos dogs and really loves to play. No small dogs or cats though. Sabin does really well on a leash walking with the dogs he already knows, but he can have leash reactivity when meeting new dogs, so he needs a human who will keep working on the training with him. He is very food motivated and I have had success training him by bribing with treats! \n\nHe is allergic to many foods and is on a special kibble diet (Instinct turkey brand) that will need to be followed. He had an ACL surgery (over 2 months ago) and is nicely recovering at home we are now going on short walks! Sabin will truly make a wonderful dog for anyone who is lucky enough to adopt him",

            "description": "Meet Drax! While he is as burly as his namesake, all Drax wants is a cuddle buddy who will give him all the belly rubs. Drax is about 4 years old and about 52 pounds, and has the cutest speckled coat ever. He loves to play with toys, especially those with squeakies, and will even jump in the air to catch them-because nothing goes over his head. Drax does well in his crate and is quickly mastering skills like sit in his foster home, but still needs some work on the leash. He can be a chill lap dog, but also loves to run and fetch. Drax gets along fine with the other dogs in his foster home, but would also be fine with being an only dog so all the toys and attention can be his. He would do best in a house with no cats though. Sometimes Drax doesn't know how big he is, so may not be the best fit for a house with young children, but if everyone is over about 10, bring them on! Are you his forever cuddle partner? Contact us now! All Dallas Pets Alive adoptable pets are spayed or neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines upon adoption.

All 3 dogs were in fairly rough condition, and Peggy was no exception.\nPeggy had a large hernia, a wire from a fractured jaw that should have been removed ages ago, rotten teeth, and an abscess on her face. She got all fixed up, and now she\u2019s ready for a new home.\n\nIn true chihuahua form, she has a bit of a tude. If you aren\u2019t a fan of chihuahuas, Peggy is not for you. She is skeptical of people at first and can be a little snippy (although she doesn\u2019t have many teeth left so not much damage done there) but once she loves you, she is as loyal as can be.\n\nHer favorite things are car rides, smooches on her cheek, and sleeping under the covers with her favorite human.\n\nAn ideal home for Peggy would have dogs her size only, a human she can snuggle, and no small children or kitties.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in Peggy, please submit an application to www.radrescueinc.org",

Don't let the stern look fool you, Rock is adorable, happy, outgoing and loves to snuggle/get attention from his humans! While he settles down nicely to hang our with the family, he also loves to go for walks, especially if he gets to meet new people. \n\nRock found himself through no fault of his own in a rural North Carolina shelter. Poor Rock did not understand why no one came to get him and he had lost the comforts of a home. PetConnect came to his rescue and has brought him to the DC area to find his new home that will adore him furever. \n\nIf you are looking for a very sweet, happy dog who will greet you with wiggle butts and gentle \"kisses\", Rock may be the one for you. He adores people of all ages, particularly loves to cuddle, get pets, and will make a wonderful family pet that is happy to join in the activities. He seems to understand housetraining and appropriate chew items. He would be a great companion to curl up in your lap to hang out on a cool winter evening. Rock is neutered, up-to-date on vaccines and preventatives and eager to find a family to love! The adoption fee for Rock is $350, which includes routine vetting, vaccines, spay/neuter, and heartworm treatment. \n\n***Please note that the first step in the adoption process is to complete an application so that we can discuss which dogs are best fits for you and for them. An important step in the process is to complete a vet check. Vetting of current and past pets is very important to us, thus we will be speaking with the vet(s) listed on your application to ensure that your current and previous pet(s) are kept up to date on vaccines (including rabies ) , spayed or neutered, maintained on appropriate monthly preventatives and examined annually by your vet.*** Complete an online application, and contact Robin at kinstondogs@verizon.net if you would like more information on Rock!.",

She is shy and wary of sudden movements and when she first meets new people. She will need to go to a home without toddlers or small children.

This girl will do pretty much anything for a snacky snack!\n\nShe came to us from Maricopa County Animal Care after one of our volunteers saw her at the shelter. She wasn't loving shelter life so we busted her outta there in hopes of finding her a forever home!\n\nTink is quickly becoming a volunteer favorite and attends our weekly Mutt Manners training classes! This girl loves to learn!\n\nShe is approximately 2 years old, spayed, vaccinated and microchipped. Her ideal home would be one without other pets because she wants to keep her people all to herself and be your one and only. \n\nIf you're interested in meeting her, please submit an adoption application: https://www.oneloveaz.org/adoption-process\n\nAll dogs in our VIP (Very Important Pits) Program receive post adoption support and access to our free weekly Mutt Manners training classes. \n\nAdoption Fees vary based on shelter promotions but are generally less than $50.",

She came from the streets and has the battle scars to prove it. Desiree is a nervous girl and will need someone who has the time and patience to show her that the world is safe. Desiree can be very fearful with strangers and will nip if she feels overwhelmed. For this reason, she is only handled by our most experienced and dog savvy volunteers. \n\nDesiree would do best in a home with an experienced and patient dog owner. She does well with other dogs but she is not good with children. \n\n**Please note: Desiree does have a bite on her record. She bit a volunteer as she was being loaded into a crate on her way to the veterinarian. We would recommend a home without children due to her history. She does not do well going into or out of crates. Desiree will also attempt to bite if she feels threatened and cannot escape.**\n\nWe are just getting to know Desiree and we will provide updates as we learn more about her.",

We are so glad that the Helping Paw Project reached out to us to help Shelby. Thanks to amazing volunteers we were able to commit to her. We had a foster step up for Shelby and a driver willing to take her to meet her new foster mom today. Shelby is a pretty chill girl and seems to be fully housebroken. She gets along great with other dogs and formerly lived in a home with a cat for a little while and has been good with children. She is very sweet and gentle and we believe would fit in and just about any home. Shelby is up to date on all of her vetting but we will be taking her in to get all checked over as she has had some trouble with ear infections in the past and we want to make sure that her ears are looking and feeling OK now.Shelby will be available for adoption in a couple of weeks after we get to know her better. She will also be available as a 'forever foster/sponsor me' girl if a family would like to offer that for her.",

            "description": "Ruby is a smart, confident dog who is ready for her forever home. She\u2019s about 1.5 to 2 years old and is an absolute love bug. She will go in her crate after a couple of barks to let you know that she\u2019s doing it under duress but then she quickly calms down and naps. Ruby loves to play and snuggle. She knows \u201csit\u201d and \u201coff\u201d and \u201cdown\u201d but will need some work on leash manners as she just wants to go everywhere as soon as she can get there. She loves treats and is quite playful - she probably would do better with another dog or an active owner who is going to take her for lots of exercise and safe dog parks. She seems to love everyone and every animal she comes across. She is really curious about cats but so far, I have not found a cat that was too keen on meeting her. I have a feeling she may be a bit exuberant for most cats. Ruby just wants to sit at your feet and be close by for all your adventures. She is game for just about anything - she likes walks, she likes car rides and will hop right in car and then jump on the seat and she likes just hanging out at home chewing on bones, toys or pig ears. She is not destructive and would be a great addition to any active family.\n\nEmail info@habitat4paws.org for an application.\n\n**Because we require home visits, we only adopt locally to the Dallas/Fort Worth area. For more on adoption policies, please see the Adopt page of our website, www.habitat4paws.org.",

Her foster Dad says she has been the perfect house guest-house trained, not demanding or high maintenance. She adores her foster Dad & is very much a velcro dog. We believe Ella is an Anatolian Shepherd mix. She matches the temperament description: Bold, Intelligent, Steady, Independent, Confident, Proud and yes...stubborn. Ella has met a few dogs, small & medium, and seems indifferent to their presence. Due to her breed, an experienced adopter is preferred. The perfect match would be a home with a patient family. This girl will need time to adjust to new situations and family. Older children only due to age & size. Everyone that meets her, falls in love.\n\n\nIf you are interested in one of our animals, please complete an application. The application link can be found on our Petfinder homepage under the picture. You may also find our application on our website at www.teammemphis.org  under the Our Rescue page. If they are listed on our website, their adoptions have not been finalized yet. That does not mean that we have not received several applications, already. Please complete an application if you are interested and we will keep you apprised of their current status. We are all volunteers who work full-time jobs and have animals of our own, so please be patient with us. We will get back with you as quickly as possible.",

            "description": "Sweet Sienna is the easy going gal you\u2019ve been looking for. This 4 year old, 50lbs gal hails from the stray streets of Chicago. Her past traumas may be unknown but she is as loving as can be. Sienna has some ocular damage that is likely permanent and left her with limited vision in her left eye. Have no worries, as it has no impact and doesn\u2019t cause any pain. Sienna is potty trained and crate trained. She is learning commands-- now knows sit, and walks well on a leash. She also comes when you call her. This gentle girl likes people, but prefers no kids as they make her a little nervous. Sienna has a little \"Stranger-danger\" at first and is a go slow kinda gal. Sienna is an introvert and likes a quiet slow pace. She\u2019s also dog friendly. However, she is not the romp and wrestle type. She prefers no contact sports like chase. Sienna loves to cuddle and enjoys dressing up. Just when you think it can\u2019t get better, it does!! She loves to sleep in your bed or on her own cozy dog bed all night long. She can also be trusted out when her humans are away. Sienna is a gentle, calm girl looking for a quiet home to share her life with.\n\n\nOur adoption fee is $260 for dogs over 5 months of age and includes all vaccinations, spay/neuter, micro chip implantation and registration/transfer, heartworm test and much more. Puppies up to 5 months of age are $275 and this includes all sets of puppy vaccinations, spay/neuter, microchip implantation and registration and more. To adopt, go to www.fosterpetoutreach.org to complete an application.\nPlease note: Foster Pet Outreach tries to limit our adoptions to an area within approximately 60 miles of Peoria, Illinois.",

He is just under a year old, a great weight at 38 pounds, and he has a gorgeous black tri coat and full tail.  Nash is housebroken, crate-trained, knows some basic obedience commands and he rides nicely in the car when he is not trying to \u201cchase\u201d the cars driving in the opposite direction!  Nash does need work walking on the leash.  He will try to chase cars, race to greet other dogs or chase the random cat or squirrel, and you have to be ready for his pull in that direction.\nNash loves people.  He is a medium Velcro dog who wants to be with you but does not have to be underfoot \u2013 hanging out in the same room, watching TV or getting belly scratches, is fine with him!  Nash has not had a lot of opportunities to meet other dogs, and while he really enjoys playing with other dogs he is still learning how to properly greet them \u2013 crazy excited yelping is not the answer!  Nash is a medium-to-high energy dog with an \u201coff switch\u201d, who loves to walk, hike, explore, play ball, play tug-of-war, play with toys and play chase, and then nap.  \nThe ideal home for Nash is active and fun, with plenty of time for this friendly, energetic young guy. A fenced yard and another happy young dog are important, children over the age of 12 are fine, but cats would not appreciate meeting Nash in their home!  It is also important that his family continue his training \u2013 he has so much potential and we know that he is and will be an amazing dog.  If you can see Nash in your home, as part of your family, apply today!  Nash is fostered in Clarksville, TN.\n",

            "description": "My name is Paprika.  I am about 4 years old but very puppyish and goofy - I'm sure to make you smile and laugh with my sunny personality.\nI have been on a few adventures in my life.  When rescued by DRNM in mid 2019, I was pregnant with 9 puppies. My puppies and I found homes; when I was spayed, precautions were taken since I have Von Willebrand and came through surgery with flying colors.  Over time I have been able to withstand normal little nicks, cuts and scratches that are part of a doggie life and heal just fine.\n\nHowever, this has never kept me from being a bouncy ball of fun, I am a puppy trapped in a giant body!  My favorite things in the world are food, cuddling, doggie toys and humans and I will do anything for those.\n\nI  am super affectionate and I LOVE PEOPLE, I will lick you to death, follow you everywhere and I am very good at coming when you call me because being with you is my greatest joy in life. \n\nI am always alert and eager to please. I pay attention to details, I always want to make sure that your house is safe and to be told that I am a good girl taking care of my peeps. I am not a barker at all, but I will definitely let you know if any cats, squirrels or delivery men are near.\n\nI know all my basic commands and I will follow any of them immediately if food is a reward (I was a starved street dog at some point and food is a BIGGIE for me). However, I need an firm owner because when there is no food treat involved to make me sit pretty, I do behave a like a giant, fun-loving puppy. I need to be reminded of what the rules are that you want me to follow. I forget that I have this big, strong body, so I do need rules and consistency.\n\nI will make you laugh with my cheerful spirits, and cuddle with you for long naps after playtime. I love my blanket and my pillow, and I know not to jump on furniture.\n\nI love to play but I can play a bit rough because I don\u2019t know my strength when I get excited. I will chase after anything that moves fast (so cats are not a safe housemate for me). I also need to be reminded not to nip or lick when I get stressed or overjoyed. I am very enthusiastic and scent driven, so I like to look for treasures in your dirty laundry hamper or unattended trash cans if you leave them out because who doesn\u2019t like a scavenger hunt, right? \n\nI like older children, and I am fine around them, but I am too big and goofy to be safely left alone with someone not mature or big enough to give me boundaries.\n\nSimilarly, I don\u2019t dislike other dogs, but sometimes other dogs don\u2019t like me, since I don\u2019t always have the best doggie manners with my peers. I don\u2019t initiate fights, but I don\u2019t listen to them when they tell me to back off: I won\u2019t take their  \u201cgrowl\u201d as a NO or let them get in my way if there is something I covet.  Therefore, I won\u2019t do well with another alpha dog with a strong personality or another dog I have to compete with.   I am fine with laid back dogs who don\u2019t mind that I get my way, but I don\u2019t do well with competition at all.\n\nBecause I was deprived of things when I lived in the street, I have strong survival instincts, and I always want to be the first to get my human\u2019s attention, get that toy or that piece of food before everyone else, and other pets don\u2019t like that I don\u2019t wait my turn, or that I ignore their body language if they are scared or angry.  So my lack of doggie manners with playmates have led to some misunderstandings and fights. I am not straight out aggressive with other dogs. I enjoy them if they don\u2019t try to boss me around, but I am known not back down if there is confrontation.\n\nHumans are my favorite thing in the world, and I will be your shadow, and be your best buddy everywhere you go.  There is nothing I like more than to be indoors with you and if you have an extra blanket to tuck me in, I will wrap in it, and nap next to you and enjoy the spoiled life. However I love camping and hiking, or just hanging out with you in the yard. I have as much fun inside as I do outside but I need a tall fence if you take me in the yard because I am smart, agile and crafty and I love to explore scents. Please know, I will need lots of hugs on the 4th of July and New Year\u2019s Eve because I am terrified of fireworks, and of thunder. \n\nSo if you are looking for an adventure companion or cuddle buddy, I will be your best friend for life, just know that I need clear boundaries and consistent communication to let me know how to be my best doggie-self.\n\nA $300 adoption fee applies.",

Sadly, she came to us with her fur-brother, Beau, after their owners lost their home.   \n\nMeadow is a sweet gal.  She walks fairly well on the leash and loves to go for car rides.   She isn't a fan though of sharing toys with her brother.  Meadow's favorite afternoon is spent playing, eating and sleeping.   Doesn't that sound amazing?!\n\nMeadow has never been around little humans,  but we think older kids would probably be fine!   Meadow thoroughly enjoys chasing squirrels, so kitties are probably a no go.   \n\nWould you welcome your home and heart to this beautiful baby?

A really easy going and non-confrontational similar-sized pooch may be okay.  Meet and greet required and slow introductions.\n\nCats: No, thank you.\n\nKids: No, thank you. Too much for kids. \n\nHousing Type: A detached home only.  A townhome with someone home often and where loud barking could be okay. \n\nFenced in yard: A fully fenced backyard or if in a country setting with no neighbours where she will not be left unattended or off leash outside.\n\n\nSpecial: Someone eager to work with a trainer (virtually) to continue working on providing Scarlett the structure and confidence building she needs.  Scarlett is part of our RAD (Recovery Adoption Dogs) Program.  This means she will need a few meet and greets, her adoption trial is a month long and she will come with 3 training sessions included to ensure you have the tools to help Scarlett succeed in your home!  Calm home is KEY!  Must be in or near the Ottawa area due to meet and greets and for training support.\n\n \n\nScarlett is a very affectionate and very energetic dog, but she also has some difficulty understanding boundaries around personal space. She loves to and aims to please and wants to make her person happy\u2026 she just struggles with controlling her excitement \u2013 picture a dog having had too much coffee!  She came into care with swelling to her head and was tied out to a post.  It is possible that this injury could have caused her difficulty to settle but she has made so much progress.\n\n \n\nScarlett is a wonderful girl: happy, eager to please, sensitive and trusting. She loves to run and play in the fenced-in yard, whether it\u2019s chasing a stick or ball or just expending her energy.  This is much needed as she has lots of energy to burn and would love an active person to share her days. She\u2019s also equally happy to hang around the house and lounge with her favourite blanket or pillow. Whatever she\u2019s doing, she loves to be near her human. Scarlett also likes her crate. She will often use it during the day and at night she is actually eager to \u201cgo to bed.\u201d Once inside, she will thrash about for a few minutes, arguing with her blankets until she gets things just right for sleeping.\n\n \n\nShe is sensitive to heightened energy, movements and interaction from people. A calm household is the key!  She can be easily distracted and overstimulated which causes her anxiety. A chill home life with a predictable schedule that includes brain and body exercise would do her some good! She thrives when she has structure and predictability. She would love someone who will continue to work with her on her leash skills and is looking for a home life that has less visitors, with a fenced in yard and without neighboring dogs.  A country home without neighbours that does not have a fenced in yard would also work, so long as she was never left unattended or off leash. \n\n \n\nScarlett can play with certain other dogs and has demonstrated that she can do this rather well but her meeting of dogs initially can be more challenging.  She is mostly non-confrontational in her approach, however, her level of energy can easily set off other dogs, and should the other dog react, there may be a conflict. Under the right supervision, she has the ability to play with many different kinds of dogs. Due to the current climate, and inability to work on complicated dog-dog introductions, we are seeking a pet-free home or an experience dog owner with a well matched dog for Miss Scarlett that is willing to meet near Ottawa for a meet and greet.\n\n \n\nScarlett responds best to positive and gentle reinforcement. She is so eager to please that it takes very little guide her. For example, if you just wait, she will sit when leaving the house, getting leashed up or eating her food. She looks up at you with those big brown eyes and it melts your heart. She does know some basic commands: sit, come, stay (sort of), bedtime. Your patience with  her needs will be so well rewarded.  She enjoys training time and is very engaging, making good eye contact, responding well to food-based training games and activities.\n\n \n\nShe is currently in board-and-train so is not only seeking a forever home, but would also welcome the opportunity for a dedicated foster home as well.   If you can foster her, please read the information on this page and then click APPLY NOW: http://www.sitwithme.ca/foster/\n\n",

I do a little dance when I want your attention (usually for food or to go outside). The nice people at HALO are giving me some medicine to help some of my fur grow back. You see, I have a flea allergy and that caused some of my fur to fall out. Now that I have all my shots and am on monthly flea prevention, that shouldn't happen again. Yea! I'm very well behaved and I don't have accidents in the house plus I am a total gentleman on a leash. My favorite hobby is napping - always down for a good snooze. As far as friends go, I'm ok with other female dogs, but maybe not male dogs. My poor interaction with other male dogs was my own son, so HALO is trying to figure out how I might be with other males. Cats are ok, too! Having a fenced in yard is a plus so I can do a little roaming around. I would really love to find my new forever home soon. Send me your application and I'll be sure to review it with my friends at HALO. \n\nFill out an application to adopt Zeus here\n\nwww.halok9behavior.com/forms",

He LOVES his entire body rubbed especially his head, however can be agitated when he feels like you\u2019re trying to brush or groom him. Has a good appetite. He currently eats chicken / rice and some soft dog food, but he is not on hard food. He loves the sun, and will sleep in bed with you as long as possible. He is crate trained, sometimes cries, but lays down very soon. He loves going on \u201cadventures\u201d in my fenced yard. He will bark when hungry, thirsty, or wants to be held, lol.\nBDRA has voted against the use of electrical fencing effective immediately.",

            "description": "Hi there! My name is Boogie! I'm a very special girl, who needs a very special person. I absolutely love my human friends, but it can take me awhile to build that trusting relationship. I need someone willing to come visit with me several times before taking me home so we can build a strong relationship first. I get super wiggly and silly when I see my friends, so it's pretty easy to tell once I'm comfortable. I do need an adult only home where my person can provide a calm, stable environment for me. I'm a young girl, with energy to spare! I love to go for walks and hikes, car rides and I love playing with toys! I'm even getting pretty good at agility and I like to show off for my friends. I do like to play with other dogs, but it might not be the best fit for me to live with another dog in a home environment. \n\nBoogie came in as an owner surrender in August. She has been in a home or two, but none that met her needs long-term. She spends some of her days in a staff office, but mostly in her kennel. Boogie LOVES to be with people, it's something she wants more than anything. We see this dog struggling greatly in the shelter environment and want to give her the opportunity to find a family, but it is urgent for her - she is breaking down in the shelter environment each day that goes by. \n\nIf you think I could be a good fit for your home and lifestyle, please reach out directly to lolson@highcountryhumane.org or jtasch@highcountryhumane.org for more info about me! I'm really looking for someone with lots of patience who can keep me safe in a home environment. \n\nMy adoption fee is now fully sponsored thanks to generous donors!",

She is always so happy and has a zest for life like no other dog we\u2019ve seen, especially with her circumstances. She was hit by a vehicle in October of 2020 and suffered severe eye trauma as a result, which required a double enucleation. In true Adira spirit, she didn\u2019t let this get her down. She runs, plays, jumps and is completely housebroken! She loves people with all her heart. Be prepared for her to follow you literally everywhere. She has such an infectious personality and brings joy to everyone she meets. The Veterinary staff fell in love with her and even sent her with some extra peanut butter (her favorite!). Despite the vehicle incident, Adira is extremely healthy and all scarring has healed beautifully.\nBDRA has voted against the use of electrical fencing effective immediately.",

Corky loves to go for a walk and does pull on the leash when he first gets out of his kennel because he is so excited to go. Once he walks for a while, he calms down and walks easily on the leash. Volunteers that have taken him for a walk have said that he likes his treats and takes them gently. He knows \"sit\". He's very affectionate and loves butt scratches. Corky can be very dog selective so if you have another dog at home, he will need proper intros.\n\nCorky is good with Kids!!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting CORKY please visit our website for our online application www.underdogaz.com",

            "description": "Three-year-old Mint is a charming, sensitive companion. He enjoys training and exploring on walks, but can take a bit of time to gain comfort with people. Due to this, Mint will require an adult only home and would do best in a home with a yard, as apartment living would be too overwhelming. While Mint may enjoy having outside K9 buddies, Mint will need to be the only dog in his new home. It might take some time to become Mint's favorite, but he will make it worth your while. He enjoys playing with his stuffed toys, exploring the landscaping and playing Agility games. Mint is a bit more into doing activities than he is into cuddling, but there's nothing he loves more than a cozy bed. ARF is seeking a patient adopter willing to work with this sensitive dog using reward-based methods and support from our Behavior Staff. ARF will facilitate a meet and greet with Mint's potential adopter prior to finalizing his adoption. He currently weighs 15 pounds.Mint's adoption fee has been prepaid by a generous donor. Mint's adopter must be at least 18 years old with valid state-issued identification. ARF encourages family members to participate in the adoption process, especially children and family dogs. Please visit ARF's web site for information on adoption and to view more cute canines.",

            "description": "Hello, I'm Conner! There are a few quick things you should know about me before clicking that button to inquire about me. I'm a young puppy at around 4 months of age. Right now I'm around 15 pounds and who knows how big I'm going to get. I'm a breed known as Red Tick Hound if that helps matters. \n\nI have all of that puppy adorableness that makes people positively swoon. Even though I'm just a wee babe, I am playful yet respectful with my two doggie roommates. One of them is a grown adult 3 times my size and the other is another adult but he's my size and one of those fluffy dogs. Both of them tolerate my puppy-ness easily because I don't overdo it and I have learned to respect their boundaries. Not bad for a baby eh?!\n\nLet's see, what else do you need to know about me. Well, if you just imagine CUTIE-PIE-PUPPY then I think you'll get the gist of the rest of me. Alright! Ready to hit that inquire button? I'm ready to meet you! Love, Conner\n",

She has a few scuffs from her previous life, including some scars on her ears, and is tentative when meeting new people, but she warms up quickly. She is a bit underweight at 40 lbs but she is muscular and her coat is very shiny. Waffles is learning leashwalking, cratetraining ,and how to interact with other dogs in her foster home. She rides well in a car and rests quietly in her crate; she has had no crate accidents and reliably takes care of business outside in the fenced back yard when taken out. Waffles gets along well with the large mellow dogs in her foster home, but NO cats, please. Waffle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foster family is feeding her in her crate, as it seems she has been competing for nutrition, so is protective of her food. She is not yet tolerant of too much curiosity or excitement from other dogs and becomes very nervous if met with a rush of exuberance. Her foster parents can see her reservations diminishing rapidly and are confident that she will be a great addition to any family seeking a beautiful, sometimes tentative, and sweet house hound!",

She also loves to be taken on walks so she can use her amazing bloodhound nose. When she gets back home, she will sprint back to the comforts of the great indoors! Daisy gets along well with all the other dogs in the foster home, but is very possessive of her bone or chew toy.",

My owner was a veteran which I think is really admirable but then he broke his hip and was hospitalized and then through no fault of my own I ended up in the City Shelter. The good folks at Desert Haven helped me out of there and brought me here to live until I find my new family. \n\nI'm only about 9 months old so that's a lot of jostling around for a puppy but I have made it to safety now. Whew! I've even retained all my super cool and fun qualities through it all! You know what they say about youngens, we're resilient! Now, on to the next chapter of my life. \n\nOh, you want to know some of those super cool and fun qualities I have? First of all, I love to play. I like to play with toys and play tug with people. I need a slow introduction to dogs and then I can do well and like to play and romp.  I'm gregarious and playful with my roommates here at Desert Haven.  I'm a little more of a mellow girl when it's just me and the humans (the volunteers who are taking care of me). So I have a nice balance to my winning personality. \n\nI'm also quite smart and already know how to \"sit\" when asked (hint: keep treats for me in your pocket). I'm still a puppy so I'll need to learn the ropes when I move in with you. Just let me know when I should pack my bags! Love you already, Lovey Dovey\n\n(Lovey Dovey is around 35 pounds and we don't expect her to get too much bigger.)",

She is entertaining and certainly knows when she is entertaining you, such a ham this girl. Her kind spirit will charm you and you will fall in love fast! Come meet wendy today! Wendy is available as a foster to adopt due to a medical condition. She has an autoimmune blood disorder that has responded well to medications. She will need to be on medication for until approximately Feb 2021 and have her bloodwork monitored monthly until then. AWD will do follow up care for this condition for 6 months while she is with her new adopters. This will be considered a foster to adopt. If after 6 months- the adopters feel they want to proceed with adoption- they may do so and any further care will need to be at their expense. They will need to have her monitored closely and follow up with their own personal veterinarian for further advice. The adopter should speak to the veterinarian on staff prior to adoption/fostering.",

She was even chosen as a \u2018Staff Pick\u2019. Here\u2019s what they had to say about her: \u201cPrincess\u2019 age is unknown, but she\u2019s most likely two or three, and has been at CFC for about two months. Many are struck by just how much Princess loves people. Her trademark happy whine can be heard whenever staff members approach her pen. Her go-to move when someone comes to visit is to stand on her hind legs and gently wrap her front paws around the nearest person to give them a hug. Without a litter of puppies to worry about, Princess has seen a surge in energy and playfulness. She loves fetch and will happily chase ball after ball before rolling over for some well-earned belly rubs. The entire staff has fallen in love with this sweet girl and we think you will, too!\u201d",

            "description": "Hi, I'm Lincoln! I was originally adopted and now returned due to my previous owner's personal reason. I'm a fun-loving, energetic, goofy, and happy 4 1/2-year old, 55-pound brindle pittie mix, who loves playing fetch/tug of war with my favorite ball or rope, going on long walks, hiking and exploring new places, meeting new people, and when my energy is all expended, cuddling up with my humans. I am fully house-trained and know a full array of commands, such as Sit, Down, Stay, Come, Touch, Watch Me, Paw, Other Paw, and Drop It. I am adaptive, super friendly, loyal, and I brighten up the room with my infectious smile and goofy antics. I am neutered and up-to-date on all of my shots and vaccinations and have no health issues. My ideal home would be with experienced dog owners who are loving and active people that have the time and ability to take me on walks, runs, trips to the park, play, and give me lots of love and attention. While I currently live in Brooklyn, the big city sometimes stresses me out so I would do best somewhere a bit quieter with more space and access to a backyard, nearby park, or somewhere where I can run around freely! While I am good with most dogs and love running around with my other fur-friends, I would do best being the only dog in a household so I can get all the love and attention. I would do well in a home with older children or teenagers, but a home with young children, toddlers, or infants may not be best for me. I am very food-motivated and eager to please, so I'm very trainable and responsive to commands. I sometimes get triggered on a leash by skateboards or certain large dogs that antagonize me, so it's important to keep up with my training and maintain consistency so I don't get too rambunctious (distracting me with a treat and using the \"Touch\" command works wonders)! If you are interested in adopting me, please fill out the online application at https://amaanimalrescue.org/pet/lincoln-formerly-lucky/",

Star has many positive qualities! My favorite ... she greets all people enthusiastically, tries hard to please her humans and playing tug with her daddy, at every opportunity.  I want everyone to know even though Star has been here for a while there is nothing wrong with Star.  In fact, there is so much right!  She has solid obedience skills, loves to cuddle, is happy, smart and friendly.  As I wait for an appropriate adopter, one with a fenced yard, no young kiddos, someone who knows how (or is willing to learn) to manage behaviors that deal with resource guarding and a dog that has tendencies to overreact at the sight of new dogs that she has come so far from a few months ago.  I\u2019m trying to share her behaviors with a positive spin, because Star is quite possibly the most happiest dog you could encounter.  She never has a bad day and is never in a bad mood.  Our family does the best we can, and we will continue to help Star be the best she can be.\n\nI\u2019m hoping there is a special heart out there who will see Star\u2019s beautiful soul and give her the forever home she deserves.\u201d",

            "description": "A note from Nevile's foster family: Neville (we call him Nevi) is a sweet boy who enjoys taking walks and is good on a leash. He loves hanging out with his humans on the couch, bed or any comfy place. He often seeks out affection and attention and is always excited to greet his humans when they get home. He loves to be around people and is great company. He appreciates treats and takes them gently. Although Nevi is scared to get into cars and will try to avoid getting inside, he is fine on drives once inside. He should be picked up and placed inside the car until he becomes more comfortable when going for a drive. Nevi is very good with children and people in general. As to other animals, it is very important and highly recommended to have slow introductions between Nevi and other dogs in the home (we only have one male dog and do not know how he is towards female dogs and/or cats). When Nevi initially arrived in our home, there was an adjustment period between him and our resident dog. However, now they follow each other around all the time and have become good friends. Nevi would probably benefit from having a dog sibling so long as introductions are handled with patience and supervision. When walking him, he does pull towards other animals so that should be considered. Nevi doesn't like bath time and tries to be an escape artist from the tub/shower, but he seems excited to be clean afterwards. When we first welcomed Nevi into our home, he was limping on his back right paw, and he had x-rays performed of his right hip which reflected some broken bones. I don't want to misstate his condition so you should inquire about his medical history through the shelter if interested in adopting to make sure his health status will be a good fit for your lifestyle. He has had an opportunity to rest and recover in our home, and he hasn't been limping recently. This condition doesn't seem to slow him down, and he loves to run and play. We have been limiting/preventing him (post x-rays) from running, playing and jumping to make sure he has sufficient time to heal. Nevi is potty trained. He really is a wonderful dog who deserves to be in a loving forever home. Finally, if you adopt him, we would love to hear how he is doing and would welcome pictures if you are willing to share!",

She is spayed, up to date on all vaccines as well as micro-chipped with Home Again. As of right now we have her on Pedigree Adult Dog Food. She is a wonderful dog, waiting for her FUR-ever home. Her adoption fee is $75.00 card or cash, we DO NOT accept checks. Mia will need a home where she will have a lot of attention, she isn't too much of social butterfly as you'd say. She will need someone who will put a lot of time and work into her. Mia is on the shy side, she does take a while to open up.   \n\nIf interested in adopting her please don't hesitate in calling, showing up for a meet and greet at our facility or email us at pgawaep4@gmail.com.

I'm eager to please, always ready to play, love walks. I always get excited whenever I hear the sound of the keys for a walk! I'm 100% house trained and 100% crate trained, heartworm negative and up to date for all my shots.\nMama and Papa got me as a rescue. When they got me I was dog reactive and we started working with a trainer. Even though I've improved leaps and bounds, I'm finding that apartment living isn't for me. All the sights and sounds is leaving me a little too anxious. The trainer says I should be the only animal in a home with a fenced yard, so I have a lot of open space. I also shouldn't be with a home with small children.\nThe trainer also says I should have an experienced owner, with a firm hand ,who knows how to raise American bulldogs. I can be a stubborn guy, and although Mama and Papa love me very much, they know they can't give me what I need to the best I can be.\nCan you be the one who can give me my best life?\n\nP.S. Mama and Papa will provide my kennel, clothes food, and toys to help me transition to my next chapter.Contact Reg.c.evans@gmail.com with any questions and adoption inquires. ****Courtesy listing**** This dog is not the property of The Buster Foundation.

He is about a year old, loves to play with other dogs, and is a very tall dog. Red does need some help with potty training, but he is a smart dog and a quick leaner. He does know some basic commands. He is very food motivated and shows off his tricks best when he gets a treat after. This guy is very friendly and loves to give kisses on the first date. \n\nBig Red is fixed, vaccinated, microchipped, and dewormed. His adoption fee is $200. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting him, please fill out an application here: www.uvar.us/adopt",

            "description": "Wiley is a handsome adult male Pit Bull Terrier mix who was brought to the HSOV on March 6, 2020 by Good Samaritans who found him on Briggs Hill Road in the Belpre Ohio area.\n\nWiley has a brown/brindle-and-white short smooth coat, a long tail, and a beautiful white face with a small patch of brindle around his right eye and a large patch of brindle at the base of his right ear. He has a rather slender muzzle, a black button nose, and short semi-erect ears.\n\nWiley was a very frightened boy being confined in a kennel when he first entered our shelter and was not a happy camper for the first few weeks with us ? We had hoped that his owner would see the preliminary photos we took on March 8th or that someone will recognize him but, sadly, that did not happen. Wiley was most likely a very different dog in his home with a family who loved him.\n\nWiley weighs approximately 55-60 lbs and has already been neutered.\n\nIn compliance with the Ohio Revised Code, Wiley was held for three days so that his owner would have an opportunity to come and reclaim him with proof of ownership but that happy reunion did not take place.\n\nWiley is beginning to warm up to our kennel techs and, though he is still nervous in our shelter, Wiley is showing us more of his personality. He will obey the 'sit' command, so someone in his past has spent time training him to recognize that word. Wiley also loves treats and appears to be an intelligent boy.\n\nThese updated photos were taken on March 22, 2020 when Wiley accompanied two of our core volunteers whom he has learned to trust. He was still a bit cautious of the 'paparazzi' following him and snapping photos but nice to that lady just the same. Wiley loved the 'good boy' treats which were offered to him in reward for good behavior.\n\nWiley is full of athletic energy, and we\u2019d love to see him in action on a trampoline since he appears to have natural acrobatic skills.\n\nWiley would do best with an experienced handler and an \u2018alpha\u2019 leader who could provide guidance/training so that Wiley could reach his full potential. Our kennel techs would be happy to introduce you to Wiley and to share their experiences/knowledge about him. \n",

            "description": "Sasha is a 7 year old 55lb spayed female Pit Bull Terrier/Beagle mix. She came to us as an owner surrender due to her thriving best in a home with no other dogs or young children. She was a little shy at first, but has come out of her shell and is very friendly and cuddly with staff here at the shelter. She is a quiet girl that enjoys relaxing and snacks... the perfect Netflix partner! She is heartworm positive. This is a curable condition and cannot be passed directly to other animals. She qualified for a 30% off voucher through our Have-A-Heart program. We are open by appointment only to ensure we can properly social distance here at the shelter. We cannot guarantee a specific pet or type of pet will be available at your appointment. We do not hold pets. We operate on a first come first serve basis and while you can put what/who you are interested in in the appointment sign up, all appointments are general dog/cat/other animal appointments since we cannot guarantee what will be available at the time of your appointment. If you would like to set up a non-specific dog or cat appointment we have our scheduling system online now at: https://guilfordcountync.gov/our-county/animal-services/animal-shelter/animal-adoption-scheduling All adopted cats and dogs at Guilford County Animal Services come fully up to date on age appropriate vaccines, spayed/neutered, and microchipped. If you are interested in meeting any of our pets, please visit our website to schedule an appointment online. If you believe this may be your pet, please come to the shelter during business hours and bring your ID, proof of ownership, and proof of spay/neuter and/or rabies vaccination history if you have it. See our reclaiming your pet page for more information. If you have any further questions, please contact us at 336-641-3400 or visit our website at https://guilfordcountync.gov/our-county/animal-services/animal-shelter. Thank you for your interest in helping the animals of Guilford County!",

In fact, the puppies and small males think he is the bomb. \n\nHe has very interesting coloring which I have never seen before. He looks like a yellow lab with a dark brown saddle and gradient coloring between the two with a bob tail that wiggles constantly\n\nChester is crate trained, and when he\u2019s had enough of being affectionately mauled by the other dogs, he likes to go rest in his crate. He likes being outside, but spends a lot of his time in his igloo.\n\nChester, and his sister Maya, spent the first two years of their lives being neglected and abused and kept on a lot with very little interaction and no shelter. So he now thinks that shelter is amazing and that human and friendly dog interaction is great! \n\nChester has never shown any signs of aggression of any kind, including food aggression. He can be fed freely together with other animals.\n\nChester is used to playing with the other dogs on the property. He is well socialized, both with humans and dogs. While I have never seen him interact with a cat, I have no reason to anticipate a problem.\n\n************************************\nADOPTION INFORMATION \n************************************\nI only adopt LOCALLY; San Diego and immediate vicinity. No long distance. Certainly no out of state.\n\nI cannot respond to questions as to whether the animal is available. The minute the animal is adopted, or intended for a specific person, I change the status of the dog to adopted or adoption pending or hold. Please DO NOT contact me asking if the animal is available. If the dog is listed as adoptable, it is available. \n\nA home check and a background check are MANDATORY to be considered. If you are unable or unwilling to consent to these requirements, please do not apply,\n\nPreference will be given to individuals who follow the instructions AND provide complete information for adoption purposes. \n\n1) Please go to our website ( http://aaofus.org/adoption-application.html )\n\n2) submit it online. Must include dog\u2019s name and \u201cforward to Kim\u201d under pet\u2019s name\n\n3) then forward the confirmation email to me directly at animalsandkim@gmail.com\n\nThat\u2019s it: easy Peezy!\n\nYou must Submit an application or at least provide written answers to the following questions in an email in order for me to respond:\n\nMust include information on EVERY person in household\n\nNumber of people in household and their ages ______________________________\n____________________________________________________________\n\noccupations ________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nType of residential dwelling? __________________\n\nAddress:\n__________________\n__________________\n__________________\n\nPhone number:\n__________________\nText available? \n\ndoes anyone in the family suffer from allergies? ___________________\n\nI currently own _____ dogs and _____ cats.\n\ntheir breed(s) and age(s) are as follows: ____________________________________________________________\n\nare you willing to housebreak this pet? ________________\n\nhow will you exercise your pet ______________________\nhow long will your pet be left alone during the day or night _______________\nwhere will your pet sleep ___________________________________________\ndo you have a door that will enable your pet to go in and out of the house freely while he is being house trained?\n\ndo you have a swimming pool ?_________________________________\ndogs frequently dig, chew and bark - are you willing to work with the dog to stop this behavior\nunder what circumstance would you not be able to keep your dog?\n\nPets can live 12 to 15 years.

He is social, loves people, and thinks other dogs are the best playmates he has ever met in his life. He would be an excellent canine companion for another large breed dog. Housetraining is going well and he crates for the workday. Snipe is a young dog who needs lots of exercise and training and needs a home who will make that commitment to him. He is very smart, eager to learn, but until rescue no one ever put in the time to teach him anything. He is about 2 years old, 80 lbs fully grown. He needs a fenced yard for adoption. We will not place him in an apartment setting.\n\nRequirements: Fenced yard.  \n\nAdoption Fee: $475 + tax. This includes neuter/spay, current vaccinations as age appropriate, heartworm/tick testing if appropriate, deworming, microchip, and current preventatives\n\nInterested in adopting?  Fill out a preadopt application here: https://form.jotform.com/203104540557144\n\nYou can email laurahhk9@gmail.com with additional questions.\n\nThis dog is located in Minneapolis, MN\n",

            "description": "Hard to believe but after owning Charlie Brown and his companion canine Leyla, their senior owner asked his daughter to euthanize both dogs because he didn\u2019t want them anymore. Fortunately his daughter cared enough about these two lovable pets to bring them to AALOC.\n\nCharlie Brown is about a 15-pound poodle mix. When he arrived Charlie Brown needed extensive dental care, ultimately losing 17 of his 42 teeth because of decay and neglect. He also had a skin condition that required veterinarian attention. Both of these issues have been addressed and Charlie Brown is now looking for a new home and a forever family. We do recommend an adult only home for Charlie Brown and one without other pets since he likes to be the center of attention.\n\nYou can tell Charlie Brown was loved for a long time. He makes friends easily with other dogs and humans alike. Charlie Brown is a little older but has plenty of love to give in return, and although Charlie Brown has always been with Leyla, he is available as a single dog adoption.\n\nPoodles are one of the most intelligent and trainable dogs. One thing to consider: The coat of a poodle is tight and curly because the hair does not generally shed out. This means that Charlie Brown would need to be groomed regularly, otherwise his fur will mat to itself, a painful condition that can lead to skin problems. \n\nPlease submit an application to adopt Charlie Brown at www.AALOC.org. Once your application is reviewed and approved we will contact you to make an appointment to visit us at AALOC to meet Charlie Brown during visiting hours (10am to 3pm daily) and get to know him a bit.\n\nDonation of $165 for dog adoption includes spay/neuter, vaccinations, and a microchip. Applications require a veterinary reference and home visit (in Orange County, CA). For more information on adoption policies visit our homepage at www.aaloc.org. Contact us by e-mail: aaloc@aaloc.org, or by phone (714) 893-4393.\n",

            "description": "Meet Ramba! This gorgeous girl lost her home in Lake Charles, Louisiana during the devastation of Hurricane Laura. This category 4 hurricane with 140 mph winds caused mass destruction to the area and Ramba\u2019s foster lost her home. Ramba is now safe in Texas with a new foster.\n\nThis Southern Belle can\u2019t wait to relocate to the Pacific Northwest! Ramba is currently in Houston and will arrive in Washington on October 28th and is available for adoption or foster directly off of transport. To apply, please fill out an application at www.doggedly.org/adoption-app\n \nRamba is 55lbs and 3 years old. She is super friendly, outdoorsy, athletic and loves to explore. She would make an amazing running buddy and would love to go on some scenic hikes in nature. This girl is friendly, confident and enjoys the company of humans. Her biggest motivator is praise and affection! This girl is such a people pleaser and wants to constantly be by her human\u2019s side and told that she\u2019s a good girl!\n \nRamba is not only stunning, but she is dog, cat and kid friendly. Ramba enjoys the company of other dogs, but is very independent. She is low key and respectful around other dogs, sniffing them and then paying other dogs no mind. Ramba enjoys the company of other dogs and is extremely pleasant on walks, car rides and social outings, but is very human oriented. She enjoys the company of humans the most and would love to be the only dog in a home to soak up all of your attention! When meeting a cat, Ramba acknowledged and then ignored the cat, glancing up to her human handler for direction. Ramba has excellent recall and was easily redirected, although she was excited to meet the cat. As per any introduction to indoor cars, a controlled, slow introduction should be followed.\n\nRamba is a medium energy dog that is highly intelligent. Beautiful Ramba will require a home that can accommodate her needs both physically and mentally. This girl is a thinker and loves to please her humans. She would thrive in a home environment that would keep her on her toes with plenty of brain games, training and mental enrichment to challenge her. Mental stimulation helps Ramba to relax and she enjoys being given commands to follow. Ramba knows her basic commands such as sit and will sit pretty for a treat! She is a dream on a leash and is perfectly well behaved walking on busy city sidewalks. Not much bothers Ramba! She is also house broken and crate trained, although she doesn\u2019t love to be kenneled for long periods of time alone, probably due to the sudden change of environment after the hurricane. Ramba has adjusted quickly in a new foster home, and being with people has been a huge comfort to her! She much prefers a comfy dog bed with a puzzle toy or bone to keep her busy. Ramba is totally content snuggling up on the couch while hanging out at home, as long as her exercise needs are met! \n",

WE are a high intake No Kill Shelter ran by a staff of 4 and do not always have time to answer every question asked by so many. If you are a good fit for the animal you are interested in -we will call to speak with you, If we feel you are not a good fit , we will contact you about other pets that may be a good fit for your home. Many people are losing the opportunity to adopt the animal they want because they fail to put in an application and the pet was adopted before we could answer your email. .If you have applied for an animal in our facility and have not received a response within 7 days, PLEASE call or contact us again. Though we do our best in trying to answer all emails in a timely manner, sometimes things get away from us, get lost or misplaced. It is never our intention to ignore a request about an adoptable animal in our facility.\n\nSandy Brown, Director, PAW Animal Shelter\n\n319-372-2274",

            "description": "Biffy and Coventry are a bonded pair living in a foster home. Submit an application from our website and then make an appointment to meet them.\n\nBiffy (male) and Coventry (female) are not eligible for foster and will be a straight adoption.\n\nAge: ~8 years\nWeight: Coventry is aboutt 62lbs, Biffy is about 68lbs\nHousebroken: Yes\nCrate trained: They have not been crated, but they have done well with free roam while they have been left solo.\nDog sociability: They love each other and are required to be adopted together. They can sometimes resource guard food from each other, but it is manageable. They haven't had too much interaction with other dogs. \nCat sociability: Unknown\nKids: Friendly! They live with a kid in their foster home and have been doing great. \nIdeal home: Buffy and Coventry are a super sweet senior duo looking for a comfy home that can continue to keep up with their medical needs (explained below). They will take some time to decompress and management may be needed at times between the two dogs, so an adopter who can read dog body language would be great!\n\nBiffy is a true southern gentlemen. His BFF is his sister, Coventry, with whom he has a typical sibling relationship: one minute he's wrestling and playing with her, later he's not happy she's decided to nap in his bed. He is very polite and a wonderful guy all around. Loves people, adults and kids, loves pets and scratches, and attention but isn't constantly demanding. He's always ready to go for a walk, long or short, sidewalk or park and loves walks so much he dances and prances for the first minute or so of being on his leash. He walks right beside you and doesn't lunge or pull. He loves being outside in our yard sleeping in the sun when it's warm and likes to hang out by the front gate where he can people and dog watch. He can be a bit barky at dogs who bark at him first at the fence, but he responds very well to redirection. \n\nCoventry is a sensitive and sweet southern belle who loves her brother and BFF Biffy. She loves to wrestle and run with him but will let him know when he's displeased her by going by her food bowl, or pushing his way in to get pets. Coventry is the braver of the two dogs when trying something new like jumping into and out of the car, or trying out a long staircase. Coventry comes great when called and knows \"go to your bed\" and does so when asked. She also knows \"go to your spot\" in the yard when let out to go to the bathroom. She prefers privacy when she going to the bathroom because she's a real lady. She's a little sensitive to quick moves, loud voices or noises of something being dropped but this is lessening as she decompresses. She is easily walked with Biffy. And she does love her walks, neighborhoods, grassy parks, forest preserves she loves walks of all kinds.She also likes her tennis ball and will retrieve it. She will also throw the ball up in the air and then run after it!\n\nCoventry has kidney disease, and takes daily medication along with a lifelong prescription diet. She will need monitoring bloodwork an estimated 1-2 times per year. She had some issues with incontinence on arrival which have resolved with the medication and food interventions. We recommend her adopter to monitor with regular vet. \n\nBoth Biffy and Coventry tested positive for heartworm disease at their prior shelter and received treatment there. They will need to be on exercise restriction for the next 6 months until they can be retested for heartworm disease. If their 6 month retests comes back positive, OTAT will cover treatment at our Ellis Clinic.\n\nBiffy and Coventry's combined adoption fee is 150. They are each spayed/neutered, up to date on core vaccines, microchipped and heartworm positive. As large breed senior dogs, both Biffy and Coventry have arthritis and are on joint supplements daily. \n\n***We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications. We ask that you please be patient and someone will be in touch via email within 72 hours. Please do not email us unless you have not received a response in 72 hours. Please only fill out one adoption application. ***",

See the bottom of this bio for more FAQs regarding our adoption process before emailing.****\n\nName: Jax\n\nAge: 4 yrs (DOB 11/8/16)\n\nCurrent Weight: 16 lbs\n\nRescued from: Texas\n\nHi, I'm Jax! I used to live with me mom, dad and little brother but my family had to move into an apartment and I tend to bark if I hear anything out of the ordinary, so they couldn't keep me anymore :( I would love to live in a house again so I can run and play in the yard! I am potty trained and know how to use a doggy door. I can be a little shy/timid when I first meet new people or go to new places, but once I warm up I am a little lovebug! I have an independent side and am full of personality! \n\nJax will be arriving at SNARR's Adoption Center in Brewster, NY soon ready for adoption!  His ideal home would include a fenced-in yard, and he does prefer a home without young children or large dogs.\n\nIMPORTANT: This dog has not yet been altered. For any dog or puppy that is not able to be spayed/neutered prior to adoption, SNARR requires a $125 deposit in addition to your adoption fee, as well as a signed Spay/Neuter Contract stating you will have this dog altered within 6 months of adoption. The $125 deposit will be returned once the contract has been fulfilled. \n\nHealth: up to date on required vaccines, will be microchippped upon arrival to NY\n\nAdoption fee: $375\n\nTo apply to adopt Jax, fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. \n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $375 for adults. Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n\n\n",

They\u2019re super sweet and get along with cats and other dogs.   They\u2019re house trained, leash trained, ride the car, and are gentle as a little mouse.  They need an active family who will walk them, take them hiking, etc.  A securely fenced yard is a must due to their beagle noses.  \nThey are indoor pets who love the great outdoors as well as lounging on the couch on a rainy day, They are spayed, vaccinated, microchipped, and on preventatives.   \nApply here to meet these fun gals.\nhttps://forms.gle/i6vCT6447Eew8NCg9",

She's been living in a foster home for the last few months and is ready for the next leg of her journey: a forever home.\nThe ideal home for Kimi would be with one or two adults and no other dogs. A quiet home without a lot of visitors would also be best since she's shy and takes a while to warm up to new people. Kimi did live with cats in her previous home but hasn't been around them since she's been in our care.\nShe's a sweet, snuggly, silly girl who is great in a crate and potty trained.\n3 y/o, 40 pounds, N U G G E T\nDogs: friendly but guards resources so constant management is needed\nCats: lived with cats in previous home\nKids: adult-only home\nFill out an application today!",

Nessa walks well on a leash, is crate trained (at night and when alone in the home), and rides well in the car. She gets easily excited and may jump up on people, so a home with older children would be best. Nessa is fairly quiet, so she would do well in either a home or an apartment. She doesn't like cats!\n\nIf you are interested, complete the\nAdoption Application\non our website at\nwww.NeedyPaws.org\nand we will contact you.\n\nAdopters must live within an hour's drive of St. Louis, MO.\n\nNessa's adoption fee is $250.00, which includes up-to-date vaccinations, heartworm testing and preventative, spay/neuter and microchip.\n\nWe are a 100% foster-based rescue and all of our dogs live in approved foster homes. We are dedicated to finding the best Forever Homes, and will perform home visits and conduct veterinarian and reference checks for each potential adopter.",

            "description": "Bella was found as a stray by a wonderful,  caring person that contacted us. Bella was very sad in the beginning, but is now much healthier and happier. Bella could be around 5 although she acts much younger. She is good with kids, could possibly be housetrained since her rescuer had her in her house some. Bella doesn't particularly care for other dogs, so a home without dogs would be great. She walks on a leash but does pull some. She loves playing in the water!! Especially if you spray her. She runs and jumps, barks and talks to you with that typical boxer conversational yowll. Contact us if you are interested in adopting Bella...\n\nWe are a shelterless Humane Society.  If you are interested in adopting, you can call our hotline, 1-866-304-3352.  This is an answering service.  Your call will be returned when a volunteer gets your message.  This may take up to several hours so please be patient.  For a quicker response to your inquiry, email us, sjjd@bellsouth.net.  This is the direct email address to the Hickman Humane Society adoption coordinator. Microchipping is available for an additional $25.00.",

She can be shy at first, but with continued patience, she eventually comes out of her shell and will not leave your side! As days went on, we began to see her true personality shine through. Morganna is a playful and easygoing girl who is eager to please and loves affection. She can be cautious with other dogs and new people at first, but will warm up if they are just as friendly and playful as her! Morganna gets along great with our two resident pups (a 7-month old and five-year-old, both males), enjoys snuggling, and is doing superbly on walks (with continued practice she will be a great hiking sidekick!).\n\nLoud noises do throw her off a bit so we're unsure how she would do in a household with small children. Morganna is also house trained (we've had no accidents!) and she does OK in her crate, although she prefers roaming freely (and has not exhibited any destructive behaviors or separation anxiety). She is a pure sweetheart and will be an excellent addition to a loving home that will give her the time and patience to come out of her shell and grow into her confident self.",

If you are interested in Gordy please email Karen at kcamaro67@yahoo.com Or call Karen at 619-402-6742 Meet Gordy, This sweet boy was in a horrible situation in TJ Mexico, he was used as a bait dog and treated very badly. His scars will bare the truth, but even if they never go away his spirit has healed. His past is now behind him and now hes longing for a forever home. He's a strong boy that loves to play and go on walks. He can have energy to burn or be by your side on the couch for a netflix night. Gordy is sweet and loving with people, older children and does great with female dogs his size and energy level. He's healthy, housebroken and neutered. We have not tested him with cats. As all dogs Gordy, needs to be intoduced properly with another dog, but within time he's great and playful. Gordy can definitely benefit from a strong handler, obedience training and more leash training. Gordy is about 5 years old, and 50 lbs of love. His adoption fee is $150.00 He's currently in the LaMesa Ca area. Let's help Gordy find a forever home Email Karen at kcamaro67@yahoo.com Or call Karen at 619-402-6742",

We would not place her with children under the age of 14 years and she would do best as the only dog in the home. No couch potatoes need apply, she would be a wonderful hiking partner or agility dog. She is quite clever; however, she would be best in an active home! If Evina is the diamond of your eye, please apply to meet her!",

I'm happy-go-lucky and love to sleep on soft beds with my people. I love to sniff all the sniffs! Walks are my favorite and I often take my time just taking in all the smells.\n\nI'm great with children! I even understand which toys are mine and which are theirs. \n\nI can NOT live with cats. My prey drive is very high, and I will most likely harm them. As far as other doggies go, I can get along with them, but not always. My manners with other dogs aren't the best and they tend to dislike me because of it.\n\nInterested in learning more about me? Email utahadoptions@bestfriends.org!",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Meet Andy! He is a 15lbs Shih Tzu mix with an approximate DOB of May 2013. Its a good thing that Andy is so cute because he does have some troubling behaviors.\n\nAndy was found in the woods completely matted, dirty and starving. He was originally thought to be 10+ years old but the vet said he was a bit younger than that. We may never really know his true age. Due to many years of no real socialization, he is reactive to many things.\n\nTo be very upfront, Andy is very defensive and will bite due to fear. He does not like new people, loud noises and most dogs. This means his adopter needs to be a single person or a couple with no kids and no dogs. He gets along with the current foster's cat by basically ignoring her.\n\nHis foster mom has built trust with Andy since his arrival to Wags in June 2020 and he will now sit on her lap and accept affection from the whole family. Together, Andy and foster mom have been working hard with a trainer. Andy is food motivated, which is great! He now knows how to sit and is becoming less reactive. Andy is easily startled and continues to growl and snap daily. His adopter needs to be willing to learn his triggers (gloved hands, food bowls, etc...) and be able to back away quickly, in order to give him his space.\n\nAndy is a long haired dog that hates being groomed (brushed, cut or bathed). He bites anyone who tries. This means he can not go to the groomers. He must be completely sedated at the vets to be groomed.\n\nAndy also hates the vet. He must be sedated to be examined or treated. He has dry eyes and requires eye drops 3xs a day but will not allow anyone to put them in. Andy had his left eye removed because it was constantly infected even after multiple antibiotic treatments. He is doing fine with just one eye. He will lose the right eye if he does not learn to accept the drops. Andy will take oral medication when it is placed in his food.\n\nOn a more positive note, Andy loves car rides, time outside in fenced yard and being near his foster mom. He would ideally like a home with a yard to run in but it is not a must. He does the most adorable \"happy dance\" when foster mom comes back into the house. Andy has learned to be very affectionate on his terms. Adopter needs to be ready to let Andy take his time adjusting to new home and know that this may be a few month process of ups and downs for all involved. We are hoping there is a special person out there that will provide a home for Andy to live out his days comfortably and take things at his own pace. Interested in adopting this lovable animal? Please go to our website www.wagsmn.org and fill out an Adoption Application. Once the application is processed, a Wags representative will contact you, answer any questions you may have, and set up a time/location for a meet and greet! A home visit is required prior to adoption.\n\nThank you for choosing to adopt!\n\nBreed and temperament determination: Wags & Whiskers Animal Rescue attempts to determine breed and temperament using a combination of looks, information provided to us at intake, and our experience with the animal while in our Rescue. We do not guarantee this determination.",

            "description": "Meet our Charlie Fairstret, a 9-year-old male Boston Terrier, up to date on vaccines, neutered, microchipped and HW negative. Charlie is an owner surrender so we know his history. The owners were changing lifestyle and, unfortunately, Charlie was unable to be part of that.\nHe is a big boy at 33 lbs, robust, playful, crate-trained and totally housebroken. Most notably about Charlie is his strong personality! He is no shrinking violet of a dog that sleeps his life away, not Charlie! He is endearingly quirky, curious, very vocal, headstrong and smart. But he is also sensitive and affectionate. He wants to be where the action is! He is a powerful guy and probably would not be good for small children or frail adults. He will pull on a leash, for example. He does not get along with other dogs or cats, so he needs to be a solo pet. He is fine with humans of various ages and gender.\nHe is good in the car, on walks, at the vet. He is fearful of loud noises. We haven't had a thunderstorm with Charlie around yet, but he doesn't like fireworks and we have been told he is afraid of loud storms.\nCharlie, like many dogs and people, takes a while to get comfortable in a new environment but his unique personality and traits are being revealed more and more every day. If you would like to know more about Charlie, contact his foster mom, Sally, in Augusta, GA at (706)414-7667. Charlie's adoption fee is $250.00 We prefer homes with prior Boston Terrier experience and current pet history. The process always begins with an application found at: www.bostonterriertn.org\nNOTE: Submission of an application and fee does not guarantee adoption of any specific Boston, since that particular dog may have applications pending or may not be the right match for you.\nPlease use the foster momma or dad's contact information above for questions.\nThe process always begins with an application which can be found at The Boston Terrier Rescue of East Tennessee website\nNote that in most cases, we do not adopt to families with small children, e.g., 'under 6,' as a precaution to the child's safety and the dog's safety. In some cases with larger Boston mixes or other dogs, we do make exceptions. Please ask the foster momma.\nWe prefer to place dogs within driving distance of where they are being fostered. If someone from outside the local area is approved for adoption, they must be willing to personally drive/fly to get the dog. The East Coast division (NC/SC/VA/MD/DC) does have special transport capabilties for their kids. Ask them.\nAlso, submission of an application and fee does not guarantee adoption of any specific Boston since that particular dog may have applications pending or may not be the right match for you.",

            "description": "Ali is approximately 4 years old and 68 lbs. Ali is a happy-go-lucky boy that loves to get all the attention.  He enjoys chewing on toys but you will need a lot of stuffed toys as he loves to de-stuff them in record time.  Ali loves to play and is very active. He would do best in a home with older kids as he will unintentionally knock them over.  Are you ready for a big, lovable goof?  Then Ali might just be your boy.\n\nThe adoption fee of $175 includes the spay/neuter, rabies vaccine, distemper/parvo combination vaccine, bordetella vaccine, deworming, heartworm test, heartworm preventative, flea preventative, and a microchip.\n\nTo inquire about this dog, please select the Ask About button; include information about your family, what you are looking for in a dog, and your phone number; and select the Send Email button.  Do NOT call our center. We usually respond via email within 24-48 hours; please check your spam folder if you don't hear from us.\n\nOften there is very little known about our dogs' and puppies' history or even current habits. We are best guessing on breed blends. We can't guarantee there is or isn't a specific breed in their breed blend.\n\nYou can always expect to do training, regardless of whether you adopt a dog or a puppy, including crate training, house training, and basic manners. Expect a 10+ year financial, physical, and emotional commitment to this canine. We provide a variety of materials and resources to assist you with this. All dogs and especially puppies are a lot of work and a long financial commitment. Please research what it means to have a dog and make sure a dog is still going to be an important part of your life in 10-15 years. All dogs and puppies need a lot of patience and guidance.\n\nMost dogs who are in shelters will need an adjustment period after adoption. No matter how nice our shelter is and how much attention they get from our volunteers, it is not a home and they will need time to acclimate and get rid of some nervous energy.",

Weddo is deaf, so he's an excellent road trip companion- he won't care about what music you choose, or notice when you butcher the lyrics! When meeting other dogs in PACC playgroup, Weddo was appropriate and tolerant when greeting the other pups, and was playful and social. Still, we recommend a meet-and-greet for any resident dogs (everyone should meet a potential roommate before going home with them.) He was also reportedly housebroken during a brief adoption. Weddo's hearing impairment doesn't affect his day to life, but he can be easily startled so is looking for a home with no young children who might sneak up on him. Here's what a volunteer had to say about this special boy: Weddo was sound asleep in this kennel despite the usual morning chaos. I was careful not to startle him, but no need to worry. He was friendly, ready to go, leashed easily and marched out the door. We walked around the big lake- a lovely walk- no reaction to other dogs or people. A great way to start a morning! Ask Weddo's volunteer advocate, Gail, about him: foster070204@gmail.com Check out the basic obedience signs he's learning!: tinyurl.com/weddosignals WEDDO IS ENROLLED IN THE GOOD DOG PROJECT AT PACC - Read a message from his case manager here: tinyurl.com/gdpmessage - Ask his case manager about him: rachel.jones@pima.gov",

Dug loves all people and all other dogs - big and small, making him the pick for any household. He's crate trained, housebroken, and loves taking walks. Dug is super smart and knows many commands, and loves to please his people. If you work from home no problem, he's calm and patiently waits for you to finish before curling up for snuggles on the couch. Adopt Dug today and add to your Wolfpack today! \n\nDug is about 7 years old and weighs about 53 pounds.\n\nIf you're interested in meeting Dug, please visit our website to learn about our adoption process and to fill out an application, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs and cats will be micro-chipped, spayed or neutered, and up-to-date on vaccinations at the time of adoption. For more photos of Dug, follow us on Facebook Gateway Pet Guardians and Instagram @gatewaypets ... #gpgDug. \n\nTo view other adoptable pets from our shelter, please visit, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nGateway Pet Guardians is proud to offer a variety of mixed breed dogs available for adoption. However, please keep in mind that we rarely know the genetic background of the animals we rescue and, as such, we cannot guarantee the exact breed combinations found within this dog. However, we do not know his/her actual genetic makeup. Just know that this dog is probably a variety of several different breeds that have combined to create one very amazing and unique animal.",

She was left outside at the vet office door in the middle of the night. Pippin was extremely fearful at first, but is doing great!!!!  House trained, walks on leash, sweet and loves to cuddle and play. Vet said Pippin has some vision limitations, but it sure doesn't hinder her from seeing a raccoon in the yard at night. What an awesome little girl. Has done wonderful with her foster mom.\n\nAdoption fee: $350\n\nAll UnderDogs are spayed/neutered, heartworm checked, microchipped, up to date on vaccines and heartworm/flea/tick preventatives.  For consideration for one or more dogs, we require that an on-line application is filled out.  \n\nTO ADOPT THIS DOG PLEASE FILL OUT AN APPLICATION AT https://underdogrescueofflorida.com/. \n\nSorry, we do not adopt outside of Florida.  Applicants are subject to a home visit, and veterinary references will be checked. Please include a vet reference (including phone number) when applying online.\n\nOur application process:\nFIRST, an application must be approved for adoption from our rescue.\nSECOND, we determine whether the dog that has been applied for is a \"good match\" for the household that wants to adopt him/her.  We take into consideration the dog's activity level, compatibility with other members of the household (human and other pets), etc.\nIf your application has been approved, but the dog you applied for is no longer available, please take the time and look over our adoptable dogs again.  We will make every effort to find the right dog for an approved applicant.\n\nWe hope you agree and understand that our goal to find the best forever home is our #1 priority!

ZETA is currently in our Paws Behind Bars training program to help her \"channel\" her energy and she's doing very well.   She has a strong work ethic and will do best with a family who has the time to work with her physically and mentally.   One of the things she's working on is how to socialize with other dogs and we've seen improvements.   Her play is \"instensive\" and for this reason,  we do not recommend smaller children,  teenagers would be fine.   ZETA is young,  not even a year old so with this good foundations and the proper home fit,  she should be a wonderful companion.    If interested in adopting,  our process begins with the application which can be found at www.adoptmebluegrasspetrescue.com",

            "description": "Blaze is a big puppy that absolutely loves people! He would do best with older children as he will accidently hurt small children. He has no idea how big he is! He has gotten along with all the small dogs he has met, but could hurt them due to his large size and energy level. He gets way to crazy with large dogs and we have not had a lot of success with those introductions. No cats. At this point he seems way too interested in chasing them. He is a very sweet dog that can be a little stubborn and pushy at times, but is very rewarding to work with. He is definitly willing to work for treats! Further work on obedience training would be great for him. He is also crate trained!\n\nIf you are interested in adding Blaze to your family, please go to Tannerspaws.org to fill out an online application.",

            "description": "Lincoln is a 16lb 4 year old chihuahua mix. He was kept pretty isolated most of his life and he's still trying to figure things out.\nHe's super shy at first but warms up after about a few days. He is used to being around other dogs.\nHe is very weary about being around fast moving children and will ignore them as long as they ignore him. He would not do well in a house with a child who wants to get in his face.\nSince he is still getting used to new things he will require a lot of TLC to get him used to his new home, but after that we feel like Lincoln would be a great addition to a household.\nAs his foster parents we have seen a lot of improvement over the month we have had him. We feel like he would continue to get better given even more time.\nAfter the first week in his foster home he has shown he loves belly rubs and attention.\nHe does well with being free-fed and shows no signs of food aggression or resource guarding.\nHe is very shy during meet and greets and stands still in fear while potential adopters meet him, but he lets them pet him, also standing still.\nAdoption fee $400\n\n\nAll UnderDogs are spayed/neutered, heartworm checked, microchipped, up to date on vaccines and heartworm/flea/tick preventatives.  For consideration for one or more dogs, we require that an on-line application is filled out.  \n\nTO ADOPT THIS DOG PLEASE FILL OUT AN APPLICATION AT https://underdogrescueofflorida.com/. \n\nSorry, we do not adopt outside of Florida.  Applicants are subject to a home visit, and veterinary references will be checked. Please include a vet reference (including phone number) when applying online.\n\nOur application process:\nFIRST, an application must be approved for adoption from our rescue.\nSECOND, we determine whether the dog that has been applied for is a \"good match\" for the household that wants to adopt him/her.  We take into consideration the dog's activity level, compatibility with other members of the household (human and other pets), etc.\nIf your application has been approved, but the dog you applied for is no longer available, please take the time and look over our adoptable dogs again.  We will make every effort to find the right dog for an approved applicant.\n\nWe hope you agree and understand that our goal to find the best forever home is our #1 priority!

I'm completely BLIND, but you would never know it because  I get around just fine with my sense of smell. Sometimes I get into trouble because my nose leads me to any and all food left out and I've stolen sandwiches and snacks left behind and ripped open trash bags. I need a human who has had a blind dog before or who has the patience/compassion to learn about what a blind dog needs. Other than being blind, I'm super sweet, affectionate, silly, curious little girl and friendly to all I \"smell\". I've met a cat and was fine with it so I can be with a cat as long as it's fine with me. It's best if I go with older kids ages 12 Yrs + that know how to respect my special needs. I am partially housebroken and do my business both outside and inside on pads. I used to live with another small dog but we had a love/hate relationship and it was best to part ways, but I get lonely every once in a while. That said, I would love to be with another dog to be my \"helper\" dog but it would have to be the \"right\" dog.  I'm very special and an absolute LITTLE GEM and deserve to be the \"apple of someone's eye\" and spoiled rotten. I want to be your co-pilot and go on all your adventures. \n\nFor more info/application - please email: INFO@TAILSOFLOVERESCUE.ORG",

Shine was found very thin. He also had hair loss due to being flea infested. But he has been at the shelter for a few months now and has had plenty of food and treated for fleas. He looks great and you can tell he feels good. He'd be a great exercise partner! This boy would do well with some training and plenty of exercise. Shine is around 2 years old and weighs 50lbs. He's neutered and up to date on shots. Could Shine be the right dog for you? He deserves a chance!\n\nMessage from our dog walkers:\n\nShine is such a joy! Look at his delightfully happy face! Shine loves people, going to walks, and is energetic. If you are looking for a good boy and you have an active household, Shine may very well be the companion you need!\n\n1/27/2021 Shine is healthy and so happy now. He is just a fun-loving, energetic boy. Shines forever home should have a fenced-in yard and he would love to be a part of an active family. To see Shine is to love him - just look at his face! Shine has gained weight and energy, regrown his hair, been neutered, and gone from a very timid boy to this outgoing fellow. If you are looking to add some joy to your life, Shine may be just the pup to make you a fantastic companion!\nJackson County Animal Shelter 86 County Farm Rd, Cottageville, WV 25239 Google map to our location: https://goo.gl/j2faZf Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/JacksonCountyAnimalShelter\nShelter Hours: Mon-Fri 11-4 or by appointment Sat/Sun Closed\n\nAdoption Application: http://form.jotform.us/form/51408614450146 Rescue Application: http://form.jotform.us/form/51744619866165\n\nFor rescue or long distance adoption inquiries, please use this form to contact us: http://form.jotform.us/form/51806042497154\nPhone (for local calls only): 304-372-6064\nRescues and long-distance adopters: We are rescue friendly and PA-licensed!

Duffy is initially shy and cautious of new things, but is willing to try new things, such as her new experience of attending doggy daycare. She thrived hanging out with other confident, playful dogs, so we feel another canine companion would be best for Duffy. Duffy is housebroke and crate trained, rides well in a car and is very willing to learn new things. Duffy trys very hard to be as obedient as possible, which is typical of the breed. Duffy will be forever loyal to her human master. Shes would do best with teen children as young kids, toddlers make her nevous. Duffy is fully vetted and looking for that special someone.",

She's a beautiful girl and well mannered and likes people of all ages. She walks well on the leash and loves to go for walks. She takes treats gently and loves attention given to her by visitors. She was picked up as a stray and no one called or came to the shelter looking for her. She seems to get along with other dogs but is not good with cats. Could Hattie be the right dog for you to walk?\n\nMessage from our dog walkers:\n\nMiss Hattie is wearing her best outfit and is ready for a night out on the town, or maybe that was a soft couch and lap to sleep on!! She is on the smaller side and oh so ready for Santa to lead her forever people to her. Don't let this little girl down - she wants her forever people to find her so she can share her love!\n\n1/27/2021 Miss Hattie is stronger that you would expect for her size. She's a good girl, loves walks, people and treats. She is ready for her forever home and is hoping for a lap or two and a nice soft couch for her naps. She would do better in a home with no cats or around livestock.\nJackson County Animal Shelter 86 County Farm Rd, Cottageville, WV 25239 Google map to our location: https://goo.gl/j2faZf Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/JacksonCountyAnimalShelter\nShelter Hours: Mon-Fri 11-4 or by appointment Sat/Sun Closed\n\nAdoption Application: http://form.jotform.us/form/51408614450146 Rescue Application: http://form.jotform.us/form/51744619866165\n\nFor rescue or long distance adoption inquiries, please use this form to contact us: http://form.jotform.us/form/51806042497154\nPhone (for local calls only): 304-372-6064\nRescues and long-distance adopters: We are rescue friendly and PA-licensed!

He will play fetch (and he actually brings the ball back- most of the time!). He learns routines very well, and will know when it's time for dinner, play, or to go outside. He loves back and belly rubs, and will happily present himself for scratches at just about any time. While he is a senior, you wouldn't know it from the way he plays!\n\nHe is reportedly frightened by brooms, thunder, fireworks, and vacuums. He may be best suited as an only dog, and possibly a family without small children, as he's not familiar with children. \nSarge does have sensitive skin. Treatment/handling of that should be discussed with your veterinarian. \n\nIf you would like to meet this pet, please call 214.509.4378. \n\n***Please note- if you own another dog, we do require meet-and-greets at our facility with your current dog(s) prior to approving the adoption. \n\n***If you rent your home, we require proof of approval for this pet from the landlord/property manager prior to approving the adoption.",

She\u2019s a 7 year old #FrenchBulldog who can be a troublemaker at times, but the biggest lover at the same time. Gracie needs a calm laidback home and only wants love on her own terms- so she\u2019s basically a cat. She loves to lounge around all day and enjoys her daily walks. Gracie Lou loves to play and can be very vocal. \n\nGracie loves to taunt and chase the cat currently in her foster home, but we catch them cuddling on the bed sometimes together. She\u2019s great with other dogs her size or bigger, but can be dog selective and can be an instigator at times. Gracie is 100% potty trained (Will pee when not watched), 100% crate trained and great on a leash. \n\n***ADOPTION REQUIREMENTS: NO EXCEPTIONS***\n*** Gracie needs an experienced dog owner who knows how to handle and work with a reactive dog. We will not adopt her out to a first time pet owner.\n*** Gracie would thrive best with a single owner \n*** Gracie does have a bite history!\n*** Gracie needs consistent structure and must be crated when the owner isn't home. When she is coddled, she take control of the home. She needs an experienced pet owner.\n*** No kids under 18 (No exceptions) so if you\u2019re planning to have kids anytime in the next 6-8 years please don\u2019t waste your time applying.\n*** Gracie can be reactivate when she doesn't get her way. She needs an experienced dog owner who can understand her verbal and nonverbal communication.\n \nAdoption Fee & Medical:\nGracie is currently up for adoption through Lending A Helping Paw Dog Rescue. Her adoption fee is $350 and will include his Distemper, Lepto, Parvo, Bordetella, Rabies, Deworming, Fecal Test, Microchip & her spay. Gracie is heartworm negative, has had her proheart 6 injection and is on flea and tick prevention.\n\nWe kindly ask that you please wait to ask any questions until the phone interview.\n\n***PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE POST & FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS***\n\nWith the Covid-19 Pandemic going on we are still doing adoptions, but  please remember that we are all volunteers and safety comes first.

Our rescue family has accomplished this by setting up each animal and their new families up for success, educating and consulting pet parents about what's in the best interest of their pets overall well-being, and creating an awareness in our community about the vital importance of fully vetting and spaying & neutering their pets.\n \nWhere Can You See The Rest Of Our Pack?\nAll of our adoptable dogs can be found on our Facebook group at:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/LendingAHelpingPaw/\n \nThank you in advance,\nThe Lending A Helping Paw Dog Rescue Family",

Just look at this #Gorgeous, #Smart & #Talented girl right here. Yep that's right! Our baby girl #Micah knows how to #Smile on command ?. This beautiful baby girl is up for adoption through Lending A Helping Paw Dog Rescue. Check out her bio below:\n\nCorky, silly & sweet, ladies & gentleman we're excited to introduce Micah. She's a 4-5 year old #Rottweiler mix. Micah enjoys long walks, spending time with her humans & loves cuddle time. She does okay with other male dogs when properly introduced, but can be selective and it's mainly with female dogs. She's non reactive to cats, but hasn't been up close and interacted with one yet. Micah is now officially 100% crate trained, 100% potty trained & does phenomenal on a leash. We'd recommend no children 10 & under. Although she is great with all people and craves human companionship along with tons of attention, Micah does like her own personal space. She knows all of her basic commands and is just a lover at the end of the day.\n\nAdoption #Requirements: No Exceptions\n- Fenced in Yard Required\n- No kids under the age of 10\n- No Female Dogs\n- Would thrive best as the only dog\nMicah is currently up for adoption through Lending A Helping Paw Dog Rescue. Her adoption fee is $350 & will include her distemper, rabies, bordetella, parvo, & lepto vaccines; deworming; microchip; heartworm test; fecal test & being fixed. Micah is currently on both flea & tick, as well as heartworm prevention. We kindly ask that you please wait until then to ask any questions.\n\n***PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE POST & FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS****\n \nWith the Covid-19 Pandemic going on we are still doing adoptions, but please remember that we are all volunteers and safety comes first. With our rescue being based in the Metro Detroit area, all prospective adopters must live within the state of Michigan (which means No out of state adoptions). Please remember we are not a shelter and are 100% foster based. Once you submit your application, it may take up to 2 weeks for us to get back to you. So please be patient with us.\n\nAgain, we kindly ask that you please read the entire post to answer your questions. If you cannot follow the instructions properly, we will skip your application and move onto the next one. We kindly ask that you save any questions, comments or concerns for the phone interview. We kindly ask the following: No phone calls, No pm's, & No multiple emails- We are all volunteers and promise to get back to you within a timely fashion! \n \nLending A Helping Paw Dog Rescue; previously known as the PRO-PET-OTIC Foundation, is a 100% Foster-Based Rescue that is ran by all Volunteers. Which means that we are not a shelter & each animal is in an actual home with a foster family. We kindly ask that you put any questions within the email & our team of Volunteers will get back to you. With the overwhelming amount of emails please be patient with our 100% volunteer family and we will get back to you. The application MUST BE filled out, a Vet Check MUST BE completed by our team, as well as a phone interview before we do a 'Meet N Greet.'\n \nVet Checks:\nWhen adopting through our rescue, we 'ALWAYS' do a vet check on each applicant's pets that they have owned over the past 10 years. Please make sure to call your vet to grant them permission to release this information to our rescue. That being said, all of the animals in each applicant's home must be UTD on all of their vaccines (DHLPP & Rabies), an UTD Heartworm Test, & currently on both Flea & Tick, as well as Heartworm Prevention. So please make sure that when you are applying that all of your current animals go to the vet that is listed.\n \nHow To Apply:\nIf you're interested in adopting one of our available dogs:\n1. Email LendingaHelpingPaw313@gmail.com with the dogs name as the subject when you ask for the adoption application.\n2. Once you have completed the application, please print it out, fill it out, scan it, & then email it back to LendingAHelpingPaw313@gmail.com. If you do not have a scanner, please take a picture with your phone and we kindly ask that you sent all attachments into one email.\n3. Please make sure to call your vet to grant our organization permission to do a vet check on your current pet.\n4. If you are interested in more than one dog, please list your top 3 choices on the completed application.\n5. Please be honest & truthful on your application. We always do a vet Check. We always do a home visit. And we always have both the prospective families & dogs best interest at heart!\n\nThank you in advance for all of your love & support,\nThe Lending A Helping Paw Dog Rescue Family",

            "description": "Poor Raisin. He'd been taken to the shelter by his owner because he was diagnosed with diabetes. Unfortunately, instead of giving him care, his owner elected to relinquish him. Probably better for Raisin though, since his owner was keeping him outdoors due to incontinence and only feeding him cat food. Raisin came to us extremely underweight and malnourished, but with a tail that shook with delight. It's almost as if he knew he was going to be in the best care; next to a loving forever home. In addition to being diabetic, Raisin is also sight impaired due to cataracts in both eyes. But, like all Pugs with compromised eyes, he mapped out his new digs in no time. This precious doll is sweet and loving! Once he gets to know you, he'll oftentimes follow you around. He enjoys playing with toys and being around other dogs. He's also an awesome walker on leash - despite not seeing much. Don't let his diabetes deter you from adopting this special and loyal friend. He's very good about taking his injections and has come to expected them the two times per day we administer them. Please consider handsome Raisin as your next forever family member. We're sure you won't be disappointed!",

Most of our dogs are from local LA area shelters, we generally have no prior history for them.\nAdoption fees vary between $400 - $500 for puppies 8 weeks - 5 years, $350 6 - 9 years and $300 for dogs over 9 years.

I'm very snuggly and love to spend time cuddling with my people. I prefer to be the only dog in the home, but have gotten along okay with other dogs in the past. Even though I was so weak when I came in and have some arthritis in my back legs, I'm strong now and can run like the wind in short spurts!

            "description": "Are you looking for a handsome fellow to join you on your adventures? Meet Bones, a sweet lab-shepherd mix. Bones came to us from a rescuer in Mexico, where he did not see much of the world. Although he is an easy-going guy in his foster home, he is still shy around new people and unsure of the world outside, like big noises and new places. When he's home, he likes to cuddle with his foster, and play with his canine foster siblings. He is crate trained and loads up easily, with no anxiety or accidents. He likes a good car ride, although sometimes he gets nervous when he reaches the destination if it's not familiar. He will need a family who will be willing to work with him and show him around so he gets used to new places and people. His foster mom reports that he has a ton of potential! He's very lovable and easy to have at home. Because Bones seems to thrive with the company of other dogs, we would like him to go to a home with an existing confident dog. Bones' new home should also be quiet, with a back yard so he can play, relax, and enjoy some quiet time. He would not do well in an apartment situation. Bones is a great size at around 50 pounds, and at 1 year old, he has a lifetime of love and fun to share with his new family. If you are looking for a diamond in the ruff!!, Bones might be your guy. To meet Bones, please fill out an adoption application on the TRD website and an adoption coordinator will be in touch.http://therescueddog.org/dog-adoption-application/",

Introducing her to other dogs should be done slowly she can get super excited meeting new friends and not all dogs are okay with that.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting and/or adopting this baby, please fill out an application. They currently are fixed, up to date on shots, wormings, preventatives and are microchipped. Adoption fee is $188 ($175 Adoption Fee + $13 Lifetime Registration Fee for Microchip), applications can be filled out at this link. https://www.petstablished.com/adoption_form/10167/generic .We cannot guarantee breed or size when full grown.\n\nDue to our current situation, with more great applicants than we have available puppies and young adults, we are no longer accepting applications from people that are over 150 miles away. Exceptions will be made on dogs over the age of 3, special needs dogs and direct referrals from our volunteers.",

            "description": "Get ready to greet the new year, and a wonderful opportunity to meet Miss Ma'am Yuki! She is a gorgeous 1 year old brindle mixer mix with the cutest mis-matched sox on her feet !! This girl is quite interesting from the get-go. Although she is young, she prefers to loaf around and be closest to her humans. She would do best as the only dog in the house and enjoys the company of older kids. She likes to take very short walks, about 1-2x a week, isn't too interested in dog toys, and likes to sleep in bed, like a person. Miss Ma'am Yuki's ideal home would be quieter, with owners home more often than not, even if this were 'pre-Covid' . If she needs to be kenneled for any short period of time-an Impact Crate is strongly recommended by her foster family. Miss Ma'am Yuki really could best be described as part human, and it doesn't get much better than that! If she sounds like the perfect match for you-contact DPA to set up a meet and greet! All Dallas Pets Alive adoptable pets are spayed or neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines upon adoption. The standard minimum donation for dogs over six months to seven years is $200, puppies under six months is $250, dogs eight years and over are $100 unless specified otherwise. You can view all the adoptable pets and fill out an adoption application online on our website at http://dallaspetsalive.org/adopt/adoptable-dogs/ For more information, you can email adopt@dallaspetsalive.org",

He LOVES chew toys, too. You'll know he loves you when he turns on his back so you can pet him for hours. He would thrive on low traffic routes at first so he can continue to get used to the activity around him while on walks. Morris is the most wonderful dog and would thrive in an active, loving home. Morris is sure to make a lucky family so happy! Come by and say 'Hi' and you'll have his tail wagging in no time! Follow his adventures on Instagram @adopt_morris",

I have great house manners but do like to give hugs! I get along well with other dogs and even cats. I also would be fine with respectful kids.  I need a fenced in yard too! I have mastered house and do not require a crate! I am the master of fetch and am a good boy in the car. The stars aligned and I know you are meant for me! Fill out an application today! \n\n\n\nMy adoption fee is $150 and includes my spay/neuter, vaccinations, wellness exam, heartworm test, and microchip! If you're interested in meeting/adopting me, please visit www.rescueonespringfield.com/our-adoption-process/adoption-application/ and fill out the form! We do adopt out of state with vet references and video home check. *Adopter is responsible for coming to get the dog and returning the dog if the adoption does not work out* \n\nDon't forget to LIKE us on Facebook!-www.facebook.com/rescueonespringfield\n\n*Remember, dogs are pack animals. Because of this, Rescue One does not adopt to outdoor-only homes. Pets are family and are not disposable.  Please make sure that you are 100% committed to a pet before considering adding one to your home.",

Saint is selective when choosing his dog friends. He is currently going through some training and would benefit from continuing his training once he finds his forever home. Saint needs a confident handler that can set boundaries and give him structure. His ideal home would have no young kids or cats. This guy loves getting all the pets and loves treats!\n\nSaint is one year old Boxer mix and weighs 53 pounds.\n\nSaint's adoption fee is $200; he is microchipped, up to date on vaccines, and will be neutered prior to finalizing his adoption. Some of our pets are in foster care and not located at the shelter. If you are interested in a specific pet, contact the shelter at (618) 939-7389 to arrange a meeting.\n\nSaint has heartworms and will be starting treatment soon. Saint would greatly benefit from having a quiet home to recuperate in rather than trying to rest in a noisy and stressful shelter environment. If you would like to provide a foster home, or foster-to-adopt home, during Saints heartworm treatment, Helping Strays will provide everything you need; the medical care, crate, food, etc. Foster-to-adopt would be a great way to get to know Saint. Finalizing the adoption would be done once treatment is complete.",

Eclipse would love a back yard to call her own so she can run around and get all her energy out. Eclipse would do best in a home with no other pets or kids. Eclipse has learned how to walk on a treadmill which helps drain her energy. Once she is in a home, she will need training to help guide her and to help her get adjusted into the home. Her previous family said she is a good dog as long as there are no other dogs around.\n\nEclipse is two years old and weighs 45 pounds.\n\nEclipse' adoption fee is $200; she is microchipped, spayed, and up to date on vaccines.

One look into her eyes and you could tell she was enjoying a mystical flight in her favorite fantasy, \u201cYoshi\u2019s Crafted World. For her photo session, she even wore her green bandana as a compliment to her namesake (who is her favorite dinosaur) and whose real name is T. Yoshisaur Munchakoopas. Our Humane Society Yoshi said that she much prefers to be called the foreshortened version of her name. She is a very gentle, quiet as a church mouse, easy-going and respectful canine who appreciates a kind touch from her human friend. You will be charmed and captivated by her golden eyes that shine with her soft, peaceful nature. Yoshi is a sweet, loving canine.",

            "description": "Scooby loves loves loves to swim and play ball. Do you need company in your pool? He loves to lay on the float with you as well. This boy is so special but does have some issues that require a special home. His prey drive issues prevent him from living in a home with cats, small dogs or small children.\n\nScooby had a rough start and missed some socialization skills as a pup. He has not had a stable home until his foster parents fell in love and adopted him. Unfortunately as he settled in, some prey instincts started showing up and for the safety of their other animals (little dogs and cats) they have to rehome him. They will assist with anything he needs and help the transition as much as possible. He is neutered, up to date on all vetting, crate trained, NOT at all destructive and loves to snuggle on the couch with you\nPlease visit our site at http://zoosrezcue.org for more information on how to adopt. Prior to inquiring about our animals, we highly encourage you to fill out an application so that we can better assist you. Please find our application either from our website or at https://service.sheltermanager.com/asmservice?account=jh2202&method=online_form_html&formid=38\n\nWe welcome you to join our Facebook family, so check us out and like us at https://facebook.com/zoosrezcue\n\nPlease be aware that animals requiring out of state transportation from Houston will have an additional $250 transport fee.",

WE ARE HAVING TROUBLE REPLYING TO PETFINDER INQUIRIES. IF THE POSSIBLE ADOPTERS SPEAKING TO THE FOSTER DO NOT WORK OUT, WE WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE APPLICATIONS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE! **\n\nName:  Lady\nGender: Female (spayed)\nAge: 6-7 years\n\nDogs: NO. \nCats: Yes (dog savvy cats, please)\nKids: Yes (dog savvy kids, please)\n\nLady would love to find a family where she can be your Very Good Girl! She loves her people and is happiest when she's hanging out with her humans. A snuggle on the couch, a snooze in the bed, helping you do your yardwork - she would like to be part of it all. Someone home part days, or someone who works from home would be ideal for her. \n\nShe is NOT a fan of other dogs and cannot live with another dog.  She will not be a candidate for doggie park visits and will not do well in a home that has family or friends who visit with their dogs.  If you are looking for a loyal, loving, happy companion who wants to be your One and Only, Lady is your girl!\n\nLady loves to be brushed, making coat maintenance a dream for a Collie person. She's a very affectionate girl who looks at grooming as more time for you to pay attention to her!  Like many Collies, she can be a barker when excited, playing, alerting. Someone used to Collies will understand this and not be too bothered by it.\n\nLady is good with children and will be fine with kids aged 10+. As always with children, it is your responsibility to ensure your kids know the \"doggie rules\" especially with new adoptions, so time and space is given for your new furry family member to settle in.\n\nShe currently lives with cats and for the most part ignores them. She occasionally is more interested, she might chase a cat who runs from her all the time. A dog savvy cat would be fine with Lady.\n\nLeashed walks are right up Lady's ally. She is excellent on-leash but know that other dogs are not her thing, so if you live in a very dog-centric neighbourhood, more time playing in the yard might work best for her.\n\nLady is a lovely little girl who will thrive in a home where she is the apple of your eye. \n\nIf you feel Lady is a good fit for your family/home, please take the time to fully read our adoption process found here: http://www.collierescuenetwork.com/adoptionprocess.html.  Please then fill out the online adoption application found here: https://form.jotform.com/80865656855271\n",

This is going to be my first Christmas, and I really want to celebrate with my very own family! \n\nMy name is Tater Tot, but my friends call me Dak. I\u2019m about 10 months old, and I just graduated from the PAWS program. I\u2019m a good boy, I learned all of the good things there, and I love to play. I would love a home with another playful dog. \n\nEveryone always wants to know what kind of do I am, but your guess is as good as mine. I have awesome ears, my own Batman mask, and a heart of gold- that\u2019s what I know. \n\nDo you want to love me? Fill out an adoption application here: www.viva-nm.org My adoption fee is $250 and that includes all the vet care and training I received in the PAWS program!",

Pound Hounds was able to save her life due to a foster stepping up.\n\nWhile at the shelter he did well with the other dogs and was a shelter favorite amongst the volunteers.\n\nIndia's STATS:\n\nApprox 2 years old\n55 lbs\nHouse trained and wee wee pad trained\nCrate-Trained\nGood with dogs with proper introductions.  \nKids over 13, please\nUTD on vaccinations, spayed and microchipped.\n\nHere is what her foster mom has to say:\n\nIndia is full of love! She loves her favorite humans, and most of all, adventuring in the great outdoors, and nothing lifts a day from good to great like ending it with an India-led ramble through the park. From the minute the door opens, her beaming smile and enthusiastic pulling set the pace. You'll find yourself beaming, too, because the world through India's eyes is so bright and full of possibility. She chooses her friends carefully but once you're in, you're family, and an enthusiastic welcome is always guaranteed. India's a fan of treats and toys and enjoys a game of fetch in the yard or practicing come and sit on command. Once she's all tuckered out (it takes a while!), this affectionate little gal makes a perfect lap warmer, too. If you have a big heart and a taste for adventure, why not take a vacation to a whole new world of light and love without ever leaving home? Ask us about welcoming India into your life today!\n\nIndia: \nI am not one to sit still! I will flourish in a home with someone that will keep me mentally and physically active! I need a home without other animals. I would appreciate slow introductions to new people and places to help me feel safe.",

Approx 2 years old, 50lbs, neutered and heartworm negative.  Current on all vaccines and flea and tick meds.\n\nMany types of hounds are good family dogs and excellent around kids. They're also fairly low-maintenance as far as grooming and other care. Because of their strong nose, hounds can be helpful dogs to have around on a ranch or a farm, and they're also very intelligent.\n\nWhen you bring a hound or hound mix into your home, no two days will be alike. These lively dogs have an abundance of energy that cannot be compared with any other breed of dog. Since most hounds were bred to hunt, they may not get along well with other small animals such as cats, rabbits or rodents. Also secure fencing would be required to keep this active dog at home.\n\nFor more information on this lovable hound, please contact us at: rescuk911inc@yahoo.com\n\nAdoption Application: www.rescuek911.com\nAdoption Donation: $100.00",

            "description": "Hilda is looking for a home with Helga. We're not sure if they're mother/daughter, sisters, or just plain ol' BFFs, but they definitely belong together. Hilda is the more nervous of the two. On her own, it takes a lot more time to win her over. With her bud Helga around, though, she's a lot more brave. She'll approach cautiously to sniff you, and you'll know you're in when she sticks around for neck scratches. Pretty soon, she'll not only let you pet her, but she'll shove her nose under your hand for more when you stop! Together with Helga, Hilda is a lot more confident and playful. They chase each other and explore everything as a pair, always making sure the other is near by. Once you gain their trust, they even try to fit on your lap at the same time. Hilda and Helga are looking for a quiet but active family. They will need to be the only dogs and with children over 12. They need a house with a fenced yard (preferably a privacy fence), so no apartment life for this duo. Do you have space in your home and your heart for two bashful ladies? Come meet Hilda and Helga! Helga and Hilda are Diamond Dogs and will be shown by appointment only. Diamond Dogs are dogs that are currently receiving special training from staff and volunteers through our behavior modification program. If you are interested in learning more about this animal, please fill out an application by clicking here . Be sure to include Helga and Hilda when filling out the survey. After reviewing your application, we will only be reaching out to you if the animal is a good fit for your home.",

When I was rescued from Animal Control, I had heartworm; but I have gone thru heartworm treatment now and am ready to find my forever home.  The Rescue says I\u2019m like a guy that just came out of a bad relationship...I take some time to warm up to people I don't know, but once I am comfortable with you and trust you, I love to give kisses.  Right now, any sudden movements startle me, so I'm not sure I'm ready for children yet.  My favorite toy is my Kong.  No crate...just need a room with a view; I love to watch the world go by. Car rides...sometimes I'm a backseat driver, although I am working on getting better.  I walk great on a leash (except when a squirrel or rabbit shows up).\n\nI'm not a guy for a first time pup owner.  I've been around the block and am pretty smart; someone who has had or is experienced with terriers would be great!  I'm a low key kind of guy; I can get wild for five minutes and then I'm good the rest of the day.  Also, if you leave ANY food out, I will FIND it, and I will EAT it!  Oh, I gained a little weight while I was on bed rest during the heartworm treatment. I am aiming to lose seven pounds (I weigh 42 pounds currently....but more of me to love)!  I'm loyal and will alert you of stranger danger or squirrels when we take a walk.  So let\u2019s get our life together started!\n\n",

She is such a survivor that she gets around just fine!  She is five years old and still not totally trusting of humans.  She will need a very patient angel who wants to make the rest of her life wonderful!  \n\nTo make a meet and greet appointment or for more information, call us at 520-836-0904  We are scheduling all appointments by phone to avoid double booking.  \n\nEffective September 30, our adoption fee is $180 for dogs six months and older ($260 for puppies and $100 for senior dogs) and includes spay/neuter surgery, microchip, rabies, vaccines to date, a free vet check, and a lifetime of love!\n\nCome visit at 15699 W. Aniceto Rd. Casa Grande, AZ 85193.  We are open Wed through Sun, 10 am to 4 pm.\n\nVisit our website: http://www.valleyhumane.net and our Facebook page Valley Humane AZ.",

            "description": "Meet Wilson! Wilson is 2 years old and 62 pounds. He is a standard tri color Purebred Aussie. He is UTD on everything. Heartworm/tick disease negative and current on prevention. \n\nWilson came into rescue with some high value resource guarding behaviors and because of his guarding behaviors Wilson is NOT for a first time dog owner and his adopter will be required to continue his training and be comfortable with his current training methodology, as other methodologies have not been successful.  His perfect person will need to be 100% familiar with dog behavior and body language.  He is Potty/house trained. Sleeps well at night in the bedroom. He loves to be in the bed, on the sofa or in a dog bed. Does well in 6 foot fenced yard. Doesn't try to jump or dig under fence to escape. Goes into kennel when you say \"in\". He stays in the kennel while no one is home and does okay. He does bark a lot while in the kennel because he isn't a fan of being in it and being alone. He does have separation anxiety. He hates being alone. He's very velcro and always craves attention.\n\nHe loves attention, scratches and cuddles. Does great with happy, social, friendly dogs. Plays with dogs well. He's fine with and respects small senior dogs. He is iffy with dominant/alpha dogs. Sometimes shows teeth and growls at dogs who are dominant/alpha. I'd say he needs a home with another friendly/social dog, not a dog that's dominant/alpha. Not cat or child tested but with past issues no children or cats!  Wilson knows a ton of commands and needs to be kept active and mentally stimulated.  Wilson has done some beginner agility and loves it, also he would do great at Rally, obedience, and more! Wilson has never met a stranger! He is fostered in Auburn GA and will need to be adopted local to continue with his training.\n\nIf you think this handsome dude is the right fit for you, please fill out our application:\n\nhttps://www.australianshepherdsfurever.org/adoption-application\n\nAll adoption fees are used for future rescue efforts.",

            "description": "Bella was found as a stray in NYC and brought to the NYCACC (New York City Animal Care Centers - The Municipal City Shelter) in July.  She then was placed on the Euthanasia List due to space issues at the shelter.\n\nWe were able to save her as a very generous woman stepped up to save her life.\n\nBella has had a hard life.  It's obvious from the burn wounds she suffered that have now healed.  They (the Veterinarians) do not know the nature of the burns, but they best guessed them to be chemical in nature.\n\nAge:  Approx. 3\nWeight:  Approx 60\nVaccinated:  Yes\nSpayed\nHousetrained:  Bella is house trained.  She is pretty much on a schedule where she goes out every 3-4 hours.  If she can\u2019t wait in between she will sit at the door to bark to let you know she needs to go out.  \n\nBella is also trained for pee pads because I didn\u2019t really like to take her out in the hot summer while her wound was healing and the sun was scorching. She does not currently use pads and does prefer to be outdoors to do her business.\nGood on leash:  \nKids:  14+\nStrangers:  Yes\nDogs:  Yes\n\nShe does well with dogs.  She wants to constantly rough house but because of her open skin needs boundaries to protect her as she doesn\u2019t have any fur on her back.  She even does well with little dogs and lets them boss her around.  She doesn\u2019t let the big dogs boss her around tho.    \n\nBella would do best in a home with older kids.  She likes to throw her weight around and thinks she is a tiny lap dog. While she does get along with other dogs she would also do best as the only dog for now as she loves to get all the attention.  Bella likes to rough play with other dogs but due to her lacking fur on her back she needs to be extra careful not to scratch her skin on her back.  We hope her fur will grow back but we can not be sure if it will at this time.  \n\nBella needs a home with a big yard and someone who likes to take several walks.  She is full of energy constantly.  If she doesn\u2019t have the ability to walk off her energy she needs lots and lots of toys for stimulation.  She loves her bones, ropes, and really loves to play tug of war with any toy she gets her hands on.  She will want you to play with her all day and sometimes she demands it which is why she needs lots of exercise maybe Someone who likes to hike.  Bella was severely burned and has no fur on her back and again we aren\u2019t sure if it will grow back at this time.  If her fur does not grow back Bella will constantly need to have coats in the winter and sunblock in the summertime.  She also does best wearing small T-shirts to help keep her warm inside and even to protect her from the sun.  She wears a kids size 14/16 and looks great in pink.\n\nBella knows basic commands like sit and stay using words and hand signals.  She is very treat motivated and we are working on her giving paw.  Bella also likes to sleep in the bed snuggled up close.  Bella knows when she is cold and when she wants to get under the covers she will tell you.  If you have a big home with a big yard and like to exercise Bella would love to share a bed with you.  Bella doesn\u2019t care for doggy beds she just chews them to shreds so she does best with a blanket to snuggle but really prefers to sit and lay anywhere her human does.\n",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Nutmeg is a super sweet 2 year old lab mix. She recently had a litter of adorable pups but now that nursing is done and they are on their way home she's ready to find her forever too. She is a STRONG girl and has alot of energy so an active family /owner is ideal. We're also working on boundaries and listening ears\n\nNutmeg loves to run and play but if you sit down it is officially snuggle time and that better include some belly rubs before she rolls off the couch! She is partially house trained but will need a little more help from her forever family. She loves her human and doggy siblings in foster care but plays too rough with cats to live with them.\n\nOur first step is an application which can be filled out at: www.cvrrescue.org\n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $175.00 which helps to cover a portion of the care provided, including: spay/neuter, microchip, heartworm testing, deworming, age appropriate vaccinations: DHLP/P, Bordetella, Rabies, and any medical care received while with CVRR. All animals are on flea/tick and parasite prevention for the duration of foster care.\n\nCVRR is a nonprofit organization, we have no paid staff. Applications are reviewed and processed by our volunteers. Please be patient and understand that it takes an average of 7-14 days to process the applications including reference checks and follow-up questions. You can expedite the process by providing phone and email info for all your references.\n\nOnce your application is approved, we will schedule a meet-and-greet to see if the dog picks you too. If it seems the adoption will be a good match for all, there is an adoption fee and an adoption contract to be signed. The adoption fee helps to cover a portion of the care provided to the animals. By the time of adoption all dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vetting.\n\nCVRR is a NO KILL rescue organization and we have a LIFETIME COMMITMENT to all of our animals. If for any reason the adoption does not work out the animal is to be returned to CVRR. We will re-evaluate and choose a new home based on the best fit for that particular animal.",

Add in her Sharpei wrinkles and this girl is just cute as a button! Nakia is a friendly and social pup who is not afraid of strangers. Heres what her foster home has to say about her: Nakia is the sweetest velvety hippo! She absolutely loves people and just wants to be near you. She knows how to sit, and I've been teaching her touch (she is less interested in learning down or stay) She is very gentle and soft-mouthed when accepting treats. She will sleep in her crate if instructed, but would much prefer to cuddle up next to you on your bed. She enjoys being outside (when there aren't other dogs around) but also loves lounging around in the house. I've had her join a few of my Zoom meetings, and she is a hit!

He is around 75 pounds current on vaccinations, neutered, and on prevention.  \n\nGunner is the biggest goofy love bug of all time! Gunner can be people selective so proper introductions are necessary.  Once he knows you he is your best friend forever! Gunner says his Furever  home would need to have a big fenced yard because he loves to run and be goofy especially when is chilly out! His forever home also needs to be one without children or cats as they cause a lot of commotion that makes him uneasy.   Gunner loves walks and to play tug with anyone that will play with him.  He is very vocal and talks to you when he wants to engage which is super cute.  ? \n\nGunner is currently fostered with his trainer and would need to stay somewhat local to Auburn GA.  Gunner is picky about the dogs he wants to play with so best he was the only dog or a calm female could work in his ideal home.   Gunner has been though a lot in his 4 years and is looking for new positive adventures. Gunner is super active and needs his person to be as well!!!!\n\nIf you think that Gunner is the perfect dog for you, please fill out our application:\nhttps://www.australianshepherdsfurever.org/adoption-application\n\nAll adoption fees are used for future rescue efforts.\n",

While not all are in the immediate area, once we have processed and approved your application, we will move the dog to our adoptive area for you to meet, greet and hopefully adopt. Sometimes we will have more than one application on a dog. That does not mean it automatically goes to another family but you should be aware of the fact that until you are approved and set up for the meet/greet.. the dog could get adopted by another applicant.NOTE- TYSON IS LISTED AS A COURTESY FOR ANOTHER RESCUE ORGANIZATION. PLEASE SEE CONTACT INFO BELOW.\nMeet the handsome, lovable Tyson! Tyson is an 8 year old black lab pitbull mix. His owner died and that same day his owner's girlfriend dumped him in a shelter. He LOVES people and just wants someone to share a couch or bed with. He is an easy going dog. He hates crates which isn't a problem cause there is no reason for him to be crated. Tyson is potty trained and has lovely house manners so your furniture and valuables are safe! He's a big baby that just wants to spend his days with someone to love and care for him...and sleep in their bed. He loves belly rubs and does well with submissive dogs his size or larger. Also children in the home should be over 11yo because he gets nervous around young children. Please consider adopting Tyson! He has many years ahead of him and deserves a home to call his own. Tyson is located in Arnold, MD.\n\nIf you would like to make this gorgeous boy a lifelong member of your family, please email Marliana at 3acresrescue@gmail.com.",

He needs some training and it has helped having him use a special harness.  His previous owner must of thrown the leash at him or something and he bites the lead and plays tug of war.

            "description": "BACKSTORY:\nSometimes people don\u2019t include arrangements in their wills, or other documents, for the care of their pet in the event they pass away. And unfortunately, this was the very case. A 10+ year old boy with stunning good looks landed at an area animal control when his owner passed away and there wasn\u2019t any other family to take him in. Life doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s been easy for him...he\u2019s extremely underweight, there were pressure sores and missing fur, he\u2019s not too stable on his legs, and he\u2019s got a mouth full of rotten & broken teeth. Being stuck in a kennel at animal control is no place for a super senior...they should be lounging on furniture, getting all the pets possible, and surrounded by unconditional love. Well, we were able to make that happen thanks to a selfless foster who has a soft spot like us, for elderly pups. Bernie is looking for a loving home to nap in for the rest of his days.\n\nEDUCATION:\n* Sit\n* House trained\n* Lower energy\n* Superstar on leash\n* Doesn't need to be crated\n \nACTIVITIES THIS CUTIE ENJOYS: \n* Treats: not picky except he won't eat carrots\n* Food: his foster says sausage biscuits?!\n* Toys: a blue nylabone and a white bear he sleeps with\n* Walks: superstar\n* Enjoys affection\n* Loves to sleep\n* Snuggling\n* Belly scratches\n* Wagging his tail all day long\n \nSKILLS:\n* Dogs: friendly\n* Kids: unknown\n* People: friendly\n* Cats: unknown\n\nCHALLENGES:\n* Needs a home with little to no stairs\n* Isn't a fan of the healthy food he's supposed to be eating",

This is a courtesy post, Marlo is being placed privately, not by the shelter.  \n\nIf you are experienced with working dogs and would like to find out more about adopting Marlo please email hopeformarlo@gmail.com   Or visit his facebook page at (cut and paste to your browser):  https://www.facebook.com/Hope-For-Marlo-102251291791995/?view_public_for=102251291791995\n\nMarlo is a very special boy indeed.  We can say with certainty that he isn't the dog for everyone.  In fact, most people wouldn't know how to channel his high drive personality.  But for the right person who understands the trait, Marlo would be the perfect fit!  \n\nYou see a high drive dog needs a job to do.  They have a focused intensity, a desire to work, that makes them overcome all obstacles in pursuit of the goal.  A high drive dog needs plenty of mental and physical stimulation to prevent boredom and to expend their physical energy.  \n\nThis is where the problem lies.  With Marlo in a kennel, he has become frustrated and deeply bored.  He has begun to act out, most notably by being inappropriately mouthy.  With lack of regular stimulation, he gets super worked up when even the smallest amount of stimulation is introduced.  \n\nMarlo is very smart and does follow basic commands.  We are certain that he would excel with an experienced owner that can provide the training, stimulation and consistency needed for a high drive dog.  \n\nA trainer recently assessed Marlo and felt he was just a very smart but frustrated dog who would blossom with the right owner.  A group of dedicated volunteers have been working with him each day and he is doing amazing.  But he needs a home with experience training and working with young, bright and active dog.\n\nWe are committed to trying to find the best permanent placement  for the boy we have all come to love.  If you would like more information please send us an email at hopeformarlo@gmail.com   Do not contact the shelter as he is not available for adoption through them.  This is simply a courtesy post.  \n\n",

            "description": "Marshall is a male Pit Bull mix who was born around September 2018 and weighs 45 pounds.\n\nHe was picked up as a stray in the county and was emaciated and malnourished upon arrival. He weighed just 35 pounds. Thankfully, after recovering in our care he is back to a healthier weight, and he's ready to go to his forever home! Marshall would be a great walking companion - he LOVES going on walks!\n\nThe adoption fee for Marshall is $175. This includes spay/neuter, rabies, distemper, bordatella, flea treatment, worming, testing for heartworms and treatment, and microchiping.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Marshall, please visit the shelter at 22407 Bus Hwy 151 on the outskirts of Monticello during normal business hours which are Tuesday thru Saturday, noon to 6:30pm. If you have any further questions, you can call 319-975-8283.\n\nBREED DISCLAIMER: Many dogs come to us as strays and therefore, we are unsure of their breed. We may actually list a pure bred as a mix because we truly do not know their origins or background and we often must guess at their breed.",

At about two years old, I am still a young girl.\n\n I am energetic and I love to play, run and go on brisk walks. I think I would like to go hiking, but I have ever had the opportunity.   I like to play with other dogs, but my foster siblings are getting up in years and so they are not very interested in playing.\n\n My foster mom says that I can be vocal when I want something. She has taught me some simple commands such as \"sit\" and \"give me your hand\" . I can also do a high 5, but I only do that when I feel in the mood.\n\n My first family put me in a crate a lot because they thought I had too much energy.  Now I tend to get really excited when I finally get to go out and run around. I know I can be calmer when I get to live somewhere where I don't have to be crated so much, but it might take a little bit of time and work for me to learn more polite manners.\n\nI am spayed, vaccinated and up to date on vaccines.",

I used to live on the streets in Houston and had a really hard time and didn't like being alone. I enjoy spending time with people and snuggling up on the couch. I especially like to lay in front of a warm fire when I can. It helps me forget about my cold, lonely days. I can be active but enjoy chilling and watching movies as well. I like kids but I get really excited when they are running around and having fun.  It makes me sad when I knock them down but I never mean to hurt anyone. So, I would prefer the bigger ones!  One of my favorite things is to play with other dogs but sometimes they just don't understand me, and it causes problems.  I much prefer the ladies, they get me! My foster parents have other dogs and I was especially bonded to my friend Lilly that passed a few weeks ago.  She loved snuggling with me, and I have been really sad and missing her a lot.  I am a really sweet boy and I just want a family to love me! So, if you think you can be the home for me, please make my Christmas wishes come true! I have been waiting for you my whole life!\nhttps://petstablished.com/foster_form/11084/generic",

Ozzy was a tad nervous when meeting other dogs in PACC playgroup, and generally kept to himself and explored the play yard. Ozzy is looking for a home without smaller pets, and would like to meet any resident dogs before heading home to make sure it's a good fit. A cozy bed is a must, whether it's his very own or yours!",

Despite a tough beginning, this boy is as happy as can be!  Did I also say smart?  Wicked smart!  He knows all the basics, down, sit, crawl, shake, stay, come... he is a smarty pants!  Goofy's potential is infinite!  He would make a great Canine Good Citizen!  Maybe even an agility guy or Therapy Dog - he could do just about anything as long as he has a family that could just give him a chance!  Goofy LOVES balls and toys of any kind... but we think Nyla or Nylon type would live up to his expectations.  Goofy is fine with other dogs - and loves to romp in the yard with them.  Cats?  We just don't know yet.  Since Goofy is still working on his manners with new people (he is typically so excited he jumps up...) teenage children would be best for him.",

For fostering, vetting and food would be paid for by the rescue.I am a very loving, easy girl. I had an owner I got away from, which was probably best. I am 9 years old and apx 40 pounds. I was covered in fleas with hair loss and my eyes were all gooped up. My back end is arthritic, so I am afraid I don't have much time left. Hopefully, a 2-3years.My owners could not keep up with my vetting. We are living in tough times for people and pets. I have been treated for the fleas and my eyes are good now. I am totally vetted and I have a comfy human bed to sleep on. I feel like a queen, instead of a princess now. I need to be the only dog in the home. I can be a little snarky with certain dogs and will not be nice to them. I am very loyal to my people. I love to be petted and will give a gentle kiss for that. I was raised around children, so I am fine with older, considerate children. I also lived with cats. I would be a great calm, companion to you. I am low maintenance. I feel like a new girl now. I am on pain meds for the hip arthritis(apx $15 a month) and fish oil for my skin and glucosamine for my joints. Like some of us older women, I am incontinent at night. The rescue will pay for my proin, which controls that perfectly. I sure would like my own person to sit next to. I could comfort them and they could pet me. That would be my heart's delight.If you would like to be my new best friend, please fill an ap out below.\n\nIf interested, you can easily fill out an adoption application by clicking here: adoption application\n\nFor anyone viewing this on Petfinder, if you are interested in adopting this animal you will need to go to our website www.rosesrescue.net to fill out the online adoption application. You can usually find more pictures of the animals there too.

            "description": "Get ready for the explosion of personality that is Paxton! This big, exuberant guy has a real zest for life and lots of opinions. He loves, loves, loves to play with toys and will certainly let you know if you're moving too slowly with his favorite thing - the tennis ball! Paxton has clearly had some training as he already seems to know sit, down, paw and speak. Paxton is big and strong and would do best with someone who doesn't mind a lot of enthusiastic dog in their life. He is hilarious, friendly and super playful and should be a lot of fun for his future active family. We estimate Paxton to be around 4 years old and he weighs 83 lbs. \n\nVisit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog to meet playful smarty-pants Paxton!\nDue to COVID-19, CITY DOGS is currently doing adoptions by APPOINTMENT ONLY. Please visit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog to request a meet and greet! \n\nQuestions? Email: citydogs@city.cleveland.oh.us | Call: (216) 664-3476\nVisit: 9203 Detroit Avenue Cleveland, OH 44102\n\nHours:\n10 AM - 3 PM Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday\n10 AM - 6 pm Tuesday & Thursday\n\nFee: $61 | Includes spay/neuter, shots, microchip, license, 30 days free pet insurance (when registered upon adoption)\n\nThe CITY DOGS mission is to increase adoptions from the City Kennel by changing the image of the pit bulls who make up the majority of the kennel population, by preparing all adoptable dogs in the kennel for lives in loving homes and by creating as many opportunities as possible for the public to meet and get to know our dogs for the terrific pets they are meant to be.\n\nOur Adoption Process...\nHere's a little about how things work:\nAll of the CITY DOGS posted for adoption are available for direct adoption from the kennel, unless noted otherwise. You must schedule a meet with a dog in advance - we are not currently accepting walk-ins. Please look online first to see if there are any dogs you think would be a good fit for your home before scheduling a meet. To get the process started, visit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog and fill out the form. One of our adoption counselors will get in touch to schedule and confirm your meet! At the kennel, an adoption counselor will introduce you and your family to the adoptable dogs, share information we know about them, and discuss our suggested ways for successfully integrating a new dog into your home. You are welcome to meet multiple dogs. If the dog you adopt is already fixed, he or she may leave with you that day - otherwise, the dog can go home after receiving the spay or neuter surgery.)\n\nAbout Our Dogs: All available dogs have gone through a behavioral and medical assessment. This assessment is a snapshot of who the dog is at that given time. We cannot make any guarantees with regard to behavior, temperament or health of any City Dog once they are in the home. Most of our dogs are picked up as strays, so we do not know what kind of home environment they were living in (i.e. with kids, other dogs or other cats), nor do we know if most of them are house trained. Everything we know about them is based on volunteer and staff observations. We do have some dogs in foster homes, where they will have more information about how the dog is in a home environment. It is very hard to tell with certainty whether or not a dog will be good with kids, cats or another dog. If you have kids in the home or another dog, we do require that they be present for a meet and greet with the dog you are considering for adoption.\n\nHeath/Vaccinations: Dogs that are adopted directly from the kennel need to go to your personal vet within two weeks of leaving the kennel. All dogs receive their DAPPL, Rabies, and Bordatella vaccines, though you may be required to get follow up boosters. All dogs come microchipped and with a Cuyahoga County license.?  \n\n\n\n \n",

            "description": "MEET ZANDER!!\n\nYou can tell from Zander's picture he is a timid boy. He's almost 2 years old, but appears he might've been a backyard dog. Zander is under socialized and will need an experienced and patient owner who can work on his training and behavior. Upon intake to the shelter Zander was scared and confused, and was seen growling in his kennel when someone got close. After just a couple days he showed some progress with the handler, but is still cautious. When the handler attempted to pet him he quickly turned his head around and his lip curled. He's starting to understand that the handlers will not hurt him, but needs someone to continue showing him that so he can enjoy the rest of his life not in fear! He's already wagging his tail when the handler comes to his kennel, and does bump the handler in the yard, but isn't seeking out attention beyond that yet. He hasn't been interested in the other dogs in the yard. There haven't been any issues, but he hasn't shown interest in them either. If you currently have dogs a meet and greet will be strongly recommended. Because of his timidness and under socialization a home with no children is recommended.\n\nIf you are interested in Zander, please visit our website for our application www.underdogaz.com",

            "description": ",Due to COVID-19, all adoptions will be by appointment only. To adopt, complete our online adoption application and an Adoption Counselor will contact you within 48-hours to schedule your adoption appointment. Adoptions for any pets in foster will be completed offsite at our PetSmart Claiborne location on a case by case basis. The safety of our foster parents and community is of utmost importance to us and it will be at the foster's discretion if they'd like to meet at this time. Thank you for choosing adoption!\n\nMy name is Queenie but I promise I won't brag about it! I have a heart full of gold and can't wait to find my forever home. I love to spend time in the yard playing to get my energy out and am always excited to go on walks as well. Fill out an application and PUT MY NAME ON IT so we can meet and hang out! I am located at the Plaquemines campus.\n\n\n\nTo inquire about an adoptable animal from the Louisiana SPCA, please call 504.368.5191, ext. 150 to speak with an adoption counselor.\nTo see more adoptable animals from the Louisiana SPCA, please go to http://la-spca.org/adopt.\n\n\n\nThe petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n",

Bandit has lived in one home for the past several years, where he did well with another resident dog. He was reportedly housebroken in that home, and slept in his own crate. Bandit is a sensitive boy who struggles in the shelter environment. He can be shy with new people, and will need time to warm up and adjust to his future home. Bandit did well meeting other dogs in PACC playgroup- he was excited to meet new furry friends, and was social and playful. He's an energetic dog who loves to play, play play!

He's loving and friendly with every creature he meets. He's gentle and caring. He wants nothing more than to relax and enjoy his people. He is overweight with several fat lumps, a heart murmur and arthritic but that doesn't dampen his spirits. This guy may have the body of an old man but his soul is as youthful as ever. He enjoys playing but can only do short bursts. He loves to walk, were only up to about a mile give or take depending on the day. He loves car rides and sunshine. He loves a fenced yard but can also wander next to you leashed or free. This lovable Loaf, will require ongoing anti-inflammatory meds and will need to have daily bursts of exercise, nothing to strenuous - tug of war, throw a toy short distance, chase around the ottoman. He doesn't like to lay directly on the ground but sometimes can't jump, so we have several pillows and low beds for him to choose. He sleeps in a crate at night ( I removed the door) so he has a choice. He has not shown any signs of aggression or territorial behavior. He goes outside regularly and has only had one accident in the house. Do you have a retirement home for Marshall?\n\nADOPT MARSHALL!!!! www.LuckyPupRescueSC.com The adoption fee is $250 and we require a vet check and home visit (virtual). Marshall is neutered, chipped current on vaccines and been heartworm tested and is on monthly prevention.",

Carefree, engaging, and adaptive, purple dogs reward a little patience with a lifetime of love  .\n\nIf this dog is posted on Petfinder, then he/she is still available for adoption!  \n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, we changed our adoption process.  Dog adoptions are now by appointment only.  Please submit the PAWS Dog Adoption Application if you are interested in adopting one of our dogs/puppies.

Cash lives every day with enthusiasm, as long as little Juney is by his side.\n\nCash: Blue\n\nThe introverted group, blue dogs need time to adapt as you work to form an everlasting bond together. They are bashful and timid, but if given the opportunity to become comfortable with you they are loyal and loving pets.\n\nIf this dog is posted on Petfinder, then he/she is still available for adoption!  \n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, we changed our adoption process.  Dog adoptions are now by appointment only.  Please submit the PAWS Dog Adoption Application if you are interested in adopting one of our dogs/puppies.

It's ok because they weren't really giving me the attention I needed and I'm ready for someone who can devote alot more TLC to me. I'm a sweet girl but I'm very guarded when I first meet you so you have to go slow...If you go too fast and try to pet me too quickly I will be snarky and snap at you... so I'm NOT GOOD with young children. Older kids ages 12 yrs+ is best. I was rescued along with another small dog and we had a love/hate relationship... the other dog would go after me and that is probably why I'm BLIND in ONE EYE. I hold no grudges and am fine with other dogs in passing...but I think I would be happiest as A SOLO DOG so I can get all the attention. I need someone who is experienced with dogs that can be \"snarky\" and someone that is going to go slow and be patient  & compassionate with me to earn my trust and not be offended if I snap at them for going to fast. If that's you... please send an email to: INFO@TAILSOFLOVERESCUE.ORG for an application.\n\n",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Available Soon!Rosie is a 12 pound, 15 year old Chihuahua mix. Rosie is the definition of cute companion pup! Everyone who meets her loves her. She loves kids and being around groups of people, especially when everyone is petting her. She walks very well on the leash and will keep up during short walks. After walks she will usually want to eat a little food, drink some water, and take a nap. When she sleeps, she makes cute little snoring noises. Rosie has an ADORABLY CUTE, granny howl and will use it if she's lonely/looking for you. For the most part, she sleeps and keeps to herself. She will eat a breakfast AND dinner and has a healthy appetite, but she typically sleeps through breakfast. She may eat a bit too quickly, but a slow feed insert slows her down enough to enjoy her food. She prefers wet and dry food mixed together, and will refuse dry food by itself.\n\nWhen it's warm outside, she prefers to be outdoors soaking up the sun. When it's colder, Rosie loves to lounge around indoors and when she does go outside she enjoys wearing a warm jacket. She is pee-pad trained, but because she cannot see well, it is important to keep things around her in as consistent a place as possible, otherwise she becomes a little confused. Rosie LOVES her bed. It is her safe place and her happy place. She will wander off of it a little bit and will say \"hello\" to you, then make her way back to her place. Rosie also LOVES blankets. One of her most endearing qualities is how she can get herself tucked in underneath a blanket. Every now and then, she will howl because her blanket needs resetting. If you put the blanket on top of her, she will spin around and lay back down. At night, keeping her contained with her pee pads ensures that she can do her business and stay safe.\n\nBecause she doesn't see well, new people can introduce themselves by allowing Rosie to sniff their hand before they pet her. She is also startled by fast moving shadows. Car rides can be challenging, so she does best if she is crated and covered when in the car.\n\nRosie requires little grooming and has learned to stay in the tub when she's getting bathed. She needs to be dried with a hairdryer and prefers low-heat settings. It's also important to clean all areas of her body to prevent skin infections.\n\nPrior to adoption, all dogs are spayed/neutered, tested for heartworm, vaccinated (including rabies, if age appropriate) and microchipped.\n\nAdoption fees for dogs: http://www.svpetproject.org/info/adoption\n\nStay up-to-date on what our dogs are up to by following us on Facebook!\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/svpetproject",

I don't get along with most men, and I need to be the only pet in my new home. \n\nBUT, my friends at Noah's ARC say that I REALLY love my people. Getting brushed is something I love too. I am good walking on a leash and have a good energy.\n\nI know some family could really love me, and I'd love them back.\n\nI sure would love a family to love. Maybe you can help.\n\nDUKE",

This is the bio from his foster: Bull in a china shop is apt for Tonka. He has no personal space & apparently doesn't believe anyone else does! This goes for playing & resting. He's a huge cuddler with people & dogs (he hasn't had a chance with cats). He needs someone who agrees with the idea of a dog sleeping on their bed. He doesn't always stay the whole night, but he does most nights. He takes correction from people and dogs well but that doesn't mean he won't do the corrected behavior again... He is food/treat motivated, so he's learned sit, down, and stay pretty well. He's working on not jumping (\"off\" command) and not mouthing, which he does when he's excited. He rarely jumps on me except when he has a dog friend over. He loves people and most dogs. I don't think he'd do well with submissive dogs; so adult, confident dogs would work best with him. He's fine with small dogs, as long as they don't act scared. He loves playing outside & entertains himself chasing lizards and playing with toys. He likes to counter-surf, and since he does that when I'm not home, I have rearranged things. The longer I have him, the less of that he seems to do. He's laidback, no separation anxiety. He will be good with kids 9 or so and older. He barks appropriately, not excessively. He likes riding in the car.",

Roscoe is a special boy who is searching for a foster home or a forever home!\n\nRoscoe is really a sweet, playful boy who loves people. He loves to run and fetch a rope toy and zoom back and forth with it. He loves to go for walks and is good on a leash and harness, although he can pull some at first. He also likes to ride in the car. He loves his crate and is a very secure in it. Roscoe is a bit of a Houdini when it comes to escaping fences so he will need a home with a secure back yard.\nRoscoe is heartworm positive and will need to undergo treatment which is why he is in urgent need of a foster home. He will need to stay calm during his treatment so a quiet and calm environment would be ideal. Due to past behavioral issues Roscoe will need to go into a home with no other animals or a home with experienced fosters/dog owners who will be able to keep him separate from other pets. \n\n\nTo adopt or foster Roscoe follow the link below. \nwww.bullluvablepaws.org/adopt\nwww.bullluvablepaws.org/foster\n\n",

            "description": "Bernard, aka Bernie, is a 14 year old poodle mix. He was rescued from a shelter in July and had a number of health issues that needed to be addressed. He is doing so much better but he still has a chronic cough that the vets have not been able to resolve. \nIt's clear that Bernie had a loving home for most of his life because he is sooo sweet and loves everyone he meets. He loves to cuddle in your lap, and will bury his head under your hand to let you know he needs a some loving. He naps for most of the day but is still a very lively little guy and gets very excited when its time to go for a walk. He does most of his business outside, immediately, but cannot be 100% trusted to not have an accident in the house so I keep a belly band on him which he does not mind, and its very effective. \nHe gets along with other dogs, and likes to play some, but like most dogs can be territorial when they come near his bed or food. He does not seem interested in cats, so could easily share a home with them. He'd love to have a home where someone is home often to love and care for him during his golden years. \n\nTo set up a meet and greet or inquire about a dog, please first fill out an application at https://savinghoperescue.org/contact. It doesn't obligate you, but it is the first step. We don't get to all of the inquiries but respond to all applications. Thank you for choosing to rescue!",

            "description": "This is Magic!\n\n10-year-old Magic was brought into the Humane Society of Imperial Valley as a stray. He had been adopted from there in 2011 and was microchipped, but his microchip led to dead ends, and he wasn't claimed. So we made Magic a Frosted Face on December 7th, and he is every bit the 100-lbs of love that we hoped he would be!\n\nAt our vet, Magic's labs showed a bit of anemia, and his x-rays showed significant hip arthritis. We got him started on pain medication and antibiotics for his skin. He also has a terrible pressure sore on his elbow that the antibiotics will help.\n\nNothing phases this guy, from kids, to rowdy dogs, to cats. He's too busy looking for his next belly rub!\n\nMagic was chosen for a Frosted Fling for the holidays, and he was such a good boy that it was extended! His Fling Fam is helping him lose weight and giving this sweet hunk lots of love and attention. We received a great update from his Fling Mom: \"\n\nBig news! Magic saw the vet today and he has lost 6 lbs!\n\n(Now 98 lbs)\n\nHe's built up to walking around the whole block (takes 30+ min) and I actually saw him run a few steps this week... chasing a skateboarder!\n\nMagic\n\nstill gets along great with all his Fling brothers, and is even trying to \"play\"... which mostly consists of head butting them while they play bow and jump around and lick his face!\n\nHe loves his crate and knows how to go in on command. That's where he eats, but he likes to lounge around in there (door open) before and after meals too.\n\nWe have closed him in once and he did great, but he's also great loose in the living room while we're away.\n\nMagic is 100% potty trained and has not had a single accident.\n\nHe continues to be a very easy dog who loves napping, cuddles, laying in the sun, eating, being around people (and kids), adventures that involve napping or laying in the sun in a different place (like the park or beach), barking because his brothers are barking, looking deep into your eyes, and just being part of the family.\n\nIn summary, he's basically perfect!\"\n\nAs much as Magic is enjoying his Fling, he would love a forever home of his own. Might it be with you?\n\nApply to meet Magic here:\nwww.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply/\n\nVisit us at Open House: Saturdays & Sundays, 10 am - 1 pm.\n\nLearn more about our programs at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family. No adoption fees, and we help with medical costs!\n\nApply to become a family: www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\nUpdated 1/31/21 KG",

She needs her training polish up. She listens and then she doesn't. It depends on how much fun she is having if she will come as soon as called. If you have a treat I guarantee she will come a running very quickly and straight at you !!!! Again the bull in the china shop thingie.  She does get along with most dogs and doesn't seem interested in cats. An experienced owner with bully breeds and a fenced yard is a must. If you want to laugh the rest of your life come meet miss silly Lilly.",

            "description": "OPERATION HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS!!\nMeet Theo!!! Theo is a beautiful 9 month old Lab mix who is a goofy, high energy boy who would rather play tug than cuddle on the couch. If you're an avid hiker, if you want a jogging buddy with legs that can go miles, Theo might be your dog. He is an avid foodie but has so far remembered to stay off the counter. He loves car rides and other dogs, but would probably be best as an only pet. He can be intense and has no concept of boundaries, so other animals and children will be bowled over. Redirecting him from cats, or getting him to not be so mouthy when roughhousing with other dogs, is probably unrealistic.\nTheo is a bit shy at first and does take some time to warm up.  He is always more interested in toys than he is in meeting other humans.  Other dogs though are his favorite.\nWhen he was returned to us he had some anxiety issues and we have worked through most of it with him.  He has come such a long way since we got him.  He is now doing great but will definitely need structure and continued obedience training to reach his full potential.\nTheo is crate trained and his kennel helps him calm down. When he's out, he's *on*. Since he has trouble regulating himself, he needs external boundaries. He is also an enthusiastic chewer and I recommend toys that *don't* have stuffing unless you'd like a snow effect for the holidays.\nHe is good at Sit and Down, even if he won't hold them long. He tends to pull on the leash but gets better once you really get going. He's gotten the idea of \"Leave It\". \nHe might not be a chill dog, but we are looking for someone who can appreciate his exuberance and energy. Experience with Huskies and other go-go-go breeds is recommended.\nIf interested in adopting please email us at southernpawsrescue@gmail.com for an Application!",

Millie needs to work on her confidence and Randall is just the medicine, now all they need is their forever home!\n\nRandall, 2 1/2 years old.  60lbs.  Very high energy and definitely needs obedience to learn basic manners and leash skills.  A very sweet and loving boy but doesn't know his own strength.  Pre registered obedience classes required.  Loves to play and go on walks.  \n\n8/2020  Sweet Millie is a year old (50lb) Hound mix up from TN looking for her forever home.  She needs to work on her confidence a bit so another dog in the home is a requirement so they can show her the ropes and help her turn into a confident pup.  Fenced in yard required.   Her buddies here at the shelter are Thor and Ranger and she adores them, they have such fun together.  Millie loves to give paw and hugs too.  \n\nThis is a courtesy post for Jersey Shore Animal Center.

Her previous owner got themselves into some trouble and had trouble finding her a place to stay. We decided to look after her for them. However, Sadie is growing restless here and we think it's best that Sadie finds a new home.\n\nSadie is a real sweetheart and likes to be in your company. But she can also be a little independent and likes her quiet time. She's also a bit silly with how she likes to eat her food, as she prefers to not eat from a bowl. She's a bit slower than the young ones, but she still loves to trot around in the yard. Her eyesight is starting to cloud up, but she can get around without any problems. Sadie would prefer a home to herself now that she's gotten accustomed to having her own room. This girl is also a big fan of any treats you give her!\n\nSadie would love to stretch her wings and come home with you! If you'd be interested in meeting Sadie, send us an inquiry or call us at (540)-778-2101!",

The first 4 years of his life were spent living in a crate 24/7. A friend of the family offered to take Sampson in so he didnt have to live like that anymore. After years of having Sampson, this good man lost his home and had no choice but to live in his vehicle. Feeling that Sampson deserved so much more, he reached out for help. He is 12 years young and absolutely LOVES attention! In exchange for your attention he will gift you with a big slobbery kiss! He enjoys going on walks and playing in his water bowl. He is currently being fostered at the Doggie Lodge and the staff there absolutely adore him! He will sometimes have a pee accident overnight in his kennel and he likes to put his blanket in his water bowl after he has overturned it lol. He doesnt seem too interested in toys but that could change once he settles into his new home. In the kennel environment he appears to be dog selective however we do know he has had play dates with a voluteers' dogs and did well, both male and female. Just prior to coming to ODAAT, Sampson who was not neutered at the time, was attacked by another unneutered male dog when a friend brought their female dog over to play. Sampson did not initiate the altercation but did defend himself without causing injuries to the other dog. Sampson IS neutered now. We are willing to entertain a home with another calmer female dog, medium to large in size, who is respectful of space and sharing, however a home where Sampson could be the apple of his adopters eye would also be suitable. He did live with kids ages 3-14 in his prior home, the only issue being that he would take food out of the little ones hands. Due to his age a home with kids 8 and older who are respectful of dogs will be considered. He does great in the car and well on leash. Sampson did exhibit some separation anxiety in the home where he would claw at the door when they left and potty just inside the door. He would do best in a home where someone is home more than they are not, not just during the time of COVID but even after life returns to normal. He did live with cats in his prior home as well and did great. He is your typical laid back boxer just looking for some love in the years he has left and we are devoted to finding him that and more! If you can provide all of the things Sampson needs, please apply at\nwww.onedogatatime.us",

When I'm not snoozin and snoring while getting belly rubs from my favorite people...I LOVE going on walks! My friends at the shelter tell me I am ah-mazing on my leash! Also did I mention that I am potty trained? I guess that makes me pretty smart! At least that's what my friends at the shelter tell me! When I meet new doggo friends I can be selective so I need a slow introduction, and I may do best as the only animal in your home. I don't want to brag...but I have been deemed the ultimate Netflix and chill buddy. Just don't forget to bring the snacks! I LOOOVE snacks! Thin sliced hot dogs are my favorite! Nom Nom! Stop by the shelter and meet me today!",

            "description": "PHOTOS:  Virtually all of our dogs have online PHOTO ALBUMS through SmugMug with LOTS of additional pictures.  Just copy and paste the link below into your browser (or simply type it in) and then search for the dog's \"gallery\" by name\n\n          http://adoptasleddog.smugmug.com\n\nVIDEOS:  In addition to photo albums, almost every dog has a video which will give you a much better \"feel\" for his or her personality.  NOTE:  In the new Petfinder format, it has become quite a bit more difficult to find and to play videos.  Please PAGE THROUGH the photos, looking for a photo overlaid in the center with a \"play\" arrow inside a circle.  This icon is white, so it can be difficult to see. \n In many (most) cases, the video is the last photo displayed as you page through.  Just click on that photo and it will play.  Please make sure you CHECK ON THE PETFINDER VIDEO ICON, above, to see a video of this wonderful dog!  Our videos will include, at a minimum, whatever info we had on the dog upon (or shortly after) his/her arrival into our program.  There will sometimes be video updates as well.  And in every case, our Adoptions Coordinator can be emailed at ADOPTASLEDDOG@AOL.COM to answer questions and provide the most current information we have on the dog.  \n\nNOTES:  Please see video or contact our Adoptions Coordinator at ADOPTASLEDDOG@AOL.COM.\n\nADOPTION DONATION:  $250  Before adoption, all Northern Lights dogs (regardless of whether Petfinder's symbols appear) are spayed or neutered, microchipped, heartworm negative, fully vaccinated and tested/treated for known parasites.\n \nWHAT TO DO IF YOU WANT TO ADOPT THIS DOG:  Email us at ADOPTASLEDDOG@AOL.COM to request an application and get started.  WE DO NOT HAVE AN ONLINE APPLICATION - you will have to request one via email.  We will review your application to determine if there is a good fit between you and/or your family and this dog.  We may suggest another dog or dog(s) if we can offer a better fit in terms of lifestyle, experience, other pets, etc.  A vet check, reference checks, and a home visit will be conducted before an adoption can be considered for approval.  \n \nNORTHERN LIGHTS DOES NOT HAVE A PHYSICAL SHELTER.  We are a nonprofit rescue organization comprised of individuals who open their private homes to foster dogs in need of a second chance..  When fosters are not available, we often pay to board a dog until space is available.  New fosters and donations to pay for boarding are always desperately needed us.  Email us at KATYLIED2@AOL.COM if you are interested in donating or for information on fostering.\n \nFAQ:  For information regarding our organization, as well as adoption policies and practices, please visit our Petfinder Home Page at WWW.NORTHERNLIGHTS.PETFINDER.COM.\n \n \nNOTICE:  In the vast majority of cases, the dogs in our program and rescued from shelters, and Northern Lights has no means by which to collect or verify a dog's history.  We work in concert with our veterinarians, and breed and age estimates are based on a combination of professional input and our collective experience.  Our policy with information acquired prior to acceptance and while the dogs are in our care is that of \"full disclosure\".  It is our goal to ensure the adopter has all available information to ensure the best possible match between the dog and the adopter(s).  If we have identified a behavioral or health condition while the dog is in our care and custody, every effort will be made to correct it prior to adoption, OR the adopter will be made aware of the issue or condition prior to adoption.  Northern Lights' screening process is designed to identify only those adopters who are willing, and have the means, to treat conditions which may occur after adoption, and the adopter will be contractually responsible for doing so. However, Northern Lights' policy is to accept any adopted dog back into the program, at any time, for any reason.\n",

She seems to be mostly deaf but knows some hand signals, also she is fully house trained and hasn't had any accidents inside. She will follow you around everywhere and will literally follow into the bathroom. She loves sleeping on the couch or in your bed. She doesn't do too well with strangers or other dogs, so she'd be best with a household that doesn't see much traffic. But she will LOVE her family once she knows she can trust them.

            "description": "COURTESY POSTING FOR ANIMAL RESCUE ASSISTANCE TEAM TN\n\nMeet Sadie \n\nI\u2019m a 3 yr old spayed American Staffordshire Terrier (with pretty pale Brindle markings). I am heartworm negative, weigh about 80lbs, and I am up to date on my vaccinations. I was brought into ARATT with my friend Gucci who has been kenneled with for the past three years. My family moved away and couldn\u2019t take us with them; and we were left in unkept conditions. I am kind of a chunky gal, so I need somebody to continue to help me with a healthy diet (even though I love treats). I\u2019m pretty laid-back and can be very shy at first; but I smile at you and will wag my tail once I get to know you (you just have to take it slow at first when meeting me). Once I know you\u2019re my person, I will be a Velcro pup and never leave your side. I need to be adopted into a home without cats (I like to chase them) and without other dogs (unless I can be adopted with my buddy Gucci). If you are looking for more than one dog; Gucci and I are the perfect pair (we will be fine if we are separated too though). I am crate trained and almost house trained with minimal accidents (I'm still learning since I've always lived in an outside kennel). I would do best in a home without children or in a home with older kids because I do jump up and get can get over excited. I'm a fast learner and am very food motivated (as you can see from my plump belly).",

            "description": "\"Your love was worth the wait.\" Obie is a handsome 75 lbs Great Pyrenees male. Obie is very shy when first meeting new people, but once he warms up to you, you are his best friend. He requires time to adjust to any new surroundings.\n\nObie was born around June 2019 and was one of many puppies rescued when the Great Pyrenees Rescue Society (GPRS) retrieved a litter of puppies dumped in a rural Texas field. Obie has been living at headquarters, waiting to be adopted into his forever home.\n\nObie would thrive in an all adult family with no other pets. He needs exercise, daily walks or hikes and securely fenced yard to run and play in. Obie needs confident leaders in his family who are familiar with Pyr traits and behavior. If you believe you are the family he has been waiting for, please complete an Adoption Application for Obie.\n\nAll dogs and puppies require VISIBLE fencing\n\nAdoption Fee: $300. (Adoption fee includes spay/neuter, heartworm test, rabies, distemper, parvo and health certificate for travel). Adoption applications can be found on our website at\n\nhttps://www.greatpyreneesrescuesociety.org/\n\nNorthwest adopters pay the cost of transport to independent transport service ($200)\n\nADOPTION, FOSTERING, AND DONATIONS are just some of the ways you can help a rescued dog. We have worked hard to cultivate a large network of volunteers to save this majestic breed. While monetary donations are always much appreciated, you can also help by donating your time as a GPRS foster or volunteer!",

I\u2019m heartworm negative, weigh about 60lbs, and am up to date on my vaccinations. I have been kenneled with my friend Sadie my whole life. I am now in foster care with ARATT. I am learning what it\u2019s like to actually be a dog and have someone care for me. My foster mom says that I am a fast learner; I just had no one to teach me good manners. I do like to jump and because of my size, I don\u2019t realize my strength. I can get rough and get mouthy at play time, but you can give me a toy to help with that. I would be best in a home with no kids due to my energy and size. I\u2019d love someone I can play tug-of-war with and continue teach me what it\u2019s like to be spoiled. I love splashing in my toddler pool in the summer. I\u2019m doing really well on my crate training so that would make it pretty easy for me to learn how to be house trained. I love to go out and explore new things (I'm a super curious boy); so I will require a fenced in back yard. I do really well on a leash and love to go on walks! I think cats are meant for chasing; so my foster mom says I will need a home without cats. I also would need to go into a home with no other dogs (unless you are interested in adopting Sadie and I together) because I still have a lot to learn and I try to be overly dominant with other dogs. I just need to learn my limits and have someone to help me with that. Sadie and I have known each other for the past three years and have been limited to our kennel together. I know that Ms. Sadie is the boss lady! We would do fine adopted separately, but would also make a wonderful pair if you are interested in the both of us!",

Consider one of our Well Seasoned Seniors who are truly wonderful and have so much to offer. Need help finding the best fit? We'll help with that too. Please fill out an application and let's get you all matched up with a loving new \"furever' companion and friend. You'll find the application on the \"Available Dogs\" page.\n\nNOTE:\n\nAdoptions to Central/South Texas residents only\n\nStandard Adoption Fee Adult Dog: $250 ea. Puppy Adoption Fee: $300 ea. Reduced rates for Seniors dogs (10 and up). Reduced rates for pairs (when adopted together). All adoption fees are subject to sales tax per the State of Texas. DDRTX only adopts in Central/South Texas.\n\nEmail: ddrtxinfo@gmail.com Primary Website: www.DDRTX.org\nMeet General Button! General came to DDRTX after being found by a good Samaritan.\n\nHe weighs in at about 5.5 pounds and his estimated age is about 12 years old. Since coming to rescue he's had some major dental work, leaving him with just 2 teeth! He's been neutered and had a tumor removed. Although the tumor was cancerous, it was not malignant. Now that he is neutered, there is a good chance it will not return.\n\nAfter all he's been through, he's the happiest, sweetest little guy! He is house trained and crate trained. He will sleep alone but he sure does love to snuggle in the big bed with his foster mom. He does like to take short walks but due to his age, he gets chauffeured around in his stoller.... which he loves!\n\nHe may be an older guy, but to know him is to love him! If you are interested in giving this little guy a loving home, submit your application today!\n\nLove dachshunds and not ready to adopt or circumstances won't permit having a dog? How about being a sponsor or making a donation. Every one of our dachshunds receives excellent medical care along with day to day food, love and housing. Being non-profit, we rely on generous individuals like yourselves to help save these fur babies. You can do this specifically for one dog with the sponsor button on their webpage or a general donation on our \"How To Help\" page. Easy and quick through Pay Pal or your debit/credit card. You generosity is sincerely appreciated by all and is tax deductable. Need other ideas? You'll find tons of them on the How to Help tab. All contributions are tax deductable.\n\nDiamond Dachshund Rescue of Texas is a non-profit 501(c)(3) volunteer organization with focus on rescue and adoption of pure breed Dachshunds. All dogs are fully vetted and housed on private property. Meetings are scheduled upon adoption approval. Thank you for your continued support to the rescue and shelter communities!\nOpt to Adopt!",

PLEASE READ\n\nPosted animals are physically located at the above address except when indicated with the following notations after the animal's name:\n\nAnimal Name (FC=initials) -- indicates the animal is living in Foster Care. To meet the animal, please contact the foster directly when contact information is provided; otherwise call the shelter at 434 263-7722.\n\nAnimal Name (COURTESY) - this animal is posted as a public courtesy using information provided by the owner. Our shelter does not own or guarantee the information provided by the owner to be complete and accurate. Also, adoption does not involve our shelter but is strictly between the adopter and the owner.\n\nLOOK AT THIS SCRAGGLY VAGABOND NOW!!! UNPOLISHED GEM!UPDATE 1/7/21 per Sigrid:\nFergus (a Pit Bull mix) is @4 years old and weighs 55 pounds. The poor little guy came to us about as scraggly a looking vagabond as you can imagine-skinny, dirty, a moth-eaten looking coat. Without complaint, he dealt with weekly medicated baths and days of isolation, until he was given a clean bill of health by our vet. Now, he has a glimmering black coat, spirit in his eyes, and a happy dog tongue. This boy has gone from hang-dog to Mr. Handsome. He never fails to be delighted to see anyone for any reason. His spirit is one of love and trust. You can tell Fergus wants nothing more than to give his devotion to anyone who will give him half a chance.\nHe keeps his room as clean as he is able and enjoys his bed and soft bedding. He loves chewing a doggie bone and so far has kept his chewing to his chew toys. He is smart, very strong, and lively so he will need a caretaker who can teach him good citizenship and make sure he gets plenty of exercise. Sometimes, he doesn't know his own strength so he might be too much for small children. Fergus shows interest in meeting other dogs but has not been formally introduced to any at the center yet.\nTo reinforce his fun-loving nature, we have learned that Fergus thinks playing Tug-O-War with a rope toy is a blast. He is careful with your hands and will politely give up the win when you want to take the toy away. Besides that, he has become an enthusiast fetch game player and will chase and bring back the rope, then gladly offer you his prize, while he gently leans against your leg and looks up at you with his wasn't-I-a-good-boy-face. How can anyone resist that!\nThis boy is an unpolished gem just waiting to shine. Are you the one who will see the treasure within? VOLUNTEERS and DONATIONS NEEDED.

She is very adorable and huggable, loves baseball, when she can snuggle on the bed, loves to be touched and stroked and lives for treats, especially greenies which is her after-dinner love. She is spayed and was already obedience trained somewhat when we adopted her. We sent her for live-in reinforcement training for two months. She loves company and greets everyone energetically, then calms down immediately. A great guard dog, she informs of any approaching visitors. Fast and agile, she loves her privacy back yard and there chases squirrels, groundhogs, possums, feral cats and is a great mole digger.\n\nHighly intelligent and easily trained, she learns new commands, directions and instructions with one or two lessons. She learned in 45 seconds how to use the dog door insert in sliding glass doors. She taught herself to stop and wait until the nose leash is on the walking side. Figgy loves to ride in the car; however, she needs a little treat to jump in. She did not like our new car, walking around and marking all the tires. For a treat in the back, she forgot the newness and jumped in. She knows when it\u2019s time to go for her two walks a day. She yaps when she needs to go out.\n\nAnyone who accepts Figgy will love her, and she will return that love with great enthusiasm and care. She needs younger people than 80 year olds who can run and play with her energetically.\n\nI am 80 years old and recently widowed. Figgy is highly energetic I do not think she will be good with children since she has not been around any.  Families with teenagers should be avoided since they can be irresponsible and let her out. She needs a family on a farm or with fenced in property who can give her agility exercises, run with her and pay more attention than an 80 year old.\n\nIf you are interested in Figgy, please contact her mom, Mrs. Clemmer Montague with the email link, or call or text at 240-472-9853.\n\nPlease note that we only use PetFinder to list our courtesy dogs.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Marshall County Humane Society is now following CDC guidelines for Covid-19 in order to keep everyone as safe as possible. We are showing dogs and cats to prospective adopters, but only on the grounds outside our shelter. We will need appointment to show the animal and we will want to have social distancing of 6' while you are there and we are wearing masks. We are doing Zoom interviews to see inside of your home since we aren't going into homes for home visit. We do come to your home before finalizing adoption to check the security of your fence if you are adopting a dog. Our dogs are given much care and attention and we treat every medical need of animal once we take them in.\nMCHS is a limited intake adoption center. We are an all volunteer, non-profit organization. All of our animals are disease free, have been spayed/neutered and are up to date on shots. We charge a Dog adoption fee of $125 which includes a microchip. Our Cat adoption fee is $75.00. Most of our dogs will require a fenced yard. To fill out application, go to our website Marshallcountyhumanesociety.org, go to Adoption Info tab and click on Application. For more info, call 662-564-2900. I'm a young Labrador Retriever blend who just needs a new family to love. My estimated date of birth is early 2020. I'm pretty friendly and calm so would be a good family dog. Come and see me soon by calling 662-564-2900 or E-mail DogsNCats11@gmail.com to make an appointment to meet me.\nAll our animals have been spayed or neutered and up to date on all preventives and shots and we are microchipped.

He came in extremely thin with overgrown nails and what appeared to be an injury to his eye. After a thorough vet check and visit to the eye specialist, Mason has a clean bill of health. While he does not have vision in his right eye, it doesn't require removal or any maintenance at this time. The vet did state that should it seem to bother him in the future, eye drops for inflammation could help. Mason is a lovely boy and still learning all the ins and outs of being a house dog. He is finally house and crate trained and thrives on routine. He does need some additional work on leash training as he hasn't mastered that yet. He also jumps up when excited so will need some redirection there but he isn't unmanageable. He would do fine in a home with children who are respectful. He also would love a home with another doggy playmate. Fenced yard required.",

I hadn\u2019t had much socialization before living with my foster mom, so I\u2019m a little weary of people at first, but once I get to know you I\u2019m as loyal as can be. I\u2019ve had to learn how to fend for myself before being rescued, so that can make me a little guarded around some other dogs and my resources, but don\u2019t let that scare you - I just need an owner who will be patient with me and give me a chance to overcome my past. I have so much love to give! I\u2019m really in need of an owner who can give me their love, time, and attention. I\u2019m a herding dog in need of a job. Some training would do me well! I\u2019m already potty trained and crate trained and have so much potential! Some things I enjoy are playing tug of war, squeaky toys, and playing with my foster sister outside. I am very loving, happy, and super cuddly. When my foster mom comes home I always let out a nice big \u201carooo\u201d to let her know how excited I am to see her! I hope you will take a chance on me, I\u2019m looking for my life-long best friend!\n\nBaloo will require a tall (6ft+) privacy fence.",

Cookie is a sweet, playful, well behaved girl who has done well with the other dogs. While Cookie initially did not show a lot of interest in the cats she was briefly introduced to, we have learned Cookie is not cat friendly and will need to be in a cat free home. Cookie seems to do well in a crate. She does jump some, her foster family is working on that with her. Cookie weighs about 54 lbs.\n\nAs a reminder, to be considered for adoption, you must first submit a completed application for approval. Applications will only be accepted if all of the dogs and cats in your home are current on their core vaccinations and they are also already spayed or neutered.

It will not be possible to meet more than one pet during an appointment.\n\nPlease note: at this time we are unable to accept applications or adopt to residents from states other than Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont.\n\nDue to Massachusetts import laws, which are unrelated to the pandemic, we are unable to adopt to MA residents.

            "description": "Hi, my name is Chloe! I'm estimated to be a Lab/Pit/Mastiff mix born around 3/16/2016.  I came up to Wisconsin from Texas and weigh 104 pounds. I'm a chunky girl and would benefit from some extra walks.  I love to say hi to people but hold on because I'll pull my way over to everyone just to say hello.  I was adopted but had to come back because I'm not good with other dogs.  I was excellent in the house though, doing great with pottying outside and I could be trusted loose while alone.  I know several commands and I'm mellow except when other animals are around.  Obedience classes for adult dogs and puppies can be incredibly helpful for both animals and humans. It helps you understand what makes me tick and will give me a better idea of what you want me to do. It\u2019s a win/win and it will also strengthen the bond between us! Apply for me today!\n\nMy adoption fee is $60.00. Adoption applications can be filled out at CCHS or online through our website, www.cchs-petshelter.org. Applications are not first come, first served. All applications will be reviewed by the adoption committee and the home chosen will be the one considered to be the best match. All dogs and puppies have been vaccinated for Distemper and Bordetella, dewormed and microchipped. If old enough, they will be vaccinated for Rabies and blood tested for Heartworm, Lymes, Anaplasmosis and Erlichiosis. Dogs and puppies will be spayed or neutered before adoption.\n\nCCHS is proud to be a No-Kill Humane Society. As a private, non-profit charity, our work depends on donations and volunteers to keep going. We are committed to helping the animals that enter our doors and finding each the best possible forever home. CCHS has been inspected and licensed by the Department of Animal Health - DATCP. Our license is #268235-DS",

She's timid and very submissive with people and other dogs.  \n\n\nLady and one other hound were dumped.  A friend called to say she saw a guy pull over the side of the road, take the dogs collars off and dumped them.  Looks like Lady has just had puppies.  Sadly as rescues we see mom dumped this time of year bc they are bred so their puppies can be sold as Christmas puppies :(  Lady is very skinny, this poor girl was just used for quick cash then discarded like trash.  She is SO sweet and kind...but shy.  You can tell she's not used to living inside the house, but absolutely loves it that she is let inside.  She gets along great with other dogs...big and small and cats.  The family who is fostering her has both dogs and cats and she's done great with everyone.  If you are interested in giving this sweet girl a forever loving home, please submit an application on our site:\n\nwww.dogworldrescue.com/adopt\n\nWe are an all volunteer rescue.  Our adoption fee of $400 is paid directly to the vet's office to help us with the dog's medical bills.",

He is a very sweet boy. He has embraced daily walks and gets excited when he sees his leash.  He loves to cuddle and being petted and will nudge your hand for more.\n\nMax will let you know when its meal time as that is his favorite time of the day.\n\nHe does have some medical issues that require daily medications. That will be an additional cost but he is so worth it.\n\nHe sleeps well thru the nite (currently in an open crate). Max gets along well with our female and respects her.  He seems to be fully housetrained (not one accident so far)\n\nMax so deserves his own forever home who will love & care for him-are you that home?\nBIO:  Max came from a Shelter in north Georgia. We can\u2019t imagine why anyone would turn him in! In just a few words he\u2019s sweet, friendly, and gets along with all dogs. He does like to beg from the table but we don\u2019t give him people food and no one should.  It's not good for him. Our wish list for Max includes:\n  - A fenced yard is a must\n  - Another dog or two to pal around with\n  - Someone that is home a lot to keep him company because he does love his people\n  - No apartments or high-rises\n\nAfter coming into rescue, Max had his gall bladder removed. He has fully recovered and is doing fine without it!  During his initial vet exam, we also found he has a 4/6 heart murmur but no clinical signs of distress.  He is on two meds to help with the blood flow.\n\nMax loves to cuddle with either you or your dog.  He is one of the easiest fosters we've had.\n\nPlease keep in mind that not only will you have the monthly heartworm prevention but you'll also have Vetmedin and Enalapril to purchase each month.  Sadly, Max also has dry eyes so he'll need artificial tears.\n\nDon\u2019t let any of that scare you off... he is a dream to foster! \n\n============== Information for All Dogs/Adopters ==============\n\nIf you have questions about this dog, please feel free to contact the foster home at the email address listed above.  They have the most up-to-date information concerning the dog and would be happy to answer any questions about the animal. \n\nWe welcome out of state and Canadian adoptions, but we will not ship any dog via cargo.  You will have to make arrangements to pick up the dog or for them to go by ground transport.  If you choose transporting by either volunteers through our organization or by paid transporter, there will be an additional $45 fee added for the required Health Certificate. \n\nWe will not adopt into CT, RI, NH, ME, or MA due to strict laws regarding importation of dogs into those states.  If you have an issue with this, you need to take this up with your legislatures.\n\nTo understand the adoption process through AADR, please review the Adoption Information on our home page.  Transportation options are outlined on that page in Step 3.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this Dachshund please review Read Before You Adopt and then you can complete an Application.\n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN A RESCUE.\n\nPlease don't let the distance stand in your way of finding your newest best friend. We have volunteers that will help your \"new friend\" get up and down the East Coast and MidWest. We just can't get them from one Coast to the other but some day we hope to have enough volunteers to do that as well.  For now, please look for dogs on your coast.\n",

He is a very sweet boy. He has embraced daily walks and gets excited when he sees his leash.  He loves to cuddle and being petted and will nudge your hand for more.\n\nMax will let you know when its meal time as that is his favorite time of the day.\n\nHe does have some medical issues that require daily medications. That will be an additional cost but he is so worth it.\n\nHe sleeps well thru the nite (currently in an open crate). Max gets along well with our female and respects her.  He seems to be fully housetrained (not one accident so far)\n\nMax so deserves his own forever home who will love & care for him-are you that home?\n\nBIO:  Max came from a Shelter in north Georgia. We can\u2019t imagine why anyone would turn him in! In just a few words he\u2019s sweet, friendly, and gets along with all dogs. He does like to beg from the table but we don\u2019t give him people food and no one should.  It's not good for him. Our wish list for Max includes:\n  - A fenced yard is a must\n  - Another dog or two to pal around with\n  - Someone that is home a lot to keep him company because he does love his people\n  - No apartments or high-rises\n\nAfter coming into rescue, Max had his gall bladder removed. He has fully recovered and is doing fine without it!  During his initial vet exam, we also found he has a 4/6 heart murmur but no clinical signs of distress.  He is on two meds to help with the blood flow.\n\nMax loves to cuddle with either you or your dog.  He is one of the easiest fosters we've had.\n\nPlease keep in mind that not only will you have the monthly heartworm prevention but you'll also have Vetmedin and Enalapril to purchase each month.  Sadly, Max also has dry eyes so he'll need artificial tears.\n\nDon\u2019t let any of that scare you off... he is a dream to foster! \n\n============== Information for All Dogs/Adopters ==============\n\nIf you have questions about this dog, please feel free to contact the foster home at the email address listed above.  They have the most up-to-date information concerning the dog and would be happy to answer any questions about the animal. \n\nWe welcome out of state and Canadian adoptions, but we will not ship any dog via cargo.  You will have to make arrangements to pick up the dog or for them to go by ground transport.  If you choose transporting by either volunteers through our organization or by paid transporter, there will be an additional $45 fee added for the required Health Certificate. \n\nWe will not adopt into CT, RI, NH, ME, or MA due to strict laws regarding importation of dogs into those states.  If you have an issue with this, you need to take this up with your legislatures.\n\nTo understand the adoption process through AADR, please review the Adoption Information on our home page.  Transportation options are outlined on that page in Step 3.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this Dachshund please review Read Before You Adopt and then you can complete an Application.\n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN A RESCUE.\n\nPlease don't let the distance stand in your way of finding your newest best friend. We have volunteers that will help your \"new friend\" get up and down the East Coast and MidWest. We just can't get them from one Coast to the other but some day we hope to have enough volunteers to do that as well.  For now, please look for dogs on your coast.\n",

            "description": "Meet our sweet special boy Splinter!\n\nSplinter was found on the side of the road by one of our volunteers after being hit by a car. He suffered severe back trauma which rendered him unable to use his back legs or to potty on his own.\n\nAs sad as this sounds, Splinter has not let this dim his shine one single bit ! We fitted him with a fancy wheelchair which he LOVES, he enjoys going on walks and running through the grass just like any dog. He gets around in the house with a drag bag to protect his legs from getting scuffed up and has acclimated quite well to his new normal.\n\nSplinter loves the company of other friendly dogs, he does not enjoy small children so a home with no kids is best for this guy. Hes very shy and will bite when scared so several meets will be required in order for him to trust you enough to perform his care.\nSplinter needs his bladder expressed at least every four hours, so his new family must work from home or be around enough to make sure his needs are met. He will always require this care which is quite simple once you get into a routine. He needs a home that does not have an unfenced pool, or/and access to a doggie door.\n\nSplinter can be slow to warm up to new people but once he trusts you, you instantly become his entire world. He is crate trained but only if his doggie friends are also in their crates. \n\nThis boy is such a sweet love, he does require maintenance, but the love you will receive in return is bigger than his special needs. Splinter is 2-3 years old and has a low to no shedding coat. \nMUST HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH SPECIAL NEEDS DOGS.\n\nPlease visit our website and fill out an application for adoption.\nwww.animalhelpalliance.org",

            "description": "If you say 'happy puppy' enough, it will eventually turn into 'pappy huppy.' We're certain this must be how happy senior pup Emilio earned his nickname of pappy. (Just one look at this 12- to 13-year-old Rattie mix will convince you that it certainly can't refer to 'grand-pappy!') A strapping, handsome fellow weighing 25 lbs., Pappy Emilio has a spring in his step and the youthful enthusiasm of a dog half his age. Maybe his eyesight and hearing aren't quite what they used to be, but he'll have no trouble hearing you call him to dinner or finding his food bowl. Pappy LOVES his meals!! He also loves exploring inside the fenced acreage of his foster home with his nose to the ground, sniffing for any scents to follow. Emilio is pretty low-key and undemanding with one of the sweetest depositions you'll ever encounter. He's house-trained and lets you know when he needs to go out. He gets along with all the animals in his foster home, which includes a 12-lb. Rattie mix, a 70-lb. Rhodesian Ridgeback, three cats, and a parrot! (Occasionally he'll voice a bit of displeasure at the cats if they get too cozy with him when he's not in the mood, but that's the extent of anything even close to grumpiness.) Don't you think adopting our 'pappy huppy' Emilio would be the perfect way to close out the old year and celebrate a new one? See more photos of Emilio at https://imageevent.com/newrattitude/emiliocentralillinois .\nOur adoption fee is $175 for adult dogs or $225 for puppies under 6 months old.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog,\nPLEASE READ THE DETAILED ADOPTION PROCESS information on our website\nat www.\nNewRattitude.org/adopt/\n\nFrom there, you can access our adoption application or contact our Adoption Team for more info.",

            "description": "Welcome to our RMG family.... big NALA! \nNala was surrendered to a N.Ga rescue with her lab mix brother, when the owner had surgery and couldn't care for both anymore. Another group came in to help that smaller group and took the brother but left Nala behind.This kind of stuff just breaks our hearts, because you can't explain to someone what its like to watch a dog mourn for another - until you have seen it first hand. Some other rescue friends tried to see if that rescue would take Nala as well or let them take BOTH to be reunited - but it was a no. So they already have him listed to be adopted and it appears they will never see each other again. So today when she arrived, we told her all was gonna be ok and Coal was ok too- she took a big sigh then walked away and stood at the door to come back inside. We PROMISE she is getting tons of love tonight and is curled up on the sofa! \n\nSince losing her brother and completing heartworm treatment, Nala has decided she would rather be an only child and soak up all of the pampering for herself. After everything she has been through, she most definitely deserves whatever she wants in life so we are looking for a home without other pets for Nala. This 70+ lb girl has plenty of love to give though so her family will not be missing out by only having one pet!\n\nInterested in adopting this sweet, loving girl? Email adrienne@rescuemega.org or fill out an adoption application on our website- www.rmgdogs.org",

He came to the shelter as an owner surrender due to his family no longer being able to care for him. Jake, no Jake is not from State Farm! He is very playful and especially likes his squeaky ball! He knows commands sit, shake and lay down. He needs work on his leash manners as he does pull and jump. He's a big lap dog and an even bigger lover! He loves giving kisses and receiving pets and head scratches! He would do best in a active home where he can exercise during the day and cuddle all night! He is house and crate trained. His favorites are car rides and watching out the window. \n\nHis adoption fee is $150, this includes his neuter, heartworm test, vaccines current, deworming, heartworm/flea prevention and micro chipped. His dog license is also required to be purchased for Sandusky County residents at time of adoption, which is an additional $20.75. \n\nPlease visit the shelter to meet him, we show dogs Monday through Friday 1-4:30pm and Saturday 1-3:30pm. Please note, we do not offer same day adoptions.Come and meet your new best friend today! The Humane Society of Sandusky County is open Monday -Friday 1pm - 5pm and Saturdays from 1pm - 4pm. Also, be sure to check us out on FaceBook!",

He loves those zoomies and especially loves those speedy car rides because he gets to be with his chauffeur person! Colorado loves his humans and wants to be with them all the time, hopefully with his head in their laps or cuddling in bed - he loves naps, too! And he loves walking with them on his leash, just pulling occasionally and easy to correct. At home, this loyal boy also loves playing tug-o-war with his people and is happy to play with his squeaky toys and rawhide bones. He's very food motivated, not picky at all, but doesn't beg at the table. Colorado is an energetic boy that is house-trained with frequent potty breaks. He's working hard on crate-training and learning to be alone - he could use your help! If you'd like to have a new best friend by your side, come meet Colorado. He'll be your most loyal companion ever!",

            "description": "Meet Maggie!\nThis cutie is the first female we\u2019ve had come through in a while. Five months ago Maggie was an unclaimed stray in an out of state shelter. She was brought up here by another area rescue and adopted by a loving home. Unfortunately, due to personal health issues and Maggie\u2019s strength and need for leash training, the adopter has made the difficult decision to rehome Maggie. \n\nMaggie is estimated to be about 4 or 5 years old. She\u2019s a strong girl with a full tail and a healthy prey drive (those dastardly squirrels are so hard to catch!). She\u2019s a little plump right now and could stand to lose about 10 pounds (pot, meet kettle), and has a wonderful calming presence about her.\n\nWhen I met her over the weekend I found a super mellow girl, with a serene, wise, queenlike temperament. As her owner says \u201cshe\u2019s not a hugger,\u201d and Maggie prefers not to be pet by strangers, but her reserve is not based on any fear. She\u2019s just not into new people in general. \n\nShe lay nearby as her owner and I chatted about her and frankly, I found her to be delightfully refreshing. She reminds me of an old fashioned Rottweiler \u2013 aloof, quiet and calm, and just not that into me. At one point she rolled onto her back for a belly rub from mom, wagging her tail beguilingly as she laid there looking at me. It was seriously adorable. Later she came up to me and solicited some attention from me. I scratched her chest and neck in the way I know my girl likes and so did Maggie. I felt privileged that this queen of a dog seemed to like me. \n\nMaggie loves to go for walks, playing in the yard \u2013 a game of fetch and squirrel patrol! \u2013 and chewing on bones. And tummy rubs from mom are the best. Or maybe hot dogs are the best. No, it\u2019s belly rubs. But hot dogs are a close second. \n\nMaggie is a quiet, calm dog in the home, fully house trained and when left alone just snoozes on her bed until you come home. She rides in the car well and is well mannered. She generally walks well on leash but her owner says if she sees a squirrel or bunny she will pull hard, so needs some work there. Other dogs are okay on a case-by-case basis. She has an older Lab (male) she gets along well with, and a small Chihuahua too, but if another dog comes up and gets in her face suddenly she\u2019s not okay with that and will react aggressively. In a nutshell, this is not a dog park dog.\n\nWe don\u2019t have history with children, so no kids under 12. And with her high prey drive, no cats is probably best, since we don\u2019t have any history there either. \n\nApply to adopt Maggie here: https://spdrdogs.org/rescue-referral/how-to-adopt/ \nWashington State \u2013 Seattle area  No interstate adoptions. \n",

He came to us from Coachella shelter where he caught our eye on the video the shelter posted of him playing with other dogs. Once we saw that video we knew we had to save him and his buddies, Dudley, Benny & Jasper.  All three are rock stars but Huxley just has that little something special. \n\nHe\u2019s a big boy weighing approximately 80 pounds of pure love and fun. He is great with other dogs but would do best in a home with another young playful dog medium to large as he does like to play and play and play. We are not looking to place him in a home with young kids as he still hasn\u2019t learned that not everybody wants a hug from him. ?\n\nIf you would like to meet the George Clooney/Brad Pitt of dogs please fill out an application and hope that you get selected because this boy is Aaaamazing!!\nhttps://www.muttsinneed.org/adoption-application.html\n",

He would love a fenced in yard but is being fostered in a home without a fence and loves his daily walks.\u00a0\n\nHe is a boxer/lab mix and\u00a0full of love! Goldberg recently went to Hollywood Feed to pick up some new treats and was the perfect gentleman with everyone he met!\n\nIf you would like to meet Goldberg, you can apply at www.happidogrescue.com.",

She is nervous around new people and accepts women quicker than men. If someone would give her a chance, they will find an incredibly loyal companion. But this will take time and patience.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t respond to commands, but she takes treats gently and appreciatively from your fingers. We think she\u2019d do best as the one and only dog in the home, or possibly with a large male with an experienced handler.\n\nShe is healthy, spayed, vaccinated, heartworm-tested and microchipped. \n\nHer adoption fee of $250 benefits the Famous Fido Rescue.\n\nTo meet and possibly adopt Daisy, please fill out the application for adoption at https://famousfidorescue.org/dog-adoption-application/\n\nAnd follow up on your application by e-mailing Tina at tinasells@yahoo.com to set up an appointment to meet Daisy. \n\nShe is currently at the Famous Fido Shelter at 3124 W. Irving Park in Chicago, Illinois. After three years it\u2019s time for Daisy to finally find her loving home.\n\n",

This senior girl deserves a good life where she can be the life of the party surrounded by loved ones.

Scotty is with our friends in Louisiana but will be coming to NJ once we find a foster or adopter. Scotty will require an experienced foster or adopter as he needs some work on his leash reactivity (he is reactive to other dogs on leash). He lives with several other dogs and cats in a foster home and does well with most dogs. He does not always do well with large male dogs. He is an excellent listener and responds very well to training. Scotty also loves to run/jog. We recommend his new owner take him for training. He has been fixed, he is up to date on vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative. His adoption fee is $400.\n\nHow to Adopt Me!\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about me, and possibly making me part of your family, please go to wagoninn.rescuegroups.org. Click on the orange Online Adoption Application button to fill out an application. A Wag On Inn volunteer will be in touch soon!",

He is generally sweet with people, enjoying hanging out with you and asking for all your attention (no young children please).  Around other dogs suave Bruno Mars is definitely a ladies man. He meets female dogs both on and off leash with a wagging tail, but can stiffen up around other males.  When he's admonished, he just walks away from them...and then comes up to people. He is so looking for a home of his own.\n\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website!

EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY:  Meetings at our Adoption Center are by appointment only (no walk-ins).  An online adoption application is required and must be approved prior to meeting any animals.  Adoption appointments are set up by email by our Adoption Coordinator (no phone calls, please).  This process ensures our dedicated time to the animals in our care, as well as full attention to adopters at scheduled times.  \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

He is house trained, crate trained, and has basic commands including: sit, paw, other paw, lay down, load up, and he half way knows roll over and jump up to get a treat. He needs an extremely experienced owner of either huskies or chows or both. He is crazy smart and does not respond at all to negative reinforcement. He needs positive reinforcement, consistency, and patience. Maui likes to play fetch, go swimming, and do his tricks for treats. He is not good with chickens and is not recommended for homes with children because he is very protective of his people and home and would not do well with children visitors. Maui is very vocal and is not recommended for apartment living. He does well with dogs after a proper intro and likes to play chase and wrestle. He does ok with cats as long as they don't run from him and they let him sniff them all over, however it would probably be best if he was in a home without cats. Maui needs a lot of physical and mental enrichment and does not do well if he has to be crated for long periods of time on a regular basis. He does tend to bond to one person in the house, and seems to prefer the more masculine one in the home.",

EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY:  Meetings at our Adoption Center are by appointment only (no walk-ins).  An online adoption application is required and must be approved prior to meeting any animals.  Adoption appointments are set up by email by our Adoption Coordinator (no phone calls, please).  This process ensures our dedicated time to the animals in our care, as well as full attention to adopters at scheduled times.  \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

Nena was rescued off the beach in Arroyo \nPuerto Rico with her 3 puppies who are already adopted to their forever families. Nena is being fostered with her son in Marshfield MA.\nNena is 2 years old, 40 pounds, fully vetted and microchipped.\n6 days after arriving to Massachusetts, Nena was startled by a nail gun in her fosters backyard and jumped their wildlife cage and soared over the 6 foot fence. We couldn\u2019t believe it, this had never happened before. \nNena was missing 53 days and traveled about 75 miles through that time before being caught by Missing Dogs Massachusetts. Other than a broken toenail, she was a-ok. Due to this incident we are requesting a 6 foot fence at Nena\u2019s new home. A visit will be required to inspect any gaps or hazards. Nena loves other dogs so will require at least one dog brother or sister. While she is more comfortable with woman she warms up to men slowly and is now walking on leash with her foster family. Nena does have a GPS collar and we will be looking for her adoptive family to provide proof of her next yearly subscription when the time comes.\nNena loves playing with other dogs, lounging in bed with constant belly rubs from foster mom and ripping her stuffed animals apart. Nena will be nervous for the first few days but is a wonderful sweet dog that will provide years of love and happiness.\nOur adoption application can be found on our website on the available dogs page.\nThank you!",

            "description": "Zeus came to us as a stray that was never claimed. He is around 75 pounds and has a lot of power behind him, and he has lots of energy. We believe Zeus was born in July of 2018 and will need an experienced dog owner. He is a very happy go lucky and playful guy, but he can be a bit selective about people from time to time. He also will need to work on resource guarding as he can get defensive about having toys, or treats taken from him. He would do best as the only animal in the home with adults only. \n\nAll pets adopted from the Humane Society of Freeborn County will have age appropriate vaccinations, testing, alterations and micro chips included in their adoption fee! Fill out an app at www.freeborncountyhs.org. \n\nWe do allow home trials with our dogs or cats to approved applicants. This is how we make sure your new family member is the perfect fit. We ask that you allow at least a month for your new pet to adjust to their new home. They will need that time to decompress. During this time we will provide counseling to ensure a successful transition.\n\nPlease review the basic adoption requirements listed on our site before applying. We take finding the right homes for our critters very seriously as they deserve nothing but the best! Please allow a week for applications to be processed.\nIf listed as (Currently in Foster) - these pets are not at our facility but are in foster care homes. They are available for adoption. Meet and greets are available with approved applicants only. \n\nIf you have any questions feel free to send us an email at freeborncohumanesociety@gmail.com. Don't forget to check us out on Facebook!",

I weigh 86 lbs. I will be neutered on 12/12/2020 and I'm up to date on all my shots. I had heartworm but I was treated and now I'm done with all my treatments and I'm feeling great!\n\nI am house trained and crate trained. I do have one bad habit, and that is that I'm dog selective, so I should go into a home with no other pets. On the other hand, I am a big love bug! I love to cuddle and be with my humans. I love walking, and my foster Moms says that I'm a fantastic walker. I like car rides too! I'm an easy going kinda guy!\n\nI am a big boy, 86 lbs, so I should go into a home that  has no small children, bigger kids are okay, because I love to jump up and get a huge hug from my humans.\n\nI was tied to the shelter door and I had heartworm too. I'm a really good boy looking for a home where I can call my own again. Can you be that new home for me? \n\nAll applicants must fill out an online application ... please use this link for the application (copy and paste link) ... https://form.jotform.com/91658148530158\n\nThe adoption fee is $500.00 \nIf interested, call Robbi Lee Roy at 860-816-0176\nLocated in Windham CT",

            "description": "Maple is a precious puppy who is a part of a litter of 5 that were all saved from a local kill shelter. Their estimated date of birth is 8/13/20. At 3.5 months old, Maple currently weighs 25 pounds and has a gorgeous, shiny black coat with a bit of white on her nose, chin, chest and belly. Friendly & sweet, Maple loves everyone she meets. She is used to being crated at night and playing in a safe, fenced yard during the day with other dogs. Maple is fine with the other pups here and should be fine with cats and other animals if introduced as a puppy. Maple is crate trained, sleeps on a big orthopedic bed and has lots of toys and a fluffy bed in her crate that she does not chew. She is now fully vetted and ready for her forever home. Maple's wish list consists of an inside forever home with a big fenced yard for playtime, a home with lots of toys and another doggy friend for play time and pet parents who understand the time commitment that a puppy requires. Adopters who are retired or work-from-home parents are ideal as they have the time to spend with the pet. Adopters committed to doing a 6 week basic obedience class to ensure Maple's continued success at being a good canine citizen would also a plus. If you think you have the perfect home for Maple, contact us at info.caresga@gmail.com for an adoption application. We adopt up north and all over so please ask for details. $400 adoption fee and a vet reference is required to ensure a great home (this means you have had a pet so we can call to verify their level of care). Eligibility for adoption means your current or past pets are spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccines and on monthly heartworm and flea prevention. Please be aware that we do not allow shock collars (ie underground fences) or \"pens\" as an alternative for a fenced yard.\n\nWe do our best to place our rescue pets in the very best homes. Please be aware that we have an application which also includes required vet records showing your existing pets are current on preventative medical care. Puppy adopters please take note that we generally try to place our puppies into homes where at least one parent is retired/stay at home/works from home to ensure the puppy gets enough attention and training (puppies cannot hold it all day in a crate) so please have a plan ready when contacting us. For safety reasons, we try not to place small dogs or puppies in families with children under 5 (there may be exceptions depending on situation).\n\nTypical adoption fees for puppies are $350, juvenile dogs $300, adults dogs are $250, senior dogs are $150. Some pets, smaller dogs for example, may have a higher than normal adoption fee but we will alert you if there is a variance. Dogs rescued from China always have a higher adoption fee. Adoption fees help our group offset PART of the cost of rescuing, rehabilitating, and getting the pet healthy so they can go on to find a loving home with someone willing to give them a second chance at life. This amount includes each animal being current on age appropriate vaccinations including DHPPL, bordetella, influenza, rabies, and boosters when appropriate. De-wormed for any internal parasites (round worms, hook worms, tape worms and whipworms) with Drontal Plus, 4DX tested heart-worm negative (if positive, they are treated), tested negative for tick borne diseases, spayed/neutered, implanted with a micro-chip and have been examined by a veterinarian to certify that they are healthy. Any other known health issues are treated as well prior to adoption (examples: UTI, broken bones, contagious infections, dental cleanings, etc). All animals are also on a regime of flea and heartworm medication every month. Lifetime registration for the micro-chip is included in each adoption fee. In addition, each adopter will go home with a fitted collar, tags, a bag of dog food the pet has been on, copies of all vet history, and an adoption kit filled with valuable information and coupons as well as other various treats or toys as promotions become available. All puppy adoptions include two puppy training books, the Puppy Primer & Way To Go by Patricia McConnell, and all adult adoptions go home with Love Has No Age Limit by Patricia McConnell to help ensure a smooth transition for your new family member.\n\nWe ask that you consider an additional donation on top of this pet's adoption fee. This money will go directly into our Adoption Fund to be used exclusively for rescuing and caring for other pets in need. Many pets we take in have very high vet bills to get them healthy and adoptable for the public - much higher than their adoption fees. We receive no government funding and rely solely on donations from our community and caring adopters to continue our rescue efforts!",

Adopter should live within one hour of Tampa.Boscoe is looking for his forever home as an only dog. He is very affectionate and will develop a strong attachment to his adopter. He is looking for an experienced female adopter because he feels his role is to protect her and will resource guard her against others. He enjoys daily walks and tearing through the house with his stuffed hedgehog. He loves belly rubs and will cuddle up by your feet to show you that he loves you. Boscoe does have some separation anxiety, so ideally, the adopter should be retired or work from home. Boscoe is very grateful for all the people who have loved and cared for him throughout his rescue journey.

            "description": "Caroline came to us as part of a litter of 6 week old puppies from a kill shelter. We held her back from being adopted because she was showing some rear lameness issues. After several exams including radiographs it was determined that it was probably panosteitis which is self limited (growing pains that goes away on its own). Caroline is currently 48 pounds at 11 months old (DOB 11/13/19) which is probably her adult weight (she could actually stand to lose a few pounds). She has a gorgeous black & tan coat, walks well on a leash and is crate trained, In addition she does very well in the house - she is house trained and doesn't chew. Caroline is playful, adores toys and enjoys playing in a fenced yard. Caroline is a sweet girl and loves attention. Caroline can be particular about dogs when first meeting them but is okay with several of our dogs here. However she was adopted once and returned for \"growling\" at their other dog (we feel she wasn't given enough time to acclimate before returning) so she may be better suited as an only dog or in a home with an older bigger dog that she likes. Caroline is treat motivated and already knows sit & down. She is a precious pup who deserves the very best home. Caroline's wish list consists of an inside forever home with a big fenced yard for playtime, a home with lots of toys and pet parents who understand the time commitment that a dog requires. Adopters who are retired or work-from-home parents are ideal as they have the time to spend with the pet. Adopters committed to doing a 6 week basic obedience class to ensure Caroline's successful education would also a plus. If you think you have the perfect home for Caroline, contact us at info.caresga@gmail.com for an adoption application. We adopt up north and all over so please ask for details. $300 adoption fee and a vet reference is required to ensure a great home (this means you have had a pet so we can call to verify their level of care). Eligibility for adoption means your current or past pets are spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccines and on monthly heartworm and flea prevention. Please be aware that we do not allow shock collars (ie underground fences) or \"pens\" as an alternative for a fenced yard.\n\nWe do our best to place our rescue pets in the very best homes. Please be aware that we have an application which also includes required vet records showing your existing pets are current on preventative medical care. Puppy adopters please take note that we generally try to place our puppies into homes where at least one parent is retired/stay at home/works from home to ensure the puppy gets enough attention and training (puppies cannot hold it all day in a crate) so please have a plan ready when contacting us. For safety reasons, we try not to place small dogs or puppies in families with children under 5 (there may be exceptions depending on situation).\n\nTypical adoption fees for puppies are $350, juvenile dogs $300, adults dogs are $250, senior dogs are $150. Some pets, smaller dogs for example, may have a higher than normal adoption fee but we will alert you if there is a variance. Dogs rescued from China always have a higher adoption fee. Adoption fees help our group offset PART of the cost of rescuing, rehabilitating, and getting the pet healthy so they can go on to find a loving home with someone willing to give them a second chance at life. This amount includes each animal being current on age appropriate vaccinations including DHPPL, bordetella, influenza, rabies, and boosters when appropriate. De-wormed for any internal parasites (round worms, hook worms, tape worms and whipworms) with Drontal Plus, 4DX tested heart-worm negative (if positive, they are treated), tested negative for tick borne diseases, spayed/neutered, implanted with a micro-chip and have been examined by a veterinarian to certify that they are healthy. Any other known health issues are treated as well prior to adoption (examples: UTI, broken bones, contagious infections, dental cleanings, etc). All animals are also on a regime of flea and heartworm medication every month. Lifetime registration for the micro-chip is included in each adoption fee. In addition, each adopter will go home with a fitted collar, tags, a bag of dog food the pet has been on, copies of all vet history, and an adoption kit filled with valuable information and coupons as well as other various treats or toys as promotions become available. All puppy adoptions include two puppy training books, the Puppy Primer & Way To Go by Patricia McConnell, and all adult adoptions go home with Love Has No Age Limit by Patricia McConnell to help ensure a smooth transition for your new family member.\n\nWe ask that you consider an additional donation on top of this pet's adoption fee. This money will go directly into our Adoption Fund to be used exclusively for rescuing and caring for other pets in need. Many pets we take in have very high vet bills to get them healthy and adoptable for the public - much higher than their adoption fees. We receive no government funding and rely solely on donations from our community and caring adopters to continue our rescue efforts!",

Cats are not going to work. we are working on leash and obedience training but most likely will need further work if adopted as he is young and raring to go. His activity level requires a very nature friendly  hiking or adventure focused family/home.",

He is great with other dogs but does not like to share his toys, bones or food with other pets. So he would need a home with other pets who don't want to take his toys  and if given bones and when fed can do so separately. His foster home said he is learning and getting much better with this. He has absolutelyno aggression with humans. He loves playing, wrestling, and napping with the female pit mix in home.  He is also fine with the cat in his foster.  He loves attention and taking naps.. also enjoys chasing his own tail.  He is house and crate trained now.  \n He does have some off and on skin allergies. We have given him a mixture of Apaquel and Benadryl when needed. His skin looks great now. \n   He is neutered and up to date on his shots.  flea/tick and heartworm prevention.   \n   $150\n\nPlease make sure bully breeds are allowed in your home/area.   There is an application to fill out. \n  Please call and leave a message or text Laura 660-641-5667",

We've always been together and we'll be staying together in our adoptive home. Yep, that's right, we're a package deal. Lucky for you, we are a cute, sweet, friendly bonded pair of little Lap Dogs so if you're the \"more the merrier\" type, consider making us part of your family.  \n\nWe are tiny, about four pounds each -- soaking wet -- which, to be honest, we don't really like to be. Are there chihuahuas out there that like to be soaking wet? Probably not. That's more of a Labrador trait, don't you think? But we digress. \n\nHere's another stat about us. At this point in our lives we've been told we are seniors *eye roll* because we are now around 7-8 years of age. However, please be advised that we are full of life and are very happy, snuggly, adorable boys, so age is really irrelevant we think. Who else doesn't love naps? Show of hands. We certainly like our siestas, and to be held and cuddled and doted on, but we also like exploring the yard, causing a little mischief here or there, and getting fresh air. \n\nWe're a great pair of dogs that are looking for a great home that will love us for the rest of our days. Which aren't numbered, as the label \"senior\" suggests. We've got lots of years left in us, so take a chance and come meet us to see if we choose you! Love, Chico and Diamond",

            "description": "Ram is sweet and adorable and looking for a great forever home!\n\nRam's owner could no longer care for him, so he came to our rescue. He loves to cuddle with a person, and is affectionate. Ram is on two different seizures medications (Keppa and Phenobarbital) which he gets 3x/day and so he needs someone home most of the time. He will need regular bloodwork at the vets. Additionally, he is not housebroken, and we are not sure if this is a neurological issue. He is also mostly deaf. His seizure medicine is expensive and he needs regular bloodwork to ensure his phenobarbital level is at the correct therapeutic dose. \n\nHe recently was groomed, and he will need to be groomed and brushed on a regular basis. He is very sweet, but timid at first, and would do best in a home with no kids or older kids. He just got a dental and had 2 teeth extracted and a small mass removed from his mouth which was sent out to be biopsied. \n\nWe require an adoption application, phone interview, virtual house check, and meet and greet with your entire family. Send us an email at petprofilerescue@gmail.com for a for an adoption application or apply online at: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1S5v9x1oGSYLBSfheZJ_zSvkIHoT3Fe_xnsq5V75IX9w/edit?fbclid=IwAR0rU1zQezgZhhC_01_JpMFhujOq40cu8Xl4xKdiZ0b1L-3Pwm1Et-XI3K4\nIf you have already submitted an application to us, send us an email, expressing your interest in this dog. We are foster based in the Chicago area.\n\nPlease consider SPONSORING Ram to help with his medical needs. You can click on the \"Sponsor\" button or Donations can be made to our Paypal at petprofilerescue@gmail.com or https://paypal.me/petprofilerescue to help with Ram's medical care. \n\nOur rescue dogs' Amazon Wishlist is here: https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1PIG0Y2YAZ2MP\u2026",

He has been spending time with our trainer to help him build confidence in real-life situations (and has been making great improvements). He is inherently a skittish dog, that is very uncertain of new people. He will do best with a confident and assertive owner who understands the necessary and proper leadership vital to his success. He is so loyal and sweet. To continue to do well, he will need someone to hold him accountable and work him through his fears. Sully would do best in a quiet household .

She is currently in the Green Bay, WI area and you must be willing to travel to see her multiple times.***\n\nMika is a 2 year old female German Shepherd looking for a home who can manage her over-protective nature. Mika has been through professional training and is working on approriate behaviors when meeting new people, especially men. Her mistrust and behavior is manageable with a strong leader and consistency. She is not a good candidate for a home with children.\n\nMika gets along well with other dogs and is very playful. She would do well in a home with another younger playful confident dog as she tends to be more friendly around visitors when the other dogs are getting attention. As time goes on she is less anxious around unknown people when there are other dogs being friendly. They have been helping her be a better dog.\n\nShe is a wonderful hiking partner and stays close and has very good recall. She knows all her basic commands and is house trained. She is an extremely intelligent dog who would benefit from being mentally challenged like nose work or something.\n\nIt will most likely take several meetings with Mika before she is comfortable with her new adoptive home. We will require a patient adopter that is committed to continuing her training and helping her succeed in uncertain situations.\n\n----\nFor more information email mitliebegsdr@gmail.com or fill out an application on our website www.mlgsdr.com\n\n*Disclaimer, we're providing what information we know and what has been passed along by previous owners, shelters, etc. If the information you're looking for is not listed, please reach out and request more detail.\n\nAll dogs/puppies have been fully vetted including spay/neuter, micro-chipping, worming, heartworm testing, and preventative treatment, and all required age appropriate vaccinations.

They are not causing her issues right now but need to be monitored and might eventually need Patella surgery. ***** No obvious issues found during vet exam *****\n\nTemperament: Valerie is a super sweet little girl. She is very shy and will take time to come around. She will not do well with little children due to her size and being scared. Valerie loves to wag her tail and show how happy she is but unfortunately she doesn't know how to fully show that she is happy and wants love. Her tail wags 90 to nothin and is the cutest thing ever! She will make a very special little girl for the right person! She gets along fine with the other dogs. --\n\nWhere did she come from: Stray at the Shelter\n\nAdoption: ***** $433.00 Includes Required Tax *****\nWeight: 6.6 lbs.\nApproximate DOB: 12/5/2016\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION: http://www.recycledpoms.org/application --\n\nEmail info@recycledpomeranians.com to request a printable application. --\n\n------Please remember our group is made of only volunteers all of whom have full time jobs, foster fur-kids, and families of their own, so please be patient.--------",

            "description": "IMPORTANT!!!   All adoptions are by appointment only going forward and are spaced 30 minutes apart. PLEASE call the shelter directly during business hours for more information (see number below).  You need to make sure that the animal in which you have an interest is still available and to set up an appointment to meet the specific animal.  Once you arrive at the shelter for your scheduled appointment, please follow the directions that you were given over the telephone. If you are running late for your appointment or will be unable to make your scheduled appointment time, notify staff immediately. This will enable them to schedule that time for another prospective adoptive family. If necessary, they will be able to reschedule your appointment to a more convenient time.  \n\nBLUE is the other half of a pair of dogs surrendered to the shelter on 12/7. The two male dogs are bird dogs/hounds and are estimated to be six years of age. Neither one had been neutered prior to arrival. Because they are new to the shelter, staff does not yet have hands on experience with the two dogs and cannot provide information about their temperament, personalities, likes or dislikes. However, what information they do have they will share with you if you give them a call or when you go there for an adoption appointment. You can meet either one or both dogs in person. However, because neither one has been neutered, that will need to be done before you could take either one home with you. Please read the important information below. \n\nAdoption fees are $80 for dogs.  Cat adoption fees are $50. Cash or check only. \nNOTE: All shelter fees are under review and may be changed or modified at any time without advance notice.\n\nThe shelter routinely vaccinates all healthy appearing animals upon their arrival at the shelter and deworms them.  Any animals not already spayed/neutered must have the procedure done through the veterinary clinic that contracts with the county before that animal can be released from the clinic to the new family. By state law, animals old enough to be given a rabies vaccine, must have that vaccine done, as well.  The vaccine is given by the veterinary clinic staff at a separate cost to the adoptive family. \n\nHold periods for every incoming animal vary for several reasons including, but not limited to, whether the animal came in from the Cumberland County area, or from the City of Crossville, which contracts with the county for its animal shelter services.  Check with the staff to verify the availability date of every animal for which you have an interest.\n\nFor more information on this pet, call the shelter at (931)484-8525. The shelter is open Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday from 10am to 2pm. Closed Wednesday and Sunday and county observed holidays.",

Unfortunately, my previous adoption did not work out as I am a rowdy player and the current dog in the home was much more timid.  I have fun playing with the coonhound in my foster home and I am looking for a spot where people understand I am still very much a young pup.  I like to play and be busy, and without constructive activity, I can find naughty things to do, like chew on non-dog toys.  On the positive, I am fully house trained and even use a bell to indicate I want out.  (How smart is that?!?) Mom says I am so loving, and I especially love romping around outdoors with foster dad.  Because I am so young and active, mom does not want me to go to a home where I am alone all day, so I need a family that is gone for shorter periods.  I go in my crate easily but don't want to be there all day.  I also need a fenced yard.  I am a good boy, and will really shine in the right environment.  \n\nIf interested in me, please fill out the adoption application under the \"Adoption\" heading on our website www.bassetbuddiesrescue.org and a volunteer will reach out to you.",

            "description": "IMPORTANT!!!   All adoptions are by appointment only going forward and are spaced 30 minutes apart. PLEASE call the shelter directly during business hours for more information (see number below).  You need to make sure that the animal in which you have an interest is still available and to set up an appointment to meet the specific animal.  Once you arrive at the shelter for your scheduled appointment, please follow the directions that you were given over the telephone. If you are running late for your appointment or will be unable to make your scheduled appointment time, notify staff immediately. This will enable them to schedule that time for another prospective adoptive family. If necessary, they will be able to reschedule your appointment to a more convenient time.  \n\nBO is a six-year-old male Bird Dog/Hound. He has not yet been neutered and he was surrendered to the shelter along with another birddog named Blue. Since they just arrived, staff does not yet have any hands-on experience with the two dogs to be able to provide you with immediate information about their temperament, personality, likes and dislikes. Whatever information they do have from the previous owner, they will be happy to share with you either over the telephone or in person when you go there for your adoption appointment to meet one or both of the dogs in person. Because BO has not yet been neutered, that still needs to be done before he can go home with you. So, please read the important information below.\n\nAdoption fees are $80 for dogs.  Cat adoption fees are $50. Cash or check only. \nNOTE: All shelter fees are under review and may be changed or modified at any time without advance notice.\n\nThe shelter routinely vaccinates all healthy appearing animals upon their arrival at the shelter and deworms them.  Any animals not already spayed/neutered must have the procedure done through the veterinary clinic that contracts with the county before that animal can be released from the clinic to the new family. By state law, animals old enough to be given a rabies vaccine, must have that vaccine done, as well.  The vaccine is given by the veterinary clinic staff at a separate cost to the adoptive family. \n\nHold periods for every incoming animal vary for several reasons including, but not limited to, whether the animal came in from the Cumberland County area, or from the City of Crossville, which contracts with the county for its animal shelter services.  Check with the staff to verify the availability date of every animal for which you have an interest.\n\nFor more information on this pet, call the shelter at (931)484-8525. The shelter is open Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday from 10am to 2pm. Closed Wednesday and Sunday and county observed holidays.",
