She can be very shy with strangers and new things but with time warms up into a very affectionate girl. She typically gets along with other dogs but can get a bit overwhelmed, we would recommend bring your dog in to meet her before adoption. She is still a puppy and will need adopters who can keep up with her training and help socialize her to new things. If you are interested in this gorgeous pup contact us today!",

            "description": "Meet Ebony! Ebony had a pretty rough start to life. She was found living in an old SUV in the dead of winter. She was terrified, cold and hungry. She has not had any socialization so everything is new and scary. Ebony has come a long way since she arrived at the shelter, but she is still pretty skittish, and frightened of things. Despite his rough start to life, she is a happy girl! She is friendly, and loves to play. It took awhile for her to even figure out how to play with a toy. Ebony will require a family who can be patient with her and give her the time and space she needs until she feels comfortable. She does not do well with other female dogs, and we aren't sure about male dogs, so we recommend home without any other dogs. She absolutely does NOT like cats. That we know for certain. So she needs to be in a home without cats. We recommend children over 13, as she gets startled easily.\n\nYou can visit Ebony at the Euclid Animal Shelter, 25100 Lakeland Blvd., Euclid, OH. He has received his initial set of vaccinations except rabies and will be neutered before leaving the shelter. His adoption fee is $80. All of our dog kennels have indoor/outdoor runs so we cannot say with certainty if any of our dogs are housetrained.\n\nWe do not test our animals with other cats or dogs. You are welcome to bring your dog to the shelter for a \u201cMeet and Greet\u201d in one of our outdoor play yards, one of our experienced volunteers will help you.\n\n*** IMPORTANT UPDATE PER OUR ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICER ***\n\n\u201cThe Shelter will be changing some policies regarding adoptions and reclaims. Your Health as well as ours here at the Shelter is very important. We will be implementing all of the Health Department\u2019s recommendations.\nReclaims and adoptions will be by appointment only.\nYou are asked to call the Shelter if you see a dog or cat on line you are interested in or your animal has been impounded.\n216-289-2057\nThank You\nAnn Mills\nAnimal Control\u201d",

Here is what would work best for me in my new home:\n\n-Personality: Active, boisterous, a little timid at first\n-Can Live with Kids: Mabel is still very much a puppy and doesn't quite realize her size-- she will very easily knock down small children. At this time, we are recommending no kids under 10 years of age, pending an introduction here at the shelter.\n-Can Live with Cats: NO- Mabel's previous owner said \"SHE HATES CATS\" and also \"CHASES ANYTHING THAT MOVES\".\n-Can Live with Dogs: Yes! Another active, rowdy dog of similar size would be great for her!\n-Can do Apartment Living: NO- this high energy dog needs a large place to call her own. Ideally she would have access to a securely fenced yard.\n-Potty Trained: Appears to be!\n-Bite History: No\n-Positive Reward Based Obedience Classes Required: Yes-- depending on adopter experience, between 1-3 private lessons.\n-Energy Level: Very high!\n-Needs Medical Procedure Before Going Home: Yes, a spay\n-Additional Information: Mabel is a friendly young dog who was surrendered to the shelter when her owners realized that dogs are a lot of work! Mabel is a rambunctious pup who wasn't given many tools for success in her previous home, but she is super smart, attentive, and eager to learn!

I am great with other animals as you can see! I have foster sibling puppies that are big and little! I am as cute and sweet as it gets! I am around 2-3 years old and I am about 12 pounds. I am completely house and crate trained. I\u2019m still learning to love men but I\u2019m doing so much better. \n\nThe adoption donation fee is $350 which is tax-deductible and goes towards the care of homeless pets with Pals for Paws. \n\nTo expedite the adoption process you can fill out an application online at www.palsforpawsinc.com/adopt. Please note the adoption application doesn\u2019t bind you to anything. Pals for Paws reserves the right to refuse any adoption application for any reason and at any point in the adoption process. \n\nTo view our other wonderful Homeless Pets visit www.palsforpawsinc.com/pet-list ALSO be sure to LIKE Pals for Paws on Facebook at www.facebook.com/palsforpaws.inc \n\nAll Pals for Paws Rescue animals are fully vetted:\n*Spayed/Neutered\n*Groomed\n*Shots updated plus Leptospirosis \n*Micro-chipped\n*Dewormed \n*On Heart-worm prevention\n*On Flea and Tick Prevention\n* Dentals are done if needed \n\nYou only need to see your vet for a \u201cmeet n greet\u201d of your new family member and to turn in their medical records.\n\nPals for Paws is a 501(c)3 animal rescue. Every penny donated and every penny received through adoption fees goes right back into the organization. There are times when the volunteers have to dip into their pockets to help the animals. We do not euthanize because a pet is sick, heart-worm positive, or has a broken leg; we fix it all, big and small. We strive to go above and beyond when caring for and socializing our animals. We understand the importance of getting to know each and every animal available for adoption in an effort to place them in the most perfect home possible. \nIf you are looking for a particular type of dog or have special needs, We can help!

Here is what would work best for me in my new home:\n\n-Personality: Intelligent, active and very alert!\n-Can Live with Kids: 16 and older due to sensitivity of environment and touch.\n-Can Live with Cats: Unknown history, may be prey driven. Confident cats only. \n-Can Live with Dogs: Yes, a dog of similar play style (mellow, not rough and rowdy) who is tolerant to rude behavior. \n-Can do Apartment Living: No. Ideally Dixie would have a fenced in yard with plenty of space to exercise and explore daily. \n-Potty Trained: Appears to be! \n-Bite History: None \n-Positive Reward Based Obedience Classes Required: Yes, 1 private lesson to help bond with owner. \n-Energy Level: HIGH\n-Needs Medical Procedure Before Going Home: Nope \n-Additional Information: Dixie has not taken well to the shelter life. With her increased stress levels it makes it difficult to see her true personality. With regular exercise and lots of mental stimulation, her anxiety levels should even out a bit more. Her Ideal home would understand and have experience with dogs who have high levels of anxiety or experience with separation anxiety. Dixie would do really well if she was given a \"job\" or if she was trained for agility. Her future home has to be committed to her mental health and ensure Dixie thrives once out of the shelter. Without proper care Dixie will become increasingly sensitive and for this reason she can not live in a home with young children.",

They wanted him to find a loving home that could properly care for him through his puppyhood and into his adulthood and the rest of his life.  He is very sweet- your typical shepherd.  Vocal, playful and active.  He's very smart, and shadows his person's every move.  He's wonderful around dogs, cats, chickens, everything he's met here at the rescue, and with good, continued socialization he will make a remarkable dog for someone or some family willing to take on a large breed puppy.\nMarlowe is up to date on shots, neutered and microchipped.  Adoption fee $400.\n\nCopy and paste this link in your browser to fill out the adoption application:\nhttps://forms.gle/tU3rJyBhqxrd2vqw8\n\nThe rescue suggests obedience training for all puppies and dogs",

He would be great in a home with the bulldog experience who knows how to manage a \"high maintenance\" breed such as he.  He would be best in a home without cats, as he doesn't have a super prey drive, but he gets a little too interested in them when they cross paths.\nHe's also a bigger guy, around 30lbs now with a few pounds to gain (maybe 5-7 more would be ideal), but a very athletic and sweet guy.  He'd be a great companion for good solid walks or jogging, and we would like to see him in a cooler climate than the central valley, with his snub nose and all. \nHugo uses a dog door and seems to be housebroken in that regard.  He is also now up to date on shots, neutered and microchipped.  Adoption fee $850.\n\n\nCopy and paste this link in your browser to fill out the adoption application:\nhttps://forms.gle/tU3rJyBhqxrd2vqw8\n\nThe rescue suggests obedience training for all puppies and dogs",

            "description": "Sassafras is a feist who is about 2 yrs old and weighs 26 pounds.  She was owner surrendered to animal control because she wouldn't hunt.  She will tree the squirrel but runs when the gun is fired.  on the other hand she is happy to be a pet.  She's friendly, ready to cuddle and loves attention.  She is a little skittish which leads me to believe her previous owner didn't always treat her gently but she wants to please.\nThe next step is to fill out an online application. Once we have reviewed your application we will get back to you as soon as possible. We have the right to decline an application if it is not a good fit for that particular animal. \n\nNot yet ready to adopt?  You can sponsor a pet now to help pay for medical expenses, special diets, toys and treats, emergency medical care, etc., to provide for him or her during foster care.  Our adoption fee rarely covers our expenses, so any size donation is appreciated!   You can donate by check or Paypal by visiting our website at www.cofas.org \n\n\n********************************************\nAll of our dogs are fostered in our homes so we know their temperaments.  They are spayed or neutered, up to date on shots, de-wormed, heartworm tested (and treated if necessary), and on flea and heartworm prevention. Our adoption fee begins at $195.00 for all of our dogs and puppies. Our goal is to match our animals to the best home possible.  Please email info@cofas.org for more information.  You can also fill out an application at www.cofas.org",

            "description": "*** MEDICAL HOLD*** \n***SPECIAL NEEDS***  \n***FOSTERED IN TALLAHASSEE***\n***FENCED IN YARD REQUIRED***\n\nTy is 2 yo deaf and vision impaired dane that is the product of unethical double merle breeding. He is the definition of gentle giant, he\u2019s an absolute snuggle bunny, a constant shadow. He always has to be touching you, or lying on you. And he\u2019s about 145 lbs.. so good luck moving from your spot on the couch if he\u2019s on your legs.\n\nTy came to us from another rescue that was closing its doors and moving away. The reason he was surrendered to that rescue was because his owners couldn\u2019t afford his vetting care and he was dealing with a very seriously infected and deep lick granuloma that covers almost his entire back ankle and leg. Lick granulomas are very hard to heal, they have to heal from the inside out and breathe (shouldn\u2019t be bandaged up) and the dog\u2019s licking just makes them get exponentially worse. It looks like a burn injury. Ty\u2019s granuloma was covering almost his entire back leg. So now he\u2019s on a very strict regimen of twice daily antibiotics, regular cleanings, and he has to be coned or muzzled to prevent him from constantly licking it when he\u2019s not being directly observed.\n\nThis injury will take many months to fully heal. Whoever adopts Ty will need to understand that this will be a long recovery and he\u2019s already become OCD about licking his legs when he\u2019s bored, so he cannot be left alone without muzzle and cone on.\n\nTy is living with two other Great Danes, both males, one is 2 1/2 years old and the other one is nine years old, and he\u2019s great with both of them. He also frequently lives with a female pug who comes over to play. He has never ever been aggressive with anything or anyone.

It was freezing that night and the person heard them crying and took them in until we were able to pick them up.  The girls are very sweet, and despite their rough start, very social.  Kristy is the more subdued shy one of the two, but sweet as pie.  The girls love all dogs and cats and critters they have met here at the rescue.  They will make wonderful family pets for just about any home willing to take on the work of a large breed pup.  \nKristy is up to date on shots, knows how to use a dog door, will be spayed prior to adoption and microchipped.  Adoption fee $375.\n\nCopy and paste this link in your browser to fill out the adoption application:\nhttps://forms.gle/tU3rJyBhqxrd2vqw8\n\nThe rescue suggests obedience training for all puppies and dogs",

It was freezing that night and the person heard them crying and took them in until we were able to pick them up.  The girls are very sweet, and despite their rough start, very social.  Katie is definitely more brave and outgoing and they love all dogs and cats and critters they have met here at the rescue.  They will make wonderful family pets for just about any home willing to take on the work of a large breed pup.  \nKatie is up to date on shots, knows how to use a dog door, will be spayed prior to adoption and microchipped.

            "description": "Kiara / Female / 2 Years / 43 lbs / Street Mix / North York\n\nMeet Kiara! Kiara has had a tough time finding the perfect home - but we know its out there! Her fosters describe her as a sweet and cuddly dog who loves giving kisses. She loves to play fetch and could go for hours. When she is indoors she likes squeaky toys, puzzle toys and stuffed kongs. Kiara is an active girl who would do best with a family who shares her loves of structured adventure. She is loving, loyal, high energy, playful and very smart. Kiara is looking for a special family who is committed to helping her reach her full potential!\n\nWhen her foster parents come home, she is the happiest dog you\u2019ll ever see. It took her a day or two to warm up to them but since then has been loving and friendly. Kiara is unsure of new people and can be reactive if her space isn\u2019t respected. When people are calm and avoid eye contact or trying to pet her, generally she responds with a more balanced energy. Regardless her humans will need to advocate for her space and give new people firm instructions when entering her space. Adopters should have realistic expectations when meeting her, as it will take time to earn her trust.\n\nWhen left alone Kiara is crated and needs someone to sit with her for her to settle. After a few minutes she will lie down for a nap, as long as she\u2019s received enough exercise. Kiara is currently getting 2, 30 minute walks per day plus lots of time to play in the back yard. With adequate opportunities to use the washroom, Kiara is fully potty trained.\n\nKiara\u2019s leash walking is a work in progress, as she is quite fearful of things outdoors. She is especially reactive to people in coats, other dogs, and sometimes cars/bicycles. She will bark or lunge to express her discomfort and demand her space. Her fosters are focused on clicker training and keeping Kiara on a familiar and predictable route for walks. Potential adopters should have experience with reactive dogs and a solid understanding of the work ahead with Kiara. They should also be willing to hire a professional trainer as needed.\n\nKiara is smart and picks up commands fairly quickly. Inside the home she has good focus, and knows sit and come. She needs a structured home environment so access to furniture and all valued items should be earned through training. Kiara currently sleeps in her crate and ideally this structure would continue in her forever home. She can sometimes confuse items around the home with her toys and chew them. She will need supervision at all times and adopters comfortable with consistent redirection.\n\nKiara\u2019s ideal home would be a detached home, outside of the city. She will need a fully fenced backyard as its where she is most comfortable playing and enjoying outdoors. With her current level of reactivity she would not thrive in a city environment and is only looking for homes in quiet country or the suburbs. Kiara is dog selective and can be bossy and dominant in play. She has also shown some resource guarding with other dogs, so she would prefer to be the only pet in the home at this time. Kiara needs a a predictable and low activity household where she can really start to shine. Kiara is looking for adult-only homes.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adopting Kiara please apply at https://www.fetchandreleash.ca/adoption-info#adoption-form\n\nKiara\u2019s adoption fee is $800.

She\u2019s affectionate with humans, a good cuddles, wants constant attention, and a bundle of nerves and energy. You see, Calamity fits her name... She is a wild child, always on the go.. and she can be very dominant, loud and bossy at play with other dogs. She needs slow introductions. And if she feels intimidated or threatened she gets more outwardly protective/dominant. It\u2019s a defense mechanism with her it seems. \n\nWe were told that Calamity is 2.5, but she honestly acts way younger than that. A total puppy. Calamity seems younger than her age  and she can act high strung at times around other dogs, which can be a lot to handle for other dogs. She plays like a puppy as far as energy level goes but is waaaay too dominant/ aggressive with her initiation and rough housing. But she's not actually trying to bite or hurt the other dog. She really just wants to play but doesn't know how to properly. She would do best in a home with very submissive playmate who will allow her to be rough and tumble and help wear her out. She WILL NOT do well in a house with a senior or any dog who doesn\u2019t tolerate hyperactive well.. calamity is not the one for you. \n\nCalamity came from a backyard breeding bust. She came in with three other Danes when we pulled them from north Florida shelter in January. None had ever lived inside a home, so she\u2019s learning potty training for the first time at 2. She isn't great about telling her foster parents she needs to go out but as long as they make sure she goes out regularly then she goes outside. Only two accidents so far.\n\nShe\u2019s actually been very trustworthy and not gotten into anything when her foster parents are gone for work, for hours on end. \n\nCalamity will not be a good fit for a family with cats, young kids, farm animals or other dominant dogs. She\u2019s just too much. She will absolutely require a fenced in yard.\n\nCalamity is now fully vetted, vaccinated, spayed and chipped. Her adoption fee is $400. \n\nTo read over our adoption requirements and apply to adopt Lacy please go to www.nwflgdr.com/adopt.\n\nATTENTION: NWFLGDR DOES NOT TRANSPORT. If you are applying from out of area or out of state, understand that if your application gets approved, you will be expected to pick up the dane in the location that he/she is being fostered. In addition, if the adoption does not work out, it is your responsibility to bring the dane safely back to us.",

He is very well behaved in the house and is on the quiet side. He is very protective of his home and people so he isn't the type of dog that you could have visitors over or trust that someone could easily walk into the home. He would have to carefully be introduced to all new people outside and be given time to warm up. \n\nIf you think you might be a good fit for Dexter, you can email us at adopt@scituateanimalshelter.org",

Great! We have an adoption process that tries to ensure that our LLR animals have found their forever home. Adopting from LLR isn\u2019t the fastest process. We do not have a paid staff and rely on volunteers-for everything. From animal care, and veterinary appointments to checking emails, answering phone calls and scheduling all meet n greets! Please be patient with us, animals come first around here. We are not in a rush to place any of the animals in LLR. All of our animals live in foster homes comfortably which means that we can take our time to find the best possible home for each animal in our care. \n\nTo learn more about the Little Lotus adoption process, please go to:\nhttps://littlelotusrescueandsanctuary.org/adoption-process/\n\nFor an application to meet this pet, please go to:https://littlelotusrescueandsanctuary.org/adoption-application/\n\nBeing fostered in Sierra Vista, AZ.

That is the first thing the vet said after her first visit. She is not interested in toys but she loves to follow her people around the house and sleeps on her bed wherever they are. She loves ear rubs and neck scratches. She likes to go on neighborhood walks and prances around like a princess. She loves snacks, especially turkey and bacon. She is not a big couch cuddler but does love hugs and enjoys being held like a baby. She has lots of puppy dreams and even snores when she is in a deep sleep sometimes. It's so adorable! She has about 10-20% of her vision but she navigates around her environment quite well. We think she is partially deaf as well. She is housebroken, but does have occasional accidents. She is currently being treated for an eye infection and will follow up with the vet in one week to make sure it is cleared up. She's very tolerant of the eye drops and medications and getting brushed too. She is not much of a barker. She did well with the other dogs at the dog park but was not very interested in them. She is great around kids. Unknown how she is with cats but anticipate she would do well with them also. She is super laid back and just loves to be around people. We have fallen in love with her in a short amount of time. We know you will too!\nBDRA has voted against the use of electrical fencing effective immediately.",

He\u2019s 5 years old and has a blissful calm temperament. But can be playful too, with the right playmate.  He\u2019s never met a human he didn\u2019t love! \n\nHe\u2019s currently in a foster home with a 2 year old female Great Dane & they get along great. Blu has also befriended 2 other female dogs that are family friends of his foster parents. A pitbull and a lab/heeler mix.  \n\nThe shelter Blue was rescued from mentioned he may not be good with male dogs and while we haven\u2019t seen this completely in action; so far it does seem true since he throws a fit at the fence when his foster\u2019s neighbor\u2019s male Labrador is out in the yard at the same time as he is. \n\nBlue does know how to open doors for himself and isn\u2019t shy about letting himself out for a tour of the front yard and to take a nice pee on the mailbox; so it\u2019s important to ensure all doors and gates are secured. He knows how to sit and is working on other basic obedience commands too. \n\nBlue takes corrections quickly & proactively and is now crate trained and completely potty trained by doggy door; however when he is introduced to a new environment he may \u201cmark\u201d the new space with a few pee spots. This only happened a few times when initially arriving to his foster home. He\u2019s also great on leash & loves walks. \n\nBlue has not been around any children while with his foster family but they believe he would be great with them, as long as they are big enough to not get smooshed!\n\nBlue's adoption fee is $350. To read over our adoption requirements and apply to adopt Blue please go to www.nwflgdr.com/adopt.\n\nATTENTION: NWFLGDR DOES NOT TRANSPORT. If you are applying from out of area or out of state, understand that if your application gets approved, you will be expected to pick up the dane in the location that he/she is being fostered. In addition, if the adoption does not work out, it is your responsibility to bring the dane safely back to us.",

He loves human attention but isn\u2019t so sure around other dogs, he is very submissive around other dogs.\n\nChance is currently out of state, we are coordinating his rescue to Colorado, he is scheduled to arrive before the end of the month. He got picked up by animal control in Clovis, New Mexico. When he was picked up, he was already neutered so he obviously had a home before but no owner came for him at the shelter. We would like to put Chance straight into a trial adoption situation when he arrives. The process for that is the same and requires an adoption application.\n\nChance arrives fully vaccinated, neutered and microchipped, ready for his new Colorado home and lifestyle. He is around 1 year old and weighs 50lbs.\n\nChance knows just how miraculous a turn his life has taken when he was picked out by Havok\u2019s Wolfpack and he is determined to live his new life to the fullest in the most adventurous way, hopefully, with you.\n\nHis adoption fee is $400\n\nIf you are interested in Chance, please submit an adoption application here:\nwww.havokswolfpack.com/adopt",

She is sometimes shy when meeting new people but once she's comfy, she loves her people. She is nervous when meeting new dogs until she's comfy with them too. But she just tolerates other dogs in her space and is not going to be your dogs new friend and playmate, she wants human attention not dog attention. We needed to be sure as she was a very protective Mama dog with her babies (all adopted now). It is her turn to be someone's baby instead of a baby maker. She doesn't care for the outside world much so her new family needs to be able to work with her on that or be prepared to have a potty pad girl. There were a lot of dogs in the home she came from so none learned much of anything and she's recently off Mama duty with us so we're just now able to work with her and really get to know Addy as a girl and not a mama dog.\nShe does NOT walk on leash so you MUST have a securely fenced yard that she cannot escape from and be willing to be outside with her so raptors don't snatch her up.\nIf you think Miss Addy might be the new companion for you, please submit our adoption application to get the process started.\n\nPlease visit our website directly to complete an online application.",

He required very slow introductions to both his new humans and fellow pack companions. \u00a0Once he settled in, he quickly became your typical Velcro Dane and glued himself to his foster mom\u2019s side. He seems more guarded with human males but within a few days, opens to them as well. He\u2019s just learned that a couch is the best place to sleep and is more than happy to climb up into your lap and take a nap. \n\u00a0\nBo is basically a toddler who will need a watchful eye as he is still learning to be an indoor dog. He is a chewer and will need lots of toys to keep him occupied at all times. He is also a fan of socks and bras which his foster mom does not find as funny.\u00a0He will also need a crate in his new home, or he will be destructive when left alone. He is fantastic at crating and does not fight going in or whine/bark when crated. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nSince he is learning to be an indoor dog, this also means he is working on going potty outside. He is picking up from his fellow pack quickly and starting to go to the door when he needs to go out. He has accidents here and there but will be a pro in no time. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nBo is currently living with two other NWFLGDR alumni and a lab mix who he loves to play with. He doesn\u2019t know his size and likes to body slam the lab mix who is about 50lbs so they have to have monitored playtime. He is an extremely rough player with all the dogs and would probably do better without a small dog to stomp on in his new home. There are two cats in the home as well however they stay separated from the dogs so we aren\u2019t sure how he would react to them.\n\u00a0\nNow that Bo has made himself at home, we know that he is very loving, clumsy and playful. He is a sweet boy who just needs love, toys, a blanket to drag around and a good cartoon to watch every once in awhile. Bo is your typical Dane who deserves the best furever home possible.\n\nBocephus is neutered, vaccinated and chipped. His adoption fee is $400. \n\nTo read over our adoption requirements and apply to adopt Bo please go to www.nwflgdr.com/adopt.\n\nATTENTION: NWFLGDR DOES NOT TRANSPORT. If you are applying from out of area or out of state, understand that if your application gets approved, you will be expected to pick up the dane in the location that he/she is being fostered. In addition, if the adoption does not work out, it is your responsibility to bring the dane safely back to us.",

            "description": "Foster location:  Boise ID \nBreed:  Lab\nAge:  12 years \nSize:  60 lbs\nAdoption Fee:  $50.00\nSpayed, Vaccinated, Microchipped\n\nAdoption Application:  http://fuzzypawzrescue.com/adopt/adoption-application-2/\n\nMischa came to Fuzzy Pawz after finding herself in a local shelter.  This poor thing had a bunch of nasty growths all over her body including a deep one on her head that bled constantly!  She also had giardia and a wicked ear infection.  We had the lumps removed and got the other issues cleared up; it took months but she is now ready to find a forever home.\nShe is the sweetest girl who is all about enjoying the retirement phase of her life. Her foster family has affectionately named her \u201cThe Lounge Princess\u201d, as that is her favorite daily activity. Her other favorite activity is eating, which she does with gusto. Even though she can\u2019t read a clock, she always knows when it\u2019s mealtime, and will make sure you do too! Her foster family has only ever heard her bark a handful of times in the several months they have had her, and every time it was just a single \u201cwoof\u201d when they weren\u2019t getting her meal quickly enough!\nWhile Mischa likes to take it easy and relax most of the day, she does still enjoy getting outside for short, slow walks around the block where she can get some good sniffs. Being a senior dog, Mischa has a few ongoing treatments her new owners will need to commit to. She has some arthritis, which is why she doesn\u2019t move very fast, is deaf in both ears (due to untreated ear infections), and since she came to Fuzzy Pawz she has been diagnosed with Cushing\u2019s Disease. This condition makes her have increased appetite and thirst, heat intolerance, and a weakened immune system. She is on daily medication which she will need to continue for the rest of her life.  As a side-effect of Cushing\u2019s Disease, she also has multiple benign sebaceous cysts on her skin. She has had several of the larger ones removed while with Fuzzy Pawz, but these will also be something she will deal with the rest of her life.\nDespite some health conditions, she is very easy to take care of and will be your most loyal companion. She is house-trained, crate-trained, has learned hand signals for \u201ccome\u201d, \u201csit\u201d, and \u201cstay\u201d, and does great on a leash. She gets along well with other dogs. It is unknown how she is with children and cats. Although she has shown no aggression with either when she has encountered them on walks; that being said we would prefer a quiet/calm household with no kids under 15.\nWe will be honest it is not likely that Mischa will live more than 6-12 months; but she is 100% worth living her best life with people who love her!\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a loving, easy-going couch potato to add to your family, Mischa is you.\n\n\n",

This former mama is easily adjusting to being an inside dane.  She is so very sweet and delicate as the word \u201clacy\u201d may describe. She loves snuggles and wants to be as close as possible to her human.  \nLacy came to us with a skin and eye infection we are treating and seems to be recovering well.\n\nLacy currently lives with single Foster mom with 3 cats, a lab/pit mix and old lady lab.  This girl is so sweet and gentle. She loves to snuggle.\n\nFoster mom thinks she may have some basic obedience for sit and down, but \u201coff\u201d just means switch to the other couch.  \n\nShe is good in the crate and will go to the crate when there is lots of work/activity in the house, but don\u2019t be fooled she wants to be with her human. Lacy hasn\u2019t display chewing behaviors and we haven\u2019t found her high value toy just yet.  She prefers to snuggle on the bed and with her human.\n\nLacy hasn\u2019t been exposed to children with foster Mom, but this girl is very calm so we feel she will be just fine.\nCats: She plays with foster mom\u2019s indoor/outdoor cat who seems to understand chase play. So chase cats are good and she is very indifferent to the other two cats.\n\nLacey is gentle and kind and the definition of good. She is now spayed and vaccinated and chipped. She is being treated for a skin infection and I\u2019ll and ear infection and will need to continue her antibiotic regimen.\n\nLacy\u2019s adoption fee is $400. To read over our adoption requirements and apply to adopt Lacy please go to www.nwflgdr.com/adopt.\n\nATTENTION: NWFLGDR DOES NOT TRANSPORT. If you are applying from out of area or out of state, understand that if your application gets approved, you will be expected to pick up the dane in the location that he/she is being fostered. In addition, if the adoption does not work out, it is your responsibility to bring the dane safely back to us.",

My previous owners said I am potty trained and I never bark. So far the staff keeps saying I am the cutest girl ever and I really like hearing that. I won't do well with young children as they are a little scary to me. I am still pending my behavior testing and I am currently getting up to date on vaccines so I can be a very healthy girl when I go to my new home. If you can open your home and heart to me, please give the shelter a call!",

            "description": "Greta, a year old, is a big, beautiful, and loving girl.  She has a serious demeanor and is mellow by nature.  She likes long naps and exploring large outdoor spaces.  She likes to play with her canine companion and take long walks with her humans.  She is cautious meeting new people and dogs, but warms up well.  She is good on the leash, house trained (uses a pet door), and crate trained (sleeps here at night).  Greta likes car rides, but prefers to be front and center with a view out the windshield.  This fits her personality as she is a confident girl who likes to be in charge.  Greta knows basic commands like sit and stay, but is working on reactive resource guarding behavior.  She will need ongoing work in this area with an experienced owner who can provide the love, structure, and training she needs.\n\nGreta was born to working pyrenees on a ranch in Wyoming and came to Lucky's Place with her litter mates as a young pup. She has spent her first year living with a family who love her very much, but sadly are unable to keep her.  Greta needs a home with a big yard to explore and play and would do well with a canine  companion close to her own age and size.  Although Greta is used to being around children and is quite fond of them, she would do best in a home without children as she needs the consistent guidance of a confident leader who is familiar with pyrenees behavior traits and committed to her ongoing training and socialization.  Greta has been gently curious about other small pets, but has not lived with cats.  She is not the lap dog type, but more of a sit at attention by your side kind of girl.  Greta is a perfect hiking partner and will be a faithful steady companion for the right owner.",

She is wonderful with people but not a fan of other animals in the home. She loves to be with her people and is very well behaved. She has been thoroughly checked over by our vet and, has been spayed and vaccinated. She is ready to find the perfect home. We would recommend no small children due to her size. She does have some crooked teeth which causes her tongue to hang out at times. Her rear dewclaws were removed because there were indications that she had been chewing on them. She has had only a few accidents in the foster home when she first arrived but has been going outside to do zoomies and potty.\n\nA physically fenced yard would be preferred but, a home with a dedicated leash walker and, someone who could manage a dog of her size and, understand, that she cannot be around other dogs will be considered as well.\n\nInterested adopters living within a 4 hours driving distance of Toledo, Ohio may apply with us. Our adoption fee is $350 and covers her spay, vaccinations, fecal, microchip and, 4DX panel which test for heartworm and tick-borne illnesses. Her hips and legs were evaluated with no concerns found. She was also examined for a dental and, a dental was not recommended at this time. \n\nIncomplete applications will not be reviewed. If you have used veterinary services in the past please list them on the application. We do check references and perform a home visit.\n\nOur application: https://www.deaconshope.org/adoption-application.html",

Enzo is a typical male chihuahua, he knows how to use a pee pad and will go outside in nice weather but he will mark if there are other male dogs in the home. For this reason he would do best in a home with just him and Sophie. He is the ultimate lapdog, and if your lap is occupied he will take a perch on your shoulder. Enzo prefers a quiet home with not a lot of visitors, he also does not prefer small children. Do you have a quiet home for Enzo and Sophie to live out their days?\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete our Pre-application: https://form.jotform.us/asr628/ShortAdoptionInquiry\n\n----------------------PLEASE READ-------------------------------\nOur dogs are dogs are fostered in Texas but available for adoption in the Pacific Northwest...With stops in - Lacey, WA  and Portland, OR.\nThese dogs are transported to a predetermined location agreed upon by the rescue.\n\nOur out of state adoption fee is $500.

Well, we have your Aretha right here at SG and you and she will likely be singing and humming from here on out, together forever. Aretha is just about the sweetest, prettiest hound around, although she is somewhat shy and does not seem to know just how spectacular she really is. Aretha is about 2 or so years old and is underweight at about 50 lbs. Girlfriend has long legs and gorgeous long hound ears, a beautiful tri colored coat and loves the outdoors, roaming and sniffing with her hound nose. Aretha has day by day been getting a little more confident and will continue to bloom in a home, ideally with other dogs, as she finds companionship in dogs and will do well to have one who leads the way and helps her to build her confidence. Aretha would love a fenced in yard and would likely do well with slightly older children as she is still shy and not used to lots of loud noises and games of hide and go seek. Aretha would love to earn your respect and win your heart in 2021!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

Please complete a pre-adoption application at https://redemptionroadrescue.rescuegroups.org/forms/form?formid=4003.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: We expect a high volume of interest in this puppy, so please be patient with us as we review all applications. As a foster-based rescue, we don't have a facility for visits with multiple animals. Meet & greets with dogs are arranged one the pre-adoption application has been received, processed, reviewed, AND approved.\n\nFor Puppies adoption fee is $450.00 for the age appropriate vetting they have had so far. (2 DHPP vaccines, deworming on a schedule, and will come with microchip) Puppies still need: 1-2 more DHPP vaccines and a rabies on an age appropriate schedule, and eventual spay or neuter (recommended when closer to 5 1/2- 6 months old) If you want the puppy altered with our vet, the adoption fee is $650.00 (adopter is responsible for the in between vaccines). If you want to alter (spay or neuter) your puppy at your vet, the adoption fee is $450.00, and we ask you to sign a spay/neuter contract and will need to show proof of S/N at later date.\n\nredemptionroad.mn@gmail.com\n\nhttp://redemptionroadrescue.rescuegroups.org\n\nAll animals fully vetted appropriate for age:\nSpayed or Neutered\nRabies vaccine\nDHPP vaccine\n4DX test (@12 months or older)\nMicrochipped\nDewormed\nFlea/tick prevention",

He is ready for his forever home.\n\nYou can complete an adoption application on our website at:  \n     www.onceuponatailrescue.com\nor\n     Scroll down on this page & click \"More About Us\", & then click \"Adoption            Application\" underneath our bright Pink logo. \n\nIf you want to meet a pup in person, Once Upon a Tail Rescue does adoption events at PetSmart in Covington, LA on most Saturdays with many of our adoptable dogs there. \n\nDon't forget to complete your application ahead of time, so you don't miss out on the pup you've connected with.  If pre-approved, you have first priority & can usually take home your new best friend the same day!  \n\n*Please note that there is no obligation to adopt by completing an application.*\n\n**All dogs are required to have complete vet services, including shots, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip, which are included in the Adoption Fee. Some dogs may still require completion of these services due to current age, size, breed and/or health. All vet services must be done at the vet clinic used by Once Upon a Tail Rescue.",

This little girl will follow you everywhere if you let her. She is an amazing companion.  She does get a little anxious when left home alone; she does better if she has a doggie companion but still misses her humans if they leave her.  The perfect home for her would be someone who is home more often than not; it needs to be pretty quiet without a lot of goings-on and she needs a consistent schedule.\n\nRoxy knows basic commands (sit, down, stay and we are working on \"dogs in the kitchen\" which means all the dogs are to leave the kitchen area).  She is very spunky and loves riding in the car.  She does bark to alert you if someone is at the door.  Roxy can be a runner if given the chance \u2013 in her previous home she escaped the house on occasion and twice was hit by a car (she doesn\u2019t seem to have any residual issues from these).\n\nGood with dogs her size that aren\u2019t too pushy and she is living with a cat with no issues.  NO kids under 15 please.\n\nA dental was just completed and Roxy had to have 7 teeth pulled and she has a bit of arthritis but is otherwise healthy.\n\nRoxy is fully house trained and can use a dog door. \n",

It is likely she spent much of her life living outdoors, she\u2019s quickly learning what it means to be an indoor dog and thoroughly enjoys living the life of luxury. She\u2019s a friendly girl who greets every person she meets with the same excited enthusiasm. Her foster family is working on teaching her manners so she can be her best self. She enjoys romping around with her foster brother, all the snacks, and cuddling up with her people. Greta loves the dog she currently lives with, but it did take a few weeks, so she could possibly live with another calm dog if slowly introduced.  Greta will need an experienced adopter with the patience to continue teaching her manners and potty training (she is mostly trained but uses the occasional pee pad).  Greta would do best in a home with no children or with older children who are respectful of animals.",

            "description": "Look at that award winning smile! Lucas flashes it all the time outside where he enjoys playing with toys, being chased through the yard, or just sniffing around. He's never smiling in his kennel though where he spends most of his day. Lucas is one of those sweet dogs who just can't stand being cooped up at the shelter, and is finding the whole experience extremely stressful and depressing. He would like to get out of the shelter as soon as possible by going into a foster or forever home!\n\nLucas doesn't seem reactive to other dogs, and already seems to have some basic training on board but can be very pushy and jumpy at certain times.\n\nAt 2 yrs old and 53 lbs, Lucas is a lovely size, especially since much of his weight is soft silky golden coat! Because Lucas can be a lot when he is stressed or excited, he is looking for a family without children under 12 yrs old. He has been neutered, vaccinated, heart worm tested (negative), microchipped, and is current on parasite prevention.\n\nHOW TO FOSTER\nClick on tulsaspca.org/become-foster-parent and complete the Foster Application. You can follow up with foster@tulsaspca.org. Use subject line FOSTER LUCAS. Thank you for your interest in becoming a foster parent.\n\nHOW TO ADOPT\nThe Tulsa SPCA is currently operating on an appointment-only basis.\n- Click on the orange \"Interested in this animal? Click here!\" button to apply to adopt.\n- If you're approved, we'll contact you to finalize the paperwork, collect payment and arrange an appointment for your drive-thru adoption.\n- Please stay home if you feel unwell, especially if you are experiencing symptoms of fever, cough or sore throat.\nThank you for your patience and understanding during this time. These policies may change as the Tulsa SPCA makes adjustments in response to the ongoing situation.",

            "description": "I LOVE LONG WALKS IN THE WOODS!\n\nTHE BASICS:\n\nLab/Rottweiler mix; black and brindle\nADULT MALE; EST DOB: November 2018\nARRIVAL: October 10, 2020\nHISTORY:  Teddy was transferred from DCHS in South Carolina.  Teddy was an owner surrender to a high kill shelter.  The reason for surrender, \u201cHe\u2019s too shy.\u201d   Teddy really struggled at the county shelter and was an easy target to be put down so we spoke up for him before it was too late.  We\u2019re really glad we did!!\n \n\nWhen Teddy first arrived, he was scared and would bark at anyone who got too close, though he would never lunge or bite.  Teddy simply wanted to make it clear that he would like to be left alone.  Beneath his blustery exterior, though, is a really sweet dog.  When you look away from him he\u2019ll inch closer to sniff you.  He wants love, but he isn\u2019t sure how to open himself up to it just yet.  Some of our more dog-savvy volunteers are able to walk him and they can\u2019t praise him enough!  Once he gets over his apprehension enough to let someone put a leash on him, Teddy is a completely different dog.  He\u2019s friendlier and grows in confidence.  It will take time and patience to fully earn Teddy\u2019s trust, but we encourage you to come sit with this gentle, loving soul and help him feel more at ease.\n\nComments from Volunteer at County Kill Shelter:  I have a tail that wags!  Won\u2019t you come and check it out please?  Folks have been saying I am \u201cshy,\u201d in fact that was the reason my person turned me into the local shelter.  I would beg to differ (a bit!) \u2026.just ask the nice volunteers who got me out for a nice easy going walk along with 2 other well balanced dogs.   My tail wagged AND I smiled!  I did look both ways out of caution when I exited the busy shelter kennel area but the further I got from all the noise and chaos, the more relaxed I became.  Like many self respecting dogs,  I really don\u2019t want you to immediately drape yourself on me or get right in my face.  Please, won\u2019t you give me a wee bit of time for me to first check out YOU?  My tail was tightly tucked initially on our journey but as you can see from the photos,  I proudly put it on display once I was comfortable.  I am a pretty polite, mild mannered fellow who is sweet and gentle natured. A fenced in yard where I can run and explore and sniff and relax would be an incredible way for me to get some fresh air and exercise.  You should see me as I trot around with confidence in one of the fenced areas at the shelter!   Loud noise and lots of energy around me is not a great choice for me so a home with a more laid back couple (or person) perhaps with a well balanced dog (not sure i want some high energy, zooming dog to play with) to hang out with, would help me be at my best and love on YOU the best.    Ask for me, Teddy today won\u2019t you?",

            "description": "Macky came to the Shelter as a stray. He was very nervous when arriving - moving away from people and preferring to hide. After some office TLC at the Shelter with some confident dogs - Macky blossomed! Macky is currently in a foster home with one of our wonderful dog volunteers as well as two resident dogs - a large breed male dog and a smaller female dog. He is learning about all things dog and making great strides in his confidence. Macky gains a lot of confidence from following his foster dog brother and sister around. When the resident dogs to their moms for attention, Macky joins in in seeking out TLC! Slowly but surely, he has armed up to hanging out in his foster's laps and snuggling. Once Macky is comfortable, he LOVES pets and scratches. Macky is still working on housetraining and was recently neutered. Macky is a sweet guy who is looking for a patient person who is willing to take his transition into his new home slowly. A confident resident dog in the home is required. A home with cats may be appropriate with a slow introduction and management. Kids are not recommended in the home due to Macky's fear. JNG",

            "description": "This sweet, sweet girl is Tessa.\n\nK9 Kindness rescued Tessa and her three adult puppies from an outdoor living situation after their family experienced a tragedy. Tessa has been spayed and updated on all of her shots, so she is ready to find a brand new home. She is somewhat submissive and gets along with other dogs; it may just take her a while to come out of her shell. No cats, please. She is house-trained and will tolerate a kennel, but it's not her favorite place, can't say we blame her!\n\nIf you think a three year old, 50 pound, beautiful, dark brindle dog is too big for a lap dog, you haven't met Tessa. She is confident that she fits in just about anywhere. On the couch next to you is OK, but her head on your lap would be preferable. She's about 16 inches high at her shoulder and is a mixed breed. She walks well on a leash and is only moderately interested in toys.\n\nTessa is not a wild girl that needs to be entertained a lot - just a nice quiet laid-back girl who only wants to please you. This girl has a sweet and gentle soul and wants to be your companion and share your life.\n\nTessa is UTD on shots, preventative, micro-chipped, and spayed!\n\nTessa's adoption fee is $250, and adopters must live within 175 miles of the Quad City Area.\n\nIf interested in meeting Tessa you must fill out the online application at www.k9kindnessrescue.org/adopt/application\n\nTessa and K9 Kindness Rescue thank you for considering adoption through rescue for your new family companion!",

Smitty loves to run around and explore.  He enjoys fetching tennis balls but if he had to pick, stuffed animals are his favorite type of toy.  Smitty is a bit big to be a traditional lapdog, but that doesn't stop him from laying on you!  With all of his boundless energy, Smitty would definitely benefit from some training, time, and patience.  Once he has some obedience training under his belt, Smitty will make an excellent family dog for those with older children.  Smitty has a lot of love to give and deserves a loving home where he can be given pets, attention and plenty of space to run and play.",

We update our website daily just so you will know the status right away).  PLEASE GO TO OUR WEBSITE for up to date information to find out.  Check the Gallery by putting your mouse on the photo.  IF it says Pending, we chose someone, but they haven't met up yet.  If it says Adopted, then the dog has been happily united with a forever family.  IF nothing is there other than their name, they are still available.\n\nAPPLY if interested so you can be considered.?\n\n*Our page is updated daily. Please go to www.wowdogrescue.org for any updates.\n\nThe family of Stella and Piper have run up against a hardship.  The owner is having some medical issues and they are unable to hold on to these  2 sweet gals any longer.  They called us asking if we thought anyone would be able to keep these 2 together, as they enjoy each others company so much.  Most dog owners appreciate having 2 dogs that can entertain or comfort each other while they are away.\n\nStella is a light brown chi-weenie who is 1 yr old.  She is spay, chipped and up to date on immunization shots.  She loves her food so needs to ne portioned out for her vs leaving a bowl out all day.  She weighs in around 12 lbs.  She also is great with potty outside with a doggy door..\n\nPiper is the small black pup who is 8 mos old and they were told she is a Maltese / chihuahua mix.  She weighs in around  7 lbs.  She is also spay, Microchipped and up to date on immunization shots.  She knows the doggy door for potty too.\n\nBoth are a little shy at first but are fine with kids  but both are skittish at 1st. They seem fine with other small dogs and they have full run of the downstairs at night time.  If you are looking for a pair of sweet little girls who are young enough to learn you and your routines, please apply.\n\nAs a Bonded pair these 2 young girls adoption fee is set at $275.00\n\nWE ARE NOT PETFINDER.  WE ARE NOT ADOPTAPET, OR RESCUE ME.  Our application is on our website:  www.wowdogrescue.org \n\n**PLEASE do not call or email to see if they are \"still\" available.  The Gallery photo on our website will be updated daily and will state their status.  IF we have chosen someone, they will be marked \"Pending\".  IF they have been adopted, they will be marked \"Adopted\".\n\n***Tired of not finding, or not being chosen for the dog of your dream?? \n Consider Fostering with us...Our Fosters have 1st chance at adopting the dog they foster, while we pay for everything.  Its a win win for both! YOU get to see if this is a good match for your family, while the dog is being loved in your home...",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\n\nMixed breed puppiesHolly is such a sweet, mixed breed dog. We are totally guessing on her breed mix, she looks like a herding breed mix,could be a Canaan mixed dog: https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/canaan-dog/ or a Carolina dog mix https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/carolina-dog/ (lesser known breeds) but she looks similar to this. She could have some Shepherd, Husky or Heeler in her too? So again we are guessing on her breed mix.\n\nHolly is approximately 30 lbs and 2-3 years old. Holly came to us with 4 puppies. They were all in the pound together and a couple of the pups got parvo and they all spent a week at the vet getting treatments and were cleared of it on 12-30-20, having all survived.\n\nHolly is a sweet, sensitive under socialized soul. She is doing well in foster, and making progress but she will need an understanding home that will be patient with her. You have to kind of approach her like a cat, on her terms. She wants to be with you but on her own terms, until she can trust. She doesn't have an aggressive bone in her body but will flinch and avoid in fear. She loves the foster home's 15 year old daughter and even sleeps in her bed now with her, so you can see she craves companionship she just is choosy on who she trusts at this point.\n\nWe think she needs a home with a fenced in yard and another dog for security purposes and for her best life (Another dog to teach her confidence, and to soothe her psychologically).\n\nInterested in adopting? Please complete a pre-adoption application at https://redemptionroadrescue.rescuegroups.org/forms/form?formid=4003.\n\nhttp://redemptionroadrescue.rescuegroups.org\n\nAll animals fully vetted appropriate for age:\n\nSpayed or Neutered\nRabies vaccine\nDHPP vaccine\n4DX test (@12 months or older)\nMicrochipped\nDewormed\nFlea/tick prevention",

            "description": "McGinnis is a 4 year old Anatolian Shepherd/Great Pyrenees mix. He is a BIG boy & still trying to gain some weight with quality food & healthy toppings his foster mom spoils him with. \nMcGinnis is being fostered with 2 male cavalier King Charles spaniels and a dog-savvy 6 year old. Due to his size and playfulness, McGinnis is may not a good option for small children. Though he is kind to his foster brother dogs, he can be picky with others. So he will have to do a meet & greet to determine if it's a good fit. \nMcGinnis was found as a very underweight stray with a collar embedded in his neck. The collar was surgically removed and he was also neutered. He is heart worm negative & all healed now! McGinnis is VERY smart & would be best for someone familiar with Anatolians/Pyrenees. He can open latch doors on his own and is kitchen counter and table top height, though he is amazingly good at not attacking available food considering he easily could. McGinnis walks best on a leash with a gentle lead to reduce his pulling as he is so strong & would love to chase all wild rabbits and squirrels. McG does jump up when excited to meet new people at his foster home and would benefit from training. He gives his foster mom occasional kisses & loooooves belly rubs. He sleeps on a giant dog bed at the end of his foster mom's bed, but loves to dog-bed hop and try to fit in beds of any size. He has learned to enjoy car rides & despite initially being scared, ended up loving his first bath & towel rub down. He requires at least one walk a day or he is BORED. McGinnis keeps an eye on the guinea pigs in his foster home as well as human children when they are over to play. McGinnis is an incredibly smart, loyal, & loving dog who seeks a person or family that will appreciate him and take wonderful care of him for life! \n\nTo set up a meet and greet or inquire about a dog, please first fill out an application at https://savinghoperescue.org/contact. It doesn't obligate you, but it is the first step. We don't get to all of the inquiries but respond to all applications. Thank you for choosing to rescue!",

Anytime you see her and talk to her, her whole body wiggles in excitement! She loves getting back and butt scratches and just wiggles with joy when you pet her. She will give you sweet gentle kisses in return for snuggles! She is a calm, gentle girl that would be a great addition to almost any family. We don't know much about her past so we recommend she meet any potential \"dog siblings\" before going home with them. She is a very loving girl that anyone would be lucky to call their own! Capri deserves all the love in the world! She is such a sweet and happy girl. If you think she would be the perfect fit for you, fill out an adoption application and send it to adoptions@hsdayton.org so our staff can review it, and if approved, we will contact you about setting up a time to meet her!",

IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN FOSTERING OR ADOPTING LOU, PLEASE GO TO THE MAKE A DIFFERENCE RESCUE FACEBOOK PAGE AND SEND A PRIVATE MESSAGE THAT INCLUDES YOUR PHONE NUMBER AND EMAIL ADDRESS.\n\nLeo is a very handsome 1 1/2 year old Boxer mix. He is a very sweet boy who loves to snuggle. He loves to play with toys, peanut butter bones and absolutely loves to snuggle!! He is good with other dogs after a proper introduction. Unfortunately, we do not know how he is with cats. Children 10 years old or older. Leo's forever home must have a totally enclosed physically fenced yard where he can safely run, play and hang out with his people. He is neutered, up to date on his vaccinations, on heart worm preventative as well as house and crate trained. Leo is looking forward to becoming a very loved member of a forever family!!\n\nAll dogs we rescue stay with us until they find their forever homes. We do not do same day adoptions. A home visit is required to ensure our dog is going to a safe environment and our dog gets along with your dog(s) and/or cat(s). We require all our dogs over the age of 1 year attend 1 obedience class (6 week session) outside the home. You must live within 1 hour of Birmingham, MI to adopt one of our dogs. No out of state or outside the U.S. adoptions or fosters. Leo's adoption fee is $275.",

Mimi we believe is a mixed breed Staffy and Lab, the best of both worlds. She does have the sweetest nature and loves to play with other dogs. She will get along well with little or big dogs, and she loves to cuddle with her human. Mimi will need a fenced in back yard with a loving family. She will be great around kids as well.

            "description": "Sharky is a handsome 7-year-old male Havanese that weighs 16 pounds. He is the sweetest little guy that will make the perfect companion for anyone! He is blind from advanced cataracts, but can navigate a home and yard once he figures out his surroundings. He loves exploring the backyard, enjoys the company of other dogs, is fantastic with small kids, and is very social. He is an easy going and low maintenance dog. He is neutered, vaccinated, heartworm negative, and microchipped. He is $350 plus TX sales tax with an approved application: www.recycledpomsbcs.com/adopt\n\nTexas law requires that all humane organizations (Rescues, SPCA's, Humane Societies, State nonprofit, and charitable 501c3 exempt orgs) collect and remit sales and use tax to the Texas Comptroller on their adoption fees.\n\nWe do not ship or transport our dogs. We require all adopters to meet the dog in person to ensure it is a good fit. We represent the dog to the best of our ability and since they are in rescue, we do not always get their history.\n\nPlease note: We are a non-profit Pomeranian Rescue with dogs in private foster homes. We do not have a facility open to the public. We require an approved application before a potential adopter is introduced to a dog. We contact vet references to ensure animals in the home are current on vaccinations, heart worm prevention, and sterilization. We do not adopt our dogs to homes in which an animal is not spayed or neutered. A home visit may be required.\n\nPlease visit our website for more information and an adoption application. www.recycledpomsbcs.com",

            "description": "Chihuahua Mix \u2013 Female \u2013 9 lbs \u2013 5 yrs (approx.)\n\nPaddy is a 9 lb., 5-year-old female Chihuahua mix coming to us from a Tennessee shelter. She is chocolate brown with a tan and brown brindle face. She is micro chipped, has had her teeth cleaned and received her rabies in March of 2020. There are no known health issues.\n\nThis wee girl has had a very tough 5 years making her an exceptionally fearful dog. Paddy lived in a hoarding situation her entire life until rescued earlier in 2020. She was placed in a foster home in Tennessee until she could come to us, which she did July 31.\n\nShe is extremely fearful of new people and will curl into a ball facing the wall. She has a hard time meeting other dogs, keeping them away with aggressive growls. I believe this is caused from her poor start where she had to fight for food with the other dogs in her situation. to escape being close to them. In new situations, she is prone to defense biting when cornered and pursued, which intensifies her already extremely high level of fear.\n\nWhen she first came to me in July, she was in a restricted living area, usually curled up into a tight ball facing the back of the carrier, not making eye contact and snarling if one of the house dogs got too close to the pen. She especially did not like the cats getting close, she will lunge and snarl at them. She did come out and eat and take treats left for her only if no people or dogs were in the room.\n\nToday she has full reign of the house. She has bonded with the dogs, running and wrestling with them, playing fetch and sleeping with them on the couch, where she doesn\u2019t mind the cats sleeping beside her. She is definitely food motivated, loving her meals and treat times. She lines up with the pack at the kitchen door when I am in the kitchen, hoping something drops which she can scoop.\n\nWhen I come in, she is with the pack at the door greeting me with a wriggling body and wagging tail! In the house she has become my shadow. She will take treats from my hand, gives me lots of little kisses \u2013 on my feet or ankles. She has just started to let me tickle her chin, only a couple of flicks and she backs away. This is the first contact she has allowed.\n\nPaddy has made great strides and will continue to do so if allowed the time and security to do so in her own time. She is in no way over her fear and lack of trust of people and new animals, but she has started on this journey of acceptance. One can see it in her face and behavior.\n\nShe needs a home where her people have the patience and understanding to allow her to continue developing her trust of people and animals. She should go to a mature and quiet home. Definitely no children. A fenced yard is a must as she is a flight risk. It would benefit Paddy to have a calm canine sibling, so she can learn the appropriate behaviors.\n\nHer forever people need to understand that she is definitely a work in progress and that she might never be a cuddly girl but with their help she will be a loving girl.\n\nFor more information on Paddy, please contact Jackie at jackie.brossard1952@gmail.com\n\nOR visit our website: www.savemedogrescue.ca\n\n** Adoptions within the province of Ontario only",

Whatever shampoo she's using on her hair is what I want because that fur shimmer is soft and inviting. Lady is a nearly four-year-old Retriever, Labrador/Mix who is the perfect dog for someone who wants a bigger dog who is not overwhelming. At forty-seven-pounds she has pretty much reached her full size unless you go treat crazy which is pretty easy with such a loving dog. Lady has been enjoying other dogs and greets people in a friendly fashion. The thing about Lady is that she plays nicely with other dogs in a group or on walks but she loves being the only dog in the home. For that reason we believe she will be best in a home where she can get and give all the doggy love and not worry about competition. Four is a great age to add a dog into your home but even though she has already developed some nice manners she will have to learn the ins and outs of your home and she will get acclimated soon. If you have a thing for black dogs with happy smiles then you'll want to see Lady soon. She lives up to her name in every way! Lady is up to date on her vaccinations, is spayed, and will be microchipped before going to her forever home.

            "description": "Lilly is a 7 year old 4 lbs Chihuahua mix who is currently looking for her fur-ever home. She is up to date on vaccines, dewormed, and spayed. \n\nRescued from: Los Angeles area. \nLikes: She likes her soft food in a saucer ( easier to eat from) & loves to roll on her back (see video) She has no teeth & loves treats she can eat.\nDislikes: When new people come to visit or knock on the door. She suddenly finds her very loud barking voice. Tell her \u201cNo \u201c and she does quiet down after a while.\nIdeal Home: Lily\u2019s ideal home will have another small easy-going dog & no children and no large breed dogs. Have access to a backyard as she does not like walks. Have patience with housetraining and be very gentle with this extra small girl.\nEnergy Level: Low. \nExperience with Kids: Unknown but not recommended. \nExperience with cats: Unknown.\nMedical Needs: Lily had some mammary tumors removed and they were benign. There is a slight chance they may come back in other places.\nTraining Needs: Lily is working in house training. She uses pee pads & seems familiar with them. A backyard where u can let her out often would be helpful for her small bladder.\n\nFrom Lilly's Foster: \nLily is a confident & sassy, sweet little girl. She has bursts of energy and then wants to cuddle in a blanket. She will follow you everywhere to see what you are doing. She sits nicely in the morning after getting up, as she knows breakfast is coming. She could use a little more weight, so gets fed soft food 3 times a day. She is a smart little girl but does not like walks, but think that will change once summer is here. She has started to reverse sneeze whee when she eats too fast or gets excited. She will be a great companion & enjoys another small dog. Due to her small size, her home will need to have no larger breed dogs & children in it.\n\n\n\nAs all of our dogs are currently in private foster homes if you would like more in-depth information about this dog, Please follow us on facebook at www.facebok.com/fureverhomesdogs and attend our adoption events to meet our current adoptables and fill out an adoption application.\n\nFur-ever Homes Rescue is a registered Canadian Charity run entirely by volunteers and generous donations. \n\nhttp://www.fur-everhomesrescue.com/",

            "description": "Meet Benjamin Button. He\u2019s a sweet, dog/cat friendly, 15 lb senior poodle [exact age not known but he could be 15] who is deaf and mostly blind. He was found as a stray and had clearly suffered from neglect for a long period of time. When his foster first picked him up, it seemed he had no spirit left in him. Luckily, with some TLC and a much needed dental surgery, Benjamin is starting to come back to life. \n\nDespite being blind/deaf, this little guy is pretty adaptable once he figures out his space and routine. If he does get lost or needs something, he will communicate with you through a bark. \n\nI think his bio might be misleading. People will see 10 year old poodle and think he\u2019s still pretty young.  \n\nBB enjoys using his nose to find hidden treats around the house, sniffing around the backyard and napping in comfy beds. If you give him a good neck scratch and some yummy treats, he will love you forever! \n\nBenjamin deserves a loving home, but an adopter should know that he's in the later stages of being a senior and will not be a dog that wants to go on walks or do much besides sleep, eat and wander. \n\nWe are still evaluating Benjamin Button\u2019s cognitive health, so be sure to check back for updates! An adopter for Benjamin would need to be prepared for an adjustment period until he figures out his space and routine.",

She is up to date on vaccines, dewormed, and spayed. \n\nRescued from: Los Angeles area. \nLikes: Chasing and catching balls, stuffed toys, and snuggling.\nDislikes: Being picked up, being on her back & doesn't like riding in the car but the more exposure she gets, the better she is.\nIdeal Home: Wendy's ideal home would be a home with another dog. Detached home due to barking at things when she looks out the window and a securely fenced yard.\nEnergy Level: Medium. \nExperience with Kids: Unknown.\nExperience with cats: Unknown.\nMedical Needs: None at this time.\nTraining Needs: Wendy needs some basic training, she walks well on a loose leash and really enjoys being with her people. Wendy is currently working with our dog training to help her overcome her anxiety related to meeting new people and new dogs. She can be a bit shy/ fearful in those situations. She is pee pad trained.\n\nFrom Wendy's Foster: \nWendy is a very loving dog. She's very playful first thing in the morning and will bring you a toy to throw while you are getting ready. She loves to play fetch with a ball and loves stuffed toys that she can shake. She enjoys playing tug of war but she won't give up. Wendy is fearful of new people and will run and hide. It takes Wendy sometimes to trust people and learn that they aren't going to hurt her. With lots of love and patience, Wendy will bond with you and then becomes your best friend. She has similar behavior to new dogs she meets and it takes her some time to warm up, however, once she is comfortable she does enjoy playing. Wendy doesn't really like to be picked up but she does enjoy sitting on your lap. Wendy is a sweet and loving girl who may appear shy at first but given time, will turn into your best friend...Are you Wendy's new best friend??\n\nAs all of our dogs are currently in private foster homes if you would like more in-depth information about this dog, Please follow us on facebook at www.facebok.com/fureverhomesdogs and attend our adoption events to meet our current adoptables and fill out an adoption application.\n\nFur-ever Homes Rescue is a registered Canadian Charity run entirely by volunteers and generous donations. \n\nhttp://www.fur-everhomesrescue.com/",

She is up to date on vaccines, dewormed, and spayed. \n\nRescued from: Local surrender.\nLikes: Playing tug-o-war, going for walks, playing fetch & snuggling (a LOT!). Running around the yard & playing with her people.\n\nDislikes: Being left alone, Being ignored & Car rides.\nIdeal Home: Vanni's ideal home will have someone home for the majority of the day. She needs lots of love, patience, and reassurance. She needs someone with some dog training experience (or a willingness to learn) as she is still working through some bad habits.\nEnergy Level: Medium.\nExperience with Kids: Yes, ok. \nExperience with cats: Yes, ok.\nMedical Needs: Vanni has epilepsy and is on medication to control it. Vanni also has food allergies and is on a hypoallergenic diet.\n\nTraining Needs: Vanni is working on manners while she is on a leash and she is also learning to stay away from kitchen counters and the kitchen table She is very smart and motivated by food so that will be helpful with training. \n\nFrom Vanni's Foster: \nVanni has been with us for almost 3 months and after a week of getting to know one another, we absolutely fell in love with her. She is patient with children, loves to be snuggled, and gets along very well with other dogs and cats. Vanni loves being around people and she believes wholeheartedly that she is a lap dog. Once she warms up to you Vanni will follow you everywhere and sleep at your feet (or, preferably, on you) if you're sitting and relaxing. She needs a family that has patience and is able to work with her every day. Vanni does not like to be left alone and has separation anxiety when she doesn't feel safe and her people are not nearby. She is probably the sweetest dog we have ever fostered and will make her forever family feel lucky to have her.\nlove to give and a family with a lot of patience. She will be your best friend for life once she trusts you.\n\nAs all of our dogs are currently in private foster homes if you would like more in-depth information about this dog, Please follow us on facebook at www.facebok.com/fureverhomesdogs and attend our adoption events to meet our current adoptables and fill out an adoption application.\n\nFur-ever Homes Rescue is a registered Canadian Charity run entirely by volunteers and generous donations. \n\nhttp://www.fur-everhomesrescue.com/",

Update: Ursula's adoption fee has been partially sponsored by Dennis and Nadine and will be reduced to $175 plus tax.  Meet Ursula!  This sweet girl is a little timid here but we think she is just subdued due to the commotion that happens on a dailiy basis here.  Once she gets comfortable we know she will be less timid.  If you don't know anything about Catahoulas here's some brief information but we encourage you to do your research.  Catahoula Leopard Dogs are natural born hunters and herders.  They need exercise, training and direction or they get bored easily. They are not usually a good apartment dog.   They are wonderful for the right home.  We are unsure of what's she's mixed with.  Ursula lived with other dogs in the Alabama rescue she was at but she was adopted and didn't get along with another dog in the home.  She got along with male dogs really well at the rescue.  We are currently searching for a home where she can be the only dog.  Ursula does well on car rides and started crate training in her previous home.  If you're looking for one of a kind, check out Ursula!  \n\nI am fixed, current on my rabies, distemper and kennel cough vaccinations. I am heartworm negative(dogs 6 months and older are tested at CCHS) and started on heartworm prevention. I have been de-wormed and I have also been microchipped. I will also be inspected by\na vet and receive a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection. If you are interested in me, please head to the CCHS website at www.cchswi.org and fill out an application.

This little angel was found as a stray, fending for herself and her unborn babies. She was a great mother to them and now it\u2019s her turn to find her forever family. Sugar is about 3 years old and is amazing with children and other dogs. She cannot be in a home with indoor or outdoor small animals such as rodents, chickens, ducks etc, because of her high prey drive. (no exceptions) she is a very smart girl and very playful!! She will drown you in snuggles and kisses. You just have to meet her to believe how awesome she is.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Sugar please copy and paste our application link into your browser and complete at:\n\nhttps://daniellethedogrescuer.wufoo.com/forms/zq5l29b022pyq0/\n\nPlease no calls or texts. We will process your application and get back to you.\n\nAdopter must be located within a 30 mile radius of Trinity, Florida 34655\n",

            "description": "Jasmine is a 2 year old sweetheart. As you can probably see from her photos she did not have a great past but she doesn\u2019t let that keep her from loving everyone. \nJasmine came into the shelter filled with shot gun pellets, and trauma to her eye which ultimately resulted in her losing her eye. \n\nBecause of Jasmines past she will need an adopter who is home a lot of the time as she has separation anxiety which she is currently on medication for and responding very well to. When Jasmine was at animal control down south she wanted to be with people so much she would do anything to get to them including hurting herself.  Jasmine truly just needs someone to be her life long companion to give her the love she deserves.\n\nJasmine is your typical young adult dog she loves to go on adventures but also loves to snuggle and relax with her foster too! \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adopting Jasmine please visit our website using the link below, download our application and send it to us through email at Humblehounds@outlook.com\n\nhttps://humblehounds.org/adoption-process",

He isn't too sure about what's going on yet and seems a little timid but we think with a few days in learning our routine around here and getting use to the shelter, he will start to come out of his shell.  Trey is Lab sized.  He seems really smart and will catch on to anything you want to teach him.  Right now, we wouldn't recommend him with young kids because they would most likely be too overwhelming for him at this time.  If you're interested in adoption, please apply at www.cchswi.org \n\nI am fixed, current on my rabies, distemper and kennel cough vaccinations. I am heartworm negative(dogs 6 months and older are tested at CCHS) and started on heartworm prevention. I have been de-wormed and I have also been microchipped. I will also be inspected by\na vet and receive a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection. If you are interested in me, please head to the CCHS website at www.cchswi.org and fill out an application.

Whenever people come up to me, I can't help but wiggle my butt hoping to get some scratches and my favorite head rubs. I get along well with all dogs and while I haven't been tested with cats, with proper introduction I think I will love them too! I haven\u2019t been tested with kids, but my foster parents think I will be a great growing up buddy, because I am very friendly and I take treats so gently. I would prefer a family with another dog to keep me company or a family who would keep me by their side since I am still little and not used to be alone by myself. I am food motivated; I learned to sit for treats quickly, and with some proper training I will be your perfect pup. I am also crate trained, no accident at all in my crate so far. I love to play with all toys and the occasional shoe but I'm a quick learner and can be redirected back to my toys easily. I am pretty good at keeping myself occupied with my toys when my foster parents are working at their desk, so if you work from home I'll mind my manners and be ready to love on you when you take a break! Pick me to be your forever pup! Rizzo is a Black Lab mix, weighs 26 lbs (but growing!) and was born approximately 9/23/2020. She is spayed, vaccinated, microchipped, given flea/tick preventive, dewormed & started on heartworm preventive. Adoption fee is $550 to help offset the many expenses we have for vetting costs. We rely strictly on adoption fees and donations to continue to save the lives of orphaned & abandoned pets; 100% goes towards their care. If interested in adopting one of our available dogs or puppies, please complete an online adoption application at https://dollyslegacyanimalrescue.org/adopt/ You will be contacted by our adoption coordinator via email after your application has been reviewed & approved to schedule an appointment.",

            "description": "Please contact Linda for more information about this pet.Meet the beautiful Anna! '\nTo start Anna is only being rehomed because they have a kitty. No other reason given. This is the owners story of ANNA!\n\nAnna is a pretty girl that gets lots of compliments. She is very much a typical shepherd in that she loves to be with her people. She has been a mostly indoor dog, with time spent in the backyard to play and go to the bathroom. She's playful and affectionate and although she still has some puppy energy, she settles easily and naps often. She was raised with another dog and two young children. Her size might annoy my 3 year old son sometimes, but I often find him laughing while they play together in the yard. Her basic manners and commands are strong. She doesn't jump, knows not to get on the couch or bed, and will sit and wait for her food even though she's very excited. She has never exhibited any food or toy aggression.\n\nShe's intelligent and curious, but definitely needs these tendencies to have a productive outlet. She's very food motivated so training with treats is quite effective. She has had a lot of experience walking around the neighborhood with our dog, kids, strollers, and my son on his scooter. I use a front clip harness and she rarely pulls. She enjoys and benefits from regular walks. It doesn't take much to wear her out thankfully.\n\nShe has socialized with other dogs and people on a limited basis due to Covid. But she has spent time with other family dogs while on a family trip to Tahoe. And it went well! When people do visit, she's always friendly and receptive to visitors.\n\nShe is fully potty trained and now sleeps loose in our bedroom on her dog bed.\n\nCome see this pup on Saturdays during adoption event hours. Please email Linda at lbredfire@sbcglobal.net or call WT&F's Dog Team voicemail 707-812-9030 to get a jump on the process, ask questions, and/or to confirm they will be there. Dog adoptions are held outside Napa Petco every Saturday - 12:30pm to 4:00pm.\nThis dog comes spayed/neutered, microchipped, vaccinated, dewormed, heartworm tested negative, and more with an adoption fee/donation to Whiskers, Tails and Ferals in Napa, CA. See more information at http://whiskerstailsandferals.org/.\nVisit our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/whiskerstailsandferals/",

His paperwork lists him as about 1 year old but his teeth look like he might be 4 years old. But that's ok because Larry is so cool! He is on the smaller side too so if you're looking for a good medium-sized dog apply to meet him. Maybe a good judge for size for him would be to imagine a beagle but just a bit bigger. Larry is very sweet and loves attention. He likes to lean on you and get scratches right behind his ears. Larry is pretty new here so we are still discovering things about him but if you're interested in meeting him, please head to our website www.cchswi.org\n\nI am fixed, current on my rabies, distemper and kennel cough vaccinations. I am heartworm negative(dogs 6 months and older are tested at CCHS) and started on heartworm prevention. I have been de-wormed and I have also been microchipped. I will also be inspected by\na vet and receive a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection. If you are interested in me, please head to the CCHS website at www.cchswi.org and fill out an application.

She is an active senior at 9 1/2 years young. \nAdorable and a lovely mix of Chihuahua and terrier to make for a cute and compact 40lb. medium-sized doll. Eloise has such a bright spirit and is ready to go anytime. She will get you out for walks, make you laugh, give you love, and cuddle with you! She prefers a calmer household so no kiddo's or other pets please.  She is Ok with apt living as long as she gets ample time outdoors with walks. If you have a yard, even better!  She will do best with an experienced owner rather than a first-time pup parent. \n\nEloise really wants you to herself and is not into other dogs. She can get overly excited if they get to close but responds to redirection. She walks well on the leash, is house trained, knows a few tricks and has a bright personality that keeps you smiling and on your toes. This cutie pie loves human companionship, will be your best friend, and will take ear scratches and belly rubs as often as you will give them.  She will take a little time to settle into your home, and we will give you tips on how to ease her in. She is in great health and shows no signs of slowing down. She is current on all shots, spayed, and micro-chipped.\nUpon adoption we will provide a transition session!\nEmail: dog.sos@yahoo.com",

Due to their early starvation, they have some limb deformity, but they get around & play like any puppy and it doesn't seem to slow them down. We are hopeful that as they receive proper nutrition & TLC, as they grow their crooked legs will straighten out. Hobbes is a growing male Hound mix pup born approximately 10-2-20. He is neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, given flea/tick preventive, dewormed & started on heartworm preventive. Adoption fee is $575 to help offset the many expenses we have for vetting costs. We rely strictly on adoption fees and donations to continue to save the lives of orphaned & abandoned pets; 100% goes towards their care. If interested in adopting one of our available dogs or puppies, please complete an online adoption application at https://dollyslegacyanimalrescue.org/adopt/ You will be contacted by our adoption coordinator via email after your application has been reviewed & approved to schedule an appointment.",

We don't believe that any of them have ever really had the opportunity to be true dogs before. Most of their previous time was spent in crates. Due to this, Abby does take a minute to open up as she needs to see that she can trust you before she does. Once she does open up she is such a sweet and loving girl. Abby is potty trained and crate trained. She needs to find the perfect home where she has a loyal companion and family to love. Abby does have an appointment to get spayed as she was used for breeding in the past. She will NOT be available to take home until her spay appointment, We want to work extra hard to find her the best home possible so it is ready for her to come home to with open arms.",

We found out during out photo session that he really likes toys.  He has a good drive to play and chase toys.   O'Neal will need an active home.  Catahoula Leopard Dogs are natural born hunters and herders.  They need exercise, training and direction or they get bored easily. They are not usually a good apartment dog.  O'Neal has fantastic ears!  Check them out!  He is very loving and likes to be involved with whatever you are doing.  Can you give O'Neal an appropriate home for his needs?  Apply at www.cchswi.org  \n\nI am fixed, current on my rabies, distemper and kennel cough vaccinations. I am heartworm negative(dogs 6 months and older are tested at CCHS) and started on heartworm prevention. I have been de-wormed and I have also been microchipped. I will also be inspected by\na vet and receive a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection. If you are interested in me, please head to the CCHS website at www.cchswi.org and fill out an application.

Pier is a 2 year old shepherd mix and weighs approximately 55 lbs. She is an active, playful dog with a great disposition. She's a great running companion and hiker.\n\nShe has a gorgeous brindle coat with a black saddle. She has been with large and small dogs and seems to be 'dog selective'. She seems to be better with medium and large dogs. We would like to see her be the only dog in the home; it would be an easier transition for her and her new family.\n\nIf you would like to meet Piper, please complete our adoption application. Due to Covid-19, our weekly adoption events have been suspended. We do conduct meet-and-greets. All potential adopters must complete our adoption application prior to scheduling a meet-and-greet. You can complete our adoption application online at https://www.tailsofthecityrescue.org/adopt-application.\n\nWe are located in LOS ANGELES, CA, we DO NOT adopt outside of the Southern California area (as we require physical homechecks), nor will we ship dogs to other parts of the country or out of the country, please do not ask.\n\n\n\n",

He enjoys playing with other dogs and is currently living with a cat. They are great playmates. IAN has a gentle personality and would be great with kids. He LOVES being outdoors, so an active home/family would be best.  He is also super snuggly and loves to cuddle. He knows the puppy handshake. He is not fond of being in a crate. His foster Dad says he apparently likes to look at himself in the mirror!  See pic. Why not! He's gorgeous. I have a video of him. IAN is due to arrive in the Phila. area on 2/7.

We took him, Abby and their puppy in order to find them the best life possible. While Rocky is a great dog that deserves all the love he does take a little while to open up. We suspect this is due to his past as he opening up more and more every day. His favorite activity is running around playing with his toys. He will take his toy with him everywhere if you let him. He does tend to be a little bit more reserved around men but is not aggressive towards them. Rocky is crate trained and has an appointment to get neutered. He will NOT be available to take home until his neuter is complete. However, we want to have his perfect home arranged and ready to go at that time as we know he is anxiously awaiting a forever human.",

Emerald is a little unsure of the shelter situation and seems a bit timid but she just came up from Alabama and seems like she's a little overwhelmed.  But, Emerald starts to come out of her shell the more you baby talk to her.  We think she just needs to get comfortable.  She also loves treats and will follow the crinkle of a bag anywhere!  If you're interested in adoption, apply at www.cchswi.org \n\nI am fixed, current on my rabies, distemper and kennel cough vaccinations. I am heartworm negative(dogs 6 months and older are tested at CCHS) and started on heartworm prevention. I have been de-wormed and I have also been microchipped.

            "description": "Due to COVID-19, CITY DOGS is currently doing adoptions by APPOINTMENT ONLY. Please visit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog to request a meet and greet! \n\nQuestions? Email: citydogs@city.cleveland.oh.us | Call: (216) 664-3476\nVisit: 9203 Detroit Avenue Cleveland, OH 44102\n\nHours:\n10 AM - 3 PM Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday\n10 AM - 6 pm Tuesday & Thursday\n\nFee: $61 | Includes spay/neuter, shots, microchip, license, 30 days free pet insurance (when registered upon adoption)\n\nThe CITY DOGS mission is to increase adoptions from the City Kennel by changing the image of the pit bulls who make up the majority of the kennel population, by preparing all adoptable dogs in the kennel for lives in loving homes and by creating as many opportunities as possible for the public to meet and get to know our dogs for the terrific pets they are meant to be.\n\nOur Adoption Process...\nHere's a little about how things work:\nAll of the CITY DOGS posted for adoption are available for direct adoption from the kennel, unless noted otherwise. You must schedule a meet with a dog in advance - we are not currently accepting walk-ins. Please look online first to see if there are any dogs you think would be a good fit for your home before scheduling a meet. To get the process started, visit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog and fill out the form. One of our adoption counselors will get in touch to schedule and confirm your meet! At the kennel, an adoption counselor will introduce you and your family to the adoptable dogs, share information we know about them, and discuss our suggested ways for successfully integrating a new dog into your home. You are welcome to meet multiple dogs. If the dog you adopt is already fixed, he or she may leave with you that day - otherwise, the dog can go home after receiving the spay or neuter surgery.)\n\nAbout Our Dogs: All available dogs have gone through a behavioral and medical assessment. This assessment is a snapshot of who the dog is at that given time. We cannot make any guarantees with regard to behavior, temperament or health of any City Dog once they are in the home. Most of our dogs are picked up as strays, so we do not know what kind of home environment they were living in (i.e. with kids, other dogs or other cats), nor do we know if most of them are house trained. Everything we know about them is based on volunteer and staff observations. We do have some dogs in foster homes, where they will have more information about how the dog is in a home environment. It is very hard to tell with certainty whether or not a dog will be good with kids, cats or another dog. If you have kids in the home or another dog, we do require that they be present for a meet and greet with the dog you are considering for adoption.\n\nHeath/Vaccinations: Dogs that are adopted directly from the kennel need to go to your personal vet within two weeks of leaving the kennel. All dogs receive their DAPPL, Rabies, and Bordatella vaccines, though you may be required to get follow up boosters. All dogs come microchipped and with a Cuyahoga County license.?  \n\n\n\n \n",

IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN FOSTERING OR ADOPTING CARTER, PLEASE GO TO THE MAKE A DIFFERENCE RESCUE PAGE AND SEND A PRIVATE MESSAGE THAT INCLUDES YOUR PHONE NUMBER AND EMAIL ADDRESS.\n\nCarter is a very handsome 2.5 year old Terrier mix. Carter and his brother Benji were living on the streets of Detroit. We were contacted to save them and now they are enjoying a warm place to live, good food and lots of loving. Carter is pretty energetic, goofy and lots of fun!! He loves peanut butter bones and playing with toys. He is working on learning basic commands and is treat motivated. Children 10 years old or older. Carter is good with other dogs after a slow introduction is done. Unfortunately, We do not know how Carter is with cats. His forever home must have a totally enclosed physically fenced yard where he can safely run, play and hang out with his people. Carter is neutered, up to date on his vaccinations, on heart worm preventative as well as house and crate trained. Carter loves to snuggle and adores being petted. Carter cannot wait to share his love with his forever family . . . is that you??\n\nAll dogs we rescue stay with us until they find their forever homes. We do not do same day adoptions. A home visit is required to ensure our dog is going to a safe environment and our dog gets along with your dog(s) and/or cat(s). We require all our dogs over the age of 1 year attend 1 obedience class (6 week session) outside the home. You must live within 1 hour of Birmingham, MI to adopt one of our dogs. No out of state or outside the U.S. adoptions or fosters. Carter's adoption fee is $275.",

Fiona is crate trained and housebroken. If left uncrated, she'd rather snooze on the couch than destroy the house. Adopt Fiona today for the world's best little spoon and cuddle sesh! \n\nFiona is about 10 years old and weighs about 52 pounds.\n\nIf you're interested in meeting Fiona, please visit our website to learn about our adoption process and to fill out an application, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs and cats will be micro-chipped, spayed or neutered, and up-to-date on vaccinations at the time of adoption. For more photos of Fiona, follow us on Facebook Gateway Pet Guardians and Instagram @gatewaypets ... #gpgFiona. \n\nTo view other adoptable pets from our shelter, please visit, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nGateway Pet Guardians is proud to offer a variety of mixed breed dogs available for adoption. However, please keep in mind that we rarely know the genetic background of the animals we rescue and, as such, we cannot guarantee the exact breed combinations found within this dog. However, we do not know his/her actual genetic makeup. Just know that this dog is probably a variety of several different breeds that have combined to create one very amazing and unique animal.",

I am looking for a quiet home with one or more adults. Even though I like children, I mostly hide from them because they are too busy and loud for me. I am super quiet myself. I don\u2019t bark and when I talk to you, I offer a very soft whine to let you know I want to go outside or cuddle. I LOVE sitting next to your lap and cuddling in your bed (if you will let me). At night, I like going my own bed - my crate with the door open is my most comfortable space. I sleep all the time, until you want me to cuddle. I won\u2019t bother you while you work (or asleep) and I will follow you around just to be in the same room as you! Right now, I am not big on walks - I don\u2019t like the cold and I am not quite sure how the leash works. My foster family took me on a road trip and I was the perfect car passenger. I hung out in my crate or on a lap. I did really well following the directions in the guest house we stayed at for a few days. I love traveling and will love traveling with my forever adult(s). A few more things about me, it will take me a while to warm up to you. I was quite nervous around my foster family for about a month until I figured out how things went around there. I never bite or show my teeth, I\u2019m a good boy! I am not food motivated and still need to learn a few commands such as sit, stay and come but I know I can learn them (if you want me to). I need eye drops 2-3 times a day (just the over the counter kind) because my tear ducts are permanently blocked. That\u2019s why I have dark circles under my eyes. I originally came from a hoarding situation and was given a second chance at a good life with CCHS. If you\u2019re interested in me, please head to the website to apply.  www.cchswi.org\n\n I am fixed, current on my rabies, distemper and kennel cough vaccinations. I am heartworm negative(dogs 6 months and older are tested at CCHS) and started on heartworm prevention. I have been de-wormed and I have also been microchipped. I will also be inspected by\na vet and receive a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection. If you are interested in me, please head to the CCHS website at www.cchswi.org and fill out an application.

            "description": "Angel is an active, beautiful, smart girl who will benefit from a consistent daily routine that includes exercise and play. She would love an owner to take her for daily runs or learn to bicycle with her! She even once went skateboarding with an experienced rider (one of her fosters), and she was wiped out when they got home! She learns quickly, and with a calm, guiding hand to help her continue to hone her manners, she will be a wonderful addition to your household! Per her previous owners, Angel is housebroken! She should not go to a home with cats, but she may potentially be able to live with the right canine companion. Because of her energy and intelligence levels, Angel needs to go to a home with dog ownership experience. She just may be a bit too much for young human siblings, due to her tendency to use her mouth more when she is over-aroused. If you are looking for an active dog to fit your lifestyle, come meet Angel today. She is as smart as she is beautiful - and has the personality and the voice to match!\n Primary Color: Black Secondary Color: Tan Weight: 47.25lbs Age: 1yrs 4mths 2wks Animal has been Spayed",

He's wild on the leash at times due to never having those boundaries put in place. He does well with other dogs but will need a dog that can handle his energy level and him wanting to play. Because, boy! Is he a player! He's just as full of love as he is of energy though. His foster loved him so so much but ultimately had to bring him back because he wasn't able to provide Valentine with the outlet that he really needs.",

            "description": "MEET Bailey! Bailey is a 60lb, 3 year old lab mix. This goofy, playful lady is looking for an adult and teen (15+) only home that is outside of the city, ideally in a more rural or suburban area. While it is not required, she would definitely enjoy having a fenced in back yard. She is looking for an active family who can keep up with all of her energy and who can help her learn that new people and objects are not so scary. Here in the shelter, she has shown us that while she can be friends with other dogs, she would prefer to be an only dog. We do not know how she would be with cats or with other animals. In the right environment, she is a very sweet girl who enjoys getting pets and showing off just how wiggly her bum is! She is very food motivated and while she does known some basic commands such as sit, she would benefit from more positive reinforcement training. If you are looking to add a sweet lady to your family, Bailey may be the girl for you! This animal is currently up to date on all vaccinations, has been spayed, microchipped and been seen by our vet team. If you are interested in adopting this animal, please fill out our web form, available here: Dedham Adoption Inquiry Form! You can expect a response to your inquiry from a member of our adoption staff within 48 hours of completing this form. Due to our high volume of inquiries, please refrain from calling unless that time frame has passed. If needed, you can reach the Dedham shelter at 617-426-9170 x605. The Animal Rescue League of Boston is currently operating by appointment only Tuesday-Sunday 1pm-6pm. Our Adoption Forward process will start with a phone conversation.

            "description": "Update: 01/28/21 16:02 Bruno was adopted and then shortly returned. Bruno did great and had no issues but adopters other pet felt it should be a one dog house hold. Reason for return: other pet did not get along with new pet. ml 01/21/21 Update: 01/20/21 13:26 Took out to play yard. Dog leashes easily and walks on leash but is very stong and pulls. No aggression seen when passing other dogs. Knows the sit command and will sit for treats and toys. Playful and puppy like, enjoys playing fetch. Adopter needs to anticipate having to provide training. Dog has a lot of energy and lacks manners (Jumps up in face, jumps on tables to get treats...). JS 01/16/21 08:37 Really nice dog. High energy.. needs training.JD",

He is a big lug who overall seems pretty low-key - though you certainly don't want to count him out for activity! He has a playful, curious streak and enjoys sniffing around on walks. Though he is a strong, sturdy guy, he generally makes for a decent walking companion. And we think he'll be perfectly happy to spend lots of time being a couch potato and snuggle buddy! Corduroy was social with other dogs for his play group assessment. He is estimated to be around 6 years old and weighs 75 lbs.\nDue to COVID-19, CITY DOGS is currently doing adoptions by APPOINTMENT ONLY. Please visit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog to request a meet and greet! \n\nQuestions? Email: citydogs@city.cleveland.oh.us | Call: (216) 664-3476\nVisit: 9203 Detroit Avenue Cleveland, OH 44102\n\nHours:\n10 AM - 3 PM Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday\n10 AM - 6 pm Tuesday & Thursday\n\nFee: $61 | Includes spay/neuter, shots, microchip, license, 30 days free pet insurance (when registered upon adoption)\n\nThe CITY DOGS mission is to increase adoptions from the City Kennel by changing the image of the pit bulls who make up the majority of the kennel population, by preparing all adoptable dogs in the kennel for lives in loving homes and by creating as many opportunities as possible for the public to meet and get to know our dogs for the terrific pets they are meant to be.\n\nOur Adoption Process...\nHere's a little about how things work:\nAll of the CITY DOGS posted for adoption are available for direct adoption from the kennel, unless noted otherwise. You must schedule a meet with a dog in advance - we are not currently accepting walk-ins. Please look online first to see if there are any dogs you think would be a good fit for your home before scheduling a meet. To get the process started, visit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog and fill out the form. One of our adoption counselors will get in touch to schedule and confirm your meet! At the kennel, an adoption counselor will introduce you and your family to the adoptable dogs, share information we know about them, and discuss our suggested ways for successfully integrating a new dog into your home. You are welcome to meet multiple dogs. If the dog you adopt is already fixed, he or she may leave with you that day - otherwise, the dog can go home after receiving the spay or neuter surgery.)\n\nAbout Our Dogs: All available dogs have gone through a behavioral and medical assessment. This assessment is a snapshot of who the dog is at that given time. We cannot make any guarantees with regard to behavior, temperament or health of any City Dog once they are in the home. Most of our dogs are picked up as strays, so we do not know what kind of home environment they were living in (i.e. with kids, other dogs or other cats), nor do we know if most of them are house trained. Everything we know about them is based on volunteer and staff observations. We do have some dogs in foster homes, where they will have more information about how the dog is in a home environment. It is very hard to tell with certainty whether or not a dog will be good with kids, cats or another dog. If you have kids in the home or another dog, we do require that they be present for a meet and greet with the dog you are considering for adoption.\n\nHeath/Vaccinations: Dogs that are adopted directly from the kennel need to go to your personal vet within two weeks of leaving the kennel. All dogs receive their DAPPL, Rabies, and Bordatella vaccines, though you may be required to get follow up boosters. All dogs come microchipped and with a Cuyahoga County license.?  \n\n\n\n \n",

Although he is getting love, the small townhouse with no yard just doesn't seem big enough for him.  Bruno needs a strong, confident, patient, loving, fun owner.  \n\nA little more about Bruno:\nHe LOVES to play and he has a lot of energy!   \nWhen done playing, he will cuddle next to you.\nHe's a great sleeper!  He sleeps through the night.  He will sleep in a crate, but has also been allowed on the bed.  He isn't a crowder.  He does like to sleep in, so don't count on him getting you up for work.  \nHe has great manners!  He sits for treats and takes them so gently.  He sits for his leash to be put on.  He seeks permission to get on the couch and obeys quickly when told it is time to get off.  He \"settles\" in his bed when the humans are eating.  He's a gentleman and lets the humans go downstairs first (no tripping).  He often waits going upstairs too, but sometimes he will run ahead.\nHe is housetrained.\nHe is sweet!  He gives the appropriate amount of kisses -- you feel loved but aren't left a slobbery mess.\nHe loves car rides.\nHe's smart!  Picks up on new commands quickly.  Loves to work puzzles and kongs. \nHe is working on walking on a leash. \nWe are not sure how he is with kids or cats.",

To adopt, complete our online adoption application and an Adoption Counselor will contact you within 48-hours to schedule your adoption appointment. Adoptions for any pets in foster will be completed offsite at our PetSmart Claiborne location on a case by case basis. The safety of our foster parents and community is of utmost importance to us and it will be at the foster's discretion if they'd like to meet at this time. Thank you for choosing adoption! \n\nJanna is a sweet happy wiggle butt senior lady dog who finds herself in need of a new living situation.  She is a ;people oriented dog who loves just hanging with humans.  She walks nicely on leash and loves to meet new people. She just needs a chance to show you what a wonderful caompanion she can be.\n\nTo inquire about an adoptable animal from the Louisiana SPCA, please call 504.368.5191, ext. 150 to speak with an adoption counselor.\nTo see more adoptable animals from the Louisiana SPCA, please go to http://la-spca.org/adopt.\n\n\n\nThe petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n",

            "description": "Dash is a very sweet boy who just wants to love! He found himself at the shelter because of his previous owner's living situation. He's silly and a bit of an attention hog, but only because he adores affection. His previous owner shared he can be protective when strangers enter the house and doesn't do well when he is around other large dogs. So we are unsure if he is no dogs or dog selective and prefers dogs smaller than him, so a dog meet is a must. He doesn't react to smaller/medium dogs when they walk by him in the shelter, but definitely reacts to larger dogs walking by him. Because of his size and energy we are recommending a home with no young children. A home with teenagers may be fine, so bring them along to the meet. He seems extremely well trained. He really doesn't pull on the lead, knows all basic commands, etc. He loves affection, especially butt scratches. He would do best in a home with a fenced yard or someone who runs, jogs or is active. If you think Dash is a great fit for your family, click on the link to fill out an online application and give the shelter a call to schedule a meet.",

            "description": "Why, hello there, thanks so much for noticing me! I am a very sweet and friendly retriever mix named Nebula who is ready for a new home. I am a natural explorer and would love to find a best friend to go on adventures with. If you like hiking, taking day trips, camping, being out in the wilderness; I am the lady for you. I'm already leash trained and I'm told I walk very well on my leash, too. At home, I would love a basket full of toys and some delicious treats would make my heart soar. They are probably my favorite thing, ever! I also love hanging out with other pups, so please let my HALO friends know if you will be bringing your current dogs with you, when you call to schedule to meet me. I look forward to hanging out with you and seeing if we're the pawfect fit.",

I look like I\u2019m always wearin a tuxedo and the ladies call me a heartbreaker. In the beginning I may not be sure or trust everyone so you have to let me know your trusting and loving  when we first meet. But I am extremely loyal and sweet as you can see from my photos.\n\nI  want affection, love and security from my new family. But it will also be important to have an owner who will help me work through proper training since I didnt get it as a young boy like listening to commands and leash walking properly even when I see other animals. I will require a patient and kind person who is willing to love me as I transform. Once you start training me I am eager to please. Im food and affection motivated which will make it easy on you. \n\nWhen we go on walks, In the beginning I pull but I\u2019m learning to slow down with my excitement after a bit.  Riding in Cars make me nervous but I am getting better with that while working with the rescue team. I just dont know what I haven\u2019t learned yet but I\u2019m super smart and pick up on things fast. I don\u2019t like when people just come up to me without proper greeting or go to fast it makes me nervous but the more socialized I get the better I will be at that. I am looking to have a loving, safe and happy life with you as you show me the ropes of the world. \n\nFor now since I wasn\u2019t socialized a lot with other furkids I don\u2019t know how to be around other animals so at the moment I just need to be an only child that way you can focus on my training and we don\u2019t have to share snuggles. With some structure and training I should be able to overcome any hurdle. I would love a beautiful fenced in yard and a bed inside to cuddle with you on.\n\nI promise I\u2019ll be the best decision you made in your life if you pick me!\n",

Thankfully he was chipped but the family worked long hours and did not have time for him.  They also lived in an apartment.  \n\nOnce he got to the rescue he was super sweet and lovable.  He came right up to us and loved on us.  He likes to lay on the couch next to you.  He is a beautiful, creamy chocolate color. He loves everyone he sees and other dogs too.  He is gentle with his puppy friends, just a bit awkward with his size.  \n\nCome meet this beautiful boy as he is more handsome in person.",

            "description": "Hunter is a 9mo old hound mix who currently weighs about 50lbs. Hunter was given up by his family because they could no longer afford to keep him. Up until now, Hunter had led a secluded life. He is very affectionate and loves to play, but needs some basic obedience training and more socialization. For example, going on walks he's afraid of the people and things he encounters. UPDATE: Hunter's confidence on walks is growing; he's curious now and no longer fearful. He has also never been around dogs, and is having a hard time adjusting to living with the other dogs in his foster home. He is afraid of them which causes him to act defensively. He is good around cats and babies, we have been told. The best home for Hunter would be one that is experienced in training dogs and will be patient as he adjusts. The $250 adoption fee includes spay/neuter surgery, current shots, deworming and flea preventative, and microchip. Please contact luckyonesrescue@hotmail.com for more information and adoption application and to arrange a meeting.",

            "description": "Adoption Fee: $300\nAdoption Application: www.wherethewildthingsarerescue.com\n\nHi everyone! My name is Lianna. I am a Cane Corso pup approximately 8 months old. Would you like to know my story? It doesn\u2019t start out great like most rescues, but thankfully I know the best life is on its way. You see I am officially a part of WTWTA Rescue and they take loving rescue kids like me and my sisters pretty seriously.  \n\nSo, my journey began when my sisters and I were found along a country road dumped off by our previous owners. I know what your thinking, how could somebody abandon beautiful kids like us\u2026sadly this happens more often then it should. My sisters and I decided to stick together while we were off fending for ourselves near the woods. cause that\u2019s what sisters do  We were better as a pack than separated from one another. Thankfully a Good Samaritan who knows mastiffs saw us and picked us up. They were diligent about where we would be placed and who they would allow to rescue us so we could be kept safe and we are grateful for that. \n\nYou see being an italian mastiff breed, we are a pretty \u201cBIG\u201d deal!\u2026.see what I did there :P So they contacted WTWTA who knows kids like us well and are specialized in placing our breeds in the right home. Since being a part of WTWTA we are learning what it feels like to be loved again. They took us to get vaccinated. At first i was a little nervous going to the vet\u2019s, but I quickly overcame that and did well in their care. I received all the necessary vaccinations and tests. Sadly, I suffer from a slight heart murmur and something called cherry eye which is to be fixed with surgery covered by the rescue.\n\nI really enjoyed the car ride and the lady who transported me had a big Subaru decked out especially for dogs. There was this huge bed for me in the back to sleep on. I had the whole back bed to myself. It was peaceful and soooooo comfortable I melted like ice cream on a summer day, and while on the way we listened to so many different songs while I slept snuggled in a soft blanket.\n\nAfter the vet visit, we had a spa day\u2026.CAN YOU BELIEVE A SPA DAY!!! I should tell you, during spa day when I had a tubby (bath) I did great, but I was a little scared. However, afterwards, I felt like a million bucks!. They kept commenting on how shiny my coat was. I was shining bright like a black diamond and it felt amazing! I\u2019m sweeter than maple syrup but got some spunk to me too. Throughout this process I learned my favorite thing is when i\u2019m wrapped in human arms and getting love and belly rubs. Now, theres nothing I  want more then to have a person and a family who loves me. Also, Im down if you're up for giving me some self-care (ie. blueberry facials, coconut oil rubs and turkey jerky) I am an Italian gal :) \n\nAt the moment, I am still working on potty training and leash training, so you will have to be patient. I am still coming into who I am, and it may take me a while to completely open up and adjust. I am unsure about other dogs and would need some time and ask my new owners to go slow with me as I learn how to feel safe in the world again. If you currently have another dog, we would need to meet first to ensure we like each other and its a good fit. Right now I am not sure about small animals so no cats or smalls breeds in the home. I would prefer a nice fenced in yard to play in since I am a giant breed and room to run would be perfect! If your wanting a pup with unconditional love then you came to the right place  :)\n",

If not, it's okay, I can use my leash or probably your socks.\n\nMy friends would describe me as an exuberant teenager looking for a constructive outlet. Hey, we've all been there! Personally, I think I'm a little too cool for the shelter lifestyle- I prefer to run and play away the days. I wouldn't mind a canine sibling who's up for some rowdy wrestling matches. And did I mention toys? If you have some cool toys, ask an adoption counselor about me today! Primary Color: Black Secondary Color: Tan Weight: 54.6lbs Age: 1yrs 0mths 2wks Animal has been Neutered",

            "description": "Mikey is a male, 12lb chi mix who is around 5-6 years old. He came to us as a stray (stray hold has been completed) with a hurt leg and very scared demeanor. It is obvious that Mikey did not see a lot of love and care prior to coming into our rescue, as he has been scared of quick movements and was never housebroken or leash trained. Though he was very scared upon intake, Mikey has made huge strides with his foster family. Mikey seems to be open to affection and has made progress in leash walking and housebreaking (though it still isn't perfect, the belly band is really helping him learn). Someone who adopts Mikey will have to be patient with him and commit to his continued training and housebreaking, also building trust. Mikey has started his vaccinations, is scheduled to be neutered and microchipped, heartworm and lyme disease tested. So far, Mikey is doing great in his foster home with the other dogs and cats. Mikey does not like when other dogs get in his face, so a calmer canine sibling would be ideal. Due to his fears, we would only recommend children over the age of 12 years old, who understand to give him the space that he needs. \nMikey's adoption fee is $250 which includes his neuter, microchipping, vaccinations and heartworm/lyme testing. If you want to meet Mikey with hopes to make him part of your family, be sure to FIRST apply on our website for approval: https://www.theroadhomeanimalproject.org/companion-adoption-form-pdf.html\n\n*Note: ALL members of the family (canine and human alike) MUST be present for any meet and greet.\n\nPlease remember that we are a board of entirely volunteers that have full time jobs as well as our rescue passion. So, be patient with us and check out our Facebook page for more information and photo updates: facebook.com/trhap2014",

            "description": "Lorna is a one year old, Cattle Dog/Great Pyrenees mix with personality traits of both, so experience required. She weighs about 48 pounds. She is ok with other dogs and cats. Kids should be 10+. She knows basic commands, is housebroken, crate trained, and good on leash. She has some resource guarding issues, so she will need someone willing to continue working with her on that. She is highly intelligent and medium energy. She is a very sweet, affectionate girl but will push boundaries. If you are interested in learning more about Lorna, please complete an application and then reach out to Corey@bigfluffydogs.com\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please apply online, at https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/. \n\nOur main website, www.bigfluffydogs.com has more information about us and the rescue process. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters should understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. Homes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for 1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (i.e. a 4-month-old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break). 2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise. 3.) Socialization.  The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home. 4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded ten-fold, for years to come.  Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy.  Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time-consuming and can be expensive. All dogs require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well-socialized dog is more than worth the effort to get them there.",

Thank you for your patience! We are working to find everyone a companion. \n\nRainy is an adorable 9 week old boxer/lab mix. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting the first step is to fill out an adoption application on our website aaanimalrescue.org. We are currently very busy! Please reach out to allaboardanimalrescue@gmail.com if you have an approved application on file! Please fill out an adoption application on our website if you are ready to adopt! \n\nThank you for your patience and understanding during this difficult time! We are on a mission to find everyone companions, we will continue to rescue dogs weekly! We update our page every Monday evening. We are not currently hosting any Petco adoption events for the public. We will be hosting meet/greet adoption appointments!\n\n\nBreed and size disclosure: As a rescue all of our dogs come to us from high-kill shelters or other rescues, so we do not get a lot of background or information on these dogs. We occasionally receive the mother with the puppies, but in most cases both parents are unknown. Because of this we do not know the full breeding of the dogs. We are required to list the dogs based on the breeds provided to us on their records, but they are all mixed breeds as far as we know, and we cannot guarantee the actual breeds of any of these dogs. Since the full breeding of the dogs is unknown we can also only give you an educated guess on the full-grown size of the dogs. All of the current information we have on the dogs is listed in their bio above. More information may be available at our adoption event, since a lot of the fosters turn in report cards on how the dog has done in their care when they drop them off. \n\nAdoption Process: If you are interested in adopting from us, the first step of our adoption process is to fill out an application online at http://aaanimalrescue.org/adoption_app.html. It takes us 24-48 hours to process your application and get back to you, via email. Applications turned in Friday afternoon or Saturday morning will not be processed since we are preparing for or at our adoption event. We do have applications on site at our events, but are not always able to approve them at that time and many of the dogs will already have holds on them, so we suggest you fill out an application prior to attending an adoption event. We can place a hold on one dog per approved applicant after a deposit fee has been received, please do not ask to hold a dog if you have not turned in an application and been approved, for the first hour of our adoption event, so that they can get the first chance to meet and hopefully adopt that dog. After the first hour of the event all dogs are available on a first come, first serve basis. If you already have an approved application on file, there will just be more paperwork and the adoption fee at the event, but you will be able to take home the dog/puppy that day. Since we are foster based and do not have a location, our dogs are only available to meet at our events, unless otherwise noted.",

Thank you for your patience! We are working to find everyone a companion. \n\nConnor is a loving 12 week old lab/Shepherd mix. \n\n\nFrom the foster: They are both well behaved and sleep through the night. They were only with me for a weekend so I am not sure how engrained the lessons are but they learned how to fetch, sit, and to pee/poop outside.\n\nThey are both pretty active but love cuddles above all.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting the first step is to fill out an adoption application on our website aaanimalrescue.org. We are currently very busy! Please reach out to allaboardanimalrescue@gmail.com if you have an approved application on file! Please fill out an adoption application on our website if you are ready to adopt! \n\nThank you for your patience and understanding during this difficult time! We are on a mission to find everyone companions, we will continue to rescue dogs weekly! We update our page every Monday evening. We are not currently hosting any Petco adoption events for the public. We will be hosting meet/greet adoption appointments!\n\n\nBreed and size disclosure: As a rescue all of our dogs come to us from high-kill shelters or other rescues, so we do not get a lot of background or information on these dogs. We occasionally receive the mother with the puppies, but in most cases both parents are unknown. Because of this we do not know the full breeding of the dogs. We are required to list the dogs based on the breeds provided to us on their records, but they are all mixed breeds as far as we know, and we cannot guarantee the actual breeds of any of these dogs. Since the full breeding of the dogs is unknown we can also only give you an educated guess on the full-grown size of the dogs. All of the current information we have on the dogs is listed in their bio above. More information may be available at our adoption event, since a lot of the fosters turn in report cards on how the dog has done in their care when they drop them off. \n\nAdoption Process: If you are interested in adopting from us, the first step of our adoption process is to fill out an application online at http://aaanimalrescue.org/adoption_app.html. It takes us 24-48 hours to process your application and get back to you, via email. Applications turned in Friday afternoon or Saturday morning will not be processed since we are preparing for or at our adoption event. We do have applications on site at our events, but are not always able to approve them at that time and many of the dogs will already have holds on them, so we suggest you fill out an application prior to attending an adoption event. We can place a hold on one dog per approved applicant after a deposit fee has been received, please do not ask to hold a dog if you have not turned in an application and been approved, for the first hour of our adoption event, so that they can get the first chance to meet and hopefully adopt that dog. After the first hour of the event all dogs are available on a first come, first serve basis. If you already have an approved application on file, there will just be more paperwork and the adoption fee at the event, but you will be able to take home the dog/puppy that day. Since we are foster based and do not have a location, our dogs are only available to meet at our events, unless otherwise noted.",

Thank you for your patience! We are working to find everyone a companion. \n\nScrappy is an adorable 2 year old terrier mix. \n\nScrappy! \nTemp Test:https://youtu.be/qyOzKVoshCI\nTemp test:https://youtu.be/pZ8WEB5lnv4\n\nIf you are interested in adopting the first step is to fill out an adoption application on our website aaanimalrescue.org. We are currently very busy! Please reach out to allaboardanimalrescue@gmail.com if you have an approved application on file! Please fill out an adoption application on our website if you are ready to adopt! \n\nThank you for your patience and understanding during this difficult time! We are on a mission to find everyone companions, we will continue to rescue dogs weekly! We update our page every Monday evening. We are not currently hosting any Petco adoption events for the public. We will be hosting meet/greet adoption appointments!\n\n\nBreed and size disclosure: As a rescue all of our dogs come to us from high-kill shelters or other rescues, so we do not get a lot of background or information on these dogs. We occasionally receive the mother with the puppies, but in most cases both parents are unknown. Because of this we do not know the full breeding of the dogs. We are required to list the dogs based on the breeds provided to us on their records, but they are all mixed breeds as far as we know, and we cannot guarantee the actual breeds of any of these dogs. Since the full breeding of the dogs is unknown we can also only give you an educated guess on the full-grown size of the dogs. All of the current information we have on the dogs is listed in their bio above. More information may be available at our adoption event, since a lot of the fosters turn in report cards on how the dog has done in their care when they drop them off. \n\nAdoption Process: If you are interested in adopting from us, the first step of our adoption process is to fill out an application online at http://aaanimalrescue.org/adoption_app.html. It takes us 24-48 hours to process your application and get back to you, via email. Applications turned in Friday afternoon or Saturday morning will not be processed since we are preparing for or at our adoption event. We do have applications on site at our events, but are not always able to approve them at that time and many of the dogs will already have holds on them, so we suggest you fill out an application prior to attending an adoption event. We can place a hold on one dog per approved applicant after a deposit fee has been received, please do not ask to hold a dog if you have not turned in an application and been approved, for the first hour of our adoption event, so that they can get the first chance to meet and hopefully adopt that dog. After the first hour of the event all dogs are available on a first come, first serve basis. If you already have an approved application on file, there will just be more paperwork and the adoption fee at the event, but you will be able to take home the dog/puppy that day. Since we are foster based and do not have a location, our dogs are only available to meet at our events, unless otherwise noted.",

Thank you for your patience! We are working to find everyone a companion. \n\nHank is an adorable 2 year old Staffordshire terrier/cattle dog mix. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting the first step is to fill out an adoption application on our website aaanimalrescue.org. We are currently very busy! Please reach out to allaboardanimalrescue@gmail.com if you have an approved application on file! Please fill out an adoption application on our website if you are ready to adopt! \n\nThank you for your patience and understanding during this difficult time! We are on a mission to find everyone companions, we will continue to rescue dogs weekly! We update our page every Monday evening. We are not currently hosting any Petco adoption events for the public. We will be hosting meet/greet adoption appointments!\n\n\nBreed and size disclosure: As a rescue all of our dogs come to us from high-kill shelters or other rescues, so we do not get a lot of background or information on these dogs. We occasionally receive the mother with the puppies, but in most cases both parents are unknown. Because of this we do not know the full breeding of the dogs. We are required to list the dogs based on the breeds provided to us on their records, but they are all mixed breeds as far as we know, and we cannot guarantee the actual breeds of any of these dogs. Since the full breeding of the dogs is unknown we can also only give you an educated guess on the full-grown size of the dogs. All of the current information we have on the dogs is listed in their bio above. More information may be available at our adoption event, since a lot of the fosters turn in report cards on how the dog has done in their care when they drop them off. \n\nAdoption Process: If you are interested in adopting from us, the first step of our adoption process is to fill out an application online at http://aaanimalrescue.org/adoption_app.html. It takes us 24-48 hours to process your application and get back to you, via email. Applications turned in Friday afternoon or Saturday morning will not be processed since we are preparing for or at our adoption event. We do have applications on site at our events, but are not always able to approve them at that time and many of the dogs will already have holds on them, so we suggest you fill out an application prior to attending an adoption event. We can place a hold on one dog per approved applicant after a deposit fee has been received, please do not ask to hold a dog if you have not turned in an application and been approved, for the first hour of our adoption event, so that they can get the first chance to meet and hopefully adopt that dog. After the first hour of the event all dogs are available on a first come, first serve basis. If you already have an approved application on file, there will just be more paperwork and the adoption fee at the event, but you will be able to take home the dog/puppy that day. Since we are foster based and do not have a location, our dogs are only available to meet at our events, unless otherwise noted.",

            "description": "Starla is a five-year-old, 33-pound Australian Cattle Dog mix. She was picked up as a stray by a county field officer. Starla was nervous of the officer and they used a snare to contain her. After an initial freak-out, Starla allowed herself to be picked up and carried to the county van. County noted that Starla never attempted to bite any humans; she just stiffened or tried to run. Starla has been slowly gaining her confidence at Home Fur Good. With consistency, routine, and seeing the same employees and volunteers, Starla is expecting certain activities and she is building her trust. She is very alert and watchful; if you talk softly, move slowly, and offer a gentle hand, Starla will seek affection. A few ear scratches and she will be crawling into your lap. County did introduce Starla to a doggie playgroup, but she was fearful around the other dogs. She is working on being brave, and she recently joined the Dog Walking Group. She caught on quickly and relaxed enough to go on a trot and even gave her tail a wag! Although shy, Starla\u2019s curiosity will get the best of her. She will slink her way up to all new people; she is testing it out to see if she can score some loving pets or treats.  Starla will show off her sit and paw skills for a few treats; if you ask her to sit, she does, and immediately hands the paw. She is a sweet girl, a bit cross eyed, but 100% adorable.  Starla would do best in a home of experienced dog owners, ones who understand a fearful dog and are willing to work with Starla and help her to come out of her shell.  She would do best in a home with older children and with low visitor traffic.  Her forever home needs to be able to take new experiences slow.  Starla will need time to decompress in her new home; she will want to understand the rules and routines before being exposed to new scenarios.  An owner with experience in cattle dogs would be very beneficial for Starla.  She is a herding dog and she may try to keep her pack in line. The adoption fee is $225 and includes spaying/neutering, age-appropriate vaccinations, microchipping, and a free wellness visit at Phoenix Mountain Animal Hospital. Our adoption hours are Thursday-Saturday from 11:00 am-4:00 pm by appointment only.",

It doesn't take much to make me happy! I'm pretty quiet, but I can bark now and again. Because I am a senior, I do have some special needs. I'm blind and deaf. I have eye drops for my eyes because I have dry eye and will need to have them every day. I also take a medication for my arthritis and occasional seizures. My foster mom just puts the pill in my food, and I gobble it right up! I will potty outside, but you need to pick me up and carry me outside. I've noticed my foster mom uses that time to sneak in extra hugs and kisses. Even though I am a senior and have a few health issues, I would love the best life possible in my golden years! I am current on all my shots, neutered, microchipped, and heartworm negative. Won't you please consider giving this old guy a chance? XXOO",

            "description": "Cooper is a southern dog who came to Best Bullies after a 15 month stint in a shelter in Georgia.  He is around 4 years old and truly is a southern gent with all the charm that comes with that.  Hi is very affectionate, loves to give kisses and meet new people.  He has gotten along with other dogs but if you have a pet we need to introduce them just to be sure.  He is currently in a foster home and he is just a snuggle bunny.  He loves to eat but is more than willing to share.  Cooper is not use to the cold but he loves his house shirt and his coat.  He even puts booties on so he can frolic in his first taste of snow! \nIf you are interested in this love bug, go to bestbullies.org and fill out an application and send it to bestbulliesny@aol.com Cooper is just waiting to love you!!",

My name is Sasha. I am an approximately 8 months old Cane Corso. Would you like to know my story? It doesn\u2019t start out great, but I already know I\u2019m going to have the best life. You see I am officially a part of WTWTA Rescue. They take loving us kids pretty seriously.  \n\nSo, my journey began when my sisters and I were found along a road. Can you believe we were dumped!! We were fending for ourselves for a while. No matter the circumstances though, my sisters and I decided to stick together.  We were better as a pack than separated from one another. While we were traveling along the road, a Good Samaritan picked us up. They were diligent about where we would be placed and who they would allow rescue us. We are grateful for that. You see we are a pretty BIG deal\u2026.see what I did there :P? Well, after their research they contacted WTWTA. Since being a part of WTWTA we are learning what it feels like to be loved. They took us to get vaccinated. I was nervous at the vet\u2019s, but I am strong and know I can overcome anything, and I did. I received shots and had test run to make sure I was healthy. I passed with flying colors.  \n\nNow, I don\u2019t know what everything means. But my driver\u2026.yes that\u2019s right! I had a drive because an italian beauty like me should be chauffeured! Let me tell you my driver on my first car trip kept talking and talking. I understood most of the conversation but there was one word i didn\u2019t know\u2026I did not know about this cow-ouch thing... I mean he was telling me how much fun I was going to have when I learned what a cow-ouch and a warm bed was, I dunno I guess ill have to take his word for it\u2026 It was a little stressful but he kept telling me how safe I was and how I was a sweet and good pup\u2026. I wasn\u2019t about to argue that comment. What pup would? I know eventually my sisters and I will be separated into loving homes. I was always the protector of my sisters but my rescuer said I didn\u2019t need to be the guardian anymore. Now WTWTA would keep us safe and guard us. I whimpered because I hadn\u2019t known what that felt like in my whole life...  \n\nNow, since being here they have seen some of my personality and traits. I must admit I need a little work,  but with proper training and Love I know I can learn quick and overcome these. I first need to learn to be walked on a leash\u2026..I typically try to walk/drag the hoomans. I cower if you move too quickly or yell, so you will need to be gentle yet confident and firm for me to trust you and feel safe to learn. I do fine with bath time and will sit for my supper if you ask me. At the moment, I have not had a full temperament test done but for now it will be best if I am the only pet in the house until I am further safely socialized. Because of my size and strength I must have a fenced in yard so I can stretch out and run. I\u2019m not done growing so once I am done\u2026.I will need room and exercise. I am a guardian breed by nature and although WTWTA say I don\u2019t need to be that anymore\u2026it will come out so I prefer to be with an experienced dog parent that will give me the security I need to know when I need to step in and when I don\u2019t. I am still working on my potty training and that will take some time as I have been kept outside or in a kennel facility so please be patient with me. \n\nI have been fully vetted and vaccinated and microchipped and passed with flying colors! Now its my time to be with a beautiful family and get the love I've long deserved\u2026\n\nO and my sisters and I agree, now that we are moving up in life we would like weekly blueberry facials rubs and coconut oil spa days :)\n\nIf you are interested in Sasha, please list her name on the adoption application.",

He is smart, eager, quick to learn, and loves to please. He has a lot of energy so he would do best in a home with an active lifestyle. Ivory is a strong, compact, muscular and dominant dog that would do best with a person who will be firm, patient, and also provide ongoing training.\n\nIvory is quick to adapt to new environments and routines. He will go into his crate but requires patience and treats to motivate him. He will protest the first few minutes but is quick to settle himself and relax. I'm currently not crating him and have left him out with my resident dog for 8+ hours a day and have had no issues. He gets along well with other dogs and plays nonstop with my pitbull mix. Although I think he would do fine in a home where he's the only dog, it may be best for him to have a companion to help him gain confidence and teach him how to be a dog.\n\nIvory is still young and a work in progress. If given the proper training and chance he will make a wonderful companion and loyal sidekick.",

For more photos of Panda, follow us on Facebook Gateway Pet Guardians and Instagram @gatewaypets ... #gpgPanda. \n\nTo view other adoptable pets from our shelter, please visit, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nGateway Pet Guardians is proud to offer a variety of mixed breed dogs available for adoption. However, please keep in mind that we rarely know the genetic background of the animals we rescue and, as such, we cannot guarantee the exact breed combinations found within this dog. However, we do not know his/her actual genetic makeup. Just know that this dog is probably a variety of several different breeds that have combined to create one very amazing and unique animal.",

Because of this she can not go to a home that has other animals. Maggie Mae is smart and attentive. She listens to commands and she LOVES to lay in the pool.

He lived a pretty sheltered life prior to coming to ODAAT but has been doing great at becoming more social. His way of kissing you is to nose bump you! He loves to play along the fences with the other dogs at the kennel. His Momma, Marcy, also came in with him and he loves playing with her but she bosses him around (like Moms do :)) Duali has made such progress with us and with a family that doesnt mind showing him that the world isnt so scary, we believe he will continue to get better and be an even more wonderful dog! Duali will need another dog companion similar in size in the home as he loves to play and enjoys the company of dogs. If you would like for Duali to join your family please apply through our website\nwww.onedogatatime.us",

Stuffed toys are his favorite, and he'll carry them around and shake them up! He also loves being around people and wants to make as many new friends as possible! When it comes to new canine friends, he can be a bit nervous when first meeting them, so it would be best if he could meet any dogs in the house before going to his forever home. Juri gets very excited when seeing feline friends, so a home without cats would be best. Do you want to be the one to give Juri a family? Talk to an adoptions representative today to meet him and give him the loving home he deserves!

IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN FOSTERING OR ADOPTING BENJI, PLEASE GO TO THE MAKE A DIFFERENCE RESCUE PAGE AND SEND A PRIVATE MESSAGE THAT INCLUDES YOUR PHONE NUMBER AND EMAIL ADDRESS.\n\nBenji is a very handsome 2.5 year old Terrier mix. Benji and his brother Carter were living on the streets of Detroit. We were contacted to save them and now they are enjoying a warm place to live, good food and lots of loving. He can be a little skittish when meets new people, but quickly warms up to them. Benji is a fun and loving guy. He loves peanut butter, Nylabones and stuffed toys!! He is working on learning basic commands and is treat motivated. Children 10 years old or older. Benji is good with other dogs after a slow introduction is done. Unfortunately, we do not know how Benji is with cats. His forever home must have a totally enclosed physically fenced yard where he can safely run, play and hang out with his people. Benji is neutered, up to date on his vaccinations, on heart worm preventative as well as house and crate trained. Benji cannot wait to be a part of a loving and fun family!!\n\nAll dogs we rescue stay with us until they find their forever homes. We do not do same day adoptions. A home visit is required to ensure our dog is going to a safe environment and our dog gets along with your dog(s) and/or cat(s). We require all our dogs over the age of 1 year attend 1 obedience class (6 week session) outside the home. You must live within 1 hour of Birmingham, MI to adopt one of our dogs. No out of state or outside the U.S. adoptions or fosters. Benji''s adoption fee is $275.",

Submit an application from our website and then make an appointment to meet her.\n\nAnnie is not eligible for foster and will be a straight adoption.\n\nAge: ~1 year\nWeight: ~37lbs\nHousebroken: Working on it! She needs to be on a strict schedule. She may also submissive pee out of fear/anxiety.\nCrate trained: Working on it! She takes time to settle (10-30 minutes) and would benefit from continued training for this. \nDog sociability: She has lived with dogs, but is protective over resources (food, space, her person) so would do best as a solo dog in her home. She is friendly while meeting dogs on her walks and has done well in playgroup. She may be a good candidate for daycare as she does enjoy the company of other dogs outside her home.\nCat sociability: Unknown\nKids: Not a match - she resource guards and will do best with adults that understand this behavior\nIdeal home: Annie is a sweet gal looking for a home that can help her be her best self! She takes time to settle in new spaces and shows some generalized anxiety. She will do best in adult-only home that is comfortable to read dog body language well and can give her space when needed. \n\nLittle Foster Annie is ready for the sun to come out over her new home! At around one year old, Annie is bursting with energy and loves being active. She becomes instant best friends with every dog she meets and will gladly accept any playdate offered to her! She is still navigating the task of being housebroken, but with a strict schedule, she knows outside is her potty. She loves following you around the home and is happy to snuggle up next to you on the couch for your favorite show at night. She is looking for a patient home that has experience with dogs and dog body language. She doesn't love to be woken up from naps (same, Annie, same!) and she doesn't love her food/bones to be taken away. Respect her boundaries, and her heart will be yours!\n\nAnnie's adoption fee is 300. She is up to date on core vaccines, microchipped, spayed and heartworm negative.\n\n***We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications. We ask that you please be patient and someone will be in touch via email within 72 hours. Please do not email us unless you have not received a response in 72 hours. Please only fill out one adoption application. ***",

Leelo was housebroken in her former home, did well with young children and was described by her most recent caretaker as very sweet and playful. When meeting other dogs in PACC playgroup, Leelo was nervous but tolerant of the other dogs greetings. She corrected the other dogs appropriately when she needed space, and mostly kept to herself. She should meet any resident dogs before going home to make sure its good fit- what if one is a Days of our Lives fan, but the other thinks General Hospital is where its at?? Ask to meet Leelo today- this sweetie is struggling in the shelter environment and could really use a quick ticket out to a loving home!",

Need a home with structure and committed training from the whole family Dog-Dog: Due to high arousal and rude face to face greeting, this dog may due best as the only dog, as well as not a candidate for off-leash dog parks.",

            "description": "Wynona Jane is a spayed female 1.5 year old 30lb mixed breed girl - we think she looks like an Australian Shepherd/Spaniel mix. Her name really fits her, since she is small, sweet & full of spunk & energy!! She does know some basic commands, but needs lots of work on her manners. We are currently working on retraining jumping up on people and her mouthiness. Her personality is 100% Aussie/herding dog. She has no off switch and TONS of energy. She loves other dogs and older children, but they must be able to put up with her puppy antics, constant drive for playtime, and high energy level. A home with younger children is not a good fit, since she is fearful of them and doesn't know how to contain her energy yet. Wynona would do best in an active home, preferably with another dog who wants to play with her all the time. She is very timid around new men, but seems to be perfectly fine when meeting new women. We think she could happily live in a home with a man, but they would need to be understanding and respectful of her boundaries. With enough time and positive experiences with men, she should be able to adapt well. Her high food and toy drive make her very easy to train for a dedicated adoptive home! A securely fenced yard is required for Wynona's adoptive home. If you're interested in meeting or adopting Wynona, the first step would be filling out an adoption application via our website scsheltierescue.com. Her adoption donation of $250 includes all vaccinations, spay & microchip. FEBRUARY 2021",

He is your typical Bluetick Coonhound, if you are familiar with the breed.  He has no food or resource guarding and is happy-go-lucky! His adoption fee is only $120.00.  Dog adoption fees include a microchip.\n\nThe adoption fee includes the animal's surgery, vaccinations, flea preventative, deworming medication, sample bag of food/treat samples and a free first exam with participating veterinarians. Shelter policy and 2018 Indiana state law decrees all animals must be spayed or neutered prior to leaving the shelter.\n\nOur shelter is open to the public on Monday- Saturday from 8:00 am -5:00 pm EST with the exception of Wednesdays on which we typically open by 1:00 pm. If you would like to make an appointment to meet one of our many adoptable animals, please send an email to us at pvchs@joink.com. To apply to adopt, you may download an adoption application from the Applications and Fees tab on our website. The web address is www.pvchs.org.

Please read our \u201cINTERESTED IN ADOPTING?\u201d section below for guidance. ~\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014------------------\n\nJudy\u2019s a male (yes, male!) Samoyed/Spitz mix is 2 years old and weighs 35 pounds. He was rescued from a dog meat farm along with with his brother Hobbes (from our Wednesday post) and sister Bonnie (who we\u2019ll post soon). He loves going on long walks, has a healthy appetite, and has shown a lot of healthy interest in other dogs. He\u2019s getting more comfortable with toys, and while he loves to carry them around his foster home, he hasn\u2019t yet mastered the art of actually *playing* with them. This smart and adaptive cutie will take some time to open up, but we know that your patience will be rewarded. He\u2019s quick to take in his surroundings, but can get a bit overwhelmed by all of the noises and movements of the big city (we can relate!). If you are a patient adopter in an adults-only home who is ready to help Judy see all of the beauty in his surroundings and grow his independence, we\u2019d love to hear from you!\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014------------------\n\nOur adoption radius is now within 30 miles of the following locations:  NYC, Philadelphia, Lehigh Valley, DC, Baltimore, MD, and Western & Eastern CT. You must be able to pick up the dog at our office in Astoria, Queens (no exceptions). You must wear a mask and practice safe social distancing when traveling and picking up the dog.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014------------------\n\nINTERESTED IN ADOPTING?\n\nPlease check our Adopt page (www.koreank9rescue.org/adopt) and our Adoption FAQ (www.koreank9rescue.org/adoption-faq) to learn more! These pages include our requirements, adoption fees, adoption procedures, currently adoptable dogs, answers to frequently asked questions, and the link to our online adoption application!\n\n\nNOT READY TO ADOPT BUT LOVE OUR DOGS?\n\n\nAs a 501(c)(3) dog rescue, we rely on donations to continue saving these precious dogs. Check our Donate page (www.koreank9rescue.org/donate) and our Patreon (www.patreon.com/koreank9rescue) to help support our rescue. Let's keep making a difference together!",

Trike cannot wait to learn manners, leash skills, and obedience with his new hooman.\n\nTrike had been hit by a car and due to this has a limp (no broken bones, hurray!) - which is healing under a local vet's supervision. This injury can take at least 6 months to heal, and he may have a limp forever. But he was cleared to find his furever home now!\n\nWith the history of being hit by a car, a fenced in yard is preferred. Trike would love a home with an active lifestyle, his leg does not slow him down at all! Kids 10 years and up would be best as he is very playful. He would possibly like a spayed/neutered playmate.\n\nThis boy would be an awesome companion!",

He loves being under warm soft blankets. Max has a pretty good idea what retirement life should look like, and he would do best in a calm home environment.\nIf you would like to meet Max, fill out an application and the Bella staff will arrange it",

I like to take light evening walks and spend the rest of day snuggled up in a good warm spot! I can be a shy at first, so I would prefer a home with older kids. I may be able to live with other dogs, as long as they know to be gentle with an older lady like myself. I'd love to meet your family, including dogs here at the shelter, so please make an appointment to come visit me! \n\nI'm Beemer's Buddy! Thanks to Chapman BMW Camelback you can take me home for FREE!\n\nhttps://aawl.org/content/appointment-based-adoptions\n\nAAWL recommends I live with humans MIDDLE SCHOOL age and older.\nAAWL thinks I am TOLERANT of other dogs\nAAWL thinks my exercise level is NOW AND THEN\nAAWL does not know if I can live with cats at this time.",

            "description": "Hi my name is Emmett. I am a Great Pyrenees mix. Maybe mixed with Lab? And aren't I just so handsome? My owner surrendered me because she was commuting for school and no longer able to give me the care and attention I deserve. I was an outside dog before I came to rescue, but I have learned that I like to be inside with my people and 4 legged friends. My new owners will need to have a little patience with me to get over my shyness, but once I do I will show you my personality! I really need another canine friend in my new home and I also like cats. I am working on leash training and prefer quiet walks, avoiding busy roads because I'm not used to all the noises. Some of my favorite things are toys that crinkle, bacon cheese dog biscuits, and lounging on my foster mom's bed. I also like to snuggle! I am house trained, have mastered sit, and am working on other commands. I will come to you neutered, up to date on vaccinations, up to date on flea/tick preventives, and microchipped. \n\nApplicants must have a secure and visible fence. In order for your application to be approved you must pass a home check and a vet check which includes having at least a two year vet history. I can be adopted in Missouri and surrounding states: Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Michigan. My rescue is able to transport me to those states. If you would like to give me a furever home, please fill out an application on my rescue's website. \n\nBeing fostered in Bradley, IL",

He will make a fantastic addition to almost any ship crew as he is a friendly boy who loves to play with toys once he's gotten to know you! We do recommend a home without children under 12yrs for him. He has been a little bit forward and excitable when meeting other dogs, so any resident canines will have to come for a meet and greet to ensure compatibility. We don't know if he's ever met cats, but we think he would do best in a home without any resident felines. Sailor is looking for a forever ship to call his own. Are you ready to sail the seven seas with this sweetheart? Call the Adoptions department today to book your visit with Sweet Sailor!

            "description": "BELLA IS IN A FOSTER HOME\n\nDate of birth:  11/2016\n\n1/26/2021:  Bella is an adorable little Beagle/American Staffordshire mix!  She\u2019s  4 years old and weighs 35 lbs\u2014 she\u2019s a nice size.  \n\n\u2022  Bella is extremely sweet natured.  The poor girl has had a rough life. She was living on the streets with her puppies. She\u2019d belonged to somebody at some time, though, and was neglected\u2014 she had multiple collars that had become embedded into her neck. She was so patient while we removed them from her neck. \n\n\u2022 Bella is doing great in her foster home. She is playful and loves to play fetch.  She\u2019s very food motivated and she can catch treats in her mouth when you toss them to her!\n\n\u2022 Bella is sometimes a little shy with new people, so it may take her a bit to warm up when you initially meet her.  But once she\u2019s comfortable she\u2019s very loving and she loves attention. \n\n\u2022 We don\u2019t want to place her in a home with young kids.  We think she\u2019d be fine with teenagers who\u2019ve been raised with dogs and know to be respectful while she adjusts to her new home.  \n\n\u2022 We\u2019d like Bella to have a house with a fenced yard for her to play in.\n\n\u2022 Bella gets along well with other dogs and lives with other dogs in her foster home.  If you have a dog, we\u2019d ask you to bring your dog in to meet Bella to see if they could be buddies. \n\n\u2022 Bella is crate trained and house trained. She uses a doggie door in her foster home.\n\n\u2022 She\u2019s been spayed, vaccinated, microchipped and tested for heartrworms.  She is such a sweetheart and she\u2019s endured a hard life. She\u2019s ready for a home where she\u2019ll get lots of love and attention! \n\nMORE ON ADOPTING OUR DOGS... \n\n> COVID-19 UPDATE:  PLEASE SUBMIT AN ONLINE ADOPTION APPLICATION AND A MEMBER OF OUR ADOPTIONS TEAM WILL REACH OUT TO YOU.  Please visit our web site at HSGKC.ORG for an adoption application, our current COVID-19 adoption protocol, and other adoption info.\u00a0\n\n> If you decide you'd like to adopt one of the pets you meet, we reserve the pet for you but we generally don't send the pet home with you that day. We\u2019ll instead schedule a pick up date and time that\u2019s convenient for you.\u00a0  \n\n> Our goal is to send you home with a healthy pet and any information and support you may need to help your new pet adjust to his or her new home.  All of our dogs & puppies have been spayed or neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, treated for fleas & ticks, tested for heartworms (7 mo. and over), and are on monthly heartworm preventative. Puppies who are too young to receive all the necessary puppy boosters and/or first rabies shot may be brought back to us for those vaccines at no extra charge. You will also receive a leash, collar, coupons for pet supplies and services, toys, and educational materials. And we'll give your dog a bath before he or she goes home! \n\n> Please note that we prefer and may require a fenced yard for many of our dogs.  Exceptions are made on an individual basis depending on the dog's needs, the person's dog experience, the dog's and person's activity levels, home environment and other factors. \n\nThank you for searching for a shelter pet!\n\nDog Adoption Contact Info:\nEmail: christine@hsgkc.org\nPhone: 913.521.2339\nhsgkc.org",

            "description": "Logan is a 1-2 year old Pit bull mix. He is loose and wiggly. He comes when called and will stay next to his person. He likes to give gentle chin nudges. Logan will lean for attention. He is high energy so this guy will need plenty of playtime and exercise! He pulls on a leash but with some basic obedience training, this could easily be resolved. He is food motivated and knows the sit command. He is not a fan of cats in a shelter environment. Dogs are generally tested with dogs of their own size; and dog meets with the resident dogs are always encouraged. Our cat test should be used as a general purpose screening only to rule out overt aggression; we always recommend caution when introducing dogs to cats in the home. Recommendation on suitability of placement with children by their ages is based on behavioral observations including energy level and response to body handling. We never recommend leaving young children unsupervised with dogs, and we cannot guarantee the behavior of dogs with children, other pets or cats. Behavior evaluations should be considered as a snapshot of the behavior of the dog at this point in time; JHS believes all dog families need to be prepared to invest time and energy into training as well as provide common sense management of their new dog. We always encourage family to do some research on the breeds or mixes of breeds prior to adoption as many can have some unique characteristics that may or may not fit into their families. Always remember that the majority of dogs at our shelter have been exposed to or may have kennel cough. Kennel cough is contagious to other dogs, please talk to your vet if you have any questions about kennel cough prior to adoption. Please ask your adoption counselor at time of adoption if you have any unanswered questions regarding illnesses and treatments of the path that you are adopting. For more information about this dog or any others at our Shelter, please visit www.joplinhumane.org. We are the Joplin Humane Society in Joplin, Missouri. 417-623-3642",

            "description": "Xena is a 4-5 year old Boxer mix. She comes when called but will not stay with her person with interaction. She likes to give gentle kisses. Xena Is high energy so this gal will need plenty of exercise and playtime. She pulls on a leash but with some basic obedience training, this could easily Be resolved. She is food motivated. She knows the sit and down command. Xena is afraid of cats in a shelter atmosphere. We due not recommend children under 8 years of age due to her high anxiety. Dogs are generally tested with dogs of their own size; and dog meets with the resident dogs are always encouraged. We recommend RESCUE ONLY due to her anxiety. Dogs are generally tested with dogs of their own size; and dog meets with the resident dogs are always encouraged. Our cat test should be used as a general purpose screening only to rule out overt aggression; we always recommend caution when introducing dogs to cats in the home. Recommendation on suitability of placement with children by their ages is based on behavioral observations including energy level and response to body handling. We never recommend leaving young children unsupervised with dogs, and we cannot guarantee the behavior of dogs with children, other pets or cats. Behavior evaluations should be considered as a snapshot of the behavior of the dog at this point in time; JHS believes all dog families need to be prepared to invest time and energy into training as well as provide common sense management of their new dog. We always encourage family to do some research on the breeds or mixes of breeds prior to adoption as many can have some unique characteristics that may or may not fit into their families. Always remember that the majority of dogs at our shelter have been exposed to or may have kennel cough. Kennel cough is contagious to other dogs, please talk to your vet if you have any questions about kennel cough prior to adoption. Please ask your adoption counselor at time of adoption if you have any unanswered questions regarding illnesses and treatments of the path that you are adopting. For more information about this dog or any others at our Shelter, please visit www.joplinhumane.org. We are the Joplin Humane Society in Joplin, Missouri. 417-623-3642",

Morty had to be on exercise restrictions due to his heartworm treatment and has flourished since being able to run and play with other dogs after completing treatment. He is high energy but will settle down and watch television with you at night. He would love a family that is active or a high energy doggie sibling to help him use his energy. He annoys his low energy (senior citizen) foster brother as well as his small foster brother (20 pounds) because he is very \"touchy feely\" but he loves to run and play with his 80 and 50 pound foster dog brothers. Morty is confined to a small room when his foster mom isn't home. He will howl for a few minutes but settles down well.  Morty is potty trained. He does not live with children but he is super friendly with everyone he meets on walks. Since he likes to jump, he would probably do well in a family without children or with older children in case he jumps. Morty has never met a toy he didn't like, or a treat! Mortimer has a cat foster sister and he is overzealous but not aggressive. He will stop chasing her with the \"no\" command.  Morty clearly had a rough start to life but he is ready to find his perfect ending and he hopes that is you. Morty's adoption fee is $250. \n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

He arrived from Idaho Falls last week and has been decompressing in his wonderful foster home while we got him on the right track. As you can see, his skin is not in the greatest condition. Although his previous owner loved him dearly they could not accommodate his special diet needs so they did what was best for him to get him where he needed to be to find the right home. We suspect he has severe food allergies and will need to be a Hydrolyzed Protein diet. We are working closely with the team at Jackson Animal Hospital to get him on the right track! He has done well with all cats and dogs so far and is gaining his confidence with meeting new people!\n\nPlease note, Animal Adoption Center cannot guarantee the breed, composition or ages of our dogs as we usually have no history prior to them entering the rescue. We make every effort to ensure the dogs are healthy.\n\nPlease know that our intention is to insure long lasting committed homes for the animals at the AAC.

We will form a line like usual based on who has an active and approved application in. We will go through our line to set up a private meet and greet for potential adopters to foster.\n307-739-1881\nadopt@animaladoptioncenter.org\n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/42994530730154\n\nJames\n1-2 year old, male\nCattle Dog Mix\n\nMeet James, a 1-2 year old, male, Cattle Dog mix who is lovely! He has been with us for a few weeks but we had to address an injured hip before he was up to adoption! He received a femoral head ostectomy at Jackson Animal Hospital and is ready to find a forever home. He has done well with dogs and kids and will need someone that can help him finish his rehab!\n\nA note from his foster: \"He will do ANYTHING for a belly rub or treat and loves puzzle toys. Lives to please his person. Very smart and learning basic commands very quickly. Housebroken and now crate trained and uses a doggy door. He has a shoe fetish and likes to relocate them to enhance your morning with a nice 6am scavenger hunt. A little reserved with new dogs at first if they're too rambunctious but enjoys wrestling and playing keep-away with the playful ones. Overall he's a big puppy, can be a little mouthy (just like a puppy, not mean) but is learning quickly with consistency. Oh and a huge comfort hound! You can always count on him to find the most luxurious bed in the house and claim his spot for a good snooze!\"\n\nPlease note, Animal Adoption Center cannot guarantee the breed, composition or ages of our dogs as we usually have no history prior to them entering the rescue. We make every effort to ensure the dogs are healthy.\n\nPlease know that our intention is to insure long lasting committed homes for the animals at the AAC. If we feel that an animal and a potential owner are not a good fit we reserve the right to refuse adoption.",

I'll love to see and do things with my forever family, and I'd really like a busy home life too. An energetic dog like me will need a companion who's able to offer plenty of exercise and mental stimulation every day, like hiking, jogging, or playing fetch.\nAll our animals are available for adoption, but some may not be ready to go home just yet.\nPlease call if you have questions on current status. 707.442.1782\n\nIf you are considering adopting from Sequoia Humane Society, filling out a general applicaiton is the first step. It's good for a year, and the oldest general application has first pick, when any animal becomes available for adoption.\n\nVisit us at Sequoia Humane Society or like us on Facebook",

            "description": "Double Dot is a petite little girl with adorable cow spots and a BIG personality. She arrived to RACC as a stray with no known history, but it took her no time at all to let that fun personality shine! Dot has been a volunteer favorite, as she walks nicely on leash and loves to play in the yard between giving you kisses. Double Dot has a wild play style and is jumpy and excitable (she means well!), so a home with young children may not be best for her. This play style is also similar with other dogs, but she may be able to go home with another dog who can tolerate her shenanigans! Dot thrives when she has stimulation and exercise, so she's hoping her next human will take her hiking or on other outdoor adventures. That said, she is not an ideal apartment dog and will do much better in a home with a yard where she can run. If you're looking for an adventure partner rather than a couch potato, ask to meet with Dot!\n Primary Color: White Secondary Color: Black Weight: 41lbs Age: 1yrs 0mths 3wks Animal has been Spayed",

She is a pit/lab mix and is the perfect age of 5 years. Midnight will make a great walking partner and in the same day she will make a great couch potato. She is very loyal to who she loves and is friendly with everyone she meets once they gain her trust. She would prefer to be the only pet in the home.Midnightbis a very smart girl and knows lots of commands! It took her time to adjust to the shelter environment as she was still searching for her past. She has turned a page and has accepted the reality that she will find a new family to watch after and that everything happens for a reason. If you are interested in meeting Midnight, please fill out a questionnaire (either in person or online at gobroomecounty.com/shelter). If you have any questions or would like to know more about Midnight, call the Broome County Dog Shelter att (607)778-2493 or shoot us an email at muttsrus@broomecounty.us.",

Bambi was caught first and a few days later Animal Control was able to trap Flower and bring her to us. Although these two avoided capture once they were caught we were thrilled to find out they are very sweet and love people! These girls wont have to live on the streets ever again- we would love to find them wonderful homes who can show them what the good life is all about.

No skin issues were appreciated, and his neuter site appears healthy. No treatment is needed. \n1/17 (Intake Exam) -- Red; irritated eyes. Testicles look very red and irritated.\n1/8 (Intake Exam) -- Eyes - irritation/abrasion around eyes. Ears - small abrasions in ears. Mouth/Teeth/Gums - irritation/abrasion around mouth\n\nBehavior Observation: \n1/29 (Per Staff) -- Please be cautious when taking out and returning to kennel. Dog is highly kennel reactive, he will escalate when being returned and it could lead to a bite. \n1/26 (Per Staff) Approached kennel, and was easily able to remove Ace. Greeted at the door loose and wiggly. Pulled moderately on leash. Continued to check in with handler. Became overstimulated after a few minutes outside and started to hump and then leash bite. Ace continued to pull at the leash, and attention could not be redirect until another staff member called him over. Returned to walking on the leash, but started to leash bite/ tug on the leash when being returned to kennel. Handler stepped into kennel and ace followed allowing to be returned to kennel.\n1/21 (Per Vet) -- Friendly and easy to handle for exam. Attempted to nip when being placed back into kennel (also observed in adoptive home)\n1/17 (Per Vet) -- Friendly; BAR\n1/9 (Per Volunteer) Kennel Presentation - Easy to leash/social. Does not want to return to kennel. Leash Skills - Pulls Strongly On Leash. Handleability - Loose/Allows all handling. Humper but then becomes a hugger. Will stay attached if handler allows humping to continue. Engages in tag. Gives toys up willingly. Evaluated Blue.\n1/8 (Per Vet) BAR; FRIENDLY\n1/8 (Per APO) The dog is in the house on his cage. I put my stick on his neck and he scare but never aggressive with us .\n1/8 (Per Previous Owner) attacked and killed her cat and is now acting aggressively towards her when she tries to feed him. he lived in the home with two chihuahua and two cats and got along well with them for 10 months - according to owner Cerberus was playing with one of the chihuahua and the cat ran past them and Cerberus attacked the cat and killed it - the owner put Cerberus in the cage but when she went to go feed him his behavior seemed as if he would bite her. owner stated he just likes to chase children so she usually puts him away in another room when kids are around but usually Cerberus is allowed to roam freely in the home. Owner stated his behavior around adults and said that he is very hyperactive but friendly and likes to jump on people which people usually do not like and sometimes get scared but he has no bite history with people.\n\nBITE DETAILS\n1/16 - Adopter reported to me that they had just gotten home from adopting Ace, he was on a leash and Mr Valdez went to put Ace in the crate but instead Ace turned around and bit the owner on the arm and the finger. Did not break skin, did not cause bleeding but did leave a scratch mark. Mr Valdez stated to me that he knows Ace is a good dog and he can probably work with Ace but his girlfriend is now scared of the dog and does not want him \n1/16 - While being returned to kennel by a volunteer, he began leash biting and refusing to return to kennel. Approached by staff member to assist, and Cerberus, clearly overstimulated/overwhelmed with flailing body, redirected and nipped at staff member's leg through jeans. Did not break skin. Staff then went to other side of kennel, opened door, and encouraged dog to step back into kennel via the other side. Volunteer was then able to close door behind, leaving leash on. When volunteer attempted to open door back up to retrieve leash, dog then began pushing to get of kennel again. During this time, dog again became mouthy, jumping up on volunteer and nipped at hands, drawing a small amount of blood. Leash was removed, however, door was shut carefully. Band-aid used to cover finger. Dog remained over-stimulated but friendly.",

For now we are looking for a foster home where he can be active and learn some more house manners; a home where someone has had previous success in positive reinforcement dog training would be awesome.  He needs space, a fenced yard, and ideally no other pets.  That would be the safest bet, as we haven't had a chance to test him with other dogs, cats, or anything else.  He loves people, though!\n\nYou can put a bit of zip and lots of affection into your life by helping  Moochie! If you're interested, please email connellpetrescue@gmail.com OR go straight to filling out an application.

            "description": "Lindy came from an overcrowded shelter in Arkansas. She\u2019s a sweet girl who loves to play with her resident dog outside. Tug of war is a favorite game. Has not  barked. Very good in the kennel, hasn't messed it and sleeps through the night. Hasn't noticed the cats but loves the resident human boys. Always moving when not sleeping. Would love a fenced yard or play time at the dog park!\n\nAdoption Fee: $450 (cash/card only) \n\nFoster to call: Jennifer 952-431-9910\n\nDue to the recommendations about the coronavirus, we are not able to have group adoption events at PetSmart.  We are, however, allowed to do individual adoptions so if you are interested in this pup/dog, please contact the foster listed above to set up a meeting.  We look forward to continuing to save dogs with you and will resume group adoptions as soon as we can.  Thank you for your patience and understanding.\n\nOur fosters do the best they can to provide all information about the animal's background and temperament while in foster care in their home.  An adopters routine and home environment is likely going to be different than that in their foster home.  Sometimes there is more that comes out about a dog's personality once they have been able to settle in a home & truly become comfortable.  There are great articles out there written about the different stages a pet goes through after adoption; discussing transitions that happen at 3 days, 3 weeks, & 3 months.  We highly recommend reading about this - it will help you understand the transition your new pet goes through.   \n\nLast Hope, Inc. is an all volunteer, foster based, no kill rescue! You can see almost all of our dogs on Saturdays from 11am - 3pm at Lakeville PetSmart (located by Hy-Vee just off 160th & Pilot Knob) & Burnsville Petsmart (located just off Hwy 35E & County Rd 42 by Chianti Grill).\n\nPolicies: You do not have to have a fence to adopt a dog from us, but some dogs will require a fence or acres to play, or an active family who will make sure the dog gets the exercise it needs to be happy.  Some dogs do not have the temperament that will do well with young children.   \n\nThe Adoption Fee is not enough to cover the vet bills. Sales tax of almost 7.25% is also included in the adoption fee that you see. Please consider donating to Last Hope to help us save these animals!\n\nCAN YOU FOSTER? By taking a dog or puppies temporarily into your home and then coming to our adoption days to help find them homes, we can save more! If you\u2019re interested, please email our dog coordinator: jaime3369@gmail.com and give us your contact information and what you would like to foster and someone will get back to you! You can also apply to be a foster home on our webpage! In the upper left hand corner there\u2019s a drop down tab with the link for canine foster home. Just fill it out online & submit! We will get back to you as quick as we can.",

She loves, loves, loves people and is really quite gentle with volunteers and staff. It was hard to pry BRANDY away from Miss Donna and volunteer Jordan, but we did end up capturing some pictures of this big, beautiful girl on a brisk winter morning in the hopes that an adopter finds her as wonderful as many of the staff and volunteers. \n\nThe video really does capture this beauty's personality: loving and loyal.\n\nBRANDY LYNN needs an experienced owner that has large dog experience. We are also requesting a placement without children (due to Brandy's size and energy, not temperament). BRANDY does not get along with all dogs, so she needs to be in a one-dog home. Despite the long list of musts for BRANDY LYNN, we know her adopter is out there. \n\n-Must have fenced yard\n-Experienced dog owner preferred. \n\n*No Children\n* One dog home\n\nAdoption Application: https://thearkanimalshelter.org/adoption-application/\nDownload and complete the application.\nEmail to arkanimalshelter@yahoo.com.\nOnce your application is approved, you will be contacted for a MEET and GREET.\n\nMEET and GREET is by appointment only.\nQuestions: 309-246-4275\n",

ANNIE is a graduate of our Paws Behind Bars prison dog program where she did very well and now knows basic obedience.   From the prison she went to a great foster home with a young couple in an apartment  (so we know she can handle that lifestyle)   Her likes?   PEOPLE and PEANUT BUTTER!   Her dislikes?   She doesnt like to be left alone and while she'll tolerate other dogs she likes them better from afar.   She is a lovely companion,  that is a great walking partner.   Her energy level is perfect for someone wanting a quieter dog.   If interested in adopting,  our process begins with the application which you can find at www.adoptmebluegrasspetrescue.",

I'm sure I can adjust quickly to changes and a new environment. If your household is somewhat busier and more active, I might just be the right dog! A sociable dog like me usually gets along well with other pets too.\nAll our animals are available for adoption, but some may not be ready to go home just yet.\nPlease call if you have questions on current status. 707.442.1782\n\nIf you are considering adopting from Sequoia Humane Society, filling out a general applicaiton is the first step. It's good for a year, and the oldest general application has first pick, when any animal becomes available for adoption.\n\nVisit us at Sequoia Humane Society or like us on Facebook",

            "description": "**Hello! Derek is currently staying in a foster home. If you'd like to schedule a time to meet him please call Wayside's Adoption Center at 816-986-4426. Thanks!**\nHi there, Im Derek! Im friendly and affectionate and silly and fun. There is no place on this earth Id rather be than right by your side, basking in the feeling of closeness as you pet me and tell me about your day. Ill even climb up on your lap, if you let me! Despite my big stature, sometimes Im just a little lap dog in my mind. Ha! Ill be your constant companion if you just give me a chance.\nIm a handsome, 8 year old, 69-pound sweetheart with an adorable furrowed brow and a delightful personality. And I think Im already mostly housebroken, but please stay patient with me when we get home, as I get used to my new routine with you. I first came to Wayside as a stray when I was only a year old. I was adopted, but then ended up as a stray once again. Life can be tough out there on your own, especially for a dog that loves people as much as I do. What I really want is to share my life with you and to be your family. I might be a senior, but I have so very much love left to give.\nMaybe because of all the instability Ive had in my life, I can be a little shy and nervous when first meeting new people. I warm up quickly though and, once we bond, I like to lean into you to show you my love and affection. With time, I become a playful, happy, outgoing dog who loves to play with my toys and balls. Im an expert at the game of fetch! Im big and strong, so when I joyfully jump around, I can be like a bull in a china shop. Good thing Im smart and easy to redirect when I get too rowdy! I already know all sorts of commands that I cant wait to show you and Id love to learn more. I hope youll continue my training throughout my life. I will thrive if you stay patient, calm, positive, and consistent with me. I love tasty treats and praise, so just let me know when Im a good boy and Ill be all over it! \nNow that Ive been at the shelter for a while, I get chosen to do fun stuff with the staff and volunteers. I love to go for field trips! Im content when riding in the car. And Im friendly and social with everyone I meet when Im out and about. I even let kids pet me. I love belly rubs and I soak up the attention of all my new friends. I have a gentle, easy-going temperament. I also get to be an office foster dog on occasion, meaning I help the staff with their work throughout the day. Im well behaved and a nice friend to spend your day with. I mostly like to nap on the couch or cuddle, but other times I try to get my friends to take a break from their work to pet me. Im also good at keeping myself entertained with toys. I do have a loud bark when I have something to say! I cant wait until the day when I get adopted and I get to go to a real home!\nI love to go for walks and I do pretty well on my leash. I am strong though, so a harness helps to keep me from pulling. I like to focus on our time together during my walks and I dont like to meet other dogs along the way. I will need a home as your only dog and I dont want to spend time in dog parks or doggy daycare or whatnot. I just need to be your one and only friend, but I promise Ill give you so much love and attention that I will be enough!\nIm just a simple dog who has never had much in life. I long for a peaceful, safe, stable life with people I love. I want to share my life with you and be there for you whenever you need me. I will be your best friend and Ill show you how it feels to be loved unconditionally. Im an expert at that! Please come to meet me soon!\nLove, Derek\n ...",

She needs to go to a home with a fenced in yard so that she can safely run and play. She loves to be outside playing in the snow and playing with toys, especially balls. Just like a cat, she bats the balls around and chases them. \n\nIf interested, please fill out an application found here https://peisandstrays.com/adoption-application/ \n\nPippi is being fostered in Rochester NY and will be adopted out locally",

            "description": "Meet Arthur, our very handsome 7 year old Shar Pei. Arthur is a very good boy and loves to go for walks and have his backend stratched. He arrived to our shelter in rough shape with a severe upper respiratory infection and some skin issues. We are treating him for that and cannot wait to see how much better he feels! With Arthurs eyes and ears infected, you do need to approach him slowly as to not startle him. He is such a lovely boy!\nWe have been told Arthur was given up because he didn't get along with a new dog in the home. He doesn't seem to mind being around his kennelmates here at the shelter.\n\nTo view the adoptable dogs at our shelter, you must fill out an adoption application found on our website. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are showing dogs on an appointment only basis. Please understand that we are receiving a high volume of applications at this time and are doing our best to address as many as we can. Please be patient. Thank you.\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs is $250. Aside from the shelter, food and water, exercise and compassion they receive while in our care, this also includes veterinary services such as Rabies, Distemper+Lepto, Bordetella, H3N2/H3N8 Influenza, heartworm testing, fecal exams, preventions and deworming medications. Spays/Neuters are also included as part of the adoption fee as is microchipping. \nPuppies under the age of 6 months have an adoption fee of $350. The veterinary services rendered include puppies first round of vaccines, fecal exams, deworming medications, preventions, and microchipping. Our facility spays and neuters dogs at 6 months of age. If the puppy is adopted prior to his, or her prescheduled surgery date, a $200 spay/neuter deposit will be taken on the day of adoption. This deposit it refundable and will be returned to the adopter once proof of the procedure is returned to the shelter. \nCOVID-19 NOTE: Please understand that we are looking for forever home for our pets. We understand that many people have a lot of time on their hands during the COVID-19 pandemic, so this may seem like an ideal time to bring home a new pet. Please be sure you are prepared to give your new pet his, or her forever home once our lives go back to normal. They deserve it. Thank you and stay safe.",

If you are interested in Paco, please complete the on-line application that can be found on our website: www.adoptmerescue.org. or contact us for more information.\n\n\n\n",

COVID has brought its challenges this year and the pup's family recently lost their home and couldnt take her with them.   She has grown up with a loving family - children and another dog - and is looking to once again,  find herself back in that enviroment.   She is very pretty and has a lovely temperament.   She's good on a leash and does well in a crate.  She's now a year and a half old and weighs 45 lbs.

PURPLE\u2013 Dogs in the PURPLE category are very shy and will need equally patient adopters that have experience in confidence building. Dogs in the PURPLE category may also benefit from having another confident canine in the home.\n\nDogs are assigned to color categories using any previous owner notes, general handling, as well as staff and volunteer observations. As we continue to get to know the dogs and gather further insights into their personalities, colors may be adjusted accordingly.\n\nRancho Coastal Humane Society remains temporarily closed to the general public, but we have companion animals in our care that are ready for adoption BY APPOINTMENT ONLY, and our staff is ready to make that happen! Please visit our website for updates and more information. Thank you for your interest. \n\nAdoption Hours: Monday-Sunday; 11 AM to 4:30 PM\n\nAddress: 389 Requeza Street, Encinitas, CA 92024",

Let me tell you a bit about myself; I am a 50lb, 7 year old, Husky who is ready to meet his Furever Family! \n\nI am told by my hooman friends how handsome, sweet and goofy I am... I don't really know what that means but the hoomans smile, then give me kisses and pets when they say it, so when they say it I'm thinking what they are saying is  a good thing, so I give kisses right back!\n\nWhere was I? Oh yes I was telling you about ME! I like to meet other doggies but they may need a minute to warm up to my sunny disposition. I love all sizes and ages of hoomans too but I can't have those smaller and younger hoomans to be TOO small or young! As you might be able to see from my pictures, my right eye looks a bit funny. It's due to a condition that makes me blind in that eye, but what the hoomans don't know, is that it actually sees into the future.... Wait I'm getting something... I see my future furever family! Hopefully they find me soon! \n\nIf you are interested in meeting me, please email adoption@sdsanctuary.com to schedule a visit with me!",

This brother and sister duo are 5yr old Pug/Terrier mixes. They both weigh approximately 24lbs and are done growing. They both get along with other dogs and have even lived with cats. They are friendly and have lived with children of all ages! Zuma is very outgoing where Marshall is a little shy at first. Once he has been given the ok by his sister, he is the biggest sweetheart. They both are housebroken, kennel trained and even know how to use a doggie door. Zuma and Marshall love to go on walks and do well on car rides. Zuma, unfortunately started experiencing seizures at home and when at the groomer. With the help of her daily meds of Levetiracetam she has been successfully enjoying life without a problem. Zuma and Marshall are spayed and neutered, are up to date on vaccines, microchipped and vet checked. Their adoption fee is $400 (for the pair) which includes a complimentary veterinary visit.

I looove walks, enjoy the occasional jog, and will play fetch whenever and wherever. I hope snuggle time lasts all day long. I\u2019m a smart gal and I\u2019ll listen when you need me too. I\u2019m super cute when I snooze too. My adoption fee is $250.00.\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

It always take time for these Mom's to come back into good condition.   They are often thin from feeding their litters without proper nutrition.  Their skin & coats are dry for the same reason.   Then there's the transition between caring for young ones to becoming the center of attention.   Bella is currently in a great foster home with other dogs and doing great.   She loves to cuddle as well as play.   She had a few initial accidents but is now very much house trained.   She weighs 47 lbs and is full grown.   If interested in adopting, our process begins with the application which can be found at www.adoptmebluegrasspetrescue.",

I have been at the shelter since Jan 23, 2021. Meet Colt! This handsome and smart fella came to the shelter as a stray so shelter staff are still getting to know him. Personality: Colt can be a bit shy when meeting new people but warms up quickly with patience and treats! Once comfortable, he is extremely playful and affectionate. He knows how to sit and give paw! History: His history with other dogs is unknown, however we recommend no small pets (cats, dogs, etc). We always recommend slow and careful introductions over time to any resident pets. Energy levels: Colt has ALL the energy! He would love to run all day with you and play fetch in your backyard! Ideal home: Due to Colt`s handsome singing voice, he is not fit for homes with shared walls (apartments, condos, etc). He would GREATLY appreciate a FULLY FENCED yard, as once he warms up, he is an energetic boy! Due to his past, he cannot be left unattended outside. Family: Colt would love to go to a home with TEENS/ADULTS that have shy dog experience, as everyone needs to be able handle his size/energy. Everyone in the home should be present at time of meeting. Does he sound like the big boy for you? Come down and meet him today! **THIS DOG IS NOT AT OUR SHELTER EMAIL DOGFOSTER@THEHUMANESOCIETY.ORG**",

My buddy and me, We're the best friends that could be. My Buddy, My Buddy, My Buddy and Me! Children of the 80s will remember that jingle (and have it stuck in their heads for the next 2-5 weeks). My Buddy was a childs toy, but with this sweet, handsome pooch, my Buddy takes on a whole new, and way better meaning! Buddy may not actually want to climb a tree with you, but he definitely wants to learn from you and be your very best friend!! In his prior home, Buddy did well with a resident Chihuahua and with kids as young as 4. He was an outdoor pet in his last home, so needs to find a forever home where hell have a place inside with his family. Buddy is a sweet, squishy, affectionate boy who loves being with his person. When meeting other dogs in PACC playgroup, Buddy was tolerant, playful and respectful of corrections from both the other dogs and the handlers in the yard. Buddy should meet any resident dogs before heading home to make sure its a good fit- what if they think Cabbage Patch Kids are the superior toy??? Blasphemy!!",

I really like it so far.  I go into my crate when asked and am nice and quiet in it.  I've only had one accident in the house so far, which is pretty good since I'm used to living outside.  My foster mom tells me I'm the best boy.  I love running around the yard with my foster siblings (they are big and small) & will sometimes chase the cat when he runs by me.  I'm learning to play with toys and like them so far.  I'm pretty obedient, but could use some basic manners since I'm a big boy. I'm learning to walk on a leash and am pretty strong.  If you think you are ready for a friendly fluffy friend in your life, apply today!  My adoption fee is $250.00.\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

Zac is still learning proper manners for playing with people, so we would love to find a home with teenage+ members. Although this is a playful pup, he likes to take his time getting to know new people so we suggest giving him lots of yummy treats. If you are interested in hearing more about Zac, or think he would be a good fit for your home, please give the shelter a call or stop in to talk to a member of our adoption team!\n\nZac is neutered, up-to-date on vaccines, and microchipped. \n\nPLEASE NOTE: While visiting the shelter, you MUST wear a face mask and social distance.",

            "description": "Introducing Buddy - a lovable goofball looking for his forever home.  He is a smart boy just dying to show you all of his tricks - he can sit, lay down, and even shake.    He has a medium energy level.  He equally loves taking naps next to his people, going for a walk or a run, or playing fetch.  He does well with the other big dogs in his foster home, and he would make a great family dog.  \nHe is a neutered, 7-month-old dutch shepherd mix that currently weighs about 45 lbs.  He is still working on his housetraining but does know what to do when he goes outside.   He is extremely treat-motivated (which makes him guilty of a little counter surfing).  That, combined with his intelligence, should make him easy to train.\n\nBuddy was found as a stray and taken in by someone for two weeks while looking for his family. He was then surrendered to the shelter, where his microchip number was tracked further without result. Nobody came for him.\n\nHe has now found his way to our rescue and is looking for a new home. His energy level is moderate...not too bad for a puppy we were told. \n\nBuddy Does NOT crate well. He is great outside his crate but will dig and get  upset when confined in a crate.\n\n\nIf interested in adopting please fill out our no obligation online application at www.puppypawsrescue.org \n\nNote: Our rescue requires that all adopter's current and prior animals are up-to-date on vaccinations (DHLPP & Rabies)  and preventatives (heartworm and flea and tick), unless there is a medical reason not allowing it. All animals in your household should be spayed or neutered unless medically indicated that they should not be or are currently still too young.",

She was rescued with her Siblings and all of them have found homes. She did find a home but was too \"\"nippy\"\" with the small children so she has been returned. We are looking for an adopter with no small children and who is committed to training. She is an intelligent girl and will thrive with structure. The smarter a dog the more interaction mentally and physically. A fenced yard would be great for lots of working out puppy energy. \n\nBella's adoption fee of $350.00 includes her Vet exam, age appropriate vaccinations, fecal test and wormer. Heart worm preventative, spay and microchip.\n\n\nIf you live in the Austin area and are interested in adopting, please go to www.ForgottenFriendsTX.org and fill out an application. \n\nPlease be aware that we rarely have information on our dogs being good with cats as most of our foster homes don't have them. \n\nAdoption decisions are based on the best overall match and not done on a first-come-first-serve basis.",

They were told that we are between 8 - 10 years in age and I might be Paula's mom.  Our owner passed away and not much information was left about us.  We love to go to walks and love attention.  We have spent our whole lives together and want to continue with that so we do need to be adopted together. Apply for us today!\n\nMy adoption fee is $60.00. Adoption applications can be filled out at CCHS or online through our website, www.cchs-petshelter.org. Applications are not first come, first served. All applications will be reviewed by the adoption committee and the home chosen will be the one considered to be the best match. All dogs and puppies have been vaccinated for Distemper and Bordetella, dewormed and microchipped. If old enough, they will be vaccinated for Rabies and blood tested for Heartworm, Lymes, Anaplasmosis and Erlichiosis. Dogs and puppies will be spayed or neutered before adoption.\n\nCCHS is proud to be a No-Kill Humane Society. As a private, non-profit charity, our work depends on donations and volunteers to keep going. We are committed to helping the animals that enter our doors and finding each the best possible forever home. CCHS has been inspected and licensed by the Department of Animal Health - DATCP. Our license is #268235-DS",

They were told that we are between 8 - 10 years in age and Sadie might be my mom.  Our owner passed away and not much information was left about us.  We love to go to walks and love attention.  We have spent our whole lives together and want to continue with that so we do need to be adopted together. Apply for us today!\n\nMy adoption fee is $60.00. Adoption applications can be filled out at CCHS or online through our website, www.cchs-petshelter.org. Applications are not first come, first served. All applications will be reviewed by the adoption committee and the home chosen will be the one considered to be the best match.

PLEASE READ ENTIRE BIO BEFORE EMAILING****\n\n*Name: Milo \n*Age: 1 year\n*Current Weight: 70\n*Rescued from: Texas\n*Adoption fee: $375 \n*Health: up to date on required vaccines\n\nMeet Milo, this excited active boy is looking for his furever home. Unfortunately, his size and energy level quickly outgrew the apartment life of his previous family.  His previous owner had two young kids so Milo is good with kids.  Occasionally, when he's excited Milo can be a little mouthy so his new owner will need to continue correcting this behavior.   Milo's best home would have a fenced yard, no more apartment life for this sweet boy.  Another canine brother/sister of the same size would be wonderful for him but not required. Milo doesn't realize his own size and would probably play to rough with smaller dogs. His previous family had a stay-at-home mom so we would like his furever home to have someone home most of the time.  If you are looking for an active buddy and sweet boy to spoil, Milo might just be your guy. \n\nMilo was rescued from an area where there is an abundance of homeless dogs, and not a lot of shelter space for them to go while they wait for their forever homes. He will be arriving at SNARR's Adoption Center in Brewster, NY on February 15th ready for adoption! To apply to adopt Milo, fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. \n**Meet and greets will not be scheduled without an approved application.**\n\nIMPORTANT: For any dog or puppy that is not able to be spayed/neutered prior to adoption, SNARR requires a $125 deposit in addition to your adoption fee, as well as a strictly-enforced signed Spay/Neuter Contract stating you will have this dog altered within 6 months of adoption. The $125 deposit will be returned once the contract has been fulfilled. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n-------------------------------------------------------\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $375 for adults. Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n\n\n",

            "description": "Hello! My name is Miss Piggy. I am a 1 year old pit mix that weighs approx. 40-45lbs. I was originally found off of Stevens Road in Rockwall and never reclaimed. I am a friendly girl that enjoys going for walks as much as taking a nap on a couch. I do walk well on leash. I am working on crate training. I can be selective with other dogs so a meet and greet is required if you have other dogs in the home. I have never been around cats so that would be a new experience for me. My adoption fee is $125 which includes my spay, rabies, microchip, basic boosters, and heartworm test. If you are interested in making me a part of your family, please complete an adoption application located here: https://rockwalladoptions.com/adoptfoster/adoption-application/.All animals unless otherwise noted in their descriptions are at 1825 Airport Road, Rockwall, TX. Hours of operation are Monday through Friday 9 AM - 6 PM and Saturday 9 AM - 5 PM.

We are 1 hour from Okc or Tulsa, 8-5 BY APPOINTMENT\n\n4th\n\nFILL OUT APPLICATION at this link\n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/193595080362159\n\nAll pets are spayed/neutered, come with current rabies certification and tags, are up to date with other vaccinations, microchipped have tested negative for HW and are wormed every 4 weeks while here.\n\nThese pups were found wandering a small town living under a house :( that being said no I do not know what they are or how big they will be, I am guessing corgi mixes as there was a nearby corgi mix female we were unable to catch. Dad ?? who knows? They have now been fed well, had shots,(will need more) wormed and spayed so are ready for their new homes. Microchipped. These pups are very confident and have fought for everything in their lives so they are scared of nothing that means they need very attentive humans to keep them safe. They will be quite tenacious and probably very active. We prefer adopters who have some knowledge of a breed like this as they can be challenging. They need to be trained and worked with, not just allowed to grow up with no guidance. Fee is $225. We are asking visitors to wear masks for everyone safety, please.https://form.jotform.com/193595080362159\n\nPLEASE! DO NOT APPLY UNTIL THE DAY BEFORE YOU CAN PICK THE DOG UP!!! or it will likely be adopted before you get here\n\nIF YOU ARE SEEING IT, IT IS\nAVAILABLE\n!.\nMy site is updated daily.\n\nAll dogs carry an adoption fee which helps to pay for deworming, flea control, spay/neuter, HW test\nvaccinations and to fix any ailments they may have. The fee is usually less than the vet work they have had.\n\nThank You for considering adoption. Once approved and an appointment set, I will send directions\nSORRY I DO NOT SHIP DOGS\nFOR THE SAFETY AND COMFORT OF MY DOGS I DO REQUIRE ALL DOGS IN THE HOME BE\nSPAYED AND NEUTERED!",

The adoption fee includes the following: OH license good for this calendar year, DA2PP, Bordetella vaccine, Heartworm testing, dewormer, and spay/neuter.  Flea treatment will be provided if fleas are noticed.  All dogs will be spayed/neutered and microchipped before leaving the facility.  An e-collar may be purchased for $15.00.  Because most of our dogs were picked up as strays, we have no knowledge of any behavior or health issues.  Stray dogs are held for 72 hours so that the owners have a chance to redeem them. After that time they are vetted and placed up for adoption. We welcome and encourage the cross posting of our dog's pictures to increase adoptions.",

I just can\u2019t seem to settle down, well if you have a treat I will sit long enough to take it then I am off and on the go!  My colors are beautiful and I love to snuggle.  A nice scratch around the ears or a belly rub is always appreciated.  I have a lot of energy so it will be important that my new family takes me for long walks, hiking or maybe even running.  The more exercise I get the better behaved I will be in the home.  Tire me out!  My manners are still a work in progress.  I do know sit, give paw and lay down but I have a lot more to learn.  If you have never owned a hound please do a little research on my breed.  I don\u2019t bark often but when I do you will know it. My nose is constantly to the ground trying to find out what has been around.  I love all sorts of toys so stock up before you take me home.  I arrived on December 24 because there were too many animals in the home. I did have a litter of puppies and was a great mom bringing them up. If you think I will be a nice fit to your home please call to schedule a time to meet with me.\n",

            "description": "Hi, my name is Cane! I'm estimated to be a Boxer mix born around 3/18/2014. I weight around 50 pounds. I was surrendered to the shelter in Texas because I kept getting out of the yard.  I have lived with other dogs and love to play ball and go for walks.  I ride well in the car but want to ride shotgun.  I fence does keep me where I should be but I'll run off if loose so make sure to keep me contained.  Obedience classes for adult dogs and puppies can be incredibly helpful for both animals and humans. It helps you understand what makes me tick and will give me a better idea of what you want me to do. It\u2019s a win/win and it will also strengthen the bond between us! Apply for me today!\n\nMy adoption fee is $60.00. Adoption applications can be filled out at CCHS or online through our website, www.cchs-petshelter.org. Applications are not first come, first served. All applications will be reviewed by the adoption committee and the home chosen will be the one considered to be the best match. All dogs and puppies have been vaccinated for Distemper and Bordetella, dewormed and microchipped. If old enough, they will be vaccinated for Rabies and blood tested for Heartworm, Lymes, Anaplasmosis and Erlichiosis. Dogs and puppies will be spayed or neutered before adoption.\n\nCCHS is proud to be a No-Kill Humane Society. As a private, non-profit charity, our work depends on donations and volunteers to keep going. We are committed to helping the animals that enter our doors and finding each the best possible forever home. CCHS has been inspected and licensed by the Department of Animal Health - DATCP. Our license is #268235-DS",

Casper is a very sweet boy who gets along well with other dogs does well indoors and loves playing out in the yard with his dog pals. He plays great with large and medium size dogs, but we're not sure he has been around small dogs and he seemed way too playful and a bit rough around the cat he met, so a cat-free home would be best. He is a young boy, about 75-80 pounds and needs to gain some much needed weight. When he first arrived to the shelter he was shaved down as his coat was so rough, but it is growing in beautifully now. The shelter adopted him out and he was left alone outdoors with inadequate fencing, so he would go wandering around the neighborhood and ended up back at animal control again. The owners decided to surrender him so we are happy to have him in rescue so he can be adopted to a family that knows the breed and has a fenced yard. According to the kind family who found him, he loved belly rubs and snuggling on the floor with people, did well with their dogs, he learned to use the doggie door and did not try to escape their fencing. Sadly, he was not well cared for in his first home and came in very thin, but he had no food guarding issues at all and ate well with all of the other dogs. Casper was very frightened when he was brought back to the shelter so he may be fearful in new situations. He is a sweet boy who deserves a great family who will care for him and give him the great home he deserves!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nNGPR dogs are in foster homes throughout the U.S., NOT Beacon, NY. View full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.\n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

            "description": "Brisket is a dapper gentleman looking for a calm, cool, and collected household. As you can probably tell from his pictures - Brisket is visually impaired. A home with minimal stairs and children ages 12 and older would best suit this lovable fellas needs. Brisket has gotten along very well in his foster home and has never had any potty accidents. He has not been kenneled in his foster home, because he does not like the kennel and he is such a good boy and so well behaved he doesnt have to be. Brisket is a joy to take on walks, he has amazing leash manners and follows very well. He learned very quickly where his bed was, and his water and food bowls in the household. Brisket uses his nose and front paws to guide himself. He will need a bit of guidance by his human at first to become oriented with new surroundings. Brisket is a very quiet guy, only barks when hes chasing squirrels while dreaming. He has been in foster care with 2 dogs smaller than him and has been great. It would be best that Brisket is in a home with no dogs his size or larger, as they make him nervous and uneasy. This gentle and loving guy is ready for his forever home. \n\nBrisket was found as a stray dog wandering in the country in Southeast Missouri when he was taken in by Brave Animal Rescue. Routine bloodwork that was needed for him to be neutered showed unusual liver levels. An X-ray was done and we were shocked to find a bullet ludged in his liver. At this point, he is on a special liver food but the vet does not see a need for a risky surgery to remove the bullet. Brisket has also undergone lifesaving heartworm treatment. Lets find this total gem of a guy the best home ever, he deserves it!\n\nWe believe Brisket is around 5 years old and is a lab mix. He is fostered in a private home in Lincoln. The adoption fee is $350 which covers vaccines, a microchip, and a spay/neuter(when old enough). The adoption fee helps cover the cost of these vetting procedures. Unless the bio is marked adoption pending, s/he is still available for adoption. If youre interested in adopting this puppy, please submit an inquiry or email BraveAnimalRescue@gmail.com to ask about our adoption process (please check your spam or junk email if you do not hear back from us within a few business days). We are 100% volunteer staffed and will respond to your email as soon as possible. After you have submitted an application and been approved, we will set up a meet and greet between you and the puppy. Preference is given to applicants with a verifiable vetting history, fenced yard, and homeownership. Please be sure to follow us on Facebook and Instagram to learn more about Brave Animal Rescue and our mission.",

We process applications ONLY - there is no guarantee that you will get a response to an inquiry.\n\nMEET PRADA:\n\nPrada entered the shelter as a stray that was never reclaimed. She is estimated to be around 5 years old and weighs 68lbs. Prada is a super sweet girl, in fact she is quite a marshmellow! She is gentle with taking treats, has manageable energy and is always happy to meet new faces! Prada walks well on a leash and is crate trained, though she would prefer to be with people. She is not a chewer or destructive at all. She doesn't jump up on people and when she is really excited her little nub of a tail wags non-stop! Prada is good with other dogs but has not yet been introduced to cats. We would recommend a home with older children due to her size. \n\nUnfortunately, Prada has tested heartworm positive and will need to complete treatement before her adoption is finalized. Prada is seeking family that's ultimate goal is adoption while she undergoes heartworm treatment that is covered financially by the rescue; the treatment will take place over the next 5 months. Anyone interested in a foster-to-adopt opportunity will be required to follow the well defined treatment plan and transport Prada to her vet appointments that will include a spay surgery late February in Clinton Twp, and 3 heartworm injection appointments in April and May (also in Clinton Twp). She will require that she is kept quiet while she undergoes heartworm treatment, which shouldn't be difficult with her gentle nature. Dogs treated for heartworm typically enjoy happy, healthy long lives - the only future requirement is that they remain on heartworm prevention year round. Prada is a great dog that will make an amazing addition to some lucky family looking to love her furever!\n\nFurever Tails Animal Rescue covers all the costs for the mdeical care associated with the heartworm treatment. Fosters are required to follow the protocol provided by our veterinarian and approved by the American Heartworm Society. \n\nPrada is:\nCurrent on Rabies and Distemper\nDewormed\nHeartworm Tested: Positive and is currently undergoing treatment\nReceiving Heartworm and Flea Prevention\nMicrochipped\nScheduled to be spayed in February\nWill be treated for any medical concerns prior to finalizing adoption.\n\nADOPTION FEE: $275\n\nFUREVER TAILS IS A NON-PROFIT, NO-KILL, FOSTER HOME BASED ANIMAL RESCUE BASED OUT OF OAKLAND TOWNSHIP, MI. OUR FOSTER ANIMALS ARE LIVING IN FOSTER HOMES AND TREATED LIKE FAMILY UNTIL THEY FIND THEIR OWN FUREVER FAMILIES. OUR ADOPTION PROECESS REQUIRES AN APPLICATION TO BE COMPLETED AND APPROVED BEFORE A MEET-N-GREET WITH THE ANIMAL CAN TAKE PLACE. ADOPTION FEES ARE NECESSARY TO HELP US COVER VETTING COSTS FOR OUR RESCUED ANIMALS. UNFORTUNATELY AT THIS TIME WE ARE NOT CURRENTLY ADOPTING OUT OF THE STATE OF MI.",

All AAA dogs are up to date on all vaccinations, spayed or neutered, on heartworm preventative, and microchipped. \n\nDogs are individuals -- The shelter software system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of our dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix.

Patience with calm leadership is ideal for helping Roger become the perfect family member. He is learning to be more confident, social and well rounded in his foster home. Walking on the leash, meeting people and exploring the woods. Roger has been a great student. We feel as Roger is timid no young children for him. He would probably do best as an only dog.",

The homeowner had been feeding several strays and reached out to us to help the little family and get them out of the cold. We took her and four other dogs on the property, including another pregnant one that just had eight puppies.\n\nSallie did an amazing job of caring for her puppies but it took a toll on her and she was very malnourished and a little worse for the wear when we got her. A wonderful foster family welcomed Sallie Mae and her family and took wonderful care of them. The puppies all have applications and now it's Sallie Maes turn. \n\nShe is wonderful with people and fine with young kids. She is a little shy still, so we want to make sure she is in a secure home and one where she will get a lot of love, direction and guidance. If you would like to foster to adopt Sallie Mae, please go to www.atlantalabrescue.com to fill out an application.",

I rescued Lola from a shelter about a week ago when I was told that she was going to be put down if she was not picked up. Lola has been nothing but sweet towards my family, including my 4-year old son and developmentally disabled brother (who tends to be rough at times). She has greeted everyone with licks and always wants to be pet. However, as a mother, business owner, and nurse, I do not have the time necessary to provide Lola with the life that she deserves. \n\n\n\nLola would love to be placed with someone who spends most of their time at home. I could see her being very helpful to someone with anxiety or depression or who wants to be comforted at times, as she constantly likes to give her human(s) affection and show them that she is there. She is very easy-going and is content lounging around the house but also likes to go for walks and run around in the grass. \n\n\n\nLola has not had any accidents in the house and she has not chewed anything up. However, trash cans need to be put up (especially when no one is home) because Lola gets curious about food scraps! Lola is about 100 pounds and loves to cuddle. She does well with kids, likes to \u201cshake\u201d your hand, and loves being outside! \n\n\n\nLola\u2019s complete background is unknown. She is usually very quiet and doesn\u2019t bark but when approached by men that she doesn\u2019t know, she barks and sometimes growls. Her paperwork from the previous shelter that she was rescued from states that she bit a person or another animal, but no further details were given by the previous owner or shelter. However, the previous owner also lied about this dog, saying that she was already put down, so the reliability of the biting claim is unknown. Lola has been sweet to everyone she has spent time with so far and even lets my 4-year old climb all over her. The employee at the previous shelter also shared that they did not see any signs of aggression with Lola. \n\n\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this sweet girl and adding her to your family, please reach out to Kayla via email at 11kayla11@gmail.com with your name, location, and why you think Lola could be a good fit for you or your family! From there, I would love to set up a time for her to meet you (and any of your pets).",

I'm currently about 10 months old and 30 pounds. Having been out in the world I know it can be a big, scary place sometimes. Because of this, I usually look to my human companion for direction, confidence, and treats! I take great pleasure in seeing my handler happy and I'm eager to learn. The biggest next step is to get into a home and a routine to really solidify my potty training and start the understanding of house training. I'm looking for a patient, encouraging family to spend the rest of my life seeing their happy faces.

The person that found them kept her puppy, but Hadley had no plan. We came across a plea for help, and made arrangements to get her into our care thanks to our awesome fosters! Unfortunately, Hadley was heartworm positive and had to go through treatment before traveling to Wisconsin to search for her forever home.\n\nHadley is your typical Boxer. She is full of wiggles, has no concept of personal space, and thinks she is a lap dog. ? She is a petite girl, weighing in at around 40 pounds. She enjoys going for walks, and does great on leash. Hadley can co exist with other dogs, but would do best in a home as an only dog. She has been tested with children and would do best with older children. The fast movements and loud noises of young children make her a bit nervous. We don\u2019t know much about her story before she came to us, but our guess is she lived outside. She is working on crate and potty training. She has been doing great in her foster home and we are so excited for her to find her forever home. She will make a perfect companion",

            "description": "TONYA: Will be 12 weeks old on 1/28/20, 4lbs, Sharpie/Beagle Mix, Spayed Female, Estimated to Be About 35 to 40lbs Full Grown \n\n As we head into 2021 let's SHARPIE or SLAY? We're not sure it's going to catch on. But we are sure that these guys are stupidly cute! Please welcome our latest crew of wrinkly perfection. These guys are currently hanging in thier foster homes eating, sleeping, playing and growing. These guys were dumped at a shelter in TN at 6 weeks old. And are now nice and cozy in their NYC foster homes getting ready for thier big day (adoption day). These guys are going to be about 35 to 40lbs full grown. Their adopters need to be ready to take on puppy training and potty training. They will do well in an active home. They would be okay with respectful children 10 years and up and parents who are willing to navigate teething puppies and children :) These guys will need at least 90 minutes of outdoor time a day as adults. Interested in adopting please go to www.socialteesnyc.org or reach out to your point person if you are already approved. \n \n\nHer Foster Says: Tonyas blue eyes were the first thing I noticed about her. Then her cute little wrinkles around her nose. She enjoys spending her day napping and taking play breaks where she likes to chase her human or a dog friend around the room. She has a calm demeanor, especially for a puppy, and enjoys sitting on your lap and cuddling. Tonya learns fast and has almost mastered pee pads. Whoever adopts her is in for a real treat. She was the only girl in her litter and is a chunkster bigger than her brothers. I love her white socks and how she hops around like a rabbit when she plays lol. Oh and she looks like a baby pig with her pink belly up. \n\nWhat is a Beagle?: A beagle is in fact a type of hound and super scent oriented. They have a great sense of smell and superior tracking instincts. Fun fact, beagles are the primary breed used as detection dogs for prohibited agriculture. The breed's most famous representative is the world's very beloved cartoon character Snoopy! Beagles are very popular family dogs because they are known to be sweet and easy to train. (On a sad note, they are commonly used in testing labs because they are so trusting and docile, and there are many rescues specifically dedicated to saving beagles from the chemical testing world.) \n\nWhat does owning this dog entail?: Plenty of socialization, exercise, and mental stimulation is key for keeping this medium active pup happy. Generally you can expect to need to give this canine a minimum of 90 minutes of outdoor time every day. A perfect walking, hiking, and adventure buddy. We strongly recommend a basic training course to get a more solid feel for this pup's individual needs and how to best communicate with each other. Beagles often have some prey drive though, so adults can be quick to go for small animals like squirrels and may not be great choices for homes with small animals. They can be very stop and go walking buddies sometimes because of that crazy nose of theirs, so strolls take a while sometimes. They are also quick to take off if they catch a scent, so you have to be extra careful with beagles off leash because they will disappear if you haven't done enough recall training with them -- or even if you have sometimes, their instincts just take over. We strongly recommend not having them off leash in an unenclosed area.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This animal is not at the Social Tees office all of our dogs and cats are in foster homes while they wait to find their forever families. :) If youd like to apply to adopt this pet, please complete an adoption application at socialteesnyc.org. Because we are a small team and receive hundreds of applications each week, we are unable to respond to every application and every inquiry email, but we do our best. Please have patience! If your application is approved, you will for sure hear from us. If you have questions, please take a look at the Adoption and Fostering FAQs etc. on our website as all common questions are answered there. Thank you for your understanding and flexibility as we work to save these innocent lives!! \n\nLEARN MORE ABOUT US: socialteesnyc.org; Instagram via @socialteesnyc; Facebook.com/socialteesanimalrescue",

He's hoping someone will be willing to get him out of the shelter so that he can curl up in a cozy bed at night instead of on this cold, hard floor.\n\nWe have no back story or update for this dog at this time.

She was so scared and confused, she spent the majority of her time hiding and shaking. The shelter staff and volunteers fell in love with her sweet demeanor and knew that there was an amazing dog in there. They began working with her as often as possible and slowly but surely she began to come around. Now she is a bubbly and sweet medium sized princess. She became urgent and the idea of this girl being killed after everything she'd been though just broke everyone's heart so a final plea was put out and we agreed to take her. She arrives tomorrow and needs a foster home to arrive to where she can continue to blossom into the amazing she girl she has the potential to be. \n\nIf you feel that's with you please contact us immediately!\n\nTo Contact Us\n\nMessage us through our website http://www.highplainspaw.org\n\nMessage the Facebook Page at https://www.facebook.com/HighPlainsPAW\n\nFill out our Adoption Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/adoption-application\n\nFill out our Foster Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/foster-application\n\nEmail us at highplainspaw@gmail.com\n\nCall our VOICEMAIL at (402)957-1578\n\n $200.00 Adoption Fee \n\n(Which is considered a non refundable donation and being we are a 501c3 organization it is tax deductible.

            "description": "Sasha is a gorgeous 3yo husky mix who is a great size at 33lbs. She seems to be dog friendly with all sizes of dogs thus far. She does seem to be very human oriented and follows her foster mom or dad around. She enjoys watching and waiting for squirrels in the back yard. She does have a high prey drive for rabbits, birds, etc so 6 ft security fence and leash walks/hikes only for this girl. She is good in a crate and goes in regularly throughout the day if the door is open. She seems easy going in the house, quiet at the fence and window which is not necessarily husky-like. We do not know her past or whether she was allowed inside but she does need some help with asking out to potty. She is smart and may learn to ring a bell easily. We think Sasha would do best in a home where she will get ample time with her owner , walks/hikes/couch time. She is a husky - she sheds. Apply if you are cool with that \n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete an application at https://www.circle2rescue.com/dog-adoption-application/ The adoption fee of $250 includes the spay/neuter, vaccinations, deworming and microchip. \n\nPlease note, Circle 2 Rescue cannot guarantee the breed, composition or ages of our dogs as we usually have no history prior to them entering the rescue. We make every effort to ensure the dogs are healthy.",

PLEASE READ ENTIRE BIO BEFORE EMAILING****\n\n*Name: Yogi\n*Age: 1 year\n*Current Weight: 70\n*Rescued from: Texas\n*Adoption fee: $375 \n*Health: up to date on required vaccines\n\nJust look at that sweet face and you know this boy is full of personality.  Yogi is a fun loving dog but has to be re-homed, the apartment life is not for him.  So, apartment homes will not be considered for him.  This playful boy needs exercise so a fenced yard is needed for him.  (Acreage with an invisible fence may be considered.)   Yogi is great with other dogs so he would love a canine sister or brother.  Yogi is house trained and loves his toys.  If you have the perfect home for this fun loving, happy, playful boy, Yogi says he can't wait to meet you!  \n\nYogi was rescued from an area where there is an abundance of homeless dogs, and not a lot of shelter space for them to go while they wait for their forever homes. He will be arriving at SNARR's Adoption Center in Brewster, NY on February 15th ready for adoption! To apply to adopt Yogi, fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. \n**Meet and greets will not be scheduled without an approved application.**\n\nIMPORTANT:  For any dog or puppy that is not able to be spayed/neutered prior to adoption, SNARR requires a $125 deposit in addition to your adoption fee, as well as a strictly-enforced signed Spay/Neuter Contract stating you will have this dog altered within 6 months of adoption. The $125 deposit will be returned once the contract has been fulfilled. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n-------------------------------------------------------\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $375 for adults. Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n\n\n",

            "description": "Aki is a beautiful purebred female German Shepherd, almost 2 years old. She was rescued at the end of November weighing only 37 pounds. She is now at a healthier weight, approximately 43 pounds, and will be a medium sized dog. Vet confirmed ideal weight to be approximately 50 lbs.\n\nShe has a sweet, playful personality, but is also anxious, fearful and prefers a female owner. Aki can be skittish around men initially, but is learning to trust. She is mostly house and crate trained, with the occasional accident.\n\nShe is UTD on shots, not spayed as we were waiting for her to be healthy and strong enough for it. She needs to be in a home without small children; a fenced yard is required. She may do well with male dogs; we are not sure how she is with cats. She is learning to walk on a leash.\n\nAki is going to need someone who is calm and patient with her. She came from a bad situation.\n\nIf you're interested in adopting Aki, please fill out an application at aylasacres.org.\n\nThere is an adoption fee and a home visit is required.",

However, when she warms to you she will be your shadow! She loves playing with her foster siblings and is gentle with her feline siblings too. We think she is mixed with Boxer as well as the Black Mouth Cur. \n\nAt 40 pounds she is the perfect size for someone who wants a smaller dog that acts like a big dog. In photos she appears bigger but on the shorter side. \n\nShe has been learning how to walk on leash and is quickly catching on. She would do best with another dog or active kids, so that she is mentally and physically stimulated. Exercise is a must. \n\nAlthough she is mostly potty-trained (about 80%), she can be hesitant to go outside alone. You will have to be patient while she builds up her confidence with being outside on her own. She needs another dog in the home--another dog will help her learn the ropes. She is crate-trained and will even go into her crate on her own when she needs a break from her foster siblings. \n\nShe has quickly become one of our favorite fosters and we are so excited for her to get the loving stable home she deserves.",

She is good with other dogs of all sizes and is totally fine with cats as well. Lulu is house and crate trained and rides well in the car. She can be on the shy side when first meeting new people and dogs but she warms up quickly. She is great with kids and REALLY gravitates to them when she meets them.

He's a happy boy that loves to play and is doing great with training. He is NOT however good with cats He does still need to be neutered so he won't be available for about a month due to scheduling back ups at the vet and then him needing to heal.

She came out of an overcrowded dog home where she was one of seven dogs pulled by animal control.  She grew up with a child and really is suitable for anyone looking for someone to love  and give her what she deserves.  Her scruffy coat makes her that much more endearing,  her white paws lending to the name Twinkle Toes.  She'll strut about and run in circles until you pick her up.   She weighs 7 lbs and is full grown.   If interested in adopting her,  our process begins with the application which can be found on our website at www.adoptmebluegrasspetrescue.com",

She's an energetic girl with the zoomies to match and she would love a dedicated adopter who can help her get her energy out. She is a playful pup who loves to chase after toys and would love a yard to run around in or plenty of hiking adventures to take off on so she can sniff as much as her heart desires. Carly is a total smarty pants too - she already knows 'sit' and 'down' and can't wait to add more tricks to her resume. She loves treats and will make a great training buddy for anyone ready to work with her. She can be a little nervous at times and is looking to build her confidence with a patient, forever family to show her how fun and care-free life can be for her. Carly needs a home with no children under the age of 12 because she's still working on her manners and can be mouthy and uncomfortable with some handling. She's a sweet girl who's ready to settle into someone's lap for all the kisses and attention they can spare. If Carly sounds like the perfect match for you, adopt her today!\n\nIf you're interested in adopting Carly, please email a completed adoption application to adoptions@kitsap-humane.org. Adoption applications and more information about our adoption process can be found on our website here: https://www.kitsap-humane.org/adopt/how-to-adopt/. Once your application has been received, you will be placed in line to have your application reviewed. All applicants are pre-screened over the phone, and then are scheduled for a time to come in and meet the dog at the shelter.

He is great raw material looking for someone to love and teach him how to be a proper gentleman.  We have not yet assessed Roman with other dogs, but our initial observations are he may be best as an only pet.  We will update his profile when we know if he is dog friendly.  We think he is a bit much for little kids, so we recommend children over 10 years old.  We do not cat test.  \n\nFOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS TO BE CONSIDERED: \n\nTo adopt, complete the application at tarnj.org/adopt\n\nIf you have any questions at all, please DO NOT use the PetFinder inquiry form as we do not respond to those. Questions should be sent to info@tarnj.org. \n\nAn application is required before any meets are scheduled so the best way to be considered is to apply ASAP at tarnj.org/adopt.\n\nWe are all volunteer-run and do our best to respond to every application. If there is a match with your application, you should hear from us within 2-5 days. If you do not hear from us, please check your Junk folder or email us for an update.",

He is very chill and enjoys sitting or laying next to you, especially when you scratch him. He loves chewing bones and cuddling. He is gentle and does well with kids (mine are 5 and 2), other dogs, and cats. He pulls a little bit while on the leash, but he is working on that. He loves to sniff and use his nose on walks. He absolutely loves the snow and prancing around. Buddy is potty trained! He is eager to please his human! He is an easy going dog excited to find a family that will love him forever.

He needs to be kept calm with no aerobic exercise or increased stress. \nParker is a very high energy dog, so this would be a commitment his new owners will need to make.\nHe is a smart and curious dog and enjoys going on short leash walks. \nHe is also a huge fan of toys!\nParker has interacted with other dogs during his time at the shelter and he is playful. However, to his rough play style conflicting with the type of lifestyle he needs to live - another dog in the home may not be a healthy idea. \nAdditionally, he does get easily over-aroused and can be very jumpy - so we encourage a home without young/small children at this time.\n\n\nHe was previously in a foster home and this is what his foster Mom said about him:\nParker loves to play! He is a bit high energy, is always up for a good tummy rub, and also enjoys walking the neighborhood and exploring. Not sure if he would be suited for homes with kids since he is strong and can play a little rough or easily knock them over. He seems to be house trained. Loves snacks and dog toys.\n\nIf you think Parker might be a good fit, come meet him at Charleston Animal Society!\n",
