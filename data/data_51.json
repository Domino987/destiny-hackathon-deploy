Maggie loves playing with toys and hanging out with other doggy friends. She can be very vocal at times, but only because she always has lots to talk about!\n\nMaggie has a lot of energy and would love an active home where she can run around and get lots of exercise. She would love to play with other dog siblings in her new home. \n\nAdoption fee includes spay/neuter, vaccinations, worming, microchip, and a start on flea/tick prevention.\n\nFor more information, please call CBHS adoptions at 319-232-6887 or email at adoptioncounselor@yahoo.com.",

Of course it's that time of year where these cute beagles are found in the woods and not claimed, so we took her in. \n\nEve is 5 years old and a small girl at 23 pounds. She likes adults, kids and other dogs. She may not be good around cats. We are working on housebreaking and crate training, and she is doing good with both. \n\nEve is up to date on vaccinations, micro-chipped and spayed.  She did test low positive for heartworms so we have her started on Doxycycline and she is on heartworm preventive. \n\nEve will be a great dog for a family looking for a companion, or for a family looking for a friend for their dog, or an active retired couple who loves to walk. If you are interested in meeting her, our application can be found at www.homesfurhounds.com. She is located in Williamsburg, Va.",

            "description": "Meet Rebekah! She's a 3yo spayed Lab-mix. Rebekah just came to Wisconsin from Oklahoma so we're just getting to know her.  She is unbelievably sweet and gentle but quite shy. She would benefit greatly from another dog in the home for cues and to help build her confidence. Even though loud noises and sudden movements startle her she is still sweet as can be and follows her 4yo human foster sister everywhere. She is quickly learning that cuddles & pets are awesome and she gives the cutest little kisses. The resident cats don't phase her at all; she pays them no attention. I have to physically put her into the crate because she's not used to it but doesn't whine or cry once she's in it. No potty accidents so far!\n\nIf you would like to be considered as a potential adopter for one of our great dogs, please go to our website- www.luckymuttsrescue.org and submit an application. Our application process includes landlord approval and vet checks. Please make sure all of your information is current and accurate, including a valid email address and phone numbers. Inaccuracies and/or incomplete data will delay and/or cancel your application.  We strive to process all applications in a timely manner, but with the high volume of applications we are receiving, it is taking anywhere from 1-3 weeks.  You may be contacted via email if there are concerns or questions.  Once all of your information is reviewed and if your application is approved, you will be notified via email.  Submitting an application and receiving an approval does not guarantee you will be adopting the dog you applied for.  Once you move to the meet and greet process, you will be contacted by the foster family to further discuss the dog, and answer questions you may have, and if applicable, a meet and greet will be set up at our adoption center.   Meet and greets are only set up with approved applicants, and we require all members in the household to be present, as well as any current dogs in the home. \n\nCurrent Adoption Fees Are:\n$400+tax for puppies to 3 years old\n$350+tax for ages 4-7\n$250+tax for ages 8 and up\nBonded pairs vary\n\nThe adoption fee covers spay/neuter, up to date age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, general deworming, heartworm test, (if over 6  months) and a certified veterinary inspection. Please be aware, listed dog breeds are based on information provided and cannot be guaranteed.  Submitting an application for a particular dog does not guarantee that you will be the applicant chosen, we receive several applications for each dog. Our adopters are picked based on the needs of the dog, and the home we feel with best fit based on your responses to our application, vet information and landlord requirements.   Approved applicants not chosen for the dog you applied for, will be in active status for a period of six months.  We encourage you to watch Petfinder, Facebook and our website for upcoming dogs.  Should you see a dog that interests you, please send us a Facebook message or an email with your approval number.  Please be patient with us, as Lucky Mutts Rescue is run strictly by volunteers and many of us work full time jobs, have families and also foster dogs. Thank you for considering Lucky Mutts Rescue for your next furry family member!",

He suffered an injury due to neglect which caused permanent damage to his back legs. When we rescued him he was living in a home that was not equipped to help him with his disability. He was left in an ill-fitted wheelchair that actually caused more damage to his legs. Since he has been with us, he is going to hydrotherapy sessions, getting laser treatments weekly and he has even started to take several steps in a row on his daily walks. He is able to stand on his own and we think as he continues to get stronger he will be able to walk even further. He is about 5 years old, adores every person he meets and loves to cuddle. We would love to see him in a home where he can be the center of someone's world and finally receive the unconditional love he has been longing for. If you would like to meet Mason please call or email us so we can set up a time. \nBecause we require home checks and Masons ongoing medical needs a foster or adopter should be within 30 minutes of Santa Clarita, Ca. \n",

He loves going on walks around the neighbourhood and sniffing all the smells the world has to offer. he enjoys exploring and socialising with human strangers.He has big puppy energy for a man of his maturity and always shows excitement for walk time and toys. He is smart, knows basic commands, and has good leash manners. He will most likely be found napping on the comfiest spot in the house (yes, he will find it) and will greet you enthusiastically if you come to say hi. Beast is an excellent boy who wants to find his forever family! Anyone would be lucky to welcome this handsome man into their home.\n\nAll dogs will be altered, microchipped, and receive age-appropriate vaccines prior to adoption.

He's handsome and sweet, and will work for treats, so he's eager to learn new commands (he already knows \"sit\"). Dusty hit the trail for reasons known only to him and wound up at the shelter as a lost dog on Jan. 8; his family did not come to find him. He is about 2 years old and weighs 51 pounds. He is up-to-date on vaccinations, now neutered, heartworm tested negative and will be microchipped upon adoption. Come meet him in Run 835 using ID#626787.\n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information. Shelter hours are: Tues. - Sun. 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. by appointment only until further notice, CLOSED Mondays & Holidays.",

He wiggles his whole body when he sees a new person, puts his slender head in your hand, and stares lovingly at you with his big brown eyes. He has nothing but love to share! He likes hanging out with other dogs, big and small, but much prefers the company of his people. He will be your shadow who follows you everywhere you go.\n \nRazoo lived a tough life before being rescued. It was evident that he had been abused and bears a big white scar on his head as proof. He is so thankful to the people that worked with him to overcome some of his fears. He still gets nervous getting into cars and being out and about in the world. He is definitely a homebody! Razoo knows how to sit and shake. He is also kennel trained and potty trained. He is extremely treat motivated and will work for food or affection. \n\nRazoo is a 5-6 year old Greyhound/Doberman/Great Dane mix and weighs about 80lbs. He is being fostered in Fort Worth, TX through Fort Worth Abandoned Animal Alliance. \n\nSubmit your application here:\nhttps://form.jotform.com/81144515117146",

She can be shy sometimes but also enjoys hanging out in the living areas with her people. She is never too far away from her canine companions and would benefit from another calm dog in the home. She walks well on a leash and likes to explore outside. She enjoys running around in the yard from time to time, but always comes in to cuddle up in a cozy bed. She is a quiet girl that will win over your heart in an instant. Sunny looks forward to her bright future with an understanding and patient adopter who will love her for the rest of her life. \n\nSunny lived in a hoarding house for her whole life. For the last couple of years, the dogs lived alone and continued to reproduce resulting in a whopping 43 dogs residing in the home by themselves. She was rescued by Satterwhite Pets before coming to us! Sunny is an 8 year old 35lb mixed breed being fostered in Fort Worth, TX. \n\nSunny is heartworm positive. The cost of her treatment is paid for by the rescue. She has already started her treatment and will just need to go to her vet appointments in Fort Worth to complete it (three visits total).",

I need a family who will love me. I would love to live with another dog and a family who will help me build up the strength in my back legs... they are a little weak from not moving as much as I need too... That's ok! With that right family and some supplements I should be good to go! I am a lover, and super excited to be around people... I LOVE life! Kids who are experienced with big ole dogs or over 10 would be great because I don't realize how big I am. I love to play fetch and play and know manners. I am crate trained too! I know how to sit and stay and I can give a high five. I love to give kisses. Please apply to come meet me at www.eapl.com",

He is a sweet, 1 year-old boy who is a typical high-energy husky, and seeks love, attention, reassurance, and a stable, loving home.\n\nDue to unfortunate circumstances, Mando recently lost his family. He is timid at 1st but once he warms up he is confident and excited to go for hikes, walks, & play. He is house trained, good on a leash, somewhat crate trained, and great with children of all ages.\nMando appears to be a dominant male so may do better with another submissive male or a female.\n\nMando is looking for a husky savvy family or foster family who can continue positive training, daily exercise, stimulation, and good nutrition. Mando is micro chipped and up to date on vaccines and spayed.  His adoption fee is $400  Minimum adoption age is 25 and no apartments/ condos .",

Visit our FAQ webpage for commonly asked questions about our adoption/foster process.\nMy name is Deejay. I was living in a crate in a pole barn when my foster family met me. I'm very playful and very, very smart! I've learned lots of tricks already! I settle down nicely and love to cuddle. Im looking for a home with no kids or pets because I would love to be your one and only. I will be best with a fence so I can run. A rural area without the hustle bustle of city life would be wonderful. I am currently on meds for some anxiety and will need to work with an in person trainer when one is available.\n\nI am looking for an active home who can burn my energy. I know my forever home is out there. Could that be with you? If so, please fill out an online appication.\n\nLast Day Dog Rescue now microchips all animals before adoption. Microchips are implanted between the animals shoulder blades and are a permanent form of identification. The microchips are registered to Last Day Dog Rescue with the adopter's info added once adopted. If the animal is ever lost and slips his/her collar/tags the microchip allows the finder to know who to contact if scanned for a microchip. Animals MUST still have a collar with tags on at all times. Per our contract, we take all our animals back if for any reason you can't keep your adopted animal.\n\nPlease understand the statements about this animal are based upon the foster home's evaluation of the animal. The animal might behave differently (negatively or positively) in your home. While the animal might be good with the current foster's dogs, cats, children, etc., it may not be with your animal(s) or children. The animal may be housebroken or litter trained in the home of the foster but may relapse in your home. The animal is represented to the public as it performs in the foster home and any statements made regarding the animal are conditional to that foster home setting. Please understand that statements made regarding this animal are simply overviews and are not guaranteed.\n\nThe Petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our animals. Visual breed identification in animals is unreliable so for most of the animals we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each animal as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our animals based on personality, not by breed label.\n\nThank you for looking through our list of animals needing forever homes and choosing rescue first. We appreciate you stopping by.",

            "description": "Meet Lady! Behind those adorable eyes is a sad story to tell, but she's living in the moment and is a great pet! Lady came into rescue after her person passed away from cancer. He was an animal lover and when he passed there were seven living together - Prince, Lady, Daisy, Bo, Roscoe, Brutus, and Max. They are not bonded to one another but enjoy the company of other pets and so far, all have tested great with cats, (respectful) kids, and all adults. They appear housetrained, crate trained or crate tolerant, and enjoy some snuggles on or near your lap! Lady could use a dental procedure and prefers canned food over hard kibble, but she's been great in foster care and is a perfect pet. Because we are foster based, we require an approved application because a meet and greet can be scheduled. We think that is fair to our foster and the pet so every meet and greet has the potential to result in an immediate adoption! The application is available on the rescue website and can be completed online. We work with many rescues and strive to find every rescued dog in our care a great home. Sometimes that means transferring that pet to another location where adoption may be more likely. We currently have partners in New York, Pennsylvania, and Vermont.\n\nIf you are interesting in meeting any of our pets, the process is to complete an application. It can be downloaded as a pdf document from our website and submitted by email to WindyRidgeRescue@gmail.com as a scanned document or as photos OR can be completed entirely online. Both links are in the header of our website.\n\nBecause we are foster based, we require an approved application to schedule a meet and greet. We feel that is fair to our fosters and rescues so every meet and greet can result in an adoption.\n\nWe do not have set adoption fees for dogs, but hope adopters will donate generously so we can rescue more. The medical care for every dog can easily exceed the adoption donation. Average adoption fees for dogs in the area range from $175 up to $450.\n\nWe ask for a minimum adoption donation of $50 for cats regardless of age. Each cat is up to date on vaccinations, dewormer, and microchipped. Larger donations are always welcome so we can rescue more. Medical care for each cat easily exceeds the minimum donation.\n\nAs with every rescue, our resources are limited and the need for rescue help is unlimited. Your generosity helps us to rescue more.\n\nAdopting or fostering for a rescue frees up a space where a new rescue can reside.\n\nIf you can't adopt or foster, than please consider donating.",

            "description": "Meet Keyla! This sweet girl is only about 1 year old and looks to be a Shepherd mix. She has been around kids and other dogs and done well with both. Keyla loves going to Fiesta Island and is a social, friendly girl. She does like to chase kitties though so needs a home with no cats. Keyla is good on leash and is learning her basic commands. She loves to play with toys and get attention from her people. She knows how to use a dog door and is housetrained in her current foster home. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting Keyla, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org.

Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs. Thank you for rescuing.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue.

Doesn't matter where you try to hide them, he will find them and now it's a game of fetch. Moose loves to go berry picking and picking his very own berries to eat, When planning a movie night, make sure you have plenty of popcorn! Popcorn is his all-time favorite snack and he doesn't like to share. Moose is not the typical cuddly dog, he's more interested in patrolling and watching over you. Moose is not recommended for households with other pets or children under the age of 15.Adoption Application can be found at: https://service.sheltermanager.com/asmservice?account=hk0097&method=online_form_html&formid=13",

            "description": "Breed: Mastiff/Pit Bull mix\nSex: Female\nDOB: ~01/06/2013\nWeight: 68 lbs\nEnergy Level: Medium\nPersonality Type: Goofy, Sweet, Outgoing, Talkative\nHistory: Transferred from animal control\nGood With: Kids, Cats, Dogs\nIdeal Home: Just about any home! Apartments could be ok with an active family!\nFence Requirements: Not required.\nSpecial Info:\n\nThe information we are providing for this animal was developed based on observations and assessments in a shelter or foster environment. We do our best to provide information that will help determine if the dog might be a good fit for you. Please note that behaviors may change in a home environment. We also ask our applicants to assume that any animal they adopt from us will need to be potty trained and learn house manners, although this is not always the case. Our online animal bios are designed to provide as much information as possible and answer some anticipated questions. We do not have the resources to respond to emails with more specific questions.\n\nWe are receiving an unusually high number of applications per pet at this time! Please follow the rules below to ensure your application is reviewed; pay attention closely to these instructions because applications will NOT be processed if they are not followed. Please keep in mind that dog/cat availability is currently changing by the hour; you will receive an email if the animal you are interested in is no longer available. New dogs become available almost every day, so feel free to let us know if someone else interests you if your initial choice is already adopted! \n\nFill out the application (DOG: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IHD-DOG-Application-9-10-18.pdf, CAT: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IHD-CAT-Application.pdf) completely. Every question must be answered, and it must be signed. If you are going to type your responses, open the application, save it, type your answers, and save it again. \n\n-Applicants must be 21+ years old and live within a 50-mile radius of our shelter at 22415 Groesbeck Hwy, Warren 48089.\n\n-You must identify at least 1 dog/cat that you are interested in. If there are multiple dogs/cats, number them in order of priority. \n\n-Scan a copy of proof of home ownership (i.e. tax bill, deed, or mortgage payment - you can black out the account #, etc.) or animal clause/agreement of your rental agreement.\n\n-Attach the application and home ownership proof/rental agreement animal clause to a new email and send it to bark@iheartdogs.org. The subject line must be formatted to read \"\"#1 choice of dog/cat, Your First and Last Name\"\". Example: Subject: Fido, Jane Doe\nOnce your application is received, it will be assigned to an Adoption Counselor who will follow-up with the applicant who is the best fit within a few days, or to discuss other dogs/cats. It could take up to a couple of weeks for you to receive a final disposition on your application so there is no need to check on the status.\n\n-Introductions will be scheduled by appointment only, 45 minutes per appointment. The entire household, including current dogs, must be present for the appointment. The introductions will take place outside in our parking lot.\n\n-We will continue to perform vet checks for current and prior pets in the household.\n\n-Home visits will be in person for the yard and virtual for inside the home.\n\n-Finalizing the adoption will also be scheduled by appointment.\n\nWhile this process may seem cumbersome, it is interim during COVID-19, and it is designed to help us respond to the volume of emails we receive every day. Since we are receiving a high volume of applications, please be patient if a dog/cat is no longer available. \n\nThank you for your understanding.",

            "description": "Missy is a fiercely loyal girl who is very loving to her person once she has a chance to warm up and feel comfortable. She is a bulky cattle dog mix of sorts, weighing in at around 50#. Missy loves to follow her foster mom around the house and yard, making sure she's safe and close. Missy is good with other easy going dogs who respect boundaries and that generally mind their business. Missy is a simple, low-energy girl who requires only a safe and relaxing space to be her best self. \n\nMissy prefers a calm and consistent environment and would prefer a home with little to no traffic. A chaotic home with lots of activity or foot traffic makes her very uncomfortable and would not be a good fit. Missy is great in her crate and will require one in her adoptive home- this provides her a safe place to relax and feel secure. Missy is great about using the dog door to hang out in the yard but will need further training and time to master her leash skills. Missy would not do well in an apartment type setting and will require a fully fenced yard for her to do her business as she pleases. \n\nHer ideal home would be calm, consistent and secure. She would greatly benefit from a strong and confident handler that would give her the appropriate time to become comfortable and feel safe in her home, while providing some basic training, gentle exposure, positive reinforcement, and consistent structure. \n\nDo you have a calm and respectful home that Missy might fit in well with? She is a sweet and loyal girl who would love to give companionship to someone who can give her time to warm up and settle in. \n\nMissy is fixed, vaccinated and microchipped. Her adoption fee is $200. To be considered, please first apply online at caws.org. If you are interested in adopting a CAWS pet, please fill out an online application at https://caws.org/adoption-application",

She is a mature little 9 lb chihuahua mix of sorts, loves to lounge on the couch, in her bed (or yours) and to hang around at your feet, giving little gentle kisses at any opportunity! She gets along fine with the other easy going dogs and cats in her foster home. Dottie loves everyone she meets and quickly makes fast friends. \n\nShe loves to lounge, chew on bones and follow her people around, laying quietly at their feet. Dottie is crate trained and very much enjoys the retreat of her crate when unattended and to privately eat her twice daily, portioned meals. She would love to go for daily walks and is really great about staying close. She is also great about using the dog door in her foster home. Dottie is a respectful and quiet gal who rarely barks, only making silly sounds during feeding time.\n\nDottie is fixed, vaccinated, microchipped and healthy! . \n\nHer adoption fee is $100. To be considered, please start by applying online at caws.org. \n\nPlease note that we carefully select adoptive homes that best fit the needs of the animals in our care and not on a first come, first serve basis. Thanks! If you are interested in adopting a CAWS pet, please fill out an online application at https://caws.org/adoption-application",

She takes a few minutes to warm up to someone new, but then is a playful and active girl, She is looking for someone to help her work on her manners, general obedience and jumping behaviors. She has lived with both large and tiny dogs. Young kids are not recommended due to her size and exuberance. ----\nFor more information email mitliebegsdr@gmail.com or fill out an application on our website www.mlgsdr.com\n\n*Disclaimer, we're providing what information we know and what has been passed along by previous owners, shelters, etc. If the information you're looking for is not listed, please reach out and request more detail.\n\nAll dogs/puppies have been fully vetted including spay/neuter, micro-chipping, worming, heartworm testing, and preventative treatment, and all required age appropriate vaccinations. As required by Wisconsin Act 90, all dogs will have received a veterinarian exam (CVI) within the past 30 days, prior to finalizing the adoption. We reserve the right to not adopt to homes with children under the age of 7 years old. We also offer free beginner obedience classes (in Green Bay, WI) for any dog adopted from us.\n\nWe always recommend crate training, exercise, playtime and a regular schedule for potty breaks when bringing a new dog into your home. Adjustment takes time for both you and your new family member, so remember to be patient.\n\n\nMit Liebe German Shepherd Dog Rescue License #272376-DS",

Stubs is a friendly guy here at the Animal Shelter. He likes to be around people and get to interact with people. He is very strong though and is currently working on his leash manners. He does very well with both adults and kids here at the shelter when playing out in the yard. One thing to keep in mind is that Stubs doesn't get along with other dogs and cats, he is best suited for only dog home. He is looking for a forever home to call his own. Please contact the Shelby County Animal Shelter at 937-498-7201 to schedule an appointment to meet Stubs!",

They are both shy but super sweet and very motivated by human affection. \n\nSweet Pea is good with respectful children and good with other small dogs. She loves to be held and although shy gravitates to all the humans in the home. She has a bouncy happy personality. She's working on her house training skills and isn't familiar with walking on a leash but with some patience and one and one time she will get the hang of it. \n\nIf you're looking for an adorable bonded pair apply for these two today.

            "description": "Marlin would be quite the catch for anyone looking for a bundle of playful fun. This 4-year-old fella weighs just over 50 lbs and has a beautiful tri-colored coat of fawn, black and white. Energetic Marlin shows his excitement with zoomies and is receptive to training especially with a treat or two in your hand. Marlin has tested positive for heartworm but FAMD covers the cost of the treatment. This fella would fit best in a home with children over 8 years old. Give us a call; Marlin would love to meet you! Adoption questionnaires are processed in the order in which they're received. All of our dogs and puppies go home spayed/neutered, microchipped, heartworm tested (if at least 7 months old), and up to date on age-appropriate vaccinations. We do our best to update information on adoptable pets as frequently as we can. If you're interested in a specific pet, we recommend that you call the shelter and ask if he or she still is available.\nFor current adoption fees, please see our website, www.dearbornanimals.org. Adoption fee includes: age-appropriate vaccinations, spay or neuter, microchip, ID tag, fecal / worming, basic physical and behavior assessment. Dogs (6 months and older) receive an occult heartworm test. For an additional $20, cats (12 weeks and older) can be tested for FIV (feline immunodeficiency virus) / FLV (feline leukemia).",

            "description": "This energetic girl will have you dancing in the RAIN!\n\nHello guys! My name is Rain, but I am a dollop of sunshine! I am a 3 year old, female, spayed, Cattle dog-American bulldog mix. I am 65 lbs of love and a good girl at that! I am house trained and have learned to heel beautifully on leash with a Gentle Leader. The Animal Pad and my foster parents scooped me up from the Humane Society where I was brought in as a stray. They have been my guiding angels through tough times and I cannot wait to find my forever home!\n\nI am a really sweet girl, and live for my people with utmost loyalty and love! My foster parents say I have no concept of personal space. I mean, when I can sit on your lap and give you kisses, why not? I love our early morning cuddles and I'm happiest sleeping in bed with you! A good game of fetch or keep away always gets me going. And I LIVE for tug of war! I'll even bring you a toy and leave one side in your lap to grab. I'm a total smartie and pick up training so fast, I love the mental stimulation and making my people proud of me! I wag my tail like no tomorrow when praised for 'sitting' so well instead of barking! I have a whole bunch of energy, and I will always be up for some runs and hikes. I can get anxious if I am separated from my people, but my foster parents make me practice sleeping alone at night and I'm doing well with that. I may be rough on the edges, but a diamond shines the brightest after it's polished.\n\nI bond quickly and adore my people! I may be a big girl but inside I'm a big baby, and would love to have someone around to show me the ropes with structure and exercise. I get along well with my foster dog sibling and it took us about 2 days to get here. I struggled with reactivity for a while, getting overly excited and barking and lunging at new dogs or strange sights or noises. I've mostly kicked this bad habit, but I'll need my new family to continue to remind me to be calm when things are triggering around me. I am super playful with my new foster sis though, and play-wrestling is so fun! I don't mind sharing food, toys and treats too. Socialization to new situations is definitely helpful! About kids, my energy could be a bit much for them, but being around older teens who can play as well as guide me might be okay. I am not a huge fan of cats, and would rather not live with them.\n\nI would do best in an adult-only family, or with older teenagers, with a strong-leader like parent who can take me on fun, outdoor adventures and have amazing playdates in a yard. Since I'm super smart I'd like to keep busy with mental stimulation games and learn lots more tricks! My parent should have a confident personality, with experience working with big dogs who need an alpha. With proper introduction, I would enjoy living with another well-balanced, playful dog sibling. But it would also be fine for me to be the only pet in the home for a while, to get attention and time for obedience training and socialization. My adoption fee is $300 and that includes spaying/neutering, shots, and microchip. If you want to take me home, please fill out the form on the website here https://theanimalpad.org/adoption-application/",

You will not believe how far I\u2019ve come by just looking at my pictures so please read my description carefully. I was living in a yard with another doggie friend,  never allowed inside, until one day my owner decided he didn\u2019t want us in the yard either. So out on the streets we went! \nI was living on the streets for months, evading all the neighbors that tried catching me. I had never known a loving hand so I was very scared and shut down. Finally, a nice lady from this rescue was able to catch me, and that\u2019s when things really began to change. I was taken to the vet and they shaved off all my dirty mats. They said a am about 2 years old. I went to a home and realized how much I love cuddling on the couch with the other dogs and playing with them too! My favorite time of the day is feeding time, or anytime that involves food.  My foster mom tells me all the time how brave I am because I am still learning to trust people, and have made good strides in my foster home, but I am still VERY leery and scared of new people. I am crate trained and doing very well with my house training. I walk ok leash but I still need help with my confidence.  My world was a scary place, and I am working hard to put the past behind me. I need to live with other small dog(s) who are good natured and can continue to show me the ropes and maybe even like to play with me.  My perfect owner would be someone who has a quiet demeanor and lots of time and patience to help me continue healing my heart and gaining trust in the world around me. \nNoisy and/or busy households are too much for me to handle...and kids can be very scary for me too, so my new home should not have children. \nMy adoption fee is $450 which includes health examination, current vaccinations, neuter, microchip, flea and deworming treatment along with any other medical or dental deemed necessary by our veterinarian. \n",

            "description": "Cha Cha is ready to dance into your life! Can you bring this sweet, handsome boy home? He was adopted and kept outside without any training or love and his family returned him for being too energetic. He gets wound up at the shelter but even with the little time they can provide him for training, he does settle once he can focus on the commands he is given! He's a smart dog and seems to easily pick up commands and cues, he just needs a little more work and probably a more active household. He has done well with other dogs and after slow intros, a playmate might be a great fit for this boy so he can release some of that energy! He just keeps getting overlooked at his current shelter and all he wants this new year is to find his forever family. Can you help?",

A delightful little walker, she can be a nosey Rosy who delights in indulging her sniffer and is alert to her surroundings. When Ambrosia isn't being distracted by smells and sounds, she sticks to you like glue. She's a leaner who wants to be close to you and would love to curl up in your lap. Ambrosia loves to give kisses and is a chin nibbler. She sits for treats, which she loves, and has the most adorable ears that pop up on a diagonal like antennae when we squeak the toy. Ambrosia's adoption fee is $150 and helps cover the cost of her spay, vaccinations, worming, monthly heart worm, flea and tick preventive, microchip and care while at CCHS.",

He has been abused by men in the past so although sometimes he is very affectionate with some men, he does have trust issues so an easy going, gentle and affectionate , yet assertive home is required   He\u2019s not fond of young children so an adult only home is also required.  He also does not like other animals so he must be the only animal in the home.  He does fine on a leash when he sees other animals, as long as they keep their distance.  Instead of long walks, Harley would much go for a short walk and then run around the yard and play with his people.  He must have a securely fenced yard.  AN EXPERIENCED HOME WITH STRONG TEMPERED, DOMINANT  BREEDS IS REQUIRED",

She came to rescue from a municipal shelter where she & her 9 (yes, nine!) little pups had been brought as strays. Life as a rescue dog has rocked, but Starla is done being a mom & ready to find a new furever family of her very own.\n\nStarla is okay with most other dogs, but would request she be the only dog (if possible). She prefers her canine playmates active, but NOT bossy or otherwise likely to clash with Starla's status as \"Queen Bee\". People of all types are awesome, but if kids are in the picture.... older, school age humans are best (young kids might get accidentally knocked over). A family cat or small furry pet is likely to trigger her hunting hound side, so Starla is seeking a furever family without those please.\n\nStarla is crate trained, house-trained, & knows how to use a doggie door! Being a young VERY athletic girl, Starla will do best in an active home who has a securely fenced yard... or is willing to 110% commit to regular daily leash walking/running so she can work out all her happy wiggles. Bonus points if you have any stuffy toys or dental chews to share?\n\nIf you think Starla is the dog for you, please fill out an adoption application today!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSTARLA i\ns available for adoption through K-9 Rescue of the Eastern Shore.\n\nAn adoption process is required to include filling out an online adoption application available at the following link -- https://www.k9rescuees.org/info/adoption\n\nVeterinary and personal reference checks, and a home visit/meet-n-greet are required PRIOR to being approved to adopt. The time frame for completing this process depends largely on how quickly references respond, your vet office is able to speak to us (some want written permission first), your landlord or HOA (if applicable) confirms their approval for a pet, & how your schedule aligns with that of our volunteer(s) for the Home Visit\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nPLEASE NOTE ~ All of our rescue members are volunteers with many obligations. While we may not be capable of immediate response, we will respond to all inquiries and application submissions as soon as possible. Thank you for thinking adoption! 1/31/21 7:31 PM",

I want to thank all who helped get me back to my foster home ? I\u2019m a two year old, male retriever/terrier mix looking for his forever home. I\u2019m currently around 75 pounds, but will add more to be at an ideal weight. Before I came to Purple PAWS, I was found drowning in a pool by animal control in Oklahoma- hence the name. I\u2019m learning to be loved, and growing more comfortable everyday. I am crate trained, haven\u2019t had a potty accident since the first day, and I am dog friendly. I will need some patience as I continue to learn the basics on \u201chow to dog.\u201d I can scale a 6ft fence, but my foster mom thinks once I\u2019m comfortable- I won\u2019t want to stray from home. Before adoption, I will be fixed, fully vaccinated and tested for heartworms.",

She plays well with other dogs and is very affectionate. \nSky would make a great companion dog for an active home. She would enjoy a life of adventure and join her new best friend in world exploration. Another buddy dog of her energy to play with is a plus. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nIf interested in Sky please reply with detailed info about the adoptive family or submit an adoption interest application below.,\nTax deductible adoption fee applies. \nhttps://www.kingofheartsfoundation.org/adoption-application.html\n\nVideo link of Sky:\nhttps://youtu.be/6V5w7jKgXbM\n",

She is around 8 months old and 40lbs.\n\nFrida is a playful energetic young puppy, she was part of an accidental litter in home with a black labrador and a boxer, they are the 2 dogs featured in the short clip. Fortunately, her mum has now been spayed and it won\u2019t happen again. Frida does very well around dogs of all sizes and humans of all sizes, she is very interested in human affection. Frida will arrive from Oklahoma.\n\nFrida is vaccinated, microchipped and her spay procedure will be included in her adoption fee.\n\nFrida knows just how miraculous a turn her life has taken when she was picked out by Havok\u2019s Wolfpack and she is determined to live her new life to the fullest in the most playful and adventurous way, hopefully, with you.\n\nHer adoption fee is $350.\n\nIf you are interested in Frida, please submit an adoption application here:\nwww.havokswolfpack.com/adopt",

Please read the entire post below on how to apply, and before calling or emailing!**\n\nPiggy is an adorable 12-week old Pit Bull Terrier mix. She is super sweet, friendly and playful. Piggy was dumped at a local vet\u2019s office where they suspected she had possibly ingested drugs. Thankfully after some oxygen and TLC she checked out just fine. Piggy does enjoy playing with other dogs, big or small. She loves her people and prefers to sleep in bed with them. A fenced yard is required for adoption. Piggy has been vet checked, vaccinated and dewormed. ADOPTION FEE $275, $50 of which is returned to you after you have her spayed, which is required by six months of age.\n\n***DUE TO COVID, WE ARE OPEN BY APPOINTMENT ONLY. NO WALK-INS WILL BE ACCEPTED!\n\nIN ORDER TO ADOPT, \nYOU MUST HAVE AN APPROVED APPLICATION PRIOR TO COMING IN TO MEET AND SPEND TIME WITH A PET. OUR ONLINE APPLICATION CAN BE FOUND ON OUR WEBSITE: WWW.ANIMALWELFARESOCIETY.NET. ONCE APPROVED, WE WILL CONTACT YOU TO SET UP AN APPT. UNFORTUNATELY, WE CANNOT CONTACT EVERY APPLICANT, AS WE SOMETIMES RECEIVE OVER 100 APPS FOR ONE PET!\n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR UNDERSTANDING AND COOPERATION.***\n",

            "description": "Piyo initially came to animal control as a stray that was never reclaimed.  He weighs about 9 pounds and is estimated to be 3-4 years old.  Once we had him home, we noticed that Piyo held up his left rear leg occasionally when he runs.  The vet determined after x-rays that his hip was probably injured when he was very young and was never treated.  He does very well with a inexpensive daily medication that is chewable and he takes it as a treat after breakfast.   It is possible that he may need hip surgery some day in his future if the medication is not enough to ease his pain.\n\nPiyo is such a sweet little man with a very shiny, soft coat that is non-shedding.  He's shy at first and will take a while to feel safe.  He may well have been passed around and is just not sure of his place and what is going to happen.\n\nHe's completely housebroken and may have had a doggie door.  He's been trustworthy in the house but if food is involved, he is on high alert.  He loves to play tag and wrestle with the other dogs his size.  He will entertain himself with his bone or a toy.  Piyo is a champion snuggler and will charge up onto the bed and dive under the covers.  So, guess what, he's been sleeping in my bed.  He snuggles as close as he can and doesn't move all night.  My feet have been very happy!\n\nThis boy is such a happy and gentle soul who just wants to be with his person.  He does bark, however, at noises and strangers outside so no apartments or condos for him.\n\nPiyo has been neutered, vaccinated, microchipped and tested for heartworms.  His adoption fee is $300.00.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Piyo, please write us at PricelessPoochRescue@gmail.com and ask for an application to adopt.  We are a foster-home based organization, and Piyo is in a foster home in Atlanta.  The adoption process starts when you submit your application.  Once that has been approved, we will contact you to schedule a time for you to meet us.",

            "description": "Think outside the lines\nGiggle til you weep\nPuppies are the greatest fun\nAnd cuddle in their sleep!\n\nIt\u2019s not all straight and narrow\nLots of wiggle waggle \nPuppies do it different\nLike children\u2019s Scribble Scrabble. \n\nMeet Tulip!  She is one of 11 puppies born to Aspen. She was born in foster care and has been loved and well cared for from the moment she entered this world. Her Mommy and Daddy were both strays that were found together in Millington, TN. She is a typical puppy!  Playful, bouncy, energetic, curious, always starving, and quite simply adorable. She loves attention, playing with toys, and loves meeting new people. The toy basket, hugs and treats are the favs with this litter. She is working on crate training and housebreaking.  She is learning how to walk on a leash, but with all puppies, will need continued training, consistency, patience and lots and lots of love.  The weather has been really cold for a young puppy to be outside often for leash training and we are extremely careful to not expose young puppies to unsafe areas until they are fully vaccinated. She plays well with other dogs, but has not been formally cat tested. She is a bit excitable about the kitties, so we have just been able to do fence greetings at this time.  Puppies require a lot of time, training and effort, so please only apply if you have all of that and lots of love to give. We will not adopt if you are not home or have someone lined up to let her out and spend time with her while you are at work. \n\nIf this pup sparks your interest, Then jump in line and apply!  Our app is on the home page, This puppy is gonna fly!\n\nANIMAL INFORMATION:  \nName:   Tulip\nBreed:  Black Mouth Cur mix\nGender:  Female\nAge:  almost 3 months\nWeight: 12 lbs           \nSpayed/Neutered: Will be 1/22/2021\nVaccines: Current\nHeartworm:  Too Young, currently on Heartgard\nMicrochipped: Yes\n\nFOSTER EVALUATION AND RECOMMENDATION:\nDogs:  Yes, fostering with other dogs of various sizes, genders and breeds\nCats:   Yes. She has met cats, but will need a slow meet and greet since she is puppy excitable. Recommend proper intro and supervision. \nOther Small Animals:  Unknown\nChildren:  Yes, she has met middle age children and has done well. She has not been tested with infants or toddlers. She is excitable and bouncy at times, and could potentially knock a little one down or get under feet.\n\nADOPTION INFORMATION:\nWe are a foster-based animal rescue and we thank you for your interest in one of our animals. Our fosters and adoption coordinators are the backbone of what we do. Our fosters work tirelessly to integrate our rescue animals into their home, so that we can provide as much information to potential adopters as possible. In addition, our coordinators offer as much information regarding the medical and behavioral and personality characteristics as is known to our organization. Without them, and our extremely generous donors, we would not be able to save as many animals as we do every day. With each adoption, we operate a Pay It Forward program, whenever possible, to help other animals in our rescue and future animals in need. \n\nIf you are interested in one of our animals, please complete an application. The application link can be found on our Petfinder homepage under the picture. You may also find our application on our website at www.petmatchmakerrescue.com under the Adopt page. If they are listed on our website, their adoptions have not been finalized yet. That does not mean that we have not received several applications, already. Please complete an application if you are interested and we will keep you apprised of their current status. We are all volunteers that work full-time jobs, so please be patient with us. We will get back with you as quickly as possible.  \n\nIf you are interested in fostering for our organization, please complete an application.  The application link can be found on our Petfinder homepage under the picture.",

Thankfully she went to a shelter where she could get the care she needed, and nobody showed up to save her. She is so thankful for the care she is receiving and she is just a lovely dog. Her past of neglect is behind her and she is ready for a home that will take appropriate care of her. Her hair continues to grow back in with good nutrition and medications, but it may not be perfect by the time she arrives. We do know she is good with other dogs and interested but not mean about kitties. She has been great with all the people at the shelter. She is Heartworm positive and has started the pre-medication prior to the injections to kill the worms. This treatment is covered by the rescue at our vets. She arrives to Minnesota on 2/6 and is looking for an adopter to step up and take her that day to begin the 2 week trial to make sure she is a good match.\n\nJada was positive for heartworm disease and will be treated by our vets after she arrives. More information on heartworm and treatment can be found here: http://headinghomek9rescue.com/Heartworm.pdf\n\nRequirements: Home with yard space.\n\nAdoption Fee: $450 + tax. This includes neuter/spay, current vaccinations as age appropriate, heartworm/tick testing if appropriate, deworming, microchip, and current preventatives\n\nInterested in adopting?  Fill out a preadopt application here: https://form.jotform.com/203104997748162\n\nYou can email fostersheadinghomek9@gmail.com with additional questions.\n\nThis dog is located in Minneapolis, MN\n\n",

He needs to have all of his puppy vaccinations and be neutered before he can be adopted. \nScout loves everyone, and snuggles are his favorite thing! He enjoys playing with his furry foster brother and loves his human foster siblings too. Scout is an extremely sweet little boy. If you'd like to consider fostering him until he's ready to be adopted and can join your family for good, please submit an adoption application.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION: www.tinyurl.com/IADRAdoptionApp\n\nIf you'd like to help Scout while he searches for his very own family, you can sponsor him for only $19/month here: https://petbucks.org/pet/6219/sponsor/create\n\n\n***IMPORTANT- PLEASE READ***\nThe State of Texas requires rescues to collect sales tax on any adoption fees. Our adoption fee is $175. Texas State Sales Tax will be added to that amount.\n\nDue to the nature of our adoption process, our fosters are usually only able to consider forever families within a reasonable driving distance of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. A vet reference is required, and a trial period will be completed before finalizing the adoption. Thank you for your understanding.",

He has been through training classes but needs a little brushing up. He does great on walks and car rides. He is well mannered in a home but used to being kenneled when his people are gone. He was surrendered due to no fault of his own. He is a great dog but does have a few faults. He also must be the only pet in the home and also have a privacy fence.

He is around 4yrs old (Est. DOB: 12/4/16) & is 86lbs. He has put on needed-weight since coming to Misfits, & could stand to fill out even more (his ideal/end weight will likely be between 90-100lbs). Wayne was pulled from Saginaw County Animal Care & Control, after just completing heartworm treatment. \n*He definitely did not know how to \u201cdog\u201d at first\u2026 but now, he is a total delight! He LOVES his people, & loves being near them. He has learned manners & does a great job at coming when called, sitting, waiting when asked, & does not jump up (which for his size, is much appreciated.) He is working on his leash manners, & is housebroken/crate trained. Wayne now loves the Idea of going buh-bye\u2026but still has reservations about climbing into some vehicles. Once he is in there though, he\u2019s a smiley happy fella! \n*Wayne would love if his people were home more often than not\u2026someone that works a 7-8 hour+ day will not work for this big guy. He has decided that 4-6 hours is the max that he wants to be without someone, & the max amount of time without going outside/potty. \n*Due to his size & the fact that he has a new lease on life, we recommend a home with older children (12yrs old+), as well as no cats or small dogs (under 20lbs.) Wayne has been good with medium to large sized dogs, & is working on his socialization with them daily. He has been around a small dog with no issue, but due to his happy-feet & size, he could unintentionally hurt a little dog. His ideal doggy companion (if he must have one) would be mostly calm, & probably 5yrs old+. He does well running around & romping with dogs, but things are still new & acclimating to a home with a current dog will take patience & time to ensure it goes as smooth as possible. \n*Wayne is neutered, current on vaccinations, microchipped, Heartworm negative & current on monthly preventions. He is big-headed, adorable gentleman that would love a forever home to call his own!\nADOPTION APPLICATION:  WWW.MISFITANGELSRESCUE.ORG",

Faun will climb chain link so she's going to need a solid, 6' wooden fence to keep her safe.\nShe is affectionate and smart, loves kids and is good with other dogs. We are going to recommend 'no cats' for this gal, she's a bit rowdy. She's perfect for an active family - and would excel in obedience class. She is very sociable and loves being with others.All of our dogs are available for a $200 donation. This includes them being spayed/neutered, micro-chipped, and fully vaccinated.\nTo adopt a dog, we require an approved pre-application, as well as a securely fenced yard. This means an actual, physical, fence. 'Invisible' fences are not acceptable, sorry. If you live in an apartment and do not have a yard, we are not able to adopt to you.\nPlease contact us at: dogtownmutts@gmail.com for details.\nPlease note: we typically do not do 'out of the area' adoptions. This would be any location more than 60 miles away from the Reno/Carson City area.",

            "description": "Think outside the lines\nGiggle til you weep\nPuppies are the greatest fun\nAnd cuddle in their sleep!\n\nIt\u2019s not all straight and narrow\nLots of wiggle waggle \nPuppies do it different\nLike children\u2019s Scribble Scrabble. \n\nMeet Spruce!  He is one of 11 puppies born to Aspen. He was born in foster care and has been loved and well cared for from the moment he entered this world. His Mommy and Daddy were both strays that were found together in Millington, TN. He is a typical puppy!  Playful, bouncy, energetic, curious, always starving, and quite simply adorable. He loves attention, playing with toys, and loves meeting new people. The toy basket, hugs and treats are the favs with this litter. He is working on crate training and housebreaking.  He is learning how to walk on a leash, but with all puppies, will need continued training, consistency, patience and lots and lots of love.  The weather has been really cold for a young puppy to be outside often for leash training and we are extremely careful to not expose young puppies to unsafe areas until they are fully vaccinated. He plays well with other dogs, but has not been formally cat tested. He is a bit excitable about the kitties, so we have just been able to do fence greetings at this time.  Puppies require a lot of time, training and effort, so please only apply if you have all of that and lots of love to give. We will not adopt if you are not home or have someone lined up to let him out and spend time with him while you are at work. \n\nIf this pup sparks your interest, Then jump in line and apply!  Our app is on the home page, This puppy is gonna fly!\n\nANIMAL INFORMATION:  \nName:   Spruce\nBreed:  Black Mouth Cur mix\nGender:  Male\nAge:  almost 3 months\nWeight: 12 lbs           \nSpayed/Neutered: Will be 1/21/2021\nVaccines: Current\nHeartworm:  Too Young, currently on Heartgard\nMicrochipped: Yes\n\nFOSTER EVALUATION AND RECOMMENDATION:\nDogs:  Yes, fostering with other dogs of various sizes, genders and breeds\nCats:   Yes. He has met cats, but will need a slow meet and greet since he is puppy excitable. Recommend proper intro and supervision. \nOther Small Animals:  Unknown\nChildren:  Yes, he has met middle age children and has done well. He has not been tested with infants or toddlers. He is excitable and bouncy at times, and could potentially knock a little one down or get under feet.\n\nADOPTION INFORMATION:\nWe are a foster-based animal rescue and we thank you for your interest in one of our animals. Our fosters and adoption coordinators are the backbone of what we do. Our fosters work tirelessly to integrate our rescue animals into their home, so that we can provide as much information to potential adopters as possible. In addition, our coordinators offer as much information regarding the medical and behavioral and personality characteristics as is known to our organization. Without them, and our extremely generous donors, we would not be able to save as many animals as we do every day. With each adoption, we operate a Pay It Forward program, whenever possible, to help other animals in our rescue and future animals in need. \n\nIf you are interested in one of our animals, please complete an application. The application link can be found on our Petfinder homepage under the picture. You may also find our application on our website at www.petmatchmakerrescue.com under the Adopt page. If they are listed on our website, their adoptions have not been finalized yet. That does not mean that we have not received several applications, already. Please complete an application if you are interested and we will keep you apprised of their current status. We are all volunteers that work full-time jobs, so please be patient with us. We will get back with you as quickly as possible.  \n\nIf you are interested in fostering for our organization, please complete an application.  The application link can be found on our Petfinder homepage under the picture.",

He is one of 11 puppies born to Aspen. He was born in foster care and has been loved and well cared for from the moment he entered this world. His Mommy and Daddy were both strays that were found together in Millington, TN. He is a typical puppy!  Playful, bouncy, energetic, curious, always starving, and quite simply adorable. He loves attention, playing with toys, and loves meeting new people. The toy basket, hugs and treats are the favs with this litter. He is working on crate training and housebreaking.  He is learning how to walk on a leash, but with all puppies, will need continued training, consistency, patience and lots and lots of love.  The weather has been really cold for a young puppy to be outside often for leash training and we are extremely careful to not expose young puppies to unsafe areas until they are fully vaccinated. He plays well with other dogs, but has not been formally cat tested. He is a bit excitable about the kitties, so we have just been able to do fence greetings at this time.  Puppies require a lot of time, training and effort, so please only apply if you have all of that and lots of love to give. We will not adopt if you are not home or have someone lined up to let him out and spend time with him while you are at work. \n\nIf this pup sparks your interest, Then jump in line and apply!  Our app is on the home page, This puppy is gonna fly!\n\nANIMAL INFORMATION:  \nName:   Alder\nBreed:  Black Mouth Cur mix\nGender:  Male\nAge:  almost 3 months\nWeight: 12 lbs           \nSpayed/Neutered: Will be 1/22/2021\nVaccines: Current\nHeartworm:  Too Young, currently on Heartgard\nMicrochipped: Yes\n\nFOSTER EVALUATION AND RECOMMENDATION:\nDogs:  Yes, fostering with other dogs of various sizes, genders and breeds\nCats:   Yes. He has met cats, but will need a slow meet and greet since he is puppy excitable. Recommend proper intro and supervision. \nOther Small Animals:  Unknown\nChildren:  Yes, he has met middle age children and has done well. He has not been tested with infants or toddlers. He is excitable and bouncy at times, and could potentially knock a little one down or get under feet.\n\nADOPTION INFORMATION:\nWe are a foster-based animal rescue and we thank you for your interest in one of our animals. Our fosters and adoption coordinators are the backbone of what we do. Our fosters work tirelessly to integrate our rescue animals into their home, so that we can provide as much information to potential adopters as possible. In addition, our coordinators offer as much information regarding the medical and behavioral and personality characteristics as is known to our organization. Without them, and our extremely generous donors, we would not be able to save as many animals as we do every day. With each adoption, we operate a Pay It Forward program, whenever possible, to help other animals in our rescue and future animals in need. \n\nIf you are interested in one of our animals, please complete an application. The application link can be found on our Petfinder homepage under the picture. You may also find our application on our website at www.petmatchmakerrescue.com under the Adopt page.

            "description": "Roscoe is so chill! He has such a sad story to share, but he's living in the moment and is a great pet! He has been crated without issue during the workday and is very sweet and attentive when you are home. He walks great on a leash or listens well even off leash. He was in a foster home with an 8 year old and 1 year old and did well. He came into rescue after his person passed away from cancer. He was an animal lover and when he passed there were seven living together - Prince, Lady, Daisy, Bo, Roscoe, Brutus, and Max. They are not bonded to one another but enjoy the company of other pets and so far, all have tested great with cats, (respectful) kids, and all adults. They appear housetrained, crate trained or crate tolerant, and enjoy some snuggles on or near your lap! Roscoe did test positive for heartworm disease, but the rescue will provide items to complete treatment. Because we are foster based, we require an approved application because a meet and greet can be scheduled. We think that is fair to our foster and the pet so every meet and greet has the potential to result in an immediate adoption! The application is available on the rescue website and can be completed online. We work with many rescues and strive to find every rescued dog in our care a great home. Sometimes that means transferring that pet to another location where adoption may be more likely. We currently have partners in New York, Pennsylvania, and Vermont.\n\nIf you are interesting in meeting any of our pets, the process is to complete an application. It can be downloaded as a pdf document from our website and submitted by email to WindyRidgeRescue@gmail.com as a scanned document or as photos OR can be completed entirely online. Both links are in the header of our website.\n\nBecause we are foster based, we require an approved application to schedule a meet and greet. We feel that is fair to our fosters and rescues so every meet and greet can result in an adoption.\n\nWe do not have set adoption fees for dogs, but hope adopters will donate generously so we can rescue more. The medical care for every dog can easily exceed the adoption donation. Average adoption fees for dogs in the area range from $175 up to $450.\n\nWe ask for a minimum adoption donation of $50 for cats regardless of age. Each cat is up to date on vaccinations, dewormer, and microchipped. Larger donations are always welcome so we can rescue more. Medical care for each cat easily exceeds the minimum donation.\n\nAs with every rescue, our resources are limited and the need for rescue help is unlimited. Your generosity helps us to rescue more.\n\nAdopting or fostering for a rescue frees up a space where a new rescue can reside.\n\nIf you can't adopt or foster, than please consider donating.",

She was seen frantically searching for her pups, even approaching moving cars just see if they might be inside, but she could not find them. They no doubt were still with\nLumi\n's \"owners\" waiting unknowingly to be sold. This is what happens in our city far too often!\n\nLumi\nis only about a year to year and half old, bred at her first heat cycle then discarded like garbage.\n\nShe is surprisingly heartworm negative, now vaccinated and will be spayed as soon as she is healed enough to undergo surgery. She so deserves a home where she will be loved and cared for, and taught how to be the wonderful girl she wants to be. She is very smart and learns quickly. She also gets along with other dogs! She so wants a human to be happy with her.\n\nIf you are interested in fostering or adopting our adorable girl, please complete the appropriate application at\nwww.scoutshonor.org",

They are sweet rambunctious young pups who we would love to see stay together. These dogs will need a fenced yard.  They do not like meeting other dogs when leashed and will bark and act ferocious.  Because they are still puppies, they need obedience training.  They have will chew on your arms when you pet them, so absolutely no children under the age of 10.\n\nAlcovy dogs are spayed/neutered, up to date on all vaccines, up to date on heart-worm preventative and flea preventative and micro-chipped.  Required registration of microchip in owner's name is $10.99.\n\nIf interested in adoption, please complete an online application on Alcovy Pet Rescue's website at www.alcovypet.com.  You must have a vet reference to adopt.  We verify the care of past/current pets.  Applications without a vet reference will not be approved for adoption.

He is one of 11 puppies born to Aspen. He was born in foster care and has been loved and well cared for from the moment he entered this world. His Mommy and Daddy were both strays that were found together in Millington, TN. He is a typical puppy!  Playful, bouncy, energetic, curious, always starving, and quite simply adorable. He loves attention, playing with toys, and loves meeting new people. The toy basket, hugs and treats are the favs with this litter. He is working on crate training and housebreaking.  He is learning how to walk on a leash, but with all puppies, will need continued training, consistency, patience and lots and lots of love.  The weather has been really cold for a young puppy to be outside often for leash training and we are extremely careful to not expose young puppies to unsafe areas until they are fully vaccinated. He plays well with other dogs, but has not been formally cat tested. He is a bit excitable about the kitties, so we have just been able to do fence greetings at this time.  Puppies require a lot of time, training and effort, so please only apply if you have all of that and lots of love to give. We will not adopt if you are not home or have someone lined up to let him out and spend time with him while you are at work. \n\nIf this pup sparks your interest, Then jump in line and apply!  Our app is on the home page, This puppy is gonna fly!\n\nANIMAL INFORMATION:  \nName:   Balsam\nBreed:  Black Mouth Cur mix\nGender:  Male\nAge:  almost 3 months\nWeight: 12 lbs           \nSpayed/Neutered: Will be 1/21/2021\nVaccines: Current\nHeartworm:  Too Young, currently on Heartgard\nMicrochipped: Yes\n\nFOSTER EVALUATION AND RECOMMENDATION:\nDogs:  Yes, fostering with other dogs of various sizes, genders and breeds\nCats:   Yes. He has met cats, but will need a slow meet and greet since he is puppy excitable. Recommend proper intro and supervision. \nOther Small Animals:  Unknown\nChildren:  Yes, he has met middle age children and has done well. He has not been tested with infants or toddlers. He is excitable and bouncy at times, and could potentially knock a little one down or get under feet.\n\nADOPTION INFORMATION:\nWe are a foster-based animal rescue and we thank you for your interest in one of our animals. Our fosters and adoption coordinators are the backbone of what we do. Our fosters work tirelessly to integrate our rescue animals into their home, so that we can provide as much information to potential adopters as possible. In addition, our coordinators offer as much information regarding the medical and behavioral and personality characteristics as is known to our organization. Without them, and our extremely generous donors, we would not be able to save as many animals as we do every day. With each adoption, we operate a Pay It Forward program, whenever possible, to help other animals in our rescue and future animals in need. \n\nIf you are interested in one of our animals, please complete an application. The application link can be found on our Petfinder homepage under the picture. You may also find our application on our website at www.petmatchmakerrescue.com under the Adopt page. If they are listed on our website, their adoptions have not been finalized yet. That does not mean that we have not received several applications, already. Please complete an application if you are interested and we will keep you apprised of their current status. We are all volunteers that work full-time jobs, so please be patient with us. We will get back with you as quickly as possible.  \n\nIf you are interested in fostering for our organization, please complete an application.  The application link can be found on our Petfinder homepage under the picture.",

They are sweet rambunctious young pups who we would love to see stay together. These dogs will need a fenced yard.  They do not like meeting other dogs when leashed and will bark and act ferocious.  Because they are still puppies, they need obedience training.  They will chew on your arms when you pet them, so absolutely no children under the age of 10.\n\n\nAlcovy dogs are spayed/neutered, up to date on all vaccines, up to date on heart-worm preventative and flea preventative and micro-chipped.\nIf interested in adoption, please complete an online application on Alcovy Pet Rescue's website at www.alcovypet.com. You must have a vet reference to adopt. We verify the care of past/current pets. Applications without a vet reference will not be approved for adoption. Our goal is to have the very best home for all our dogs and cats and therefore we reserve the right to approve or deny an application based on what we determine is in the pet's best Interest.  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n",

Too much prey drive.\n\nHe's still learning to be comfortable with new people but has no aggression at all. A home without children is best. \n\nPulls a bit when on the leash since he loves walks but can definitely learn!\n\nLoves car rides and will put his nose out the window if allowed. Waits in the car nicely for brief periods when foster mom is running errands.\n\nCommands known: \"wipe your paws', \"unhook\" (from harness), working on \"come/come on\"\n\nLikes: shoes, socks, slippers, paper, plush toys, squeaky and crinkle toys, rubber treat dispenser toys, chasing balls, nylabones, does enjoy pets and will lay next to foster mom when watching tv.  Could be a frisbee dog candidate.\n\nDislikes: garbage cans, messy yards, trash bags or any pile on the curb, driveways full of vehicles, and pick-up trucks.  He was rescued from a ghetto area after fending for himself on the street so Lyle is looking forward to living in a nice neighborhood. Who can blame him!\n\nThe best home for Lyle would be with a female owner who is a runner/outdoors and has a dog that needs a playmate. He will also thrive in a peaceful home environment. He needs a caring patient Mom and dog sibling who will help him blossom into a confident well socialized doggie. Lyle can be happy walking the same route every day but also does well venturing out to new greenbelts and nature areas. He needs a lot of patience with men as clearly they were not kind to him in his first months of life. Male dog whisperers can help doggies like Lyle learn to trust. Hopefully his forever Mom has a few around who are especially good with doggies.\n\nLyle has a beautiful prance when he's happy and its such a sight to see. He also really loves the snow! He loves running and has a look of sheer joy on his face when he runs. And he's a stunning pup who gets lots of compliments when he's out and about. \n\nHe is neutered, microchipped, up to date on vaccines including rabies, heartworm negative and current on prevention.\n\nThere will be transport fees (varies upon arrangements made per discussion) in addition to the $300 adoption fee.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Lyle, please complete an adoption application on https://www.westernaustralianshepherdrescue.com/.",

This lovable pair are happy-go-lucky, loving every minute of life despite what they have been through for the past year. They had a happy homelife until their person passed away and they found themselves in a loveless home, spending day after day in a small room with nothing to do, no windows to look out and no human companionship. Ralph loves squeaky toys, blankets, rugs to roll all over and treats. Misty loves to lounge around, snuggle with people and blankets. Both love people and are friendly with everyone they meet. They walk well on leash and enjoy running free in our large play yard. Although they don't mind spending some time alone, they are bonded and we often see them snuggling in the same crate. We are told that Ralph is likely 11-12 years old and Misty 9 years old but they do appear somewhat younger. If you're looking for a pair of bonded senior dogs, please consider meeting Misty and Ralph. Submit the adoption application (no commitment) found on our website, www.satchelslastresort.org, and adoption counselor will get back to you to set up an appointment.",

Todd has settled in nicely with his foster pack and is a pretty laid back dog. He no longer howls due to anxiety and he's become quite the snuggler. He loves to play with his foster brother, he loves mealtime and he's walking like a champ with a leash and gentle leader. He's very gentle and submissive with my dogs and will now come to people for love/pets. He will need a family with a privacy fenced yard or a condo type scenario as he still likes to take adventures if not on leash and has an impressive vertical. He still has occasional accidents in the house if I'm not watching him, but he's amenable to keeping his diaper on in the house. His recall is improving and he's treat motivated so he should be easy to train. We are currently working on \"sit\" and \"wait.\" He's a young dog eager to please and will make someone a wonderful pet!\n\nAdoption fee includes: Full veterinary exam, alter, prepaid microchip, dewormed, Rabies vaccine, DAPP vaccine, Bordetella vaccine, 4DX\n\n, flea/tick and heartworm preventative while in rescue. Adoption fee:\n\n$395.00",

She can be a little nervous of new situations but adjusts quickly. She is very friendly and loves to get lots of attention! She seems to be dog friendly, seems to be housebroken and walks well on a leash. Ethel is heartworm positive but don\u2019t worry, the shelter pays for her treatment.\n\nADOPTION HOURS: \n\nWe are currently adopting out animals by appointment only Tuesday through Sunday 1:00 P.M. through 4:00 P.M. with an approved application.

He's very energetic, active, and playful. He is excitable and a little rambunctious at times. He is not good with other dogs, but great with people. He is people oriented, friendly, and outgoing. He's working on his leash skills and would benefit from further training. Atticus will need to go to a home with a fenced in yard or to a large SAFE property where he can get the exercise he needs.\n...................................If you would like further information or would like to request an adoption application, please e-mail us directly at hss@cablelynx.com.

            "description": "Chuck is a classic Jack Russell Terrier but with the grace and wisdom that only comes with age. He lived with the same family for the first ten years of his life and came into our care after being surrendered to a Quebec shelter for behavioural and health issues. It took us a few weeks to understand Chuck\u2019s particularities, but we think he is finally ready to find his perfect co-pilot. \n\nChuck is a sweet, gentle, and whip-smart little guy. He is keen to learn and please his human friends. Although he is not a \u201cvelcro dog,\u201d he does have extreme separation anxiety and cannot be crated or left alone for any period of time. Separation anxiety is extremely difficult to cure and we need to find Chuck a family who will understand that. It\u2019s also important that his new family encourages healthy boundaries and rules to ensure it doesn\u2019t escalate. \n\nDespite his age, Chuck loves to go for long walks and playtime. He displays leash reactivity when confronted with other dogs. His foster parents have been working on this behaviour and it\u2019s important that his new family continues this training to help him enjoy his time outside without the anxiety he currently feels. Chuck requires the stimulation and bonding that walks around the neighbourhood provide. He is polite and friendly with new people, interested in chasing squirrels and pigeons, and is lovely around cats. \n\nWith proper exercise, Chuck is calm and quiet in the home. He loves to make a little nest and snooze the afternoon away. He has excellent house manners, rarely barks, knows basic tricks and commands, and is potty trained. Chuck is currently being fostered in an apartment in a busy neighbourhood in downtown Toronto. He\u2019s done very well in the car and is a gentleman in Ubers and on the TTC. \n\nChuck has recently been diagnosed with a rare condition called diabetes insipidus (essentially, hormonal diabetes). The illness makes him drink water excessively and subsequently, pee excessively. Chuck has started medication to manage the symptoms and we are very much hoping they will resolve the issue. He will likely need these meds and regular vet visits for the rest of his life. We estimate the cost of his meds will be c. $40 a month.\n\nChuck is looking for a best friend to share adventures and the couch. He loves human affection and praise, thrives with positive reinforcement and a calm home environment. He really enjoys training and learning new commands\u2026 so I guess you CAN teach an old dog new tricks! Oh and if he could have a feline brother or sister he\u2019d like that a lot too. \n",

She came to BarkVille severely malnourished & underweight, but fortunately we were able to place her in a wonderful foster home where she is putting on healthy weight every day.  She loves food & treats and enjoys gobbling everything up as soon as she sees it!  She is a happy, quiet, calm, easy keeper who snorts & grunts like the adorable, little piggy she is!  She is a low energy girl who likes to play a little bit each day & loves chewing on her hard bones, but overall is very content to relax & chill with her family.  Her #1 requirement is a window that she can lay in front of to see outside because that is most definitely her favorite place to be!  Her foster mom says that Lucy is the ultimate companion ... very loving & attentive to whoever is near her.  She doesn't need a lot of exercise, but she enjoys going for walks (although her leash manners are still a work in progress).  She is very smart & eager to please and could be a great fit for a person/family looking for a loyal, devoted companion who doesn't need to be exercised daily.  Lucy can live happily in an apt/condo or a single family home with fenced yard.  She is perfectly house trained & crate trained, spayed, fully vaccinated & microchipped.  \n\nTo see more videos of this super cute girl, copy & paste these links into your browser ...\n\nhttps://youtu.be/V66PYuJco-w\nhttps://youtu.be/-GsyEUsrvzQ\n\nFor more information about the lovable miss Lucy, please email us at info@barkvilledogrescue.org. If you would like to adopt this sweet girl, please submit an application for her at https://www.barkvilledogrescue.org/applications",

Gigi responds well to positive-reinforcement training techniques and is currently working on her leash skills. She loves tasty treats and is food motivated, but really needs a weight-loss/exercise plan to start the new year off on the right foot. Gigi would like to be the only pet in her new home. \n\nWe hold adoption events each Saturday at PetSmart (3736 SW Archer Rd, Gainesville, FL 32608) from 11am until 5pm; we do not have a public facility. This is the time to meet our adoptables and potentially take home your newest Faithful Friend. Our adoption fees vary and are cash, card or Venmo but include spay/neuter, heartworm test (dogs), FeLV/FIV test (cats), age appropriate vaccines and deworming, flea, tick and heartworm medication and microchip. All of our adoptables are already spayed or neutered prior to adoption.",

He loves to play with his furry foster brothers. Baxter is just the cutest!\nIf you'd like to consider fostering him until he's ready to be adopted and can join your family for good, please submit an adoption application.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION: www.tinyurl.com/IADRAdoptionApp\n\nIf you'd like to help Baxter while he searches for his very own family, you can sponsor him for only $19/month here: https://petbucks.org/pet/6218/sponsor/create\n\n\n***IMPORTANT- PLEASE READ***\nThe State of Texas requires rescues to collect sales tax on any adoption fees. Our adoption fee is $175. Texas State Sales Tax will be added to that amount.\n\nDue to the nature of our adoption process, our fosters are usually only able to consider forever families within a reasonable driving distance of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. A vet reference is required, and a trial period will be completed before finalizing the adoption. Thank you for your understanding.",

I have a very sad story and it touched the hearts of my rescue and they came and got me from the shelter. I was with my owner in Reidsville North Carolina when someone shot and killed him when we were walking. I didn\u2019t know what to do so I guarded his body until the help arrived. These nice policemen came and picked me up and took me to the shelter where I had to stay from 10/16/20 until my rescue pulled me on 1/11/21 when I became available. I had to be held for investigation and I was so confused as to what happened to my person and what I had done wrong to be taken to a shelter. The ladies there gave me lots of love and attention and now I\u2019m in a loving foster home waiting on someone to choose me. I am house trained dog friendly and do well with children. They do not know about cats since my foster does not have one. I just want a new home of my very own and people to love me and give me a safe home. What I went through was very traumatic and I do not want to lose another human that I love that way. If you think you are the right family and can love me forever, please contact my rescue for an adoption application. I promise to be a good girl and love you forever. \nLove \nRoxie",

She loves to snuggle. Seriously! She never wants you to stop petting her and loves to be rubbed behind the ears. Your reward is little piggy grunting noises to show her approval.\n\nThis cuddlebug is house trained and crate trained. While she doesn't know many commands yet, Gypsy is a quick study. She is kid friendly, but should be the only dog in the home. Can you help Gypsy find her forever family?\n\nIf you are interested in adding this pup to your family, please submit an application at www.petrescuealliance.com. All questions will be answered and meet and greets set up following a review of application. If the dog is listed on our website or Petfinder, they are still available! Pet Rescue Alliance does our best to provide accurate information about the dogs we have available for adoption. We cannot make any guarantees about age, breed or temperament.",

PLEASE READ ENTIRE BIO BEFORE EMAILING****\n\n*Name: Sally\n*Age: 7 years\n*Current Weight: 45 pounds\n*Rescued from: Texas\n*Adoption fee: $375 (plus $125 spay/neuter deposit, which is refundable when spay/neuter agreement is fulfilled)\n*Health: up to date on required vaccines\n\nSally has had a rough life, and we are looking for the perfect home for this girl.  Sally is good with other dogs, loves to explore outside and go for neighborhood walks.  She is great in a car and enjoys going for rides.  Sally is house broken,  crate trained, spayed, heartworm negative and UTD on her vaccines. Sally has learned to trust her foster mom but unfortunately, she continues to be fearful of her foster dad.  Sally probably needs an all female home and only older considerate kids.  Another canine sibling would be great for Sally and a fenced yard.   Sally shines bright and is such a loving dog when given the needed time to develop trust with her people.\n\nTo apply to adopt Sally, fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. \n\n**Meet and greets will not be scheduled without an approved application.**\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n-------------------------------------------------------\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $375 for adults. Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n\n\n",

Please read this posting to answer most of your questions about me.\n\nHello  meet Pigglet a beautiful mix that was surrendered to the the Hope Fur Pets Rescue. Pigglet was found as a stray near one of the volunteers homes after posting and asking the neighbors in the area Pigglets owner decided to surrender to us as they couldn't care for him any longer. He is super sweet and appears to get along with other dogs as long as they are easy going, he prefers dogs his own size. He is super sweet and friendly to everyone he meets. We named him Pigglet because he does a lot of snorting like a pig. He is really gentle and doesn't jump up on you so he would be okay with smaller kids.  I'm all up to date on vet care appropriate for my age including heartworm prevention, spay/neuter, microchip and all vaccinations and ready to be the newest member of your home! \n\nPlease fill out our application an application is required in order to be considered: copy the below text and paste it into your browser:  \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1K_84a3Y0wF0QbdYBz17b10Uwm4kAXxz-Y0Gx5HexZz0/edit\n\nIf you have any questions, please send an email to hopefurpets@gmail.com\n\nUs fur-kids deserve a second chance. Thank you for supporting rescues who help ensure we get one! And please remember to spay and neuter your pets and neighborhood strays! While I was at the shelter, I couldn't believe all of the wonderful dogs, cats, puppies, and kittens who are homeless. Take it from me, being homeless is no fun!\n\nApplication is required. No member of our organization receives proceeds from our adoption fees.  All dogs have past experiences, preferences and personalities.  Please always consider the personality and breed tendencies of any pup that you are interested in adopting to ensure that he or she will be the perfect fit for your home, for both your sake and his!  Do not select a forever companion based on looks alone.  Make this home his or her home for life!",

            "description": "If you are interested in adopting this dog, please download and complete an Adoption Questionnaire from our website and email Michelle at mhunt@k-9lifesavers.org\nYou can learn about the adoption process and find a Word, PDF and ONLINE version of the questionnaire by visiting: http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/howtoadopt/.\nDog's Name: Eva\nEstimated Breed : Miniature Pinscher Mix\nApproximate Age: 1-2 years\nApproximate Weight: approx. 30 lbs\nCurrently Living at: Boarding\nAdoption Fee: $300\nDOG'S DESCRIPTION\nDo you like to be busy... well so does Eva! Eva is a very energetic, happy little gal hoping to find a home with lots of toys! She will need an active family with a fenced in back yard to so that she can run and play. Due to her high energy level, she will not be able to be placed in apt/condos. She is also not found of cats. Who wants some EVA LOVE?\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\nSponsor Me! Make a tax-deductible donation today by visiting us at http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/donate/ . Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support!\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\nPlease \"like\" our Facebook Page for the most current events and new dogs.\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!",

Below the map is our logo and the link to click on to access adoption forms, contact info or to donate. ALL DONATIONS ARE TAX DEDUCTIBLE.\n\n\nAdoption Fee: $150.00 for both\n\n \nThese boys are looking for a forever home, they were not able to be cared for by their family and SCMR agreed to help them find a new home.They both have lost some of their house manners, but are working on that.  They are not liter mates, but are siblings from the same home.\n \nOzzy is a toy poodle, he is 12 years old and weighs 8 pounds, he is neutered, he is blind but will learn his space and loves to take lots of naps.  Ozzy loves to walk around confidently in the yard enjoying the smells and he is happy to let you know it's dinnertime with a woof or two.\n \nFozzie is a Maltese, is 14 years old, and weighs 6 pounds. He is neutered and very loving.    He loves to cuddle and is a true lap dog.   He hardly has any teeth, and is hard of hearing, but he responds to everything going on around him.\n \nA NOTE FROM THE BOYS' FOSTER MOM:\n \nFozzie, the older of the two, pops around like a puppy.  He is petite and adorable.  I haven't seen any aggression in him at all.  Sometimes he \"talks\" in a soft growly voice, but he is not a barker.  He loves to sleep with me and cuddle.\n \nOzzie is younger but his blindness has slowed him down a bit.  He enjoys the yard and walks around happily picking up all the \"messages\" left by my other foster pups adding his own to them!  Unlike many dogs who lose their sight, he hasn't become fearful or nervous, and he dearly loves being held and talked to. Ozzie lets me know when it's time for breakfast and will complain if I'm too slow making dinner.  Neither have any special dietary needs, are not fussy, and not on any meds. They both wear belly bands in the house, but we all go out several times a day so they barely get wet.\n\nThey are located in Largo, FL loving life!!!.\n\n\nNOTE: SCMR DOES NOT adopt to homes with children under the age of 10 years or homes with Electric Fences\n\nOut-of-state adoptions are possible; however, the approved adoptive home is responsible for making the necessary arrangements to pick up their new little one.",

He is 3 years old and weighs 19 pounds. \nAll dogs in our program are current on all their shots and micro chipped.  Also included is one FREE group session with our amazing trainer to his Street Obedience Class is included and not to be missed.We do not place dogs on a first come first serve basis, but rather to the home best suited for them. An adoption fee, application, and contract are required. All our dogs can be met with an approved application.

I hug, want to be a lap dog and just want to be near you. I am a stunning Blue Merle with one brown and one blue eye (do not despair I see just fine!).\n\nI like toys and will toss them around and play. I like other dogs, I\u2019m athletic, focused and intense. Did I mention I like big comfy dog beds? I was a stray, and I\u2019m learning manners and how to live in a house, and how to share, but, I may not be good with cats, chickens or toddlers. If you are looking for a love bug and want a typical border collie, I\u2019m it.\n\nBCRRT is a Texas based rescue with fosters in TX and OK. Our adoption areas are TX, OK and surrounding states.

He gets along with other dogs and would do well in a home with older children who have been around dogs.  It's unknown how he is around cats.  Handsome requires at least a 4 foot fence.\n\nHandsome is 9 years old. His current weight is around 65 pounds.\n\nThe minimum donation for Handsome is $450.00. This includes all of his vetting. If you are interested in Handsome, please fill out an online application through our website.\n\nWe are currently only open by appointment only. Due to the recent pandemic, we are looking at the safety of our volunteers that are there to take care of the dogs. Only serious inquiries will be considered.\n\nThen meet him at the shelter during adoption hours on Saturdays and Sundays 10 - 2pm. All members of the household need to meet the dog you are interested in. Vet records for any current or previous pets need to be provided. If all goes well, a home visit will be done prior to adoption.",

He is blind in one eye and has limited vision in the other. This does not stop him from enjoying himself and getting around. If taken outside on a consistent basis he may not have accidents inside but because of his age, this is not unusual. This may increase as he gets older as well. He loves to sleep beside you but it is also independent and likes to explore. Mr Chips needs a loving person to appreciate him and love him for the time he has remaining. He will bring you joy, gratitude, and his love in return. His adoption fee is $175.",

They must be kept together. I have known them since she brought them home; both are social dogs and good with people, kids and other dogs. Both are trained house dogs, are full of energy and need a fenced yard and space to run and/or regular walks. As much as it will break my heart to let these boys go, I have a very demanding job, travel frequently and do not have a large fenced yard that they are accustomed to. I am hoping to find someone who can give them regular attention who has a large yard for them to run or will be active with them and who hopefully wouldn't mind keeping in touch with me. They have been raised as part of the family.\n\nBentley is a 10 yr old black lab. I believe he is over 100 lbs of muscle; though he thinks he is a lap dog. He is very friendly and still has lots of energy to play and run. For the past 7-8 yrs he has had a large fenced yard to run in and I don't believe he has walked on a leash much so he could use some leash manners but he does respond to basic commands (Come, heal, sit, etc). He does like to chase wild animals so I would not let him (or Malcolm) run freely outside an enclosure just for their safety. I know my sister used to take him to the dog park when she was able to. He eats twice a day and usually gobbles down all his food when given. He does like to beg but will usually listen if you tell him to go lay down. I have not noticed him being a jumper. He is a big baby and likes lots of attention. Bently is currently on some maintenance meds/supplements (arthritis, allergies, joint health). Since he has been with me I have noticed his allergies (some itching and a hot spot on his front leg) but I would never have known he has arthritis. \n\nMalcolm is a 12 yr old Chesapeake Bay Retiever mix, guessing roughly 60 pounds. I know he passed therapy dog training and my sister used to take him to Verland to visit the residents there when she worked there years ago. I haven't been able to locate his certificate unfortunately. He is very docile and affectionate. He does like to bark when he hears the doorbell or sees someone walking down the street. He has much better leash manners than Bentley. Malcom has had allergies off and on but I have not noticed him having any issues since he has been with me. He does have a lipoma (benign fatty tumor) on his shoulder (visible in some of the pics) but does not seem to cause him any pain or other issues. He is in good health.\n\nBoth have beds, collars, leashes, bowls, toys, etc which can go with them.\n\nIf there is any other information I can provide please feel free to call me 412-266-4670.",

            "description": "Meet Lucy! She arrived at the shelter expecting and gave birth to two puppies. Fosters & Paws focusing on mama dogs and their puppies brought the family into safety. Pups are weaned, committed to forever families while Lucy is working on getting her figure back, ready for a forever family with shepherd experience. \n\nLucy is delightful, but she needs structure and training to be her best self like all shepherds. She is super people friendly, wiggles her butt with her tail wagging non-stop, especially if you have a toy or treats for her. A busy girl, Lucy is ready to stretch her legs and get some much-needed exercise after lovingly caring for her babies and healing from her spay. \n\nAged at 5 years, she is beautiful with her puppy bearing years behind her. Lucy will need some leash work, encouragement not to jump when excited. She is crate and potty trained. Showing way too much interest in fuzzy little things, no cats, small dogs, or critters for this strong girl in her forever home. \n\nCurrently, she prefers to keep dogs at about a 2 -3 feet distance, which could be hormonal as her body is adjusting post-pregnancy. She is re-directed easily on a leash. At this time, it is unknown if she would be open to living with another dog.\n\nIf interested in Lucy, she is available through Fosters & Paws (www.fosterandpaws.org/adopt) for meetings with approved adopters with the recommendation to be a solo shepherd in her furever home. This is a courtesy post for our friends at Fosters & Paws following our evaluation of Lucy.",

Once approved you will be called for an appointment to meet your possible new family member, or at that time you can meet the other animals as well. https://petstablished.com/public/search/shelter/301551\n\nAdoption fee is $150 which includes, spay/neuter, vaccines, etc, and a free 1 year membership to our 5 acre ARF Park. For other dog questions please email ARFdogs74006@gmail.com\n\nWe do adopt out of state, but the adopter must travel to ARF to meet the dog they are looking to adopt. They must have an approved application before traveling to meet the dog. We do allow small dogs that are eligible to fly in the cabin of a plane. We DO NOT allow dogs to travel in the cargo area of the plane under any circumstances. Any dog that is adopted can of course go by personal vehicle. We do not allow dogs to be transported \"pony express style\" where they are passed from driver to driver.",

Teddy is just under a year old and is just a big goofy puppy who loves attention, so much so he wants to be in your lap always! He is very smart and eager to learn, he knows basic commands and is very treat motivated. He would love a big fenced in yard to run around and play in as he still has a lot of puppy energy. Teddy gets along great with other dogs, would be best matched with a dog his size. \nIf interested in meeting Teddy please fill out an application at fureverfriendz.org to be considered. \nTeddy's adoption fee is $300 which includes his neuter, microchip, vaccines and heartworm test current.",

            "description": "Bernadette (formerly Princess) is a sweet senior beagle looking to be someones cuddle buddy. Shes around 8 years old and although this gal has been through a lot, she always has a cute little smile on her face. She has the most luxurious hound dog ears and makes little piggie noises when you cuddle her. She gets along well with other dogs but would probably prefer calmer dog friends. Bernie loves squeaky toys and is wild for treats and meals. She is working on losing some extra weight and making good progress, but will need a home that can continue to help her get into shape. Its a good thing that, in addition to being a couch potato, she loves going for walks! Bernie is mostly potty trained but will need some reinforcement in her new home. She also has a bit of separation anxiety when left alone so she would do best in a home with another dog or a person who is home most of the time and can help her work on her crating skills. Although Bernie is a lover, no cat companions for this gal please.\n\nBernadette's adoption fee is $195. Email your adoption coordinator if you are an approved applicant or apply today at rescuedohio.org to become approved!",

He loves a good walk or play session with his foster fur siblings. He is good with other dogs of all sizes and even does well with cats! At the end of the day he enjoys cuddling up in his dog bed or on the couch with his people. He is going to need a family who has patience since this 70lb dude has a lot of fear about the world. He does have slight anxiety which makes it pretty hard for him to control his body, but with consistent boundary setting and schedule he will mold right into a home. He does well outside of a crate and can be trusted when left alone, you'll return to find him snuggled up in his donut dog bed or in the corner of the couch. A family with older kiddos (because of that puppy energy) and someone who has another fur baby would be best to teach him the ways of the world! \n\nMeet and greets can be arranged for approved adopters; apply today at rescuedohio.org or reach out to your rescue coordinator.

I am a little timid and shy at first but I am slowly but surely coming out of my shell. I enjoy playing with my toys and going for walks around the neighborhood with my foster parents. I am still working on my leash skills as I get excited for my walks but do tucker out easily with these little legs of mine. I'm hoping to go for longer walks as I get more acclimated from growing up in Texas. My foster parents don't know much about my past but everyday I like to show them something new, like my tricks of sit and shake! Although I enjoy hanging out and cuddles with my foster family, I also enjoy my space. I don't mind being in my kennel when you are away or sleeping, as I'm a pretty quiet and easy going guy. I am house trained and have had with no accidents. If you're looking for a little buddy, I could be your guy!\n\n \n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

If you are a good fit for the animal you are interested in -we will call to speak with you, If we feel you are not a good fit , we will contact you about other pets that may be a good fit for your home. Many people are losing the opportunity to adopt the animal they want because they fail to put in an application and the pet was adopted before we could answer your email. .If you have applied for an animal in our facility and have not received a response within 7 days, PLEASE call or contact us again. Though we do our best in trying to answer all emails in a timely manner, sometimes things get away from us, get lost or misplaced. It is never our intention to ignore a request about an adoptable animal in our facility.\n\nSandy Brown, Director, PAW Animal Shelter\n\n319-372-2274",

WE are a high intake No Kill Shelter ran by a staff of 4 and do not always have time to answer every question asked by so many. If you are a good fit for the animal you are interested in -we will call to speak with you, If we feel you are not a good fit , we will contact you about other pets that may be a good fit for your home. Many people are losing the opportunity to adopt the animal they want because they fail to put in an application and the pet was adopted before we could answer your email. .If you have applied for an animal in our facility and have not received a response within 7 days, PLEASE call or contact us again. Though we do our best in trying to answer all emails in a timely manner, sometimes things get away from us, get lost or misplaced. It is never our intention to ignore a request about an adoptable animal in our facility.\n\nSandy Brown, Director, PAW Animal Shelter\n\n319-372-2274",

            "description": "***Thank you for your interest in Magnificent Mutts and Meows. We hope everyone is saying safe during this challenging time. Due to the current regulations set forth by Governor Pritzker on group gatherings we will not be having adoption events until further notice. As an all foster based rescue this means that all meets will be by appointment only. Your whole family must be available to attend the meet as there will be no second meets scheduled to help limit contact between our team and the public. To help streamline the process please make sure your current pets are up to date, you have landlord/HOA approval, and that you are prepared to take the dog home with you immediately before submitting an application. Thank you & Please stay safe!***\n\nPaloma just arrived. She is approx 2 years old. GSD. She will be vetted and assessed so we can learn more about her. We know at this time she does need leash work so a fenced in yard (no chain link she can climb it!) would be ideal.\nShe is extremely shy so she will need a quiet home with a patient owner who is willing to work with her to overcome her fears. She is sweet and good with other dogs in fact another dog in the home will help ease her fears as well. Cats are unknown at this time. Any children in the home should be older and dog savvy realizing that Paloma needs her space and time to come around.\n\nMore information and additional restrictions may be added once she fully settles into foster care and we learn her full likes and dislikes.\n\nIf you are interested in adoption, please complete the Application to Adopt which you can find on our website (\nwww.magnificentmutts.org\n) No phone calls please. Emails only.\n\nAdoption Donation $300 (cash only)\n\nPlease visit www.magnificentmutts.org for the online dog or cat application.\n\nAdoption Fees*\n\nAdult cats starting at $125, Kittens starting at $165.\nDogs/Puppies starting at $225 minimum\nPrices subject to change, please contact for specific adoption donations.",

He is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4510410.\n\nOne of the saddest reasons a dog can be E-listed is because they are mentally breaking down in their kennel. This is what's happened to me. I am really struggling and it is inhumane to keep me here in this condition. I also did not pass my dog to dog evaluation at the shelter. Many dogs do not get along with other dogs....is this a reason to take my life away?...No!\nCan someone save my life?\n\nLeeroy has been a little mouthy at times at the shelter, but this is likely due to being stressed and overwhelmed at the shelter. He exits his kennel quickly and pulls moderately hard to the play yard. After just a couple weeks he became familiar with his go-to handler and is very friendly with him and leans in for pets. He really just wants to be loved, he is just scared at the shelter. Leeroy is only 4 years old and has a lot of life to live, and a lot of love to give! Are you the right home for Leeroy??\n\nTo meet me, please call 480 331 4188 or message us here. If you have a dog you need to bring down for a dog intro. Dog Savers has got over 230 E-listed dogs in the last year out of the shelter alive! A small percent of the donations go to our operating costs to help these dogs get out alive. Lets keep working together to save lives!!\n\nIf you are interested in saving this pet, please reach out via this link: https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/foster/BPAZ/Dog\n\n*Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG.",

Due to the current regulations set forth by Governor Pritzker on group gatherings we will not be having adoption events until further notice. As an all foster based rescue this means that all meets will be by appointment only. Your whole family must be available to attend the meet as there will be no second meets scheduled to help limit contact between our team and the public. To help streamline the process please make sure your current pets are up to date, you have landlord/HOA approval, and that you are prepared to take the dog home with you immediately before submitting an application. Thank you & Please stay safe!***\n\nOrejas just arrived. He is approx 1-2 years old. GSD. Orejas can climb a chain link fence so if his new home has chain link his owners should be aware and take precautions.\nHe does need leash work as he is very strong and pulls.\nOrejas does needs to be the only dog in the home as he likes all the attention on him. He can be shy, but is sweet. Older kids only for Orejas. And cats are unknown\n\nMore information and additional restrictions may be added once he fully settles into foster care and we learn his full likes and dislikes.\n\nIf you are interested in adoption, please complete the Application to Adopt which you can find on our website (\nwww.magnificentmutts.org\n) No phone calls please. Emails only.\n\nAdoption Donation $300 (cash only)\n\nPlease visit www.magnificentmutts.org for the online dog or cat application.\n\nAdoption Fees*\n\nAdult cats starting at $125, Kittens starting at $165.\nDogs/Puppies starting at $225 minimum\nPrices subject to change, please contact for specific adoption donations.",

He is guessed to be around 10 months old, very playful and energic, lacking some young puppy training. He will require some basic training and while he does get a long playfully with other dogs, he will need to be strictly guided when it comes to guarding food and toys. An experienced dog owner is the best suit for this dog, and we do not recommend a home with young children due to his lack of training and structure prior to rescue. \nArtemis will be available to adoption after his neuter on 1/25/21.

He's house broken, crate trained, and keeps to his own things. Tennessee enjoys long walks under the stars, play dates, or simply cuddling on the couch. Adopt your best friend, good 'ol boy Tennessee, today! \n\nTennessee is almost 2 years old and weighs about 55 pounds.\n\nIf you're interested in meeting Tennessee, please visit our website to learn about our adoption process and to fill out an application, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs and cats will be micro-chipped, spayed or neutered, and up-to-date on vaccinations at the time of adoption. For more photos of Tennessee, follow us on Facebook Gateway Pet Guardians and Instagram @gatewaypets ... #gpgTennessee. \n\nTo view other adoptable pets from our shelter, please visit, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nGateway Pet Guardians is proud to offer a variety of mixed breed dogs available for adoption. However, please keep in mind that we rarely know the genetic background of the animals we rescue and, as such, we cannot guarantee the exact breed combinations found within this dog. However, we do not know his/her actual genetic makeup. Just know that this dog is probably a variety of several different breeds that have combined to create one very amazing and unique animal.",

Learn more about me by reading my profile below; I just might be your new best friend! Apply on our website\n(\n\nhttps://www.healingheartsrescue.org/adopt\n\n)\n\nto\n\nset up a private meeting or check below for my adoption event schedule.\n\nAge: Approximately 1 year old\n\nWeight: 45-50 pounds\n\nDog friendly: Dog\n\nselective - prefers calmer dogs her size - or best as an only dog\n\nCat friendly: No kitties please\n\nKid friendly: Yes, I love all people\n\nPotty trained: Mostly, working on it\n\nCrate trained: Yes\n\nFence: I'd love a fenced in yard, but not required\n\nHi I'm Java! I'm a beautiful energetic lady on the lookout for my new family. I love people and think everyone is my new best friend. When we meet I'll run to you with my tail wagging so fast you can't even see it. Watch out because kisses will be following this! I'm pretty sure I'm a lap dog because when it's cuddle time on the couch I'll be at close to you as possible. I'm currently working on lots of new things like leash training. I walk nice inside on it but pull outside because there's so many good things to smell and see. With some training I'm sure I could be a great hiking and jogging partner. If you have a fenced yard I could do my zoomies there! That would be so fun! I keep my kennel clean but will whine in it for a minute here and there. I want to be with my people. Can you blame a girl for wanting to be with her family? I'd also like to be your only baby so that I don't have to share your love. We all need a cup of Java in the morning, can I be yours?\n\nAdoption Fee: $295\n\nINTERESTED IN MEETING ME?\n\nIf you'd like to arrange a private meeting or begin the adoption process, please fill out an adoption application by visiting\n\nhttps://www.healingheartsrescue.org/adopt\n\n**Note on breed and age determination:\n\nBreed and age are often determined on appearance, our own knowledge, veterinarian advice, and/or information from the sending shelters or previous owners. Most of our adoptable dogs were previously stray dogs with little history, we can't be 100% sure of a dog's breed mix, and unless there is a specific date of birth listed, we can't be 100% sure of a dog's age. Additionally, our assessments of a dog's interactions with other dogs, cats, or children are based on OUR experiences. Your experience may differ.\n\nADOPTION FEE INCLUDES:\n\nWellness check\n\nSpay/neuter (puppies adopted with required spay/neuter certificate)\n\nAge appropriate vaccines - rabies as required by law and distemper combo or proof of positive titer test\n\nHeartworm test if over 7 months of age\n\nFecal test and/or deworming for parasites\n\nMicrochip\n\n\n\n~ Healing Hearts rescue will also provide dental procedures, bloodwork, surgeries, and/or any other additional vet work as needed while dogs are in our care.\n\n~ Adoption fees are non-negotiable and fees are listed on the dog's profile\n\n~ Adoption fees can be paid the following ways with the required sales tax (7.525%) added:\n\nPayPal\n\nCredit Card\n\nCash\n\nWANT TO HELP SAVE MORE DOGS?\n\nHealing Hearts Rescue is a nonprofit, foster-based rescue\n\nlocated in the Twin Cities area of Minnesota\n\nthat is 100% funded through adoption fees and donations\n\n. We are excited for you to join us on this mission to save the lives of dogs in need.\n\nWe believe every dog deserves to be loved as true members of a family and are committed to fulfilling that dream one dog at a time!

He's an energetic and playful guy who would make a good active time partner. He came from a home with a lot of dogs and never got to be the center of someone's attention. Lewie likes the company of other pups of any size and would enjoy sharing a home with a canine companion. We think Lewie do best in a home with adults and children 12+. We recommend a single family home due to how vocal hounds can be. Lewie is a sweet boy looking for a family to really dote upon him.\nxxx\nxxx\n\nPlease note: \nWe are currently adopting out of state for our longer stay animals only.

            "description": "Many of you may feel like you know me already.  My name is Zelda and I arrived at AGPR on November 1, 2020. My previous owners asked their wonderful vet to take me in because I was only a year old and could not walk well on my back legs and they could not afford surgery.  I am so glad they did what was right for me - x-rays were taken and I was diagnosed with the canine version of torn ACL in both hind legs.\n\nThe wonderful people at AGPR welcomed me with open arms and scheduled my first surgery for the morning after I arrived.  And boy, were they surprised with my speedy recovery.  I felt like I could run a marathon a week after surgery (of course they refused to let me show them I could).  My second surgery is scheduled for my other leg right before Valentines Day, 2021.  I am hoping for another speedy recovery because I can NOT stand that silly \"cone of shame\".\n\nAssuming all goes well, I expect to be released to go to my forever home sometime in April.  \n\nI've been good around kids, but I've always been on a leash.  I am a BIG girl and once my leg is healed, I have a lot of youthful energy to burn.  Remember, I've spent the first year of my life not being able to run and play like a youngster. \n\nI've been told I am a pretty girl.  People love my markings and my sweet disposition.  I'm willing to start \"interviewing\" potential new families the first week in February.  It would be nice to know I have a family to go home to when the surgeon gives me the final \"okay\".\n\nAll Great Pyrenees require a fenced-in yard (at least four foot high). If you have questions about the breed or our adoption policies and procedures, please go to our website at www.agprescue.org.  There's plenty of good information about the breed on our website - Pyrs aren't a breed for everyone!\n\nOur adoption application is online: http://agprescue.org/adoption-application/agpr-application-donations/  Please note that we are a small regional rescue organization.  We will consider adopting to families within a four to five hour drive to Richmond, VA",

            "description": "Puzzle is a friendly, happy, people-pleasing, 3.5 year old, 44 lb boy who wants as much love as he gives, which is a lot! We think he is a Terrier/American Bulldog mix. Puzzle likes car rides, snuggling, and chasing tennis balls. He is food motivated for ease of training, knows some basic commands, and is really good on the leash with a Gentle Leader headcollar. Puzzle will check in with you on walks to get a treat. He is about 95% house-trained. This sweet pup is not a high energy dog, but he will need a yard to play in, preferably with a fence, even though he will most likely want to do whatever you are doing, most of the time. He will do best in a home with older kids, 16 and up or adults only, as he is still learning how to play and might mistake small children for playmates. Well-socialized female dogs his size or smaller can be a good match for him, but he likes to get all the attention, so being an only dog would be just fine. Puzzle is crate-trained, neutered and up to date on vaccines and preventatives.\n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $350 which includes routine vetting and spay/neuter. \n\nFor more information, please contact Mandy at msmith@petconnectrescue.org\n\n**If you're viewing this on Petfinder, please visit www.petconnectrescue.org to complete our non-binding application.**",

Lulu is your typical Chihuahua who likes affection, until she is done. She does fine with other dogs, but prefers to sit back and just watch what is going on with them. She prefers a home with no children or only older children.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Lulu please submit an inquiry directly with Greater Charlotte SPCA by visiting charlottespca.org/adopt.\n\n***Because our rescue is composed entirely of volunteers and we require a home check for each of our adoptable pets prior to them going to their new homes, local applications will take precedence. We will accept out of town applications, but any family further than 60 miles from Charlotte is responsible for finding a representative of a rescue local to them that is willing to perform the home check. All out of town applicants will also have to be willing to drive to Charlotte to meet/pick up the pet as soon as the application is approved.***",

This bundle of joyous energy is bound to make one active family very happy.  \n\nWe can't say for sure everything that's in this sweetie, but her tail, coat, and appetite speak to Lab, her spots speak to a Heeler or Pointer (she does point) or both as does her brilliant mind and sensitive soul, and there is probably a touch of pittie in there for a touch of wiggle butt.  A better purebred mutt mix was never had.  \n\nHazelnut is about a year old and is around 62 pounds, so right at the top end of a medium-sized dog and the low end of a large-sized dog.  She is not great on leash yet (she thinks everyone just wants to have fun including on a walk), and she does believe she is a couch dog.  \n\nThis girl would be great in an active home that can give her exercise/walks.  She may inadvertently knock young ones over so, though she does love kids, resident kids should probably be old enough to stand their ground.  She gets along great with the large dogs in her foster home but her energy and desire to like everyone scares some of the small dogs.  Cats will probably not like her lack of boundaries when meeting a new animal but we do not believe she would harm them.  Hazelnut sleeps through the night in a crate and just wants to be loved.  \n\nIf you believe your home has been looking for a shot of sweet Hazelnut then read on or go directly to the adoption process page of our website, throwmeabondogrescue.org, to apply.  \n\nAll potential adopters are expected to complete an application and provide pictures of their yard, patio, and/or balcony making sure we can see the fence line and/or railing.  The application can be completed and submitted from our website - throwmeabonedogrescue.org - the link is found of the Adoption Process page.  Applications will be reviewed for approval before setting an appointment to come meet and possibly adopt the dog of interest.  In addition, those who live in a rental property are expected to provide proof that they are allowed to have a dog where they live.\n\nEach of our rescued dogs has been de-wormed if necessary, de-flea'd (with topical treatment if old enough, and by medicated bath if too young), spayed/neutered, microchipped, is up to date on shots, and has been fully examined by a veterinarian.  In addition, each adopted dog comes with a starter baggie of the food it has been eating, a few treats for training purposes, a rawhide chew, a lead and collar, and a folder containing pertinent records.",

            "description": "OLIVE BRANCH CITY PARK DOG HAS SURRENDERED HIMSELF TO THIS HUMAN. \nParker is scheduled to be neutered Wednesday, January 27th.  He will be heartworm tested, get his rabies vaccine and a microchip.\nHe is now safe and with save1pet in Olive Branch. No microchip. Not neutered, about 1 to 1 1/2 years old. Friendly. \nWas surprised he was dry after all the rain. Probably slept on a picnic table under one of the pavilions. He\u2019s been out there since at least Monday, December 28th.\nThis guy is making progress today!  He was still so scared and trembling this morning every time I approached him to try and get him out of the kennel to go outside. I was determined not to force him and I think that paid off. I knew he had to potty and he\u2019s old enough to know he sure didn\u2019t want to mess his kennel. But he did. Within a half hour he pooped 3 times. So now I knew I had to get him out. I opened door and he approached and I slipped on the leash. He did amazing and out the side door we went. Lola was on the other side of the gate so he met her. He wasn\u2019t sure about coming back in yet so I rotated Lola in and let Traveler aka Tiger, Sebastian, Reese out. Another good meet. \nSo after getting kennel all cleaned up and fresh bedding n toys I worked on getting him back inside. Oh he wanted to so bad but in about 10-15 minutes he was in. Lots of praises for being such a good boy!  Progress slowly but surely. It\u2019s a good start for the New Year.\nWe are only trying to make a guess on his breeds.\nHis adoption fee is $150 which will include his vetting.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, we encourage you to fill out our adoption questionnaire at http://members.petfinder.com/~MS72/adoption_app.html\n\nSave 1 Pet is a 501 (c) 3 approved charity committed to helping homeless animals.  We don't have a facility (shelter) but work out of our homes to foster the animals until they find a forever home.\n\nPlease be advised that for all adoptions, we will conduct reference checks, including veterinary references.  Our adoption fee for dogs includes spay/neuter, heart worm check, current vaccines, microchip, worming and heart worm/flea/tick prevention.\nFor dog adoptions, we do conduct fence verification.\nWhen adopting an animal, you will be asked to complete our Adoption Contract",

We have very selective hearing.\n\nI'm a sweet girl who is a bit reserved and cautious when meeting new people.  I do warm up quicker to women than men. The volunteers at AGPR have helped me learn that it is ok to trust other people and I'm getting better at it.  Slowly but surely.  \n\nI recently spent a little time with a foster dad and he let me get up on his bed to relax.  I enjoyed that but found that the floor was a much cooler place to \"chill\".  I ride well in a car and enjoy taking walks.  I do pull a little - I think that is part of my nervousness when meeting new people.  But I love to run and play in the yard,\n\nThe volunteers continue to tell me I am a very pretty girl.  They say I have \"maybelline eyeliner\" and silver tipped ears.  They are so nice to me!\n\nI'm not a city girl.  I'd really like to be in a calm home with a nice yard and an understanding neighborhood.  I will bark at strangers because it is my job to protect you and our property.\n\nOne last thing - I was in a home for a little while with cats and I DO NOT LIKE CATS.  Sorry...but it is important for anyone thinking of adopting me to know that.\n\nAll Great Pyrenees require a fenced-in yard (at least four foot high). If you have questions about the breed or our adoption policies and procedures, please go to our website at www.agprescue.org.  There's plenty of good information about the breed on our website - Pyrs aren't a breed for everyone!\n\nOur adoption application is online: http://agprescue.org/adoption-application/agpr-application-donations/  Please note that we are a small regional rescue organization.  We will consider adopting to families within a four to five hour drive to Richmond, VA",

            "description": "Kiwi is a lovely little girl weighing in at 26 pounds and is estimated to be 9 years old. She\u2019s completely up to date on her vaccines, heartworm and lymes negative, and spayed. Kiwi did have a rough upbringing, as she came from a hoarding situation where SWCHS had picked up 79 dogs in total. Because of this, she is not trusting of many humans, but does well with other dogs and even cats! Kiwi would do best in a home with only one other dog and calm cats, as she does like her space from other animals.\n\nWhen Kiwi does choose a human she likes, she is their shadow and wants to be with them all the time. She loves to cuddle and be a lap dog, and is generally interested in everything her human is doing. She\u2019s partially house broken, and walks amazing on leash. She\u2019s not a very energetic girl in her older years, so playing is not a frequent thing for her. \n\nThe best home for Kiwi would be a quiet one without any children, and only one person living in it. Realistically, having company over would not be an option.  Kiwi is very scared of new people, and does negatively react to any person (that isn't her owner) coming into her space. Due to this, during an initial meet and greet if Kiwi does not immediately make a connection, it is unlikely she will develop one over time. \n\nAny meet and greets will be done at the potential adopter\u2019s residency, and cannot be more than a 35 minute drive from SWCHS. We will not be accepting any applications that do not meet the specific requirements for her adoption. If you believe that you have the correct home and lifestyle that Kiwi requires, please apply online today at www.swchs.com",

She was running a fever and couldn't get her rabies vaccine just yet.  She has started doxycycline for her first part of heartworm treatment for 30 days and this hopefully will help with her infection as well.\nHer spay is set up for February 2nd.  No more puppies for her. \nShe is sweet and will blossom now that she doesn\u2019t have to worry about her last two pups. She\u2019s in a foster home and adjusting fairly well.  Amber has not been around any children yet but seems fine with other dogs.\nAvailable for adoption. \n*****If interested please complete the adoption application on our website. \nwww.save1pet.org. Scroll down to application. \nMust be local to our area (Olive Branch, Ms near Memphis, Tn) to complete her vetting. \nAdoption fee is $150 includes spay, adult vaccine, microchip, worming and her heartworm treatment.\n\nSave 1 Pet is a 501 (c) 3 approved charity committed to helping homeless animals.  We don't have a facility (shelter) but work out of our homes to foster the animals until they find a forever home.\n\nPlease be advised that for all adoptions, we will conduct reference checks, including veterinary references.  Our adoption fee for dogs includes spay/neuter, heart worm check, current vaccines, microchip, worming and heart worm/flea/tick prevention.\nFor dog adoptions, we do conduct fence verification.\nWhen adopting an animal, you will be asked to complete our Adoption Contract",

            "description": "Ace is a 1-2 yr old Heeler mix. He comes when called but does not stay close to his person without interaction. He likes to give gentle chin nudges and kisses. Ace is high energy so he would need plenty of playtime and exercise. He pulls on a leash but with some basic obedience training, this could easily be resolved. He is food motivated. He knows the sit command. Ace is not a fan of cats in a shelter atmosphere. Dogs are generally tested with dogs of their own size; and dog meets with the resident dogs are always encouraged. Dogs are generally tested with dogs of their own size; and dog meets with the resident dogs are always encouraged. Our cat test should be used as a general purpose screening only to rule out overt aggression; we always recommend caution when introducing dogs to cats in the home. Recommendation on suitability of placement with children by their ages is based on behavioral observations including energy level and response to body handling. We never recommend leaving young children unsupervised with dogs, and we cannot guarantee the behavior of dogs with children, other pets or cats. Behavior evaluations should be considered as a snapshot of the behavior of the dog at this point in time; JHS believes all dog families need to be prepared to invest time and energy into training as well as provide common sense management of their new dog. We always encourage family to do some research on the breeds or mixes of breeds prior to adoption as many can have some unique characteristics that may or may not fit into their families. Always remember that the majority of dogs at our shelter have been exposed to or may have kennel cough. Kennel cough is contagious to other dogs, please talk to your vet if you have any questions about kennel cough prior to adoption. Please ask your adoption counselor at time of adoption if you have any unanswered questions regarding illnesses and treatments of the path that you are adopting. For more information about this dog or any others at our Shelter, please visit www.joplinhumane.org. We are the Joplin Humane Society in Joplin, Missouri. 417-623-3642",

            "description": "Looking for a bonded pair of boys with lots of energy and full of silly antics?  Well, you're looking at them.  My name is Walter and my brother is Argie.  I am the handsome boy with black tipped ears and Argie is the good looking guy with the big smile.  He is such a ham - he sees a camera and lights up like a super model.  His smile is so big that his ears have to get out of the way!  You can see from the photos that I can be serious or show my charming personality when the paparazzi show up.\n\nSince we were turned in to a shelter, our friends at AGPR don't know much about us.  We aren't telling them our age but they are correct when they say that we are \"about two years old\" (and we act it).  Since we are big and energetic, we suggest that there be no young kids in the household...we'd probably knock them over again and again and again.  We have not been tested with cats, but if it runs, we'll chase.  Its like Tag, right?\n\nPlease, if you live in a city environment, we aren't the right dogs for you.  We need some room to run and play and bark.  And we could use a forever home with someone who is willing to teach us some manners.  It is believed that we did not have much \"parental guidance\" in our formative.  But we are getting better!\n\nWe do prefer to be adopted together.  We were separated once for a week and Argie was not happy and kept trying to make his way back to me and I was depressed and cried.  I know, not very manly, but I missed him...alot!\n\nAll Great Pyrenees require a securely fenced-in yard (at least four foot high).  Depending on what kind of fencing you have, we may need a five foot fence. If you have questions about the breed or our adoption policies and procedures, please go to our website at www.agprescue.org.  There's plenty of good information about the breed on our website - Pyrs aren't a breed for everyone!\n\nOur adoption application is online: http://agprescue.org/adoption-application/agpr-application-donations/  Please note that we are a small regional rescue organization.  We will consider adopting to families within a four to five hour drive to Richmond, VA",

Domino is maybe around three years old, maybe younger, and around eight pounds.  He's probably a Jack Russell mixed with Chihuhuahua, but here he got his snaggle-toothed grin is beyond us.  \n\nScared as can be is how we found him at a shelter - too afraid to move a muscle and eyes that looked like they were going to pop right out of his head.  But it only took about five minutes for him to lie back, relax, and accept belly rubs.  In his foster home he has blossomed and become more and more confident, coming to be picked up and loved on.  Because of how scared he was we can only assume new people will need to give him a chance to warm up and may even experience his bug-eyes at first too, so he'll need patient people.\n\nDomino has learned to love a crate and doesn't make a peep the whole night through.  He would do best in a new home if his people will continue to provide him that safe-haven while acclimating to a new environment.  He is not great on leash yet but it won't take long (thought he seems like he will be a dog whose idea of a walk is being carried).  Children 13 or older would be best as anything unpredictable will spook him.  He does get along with other small dogs but most large dogs give him a start so slow introductions or a home without any large dogs would be best.  Cats are okay and could probably scare the bejeevies out of him if they tried.  \n\nIf you have been looking for a small dog that truly is quiet and just wants to be loved and feel secure then this guy is the guy for you.  Read on or go directly to the adoption process page of our website, throwmeabonedogrescue.org.\n\nAll potential adopters are expected to complete an application and provide pictures of their yard, patio, and/or balcony making sure we can see the fence line and/or railing.  The application can be completed and submitted from our website - throwmeabonedogrescue.org - the link is found of the Adoption Process page.  Applications will be reviewed for approval before setting an appointment to come meet and possibly adopt the dog of interest.  In addition, those who live in a rental property are expected to provide proof that they are allowed to have a dog where they live.\n\nEach of our rescued dogs has been de-wormed if necessary, de-flea'd (with topical treatment if old enough, and by medicated bath if too young), spayed/neutered, microchipped, is up to date on shots, and has been fully examined by a veterinarian.  In addition, each adopted dog comes with a starter baggie of the food it has been eating, a few treats for training purposes, a rawhide chew, a lead and collar, and a folder containing pertinent records.",

            "description": "Meet BG, a 7 yr old dalmatian mix rescued from a small shelter in Kern County.  She currently lives in a foster home with multiple dogs and gets along with everyone, big and small.  She even passed the cat test. She loves to play chase, especially when she's the one with the toy or the rope being chased!  She is a well behaved girl except for her counter surfing so some training on that, or blocking off the kitchen to her access, would be best .. she does love to eat!  She is very much a dalmatian in nature, very velcro, loves to be close, loves to touch and be touched by her 2 legged and 4 legged foster family.  She would be the perfect pup in a more low key home, calm and well behaved and always close by. She loves other dogs so would enjoy a multiple dog home but she does love her 2 legged foster family best and as long as she could be with her people, she'd be one happy girl.  She is spayed, vaccinated and microchipped so she's ready to go home any time the right home comes along.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Ms. BG, please email Dalmatian Rescue of Southern California, Inc. at dalrescue@sbcglobal.net and provide your email so an adoption questionnaire can be emailed to you  You should also be able to access the questionnaire on line from the Dalmatian Rescue website homepage, www.dalrescuesocal.com.  Once the questionnaire has been completed and returned, and if it looks like BG might be a good fit for you and your family, a \"meet and greet\" can be quickly set up so you and your family and other dogs, can meet BG and see if there's a connection. She adores her foster family but would so love having a family of her own to love.\n\nTo learn more about Dalmatian Rescue of Southern California, Inc., a 501 c3 non profit charity, and to see all of our available dogs, please visit our website at www.dalrescuesocal.com.  You can also visit us on facebook at www.facebook.com/spottyfriends.  We love seeing posts and photos of life with your spotty (and unspotty) friends so please, keep them coming.  Thanks!",

            "description": "Jackson is a young 1.5-2 year old American Bulldog/Boxer mix. He is full of energy and personality. Jackson struggles with stranger danger and it takes a little while to warm up some humans but once he does he offers a lifetime of love and devotion. He loves cuddles and attention from the humans he trusts. Jackson is crate trained, house trained and knows basic commands like sit, stay, shake, watch and down. Jackson walks well on a leash but can pull occasionally. He has training in loose leash walking and meeting strangers. He will need a dedicated owner to reinforce these skills. Jackson loves treats and will do anything for cheese! Jackson does well with other dogs, but can be nervous around new people. He loves to play and would be best suited in a home with another well adjusted energetic adult dog. He may be able to live with cats but he will have to be introduced properly and monitored closely at first. Jackson would prefer a home with either no children or older children who can be respectful of him.\n\nIf you are interested in this pup, please fill out our foster/adoption application here: https://form.jotform.com/92587410679166 and someone will be in touch with you shortly!",

Their owner could no longer keep them in her apartment and refused to give them to the shelter. They are very nervous dogs at first and a very scared of men (they were never around one). Roxy comes out of her shell faster then Libby and Libby growls as her way of talking. The first step in adopting an animal is to fill out the application. For an application please see our website www.tanyasinc.org and download an application and e-mail it to us. All dogs are spayed/neutered, current on vaccinations, dewormed, and are treated with advantix for fleas and ticks. They are also micro chipped(transfer of registration to your name is $20.00). With every adoption you will also receive coupons from PETCO.The best way to get ahold of us is to e-mail Tanya at tanyasinc@msn.com",

Super sweet little boy with a great personality. Would make a good lap dog or walking partner. --\n\nWhere did he come from: He was surrendered to the neighbor who in turn surrendered him to us. Thankfully the neighbor stepped up to save this boy!\n\nAdoption: ***** $541.25 Includes Required Tax *****\nWeight: 9.6 lbs.\nApproximate age: 12/14/2018\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION: http://www.recycledpoms.org/application --\n\nEmail info@recycledpomeranians.com to request a printable application. --\n\n------Please remember our group is made of only volunteers all of whom have full time jobs, foster fur-kids, and families of their own, so please be patient.--------",

            "description": "Meet Mama Ambrosia! Here is her story.\nAmbrosia was found running on a person's property very underweight and very pregnant. She came into rescue and our transporters thought she was in labor because she was so pregnant. Her foster mom kept a close eye on her for 7 days with no babies. On the 8th day, they decided it was time. She began labor in the morning however after several hours of labor and pushing it was clear something was wrong. A trip to Blue Pearl was taken to realize one of the babies was stuck in the birth canal. The vets gave her some meds to help her and she finally delivered her first puppy. That puppy unfortunately didn't make it. She delivered her second one there and it was healthy. So her foster mom took her home and she delivered 6 more babies throughout the night. Unfortunately another one passed but the other six were healthy. Sometimes we do not know these pups stories before being rescued and we don't know why certain babies do not make it. Fast forward a few weeks and this girl was being a wonderful mama to her babies. She did amazing. Now those babies are 11 weeks old and all went to their forever homes this weekend. Now it is her turn. Ambrosia is a lover, cuddler and just a all around good girl. She is fine with cats (with proper introduction, She lived with two in her foster home and was fine with them). She loves people, kids and other dogs. She wants to be a lap dog and although she is not a huge girl she is solid!!! She walks great on a leash. She can chew up a toy in seconds! Ambrosia is hoping to find her forever home with someone who will cuddle her, play with her and just love her. Think you want to give this girl a chance?? Apply today!\n\nAmbrosia is up to date on age appropriate vaccines, dewormed, current on preventatives, heartworm negative, spayed and microchipped. Her adoption fee is $150. Just fill out an application to meet her at www.pawsitivetailskc.org!",

            "description": "Meet Harvey! We believe this exuberant guy is 2-3 years old and a pit bull terrier mix. He's a fast learner, getting used to walking on a leash. Harvey picked up sit in just three days and is on his way to learning paw! He is house trained, crate trained, and is happy to hang out while you're working from home. He is also neutered.\n\nHarvey is good with other dogs (both bigger and smaller), and ready to find his forever home. Is that home yours?\n\nIf you are interested in adding this pup to your family, please submit an application at www.petrescuealliance.com. All questions will be answered and meet and greets set up following a review of application. If the dog is listed on our website or Petfinder, they are still available!

I sure do love meeting new people, even though I am a little nervous at first, I warm up very fast.\n\nI love to sit in your lap or be held in your arms and soak up all the affection I can get. The smaller version of you guys are my favorite, I love running to their room and playing with them.\n\nOther doggy friends are great too! I even like kitty friends, but sometimes I am too playful for them.\n\nAt night I love getting under a soft blanket in my kennel, it is where I eat too and it is my safe spot. I am very playful and love to play chase or play with toys.\n\nMy foster family has done a great job but now I am ready for my furever home,",

She is a fun, active girl with an with outgoing personality and such a cute face.  Winnie is 9-11 mo old about 24 lbs, with a petite build and long legs. She  is great with other dogs, fine with  inside cats (might chase outdoor cats) and older kids. While she very lovable and sweet, she does have a bit of stubborn side too.  Winnie is easy to please and would leap tall buildings for a treat.  Our girl needs  a home with a fence and doggy playmate  as she likes to stay busy.  Her new person/family will need to continue working with her with commands and better manners as obviously she never had any training prior to coming to us. Currently, she is house and crate trained and does okay on a leash.  She would be  perfect for someone who is active and likes to walk and hike but loves to snuggle too. \n\nTo meet and  possibly adopt our  sweet girl, please visit our website and fill out an application at www.littleraysofsunshineanimalrescue.org Winnie's adoption fee is $350.  \n",

She was very scared and could not be leashed. Luckily, we were able to enlist the help of another rescue who had a live trap. We were quickly able to trap her and take her in to the vet. There is a possibility that this little girl may be pregnant, which would explain her aversion to people. Once she got settled in her new warm crate, she did warm up quickly.\nWe are looking for a foster to take this beautiful girl so she can fully decompress. There is also a chance she may be pregnant; we'll know if a few more weeks. if you would like to foster her or foster to adopt this maybe momma please apply at Busterdogs.com.",

Her foster mom describes her as being SO SMART, sweet and a gorgeous athlete.  She runs, hops and floats when she\u2019s in the backyard.  She loves tennis balls and will entertain herself with them.  Since she is a Standard Poodle, their breed tends to be highly intelligent and she requires exercise and mental stimulation with toys.\n\nPrincess does well on walks but does have a high prey drive so when she sees bunnies and squirrels, she will try and chase them.  Princess hasn\u2019t had any accidents since arriving at her foster home, she is not destructive, loves her dog bed, and has free roam of the house.\n\nHer only \u201cvice\u201d is counter surfing, not for food necessarily but anything of interest to her.  Princess has a cute trick, when you say \u201cCheese\u201d she will give you a toothy smile from the left side of her mouth when she\u2019s happy to see you.\n\nPrincess will need to be adopted with Buck, a 95-pound Golden Retriever, they are a bonded pair and Princess takes the lead on most things and Buck follows her.  \n\nTheir forever home cannot have other dogs as Buck is fearful of dogs he doesn\u2019t know. They both have a high prey drive, so they require a physical fence and cannot live with cats. \n\nTo learn more about Princess and to read her latest updates, you can see her bio at: https://ragom.org/dogs/princess-20-188\n\nPlacement Requirements:\nGood With Dogs: With Buck\nGood With Cats: No\nGood With Kids: 13+\nFence: Physical fence required\nAge: 8 years old\n\nIf you are interested in any of the dogs available at Retrieve a Golden of the Midwest (RAGOM), you can read our adoption process and apply to adopt, which can be found at: https://ragom.org/our-adoption-process.",

            "description": "Hi there! I'm Howie and I'm a 6 year old, 50 lb Aussie Shepherd/Chow mix. My human dad passed away and I spent 6 months in the shelter before the HIT Living  brought me in. I am an incredibly sweet, smart, sensitive and loving boy looking to spend the rest of my life with my forever person!!! \n\n- I am the BEST doggo: loyal, loving, affectionate, mild mannered, obedient and friendly! \n\n- My foster mom believes that my previous owner who passed, was connected to machines that beeped and I am forever traumatized by that. Every time something beeps whether it be a rice cooker, oven, or the laundry machine, I cry or bark. To calm me down, my foster mom calls me over, hugs me like a little baby and I cry in her arms while she tells me its ok. I then forget what just happened because I\u2019m so glad to be getting pets and move on with my life! \n\n- I can be completely trusted when left alone! When my foster mom has to leave me, all of my foster siblings go in crates except for me because I\u2019m the best boy that doesn\u2019t chew or get into anything. I take a nap or work for hours to get that peanut butter out of that red thing, and it's all I need :) \n\n- The brown tears under my eyes remain a conundrum for my foster mom. The vet thinks its allergies but we\u2019ve tried many different types of foods and I recently was put on probiotics and those seem to be helping! I will need to be on probiotics for the rest of my life which is a low cost my foster mom says! Don\u2019t let those tears keep you from swiping next, I am handsome and when I look up for a treat I look like a puppy teddy bear!!! \n\n- I am an excellent sleeper and sleep on a dog bed next to my foster moms bed. I also do not jump on any furniture like my crazy foster siblings do, unless invited of course!\n\n- My favorite things to do are go for walks, get pets (I\u2019m still uncertain about belly rubs but behind my ears and my butt are my sweet spots, I also love nose kisses) chew on antlers, and just be by my person. I also love to walk right in-between my human's knees and wait for all the back and butt scratches they give me!\n\n- I love car rides and if it weren\u2019t too extreme, my foster thinks I would be a great camping dog!  \n\n- I have one hind hip that is smaller than the other and that limits me to walks only (and who doesn\u2019t love a good walk on the beach!). While I may never be able to handle hikes or jogs, I LOVE walks and my foster mom says I walk very well on a leash! I also know all my basic commands and am fully house trained. \n\n- I have foster siblings big and small and get along with them all. While I go to the dog park and doggie day care sometimes with my foster siblings (I mostly tend to keep to myself in these places), I would prefer to be an only dog and the center of someone\u2019s world like I once was with my previous human. Even if I would never be resource guarding, my foster mom can see the sadness in my eyes when she is petting the other dogs because I am longing for that one on one attention all for myself. \n\n- Something must have happened to me when I was a little pup because I do NOT like being surprised from behind. Whether someone starts petting me from behind or brushing me without me knowing they are there, I can get really startled and snap back. That being said, I would do best in a home with no children ages 0 - 17 as they can be unpredictable, and whoever adopts me just needs to know to let me know they are there before touching me :) \n\n- Due to my Chow nature, I can be a bit mouthy when I get excited. A lot of people would mistake this for biting, but I would never bite too hard. That is just really how I express my excitement! \n\n- At my current foster home I go on 2 walks a day, to the dog park 3 days a week and doggie day care 2 days a week. Despite the disability with my hip, I live an active lifestyle and would like to remain as active as I am now, even if that\u2019s multiple walks per day! \n\n- My ideal is home is with one or two adults that live an easy lifestyle, have no other dogs (or cats, I get really excited around cats and for some reason, they\u2019re not as excited to see me), no young children, and a home where humans are around for most of the day or one where I can be brought to work. I do great meeting adult strangers and would make a great work dog as I would need a few potty breaks but happy to be laying by my person\u2019s feet as they work. \n\n- I have been with my foster mom and dad for so long now, I would prefer time to get to know someone by having a few dates before I make the commitment for a full sleep over. If you\u2019re patient and up for dating before we make it official, our love could last the rest of my lifetime!!! \n\nIf you see me online I am still available for adoption! If you are interested in adopting me please fill out an application here: www.hitlivingfoundation.org/adoption-application, and email a video walkthrough of your home and yard to BOTH Nicole@hitlivingfoundation.org AND Marta@hitlivingfoundation.org.

As you can see from the photograph, I look a little different from ordinary dogs. According to my foster family, I am a lot more special than ordinary dogs! It makes me blush to admit this, but my foster family says that I am bright and bubbly and bouncy. I enjoy spending time with both people and pups. I love toys! Playful and enthusiastic, I am able to get around on my two strong back legs better than some dogs can get around on their four good ones!\nMy doctor has recommended that I wait until I've grown into my big feet before being fitted for a prosthetic so I would ask you to please consider this should your heart yearn to make me a part of your family. In case you're wondering,\n\nI get my good looks from my mom who was a beautiful German Shepherd mix and dad, that rapscallion, must have been pretty fuzzy and furry himself. I can't wait to meet the loving, patient family who is willing to find room in their hearts and home for me.",

He is a sweet, loving boy who his foster mom describes as a \u201cpuddle of love\u201d.  He loves sleeping in his dog bed, he is not destructive and has free roam of the house.  He has yet to have an accident in his foster home.  He has learned how to walk nicely on a leash and his foster family is working on getting some excess weight off of him.\n\nSince Buck spent most of his 7 years in a kennel he can be a bit weary of new people and needs a slow and quiet introduction which is why kids in his fur-ever home should be at least 13 years old and on the quiet side, without a lot of visiting friends.  \n\nBuck will need to be adopted with Princess, a 48-pound Standard Poodle, they are a bonded pair and Princess gives Buck his extra boost of confidence when he\u2019s hesitant about something new. \n\nTheir forever home cannot have other dogs as Buck is fearful of dogs he doesn\u2019t know. They both have a high prey drive, so they require a physical fence and cannot live with cats. \n\nTo learn more about Buck and to read his latest updates, you can see his bio at: https://ragom.org/dogs/buck-20-187\n\nPlacement Requirements:\nGood With Dogs: With Princess\nGood With Cats: No\nGood With Kids: 13+\nFence: Physical fence required\nAge: 7 years old\n\nIf you are interested in any of the dogs available at Retrieve a Golden of the Midwest (RAGOM), you can read our adoption process and apply to adopt, which can be found at: https://ragom.org/our-adoption-process. \n",

            "description": "There's no place like home...and Dorothy can't wait to get there! This beautiful gal has had a long journey on her way to her very own Kansas, but it's finally time for her happy ending! Dorothy is a beautiful 2 year old German Shepherd/hound mix who arrived at CCR with her siblings and parents from a shelter in Texas. Dorothy most likely spent her early months in a shelter with her canine family but not a lot of human interaction, so we sent her to foster to learn how to be a pet. Dorothy has simply BLOSSOMED! She started as a super scared dog who didn't want to be touched and now she's a friendly, goofy, playful, affectionate gal who LOVES her canine foster siblings, avoids her feline foster siblings, and ADORES all of the humans she meets. Dorothy has truly come into her own, and she's ready to find a home that will help keep up all the progress she's made.\n\nTo be happy and successful, Dorothy needs three things - 1) a friendly dog sibling who wants to play, snuggle, and frolic with her, 2) a spacious fenced in yard where she can party and have fun as she continues to practice leash walking, and 3) a crate because she loves her crate! We're fully expecting Dorothy to take a couple of days to adjust and acclimate to a new home, but based on how successful she was in her foster home, we're 100% confident that a few days of feeling it out and getting to know her new family will be all it takes! Dorothy is learning to walk on a leash and she's enjoying it more every day, She loves to romp in the yard and then beg for all the snuggles afterward. She's a real snuggle hog! She may enjoy dog daycare, dog parks, and other places where she can have fun with pups! Dorothy is great with kitties - she avoids the tough ones and happily co-exists with the friendly ones. Because she'll need a bit more time than usual to adapt to a new home, she'd prefer older kids and adults who can give her patience and space.\n\nDorothy truly has gone from a life of black and white to TECHNICOLOR! Come join in her rainbow!\n\nTo meet Dorothy, please submit an application at chicagocaninerescue.org.",

While we don't know anything about her past from the behavior she has shown us we think she would be great in ANY home- kids, cats, other dogs- you name it! She is still active and puppy playful so she will need a home with the time and patience to finish up her basic training and to give her TONS of play time! Her adoption fee is $295 and that includes she is spayed, microchipped, and up to date with flea/tick treatments and heartworm preventative.

She is housetrained and respectful of the home, and is trusted with the majority of the house while her foster is at work. Stella is a low energy dog inside. Stella lives for belly rubs and dinner. She gets so excited for dinner that she respectfully dances every single night while it is served.\n\nStella was never socialized and has been in training for the past six months and has been doing well. She is leash reactive but is trained not to be, her new owners will need to continue her training in this area. Stella will require an hour to an hour and a half mentally stimulating walk daily. Stella is very intelligent, highly motivated by food, and very eager to please.\n\nStella is very wary of strange/new people and dogs. She requires proper careful introductions to both. For this reason, prospective adopters should have a safe place for her to stay in when guests are over. She is muzzled trained. Stella would do well with one or two similar sized well behaved dogs however other dogs are not required. Due to her prey drive she requires a home free of cats and small animals. Stella has bitten a home intruder before. Once trust has been established this dog is an absolute blessing to have in your life. Stellas foster will work with her adopters to ensure a smooth home transition.",

Small animals also get confused for toys because they are just so similar! I would probably do best in a home that does not have small children but I would be an excellent pick for a first-time adopter. I could see myself living in a home or an apartment and I would love to live a quiet lifestyle with my new family. I give off the most wonderful loving vibe and am just an all around great dog. I've got medium energy and a playful vibe so I would be happy running around and playing outside with older children, or just chilling on the couch with my new parents. I have a lot to learn as far as when and where to go potty and how to walk on a leash, but I'd learn anything to make you happy. While I am not potty-trained yet, I do keep my kennel very neat and I think I could master it in no time. I love balls and toys and fetch is my favorite game. I hope I'm cute enough to be your newest family member!",

            "special_needs_notes": "DOBBIE - UPDATE 1/29/2021:\nThree year old Dobbie is still waiting for his forever home!! \nDobbie is our gentle giant who is nearly blind due to PRA (progressive retinal atrophy, which is the degeneration of the retina, causing progressive vision loss culminating in blindness.) Once he knows his way around the environment, he navigates quite well. New places, new people, and other dogs need a slow, gentle introduction, as he can get startled easily. Dogs that come at him barking or lunging cause him great distress, making him feel the need to protect himself!  In general he is very easy going, though when in the vicinity of cats, he goes on high alert, so cats would definitely not be a good fit!!   While Weimaraners are known for being highly energetic and requiring lots of exercise, Dobbie is more sedate in character and overall doesn't require the level of exercise typical of the breed. He is crate trained and house broken, and fine to travel, or spend a little time alone in the securely fenced yard.  But he does love long walks on the leash, currently doing about two miles per day.  Dobbie would probably do best as an only dog in a household with family members who are sensitive to the need for him to be able to navigate without obstacles! If you would like to know more about Dobbie, contact us:  twcrescue@aol.com",

She will nudge your hand if you stop petting her and so badly wants to cuddle on a comfy bed with her people. She is hesitant to trust new people but time is the true way to her heart. She enjoys playing with toys and going for long walks. She is very smart and very driven and would greatly benefit from continued training in a home. She struggles with some anxiety so an understanding home, dedicated to working on that would be great for her! Posey loves to work and to please her people, she would make a great companion pet.

            "description": "Name: Ellie \n\nSex: Female \n \nColor: Black and white\n \nEye Color: Blue\n \nBirthday: 11/22/19 estimated \n \nWeight: 49 lbs\n \nLarge Dog Friendly: Yes, does well at dog park\n \nSmall Dog Friendly: Yes, no problems at all\n \nCat Friendly: No \n\nCrate Trained: Unknown. We haven't needed to crate her as we are retired and rarely leave the house...we will try when we get a chance.\n \nHousebroken: Yes, no accidents at all so far! She is also outside a lot.\n \nEnergy Level: Medium high to high. She's a youngster! Loves to play!\n \nReaction to New People: She loves everybody so far...does tend to jump up on people, working on that.\n \nKid Friendly: Yes, doesn't jump up on smaller kids so far.\n \nTraining: Will eventually sit for a treat, comes pretty well when called we are working on that. Walking on leash involves a lot of sniffing and some pulling, but she does really well passing other dogs - even dogs barking in the yards we walk past.\n\nGrooming Needs: Shorter coat stays pretty nice! Likes to dig once in awhile so dirty paws, but they clean up fast.\n\nFence: Has not tried to go over fence but will jump up on it to look at squirrels nearby. She DOES know how to open fence latches and lever door handles so a lock is needed on fence latch and locking of outside doors. She's a smarty pants :) \n\nSolo or Siblings: She has 3 foster siblings and she really enjoys their company! Would probably do best with another dog in the home\n\nFrom the Foster: Ellie is such a sweetheart! She loves to play and run and is definitely a squirrel watcher. She loves her foster dad and when he leaves she does a whiny/crabby talking/howling combo thing that is precious and hilarious. She is a little awkward at times, not quite making it onto the bed or falling off the couch, and coming full speed running onto the deck and nearly sliding off of it! Plenty of energy, daily dog parks and playdates are needed. She likes her toys and chewie things but isn't aggressive at at guarding them. There have been a couple small spats at first but no problems lately - they've figured each other out. We are working on not being so nosy at the people's foods. She takes treats very gently and will eat ice for treats occassionally with our Echo. She is very good at bedtime, goes to bed when we do - sleeps on our family room couch with her puppy toy that she often uses for a pillow. Sometimes will sleep on the bed in the early morning. Doesn't wake you up too early to go potty or want to go outside in the middle of the night either. She is an absolute gem! Very sweet and lovable, loves pets and belly rubs!\n\nAdoption Fee: $400\n\nAll dogs coming into Adopt a Husky Minnesota receive care tailored to their needs, including: Nose-to-tail exam with a partner veterinarian, Vaccinations (Rabies, Distemper, Bordetella), 4DX test to check for heartworm or tick exposure, Fecal Analysis, Heartworm and Flea/Tick Preventative, Spay/Neuter prior to adoption, Microchip, and are evaluated for temperament and trainability.",

He is crate trained and will cry from the crate if he has to go out, but is still working on housetraining. He does well with other dogs, cats and kids, although he does need to work on not jumping.\n\nWe are looking for an active home for him, someone who knows the breed, has another dog in the home (bonus for another dobi) and has a fenced in yard for him. If you do not meet these requirements your app will not be approved for a meet and greet. Also, he is not a dog meant for an apartment.\n\nHe is fully vetted (dewormed, core vaccines, bordetella, microchipped, neutered, on heartworm prevention and on flea prevention) and his adoption fee is $400.\n\nTo apply you must submit an app at www.islanddogrescue.net. All updates can be found on our Facebook Page at \"Island Dog International Dog Rescue.\" If you are reading this profile he is still available and again to be considered you must submit an app, as we are extremely busy at the moment and cannot reply to emails or inquires sent.",

Gatsby was one of 27 Weimaraners that GLWR took in from a seizure case in northern Michigan in November. All of these dogs have been in foster care for about 2 months. They are learning everyday - food bowls, leashes, toys and beds are all new experiences. Gatsby had a huge tumor the size of a small melon removed from his shoulder in late November. He has recovered beautifully. Rumor has it that he's been bragging and showing off his scar in the local dog park! Gatsby's Foster Mom Mary says \"Gatsby loves walks and going getting pets when he goes to our local brew pubs. We didn't order him his own growler of craft beer but he did have a sip of my husband's pint! Gatsby enjoys having warm soft things to wear and play with; he really enjoys wearing a sweater. Gatsby's favorite toy to play with his his Bark Broccoli. Gatsby does not chew except for paper. He loved shredding his Christmas present paper, and then we discovered he shredded other papers that we left out by mistake. Its all gray to him. Gatsby likes to go hiking on trails, but can be fearful of other dogs. He is treat motivated and I believe training will give him some confidence. Gatsby loves sleeping in a human bed. He crates when he is home alone, but would prefer to free roam.\" Gatsby is healthy and ready to find his forever home.",

Ms Izzy is exactly what you would expect a well-bred shepherd pup to be, wide open, full of life, inquisitive, happy, loving, smart and begging to train. This girl presently 52 pounds but judging from her build I would say that she will weigh 90-95 pounds as an adult. Izzy has great symmetry, perfect stride, gorgeous coat and a powerful, athletic, muscular frame. \n\nOur girl has passed all of our socialization and training programs, revealing a strong people drive, a strong affinity for training, high intelligence and a great social understanding with other dogs. If you have time and patience for a German shepherd puppy you not find a better example of the breed.\n\n<strong>About Our Rescue</strong>\n\nWhether you adopt through Rescue Dog Village Guardian, Inc A 5013c Non-Profit Organization or any other similar organization, the LEAST we can do is thank you from the bottom of our hearts for considering welcoming these deserving dogs into your hearts and home. One of our favorite sayings is \"RESCUE IS THE BEST BREED,\" and we believe that wholeheartedly. Help us help these dogs and submit your application today! We appreciate that you want to help make a difference in the lives of dogs who need us most!!! RESCUE ROCKS!\n\n<b><i>Disclaimer: Please note that the breeds posted on our dogs' biographies are our best guess based on years of working with rescue dogs. Adopters who need to know the exact breed or mix of breeds of a particular dog must have the dog's DNA tested at their own expense.</i></b>\n\n<center><b>To see more photos of this dog and all our adoptable dogs,<br>please check out our website at <a href=\"http://rescuedogvillage.com\" target=\"_blank\">Rescue Dog Village</a></b>.</center>\n\nRESCUE DOG VILLAGE GUARDIAN, INC A 5013C NON-PROFIT ORGAINZATION WEBSITE: WWW.RESCUEDOGVILLAGE.COM\n\nOUR DOGS ARE MICRO-CHIPPED AND READY TO BE PART OF YOUR FAMILY TODAY!\n\nThese dogs deserve all of our attention, and in Rescue Dog Village Guardian, Inc A 5013c Non-Profit Organization, we are committed to our adopters and our dogs equally. We offer full disclosure and hope to make the best matches possible. Please know our adoption fees never cover our expenses. We rely on the generosity of our adopters and supporters to help us help the dogs. \n\nOur rescue is only in the business of offering full disclosure to adopters, and expects and hopes to engage your questions and concerns fully. We owe it to the dogs we rescue and all the wonderful families/adopters who might consider welcoming our charges into their hearts and home. Our dogs are waiting for that ideal forever home where they will be cherished as deserving family members. It's sad these second chances are even necessary for these dogs, but we are committed to them and will devote the time and energy to their re-homing, and not just move them to save more dogs. We diligently and responsibly seek good matches, as we don't want to re-home the dog again. These animals have already endured more than they should have, and through no fault of their own. It behooves us to be honest and forthright, and we appreciate the same in return from applicants. It's that winning combination of reciprocal trust and respect that allows for successful placements to be made. Happy adopters translate to happy dogs, and that's our goal! \n",

            "description": "Meet Titan! Titan was rescued off the streets as a puppy, found next to his mamma who had been poisoned. He is now about 8 years old, and loves to meet all people including kids although he may be a bit much for smaller children as he weighs around 95lbs. He needs a proper introduction to any new dogs he meets, and sharing a home with smaller dogs, cats, or other animals may not be best suited for him. An ideal person or a family would be an experienced dog owner who is confident in handling dogs his size, and willing to do some training so he can be the best version of himself.

Two days later she was surrendered to the Marion-Grant County Humane Society.  Leah was confused, frightened, and scared.  It took several weeks and this lovely lady is finally out of her shell and ready to find her forever home.  Leah seems good with other dogs, wants to play so bad, is friendly and loving.  She would make a great addition to any active family.\n\nThe Marion/Grant County Humane Society encourages potential adopters to research dog breeds before adopting.  All breeds have certain care, training, working, feeding, and space needs.  Check with your local library, book store, veterinarian, or shelter for more information.  Make sure the dog you adopt will be the perfect match for your family.  \n\n    The adoption fee is $150 for puppies(less than 18 months of age), $130 for adult dogs(greater than 18 months of age), and $50 for seniors(dogs 8 years of age and older)  which includes the spay/neuter surgery, microchip, dhlppc accinations, deworming, and flea prevention.  If you are interested in adopting this animal please fill out an application, go online to  complete one at http://www.marionhumane.com/application or come in to our facility to pick one up.     \n\n    We do check all references thoroughly so please make sure all phone numbers are correct.  Applications take 5-6 days to review depending on weekends/holidays.  \n\n   Please be patient as we strive to send each of our animals to a forever home.  \n   \n     We are a non-profit, no-kill animal rescue shelter known as Marion-Grant County Humane Society and are not affiliated with Marion Animal Care and Control.",

I am 8 months old, female, bulldog mix, current on vaccinations -rabies, distemper/parvo, dewormed, spayed.\n\nSheba was brought to the shelter by an angel who rescued her from being outside, on a chain. Sheba could not be any happier, sweeter and more cheerful dog. She loves other dogs and does great around cats. Just like any other puppy, she is very affectionate and playful, but Sheba is just so special. Given where she came from, it is amazing how she came out and how incredible she is.\n\nAdoption Fee $ 475\nThis tax-deductible fee pays for the vaccinations, spay/neuter, boarding, food, and overall care of all the animals at the shelter.\n\n(*Includes spay or neuter with HHP vet. If a personal vet is preferred a partial refund will be issued. KEEP ONLY IF NOT FIXED)\n\n**If you're unable to adopt, please consider donating or volunteering your time to these deserving animals currently living at HHP. They require care and love on a daily basis, which adds up monetarily. Our shelter is funded by donations and adoption fees alone. The need is great within our community and your support matters.\n\nIf you have questions, please stop by any day between 1pm-6pm. Contact our office at (406) 896-1700 or Angie (406) 860-8735.",

He is very playful, he loves playing with toys and jumping up to give everyone kisses!\n\nHe likes to nudge his nose against you and pull your arm with his mouth for attention. Rover is not good on leash when seeing other dogs, he will bark and lunge at them but with proper training he will listen. He does not understand boundaries so he will need a dominate owner.\n\nHe does bark a lot when he wants something or when he\u2019s in a crate. He is a high energy dog, so he loves his walks and going for hikes. He is very smart and treat driven. He knows sit and shake a paw.\n\nPlease share to help Rover find a furever home!\n\nIf interested, please fill out an adoption application on our website at thebigdoghouseontario.com/Rover\n\nThanks,\n\nThe Big Dog House Rescue\n",

            "description": "Hello World!  My name is Duramax, but calling me Sunshine is much more appropriate.  I am a 2-year-old mixed breed male with snow white hair and adorable black spots.  My foster mom thinks I look like a fuzzy plush stuffed animal!  \n\nI LOVE LOVE LOVE toys... If it squeaks and I can chew on it - I'm a happy boy!  I love to play tug of war and fetch (sometimes I even bring it back!).  I'm not a huge fan of sharing my toys at first, but if you give me some space to trust, I will start bringing you my toys so we can play together! \nI love long walks because I enjoy new smells and new adventures.  While I'm a curious boy, I'm non-reactive on a leash when other dogs and people walk by.  I have also played with other dogs at the shelter's playgroup, so I am open to making new friends.  \n\nI'm a fun-loving boy that has a smile on my face when I wake up in the morning and when I go to bed at night.  I have a lot of energy and get the zoomies A LOT!  My dream is to have a big backyard where I can run, play and be the puppy I am. Despite never having a real home, I am very respectful in my foster home.  When left alone, I don't scratch, rip or tear anything up, and I'm house-trained!  My foster mom says I'm a super smart boy!  Anyone would be SO lucky to have such a smart, loving and beautiful boy like me.\nto adopt Duramax contact; AFLAR. allforloveanimalrescue.org and fill out an adoption application. 805-445-3535",

            "description": "Hi, my name is Danika. I came to this shelter after I was abandoned with my 4 pups. The only information that was given to the shelter staff was a note with my age, my pups birthdays, and the reason for abandonment was because they were moving and could no longer keep us. I am very skiddish and fearful, so I will need a very patient, experienced adopter. The staff can tell that I want to trust people, but it is very difficult for me given my history and the fact that I am in a shelter. I would love to find a loving family that will be patient, give me the time to learn to trust them, as well as understand that I will more than likely always be skiddish and fearful. I do like to play with stuffed toys by myself, and I loved playing with my pups, but they have all been adopted. I get along well with most other dogs, and it would probably be best for me to go into a home with other dogs so they can show me that I can trust people. I could also benefit from being in a home without dogs if it is with someone who is home a lot and will work with me slowly. I have not been around cats, but the staff does plan on interacting me with them to see how I do. If you would like to meet with me, or if you have any questions, please ask staff.\n                                                                         Love,\n                                                                         Danika",

            "description": "Gretzky is the man! Don't be fooled by this guy's senior status, he could pull a carriage if he wanted to! He really does it all, he plays hard, he eats well, and he sleeps like a rock (he's also an excellent cuddler). Gretzky does have a lot of energy though, so he is hoping his adopters love to go on walks (lots of them). His perfect adopters would be active, with another dog-friendly dog. An adopter who can spend a lot of time with him would be great, because he loves his people.\n\nAge: 11\n\nBreed: Pug\n\nWeight: 38 lbs\n\nKid-friendly:\nLoves kids, but does jump, so we would advise no young children. He has lived with kids ages 6+\n\nDogs: He's great with dogs\n\nCats:\nUnknown\n\nCrate trained:\nGretzky does not like being in a crate. He barks, and blankets covering the crate are not advised. He can be left in a crate for up to 6 hours, but would prefer to be out and about.\n\nPotty trained: Yes!\n\nLikes:\nHe LOVES multiple walks a day, being outside, lounging around, eating, and his people!\n\nHealth concerns:\nGretzky has a small fatty lipoma under his right arm. Gretzky also has Lyme Disease, but does not show signs of lameness.\n\nAdoption fee: $375\n\nOur dogs receive heartworm and flea/tick prevention the first week of each month, March through November. Dogs that have stage 3 or 4 dental disease will receive a dental procedure in rescue. We aspirate all lumps and remove those that our veterinary partners suggest removing.\n\nAdopters will be responsible for continued preventatives, follow-up appointments, and medications (if applicable).\n\n$50 discount for seniors (65+) and veterans. Adoption fees help pay for the dog's veterinary exam, vaccinations (rabies, distemper, and bordetella), HW test, blood panel, a microchip, and spay/neuter if needed and additional health needs specific to each animal.\n\nYou can apply to adopt at www.greyfacerescue.org/adoption-application",

Thomas is a super sweet and loving 14 year old 7 lb yorkie who is looking for his new family---this little man may be a senior but he has a whole lot of living still to do----he wakes up happy in the morning and goes to sleep happy at night---in between he just wants to be petted and loved on and FED---he has quite the appetite for a yorkie...oh and he is housetrained too!!! Thomas appears to be hearing impaired but this is a plus because you don't have to worry about him being afraid of fireworks or waking up when YOU go to the bathroom in the middle of the night ?. If interested in adopting our little nugget of a boy please fill out an application at www.floridacockerrescue.org ADOPTION FEE: $215.00",

All AAA dogs are up to date on all vaccinations, spayed or neutered, on heartworm preventative, and microchipped. \n\nDogs are individuals -- The shelter software system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of our dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We encourage you to select your new companion by considering each dog's individual personality and pet qualities instead of relying on a breed label that is only a guess.",

He knows basic commands, is house trained, and does well in the crate. He loves walking with his foster family, but could use some work on the leash-he's a puller!\n\nThis sweet boy lost his owner to cancer and was well-loved and well cared for. He's adjusting well, but looking for a family that can provide the love and stability he's used to! Jubei was raised with another dog in the home and was in a foster home with another dog, but Jubei does like to guard his food and toys and would need an experienced dog owner who can manage and watch this behavior.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Jubei please submit an inquiry directly with Greater Charlotte SPCA by visiting charlottespca.org/adopt.\n\n***Because our rescue is composed entirely of volunteers and we require a home check for each of our adoptable pets prior to them going to their new homes, local applications will take precedence. We will accept out of town applications, but any family further than 60 miles from Charlotte is responsible for finding a representative of a rescue local to them that is willing to perform the home check. All out of town applicants will also have to be willing to drive to Charlotte to meet/pick up the pet as soon as the application is approved.***",

            "description": "IF THIS LISTING IS STILL VISIBLE, THIS PET IS STILL AVAILABLE FOR ADOPTION. PLEASE DO NOT EMAIL US JUST TO ASK IF IT IS STILL AVAILABLE!\n\n\nSay hello to Squiggy! He is about 4 months old, and as sweet as they come! He is UTD on vaccines, parvo negative, de-wormed, and on heartworm and flea prevention. He is currently about 25 lbs.  He will likely be 45-55 pounds at full maturity.\n\nSquiggy was picked up as stray by a good Samaritan, who then contacted us for help. He is playful, loving, and full of energy- your typical puppy!\n\nHe will NOT be neutered prior to adoption. Believe it or not, we get this question about our young pups quite often. Pups this age are far too young to be altered. That will be the responsibility of the adopter once the pup is of age (approx. 6 months).\n\nWe will not be doing meet and greets prior to adoption dates, due to COVID-19 regulations.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out our adoption application FIRST! We expect a surplus of applications, so please allow 2-3 business days for a response once your application has been submitted.\n\nIf approved, once we receive confirmation that you wish to adopt, you will be asked to pay your adoption fee up front. This will place the puppy on hold for you until the scheduled time for pickup. We will send an invoice the same day as your approval. This is our policy due to the overwhelming number of no-shows and last-minute cancellations that have happened in the past. If you decide not to adopt upon meeting the puppy, your fee will be refunded in full before you leave our office.\nHowever, if you do not show up without prior notice, you will forfeit any fees that you have paid.\n\nYou can access our application on our PetFinder homepage, or on our Facebook page as the top pinned post. You can also copy and paste the link below!\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeqyYWJx1_Q63jZ22u-IhaXZ9x0aT5THc5WPpP1BGe0-zSfxg/viewform?usp=sf_link\n\nThank you for reading about this sweet pup, and we look forward to meeting his new family!",

            "description": "Hi friends and future family. I'm Ragna, the viking pittie of lore. You may recognize me from when I was first adopted as a puppy named Jasmine. In the 2.5 years since my adoption (I'll be 3 in May 2021), I've learned a lot. I've developed a love for food and am extremely motivated by it. I've developed a love of toys, especially rope toys. I've learned a lot of basic commands and like to show them off for food. I enjoy sun bathing and hanging out with my people. I love traveling. My mom says I've never met a stranger. While I've been learning about all these things I love, I've also learned I'm not comfortable around young kids. Now that there are infants and toddlers around, I'm deciding I'd prefer an adult only home. Or maybe one with teenagers, since we have things in common like a love for food. My family has reached out to my rescue to help me find that new home. One where I can just be the me I was always meant to be. Can I be me with you?\n\nRagna in a nutshell:\n\nLikes: toys (especially rope toys), food, hanging out with big humans, sunbathing, traveling and car rides. \n\nBehavior: has not had much interaction with other dogs (though she lives with a senior small... we're not yet ready to declare she's dog social), cannot be homed with cats, uncomfortable with toddler and infant energy. \n\nSkills: knows basic commands (sit, stay, come, and wait), crate trained, house trained, walks well on leash and does well with getting groomed\n\nMedical: allergic to chicken, sensitive skin\n\nRagna is currently in Temecula, CA but is looking for a foster or forever home in LA, Orange County, or surrounding areas.  To meet Ragna please visit our website and complete an application- https://k9kismet.org/forms/\n",

She doesn't trust people easily but once you're in her circle she explodes with confidence.  Her adoption program will allow interested parties to meet her during several visits with Nala and our Canine Program Manager.  \nNala needs to be the only pet in an adult home with few visitors.  She is wary of new people, doesn't enjoy meeting strangers and will need a family who understands her need to retreat to a safe spot, especially when it's time to do yard work.  She would do well with a fenced yard so she can play daily and perhaps take a dip in a pool when the weather is nice!\nPlease call/email for an appointment to meet this gorgeous girl!",

I am loving and will happily cuddle on the couch with you. I will welcome new visitors into the home.\nI am not friendly towards other dogs or cats and will need to be the only pet in my home. I like toys and will play fetch with you!\nI currently only pull slightly on the leash and I love car rides!

Visit www.echodogs.org/available-dogs to see more of our dogs. Transportation for the adopted dog IS available. Remember, we are an all-volunteer foster rescue organization - we DO NOT have a physical shelter to visit. Our minimum adoption donation is $300. All dogs are spayed/neutered, up-to-date on vaccinations and micro-chipped. Puppies under 6 months old may not be spayed/neutered. This would be the responsibility of the adopter at their own expense.

            "description": ",Due to COVID-19, all adoptions will be by appointment only. To adopt, complete our online adoption application and an Adoption Counselor will contact you within 48-hours to schedule your adoption appointment. Adoptions for any pets in foster will be completed offsite at our PetSmart Claiborne location on a case by case basis. The safety of our foster parents and community is of utmost importance to us and it will be at the foster's discretion if they'd like to meet at this time. Thank you for choosing adoption! \n\nTwister is a great name for this active, energetic bouncy guy.  He would benefit from basic manners training and that would help him walk better on leash.  He is always up for playing and loves a chance to meet new people.  He is a bit mouthy but the training will help with that.  Mostly this guy just needs a high energy human to share his joy of life.\n\nTo inquire about an adoptable animal from the Louisiana SPCA, please call 504.368.5191, ext. 150 to speak with an adoption counselor.\nTo see more adoptable animals from the Louisiana SPCA, please go to http://la-spca.org/adopt.\n\n\n\nThe petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n",

            "description": "This very handsome young boy is King and he is a doll - just a very happy boy! He loves to play with other dogs and really likes people too. King had the misfortune of ending up at a crowded Animal Control and he was so frightened there so they reached out to us for rescue help. King is now doing so well in foster. He loves playing with all the dogs there and gets along so great with everyone, big and little. He does fine with cats although he will probably try and get them to play with him, and even seems to like the horses, too. He is just a big fluffy playful guy who would do best with another dog to pal around with. King is very puppy like, bouncy and playful. He does walk well on leash and seems eager to learn new things. King is just a nice guy looking for a great home of his own. He is currently 80 pounds and may have more growing to do. When he came into rescue he had a slight limp but xrays showed nothing at all wrong and he runs around just fine now. He will be a great companion for some lucky family. We are not sure if he has lived indoors before or was another discarded farm dog but he should fit right in well with any situation - he's a sweetie!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nNGPR dogs are in foster homes throughout the U.S., NOT Beacon, NY. View full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.\n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

Priscilla is house trained, has good manners and knows how to sit and lay down! Priscilla loves to play and cuddle and eat treats and take walks. She has lived with other dogs but has also gotten in a few fights. We think a home without other pets will set her up for the best chance of success! \n\nPriscilla is one of our favorites! You really have to meet this cutie in person to see how charming she is! \n\nAugusta Dog Adoptions is an all- volunteer, foster- based rescue. We take applications online and are scheduling individual adoptions in the Waynesboro, VA area during the pandemic.  A $175.00 adoption fee ($300 for puppies under 6 months old) helps us take care of all the dogs we rescue. All dogs are spayed/neutered, tested for heartworm and tick borne diseases (if old enough), microchipped, and vaccinated for rabies (if old enough), distemper/parvo and bordetella. They are also treated for internal and external parasites. Many dogs also receive extensive medical care such as dental work and major surgeries. For more information and to apply to adopt, please visit www.augustadogadoptions.org",

Even with his large size he is well mannered. If you\u2019re a person that likes large breeds, he may be the one for you. When turned loose in a fenced in area he likes to be at your side and helping you.  He does seem to be able to climb fences so a leash-walk only home will keep him safest!  When meeting other dogs through a fence he shows no aggression and is interested in playing with them. He has no history of living with cats. No livestock! \n\nAugusta Dog Adoptions is an all- volunteer, foster- based rescue. We take applications online and are scheduling individual adoptions in the Waynesboro, VA area during the pandemic.  A $175.00 adoption fee ($300 for puppies under 6 months old) helps us take care of all the dogs we rescue. All dogs are spayed/neutered, tested for heartworm and tick borne diseases (if old enough), microchipped, and vaccinated for rabies (if old enough), distemper/parvo and bordetella. They are also treated for internal and external parasites. Many dogs also receive extensive medical care such as dental work and major surgeries.

Email: citydogs@city.cleveland.oh.us | Call: (216) 664-3476\nVisit: 9203 Detroit Avenue Cleveland, OH 44102\n\nHours:\n10 AM - 3 PM Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday\n10 AM - 6 pm Tuesday & Thursday\n\nFee: $61 | Includes spay/neuter, shots, microchip, license, 30 days free pet insurance (when registered upon adoption)\n\nThe CITY DOGS mission is to increase adoptions from the City Kennel by changing the image of the pit bulls who make up the majority of the kennel population, by preparing all adoptable dogs in the kennel for lives in loving homes and by creating as many opportunities as possible for the public to meet and get to know our dogs for the terrific pets they are meant to be.\n\nOur Adoption Process...\nHere's a little about how things work:\nAll of the CITY DOGS posted for adoption are available for direct adoption from the kennel, unless noted otherwise. You must schedule a meet with a dog in advance - we are not currently accepting walk-ins. Please look online first to see if there are any dogs you think would be a good fit for your home before scheduling a meet. To get the process started, visit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog and fill out the form. One of our adoption counselors will get in touch to schedule and confirm your meet! At the kennel, an adoption counselor will introduce you and your family to the adoptable dogs, share information we know about them, and discuss our suggested ways for successfully integrating a new dog into your home. You are welcome to meet multiple dogs. If the dog you adopt is already fixed, he or she may leave with you that day - otherwise, the dog can go home after receiving the spay or neuter surgery.)\n\nAbout Our Dogs: All available dogs have gone through a behavioral and medical assessment. This assessment is a snapshot of who the dog is at that given time. We cannot make any guarantees with regard to behavior, temperament or health of any City Dog once they are in the home. Most of our dogs are picked up as strays, so we do not know what kind of home environment they were living in (i.e. with kids, other dogs or other cats), nor do we know if most of them are house trained. Everything we know about them is based on volunteer and staff observations. We do have some dogs in foster homes, where they will have more information about how the dog is in a home environment. It is very hard to tell with certainty whether or not a dog will be good with kids, cats or another dog. If you have kids in the home or another dog, we do require that they be present for a meet and greet with the dog you are considering for adoption.\n\nHeath/Vaccinations: Dogs that are adopted directly from the kennel need to go to your personal vet within two weeks of leaving the kennel. All dogs receive their DAPPL, Rabies, and Bordatella vaccines, though you may be required to get follow up boosters. All dogs come microchipped and with a Cuyahoga County license.?  \n\n\n\n \n",

All dogs receive their DAPPL, Rabies, and Bordatella vaccines, though you may be required to get follow up boosters. All dogs come microchipped and with a Cuyahoga County license.?  \n\n\n\n \n",

No babies or young kids.\n\nShe does ok in the car, but doesn't love it. \n\nAbby is looking for a home where can be spoiled with attention. She can be jealous of other dogs in the home, so being the only dog in the home would be best, but Abby can totally have dog friends and play dates or doggy day care! Abby also loves to snuggle with you and wants to sleep on your bed at night with you! \n\nAbby want to be adopted by people who are home a lot to give her lots of attention.   She loves chasing after squirrels in the backyard and exploring. Abby is super curious! She can sometimes get barky at action she sees through the front windows (cats, squirrels, etc) so no apartments or condos. \n\n\nShe\u2019s doing so well learning how to walk on a leash and will be a great little walking partner.\n\n\nAbby will need a quite forever home with a fenced backyard and will peoples that will continue her positive reinforcement training and socialization with people.\n\n\nAdoption fee is $550 - that covers all of the vaccines (DHLPP, Rabies and Bordetella), current on flea/tick treatment, fecal testing, deworming, sterilization (spay/neuter), Heartworm-Lyme-Ehrlichia-Anaplasma Blood Test, dental cleaning (if needed), Distemper and Parvo blood test to make sure the dog is disease-free, Health Certificate, Microchip with registration, grooming before transport and the flight transport from Guadalajara, Mexico to Portland, Oregon. We will also send the dog home with a brand new collar, ID tag, leash and a small bag of the kibble. \n\n\nFill out an online adoption application here: www.BAPBR.org\n\n\n*Please know that we are a 100% volunteer ran organization, with no paid employees and we work full time jobs and have our own families to care for as well. Due to the large number of applications we receive - we are not able to reply to everyone individually. If we think you are the right match for our dog, we will reach out to you and set up a meet and greet. Thank you in advance for understanding.",

He's a people-oriented pup but is a bit nervous around other dogs. For that reason, we recommend a meet-and-greet for any resident pups to make sure they're a good fit as roommates. In play group, Emmett was tolerant of other dogs greeting him (albeit nervous) and gave some appropriate greetings of his own. He loosened up a bit over time, but stayed close to his handlers throughout. Emmett could use some socialization and a savvy owner who can help with his confidence around other dogs. Staffers say Emmett is a sweet boy who is easy to leash up and walks very nicely. We don't know a lot about his past, but we're sure Emmett has a bright future ahead of him. Whoever takes this boy home will be very lucky, so make an appointment to meet her today.",

He has a sweet disposition, walks well on a leash, is fully housebroken, and gets along with other dogs and seems indifferent to cats although care should be taken during any introduction. We do not know what his breed mix might be, he looks like a textbook Presa Canario but half the size.\n\nCooper is currently down south with one of our rescue partners and has been brought up to date on his shots and neutered. Cooper is undergoing heartworm treatment. Once he has been certified heartworm negative, he will be able to come north to his new home, Due to the treatment he's undergoing it most likely will be in March.\n\nCooper must go to a home that is experienced with mastiff breeds and is set up to accommodate this type of dog. Please read up on the breed before applying. Due to his size, Cooper should not go to a home with very young children.\n\nIf you are able to open your house and heart to this big softie and can wait until he's able to come north in March, please submit an application and we will get in touch with you.",

Sasha is about 2 years old and has had no basic training.  She does not have the best manners but we are slowly working on it.  Sasha has not met kids yet so we are unsure of how she would do.  Young kids under ten would not be a good idea due to her jumping up.  This beauty has potential and she desires all the cuddles and pets someone can give!   Please research POSITIVE training techniques before applying to adopt. We care very much about your application answers and they are reviewed for completeness and the best match. Please fill out an application on the included link: https://threerivershs.org/adoption-app-2/\n\nThe adoption fee of $250 includes spay/neuter, current vaccines, microchip, free vet visit, 30 days of pet health insurance, puppy book, and engraved ID tag.",

This poor girl was brought into a local animal control facility with her 3 other friends. Their owner passed and was a hoarder. When people went to clean up the house they realized there was 4 dogs in the home. She absolutely loves human attention. She gets growly when any other dogs come for attention, but we think shell get over it with time. She kennels with the female she came in with and they do fine. We just arent sure how shell be with small children so at this time we will not allow a home with them. \n\nKeep up with us, our events, our adoptable animals, etc on our Facebook page under Mollys Mutts Animal Rescue!

He was skinny and starving and they have nursed him back to health. He is way too big for them to keep and so they have asked for help in finding a furever home.\n\nTucker is currently living with 2 cats and a small dog comes to stay every few weeks, and he has no issues. He loves to go on walks and never barks on walks. But he does pull to get closer to the pups. When dogs bark or lunge at him. he pulls away. He is crate trained. \n\nHe\u2019s an odd guy, very friendly and loving, but needs breaks and kinda shuts down sometimes. He has some reactivity to the doorbell/knocking but is otherwise VERY friendly with people. Has gotten better impulse control with training (jumping less, fetch, waiting at doors..)\n\nTucker has not been around kids. Only on walks and he loves to watch them. He suckles his dog bed at night and loves chasing squeaker toys. \n\nNow for the bad: He is an anxious dog. He gets easily worried. He does need to be sedated to get his nails trimmed and has had a few ear infections.\nHe has allergies that he was getting shots (apoquel) for but the vet now thinks it\u2019s from food so they\u2019re experimenting with his diet.\n\nApplication and meet and greet required.\n\nApplication available under the adoptables tab at www.pawsa.org",

            "description": "I have an Adoption Pending and will be going home soon! I hope you will consider one of our other wonderful dogs in need. Thank you!\n\nPretty Sasha spent three weeks, at the City of Mobile Shelter in AL, where she was taken in as a stray.  Being a black dog, she was passed by time and time again by prospective adopters. No one took her home, as happens all too often to black dogs, no matter how sweet and loving they may be.  When we learned what a good girl Sasha is, we took her into Sunshine to find her a forever home.\n\nSasha is estimated to be six years old, weighs 65 lbs, and is most likely a purebred Black Lab. Our lead Southern volunteer, Lisa, was so impressed with Sasha when she met her, remarking that Sasha is prettier than her pictures show and that Sasha has the sweetest personality.  Sasha loved the soft stuffed toys that Lisa brought her as well as treats and being petted.  She is a little shy when first meeting new people but warms up quickly.  Sasha liked the other dogs she met at the vet clinic, nosing up politely for a sniff and a hello.  She has not had an opportunity to meet cats. Sasha's coat is very shiny and she has a nice moderate energy level.  We think she will be so happy to be someone\u2019s walking partner and special girl!\n\nSasha is spayed, vaccinated, and micro-chipped.  She is completing heartworm treatment and will be ready to travel to a new forever home in mid-February. \n\nRescued dogs come with a range of needs - from behavioral to emotional to medical.  When approved applicants adopt such dogs, they agree to continue the rehabilitation we have begun.  \n\nIf you would like to be part of Sasha's rescue story, and you have already been approved for adoption through SGRR, please contact the Adoption Committee at: CandyVS2@aol.com      to be considered to adopt sweet Sasha.                  \n\nIf not yet approved for adoption, please visit our website to learn more and to submit an online application:     http://sunshinegoldenrescue.com/adoption-info1.html  \n\nPlease DO NOT use the ASK ABOUT button to contact us, about this dog, as that will delay our ability to respond to your inquiry.  Please direct any questions regarding your application status to:  ajpillinger@gmail.com     \n\nThank you!\n \nABOUT OUR RESCUE \nBefore being approved to adopt, all potential adopters will be required to complete our online application and participate in our pre-adoption review process. The process includes the completion of an online application, a reference from the applicants' vet, a phone interview, and a visit to the applicants' home.  The application process helps us determine what type of Golden would be best suited for the applicants' life style.  In some cases, the specific dog you are interested in may have found a home before this process is complete or further assessment may indicate that this dog is not the right match for your family.  We are frequently getting new Goldens in need of a home, so we encourage you to apply and complete the application process so that when the right dog comes along you will be ready. \n\nThe information provided on each dog is based on the observations of our vets, volunteers, fosters, and when available, trainers. While we do our best to report any and all issues, SGRR does not make any guarantees as to the health or temperament of any dog. Dogs evolve differently in different environments and we cannot predict with any certainty how the dog you adopt will behave and adapt in your home.\n\nSGRR ADOPTION FEES - Effective May 1, 2020  (subject to change)\n  \n  $750    Puppy - up to 6 months              \n  $650    Young 6 months - 6 years            \n  $550    Senior 7 - 9  years                       \n  $450    Senior 10 years and older          \n \n  $550    Young Special Needs                \n  $400    Senior 7+ Special Needs                \n\n$1000    Young Bonded Pair                   \n  $900    Senior 7+ Bonded Pair         \n\nA contract is signed on the day of adoption.  Under the terms of the contract, all adopters are required to bring their SGRR dog to a vet within 7 business days.  All dogs receive basic veterinary care prior to adoption.  However, if an adopter's vet identifies an illness that an adopter is not willing to treat, then the dog may be returned and a full refund would be provided. \n\nMost of our dogs are fostered in private homes.  We do not have a facility to visit.  We are committed to our dogs before, during, and after adoption! To this end, the rescue retains an interest in each dog and our dogs can never be surrendered, re-homed, or sold. Should an adopter no longer be able to keep their SGRR dog, SGRR must be notified so that we can take the dog back into rescue and place it into another home. We reserve the right to remove a dog at any time should we find the adopter is no longer providing proper care.  Adopters agree to follow up visits as needed.  \n\nPlease be a ray of light for this Sunshine dog and make a tax deductible donation toward medical care and other expenses.   Every cent of your generosity goes directly toward the care of a Sunshine dog.\n\nPlease visit our website at: http://sunshinegoldenrescue.com  to learn more about our rescue and to make a Donation to support Sunshine Golden Retriever Rescue.  \n\nTHANK YOU!",

House trained, this gentle giant lets you know when she needs to go outside. She likes to sit close and cuddle, play fetch, and sleep at your feet. She's still mouthy when she plays, but can be easily distracted with toys. Would recommend she goes to a home with a backyard so she can play and dig hiding spots for her bones. She likes to relax in the cool evening air but comes back for snuggles. Would recommend she goes to a home that has experience with this amazing breed. Sometimes she gets nervous from city noises and can try to escape her leash while on a walk. She jumps and bites playfully, but shouldn't go to a home with older people or children until she's trained out of this behavior.\n\nThis pet's adoption fee is $425.

No small kids please. Trix was used as a temperament testing dog in the shelter so she is great with all dogs. She likes to give hugs and is a little shy. She warms up faster to women. She will do well with an active family who will take her for walks and hikes. She is a great dog that seeks attention and like to snuggle. If you are looking for a loving companion who will be right by your side, Trix is the girl for you. Please email 4everyoursrescue@gmail.com for an adoption application.\nAdoptions only in Reno, Sacramento, PennValley, GrassValley, Nevada City, Folsom, Roseville, Lincoln, Auburn and surrounding areas.",

There will be a drop down menu where you must read and meet all of the prerequisites. Next, read the \"Steps To Adoption\", fill out the \"Interest Form\" and submit it online. THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO APPLY. Unfortunately, we are unable to respond to inquires made in any other way.\n\nPoodle Rescue will contact you if we feel this dog, or a similar dog in our program, matches the specifications on your Questionnaire/Interest Form. Please keep in mind Poodles and Poodle Mixes are in high demand therefore the demand for them far outweigh the supply. If you do not hear from us please re-submit your Interest form quarterly as they are not recurring. Unfortunately, we cannot answer email or telephone inquiries about our available dogs.  Please be sure you have a current phone number listed on the questionnaire/Interest Form and the best time we can reach you. Adoption Fees vary.\n\nAll dogs are spayed/neutered, current on shots, parasite / heart worm disease tested (and treated if positive).

She knows the sit, come and down commands. She is a very smart and well-behaved pup. She loves treats and playing fetch. She is good at meeting other dogs, though she seems intimidated by higher energy dogs. She weighs 40 pounds and is full grown. This pup is microchipped. We believe you can always teach an \u2018old\u2019 dog new tricks, so we highly recommend continued obedience training for this smart pup; it stimulates the dog's mind and establishes a good dog/adopter relationship. This pup, like all pups, should be on heartworm preventative; an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. If you are interested in adopting this dog, and are already approved to adopt through our organization, please contact dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with the pup\u2019s name and ID number in the subject line. OTHERWISE, please submit an adoption application online: http://www.lastchanceanimalrescue.org/adoptus.html E-mail dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with questions.

She loves meeting new people and is super friendly! She is very food motivated and knows sit, stay, and come already! She can be insecure at times, so she would really need a confident owner to help build her up in the world. She can be a little too much for children, so she would need an adult-only home. \n\nIf interested in adopting Chevelle, please submit an online adoption application!

Submit an application from our website and then make an appointment to meet her.\n\nBetsy Bucket is not eligible for foster and will be a straight adoption.\n\nAge: ~6 years \nWeight: ~57lbs\nHousebroken: Working on it! She needs to be on a strict schedule and due to her steroid meds she needs to go out a little more frequently. She currently goes outside 4-5 times per day. \nCrate trained: Working on it! Takes some time to settle but overall doing well with her crate training\nDog sociability: Friendly with dogs on walks\nCat sociability: Unknown\nKids: Friendly with kids!\nIdeal home: Betsy Bucket has an autoimmune skin condition that requires lifelong medication. She is looking for an adopter that can provide her meds and keep her comfortable!\n\nBetsy is a sweet and calm mature dog. She's a great companion on long neighborhood walks and loves a belly scratch and her comfy napping spot inside her crate. She will play fetch if it's nice and warm out and loves lounging in the sun. She has done amazing with the young child in her foster home and would likely make a great family pet. We have seen incredible improvement with her autoimmune skin condition over these last few months and are hopeful that it will only continue to improve! Betsy is such a sweet dog deserving of a wonderful forever home.\n\nBetys Bucket's adoption fee is 300. She is spayed, up to date on core vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative. Betsy has been diagnosed with Pemphigus foliaceus, an autoimmune disorder affecting the skin. Small fluid-filled blisters form, which can rupture easily and cause lesions/infection. Pemphigus folieaceous can be treated/managed with lifelong steroids and dermatologist-recommended medications/treatments. Betsy has shown extreme improvement since beginning steroid therapy. Adopters should be prepared to continue treatment with private veterinarian and potentially with a dermatologist. \n\n***We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications. We ask that you please be patient and someone will be in touch via email within 72 hours. Please do not email us unless you have not received a response in 72 hours. Please only fill out one adoption application. ***",

            "description": "Gus is a 6 Year old American Staffordshire terrier that adores his people.  Probably weighs around 60 or so pounds. He is a big goof ball that loves snuggling on the couch and going out on a leisurely walk around the neighborhood.  He hasn\u2019t been around other dogs much so he\u2019s very cautious and growls if they get too close. So we think that he will do best in a home with no other animals.   He\u2019s coming into rescue because his family can not manage their children and a dog, at this time. The toddler is unfortunately bugging him and he doesn\u2019t appreciate it. Therefore,  we would love to find him a family with older kids that can listen and be respectful, when around him.  He is fully house trained, doesn\u2019t chew inappropriate things and he\u2019s kennel trained.  His current family has given him the run of the house when they are away from home, and he\u2019s done just fine.  But, we recommend crating him for the first few weeks, as he adjusts to new surroundings.  Changing homes can be a little stressful & unsettling.  If you\u2019re ready for a big hunk of love in your life, please reach out to us about our Handsome boy. He will be your best friend for the rest of his life.\n\nWe will be setting up meetings with a $50 deposit that goes towards your adoption fee if you adopt. We are also doing video of interior and exterior of home in lieu of the homecheck. \n\nWe are a FORCE FREE rescue. The adoption contract you will be signing specifically states that you agree to NEVER use any aversive methods nor tools like a shock, prong or choke collar. We are never sure about breed because we do not do DNA (we make our best guess), so if that is important to you, this dog may not be the right choice for you. Please, consider everything when making a decision to adopt a dog.  As part of your adoption package, each dog will be fully vaccinated (Da2PP, Rabies), have a microchip, and be spayed/neutered. You may need to come back to us to complete shots, spay or neuter, hw test. You will receive 6 mths of HW preventative.You will receive a free bag of premium food, as well as a gift card from Choice Pet Market if you live in one of the designated zip codes . Training is MANDATORY and will be scheduled at a later date and place.",

            "description": "Diamond truly does sparkle! This gem is a 4 year old 50 lb boxer mix with eyes that shine brighter than any stone. She was found as a stray in the South and is looking to make a fresh start. She absolutely loves people, snuggling, and attention. She gets along well with other dos and walks great on a leash. She will need a home that understands the mental and physical stimulation Boxers require and that have the time and patience to dedicate to finishing up her basic obedience training and settle her into yet another new environment. While she has a GREAT start under her belt she still needs some finishing touches, but don't let her \"ruff\" start take away from the gem she truly is! Her adoption fee is $295 and that includes she is spayed, microchipped, and up to date on all vaccines, flea/tick treatments, and heartworm preventative. If you are interested in adopting any of our animals please fill out an application on our website www.lastchanceranch.org\n Primary Color: Tan Age: 4yrs 1mths 0wks",

            "description": "01/13/21 MEET \"LITTLE MISS MATTIE WIGGLE BUTT\" a.k.a. MATTIE\nMattie was brought into BR- NWA's care on October 24, 2019 from NE Arkansas. Weighing in at only 35 pounds of skin and bones, she was a very sickly little boxer girl suffering with severe intestinal problems, chronic diarrhea, ongoing digestion issues, and as if that wasn't enough, she was also heartworm positive. \nIf you wonder why you haven't seen much about Mattie on Facebook, it's because at first she was just too frail for adoption, and BR volunteers were down to a bare minimum with hardly a minute to spare for the few volunteers to make Facebook posts or fundraise for her care. So, Mattie basically \"lived\" at the veterinary clinic until November 13, 2019 when the rescue\u2019s long-seasoned and highly dedicated volunteer, Denise, couldn\u2019t help but bring Mattie home to nurture her during the extensive heartworm treatment. Little did anyone know what a challenge this would be as Mattie had a severe allergic reaction to the heartworm treatment medication which forced a different treatment plan that has not been fully successful. (More on this topic in subsequent posts.) Bear in mind that these are the early, intake photos of Mattie when she first came into Boxer Rescue NWA\u2019s care. \nMattie's veterinary expenses, special foods, medications, and ongoing vet care has not come with a small price tag, but she has been well worth the $3,437.71 of care which \u201cwiped out\" boxer rescues' meager savings. We estimate that with her final vet visits, medications and expenses, her total vetting and care will exceed $4,000. \nAs most of you know, this rescue group is a no kill, 501(c)-3 nonprofit. We are an all-volunteer team and receive no funding from any animal rescue organizations such as the ASPCA, Animal Rescue League, Humane Society, etc. - these organizations do not typically help local rescues, nor do we have wealthy contributors or corporations keeping us afloat. We function solely on the donations of boxer lovers like you and us. \nIf you can find it in your heart (or wallet) to help with Mattie's extensive health care needs and expenses, this striving rescue can replenish its much-needed resources and open the door to other boxers desperately in need. A tax-deductible donation of any amount, even just $5 or $10, adds up to make the difference in the life of one more boxer in need. \nSTAY TUNED FOR MORE ON MATTIE, ADOPTABILITY, AND UPDATED PHOTOS OF HER TODAY!  jc/dm\n\n01/13/21  MORE ON LITTLE MISS MATTIE WIGGLE BUTT a.k.a. \u201cMATTIE\u201d\nSo, here we are, 14 months later, and Mattie is closer to being free of the microfilaria - we'll know after her next checkup in early February if it's successful. If successful, this little sweetie pie will be available for adoption! \nThough Mattie no longer has adult heartworms, it is the heartworm larvae (microfilaria) that has been incredibly resistant to die.\nThanks to our dedicated volunteer, Denise's TLC and persistent care, her MANY trips to the vet for Mattie treatment and follow up, her attention to bringing Mattie to full health, this \"pup\" has \"fattened up\" nicely, and as you can tell by the pictures, she looks amazing!! \nSome of our rescued boxers have had to be in long-term care due to the severe state of their health upon intake. However, we hope that soon, Mattie will be available for adoption into a well-deserved forever home if the microfilaria continues to diminish. \nABOUT MATTIE'S TEMPERAMENT: \nA little cautious around some men (timid), Mattie has no issues with women or children. She gets along with other dogs and is a sweet, affectionate, happy, 50 lb. spayed boxer who loves to be with her people. Whether you\u2019re going for a ride, walking at the park or just cuddling on the couch watching tv - she's all in! \nIf you have ever considered adopting a rescued boxer, remember to submit your applications soon (and include the vetting records of your current pets showing they are current on vaccines and heartworm prevention.) If you have already submitted an application, be sure to let us know your application is on file and any vetting records on your current pets. \nMattie is small boxer who has been a funny, loving companion. Her loving foster \"mom\" has nurtured this little \"wiggle butt\" to become the beautiful, healthy, gentle girl that she is.\nWe hope you don't mind us posting this message again, as we are desperately in need of resources (volunteers and donations), and we invite you to join the rescue team as a foster volunteer. Please comment and/or share this post.\n\u201cMattie's veterinary expenses, special foods, medications, ongoing vet care has not come with a small price tag, but she has been well worth the $3,437.71 of care which \u201cwiped out\" boxer rescues' meager savings.

            "description": "This beautiful boy is Bodie.  He is about 10 years old and weighs around 70 lbs.  Bodie has cerebellar disease so he's very wobbly when standing or walking and sometimes even stumbles and falls.  He can walk with support from a harness and will soon be getting his very own wheelchair to assist in his mobility and allow him more freedom to sniff and explore which he loves to do! Bodie needs a human who is strong enough to support him at times with the harness (or help get him in and out of a wheelchair) and who is patient with him during feeding time and walks as he takes longer than your average pup. Bodie also needs a home with a fenced in yard. He loves nothing more than sitting outside in the grass near his people. He will slip and fall on tile floors, so area rugs or carpeting are a must have for him.",

In foster care, with lots of positive reinforcement and a couple of confident playful female dogs, he has really come out of his shell. Eli has the heart of a sweet, eager-to-please Playful and a bit mischievous puppy inside a cautious exterior. His ideal forever family will understand that his shyness is not about them but rather about his lack of proper socialization as a young dog, and will help him continue to grow into a balanced happy dog. \tOther Dogs: VERY playful: lots of wrestling, toy tugging, and chasing. Note: he was not fond of male dogs before he was neutered. He is in foster care with female dogs only. \tEasy to walk, maintains loose leash. Loves walks, but can be startled occasionally and needs to always wear a martingale collar. \tSnuggle/lover rating: Is a-ok hanging out nearby, loves pets once he knows you. \tCrate trained, housebroken, likes play time with other dogs and opportunities to chew on toys often. \tType of Learner: I want to please but would like to go slow \tEnergy Level: Medium energy blend, needs some play prior to relaxation \tI can be shy and timid when meeting new people and prefer to take things slowly \tMotivation: Needs encouragement and sometimes takes treats \tKnown Skills: Watch Me, Leave It, Wanna Go Outside? In your crate, Wait at a door to continue \tAdditional Info: Eli will do best in a home with a playful confident female dog to continue to help him learn about all of the wonderful things that come with living with people --",

Their notes on him say that he's usually tolerant around children, and relaxed / affectionate around other dogs, but he does not like cats. Gilbert is understandably very stressed out here in the shelter. He happily accepts every treat he's offered though, and will take them from your hand very gently. Gilbert needs time to warm up to new people. He makes people work to earn his trust, but once he trusts you he's very sweet.",

At this point , he is crate trained, and eager to please. Hiking, running, agility , would all be things this guy would be a good candidate for.\n If the little man looks like your cup of tea, text Cate @ (310) 344-3869\n\nThanks for looking!\n",

            "description": "Meet Maui! Maui is currently enrolled in the P.A.C.K. Program, a 9 week intensive program for routine obedience, agility, and handling training with a prison inmate trainer and he is almost ready to show off all that he has learned to new adopters. His new skills include 'sit', 'stay', 'down', 'shake', 'wave' and more! New adopters should realize that PACK Program graduates will require regular, ongoing reinforcement of learned behaviors in order for them to become permanent.\nMaui is a sweet, timid boy. He is apprehensive with new people and in new situations. It will take a little patience to get him used to all the new people and things he will encounter in his life. Once he knows his human is good people he can't get enough affection and loves to be close to his person. Until he trusts you fully, calm corrections for any undesirable behaviors are most effective. Anything more will overwhelm him. Maui plays well with all the other dogs in the program, he can be a little nippy at times but this behavior is easily corrected with a verbal redirection. As with any new dog, monitored play time is recommended until you get to know him better. Maui should not go to a home with cats. He is house trained and crate trained as well.\nMaui is set to graduate the first week of February. This timid guy would love to be your new best friend. It must just take a little time to convince him that you're the one. Apply to meet him today and show Maui what the good life is all about.If you are not viewing this adoption listing from our website at www.bdar.org, please go there to get more information, find our adoption application, or submit an inquiry.

I absolutely love socializing with other dogs and being very goofy, but I can be shy with humans, so I could use some work on my confidence and a home who can give me space when new people come over. My foster's are always raving about how wonderful I am and I think if they didn't foster so much they would snatch me up themselves. I am just the sweetest and most loyal goofball/cuddle bud you will ever meet.\n\nAge: 1 year old\nBreed: Staffordshire Bull Terrier Mix\nSpayed: Yes \nAdoption Fee: $200.00.",

            "description": "*PLEASE read Oliver's write up ENTIRELEY as he does have special needs and is seeking a specific home!*\n\nOliver is a spunky Catahoula mix that is about 2 years old and weighs 50 pounds. who is loyal to his people. He enjoys long walks with lots of opportunities to sniff, morning snuggles before everyone gets up for work, and the occasional all-out run (he has some of the funniest zoomies you'll ever see). He is house broken and knows all the basic commands (sit, down, stay, paw, roll over) and is currently learning the place command. He is super smart, eager to please, and food motivated. While he loves being with his people, he's also perfectly content snoozing on the couch during the workday until his pawrents get home.\n\nUnfortunately, Oliver's beautiful blue eyes don't work very well and he's completely blind in his right eye and mostly blind in his left eye (he can likely just see blurry shapes). He's seen a vet and ophthalmologist who have confirmed that it's a neurological issue and, while he's not in any pain, the impairment is permanent and his vision will continue to deteriorate.\nDue to his vision issues, Oliver is very fearful of new people. He must go to a quiet, adult-only home with limited visitors that will help reassure him that he is safe and loved. At least one other confident dog in the house is a must, as well as a fenced in yard (preferably a privacy fence) as he's never really done a lot of around-town walking (although he is good on a leash). He currently lives with two cats whom he's curious about and occasionally chases but they live in harmony together 95% of the time - the other 5% the cats just hide on an elevated surface. His adoption fee is a donation of your choice and includes he is neutered, microchipped, and up to date on all vaccines, flea/tick treatments, and heartworm preventative. If you are interested in adopting any of our animals please fill out an application on our website www.lastchanceranch.org \n Primary Color: Merle Secondary Color: White Age: 1yrs 10mths 2wks",

She had never seen a veterinarian until coming to rescue.  She will be seeing our doctors soon, and will be available for adoption very soon thereafter.  Daisy's owners told the shelter that she appeared to have had some sort of \"seizure\", but neither the shelter, nor AHGRR has seen any to date.  However, this will be thoroughly investigated by our doctors.  Daisy is very sweet, and very \"puppy\".  She does fine with the other dogs as long as she is not totally mugged by them when meeting them for the first time.  She LOVES people.  She does need some training, though she appears to know the command \"sit\".  Daisy has decided to accept applications now so that when she is ready to leave (around the 2nd week of February), her new person will already be chosen.  If you would like to offer Daisy a forever home, please submit an application which you can find on our website (www.almostheaven-golden-retriever-rescue.org)",

He just came to the shelter after being in a home for 7 years (at no fault of his own), but is having a hard time adjusting. He can be nervous throughout handling, but does allow petting once he is more comfortable. He also does not  like his food and chews touched, so he needs a family that is willing to work on this with him using positive reinforcement and one of our recommended training programs.\n\nWhile he does have some things to work on, once he is comfortable he loves being cuddled in bed, getting treats, and going on walks. Give this sweet boy a chance!\n\nAxel's age recommendation is 12 years of age and up. He is currently around 8 years old.",

Sadly, Zeus was brought into the shelter due to his owner's declining health. Zeus is ready to share all his love with you at the golden age of 9 years young. If a darling, low-key guy is the one you've been searching for, please apply to meet Zeus! Zeus has not been around too many other dogs, so dogs are case to case. He would do best with a female dog, if any, no males. Due to his minimal socialization with other dogs, a low-key, submissive female may be best for Zeus. We would suggest a cat-free home, however.",

She's friendly and wants attention/petting, but needs people to go slow so she doesn't get frightened. We highly recommend a positive reinforcement training program to help her build her confidence and strengthen the bond with her family. Once she's comfortable, we see her being a total lap dog that can also be your exercise buddy! She can be selective with other dogs, so dog parks would not be a good idea. She seems to prefer people anyways!\n\nMajorie's age recommendation is 6 years old and up, and kids must know to go slow with her.",

Stuffed animals are my favorite! One of the other dogs here is my buddy and we love to play together. I can give you a million kisses in under a minute. I know how to sit and give paw when asked. I am a sweetheart who loves to always be close to the ladies who take care of me. I am also up to date on vaccines. I'm excited to meet my forever family. If you are Interested in giving me a loving home please email hampshirecountyac@gmail.com to request an application.",
