            "description": "The name Maverick has the meaning of independent and bursting with spirit. Pasadena Humane's Maverick was brought in by an owner who simply didn't have the time or energy to deal with the playful spirit he has! Maverick is reported to play hard and is full of energy. Here at the shelter, Maverick was confused and becsme anxious, although with calm and consistent interaction with our staff, a more trusting dog is begining to emerge. At a youthful 2 years of age, Maverick still has a lot of puppy energy and playfulness. A suggested home for Maverick is one that is already dog savvy, only with older kids and adults, and has the time to give to a couple of walks (or jogging?) per day. Maverick is a guy who wants your attention for playing and is not a couch potato. In looking at Maverick's picture taken when he first arrived at Pasadena Humane, we see a somewhat shy looking dog with some probable anxious panting. But take a look at those soft, hopeful eyes! He is looking for just the right fur-ever home . . . is yours the one? Learn more about our virtual adoption process .",

She gets along good with the other resident dogs, loves to play and\n\nknows the command sit.\n\nOn first meeting, she will be shy and cautious, barking a bit but it only takes a few minutes and she calms down.\n\nLady Bea seems very attentive and intelligent and looks you right in the eye when you are talking to her. She is food motivated so these two combined should make her easily trainable.\n\nWe are working on crate training, she must have had a very bad experience before she came to us while crated or just always crated, hard to say, but with patience and love I think she will trust you.\n\nShe does well being gated in any area of the home while we are working on the crate.\n\nLady Bea is housebroken and she will let you know when she wants out either by looking at you and barking or running back and forth to the door so pay attention to her signals!!\n\nLady Bea has a tendency to pull on the leash when walking, we are working on this and she is learning quickly.\n\nShe is a high energy pup and would be best suited in an active family environment. She would be a great hiking, running or all around outdoor companion.\n\nLady Bea also is a cuddle bug, if she could fit in your lap and sleep that's where she would be.\n\nLady Bea would make a amazingly fun, loving and sensitive companion to one very lucky family!\n\nLady Bea does need a big fenced in yard to run and play, or someone that is dedicated to her exercise and energy needs, a doggy park would be awesome!!\n\nPick Lady Bea!!!\n\nThe adoption fee covers the cost of the animal's spay/neuter surgery, microchipping, FIV/FeLK testing (for cats) or Heartworm Testing (for dogs), deworming and all core age appropriate vaccinations. For the most complete information regarding this animal, and all of our adoptable pets, please ensure you are visiting our website directly at www.RescueCrew.org.

Long story short, all my beautiful pups found loving homes, and now I am ready to find my furever home! I love meeting friends, going on walks, getting belly rubs, and all the treats in the world! Great with other dogs - big or small! I've had sleepovers with one of the volunteers, and she is so happy because I am 'potty-trained' apparently, it is something important. All in all, my ideal home is one where I get spoiled and loved on. I am also great with tiny humans and would love to have a playful dog friend if possible - but it is not required.\n\nTo adopt, fill out an application at\n\nwww.paws4you.org/application\n\nTo get our newsletter, text\nPAWS4YOU\nto\n22828\n\nConnect with us:\n\nwww.instagram.com/paws4you\n\nwww.twitter.com/paws4you\n\nwww.facebook.com/paws4you",

Huey is an 11 month old large mixed breed boy in search of a home with the time, energy and patience for a puppy. Although almost a year old, Huey is very much still a puppy and will require all the same things a puppy needs; socialization, positive reinforcement training, patience, time and plenty of exercise. \n\nHuey is so far a social boy at the shelter and gets excited to be around other dogs and would do great with another social dog in his new home. He loves to play(especially fetch!) and will need a home with the time to take Huey on plenty of walks, adventures or other outings. Huey is a big boy and doesn't realize his size, and although will make a great cuddle buddy after he is worn out from the day, would do best in a home without small children that he can knock over.\n\nIf you think Huey is the boy for you, he is sure to steal your heart with his goofy nature and adorable personality.\n\nTRAINING AND SOCIALIZATION:\nPuppies require time, patience, and commitment to help them grow into happy, healthy adult dogs. To give the full commitment that puppies need, we do not permit adopters to adopt more than 1 puppy, of the same age or from the same litter. While it may seem cute, and even easier, to adopt 2 puppies at the same time, research shows that it's not a good idea. Littermate Syndrome can occur when 2 puppies are raised together. Their deep bond can impede their ability to properly socialize with humans and other dogs during this critical developmental period which can lead to behavioral issues as adult dogs, including reactivity and aggression. Please also consider force free, science-based training to help your new puppy become a happy, well socialized family member that won't end up back at our shelter. To find a trainer on island, visit fearfreepets.com or apdt.com.",

Needless to say, it made us nervous to see what Maisel had become. What we took back was not what we feared. What we have is a sweet, kind, loving dog. She\u2019s energetic, and her greetings to new dogs can be a little rough. She doesn\u2019t understand that her exuberant enthusiasm isn\u2019t always the best approach. Sometimes it might even sound like she could be mean. Really she just wants to meet someone sooooo bad. She would do better with a more relaxed dog in the home. Playful is fine, but someone who won\u2019t try to boss her around. And absolutely no cats. She does enjoy a game of chase, so smaller animals wouldn\u2019t do well with her. She needs an experienced owner, someone who knows how to train a dog. But she will repay you in love and gratitude tenfold over what you give her. She\u2019s really just a happy sweet dog. \n\nMaisel is a 1.5 year old pit mix. She is spayed, up to date on vaccines, and microchipped.\n\nHer adoption fee is $175.",

These girls have been thru thick and thin together but we have decided they will do best in separate homes, they love each other but rely too heavily on each other.  They are both very loving and super affectionate.  They walk like angels on a leash and are up for all of the adventures life has to offer.  We would love to adopt them separately but in close proximity so allow for play dates with each other.   \n\nDottie is currently finishing up heartworm treatment (covered by the rescue) and is spayed and up to date on her vaccines.\n\nApply to adopt this cuddle bug today! She is so looking forward to calling your home her furever after.\n\nwww.LuckyDogRefuge.com\n\nREAD THE FOLLOWING FOR INSTRUCTIONS ON SUBMITTING AN APPLICATION FOR THIS PET:\n\n- The first step towards adoption is to complete an adoption application, which can be found online at our website www.LuckyDogRefuge.com, under the \u201cApply Now\u201d tab\n\nor\n\nat https://forms.gle/LXKMKSnagxLSad668.\n\n- Do NOT use the Petfinder links or email to ask us about our adoptable dog listings - we do not always receive these messages and will not respond to them.\n\n- Please do not ask if a dog is still available - we do our best to update their status as quickly as possible. If a dog is listed for adoption, it means we have not yet approved an adopter and are still accepting applications.\n\n- PLEASE NOTE THAT ONLY APPROVED ADOPTERS WILL BE PERMITTED TO MEET OUR RESCUES.\n\nThanks for considering a rescue pup!\n\n",

            "description": "Say hello to Arlo! He's a handsome guy looking for his forever home. He will be a year old later this month (Jan 2021). He weighs in at  60 pounds, which he feels is the perfect lap dog weight. \n\nArlo loves toys! But they definitely need to be durable--he will make short work of destroying the wimpy ones. He is good with other dogs his size and currently goes to daycare a couple days a week. He has had no exposure to small dogs and very limited exposure to cats. \n\nArlo's other favorite pastime is cuddling with his people. As you can see in his pictures he is a bit of a couch potato and a ham for the camera.\n\nHe has to watch his sodium intake but doesn't require a special food, just care in selecting his treats.\n\nDue to his enthusiastic nature, Arlo will be best in a home with no small children. Arlo is up for a road trip and rides well in the car. \n\nArlo sleeps in his crate at night but isn't sold on the idea during the day. It's a work in progress. He is also making progress on his leash walking.\n\nFor more information about Arlo contact The Pet Connection at 913-671-7387. He's in the Kansas City metro, but transport is available to the right home. \n\nINTERESTED IN ADOPTING THIS PET? Fill out an Adoption Application now! Appointments can also be made to meet a pet by calling us at 913-671-PETS (913-671-7387).  \n\nADOPTION INFORMATION:\nPrior to adoption, our animals are: \n**Tested for diseases \n**Vaccinated \n**Spayed/neutered \n**Microchipped \n\nNO COST adoptions with an encouraged donation are accepted. \n\nThe Pet Connection also offers adopters a FREE veterinary examination and a medical care support plan for 60 days after adoption, as well as lifetime behavioral training, safe sanctuary for pets returned in emergency situations, extensive assistance with lost and found pets, and other expert pet services in a variety of areas, including pet selection, behavioral issues, general training, nutrition, and transition to adoptive homes.\n\nPlease visit our website at www.thepetconnection.org for more information about The Pet Connection and for a full listing of our available pets, \n\nCall or text The Pet Connection at 913-671-7387 if you can foster, adopt, or sponsor a special needs dog or cat! \n\nThe Pet Connection is a membership organization operating a no-kill adoption center in Shawnee, Kansas. \n\n",

We were told he was good with cats, however that has not been tested here. He has been reactive towards other dogs here but was told he was accepting of mellow dogs. He has great energy but also LOVES to snuggle. He is kennel trained, potty trained and has great basic obedience. Prefer adopter have dog experience with reactive dogs, so that he can continue his training. \n\nALL adoptions are done FACE TO FACE, we DO NOT ship dogs out, adopters are responsible to travel if they live outside the Fairbanks area and stay at least one 24 hour visit with the dog.  \n\nPlease DO NOT email the rescue asking if this or any dog is available, all our dogs are available for adoption unless their ad states pending next to their name. Inquiries just asking if a dog/puppy is available will be deleted! If you cannot spend 2 mins reading an ad you have NO business getting a puppy/dog! \n\nAll adoption fees are $400\n\nPlease review our adoption process before filling out an application. MUST be at least 21 to adopt, do not contact asking to bend the rules.

We took the puppy in when she found herself on a shelter e-list.\n\nLeah and her siblings were found at 2 months last October abandoned in a box behind a gas station in Phoenix.\n\t\nLeah, like many pups is \"mouthy\". With her needle-puppy-teeth she was returned by both the foster and the adopter for non-piercing \"bites\" (ie scratches.) In another month, at 6 months of age, she should have all of her adult teeth in and those teeth will be far easier to deal with!\n\nAHS spayed Leah and made sure she was up to date with her shots. They discovered an umbilical hernia which they also repaired.\n\nWithin hours of her arrival, we discovered that Leah knows \"sit\" and is quickly learning \"stay.\" Leah also knows how to use a doggy door.  She is learning \"no\" and is already becoming less mouthy. She just wants love and hugs.\n\nLeah also knows how to walk on the leash, although she needs further training so as not to pull when excited.\n\nShe loves chewable treats which I am sure helps with her teething.\n\nWe set up a nice crate and bed and she loves relaxing in it!\n\nSince most of our dogs are older and therefore mellower than she is, Leah having a hard time being accepted because she just wants to run and play...like any big puppy would...and they are put off by her energy level. \n\nShe would do wonderfully with a person who likes to hike or run....\n\nLeah is a sweet, loving and intelligent puppy of about 35 lbs and is going to be a big dog. You can tell by looking at her big feet!!\n\nLeah will make someone a delightful family member.\nWe do home checks and reference checks as we want an ideal home for this little girl.",

The only cost the adopter is responsible for is the purchase of a one years supply of heartworm prevention from the participating veterinary clinic. His behavior assessment has been included below.\n\n1.  Kennel Approach \u2013 approaches in a friendly manner. Calm and quiet\n\n2.  Possession \u2013 showed no interest in toys\n\n3.  Touch/Handling \u2013 accepts but does not seek additional contact. He is a bit more reserved. Just seems nervous but no aggression.\n\n4.  Food \u2013 indifferent or friendly. Super happy when bowl hit the ground. Allows you stick the hand in bowl and move it around with no problem.\n\n5.  Correction \u2013 slow to redirect to handler/compliant. Needs work on a leash.\n\n6.  Dominance \u2013 a little timid when being touched, definitely tensed up.\n\n7.  Dog to Dog Intro - tail wags, shows interest, nonchalant\n\n8.  Overall Behavior \u2013 overall good boy. Sweet. Just a bit timid and quiet\n\n Adoption fee includes vaccinations, spay/neuter, heartworm test, and microchip.\n\n\nAvailable for adoption, foster, or rescue at:\n\nJefferson Parish Animal Shelter - Westbank\n2701 Lapalco Blvd; Harvey, LA 70058\n504-349-5111 \n\nPlease provide ID number when visiting shelter.

Miley would do best with a fenced yard, as she has lots of energy and likes to hear herself talk. Not ideal for apartments. She adores human interaction!\n\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\n\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\n\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\n\nSponsor Me! Make a tax-deductible donation today by visiting us at http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/donate/ . Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support!\n\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\n\nPlease \"like\" our\nFacebook Page\nfor the most current events and new dogs.\n\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!",

He enjoys going outside to roam about the yard and roll around the grass. He is almost kind of a little prissy boy with how he prances about the yard. He also at times will fling his feet back all dramatic-like after going potty, like he is clearing the ground. But he uses very exaggerated foot sweeps when he does it. He is the type of dog that will make you laugh and fill you with joy on a daily basis. Bring your dogs and kids to meet Stoney to see if he would be a good match for your family.  \n\nStoney is a 5.5-year-old male Staffordshire terrier that weighs 65 pounds. He is already neutered so he could go home the same day he is adopted and will be microchipped before going home. He is current on his vaccinations, flea, and parasite prevention.",

She gets up from her naps throughout the day to patrol the house and make sure all is well, before taking another nap. She likes a soft bed and a pillow for her head! If you rub her belly she will let you do it all day. She loves stuffed animals, she has two that she plays with and will not destroy. She also loves the rope and the ball. She will run around the yard like a puppy when you play with her. She paws at the door when she has to go outside and when you come home she wags her whole body she is so excited to see you!",

All the other dogs were barking and Shyla was just watching us. Shyla was brought to Florida from Tennessee. The people moved again and just left her and so she was surrendered. She has obviously had puppies recently and has at least a couple mammary tumors that the vet hopes will shrink now that she's been spayed. \nShyla was so quiet because she is mostly deaf but she can hear barks and whistles. She is a very calm dog that just wants to be with you. She wants to see you or she starts looking for you and she goes potty and wants to come right back inside. She seemed to be ok with cats and horses but would probably be better as an only dog. She gets along with other dogs but they seem to pick on her because she is different. She wants to lay beside you and just be wherever you are. If you are looking for a sweet, quiet mellow Velcro dog Shyla may be your girl.",

We process applications ONLY - there is no guarantee that you will get a response to an inquiry.\n\nMEET AVERY:\n\nAvery and her 2 siblings (Adam and Angel) were dropped off at a high-intake shelter and spent over a month of their young life there. Avery is a Great Dane/Lab mix and is estimated to be approximately 6 months old. Avery is a very shy and will need a patient family willing to work with her to boost her confidence. It is evident that she was deprived of that important social interaction when she was much younger and now is leary of humans. It is very important that applicants understand that she will need time, patience and positive reinforcment. It is going to take time for her to become comfortable and consistency is very important. She would benefit from training as that will encourage her to build a strong bond with her owner. She really enjoys the company of other dogs that will engage in play with him and it would be very beneficial for his furever home to have another medium or large breed social dog. She would likely be best in a home without cats. At this time we feel a home with older children would be best as she spooks easily with loud noises and fast actions. Avery is going to grow to be a big girl, maybe not a full Great Dane XL size but he will still be a large dog. She is not a good fit for an apartment, condo or mobile home lifestyle. She will need a family that has some breed knowledge and someone experienced in working with timid and fearful dogs; she is not a goodfit for a first time dog owner. Avery has a great understanding of house manners and is crate trained! She will need continued work with walking on a leash and help building her trust and confidence as he is just now finally getting to experience the big world and enjoying puppy-life! She will need a home where someone is home more often than not as Danes thrive when they are around their people. Avery is a sweet puppy, and although she is fearful at the moment, she will eventually make some lucky family very happy!\n\nAngel is:\nCurrent on Rabies and Distemper\nDewormed\nHeartworm Tested: Negative\nReceiving Heartworm and Flea Prevention\nMicrochipped\nSpayed\n\nADOPTION FEE: $275\n\nFUREVER TAILS IS A NON-PROFIT, NO-KILL, FOSTER HOME BASED ANIMAL RESCUE BASED OUT OF OAKLAND TOWNSHIP, MI. OUR FOSTER ANIMALS ARE LIVING IN FOSTER HOMES AND TREATED LIKE FAMILY UNTIL THEY FIND THEIR OWN FUREVER FAMILIES. OUR ADOPTION PROECESS REQUIRES AN APPLICATION TO BE COMPLETED AND APPROVED BEFORE A MEET-N-GREET WITH THE ANIMAL CAN TAKE PLACE. ADOPTION FEES ARE NECESSARY TO HELP US COVER VETTING COSTS FOR OUR RESCUED ANIMALS. UNFORTUNATELY AT THIS TIME WE ARE NOT CURRENTLY ADOPTING OUT OF THE STATE OF MI.",

When we met him last weekend it was like he was a brand-new dog! He was still nervous, but he interacted well with volunteers and loved the extra attention he was getting. He sits for treats and walks well on a leash. He did not care one bit about the cats nearby. We will temperament test him with dogs at a later date once he has relaxed a bit more.",

            "description": "Ramble is funny, lovable, smart boy. He is a 1 year/19lb/Terrier Mix. He's big enough to be durable, and he's still small enough to fit just about anywhere.\n\nThis dog is a sweetheart who absolutely loves affection. Ramble fell in love with my 10 year old daughter almost immediately. The feeling was mutual. My daughter says he's her favorite foster so far (and I've had 9 others during the past year). Ramble has been wonderful with her.\n\nHe can actually be quite the ham when he wants attention, and he's got a flair for the dramatic (in the best possible way). He loves playing with his toys and will toss them in the air and fling them across the room on his own. He's a huge clown.\n\nBecause Ramble is a young, playful dog, he will sometimes grab something he shouldn't have - like a discarded paper towel, or a ziplock bag, sock, etc. - and proceed to play \"keep away\" while the humans try to take it from him. And he's totally laughing at the humans the entire time they're chasing him. But he hasn't tried to destroy any of the things he's put in his mouth.\n\nRamble is good in his crate, and he's been good about going outside to potty. If not taken out fairly quickly after being let out of his crate in the morning, he will lift his leg in the house, but he hasn't actually peed on anything yet. So far, a verbal correction has been enough to prevent any accidents.\n\nHe has been fully vetted. He tested very light positive for heartworms, so we opted for the slow-kill method. He was given a ProHeart injection and will be heartworm negative by the time he needs his next ProHeart.\n\nHail Mary Rescue, a 501c3 non profit, saves dogs from southeast Louisiana shelters. It is a foster-based rescue which gives pets the opportunity to live in home settings where they are house and crate trained, learn basic obedience commands, and are well socialized, many with children and other dogs. Exposure to cats depends on the foster's home. Adoption fee is $200 for LA adoptions; $400 (includes transportation fee for out-of-state adoptions). All dogs are completely vetted, vaccinated, spay/neutered, and micro-chipped prior to adoption. See your new best friend?

Do you miss your \"bro's\" in your new life as an adult? Look no further because Greggor is the answer! This dude is literally a frat boy in a dog and he needs YOU! \n\nGreggor arrived this month after finding himself at an overfull shelter over the holidays. He is a sweet goober of a dog who, for reasons we cannot understand, kept being overlooked. He is happy-go-lucky despite being confused after weeks of sitting in the shelter environment. He is a huge boy who has no idea his large size and just wants to play and cuddle. He will make an amazing companion for camping, hiking, fishing and other outdoor activities and adventures where his XL size and oafish nature won't get in the way, aka this isn't your stealthy hunting champion. Despite being the complete package Greggor still needs your help! He needs a foster or adoptive home immediately. If interested in helping this deserving lug please contact us!! \n\nTo Contact Us\n\nMessage us through our website http://www.highplainspaw.org\n\nMessage the Facebook Page at https://www.facebook.com/HighPlainsPAW\n\nFill out our Adoption Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/adoption-application\n\nFill out our Foster Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/foster-application\n\nEmail us at highplainspaw@gmail.com\n\nCall our VOICEMAIL at (402)957-1578\n\n $200.00 Adoption Fee \n(Which is considered a non refundable donation and being we are a 501c3 organization it is tax deductible. The fee itself is not negotiable, our vets don't negotiate and thus neither do we.)\n\nWE DO NOT HAVE A FACILITY ALL OUR DOGS ARE LOCATED IN FOSTER HOMES. This means there is no place for you to go in person to view our dogs. We ask that an application be filled out and we will go from there!",

            "description": "Please read this description carefully before submitting an application for Sonny. There are specific requirements that his new owners need to have in order for him to be successul.\n\nSonny came to us from North Carolina where he was found as a stray in November and he was terrified of people. You could see that he was curious and wanted to trust but it was obvious that he had never been handled by a person in his first 8 months of life. He is just under a year oldl and has made incredible progress in his foster home assisted by his two confident dog mentors and awesome people, but he will most likely always be cautious and very timid around anyone new. Once he learns to trust you, he is the sweetest, most playful, exhuberant pup around! He LOVES other dogs and we feel that he will do best with a confident, playful, tolerant dog of similar size who can be his new mentor. He follows the lead of other dogs and is learning how to navigate the world with their guidance. We will be prioritizing homes with another dog in place so this can continue. Sonny also needs people who understand dog behavior and can coach new people he meets on how to approach him properly and earn his trust. He needs a confident, kind leader and his new new people need to have experience with timid dogs or to be willing to learn. He is still young and is SO curious, you can see that Sonny wants to grow and trust, he just needs someone who will continue to work with him and expose him to the world so he can move past his fears. We would also strongly recommend working with a trainer who can guide this process so Sonny can find success. He doesn't have a mean bone in his body and there have been no signs of any negative behavior towards people or other dogs. He has never met a cat so that is completely unknown. Even though he is perfectly safe, we don't feel he would do well with young children due to their energy and unpredictability. Sonny is easily scared and needs a quieter home where he can learn to trust. He is very active and athletic but he gets fearful of new people out on walks and defaults to returning home. Until he can move beyond that, a securely fenced yard would be best to allow him to get his energy out. He LOVES playing with toys and interacting with his humans. He is fully housebroken and he is BEYOND adorable. He is a perfect medium size, around 50 pounds, and has very good manners in the home. He is crate trained and is gaining confidence by the day. Please contact us if you feel you are a good fit for Sonny. We plan to take the process of acclimating him to his new home slowly and will most likely need to do several meet and greets at his house and yours so out of state applications will not be considered. Sonny is being fostered in Chesire, CT. Send any questions to info@spottydogrescue.org",

She would thrive in an active, suburban home able to help her burn energy daily. She loves to play hard with her foster brother, so if there is another pup in the home, they would need an energetic play style to match. Scout knows her basic commands and would love to continue working on these. She can be a bit mouthy when excited, so a home with older kids would be ideal for her. She is still working on her manners, but with a little work she will make a family very happy. She is a gem just waiting for her forever people! \n\nPlease Note: All dogs are posted until they are officially adopted. This dog may have other interested adopters in line. If you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application on our website at www.lasthopek9.org.",

I was found as a stray in the city of Harrisburg. I am a beautiful girl that LOVES to be on the go. I will need a family that is quite active and has the time to help me learn. I can get quite over stimulated when excited and am not always easy to calm down. I can get mouthy and jumpy, so a strong leader is best. A home with kids over 12 years old is best for now! I like to play ball and I will bring it back for you to throw. I do know sit and capable of learning much more! A somewhat experienced family would be best due to the training I will need. I will need to be your only pet as I was not fond of the cat I met or the dog. I tend to be very forward and tense when being sniffed. I did coexist well on a walk, but very uncomfortable when the other dog invaded my space. I think with proper socialization I will be a better fit for another dog friend, but for now I would do best as your one and only! Trust me, I am plenty!",

This gorgeous brindle bombshell is about 3 years old and is such a people pleaser. She came to us when her beloved daddy passed away and family couldn't care for her. She is wonderful with all people but would prefer to be the only animal in her forever home. She doesn't need to be crated for the work day and is house trained. Brindie is a lover who now needs someone who will help heal her broken heart. Please fill out an application and meet this girl today.\n\nwww.mobilemuttsrescue.org",

            "description": "Hi, my name is Hazelhurst! I am a Black and Tan Coonhound that was born on 4/12/2020. I was surrendered to the shelter because I had been used as a breeder dog but wasn't needed any longer so they chose to have me find a home instead. I am a shy dog and in need of socialization. A fenced in yard would be ideal as I cannot be trusted loose outside. I'll need a patient home while I learn what it's like to be a house dog with a family of my own. Apply for me today!\n\nMy adoption fee is $60.00. Adoption applications can be filled out at CCHS or online through our website, www.cchs-petshelter.org. Applications are not first come, first served. All applications will be reviewed by the adoption committee and the home chosen will be the one considered to be the best match. All dogs and puppies have been vaccinated for Distemper and Bordetella, dewormed and microchipped. If old enough, they will be vaccinated for Rabies and blood tested for Heartworm, Lymes, Anaplasmosis and Erlichiosis. Dogs and puppies will be spayed or neutered before adoption.\n\nCCHS is proud to be a No-Kill Humane Society. As a private, non-profit charity, our work depends on donations and volunteers to keep going. We are committed to helping the animals that enter our doors and finding each the best possible forever home. CCHS has been inspected and licensed by the Department of Animal Health - DATCP. Our license is #268235-DS",

He absolutely loves being outside and playing fetch. He loves to catch snowballs and can catch a snowball and frisbee in mid air! He also is a good snuggler when you are watching your favorite show. Unfortunately Tucker will tear up a pet bed, but he is pretty good about leaving other things alone when you are with him. He is crate trained as well. Tucker is neutered and up to date on shots.",

He can walk on a leash near other dogs, sometimes even touch noses, but off leash he does not understand that he needs to stay out of other dogs faces and has been attacked. Only experienced dog owners and we will thoroughly background check to keep Tucker safe. He also pulls on a leash and will jump on people, so needs to go to a home with no kids AND NO DOG PARKS.",

Sonny\u2019s mom got really sick and passed away after being in hospice care for a while. Some kind neighbors took this little man in and are determined to find a home to love him in his twilight years.\u00a0\n\nSonny is pretty healthy with no recurring issues. He has a healthy appetite and gets around well as long as he doesn\u2019t have to use stairs (they scare him).\u00a0\n\nHe is not house broken and has outright refused to use puppy pads, but with a home that has easy access to the backyard with no stairs (or the ability to carry him up and down them) he could hopefully learn!\n\nSonny is a lap dog and loves chilling on the couch with his person. He gets along ok with dogs and kids, and he doesn\u2019t make much noise.\u00a0He does seem to have some issues with his teeth and would benefit from a good cleaning.\u00a0\n\nHe is UTD on shots, on HW preventative, and neutered.\n\nHis adoption donation is $100.00.\n\nIf you are interested in the above dog, please do not email us and tell us that you are interested, but submit an adoption application. The link for the application is below.\n\nTo submit an application go here\u2026\u2026chihuahua-rescue.com/adoption-application/\n\nAn application must be submitted and approved before a meet-n-greet can be scheduled.\n\nYour current dogs/cats must be spayed or neutered unless a veterinarian has determined that your current pet(s) should not be fixed due to medical reasons. They must also be up-to-date on shots and on HW preventative.\n\nReference checks and a home visit are required so SE dogs can only be adopted in NC/SC, TN, AL, VA, MD and GA.",

I am a 6-year-old, male, Siberian Husky who is eager for a new home!\n\nThe first thing you'll probably notice about me are my eyes. Boy are they a crystal-clear blue!! All the better to adore you with! It's easy to feel a strong connection with me quick, because I love eye contact and sharing that bond (and it's pretty hard to look away from me--the ability to mesmerize is my superpower!). \n\nI'm a lot of fun to be around too. I'm very active, love to run, and would love to have someone to jog with. I also like to relax, and just cuddle up with you. I bond deeply to my people. I do want a home with adults and older teens--kids and younger teens might not be able to read some of my body language as well!\n\nSo if you're looking for an adventure, I'm your boy. I'll go on every hike, beach trip, and road trip with you that you like! \n\nReady to adopt or want to hear more about me? The shelter is open by appointment seven days a week! Just email adopt@sbhumanesociety.org to make an appointment today!\n\nWhen you take your new pet home, he or she will have been spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccinations, provided with a permanent microchip identification and a certificate for a free veterinary exam. Our partners at Purina brand dog and cat food also provide food to get you home. \n\nTransfer of animals may be available between our Santa Maria and Santa Barbara Campuses. If an animal you would like to meet is at the campus further away from you, just let us know when you email, and we will be in touch with you if a transfer is available. Our adoption fees hel",

We wish he could tell us exactly what happened, but he's not talking. We do know that he was at PACC all the way back in 2016, so he's not too thrilled to be back here again. Despite his condition, Zoltan has been very friendly and affectionate to the people he's met at the shelter, and has been easy to walk. He spent some time in a temporary home and we learned that he's housetrained and loves to sleep on the couch or with his person. While Zoltan is a lover of people, he's a little choosier when it comes to other dogs, so we recommend a meet-and-greet with any resident pups. Zoltan is a sweet boy who would love to get out of the shelter and into a home. If he sounds like your type of guy, he's ready to head home with you today!",

A meeting can be arranged for approved applicants. \n \nOnce we have reviewed your application we will get back to you as soon as possible. \nWe have the right to decline an application if it is not a good fit for that particular animal. \n \n__________________\n\nThis handsome boy is Simba.  He is an 18 month old Great Pyrenees.  He is a pet and NOT a working Great Pyrenees.  He prefers the couch and will chase all types of farm animals.   :)\nHe was turned into a rural kill shelter because he was not a good fit for apartment life.  He is about 85lbs but is a bit thin and needs to gain some weight.\nHe walks great on a leash and knows how to sit.\nHe is a big boy and does get excited when playing and may be too much for small children under 10 years of age.\n\nWe are looking for a new home for Simba that has Great Pyrenees experience and/or knowledgeable about the quirky breed and has a secure fenced in yard.  No exceptions....please!\nDue to the virus and state restrictions we are not doing out of state adoptions for Simba.  Also, a home visit is required for adoption for this boy.\n\n \n\n\nAny questions about Simba, please contact his foster Mom at kittypuppylv@aol.com\n\n_________________________\n\n\nNot yet ready to adopt? You can sponsor a pet now to help pay for medical expenses, special diets, toys and treats, emergency medical care, etc., to provide for him or her during foster care. Our adoption fee rarely covers our expenses, so any size donation is appreciated! Click the Sponsor Me! logo to make a donation. You can also donate by check or Paypal by visiting our website at www.cofas.org \n\n\n All of our dogs are fostered in our homes so we know their temperaments. They are spayed or neutered, up to date on shots, de-wormed, heartworm tested (and treated if necessary), and on flea and heartworm prevention. Our adoption fee begins at $195.00 for all of our dogs and puppies. Our goal is to match our animals to the best home possible. Please email info@cofas.org for more information. You can also fill out an application at www.cofas.org",

This happy-go-lucky girl is ready to find her forever home and will forever bring joy and laughter with her. Tootsie is such a lovebug, who came in with her baby, and is now ready to start her new life! She will need a little work on the leash, and keeps her kennel clean. Come on out and meet this sassy sweet Tootsie today and you won't be able to leave without her!\n\nDue to Covid, we now work by appointment only and work on a first come basis.  If you are interested in making an appointment, please call the HCHS at 512-793-5463.  You can see all our available animals at HillCountryHumaneSociety.org.\nAll our adoptable dogs are treated for fleas, given DHPPV and Bordatella vaccines and are de-wormed.  \nWhen you adopt one of our animals it will be micro chipped and registered at the time of adoption.  Also, if not already altered, you will receive a voucher to get your animal spay/neutered.\nWhile we do our best to determine the breeds of our dogs, the majority are strays, and we have only general appearance, coat type, size, ear type, tail, tongue color and coat color to base breed on.  It is always possible when adopting a puppy that it will change dramatically to look like another breed.\n",

            "description": "A word from Lillith herself:\n\nHi! \nMy name is Lilith, but my foster family calls me  Lilly or Lilly Beans. They have all kinds of funny nicknames for the doggos here, so I\u2019ll take it as a compliment. I am a one year old Husky/German Shepherd mix girl searching for this thing that my foster mom calls a forever family. You see, I thought I had one and had a great time chasing the chickens at my first home and that made my mom and dad really upset because I killed some of them. I didn\u2019t mean to hurt them, but something just takes over me and I chase fast moving things. My foster mom tells me that\u2019s why I can\u2019t play with the kitties in my foster home. I haven\u2019t hurt the kitties but I\u2019m super excited to see them and chase them and that makes my foster mom nervous given my chicken killing past. She says that my forever home can\u2019t have any kitties just to keep everyone safe. And that\u2019s ok by me as long as I have some nice people, kids and even friendly doggos to play with me. I love my doggy foster brothers and sisters and my foster mom says I am all crazy husky in my play and I play rough like a big dog. I\u2019m very noisy in my play and that can be scary for some people, but I really get into my play. I do tend to get bossy, so my new doggy brother or sister will have to be ok with that. It can be a bit much for some doggies I am told. You see, my foster family has a female husky too and my foster mom tells me that she\u2019s the alpha. I don\u2019t know what that means but I always try to push her buttons to see if I can be in charge. So I guess I\u2019m just trying to see if I can be as cool and in charge as she is. Who would think that a GIRL husky could be in charge of two big boy huskies? Cool right? I want to be just like her! So I got a little off track. I was talking about kids too, not just doggo siblings. My foster family has two big kids that my foster mom says are teenagers and I think they are pretty swell because they are big enough to bounce and play with me and I don\u2019t have to worry about knocking them over when I get the zoomies. My foster mom thinks I may be best with bigger kids or at least sturdy enough for me to really play, because man o man do I love to play! AND my kids even let me sleep in their bed! That\u2019s the best, I love sleeping with the people, and they tell me I\u2019m a good girl and I don\u2019t hog the bed. I really like to spend as much time as I can with my family and I get nervous when my people leave. It\u2019s pretty awesome that my foster mom is working from home right now because of covid so I don\u2019t have to be home alone all day, and I may like a family like that for my forever family. I will go in a kennel when my family has to go out for something, but it\u2019s not really my favorite. They say it\u2019s to make sure I stay safe because I get nervous when they leave. It\u2019s not so bad I guess. Oh, that brings me to my other thing that my foster mom calls my quirk. So I have figured out I can jump a 4\u2019 fence to go find my family if they\u2019re in the front yard and I\u2019m in the back or sometimes just for fun to go play with the neighbor\u2019s dog. My mom says I\u2019ll need at least a 6\u2019 fence to keep me from trying to play catch me if you can. I think it\u2019s a fun game, but my foster dad didn\u2019t think it was very fun when he was home sick and I did it. OOPS ???? total doggy face palm moment. \nAll in all my foster mommy says I\u2019m a really sweet, lovable and sassy girl, I just need to find a great family who will love me and help me grow into the great doggo I should be. My foster dad says I have just enough Shepherd in me to be super smart and trainable overriding my crazy carefree huskiness and I have a natural instinct to want to protect my family. Did I mention I LOVE my people? They are seriously the best! But my foster mom says I have to find a great forever family of my own so she can help save other dogs just like me. \nIf you think I sound like a great girl for you, please fill out the adoption application and send it to Cindy and Paula that run the rescue. They say I am spayed, up to date on my vaccinations, heart worm prevention, flea and tick prevention, microchipped and ready to go home. I just need my family to find me.  Could it be you?",

            "description": "Breed:  Schnauzer / Yorkie mix\nAge:  6 yrs.\nWeight:  16 lbs.\nGood with dogs:  dog selective\nGood with cats:  unsure\nGood with kids:  12 yrs. +\nEnergy level:  low\nGood with men/strangers:  yes\nHypoallergenic:  no\n\nSpecial home requirements or medical:  none\n\nAdditional info:\n\nKarloff is doing well in his foster home.   We are still getting to know him but so far he has been a very friendly boy that loves hanging out with his person and  does not like to be fussed over too much. He is pretty mellow and likes to be taken out for regular walks. He does have some minor leash aggression and is dog selective as he was attacked by a dog in the past.   He seems to prefer calm dogs that are closer to his size, but ultimately may prefer being the only dog in the home. He may be able to live with another dog if it's the right fit.   This may take some patience and time on the human's part and willingness to work with the dogs to help them bond. \n\nHe is housetrained and he will be fine in a home with children that are older (12 yrs.+) that can understand to give him space. Karloff is not crate trained and will bark pretty loudly.   We aren't sure about separation anxiety as his foster has not yet left him alone. He is also low shedding, but not hypoallergenic. Overall, he is an easy going dog that just needs the right person to work with his fears of other dogs.\n\nIf you are not ready to adopt just yet and would like to help in other ways, please consider clicking on the green \u201cSponsor Me\u201d button above to help this dog receive the best care we can give. We rely on the generosity of others to make rescuing dogs possible.\n\nIF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING THIS DOG, PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU HAVE READ THE DOG'S INFORMATION CAREFULLY.

He is definitely one of a kind meaning he is a bit opinionated.  Poor Sammy- we pulled him from a shelter in South Louisiana after he had been returned to this shelter for snapping.  So let me explain this man in the best way possible- he is a young dog with a grumpier old man soul! He is super amazing with all of us at BARK.  He gets so excited when he sees the leash and he is always up for playing with other dogs.  We love watching him run around with his doggie friends.  He is very afraid of new people especially men.   He needs to be adopted by family with either no children or grown children that has a household with consistency on a daily basis.  Sammy is definitely a dog that likes and appreciates the same daily routines.  I honestly feel that Sammy is going to make a wonderful pet but we have to find the right home for him and his potential adopters.  We know there is a family out there for this stellar stud muffin, we just have to find the right fit.  If you think you might be the one to adopt him, please email us at Longj1003@aol.com and katybug6067@gmail.com. Thanks for opting to adopt.",

After a very long surgery to remove them all, he unfortunately lost an eye.  He was already very underweight so it took him awhile to recover.  At first he was so weak, he could not even go for a walk!  Now that he has put on weight and recovered from his ordeal, he acts as though nothing ever happened and is full of puppy love and energy! Tigger absolutely loves everyone he meets and will try to give hugs and kisses; he even loves the vet! He is very food-motivated and very smart so he thrives on training time.  He only knows a few commands but with a dedicated person to help guide him, he will become a model doggy citizen in no time!\nAccording to his DNA results, Tigger is Lab, Rotti, Chow and \u2018other.\u2019  In the other, we believe he has some type of herding breed because he will chase trucks if he has a chance.  We think there may also be some Kangaroo because this boy can jump!  He doesn\u2019t jump on people but jumps straight into the air likes he\u2019s on a pogo stick.  He would be a great candidate for agility training.  Tigger does have a high prey drive so NO cats or small animals in the home.  He MUST have a 6ft or higher, securely fenced yard.  Because of his high energy, kids must be over 10yrs old, and he must have an active family that will take him on plenty of jogs and hiking trips.  Play dates with other large dogs are a must... or even another young, playful dog in the home would be ideal.  \n \n",

I can be a bit of a nervous guy with new things but a sure do love my dog buddies.  Small kids scare me so I would do best with older children.  I am incredibly submissive and just want to please you! \nI'm a pretty versatile guy.  I love to run and play in the yard with friends, I enjoy walks and I equally enjoy the couch potato life.  Hot dogs are my favorite and is all you need to win me over.  I really would do best as a companion for another dog in the house.  They make me happy and comfortable.  \n\nSeth is fostering in Antioch IL. His adoption fee is $350. Please apply at www.ruffluckdogrescue.com",

The nice shelter staff loved me so much, they put out a plea to find me a foster home or rescue. Now I am in the care of Rejection Collection Boxer Rescue and settling into my foster home.\n\nI am a happy go lucky, loving boy. When I get excited I tend to get a bit mouthy and/or licky. I don't bite down or anything, I just get so excited I don't know how to contain myself.\n\nI am potty trained, do fine in a crate, and enjoy exploring the fenced in yard. I am still learning the ropes in my foster home. My foster mom says I am doing really well, I just need to brush up on a few manners. I am a smart boy and seem to learn quickly if you take the time to teach me.\n\nI am getting to know my little foster fur sister, Micka. I like her so much I want to play rough and box her in the face. I like licking her face and sometimes try to start mouth wrestling. My foster mom usually stops me because I am bigger and a bit too much for Micka. Maybe once she gets used to me she'll try to wrestle back.\n\nThere are two kitties in my foster home. So far I am VERY curious, to the point that I am obsessed. I have tried to chase one of the kitties and would like to taste him. I don't understand why that's so bad? Based on my intense behavior so far, my foster mom says that I would probably do best in a home without cats or small critters.The shelter said I do well with female dogs, but prefer to be the only male. My initial age estimate was about 8 years, but the RCBR vet thinks I might be closer to 6 years old. My foster mom says I do seem to have the energy of a younger dog. I say age is just a number anyway.\n\nStay tuned for more updates as my foster family gets to know me.\n\nLove,\nBilly",

Tulip came to OPK from another shelter, and spent some time in foster care learning all about the wonderful life of a beloved family pet! She is a well mannered girl who is always ready to see what adventures the day will bring. \n\nTulip is a sweet-natured canine whose \"ready to go\" demeanor would fit perfectly with any active household. She is a moderate energy dog, and would love for her family to take her on long walks at the park each day. This spunky girl always loves toys, and enjoys romping around with her favorite ball in the backyard! Tulip has lived with cats previously, and is well behaved around her feline friends. \n\nAfter a day of play and fun, Tulip loves to curl up on a dog bed and chew on a good bone. Tulip's foster home indicates she is house broken and crate trained. This sweet girl can become overwhelmed easily with a lot of hustle and bustle in the home, and would prefer a quiet, adult only home.

            "description": "If you live an active lifestyle, Kate is ready to be your best friend and loyal companion! Already having a great recall off-leash, she has huge potential to be the perfect dog for an outdoor enthusiast who can give her the exercise she needs daily to be at her best. If you love all of the traits of a border collie...smart, spunky, energetic, attaches quickly to family, and a big cuddler....then Kate is your girl! \n\nKate is shy and hesitant upon first meeting new people and new dogs, but she opens up with time and then just wants to hang by your side. She needs time and space so she can check out new things on her own schedule. She is skeptical and afraid around new noises and movement, like walking near a busy road, so patience and training exercises would really help her gain some confidence. We have no doubt she will get there with time, as she has already made huge improvements since arriving in her foster home two weeks ago. She plays well with the resident dog (a large male hound) but she is more interested in what her humans are doing. She does like to steal toys from doggy friends, so she would be best suited to a dog who doesn't mind sharing. She is happy to nap at our feet while we are on work calls, but she is not the type of dog who will nap all day. She would do best in a home where her family is with her for a good part of the day as she can get anxious when she is alone. \n\nShe has some adorable mannerisms, like bouncing with excitement after a ball and turning her head dramatically to listen to new noises. Her curiosity has gotten her into some interesting situations and has had us laughing hysterically with her antics. She would do well if she was given a \"job\" and wasn't left to her own devices, at least for the first few months until she settles in. When she's tired, she is a true cuddle bug and is an A+ snuggler. She will sleep in her crate with the door open, but we haven't graduated to closing the crate door yet. She rarely barks and hasn't tried to hop over our 3.5 foot outdoor fenced space. She is currently attending a level 1 life skills class and is a quick study, very eager to please her humans. She would be an absolute rockstar at herding trials, agility, flyball or another dog sport. In a former home she did great with kids. I expect she would be shy at first and then friendly especially if they have a ball to throw for her to chase! She hasn't been tested around cats.\n\nKate is going to be a fabulous dog for someone who loves to hike, run, bike, ski, or otherwise spend time outside and have her tag along! Although she needs some training in the short-term, we have no doubt she will learn quickly and will be an extremely rewarding dog.

He is young, friendly, and loves to play but due to some guarding issues he needs a home with no young children and an owner willing to commit to training. Felix seems to like other dogs but needs to be the only king in the castle at this time. He has a lot of playful energy and would do best in a home with a big yard and someone to play with. If you are looking for a cute and spunky small dog ask about Mr Felix. If interested in Felix, contact us via Email @ animalshelter@islipny.gov or by phone @ (631)224-5660 ?

Thank you!****\n\nDraco is a young yellow Lab mix that is full of energy and joy. He was passed over at the shelter for almost two months, we're not really sure why. While he is young and a little stubborn he is as sweet as they come. He is most happy playing with his dog friends. He loves to be part of a big play group where he romp and play. He needs a little work on manners and we're hoping Paws in Prison will be the spot for that. \n\n\nDraco is fully vaccinated, microchipped, and neutered. His adoption fee is $250.\n\nDraco is in the Paws in Prison program where he receives obedience training. He will graduate from Paws in Prison on 3/20/2021.  The dogs in this program are trained under the AKC Canine Good Citizen standards and are specifically selected to be family and companion dogs. They spend 24 hours a day with their trainers. For that reason, they will do best in homes where they are primarily inside dogs and spend lots of time with their families. The adoptive family will receive his training journal. This journal documents his arrival from the shelter, daily training progress, and interactions with the trainers.\n\nCARE's adoptable pets are specifically evaluated and selected to be family and companion animals. We place them in foster homes where they live in the home environment and become part of the family while awaiting permanent adoption. For that reason, they will do best in homes where they are primarily inside pets and spend lots of time with their families.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Draco or learning more about the adoption process, please submit an online adoption application at careforanimals.org. Thank you!",

I love being outside on adventures; hiking is my favorite, especially in the snow.  My new home must be an active home, more than just a weekend warrior.  Just like all huskies, I am a talker and like to talk back when I am told no.  My ideal home will have another younger dog as I love to play.  My foster mom says I play with my new friends all day long.  If you are an active family looking to add a sweet girl to your pack, I could be your girl.  Please apply at www.odaatcolorado.com.",

Our phone number is 618-665-3005. The shelter is open to the public 1-3 Monday-Saturday. Sundays we are open 1-4 to the public. If those times don't work, please call to set up a time to visit.\n\nThe typical adoption fee for dogs is $150. It includes vaccination, deworming , spay/neuter, heartworm testing on dogs of age and microchipping, which is now mandatory by state law. Some dogs we discount to as little as $50 due to sponsorship. Some dogs we ask a higher adoption fee, which helps us recoup expenses on heartworm treatment on other dogs.\n\nAll cats are spayed/neutered/vaccinated/flea treated/dewormed and microchipped prior to adoption. Cat adoption fees range from $60-$100. We spay/neuter/microchip/vaccinate and deworm all kittens and cats, prior to adoption. Our shyer/less adoptable cats are classed as \"barn cats\" and are free with a completed/approved barn cat application, which can be found on our website.\n\nFor updates on adoption events and more pics of pets available, go to our website, www.claycountyshelter.com or look for us on Facebook.",

Although he is able-bodied, the accident left him with internal injuries that rendered him incontinent. This means Binx ALWAYS WEARS A DIAPER unless he\u2019s outside. This is no big deal and doesn\u2019t slow him down at all. \n\n*Binx is looking for an active family who will include him in all of their adventures (road trips, brewery outings, camping, hanging out with the neighbors). He\u2019s a busy body outdoors and then a super snuggler indoors. He craves physical touch and wants to be your constant companion. He would love other canine companions but would be just as happy if he was your one and only. If you have children to give him extra lovies, that would be even better!\n\nAlbert's Dog Lounge is a transporting dog rescue, meaning that we rescue many of our dogs from high kill shelters in areas of dog overpopulation. We are a specialty rescue focusing primarily on senior and special needs dogs.  The vast majority of our dogs come from the Houston, TX area where we have an entire team of volunteers, coordinators, and fosters. We do also work with local shelters, rescues, and owners.  If you apply for a dog that is currently in our local Houston program, we will work to get your dog transported to WI as quickly as possible. We ask that you have patience during this time of uncertainty and unprecedented dog adoptions nationwide. \n\nLearn more about Albert's Dog Lounge, our mission, and adoption policies by visiting Albertsdoglounge.org. \n\nOur process includes an approved application, reference checks, a homevisit, and then a meet and greet with the dog. Adoption fee is $275.\n\nBegin your application process by copying this link into your web browser: https://www.albertsdoglounge.org/apply\n\nWI Dept. Of Agriculture License Number: 474085-DS",

He was transferred to them by Gila County Animal Control. Kingston has a long list of medical issues to be addressed to include Thyroid, Heart Murmer, bad teeth, and Cushing's disease. Kingston is a gentle soul. He knows how to use the doggie door and is good on a leash for short walks. This boy is a perfect gentleman around other friendly dogs and is an easy keeper. We are currently getting him vetted to include making sure his medication levels are correct for his Cushings disease and then determining whether he is at the point where he can be neutered and given a dental. We estimate he will become available around March 1st assuming his treatment plan is completed. His ideal adoptive home loves senior dogs and is willing and able to pick up his expensive heart and Cushing's medications. 1/30/21 7:07 PM",

He had a large & painful open wound on his face that is now all healed. He was scared and a little unsure of us at first but is feeling better and is much happier now that he knows he is safe. Luke is very sweet but is a little hand shy and may have had a bit of a rough past so we believe he would do best in a home with older or no kids. He needs a loving owner willing to give him time to get comfortable in his new home. Luke enjoys affection, walks nicely on the leash, and knows some basic commands. He would love a yard to play in & needs to be the only dog in the home.  If interested in Luke , contact us via Email @ animalshelter@islipny.gov  ? LIKE & SHARE to get him a home!\n",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Bentley is a 6 year old rat terrier mix! He was abandoned by his owners and set for euthanasia. Bentley is the cutest and the most Sweetest boy in the whole world! He is sight impaired due to a congenital defect but that doesn't stop him one bit! We believe Bentley can see shadows as he doesn't run into anything and he knows exactly where you are at all times but the object has to be very close for him to even see that! Unfortunately he was also found to be heart-worm positive but he is such a nice dog people rallied for him and therefore rescue was able to step in! A dog like Bentley is not one we can resist so we were very excited to save him and we have NOT been disappointed!\n\nBentley is the type of dog that just makes you fall in love with him! He captured the hearts of so many people in Texas. He then went to a medical foster in Tennessee so he could be treated for heart worm where everyone just fell head over heels in love with him again (Including the vet staff who treated him)! He has been a foster favorite everywhere he has went. After all his traveling We are hoping he can can finally find a place to call Home.\n\nBentley is fostered with other dogs and is fine with everyone he meets. He doesn't have a mean bone in his little body. He obviously can't really play but he can follow the pack and join in the group for treat time. He is able to do a few stairs on his own and is so smart he even learned how to come in the doggy door when he is done! Bentley loves to be talked to and will talk back - especially if you tell him he's handsome! The higher pitched your voice goes the more he talks and that tail just goes a mile a minute!\n\nBentley has been around a 9 year old child and really loved her but we would prefer he goes to a quieter home as we think young active kids full time would just be a lot for him. Bentley takes treats nicely, he loves cheese, he LOVES car rides and sits so nicely (shotgun of course)! He is perfectly crate trained- every now and then he will bark but if you tell him no he settles nicely. We are working on housebreaking. He is newly neutered and he did mark when he first came. He is improving now that he understands the routine and knows there the door is. We would suggest a belly band until he settles into his new home and routine with you!\n\nThis little dog has been through so much and has met so many new people who have helped him along the way. He has embraced every change in his life and there have been so many! He truly loves everyone and is so grateful for anything you do for him, every sweet word you say to him and every kind pet he gets! He loves couch time and he is one of the most deserving dogs of a forever family! Please don't let his impairment get in the way of adopting him. Bentley is treated like every other dog in his foster home and does perfectly fine. If you think your family and home are a match for this sweet boy please apply!\n\nBentley is neutered, up to date with vaccines, microchipped, flea/worm treated and treated for heartworm disease. He will need to stay on monthly heartworm prevention for the rest of his life. His adoption fee is $350",

If you don't already know - I have a glowing, vivacious personality, affection for days, an I am undeniably one of the prettiest gals you've ever seen. The shelter life limits my ongoing craving for mental and physical stimulation, though. I need an active family that is interested in helping me learn new things. I love most other dogs, and it would be great to have an in-home \"bestie\". I can be a \"scaredy cat\" around cats, so I'm opting out of a feline roommate. Although I'm still quite young, I know I would be best in a home with adults and older kids. If you've got what I need, call NAHS at 630-420-8989 to learn more and maybe even schedule an appointment to meet me.",

This girl is beyond sweet and can't wait to have fun with you.\n\nLorelei is house trained and crate trained, and will sleep there when prompted. She walks well on leash too! This affectionate dog loves pets and snuggles and will work hard to get them. She's good with kids, and will even let strangers approach her (because it means she gets more pets!) She is more hesitant approaching other dogs, but not aggressive. If greeted properly, she will get along with them just fine.\n\nLast fall, Lorelei was hit by a car and is still recovering, so she has a small wobble. The vet says it will heal completely in time, and she has no trouble running and climbing stairs. She's looking for a forever home who will help her recuperate and flourish. Could that home be yours?\n\nIf you are interested in adding this pup to your family, please submit an application at www.petrescuealliance.com.

He'll walk around sniffing for as long as you let him- that is until he decides it's time for zoomies! He's still figuring out how to play with toys though. He'll run after a toy when you throw it unless he gets distracted by more things to sniff. Oren may be a Hound mix, but his soul is that of a Husky! If you know about Huskies, you know that they love to sing for you. Oren is no different! He loves to sing and talk to you, so he's probably not the best fit for an apartment life. If you have another dog, Oren would love to meet them! He got along well with the dogs that he's met here at the shelter. He also met a cat and mostly just wanted to sniff him. Oren is about 3 years old and weighs 40 pounds. \n\nIf you are interested in meeting this pet, please contact Chesterfield County Animal Services at (804) 748-1683, option \"0\", to schedule an appointment. Office staff are available by phone Monday-Friday 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. and Saturday 7:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. The shelter is located at 9300 Public Works Road, Chesterfield, VA 23832.",

            "description": "Jim is an adult Pyr boy who\u2019s looking for a new start on life. Jim was rescued as a stray and needed to be shaved due to severe matting. His rough start hasn\u2019t stopped him from being a very sweet boy though who wants to be inside with his humans most of the time. Jim is doing great with his house manners. He\u2019s not a counter surfer though he can be found curiously running his nose along tabletops and couches looking for goodies left behind :) Needless to say, Jim is very food motivated, which should make continued training a bit easier. Like the rest of us, Jim isn\u2019t having too many visitors these days, but he\u2019s learning not to jump up when greeting new human friends. He could also use some work on his leash skills. Though Jim prefers to be inside, he loves to play with his canine pals and would enjoy a dog sibling to show him the ropes in his new home. Jimmy is quite serious, in an endearing kind of way, but he loves to be hugged and petted! He\u2019s very patient and obedient when his humans need him to be still and he\u2019s very good in the car. Jimmy is an easy-going guy who is a delight to have around. He will make a wonderful addition to a committed and loving family!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nNGPR dogs are in foster homes throughout the U.S., NOT Beacon, NY. View full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.\n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

You'd never know it now though except for a small square of bare skin along his back! Now that he's healthy, Ramon would love to find his forever home! Ramon probably doesn\u2019t have much experience with being a house pet. He's not really interested in toys or treats (unless we just haven't found his favorites yet!) and mostly just enjoys walking around the yard outside. Ramon has met other dogs here at the shelter and seems to get along well with them, but we'd recommend you bring your dog for a meet and greet to make sure. However, he does not like cats at all! Ramon also does not like being crated. He much prefers to have his freedom! Ramon is hoping to find a patient home who can teach him what it means to truly be a family member!

A two time offender of our local shelter, once heartworm positive (and treated) came back as a stray with a broken front leg. She has spent many months of rehab to heal and she is now ready to transition to her forever home.\n\nDonut is not fond of passing cars (we probably know why) and take a moment to warm up to people. She is a sweet girl that would make a great companion in your home. The outside world is a bit overwhelming for her so she would not do great in big social settings. She would like a fenced yard and some room to just be a dog.\n\nDonut is about 4 years old and medium size. She does well with other dogs (with proper intros) and is a vocal player. She loves to play tug of war. No Dog Parks for Donut. She is crate trained, house broken and very food motivated. No kids for her - too much excitement.\n\nShe just needs an understanding family that will give her the love she deserves and the time to settle in. (we prefer you own your own home as well)\n\nAvailable in Tampa, FL and surrounding counties ~ Adoption donation $250.00",

A perfect day for Guinness includes nice walks in the morning and evening, playtime (he loves to play tug of war very enthusiastically!) and cuddling on the couch with you while watching Netflix. He is house trained and only rarely pulls on his leash when he sees other dogs. Guinness is very patient and sweet with humans! He is crate trained as well. Guinness is a handsome boy who is sure to win your heart! \n\nGuinness' adoption is $150.00 and includes his neuter, microchip, 30-days pet health insurance, vaccinations, worming and a vet visit voucher.  Some of our dogs have also had heartworm tests, flea treatments, canine influenza vaccines, etc., but it is not standard procedure - please inquire about the specific animal you are interested in.  \n\nWe do adopt out-of-state, but require adopters to meet the pet prior to taking it home. The adopters also must have a plan for getting their new addition home before we process an application.  Please check out the airlines, PilotsNPaws, Operation Roger and CARE Transport in Denver for some transport options.\n\nWe are open Monday - Friday 11:00 am to 5 pm. You can also call us at 719-680-2385. To fill out the adoption application online please visit our website at noahsarktrinidad.org where you can then email the application with your inquiry. \n\nThank you for considering adoption through our shelter.",

He knows \"sit\", and the always popular \"treat\" and \"food\".\n\nHe is learning not to jump up when he meets new friends, he just gets so excited to meet new people!\n\nHe would be most comfortable in a forever home with low activity and lots of love.

He loves other dogs but he chases my cat and I have taught him no cat, but I would not want him in a home with cats as he would constantly chase them.  He loves kids and people but does take a moment to work up to some men occasionally (twice since i had him here).  Would be a great dog for anyone looking for a constant companion .  He loves to go for walks but needs some training on the leash.  He is so sweet and if you are on couch he will just lay his head on you and chil.  He has to be with someone or another animal constantly. He will go lay his head on the other dogs in the house or sit so close he is touching them.  He came from kill shelter and I rescued him being told he was a Rottie, I am not so sure what he is but pure love. \ntext me to meet him: 678-860-9983. I will require application vet reference and home visit!",

He gets along with non dominant dogs. He is very outgoing and loves to play. He also appeared to be good with kitties (he was a little scared of them lol!) He is good with older kids (has not been around little kids that we know of). He is a bigger boy, weighing close to 70 lbs. We do suggest crate training him for when you are gone as he may get mischievous.",

She is an approximately 10-12 month old spayed female, thought to be a Shepherd/Retreiver mix. Lady is quite friendly and loves people. She seems to get along fine with most other dogs, too. She survived an infection of parvovirus prior to coming to NCCR, and seems to be recovering very well. As with all young dogs, Lady will require ongoing daily training, exercise, lots of play time, and plenty of patience and love to help her become the best dog she can be!\n\nLady is spayed, vaccinated (including bordetella) and microchipped. Her adoption fee is $215.00. (cash or check only, we are unable to accept credit cards)\n\nLady is sponsored by Leanne DiNicola,  Julie Rabbit, Karen Larkin, Sandra Pavlock, Keith and Heidi Fowler, Joe and Kate Greulich in honor of Sam and Sarge, Kayme Crowell, David Grayson, Anne Odell, Bob and Trudy Sensel, Melford Swanson and Meg Thering in memory of Jen Leone's dog Chloe.\n\nIf you think you might be interested in adopting, your first step should be to complete an adoption application. APPLICATION to ADOPT: Copy and paste this link in your browser to view and complete the application https://forms.gle/NghtT4WTNiaZu7Cg9. You can also select the link, right click and choose open in a new window.\n\nWe do adopt out of state, however we do not transport or ship dogs.  Potential adopter must be able and willing to travel to the Rescue to meet the dog they are interested in.  \n\n*PLEASE double check all of the phone numbers that you provide as if they are incorrect, we will be unable to process your application.  Please also let your references know that someone from NCCR will be calling them. Most adoption team members call from their personal phone so advise your references that there may be an unknown number or a private number calling them.  \n\nNYS Registration #RR028.",

She would love to find a retired couple to live with or someone that works from home that she could be in their lap while they worked\n\nBindi is a super sweetie who loves to give and get lots of love! Bindi is house trained, can run up and down the stairs and jump up on the sofa. She can sleep in her crate, but prefers snuggling under the covers with her people. She does great with other dogs and is quick to learn the house routine! We should mention, Bindi does not have any teeth but that doesn't slow her down. She can eat crunchy things and soft stuff just fine! Do you have a lap that would be perfect for this sweet pup; if so please fill out an application!\n\nApplication available at https://www.pawsofloverescue.com/adoption-application. Adoption fee of $275 includes neuter/spay, microchip, heartworm testing, deworming, vaccinations, and other necessary procedures. Applications without a phone number will not be processed.\n\nApplications can be found online at www.pawsofloverescue.com, under the adopt tab. We require an approved application before a meet and greet is set up.\n2/2/21 5:51 PM",

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: 12/23/2020\nReason for being in rescue: Robyn was found as a stray\nFoster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SC\nSpecial Needs? Robyn was spayed on 1/7/21. She is up to date on all vaccines and heartworm negative. Robyn is ready for her forever home!\nWeight: 36 lbs\nHeight: 18 in\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $200\n\nFence needed? Yes\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Robyn is young, active, and learning to be a pet. She needs a patient, active family that will continue to work with her. Robyn needs basic training and continued work on crate training. Robyn is good with other dogs and will benefit from another active, well-mannered dog in the home to learn from. She will not be placed in a home with cats. No children under 10 for this girl; Robyn simply plays too rough.\n\nWhat is my personality like? Robyn came to us via the family of a team member. She didn't get along with the other dog in her home, and one of them had to go. While we are sad it was Robyn, we are happy to be a part of this girl's journey. Since joining our rescue family in December of 2020, Robyn has been learning the basics. She is working on crate training, leash training, and general basic commands. She has a lot of personality and is eager to learn and please.\n\nRobyn is a young dog with a big heart. She is not yet clean in her crate, but is really trying. Crates have clearly not been part of her life in the past and we know it takes time. Robyn loves people and gets very excited to see them. She will mouth and chew on arms to get attention, a behavior that we are working with her to improve. Robyn loves food and will eat anything you put in front of her.\n\nRobyn is selective about dogs. With our rescue staff under supervision she has done great with every dog she's been introduced to. She is happy and playful and eager to engage. In her home she did not get along with the other dog. Overall fit will be important.\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Friendly\n\nOther tips and tidbits: We have estimated Robyn's birthday at 12/23/2019. Robyn was found as a stray. This is purely an estimate based on her overall health and condition.\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

            "description": "Meet Milano!\nHave you ever met someone that makes your world brighter just by knowing them?? If not maybe you should meet me...my name is Milano and I am an amazing puppy with a big story. You see I had 3 siblings and when they were rescued I ran away and was not found till I was 6 months old...broken leg and skinny I had never known a humans love...well you would never know that's how I grew up because I am the happiest, most friendly puppy you will meet!! I am crate trained and house broken. In my foster home I live with kitties and other dogs and I love them all. My leg has healed and playing in my favorite thing to do. I LOVE toys and like to empty all the toy baskets. I bring them to bed, outside, on the couch wherever I can put them I surround myself with toys. I have tons of energy and love to run in the yard. I do worry if I can't see you outside so my foster mom is always outside with me so I never go looking for her where I am not supposed to. I am learning how to listen, sit and stay but my puppy energy gets the best of me sometimes. I am super smart and want to please you. I am so thankful to be in a warm home and would love to have my own forever family. My foster mom says I am one of those dogs you meet and never forget. I dive into your body to snuggle and sleep on my back in bed. And did I mention how handsome I am?? I'm ready and waiting for your application...can't wait to meet you.

He is a very happy dog who will become your shadow once he settles into your home. He is crate trained and potty trained. Hudson is still a bit timid as he is adjusting to life in a home environment. He is slowly learning that people are ok and pets do in fact feel good. He is dog friendly and would do best in a home with another play mate who can also show him the ropes with doing dog things. We are making progress walking on the leash also.\n\nHudson will be neutered, up to date on vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative! \n\nIf you are interested in adopting Hudson, fill out an application at https://www.eunoiarescue.org/adopt.",

            "description": "**WE ONLY DO HOME VISITS FOR ADOPTIONS NEAR BROWARD & PALM BEACH COUNTIES**\n\nCheck our New Years' baby, Rockwell ChiPoo (Chihuahua Poodle) He is lively and fun. He does take time to accept new people and will bark BUT baby talk works well to soothe him. He is 2 and a half years old and 10 pounds. He may not be totally hypoallergenic so if you have allergies to dogs, he won't be a match. Rockwell needs an adult home that will help him through his initial fear then he will give hugs to ask for attention. He comes around to love within an hour and he does NOT bite except at the vet when he is held down. Rockwell needs more work on socialization with new people. \n\nHe does bark, so if you are in a high-rise situation where you would be passing people all the time and you are not experienced with how to help him overcome his fears, then Rockwell is not for you. He thinks he is going to be hurt so this may take a while for him to get over his fear. He is loving and cuddly once he trusts you but every new person, Rockwell will go through this fear until he is properly desensitized. You will need to continue with nonaggressive training in order for him to have a peaceful life and not incidents of him getting into danger! He is always following you around and instantly rolls over for belly rubs! \n\nHe sleeps next to you as you with a subtle smile of appreciation. If you are looking for a little buddy, please check Rockwell! Rockwell's adoption fee is $350 to go towards his vetting (vaccines, spay/neuter, heartworm/Ehrlichia/Lyme test, fecal test, pre-op blood work, dental cleaning, and microchip as well as grooming if needed). If you are interested please fill out the adoption application For additional information regarding our adoption process, please check our FAQ's Page. \n\n *All dogs in the care of Get a Life Pet Rescue live in loving foster homes while waiting for their perfect match. They don't live in cages or crates (unless there is a medical reason to do so.) They are treated as family pets while in our care. * All dogs in our care are fed premium brand holistic food as well as supplements and vitamins specific to each dog's needs. \n\nWe don't buy inexpensive bulk dry kibble, our rescues are fed premium wet food diets as part of a comprehensive rehabilitation program to ensure maximum health.*All of our rescues receive complete quality vetting including full dental cleaning with pre-op bloodwork, spay/neuter, vaccines, and grooming. Dogs in need of specialized medicine will be seen by specialists, such as full cardiac workups, ophthalmologist visits, all suspicious lumps, and bumps are biopsied, and every medical need is transparent to potential adopters. *Once you adopt from Get a Life Pet Rescue, you become part of our compassionate family and we are here for you if a problem with your precious dog arises.\n\nContact 954-629-2445 or getalifepetrescue11@gmail.com",

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: 12/14/20\nReason for being in rescue: Ted was found as a stray. He was microchipped but sadly, the chip was never registered.\nFoster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SC\nSpecial Needs? Ted was neutered and had a dental on 12/29/20. He is up to date on all vaccines and heartworm negative.\nWeight: 22 lbs\nHeight: 14 in at the shoulder\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $399\n\nFence needed? Yes\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Ted is a young dog that needs positive reinforcement training. He is not for an inexperienced owner and will not be adopted to first time dog owners. Ted thinks he is alpha - over humans and other dogs. This results in behavior such as humping, refusal to follow basic commands, and snarling if pushed. Ted requires a very experienced owner, committed to positive reinforcement training. He requires a home that is active - Ted needs lots of physical and mental stimulation every day.\n\nTed's ideal home is as the only dog with an active family that has experience with rescue and a strong commitment to training. Ted will not be placed in a home with children. He will not be placed in a home with cats or other dogs.\n\nWhat is my personality like? If dogs could talk we can only imagine the stories that Ted would tell. A member of our community watched in their neighborhood as a car slowed down and a dog was let out. As the car pulled away, the dog remained. This dog was Ted, watching as his owners drove away. Thankfully the individual watching this happen scooped him up and got him to rescue. Ted was microchipped, but it was never registered. So after much effort and a stray hold, Ted is ready to start a new life!\n\nTed is a young dog with a big attitude. We have no history on his past, but Ted clearly ran the show. He can get snappy quickly if you stop him from doing something he is happy with or doesn't want to stop doing. He is a very smart dog who is savvy and accustomed to being the alpha. He humps to express his dominance - including other dogs and people. He loves food, but could care less about treats if he doesn't want to do something.\n\nTed is the type of dog that doesn't like to be put in a crate unless he goes in himself. He can be put on a leash but doesn't quite know how to walk on one just yet. He does have a lot of puppy energy and never wants to stay still. He has so much energy and life to share, but needs redirection and training to channel his energy in positive ways.\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Friendly\n\nOther tips and tidbits: We've estimated Ted's birthdate at 12/10/18. Ted was found as a stray so this is purely a guess based on his overall health and physical condition.\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

Now, I am looking for a family who is willing to engage in my playful activities.  I am good with children and just a loveable boy. Oh, one more thing, I have never met a cat, so I do not know much about them. \n\nLooking for a fun new life\u2026 Yours truly, Thor\n\nPlease email info@greatpyratlanta.com",

Well, I still have to learn how not to be possessive of my food bowl or territorial with my house and the things I want to protect. With more training, I want to overcome these issues. What else can I share\u2026well, I am a four-year-old female that will fit best with an experienced Great Pyrenees owner or family who does not have other dogs or cats. A backyard is also recommended for me for exercise until I learn better leash manners and do not feel that I have to overprotect those walking me. I almost forgot to share with you that I am great with children and can be touched anywhere as I love my humans. Yes, I have some learning to do, but GPRA tells me that I can still be the best Pyr for a family with professional training, consistency, and patience.\n\nThank you for reading my story. \u2013 Millie Joy\n\nPlease email info@greatpyratlanta.com.",

Gus is a low rider with stubby legs and a charming personality! He has a Chi-atude and thinks he is Large and In Charge! Gus is friendly and loves to meet new people! He likes car rides and long walks. He is house trained and signals when he needs to go out loves to play sticks to you like glue, happy, and kissy. He is a goofy guy and will steal your heart.

She is working on sharing her foster parents with the other dogs. She just gives a low growl, so this is a minor training issue she'll learn. 6-year-old Dana is 13 pounds, healthy, and ready for her devoted home. Dana walks well on the leash and would benefit from some good outings to keep her socialized and happy. Dana's adoption fee is $350 to go towards her vetting (vaccines, spay/neuter, heartworm/Ehrlichia/Lyme test, fecal test, pre-op blood work, dental cleaning, and microchip as well as grooming if needed). If you are interested please fill out the adoption application For additional information regarding our adoption process, please check our FAQ's Page. \n\n *All dogs in the care of Get a Life Pet Rescue live in loving foster homes while waiting for their perfect match. They don't live in cages or crates (unless there is a medical reason to do so.) They are treated as family pets while in our care. * All dogs in our care are fed premium brand holistic food as well as supplements and vitamins specific to each dog's needs. \n\nWe don't buy inexpensive bulk dry kibble, our rescues are fed premium wet food diets as part of a comprehensive rehabilitation program to ensure maximum health.*All of our rescues receive complete quality vetting including full dental cleaning with pre-op bloodwork, spay/neuter, vaccines, and grooming. Dogs in need of specialized medicine will be seen by specialists, such as full cardiac workups, ophthalmologist visits, all suspicious lumps, and bumps are biopsied, and every medical need is transparent to potential adopters. \n\n*Once you adopt from Get a Life Pet Rescue, you become part of our compassionate family and we are here for you if a problem with your precious dog arises.",

            "description": "Is Pluto a planet or an asteroid? Neither, it\u2019s me, a six-pound, eight-year-old male chihuahua! I\u2019m fully vetted, vaccinated, neutered, microchipped, and on heartworm preventative, ready and waiting to make your life utterly heavenly!\n\nI make up for my small size with a whole lot of love! I am always down for snuggles and prefer to sleep on top of my humans for maximum warmth and comfort. I\u2019m also happy to cuddle with other dogs. I\u2019m a joyful, energetic pup, and I\u2019d love to join you for a stroll around the neighborhood. One thing is certain--when you\u2019re around, I\u2019ll always be in orbit!\n\nI picked up a bad habit or two in my life before coming to the rescue, but I\u2019m working hard to overcome them! I like having a place in the house to mark, so I'd like a potty pad I can use. Frequent trips outside help too! My vet also said I have a heart murmur, but it doesn't bother me a bit! I require daily medication for pain management and will need an experienced owner who will handle me gently. Because of this, I need to be in a home with no small children.\n\nDespite the challenges I\u2019ve had in life, I\u2019m a loving and happy--not to mention handsome--little guy. I can\u2019t wait to find my forever family and share all my affection and joy. Are you ready to meet me? Trust me, the experience will be out of this world!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Pluto, please DO NOT SEND A MESSAGE TO OUR RESCUE GROUP.  We are too busy placing dogs in great homes to answer messages and inquiries through the listing site.  \n\nPLEASE GO TO THE LINK BELOW TO COMPLETE AN ADOPTION APPLICATION.\n \nwww.chihuahua-rescue.com/adoption-application\n \nCRT requires an approved adoption application and a home visit for all adoption applicants.  CRT transports to OH, KY, IL, MI, MN, WI. \n\n",

This happy little fella is going to bring lots of joy to some lucky adopters, so don't delay, get your application in to your coordinator Cameron S. at\n\nhttps://tinyurl.com/MAMAS-Cameron \n\nor\n\nhttps://mamasshelter.rescuegroups.org/forms/form?formid=5828 \n\nYou may email Ginger's adoption coordinator Cameron directly at CameronS.SafeHaven@GMAIL.COM   for specific questions or inquires. If she is listed as active, she IS still available for adoption. She will be removed as soon as she has a pending adopter. Please also keep in mind, the demand for puppies is very high right now and we receive large numbers of inquiries and applications, so it is very difficult to respond to everyone, but we certainly do our best. Thank you and I look forward to working with you very soon.",

He needs some leash training as he pulls way too hard on the leash. Enzo was tested with food for aggression and passed! He was also tested with cats and female dogs and passed. He will need a home without male dogs. He is available for adoption so hurry in to meet him!! \n\nEnzo is located at the Richland County Dog Shelter in Mansfield, OH\n\nPhone is 419-774-5892\nIt is an application process.

We list breed mixes that they most resemble or that their former owners said they were.  However, we don't make any guarantees about breed - it is a best guess!\nTo meet one of our adoptable pets or to start the adoption process, please access the adoption application on our website, www.crossroadsanimalrescue.org or download and email it to crossroadsanimalrescuesc@gmail.com. We will then approve you (sending in the application does not obligate you to adopt) and we can set up a time for you to meet one or more of our pets. You can then pay the adoption fee and officially adopt after meeting your new family member. Alternatively, you can do the adoption over the phone before meeting your new pet. The benefit to this is that we will hold the pet for you. However, the adoption fee is non-refundable if you changed your mind after adopting over the phone.\n\nOur adoption fees include the spay/neuter surgery, deworming, vet exam, and up to date vaccines. It also includes microchipping as well as heartworm testing or feline leukemia testing. We are happy to adopt out-of-state (and even out of the country!) but transportation for the adopted pet is the responsibility of the new pet owner.\n\nIf you cannot adopt a pet at this time but would like to support our rescue, please click on the \"Sponsor a Pet\" button. Your donation will help feed the dogs, cats, small animals, and horses at CARE.\nPlease email at crossroadsanimalrescuesc@gmail.com or call us at (864)972-9906 for more information. This phone number will reach Crossroads Animal Hospital, which is the home of CARE. During business hours, a receptionist will be able to speak with you regarding our adoptable pets. After business hours, the only way to contact CARE is via email. Our puppies and kittens are also eligible for 10% off the rest of the vaccines in their puppy/kitten vaccination series at Crossroads Animal Hospital. Most adult pets are spayed/neutered prior to adoption. Puppies and kittens may have the surgery before adoption or we may have new owners return later for the surgery. For more information about CARE and to see our adoption application, go to our website, www.crossroadsanimalrescue.org",

If there are multiple applications for a puppy, after all home checks are done, then the puppy is adopted out to the home that is the best fit for that puppy.\n***** All breeds listed are a best guess or based on information from our rescue partners and are not guaranteed*****\n \n ******Chicagoland Dog Rescue reserves the right to restrict adoption of a dog to potential adopters who live within a fifty (50) mile radius of Schaumburg, IL *****\n\nHello out there!  My name is Corky and I am a bundle of puppy energy and just love to run around the yard with the other dogs in my foster home. I am doing really well with potty training and will go by the door when I need to go outside. I do sleep thru the night in my crate and when I need to go in the crate while my foster parents are at something called work? Not sure what that is but they come back and let me run around! I will whine and bark for a few minutes but then I get quiet and just relax. I am very friendly with people and other dogs in the foster home and just love EVERYTHING!  I\u2019m such a happy boy. And,  my foster family says I am just adorable!  I am doing very well walking on a leash. I am not very good with cats as I like to chase them every once in a while. Because I am so people and dog friendly, I would be the perfect addition to just about any home! Like all puppies, I am looking for a lot of love, patience, and time for training so I can be AMAZING!  If you would like to meet me, please fill out a pre-adoption application and a CDR volunteer will get back to you just as quick as they can!\n XOXO\n Corky\n\n\n\n**The ADOPTION FEE for this pet is $450 which includes getting the puppy/dog up to date on rabies, distemper and bordetella vaccines, fecal test and deworming if necessary, heartworm test, spay or neuter (not including pre-surgical bloodwork) and a microchip. Free access to our weekly training classes is also included for the life of the dog, something no other rescue in the area offers.***",

We will then approve you (sending in the application does not obligate you to adopt) and we can set up a time for you to meet one or more of our pets. You can then pay the adoption fee and officially adopt after meeting your new family member. Alternatively, you can do the adoption over the phone before meeting your new pet. The benefit to this is that we will hold the pet for you. However, the adoption fee is non-refundable if you changed your mind after adopting over the phone.\n\nOur adoption fees include the spay/neuter surgery, deworming, vet exam, and up to date vaccines. It also includes microchipping as well as heartworm testing or feline leukemia testing. We are happy to adopt out-of-state (and even out of the country!) but transportation for the adopted pet is the responsibility of the new pet owner.\n\nIf you cannot adopt a pet at this time but would like to support our rescue, please click on the \"Sponsor a Pet\" button. Your donation will help feed the dogs, cats, small animals, and horses at CARE.\nPlease email at crossroadsanimalrescuesc@gmail.com or call us at (864)972-9906 for more information.

Our puppies and kittens are also eligible for 10% off the rest of the vaccines in their puppy/kitten vaccination series at Crossroads Animal Hospital.

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: 12/19/2020\nReason for being in rescue: Stray Anderson\nFoster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SC\nSpecial Needs? Jakob was neutered on 12/29/20. He is current on vaccines and heartworm negative. Jakob is currently being treated for ear mites. These are contaigous!\nWeight: 56 lbs\nHeight: 24 in\nSpayed/Neutered: No\n\nAdoption Fee: $200\n\nFence needed? Yes\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Jakob is young and active with absolutely no manners. This cutie needs a very active home that is committed to training and lots of physical and mental stimulation. Jakob is a lot of dog. His energy is too much for most dogs. He could live with another dog, but it would take just the right pet. Jakob would be very happy as the only dog in your home. Jakob is not suited for a home with children under 10. He is not suited for a home with cats. JAKOB DOES SHED!\n\nWhat is my personality like? Jakob is a big silly goof ball, he loves to prance around and hang his tongue out and is quite clumsy!!! He's a big puppy with little understanding of manners. He is not dog aggressive but can startle dogs if they do not match his energy, which can lead to a fight if not monitored properly. He would do well with another large rambunctious dog to show him the ropes. Jakob is a chewer, if it fits in his mouth he will chew it. He's a lot of puppy. He adores pets and cuddles. !!!!!HIGH SHEDDING!!!!!!\n\nJacob will \"fence fight\" with other dogs. We think it is less about fighting and more about wanting to get to the action and wanting to play. Jacob needs a very active home preferably with no children under 10. He likes to hug.\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Friendly\n\nOther tips and tidbits: Jakob's estimated birthday is 12/11/2019\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

Willow can't wait to meet her forever family!\n\nMost of our pets are obtained from animal control and therefore we are not certain of their breed or breed mix.  We list breed mixes that they most resemble or that their former owners said they were.  However, we don't make any guarantees about breed - it is a best guess!\nTo meet one of our adoptable pets or to start the adoption process, please access the adoption application on our website, www.crossroadsanimalrescue.org or download and email it to crossroadsanimalrescuesc@gmail.com. We will then approve you (sending in the application does not obligate you to adopt) and we can set up a time for you to meet one or more of our pets. You can then pay the adoption fee and officially adopt after meeting your new family member. Alternatively, you can do the adoption over the phone before meeting your new pet. The benefit to this is that we will hold the pet for you. However, the adoption fee is non-refundable if you changed your mind after adopting over the phone.\n\nOur adoption fees include the spay/neuter surgery, deworming, vet exam, and up to date vaccines. It also includes microchipping as well as heartworm testing or feline leukemia testing. We are happy to adopt out-of-state (and even out of the country!) but transportation for the adopted pet is the responsibility of the new pet owner.\n\nIf you cannot adopt a pet at this time but would like to support our rescue, please click on the \"Sponsor a Pet\" button. Your donation will help feed the dogs, cats, small animals, and horses at CARE.\nPlease email at crossroadsanimalrescuesc@gmail.com or call us at (864)972-9906 for more information. This phone number will reach Crossroads Animal Hospital, which is the home of CARE. During business hours, a receptionist will be able to speak with you regarding our adoptable pets. After business hours, the only way to contact CARE is via email. Our puppies and kittens are also eligible for 10% off the rest of the vaccines in their puppy/kitten vaccination series at Crossroads Animal Hospital. Most adult pets are spayed/neutered prior to adoption. Puppies and kittens may have the surgery before adoption or we may have new owners return later for the surgery. For more information about CARE and to see our adoption application, go to our website, www.crossroadsanimalrescue.org",

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: 11/19/2020\nReason for being in rescue: Laurens Co AC seized\nFoster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SC\nSpecial Needs? Evie was spayed on 12/10/20. She is up to date on vaccines and heartworm negative. She's ready for her forever home!\nWeight: 30 lb\nHeight: 18 in\nSpayed/Neutered: No\n\nAdoption Fee: $200\n\nFence needed? No, but she would love one. EVIE CAN NEVER BE LEFT OUTSIDE ALONE - SHE WILL JUMP OR CLIMB ANY FENCE IF UNSUPERVISED.\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Evie is a young dog looking for an active life. She needs a patient owner that will give her time to warm up. Once she trusts you, Evie will be your go-everywhere adventure buddy. Evie would benefit from another confident dog in the home that she can learn from. Evie can NEVER be left outside in a yard alone. She will climb or jump any fence to get to his people!\n\nWhat is my personality like? Evie arrived in rescue as part of a drug bust with many siblings. We don't know what life had been like for these dogs. In general they are all younger, all timid, but all very, very sweet once they trust you.\n\nEvie is a dog that is unsure about the world around her. She clearly hasn't had a ton of life experiences or much exposure. But underneath that timid shell is a girl that is quick to trust. Evie gets very attached to her humans very quickly. So much so, that she will scale and jump any fence to get near you.\n\nIt is not a surprise to us that Evie is great with other dogs - she has always lived as part of a pack. Dagmar is a gentle dog. She is squeaky clean in his crate, very rarely barks, and has shown no aggressive behaviors toward other dogs or people since arriving in rescue. She knows absolutely nothing about leashes, but is curious to learn.\n\nWhen introduced to our office cats, Evie simply ignored them. They do not run away and are pretty blase about meeting dogs. Evie is going to make someone a great sidekick!\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Shy but curious and friendly\n\nOther tips and tidbits: Evie's estimated birthday is 11/13/2019\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

Her story started in a very sad way with Leila found herself in a high kill shelter in the city of Pinsk (Belarus).  This shelter is one of the most cruel and inhumane places on the territory of the former USSR.  Leila was taken from the shelter by a volunteer and she flew to Moscow where other volunteers found a foster home for her.  Now Leila is a healthy and energetic beautiful puppy, up to date on all vaccines and preventives. She is a very affectionate pup, human-oriented, her favorite thing is to play with her toys and relax on a couch. Leila is curious like all puppies, loves to explore new places and ride a car. She is good on a leash, potty trained and listens to the commands.  She is good with other dogs, cats and kids. Leila is looking preferably for the one-owner dog, a woman, who is ready to give her a lot of love, care and attention and she'll pay back!\n\nIf you feel like she is the girl for you, fill out our adoption applications for her: https://forms.gle/AESXFn9Cg2gekfHUA",

Stu came into rescue after being dumped in a box on a rural road- covered in sarcoptic mange, and extremely malnourished and now he is a gorgeous puppy ready for adoption! Stu is house trained and is a very sweet boy that plays well with others and shares his toys nicely!

If it is posted, it is available. However, we may be working other applications that came in before yours. If so, by the time you are approved, the puppy may not be available.\n\nAdoption Fee: $425\n\nAll of our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, heartworm tested and up to date on vaccinations.\n\nTransport Fee: $300\n\nTransport fee includes the cost of transport plus the Health Certificate required for USDA approved transport.\n\nAll of our dogs are spayed/neutered and up to date on vaccinations.\n\nAdoption applications can be found on our website: www.greatpyrsandpaws.org\n\nhttps://greatpyrsandpaws.rescuegroups.org/forms/form?formid=5959\n\nNorthwest adopter pays cost of transport to independent transport company.

            "description": "Meet this sweet boy named Milo James! He came into the shelter January 11, 2021 when the owner could no longer keep him. He is  unsure of shelter life ( very common with all new people, smells, other animals, & nothing familiar). We believe he was on a chain or some form of a tie out most of the time because of the calloused areas on the top of his neck and underneath his neck. We are not sure if hair will grow back but we\u2019re going to try to help him. He is super sweet and loves being loved on and helping him feel secure. He is around 2 and a half years old, current on shots, and neutered.  He came in with 2 cats who we were told he got along well with. Also owner did say he seems to like more female dogs but doesn\u2019t really care for make dogs. He\u2019s such a sweet boy and I truly feel his sweetness will shine through brighter and bright once he settles in more and will even more once in a loving home where he feels safe and loved. Might you have the most amazing loving FOREVER home for sweet Milo James?! Visit with him today! \nIf you have another dog and are interested in meeting another potential new furry member please bring him or her to the shelter and meet on neutral ground before adopting. No need to shuffle the animals around any more than necessary. Please know that 1 mosquito bite can create heart worms and they can be fatal if not treated. It is VERY important to keep your pets healthy and protected by keeping them on a once a month heart worm and flea/tick prevention. These animals are counting on you as their owner to provide them with lots a love and the proper health care so PLEASE make sure you are aware and prepared before adopting. Owning a pet is an extra expense and responsibility but is so worth every minute and penny you invest in them. They will add lots of joy and unconditional love if given a fair chance.\nThe shelter is open Mon.-Fri. 10-1, 2-5, Sat. 10-4.  Adopt a homeless pet and save a life. If you can not adopt right now come out and volunteer and make a difference in the lives of these animals while they await their FOREVER home.  \nIn order to adopt any of our \"bully breeds\" there is special paper work that will need to be collected and approved prior to the adoption.  We love all of our dogs and want to make sure to place our \"bully babies\" in homes best suited for them.",

We were told he is good with cats and other dogs and the owner's son, but he is very shy and leery of new people, especially men.  We were told that at one time a man had been very mean to him, thus the lack of trust.  Once he gains your trust, he's a different dog!  He does fine on car rides and absolutely adores our shelter worker!  With everyone else, it is very slow going - you MUST gain his trust and do it on his time!  He has a very large growl, but has never once tried to bite - even at the vet.  Tucker isn't available quite yet, but we wanted to get him posted for people to see his big beautiful face!  He is on some meds right now because of his allergies - his ears and skin need some TLC - and we're giving him medicated baths once a week for a few weeks, we'll see how that goes:)  It will take the right person for this big fella, but he will be a great addition and a real love!",

            "description": "Meet this sweetheart named Faith!  She was surrendered over to an animal control officer out in the field with the owners no longer wanted her. She has lived her life since a puppy on a chain and came in with a few sores on her head and coat of fur not in great condition. That will all change now and her future is bright. Though she does need a special home because she is deaf. Can\u2019t imagine being alone on a chain, deaf, & so young being confined to fend yourself from the scary world out there but she did! She has played with another pup at the shelter and had fun we just have to use caution because she can\u2019t hear warning signs if a dog is not enjoying playing or their time together. A patient home that can work with her on the basics would be great because she has spent her life outside and confines. Faith likes to chase cats so she needs a home without any cats. Faith is 1 year old, now current on shots, and so ready to begin her life with a true loving person or family who will promise to give her a loving life she deserves. She\u2019s as beautiful as she is sweet and hopes to find her happily ever after very soon! Stop by for a visit with Faith today! \nIf you have another dog and are interested in meeting another potential new furry member please bring him or her to the shelter and meet on neutral ground before adopting. No need to shuffle the animals around any more than necessary. Please know that 1 mosquito bite can create heart worms and they can be fatal if not treated. It is VERY important to keep your pets healthy and protected by keeping them on a once a month heart worm and flea/tick prevention. These animals are counting on you as their owner to provide them with lots a love and the proper health care so PLEASE make sure you are aware and prepared before adopting. Owning a pet is an extra expense and responsibility but is so worth every minute and penny you invest in them. They will add lots of joy and unconditional love if given a fair chance.\nThe shelter is open Mon.-Fri. 10-1, 2-5, Sat. 10-4.  Adopt a homeless pet and save a life. If you can not adopt right now come out and volunteer and make a difference in the lives of these animals while they await their FOREVER home.  \nIn order to adopt any of our \"bully breeds\" there is special paper work that will need to be collected and approved prior to the adoption.  We love all of our dogs and want to make sure to place our \"bully babies\" in homes best suited for them.",

He's been getting the royal treatment here at the shelter with special baths, medicine, and food to help him feel much better! Buddy even caught someone's eye and they have donated $100 towards his medical care! This old guy really just wants some routine in his life so he can settle down. He has attended our playgroups but wants no part of rowdy play. He would prefer a calm canine companion if he were to be in a multidog home--no young whippersnappers! Do you have a cozy cough for this guy to curl up on?",

Guessing his age around 3 years old, Bowie was a stray brought to us so we only know what we've learned about him since he has been with us. He is very sweet, minds very well, has that great beagle nose and really quiet for the breed\nWe require that you have a fenced in yard, not a \"kennel\" in the yard AND we do not approve underground fencing. Depending upon the dog some exceptions are made for those who live in apartments. We also require that the adoptee will be a part of the family \"living\" within the home. Our adoption process may be found on our website at www.bitofheaven.org\n\nVisits are scheduled by appointment only via emailing request to ownedbycaninesandlovit@yahoo.com",

He came to FDHS as a stray after a nice lady let him crash on her couch for a few days before bringing him to us. Bowie seems VERY friendly with everyone, however, he does need work on his manners! He tends to jump on and kiss everyone he comes into contact with, however he isn't too shabby about keeping his kennel nice and tidy. We don't know for certain how he does with other dogs (although we aren't terribly concerned given his sweet nature) so a meet and greet is a must! We also aren't sure how he would do or if he has ever been around kitties. We are guessing him to be right around a year old and is the perfect age to start getting acclimated to a forever family!\nBowie is scheduled to be neutered and heartworm tested, he is vaccinated and and up-to-date on prevention!",

No one came looking for me, so here I am, trying to find my furever home. I am good with other dogs, but not a fan of kitties. I am recommended to go home with older children, due to my high play drive and I can be sorta rough sometimes. I don't mean to be, I just don't know any better. If you think I'm cute and you'd like to come and meet me, please come in and ask a Kennel Staff Member to arrange a meet and greet for us. \n\nLove,\nBoston",

Unfortunately, those horrible Wisconsin people dumped me and I was found wandering in the cold, emaciated. So here I am again! Door County has been so much fun but it is time for me to go onto my final chapter. My foster momma got me back to happy and healthy! I am spunky, silly, and extremely playful. If you have another dog I insist on it being one who loves to wrestle and be goofy. I love kids but since I'm so silly kids older than 10 would be best for me so I don't knock them down on accident. I am an expert at snuggling and love naps next to my humans. I don't have any problems with you messing with me while I eat. I know to sit for treats and am extremely good with going potty outside. I don't necessarily have a sign when I have to go out but I start pacing extremely fast trying to tell you to let me out. I know 'kennel' like a pro but I do expect a treat after I go in it. If you are interested in a cool dude like me go to sandipaws.org to fill out an application.\nThank you for your interest in a Sandi Paws Rescue, Inc. Please visit our site at sandipaws.org for more information on our organization or to fill out an application to adopt one of our pets. You can find information for volunteering o. our site as well.",

I love other dogs and play boxing with them and running! My foster brother is a black lab and love playing with him! I do okay in the car but get anxious about where we are going. As for being house trained, my foster parents are working with me. I have had a few accidents, but I am learning to go to the back door when I need to go outside. My foster brother is helping me too! I enjoy sleeping on the couch relaxing while my foster parents watch tv. I do sleep in my kennel at night and if my foster parents are not home. I dont mind it, but I like someone close by at night or I will whine and bark. I hope one day to be with my forever home that will love me the way my foster parents love me!!! PICK ME MACY! If you want to adopt me, submit an application at www.southcharlottedogrescue.com",

She is very timid, especially with new people. She is also a very picky eater and is eating chicken breast mixed in with canned and dry dog food. Chances are, she was fed exclusively \"\"people food\"\" wherever she came from. Once she bonds with you, she is very sweet and gentle but still runs from you. For that reason, we feel a fenced in yard would be safer. Tinsel was attacked by a large dog so she is uncertain around other animals and would be best as an only-dog.We also found a small bullet still lodged in her upper hind leg so this girl has been through a lot of abuse and is looking for a special home who will be patient. She does love small children so we are ideally looking for a family with a well behaved child for Tinsel to love!\nWe appreciate your support in helping us to find homes for our local rescues! This is how we can help lower the euthanasia rate in our county shelter. PAWS Humane Society is a local volunteer group that has helped with over 1,400 spays/neuters for the community each year through our community assistance program. We have also adopted over 600 animals during 2018. Our adoption fees include the cost of spaying/neutering, vaccinations (including rabies for cats over 4 months of age), flea prevention, worming, FeLV/FIV testing and microchipping. All PAWS Humane Society cats/kittens have been home-fostered so that you can be assured of a pet's good temperament before adopting from us. The location of our Adoption Centers: at PETCO at 6305 E. State St. in Rockford, Illinois - Forest Plaza. and PAWS at 7282 N. Cherryvale Mall Drive . Check out all of our adoptable cats and kittens on our website at www.pawshs.org. You can also contact us on our hotline: 815/299-PAWS.",

            "description": "Here is Hannah Banana! This cutie-patootie is around 35 lbs. She loves to play in the fenced in yard with her canine foster brother. She enjoys the company of dogs, people of all ages, and cats. She will need an active family because she has an enormous amount of energy! She loves walks and someone throwing a ball for her - she does not always bring it back but has tons of fun, regardless!\n\nShe is an amazing dog that did not get the best start in life, as indicated by the chain marks around her neck. Her foster family guesses she has never been indoors but is acclimating well. She is eager to please and is very food driven. The best family for her would probably have older kids because during play she jumps and may unintentionally hurt younger children. She loves attention! While playing she does growl and bark at you but her tail is going a million miles a minute, letting you know she is just a vocal girl, encouraging play. When you are trying to correct her behavior she smiles at you...teeth and all, it's actually very cute and makes it harder to be upset with her. She is house trained.\n_________________________________________________________________________\nAdoption Donation for Hannah is $ 425.00\n\nWANT TO MEET Hannah\n\nThe first step would be for you to go to our website at www.aear.org and then to the \"\"Adopting a Pet\"\" page to read about our Adoption Process which will answer many of your questions and then to fill out an Adoption Application.\n\nAlso, please visit our very active Facebook Page for updates on Hannah and our other adoptable pets with AEAR - www.facebook.com/aear.org",

            "description": "Sage weighs about 50-60 pounds and is a very people friendly dog. She is definitely housebroken and has done well with the teenaged kids in her foster house. She is even friendly when meeting strangers. She is a lover and a people pleaser for sure! \nSage does well with the other dogs in her foster house (currently she lives with an 80 lb shepherd and 15 lb chihuahua mix). The pups had a few scuffles over food between them, but no other aggression. She can be a little snappy with food but is otherwise a sweetheart. \n\nSage has shown some interest in one of the cats, but doesn't chase or bark at it, even when the other dogs go crazy over the cats!\n\nShe goes to vet for her spay on January 26th, and then she will be ready for her forever home!\n_________________________________________________________________________\nAdoption Donation for Sage is $ 425.00\n\nWANT TO MEET Sage\n\nThe first step would be for you to go to our website at www.aear.org and then to the \"\"Adopting a Pet\"\" page to read about our Adoption Process which will answer many of your questions and then to fill out an Adoption Application.\n\nAlso, please visit our very active Facebook Page for updates on Sage and our other adoptable pets with AEAR - www.facebook.com/aear.org",

I am \napproximately 6 months old and 25 pounds so I am full of puppy playfulness and spunk! \nI started out in Texas, rode for a very long time in a bus, and found myself in this awesome place called DCHS where they are helping me search for a place to call home! This home will ideally have time to play with me, take me on walks/exploring, and teach me cool tricks. My future parents must also understand that it is very important for me to get annual dental cleanings and x-rays to monitor my oral health due to likely having a fever as a young pup so my teeth didn't form correctly.

            "description": "Meet Axle!! Axle is a goofy big man who just wants a fun home to call his own. Axle may be 5 years old, but he still plays like a puppy! He also loves to wiggle around and scratch his back on the couch. Axle likes his bones and food a little too much which has resulted in minor resource guarding and food aggression. With this being said, he gives plenty of warning when he feels like his bone/food is being threatened so as long as his future owners feed him in a separate location, he will do just fine. Due to his resource guarding, he will not be able to go to a home with young children (over 12 would be best). Axle does not like other dogs so he cannot go to a home with other dogs. He is house trained and crate trained. Axle is also neutered and UTD on all of his vaccines.If you are interested in learning more about this pet, call the Montgomery County, Virginia, Animal Care and Adoption Center at 540-382-5795.",

I am a work in progress as I am extremely scared and untrusting. The puppy play groups at HALO are helping me tremendously and we feel it is time to look for my family. I have never bitten, but I do give the warning look if you go too fast. Looking for a calm, assertive adult only family to continue, with HALO's help to work on building me up so that I can have an amazing, trusting world. PS... I have the best ears!All of our dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, up to date with age appropriate vaccinations, heart worm or feleuk/FIV tested, fecal tested, rabies and tag, and microchipped before being placed in your home.

I can NOT go to a home in a city or county with pitbull restrictions!\n\nMy name is Murphy and my foster mom has awarded me the most improved puppy trophy. You see, my litter mates and I had a very rough start. As a result, I have had to learn some manners in order to be a good doggie citizen. My behavior has improved hugely with training and lots of love. It will be very important for me to find a forever home that can continue this training. \n\nI am a lab mix, who likely has some pittie in him. I am fine around cats, small dogs, and big dogs. I adore young kids and have even bonded well with special needs kids. I get a little worried around men, but have warmed up to my foster dad and I enjoy getting snuggles from him. I thrive with boundaries, training, and time. \n\nDue to my difficult start in life, I have suffered from malnutrition. This has affected my legs and caused them to bow. I take special vitamins for this and need to be extra careful on slippery surfaces. With vitamins, nutrition, softer surfaces, and play to help my bones get stronger, I should make a good recovery.",

She is eager to learn and please. Sailor loves to snuggle on the couch right up next to her person and is very loving and affectionate. She enjoys her crate after she is settled in. When at home Sailor prefers humans over other dogs, so she would like to be your one and only. She is learning the word sit and wants to learn some new words as well. Sailor tends to stop a lot on walks, but with a little motivation, she will go on three to four walks a day. This friendly pup is good on her leash and is unlikely to pull when she sees another dog. Sailor came to the rescue very skinny, and she is now so focused on food and that she will need training around counter surfing in the kitchen. Apply today to bring this ray of sunshine into your life.\n\n__________________________________\n\nIf you are interested in meeting a dog or cat, we require an adoption application.

Thora is still learning the appropriate way to show affection; for this reason she is probably not a good match for young children until she receives more training.\nHouse Training Progress: Working on it her anxiety about city sounds is making it hard for her to go to the bathroom outside.\nCrate Training Progress: Sleeps and eats in her crate\nLocation: DC area foster\nRescued From: Bladen County, NC\nAdditional Information: Miss Thora is a sweet southern belle who is warm and cuddly. She will also run and play for hours when she feels comfortable. She has been working hard to get used to city sounds but still finds them quite scary, so she would do best with an adopter who lives in a quiet suburban area. When she is out in the open running through a big fenced yard or on a hike, Thora is very much in her element and will run and play all day - especially tug of war or fetch! If a guest comes over, Thora will greet them kindly with a few kisses and ask for a belly rub or two in return. If you have treats, shell gladly show off her sit and touch skills for you. Thora makes herself right at home wherever she is, finding the perfect comfy spot on the couch or an overstuffed chair, resting her head on a pillow, and looking at you for pets. She loves getting bear hugs from her people, and in return will try to convince them she is actually a lap dog.\n\nThora is sponsored and named by Samantha F in memory of her family's beloved Thunder. \n\n__________________________________\n\nIf you are interested in meeting a dog or cat, we require an adoption application.

He enjoys sleeping through the day but has spurts of energy and has lots of fun entertaining himself with toys! (Gabe is also hard at work learning the difference between pillows and dog toys.) He wants to be your best friend and will be a great lifelong partner. Apply today to meet this joyous pup!\n\n__________________________________\n\nIf you are interested in meeting a dog or cat, we require an adoption application. If the animal has \"HAS APPLICATION\" listed, they are still available to receive additional applications but also may be in the process of being adopted soon. Apply for a DOG: http://www.citydogsrescuedc.org/adoptable-dogs.html\n\nInterested in saving more lives? Foster a dog today! Learn more, see our list of dogs needing foster, and apply, https://www.citydogsrescuedc.org/foster-a-city-dog.html\n\nCity Dogs Rescue & City Kitties is a foster-based rescue in Washington, DC. We do not have a shelter. We focus on local adoptions in DC and the metro area of Maryland and Virginia. CDR&CK has a thorough adoption process in order to find the best possible fit for each of our dogs and cats (we do not operate under a first-come, first-served model).\n\nUpon accepting a new cat or dog into the organization, we provide a basic vet visit that includes necessary vaccinations, disease screenings, deworming, microchips, and spay/neuter (unless specified). We do not provide a comprehensive medical exam prior to adoption. As a result, sickness, injury, and disability may exist unbeknownst to CDR&CK. City Dogs Rescue & City Kitties is not responsible for payment of any vet care, including known and unknown medical conditions once a cat or dog is adopted from us. \nDog specific: Rabies, DHPP, Bordatella vaccines. They are tested for HW, Lyme, Ehrlichia, Anaplasmosis.\n\nMost cats and dogs will have a house training accident in the initial days in their new home and we cannot guarantee any pet is housebroken or crate trained.\n\nWe also update our Facebook page daily with new cats and dogs.",

I'm very timid at first, and sometimes I can come off a little mean, but once I warm up, I'm yours forever. I would do best in a home with no other dogs or kids, as I want the attention for myself. I need a yard to run and play fetch, and I also love to go on 'sniffy walks, you know, for the 'brain stimulation. I am the sweetest dog and deserve to live out the rest of my life with humans who love me unconditionally and will be patient with some of my quirks.",

            "description": "This is Chip!\n\n10-year-old Chip and his brother Stewie became Frosted Faces on January 12th through our Final Wish program. Their devoted pet sitter reached out to us after their owner passed away, and no one in the extended family could take them. Chip and Stewie are very friendly and sweet boys!\n\nChip and Stewie have gone on several hiking dates with our volunteers and have earned rave reviews for being VERY good boys! One shared, \"I can't say enough good things about these two little gentlemen! They are excellent car dogs! Not a peep! Laid down, looked out the window, jumped in and out easily. We walked 2 1/2 miles and they could have gone more, especially Chip. He's part Energizer bunny! Stewie kept up, though! And just when I thought he was worn out, he came back to FFF and played fetch! They have table manners! We stopped for Wendy's before going back to FFF and got them each a plain burger. They waited patiently, never nipped, never tried to grab our own food, never once crowded us while we ate. Stewie loves cuddles and hugs, but on a walk, Chip is all business. Wanna pet him? Fine, but he doesn't care much one way or the other lol. They are clearly a well-mannered, sweet as pie, bonded pair of brothers. Any family would be lucky to have them!!\"\n\nStop by our next Open House and meet these well-behaved and fun boys!\n\nVisit us at Open House: Saturdays & Sundays, 10 am - 1 pm.\n\nLearn more about our programs at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family. No adoption fees, and we help with medical costs!\n\nApply to become a family: www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\nUpdated: 1/31/21 KG",

X-rays revealed that this is a birth defect and it needs to be left alone. Joehee has no problem getting around and when he wants to run he just picks up that leg and runs on the other three. He also had to have all but two of his top teeth removed, and two nasal fistulas repaired. He is now all healed and feeling great. Joehee loves when the grandkids come and visit at his foster home, but he's just as happy when they go home. He would like a quiet home where he can sun himself on the deck, and curl up in a soft, warm bed at night.",

            "description": "This is Stewie!\n\n10-year-old Stewie and his brother Chip became Frosted Faces on January 12th through our Final Wish program. Their devoted pet sitter reached out to us after their owner passed away, and no one in the extended family could take them.\n\nChip and Stewie are very friendly and sweet boys!\n\nChip and Stewie have gone on several hiking dates with our volunteers and have earned rave reviews for being VERY good boys! One shared, \"I can't say enough good things about these two little gentlemen! They are excellent car dogs! Not a peep! Laid down, looked out the window, jumped in and out easily. We walked 2 1/2 miles and they could have gone more, especially Chip. He's part Energizer bunny! Stewie kept up, though! And just when I thought he was worn out, he came back to FFF and played fetch! They have table manners! We stopped for Wendy's before going back to FFF and got them each a plain burger. They waited patiently, never nipped, never tried to grab our own food, never once crowded us while we ate. Stewie loves cuddles and hugs, but on a walk, Chip is all business. Wanna pet him? Fine, but he doesn't care much one way or the other lol. They are clearly a well-mannered, sweet as pie, bonded pair of brothers. Any family would be lucky to have them!!\"\n\nStop by our next Open House and meet these well-behaved and fun boys!\n\nVisit us at Open House: Saturdays & Sundays, 10 am - 1 pm\n\nLearn more about our programs at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family. No adoption fees, and we help with medical costs!\n\nApply to become a family: www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\nUpdated: 1/31/21 KG",

            "description": "Meet Lumpia!\n\nLumpia and her younger brother Brees entered San Diego Humane Society-Escondido for emergency boarding when their elderly owner became ill. When their owner went into a nursing facility, SDHS reached out to us to exit Lumpia and Brees and find them a new home together. Lumpia is 10 years and still adjusting to life without her mom; Brees is 7 years old and a happy boy. We tried to give Lumpia lots of extra loving to comfort and reassure her.\n\nBoth went to College Animal Hospital for diagnostics. While Brees is pretty healthy, Lumpia has a grade 2/6 heart murmur with severe dental disease. She has dental surgery coming up this month, and they will also try to fix her cherry eye. She has small bladder stones that we need to try to dissolve with a urinary diet, too. To help the pair decompress, we sent them to a foster home. and we are so lucky a family agreed to foster TWO Frosted Faces!\n\nIf you are looking for mellow pals who are already housetrained, you have an instant family in Brees and Lumpia! Their Foster Mom shares, \"Brees and Lumpia are the sweetest! They are our first bonded pair and having the two of them together definitely makes things easier since we never have to worry about either getting lonely. They're both eager for attention, but are also fine just hanging out with each other when we're doing errands around the house. They now eat regularly morning and evening after they had a few days in our home. I was super impressed at how great they were with baths! They didn't move around at all and just took it! They both love walks. We usually take them out for about a mile morning and evening.\n\nLumpia (Chihuahua) is a calm, loving, patient, kinda derpy, little sweetheart. She's always trotting steadily along after Brees on walks. Although she's usually the one in the rear, she will always wait for Brees, rather than darting ahead. Brees will explore around the house and Lumpia will follow just to see what's going on and join the party. She loves meeting other dogs. She'll start RUNNING to catch up to a dog to just sniff and say hello, and then she's satisfied. She has a few health issues that we wouldn't really notice interacting with her daily, except for her smelly breath, which she's getting dental surgery for soon!\n\nBrees (mixed spaniel) definitely acts like the youngest child. He's brave, bold, energetic, and very photogenic. He will start begging for pets if he sees Lumpia getting more attention than him. He loves playing with squeaky toys and is pretty good at fetch. He's a cuddle bug and always likes to be near you. He gets excited about seeing other dogs, but doesn't know how to properly meet them on walks. He'll just spin around a few times when he gets near them and then continues walking. Sometimes I think he's just feeding off Lumpia's excitement and copying her, but he's really a people person.\n\nWe've had so much fun with these two so far. Very loving, easy going siblings!\"\n\nApply to meet this lovable duo at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply/\n\nVisit us at Open House: Saturdays & Sundays, 10 am - 1 pm.\n\nLearn more about our programs at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family.

            "description": "Meet Brees!\n\nBrees (formerly Honey Bear) and his older sister Lumpia entered San Diego Humane Society-Escondido for emergency boarding when their elderly owner became ill. When their owner went into a nursing facility, SDHS reached out to us to exit Brees and Lumpia and find them a new home together. Brees is 7 years old and ready to party, while Lumpia is 10 years and still wondering where her mom went. We tried to give Lumpia lots of extra loving to comfort and reassure her.\n\nBoth went to College Animal Hospital for diagnostics. While Brees is pretty healthy, Lumpia has a grade 2/6 heart murmur with severe dental disease. She has dental surgery coming up this month, and they will also try to fix her cherry eye at the same time. She has small bladder stones that we need to try to dissolve with a urinary diet, too. To help the pair decompress we sent them to a foster home and we are so lucky a family agreed to foster TWO Frosted Faces!\n\nIf you are looking for mellow pals who are already housetrained, you have an instant family in Brees and Lumpia! Their Foster Mom shares, Brees and Lumpia are the sweetest! They are our first bonded pair and having the two of them together definitely makes things easier since we never have to worry about either getting lonely. They're both eager for attention, but are also fine just hanging out with each other when we're doing errands around the house. They now eat regularly morning and evening after they had a few days in our home. I was super impressed at how great they were with baths! They didn't move around at all and just took it! They both love walks. We usually take them out for about a mile morning and evening.\n\nLumpia (Chihuahua) is a calm, loving, patient, kinda derpy, little sweetheart. She's always trotting steadily along after Brees on walks. Although she's usually the one in the rear, she will always wait for Brees, rather than darting ahead. Brees will explore around the house and Lumpia will follow just to see what's going on and join the party. She loves meeting other dogs. She'll start RUNNING to catch up to a dog to just sniff and say hello, and then she's satisfied. She has a few health issues that we wouldn't really notice interacting with her daily, except for her smelly breath, which she's getting surgery for soon!\n\nBrees (mixed spaniel) definitely acts like the youngest child. He's brave, bold, energetic, and very photogenic. He will start begging for pets if he sees Lumpia getting more attention than him. He loves playing with squeaky toys and is pretty good at fetch. He's a cuddle bug and always likes to be near you. He gets excited about seeing other dogs, but doesn't know how to properly meet them on walks. He'll just spin around a few times when he gets near them and then continues walking. Sometimes I think he's just feeding off Lumpia's excitement and copying her, but he's really a people person. We've had so much fun with these two so far. Very loving, easy going siblings!\"\n\nApply to meet Brees and Lumpia: www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply/\n\nVisit us at Open House: Saturdays & Sundays, 10 am - 1 pm.\n\nLearn more about our programs at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family. No adoption fees, and we help with medical costs!\n\nApply to become a family: www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\nUpdated: 1/24/21 KG",

            "description": "Meet Kola!\n\n14-year-old Kola entered South LA Shelter as a stray who appeared to be in rough shape. We made Kola a Frosted Face on January 10th and took her to our vet for an exam, full body x-rays, and bloodwork. As expected, the x-rays showed severe hip arthritis and some spondylosis in the lower lumbar spine. Her lung x-rays were consistent with age. And there was really good news - her blood panel was all normal! Kola is now on pain and anti-inflammatory medications.\n\nKola surprised us and started following us around the lobby and tracking down toys! She also likes to work on bones. It has been so rewarding seeing her act like a dog! A wonderful vet donated some time and did acupuncture on our girl this week.\n\nThere is no better place for a dog like Kola than in a home, so we sent her off on a Frosted Fling for more individualized care. She\n\nis enjoying the comforts of being in a home! Her Fling Mom reports that Kola is being a very well-behaved houseguest who enjoys taking naps on her cozy bed and short walks around the block. She takes her meds easily in a piece of lunchmeat and hasn't barked yet!\n\nCheck back soon for the next update on Kola's Fling!\n\nVisit us at Open House: Saturdays & Sundays, 10 am - 1 pm.\n\nLearn more about our programs at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family. No adoption fees, and we help with medical costs!\n\nApply to become a family: www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\nUpdated: 1/19/21 KG",

He is 7 years old and weighs 82 lbs.\n\nAdmiral is living in a Foster home, and we've learned a lot about this hunk of love! His Foster mom shares, \"He's perfect. He is a dream come true. He has done nothing but smother me with love and attention and affection. He is the goofiest, sweetest, squeezy dumpkin cupcake cutie pie of a dog and that's just surface stuff. I had purchased for him a no pull harness (you know the ones with the ring in the front?) and guess who walks with a slack leash now? Also, I was noticing that he steps into my personal space when we were walking, so I gave him corrections by stepping into HIS space, and by last night he was walking alongside me like a perfect angel.\n\nAdmiral is so good with kids. ... He follows me everywhere and sits with me during zoom sessions while I work, but he will leave my side if one of the kids calls him, and he is super sweet and friendly to everyone who walks through our door. He has not met a stranger! Admiral already knows sit, and last night I showed him \"down\" and by the third try he did it! He doesn't chew, he doesn't bark, he takes corrections and retains them, he's just wonderful.\"\n\nOther fun things we've learned about Admiral: he\n\nloves to play with and cuddle stuffies, and t\n\nug of war is his favorite game. He is very gentle when taking treats, but he eats meals with such enthusiasm that a slow feeder is beneficial to keep him from inhaling his food! Although he's a big boy, he is able to hop in a SUV, no problem!\n\nAdmiral is ready for family! Apply to meet him: www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nVisit us at Open House: Saturdays & Sundays, 10 am - 1 pm\n\nLearn more about our programs at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family.

Showing signs of chronic neglect, his body condition is still a bit rough but this has not seemed to affect his generous heart. Max loves people and always greets shelter staff with a smile and a wagging tail.\n\nMax is a large dog and has many of the characteristics of his breed- pluses like loyalty and close companionship, but also some things that will require experienced dog guardianship like leash reactivity and possibly some separation issues. But we are sure that with a loving, stable home and some structured support and guidance that he will be a wonderful representative of his breed and a devoted companion for his new family.\nAdoption Center: (415) 506-6225\nThe Marin Humane Society 171 Bel Marin Keys Blvd., Novato, California 94949\nEmail: adoptions@marinhumanesociety.org",

Buster has been a little shy since arriving at Frosted Faces, understandable given the recent upheaval in his life. One of our volunteers took him for a hike, and he loved it! Buster is on leash and a good walking buddy.\n\nBuster has been called Mr. Smiley because he always has a big grin on his face. This handsome guy is still getting used to his new surroundings. He is taking some time to warm up to new people and would be great with parents who are patient with him. This little guy is looking for his forever home, would that be you??\n\nVisit us at Open House: Saturdays & Sundays, 10 am - 1 pm.\n\nLearn more about our programs at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family. No adoption fees, and we help with medical costs!\n\nApply to become a family: www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\nUpdated 2/1/21 LM",

She is enrolled in our obedience class and is busy impressing her handler with how quickly she learns new things. Vega likes people but has not been around children and consequently is nervous around them. We do not recommend a home with small children for this girl. Teenagers and older who can understand her shyness are a better fit. This 2 year old has lots of energy and is happy to be your new walking buddy. Visit her page at\ngsroc.org\nand complete the online application if you think she is the one for you!\n\nPlease go to our website and complete an adoption application at:\n\n/https://www.gsroc.org/application/\n\nAn adoption counselor will contact you to go over your application and assist you in determining which dog may be best for your particular situation.",

            "description": "Hello, my name is Bronx. My foster mom likes to call me Bonkers, I just can't imagine why! Hee hee! I have been in Minnesota since March and according to my family, I have made a lot of progress, they are very proud of me. \n\nWhen I first got here, I was afraid of everything. I'm still pretty easily spooked but if you let me come to you, I will let you pet my head and back. When I get used to you, I will put my head in your lap and ask to be petted. When we go outside together if you throw a kong or a ball for me, I will fetch it as many times as you throw it. I haven't quite figured out the part about bringing it back, but I will drop it near you. I also enjoy a good game of tug o war and am incredibly strong. \n\nI ADORE my resident dog and I definitely need a home where there is another dog to show me the ropes. I do have a lot of energy so might do well with someone who can keep up. My parents brought a little kitten in to our family and we became fast friends. I play with her and am very gentle. \n\nI am fully potty trained and will let you know when I need to go outside. I also know what it means when you say \"\"crate\"\". I will go in there and that is where I sleep.\n\nThe only concerns my family has are that I do like to chew on things so having a selection of chew toys is a good idea. Also we have not had much success with walking with a leash. I cry and whine when my brother goes on his daily walks but still don't want anything wrapped around me. Due to this and how spooked I can get, I need a fenced in yard in my new home. \n\nIf a sweet, gentle, handsome, energetic boy is what you are looking for, I'm your guy! I can't wait to meet you!\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nAll our Warrior Dogs will have all age appropriate medical care and vaccines, a microchip, and spay/neuter before adoption unless age is a factor with a puppy younger than 6-12 months at the time of adoption. If that is the case, the spay/neuter will be covered in the adoption fee and the owner will be responsible to have the procedure completed at a Warrior Dog Rescue Veterinarian at the appropriate time.\n\nPlease note that the majority of our dogs in rescue are from shelters where they have been found as strays or abandoned. Their breed description is based on our very best educated guess based on physical characteristics and their dispositions. If they came to our rescue as an owner surrender, the breed description will be listed as provided by the previous owner.\n\nAdoption Fee - $450\n\nTo apply for this pup, please submit an Adoption Application at http://warriordogrescue.com/adopt/adoption-application/",

He was good meeting other dogs at the shelter but did not play. People friendly. Will need experienced guardian and home with yard. McQueen loves to run and need active home for daily long walks/hikes. Needs basic training. More info. to come from his foster home in 2 weeks.\n1/22/21 Update: I walk him at least two times a day (sometimes three) so that he behaves at home. He is such a sweet and friendly boy but he's very energetic! He loves to play tug-a-rope and then zooms around the yard at top speed. A good sized fenced-in yard is a must. He LOVES being out in the yard with access inside. He has never had an accident in the house. He's a work in progress with other dogs. On walks he whines and pulls but I'm continuing the training with the gentle leader and doggy saddle bags. He is a beautiful dog and people stop me pretty much every time we go out to ask \"What kind of dog is he?''. He's a medium shedder. I've been brushing him with a Furminator.",

            "description": "Six and a half years ago, we took a beautiful 7-week-old puppy home after not having dogs for over 30 years. Our jobs kept us from having enough time to care properly for a dog. So, in retirement, we found this beautiful German Shepherd pup from a family in Puerto Penasco, Mexico, where we live, that had been raising Shepherds for over 40 years. Diega was one of eleven puppies from a registered mom, and we were told the father could be registered but was not. As she grew and developed, it became evident to us and many around us that dad must have been a Belgian Malinois. Her temperament, coloring, and body shape seemed to confirm it. When the opportunity came to ask the owner, he confirmed it.\n\nSo here we are, two older retired folks, living on the beach, with no dog training experience, but an amazing love for this energetic puppy. She loved to run on the beach and in the desert, hunt crabs, and she is a sniffer....the best nose in Sonora! \n\nShe is approximately 70 pounds.  She developed seizures but takes a daily gabapentin and has been seizure free for over 2 years.  She also is on a small daily dose of Incurin, a hormone.  She has been very healthy.  Additionally, she is extremely intelligent. A house without cats is highly recommended. \n\nWe travel with her everywhere, and she developed a real love of Motel 6 and Circle K hot dogs! She's visited dog parks in several states, but her best by far was in Colorado Springs! In 2019 we traveled across the US, and she was our constant companion. \n\nBut there were also challenges. With no experience in dog training, although she quickly learned the basic commands, her energy and need to \" have a job\" were unfulfilled. She has always needed a more energetic and disciplined life. We just were not knowledgeable or able to provide it. When we moved off the beach, that provided more freedom, into a residential area in Penasco, she was faced with a small yard and only leashed walks. She became much more agitated by dogs in her territory and walking became more of a challenge. When a final attack on a small dog occurred, we knew we could not provide her with what she needed.\n\n She loves belly and butt rubs and gets them every morning. She plays with our year-old puppy and loves to tease him with a ball or a toy. They are inseparable. My husband has too often shared a snack from the refrigerator and, if you open tuna can or a wrapped cheese slice, she's there in a nanosecond! She honestly has been my constant companion, 24/7, for all of these years. But I know that when you so dearly love an animal, you need to give them what they need, not what you need.\n\nSo the time has come to let Diega spread her wings and be the dog she can become. If you take her on, have knowledge, patience, and you will have the dog of your dreams. She has been ours!\n\nWe will require GSD/Belgian experience or the correct knowledge and lifestyle for this breed. \n\nhttps://petstablished.com/adoption_form/11077/generic",

She is a gentle girl who is shy and timid at first. She warms up quickly, but needs an adopter who will be patient while she becomes comfortable. She is young and playful, but also likes to lounge around.\n\nTrinket is in a foster home and is doing great! While she isn't fully potty trained yet, she has already made progress and should be there in no time. She does well in her crate. Trinket definitely loves people - in fact, when she gets nervous about something, the best way to comfort her is by giving her a hug. If that doesn't show what a sweetheart she is, we're not sure what will! Trinket does jump up to give hugs, so she may knock a tiny tot over on accident. Trinket can be nervous on her leash at times and she'd love an adopter who will help her gain some confidence. No kids under the age of 10, please.\n\nIf you'd like to make Trinket your new best friend, please fill out an application to meet her! Her minimum adoption fee is $265 plus a $12 fee, if 4 months or older, for rabies registration for McLean County residents.\n\nShe has been spayed, microchipped, vaccinated, heartworm checked, dewormed, and is on flea and heartworm preventatives.\n\nFor information about this dog's breed(s), visit: http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/abc.htm \n\nTo fill out our adoption application, go to: http://fs16.formsite.com/WishBoneCanineRescue/adoptionapplication/index.html",

Sadly, when we learned about him being at the shelter, he didn\u2019t even have a name, so we named him Cricket.  He\u2019s around 4 years old and is a super sweet boy who loooves people and toys, but would be best as the only animal in the home.  We need to find an adopter or foster for him ASAP.  Cricket was adopted through the rescue, but his current owner is moving and cannot take him with him.  His time is very quickly running out.  Will you help him? \n\nNot only is this stud muffin a big fan of toys, he also lives for going on walks.  Cricket gets so excited for his walks that he actually dances around when he sees his leash!  It\u2019s hysterical!  He does require a lot of space to run and for someone to be loving and patient with him.  When he is not out-and-about running around or chewing on his favorite toy, there is nothing more he would prefer than to be a big ol\u2019 cuddle bug!  This sweetness will make you want to adopt him today.  Seems to have a bit of separation anxiety, but does get used to being home alone.\n\nCricket does require a bull-savvy handler because of his strength and excitability.  He is an absolute sweetheart with people and is super trainable, but is leash-reactive and gets animated around other dogs/animals.  However, he can easily be redirected.  Because he is such a strong boy, would be best in a home with older children since he doesn\u2019t know his own strength.\n\n\nPlease help us get Cricket into a safe, loving forever home!  If you're unable to help by adopting, sharing this post or donating is always appreciated.  Don't forget, Passion for Pitties is a 501(c)(3), so all donations are tax-deductible!\u2026every little bit helps!\n \nIf you would like to adopt loving Cricket, please fill out an application at www.passionforpitties.com under the \u201cAdorable Adoptables\u201d heading.\n",

This sweet girl has a perma-smile, and is equal amounts play and lazy. She would do best in a home with a fenced in yard, unless you REALLY enjoy cardio! \n***She does well with other dogs, but is an alpha lady and can be picky on who she wants to play with. A home with no cats, and no young children will be needed. Denali is not aggressive to children, but is very playful at times for small children. Denali does not like kitties***\n\nWe know there is a perfect home just waiting for a beautiful, fun, and loving girl like Denali! If you feel you may be the perfect match, Denali wants to let you know she is ready to adore you as well!\n\nApplications can be filled out at:\nWWW.LITTLEREDBARNDOGRESCUE.ORG/ADOPTIONAPPLICATION\n\nIf you already have an application on file, no need to fill out a new one! ???\n\nMy adoption fee is $250 and includes all my vaccinations for Distemper/Parvo/Bordatella/rabies, spay,  CVI, heartworm/tick borne disease testing, preventatives and lifetime registered microchipping!",

            "description": "Horatio is one suave, chocolatey colored hunk! You can tell from his soulful eyes that he has a tender, sensitive heart. He is not a boy to give it all away upfront; Horatio can seem a little timid or aloof at first, and he is all business on walks, preferring to follow his nose to the next interesting spot. But increasingly, he is showing off his affectionate and sweet side, as a sort of preview to what we think he'll be like in a home, away from all the distractions of the kennel. It seems he'll make an attentive, fond companion to his people! Back scratches in particular seem to be a quick ticket into his heart. He seems like an overall lower-key guy, though he has some strength on walks! We guess that Horatio knows to do his business outside. He is around 4 years old and weighs a sturdy 75 lbs.\n\nVisit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog to set up a meet with handsome Horatio!\nDue to COVID-19, CITY DOGS is currently doing adoptions by APPOINTMENT ONLY. Please visit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog to request a meet and greet! \n\nQuestions? Email: citydogs@city.cleveland.oh.us | Call: (216) 664-3476\nVisit: 9203 Detroit Avenue Cleveland, OH 44102\n\nHours:\n10 AM - 3 PM Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday\n10 AM - 6 pm Tuesday & Thursday\n\nFee: $61 | Includes spay/neuter, shots, microchip, license, 30 days free pet insurance (when registered upon adoption)\n\nThe CITY DOGS mission is to increase adoptions from the City Kennel by changing the image of the pit bulls who make up the majority of the kennel population, by preparing all adoptable dogs in the kennel for lives in loving homes and by creating as many opportunities as possible for the public to meet and get to know our dogs for the terrific pets they are meant to be.\n\nOur Adoption Process...\nHere's a little about how things work:\nAll of the CITY DOGS posted for adoption are available for direct adoption from the kennel, unless noted otherwise. You must schedule a meet with a dog in advance - we are not currently accepting walk-ins. Please look online first to see if there are any dogs you think would be a good fit for your home before scheduling a meet. To get the process started, visit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog and fill out the form. One of our adoption counselors will get in touch to schedule and confirm your meet! At the kennel, an adoption counselor will introduce you and your family to the adoptable dogs, share information we know about them, and discuss our suggested ways for successfully integrating a new dog into your home. You are welcome to meet multiple dogs. If the dog you adopt is already fixed, he or she may leave with you that day - otherwise, the dog can go home after receiving the spay or neuter surgery.)\n\nAbout Our Dogs: All available dogs have gone through a behavioral and medical assessment. This assessment is a snapshot of who the dog is at that given time. We cannot make any guarantees with regard to behavior, temperament or health of any City Dog once they are in the home. Most of our dogs are picked up as strays, so we do not know what kind of home environment they were living in (i.e. with kids, other dogs or other cats), nor do we know if most of them are house trained. Everything we know about them is based on volunteer and staff observations. We do have some dogs in foster homes, where they will have more information about how the dog is in a home environment. It is very hard to tell with certainty whether or not a dog will be good with kids, cats or another dog. If you have kids in the home or another dog, we do require that they be present for a meet and greet with the dog you are considering for adoption.\n\nHeath/Vaccinations: Dogs that are adopted directly from the kennel need to go to your personal vet within two weeks of leaving the kennel. All dogs receive their DAPPL, Rabies, and Bordatella vaccines, though you may be required to get follow up boosters. All dogs come microchipped and with a Cuyahoga County license.?  \n\n\n\n \n",

Ziggy's foster mom says, \"Ziggy is just an all-around perfect pup. I think he would do well with anyone. He gets a long great with my dogs, a German Shepherd Mix and a Weimaraner, but I\u2019m sure he would do well as an only dog too. He is potty and kennel trained and walks well on a leash but gets excited and does pull a little. He rides well in the car and is always down for a walk or a car ride but also loves to snuggle on the couch or in bed with his human. He is the SWEETEST little guy!\" Good vet history, a fenced yard and a live or virtual home visit is required for approval. Fee: $200. Apply online: http://secondchancedogrescuela.org/.../adoption-application/. Thank you for sharing this pet!",

I rarely bark.\nGood with Dogs? I would LOVE a playmate!\nGood with Cats? Cats are boring, I ignore them!\nGood with Kids? Older kids, if you please!\nGood with Strangers? I need slow intros and space!\nPotty Trained? I'm working on it!\nCrate Trained?\n\nI'm working on it!\n\nInterested? Learn more about Baja Blast below!\n\nAbout Baja Blast:\n\nHi! I'm Baja Blast, and I'm a sweet lab mix that came from SD about a month ago with all my siblings, and now I'm ready to look for my forever family! I have the cutest little expressive eyebrows you've ever seen! I've been spending a lot of time with my foster family and my brother, I love to play and wrestle. I am a little shy still - it takes me a little bit of time to warm up to new people, and small kiddos make me a bit nervous. But once I get to know you, I'll love you forever! I would do best in a home that has another dog to help me learn the ropes of being a confident adult pup! I'm looking for a family that will be able to keep up with my energy, but also would like to just lay around with me during nap time. And of course, someone that will be patient with me as I get comfortable in my forever home! Is that you? Apply to meet me today!\n\nAdoption Fee: $550\n\nTraining Requirement: Obedience Level 1\n\n*Foster to Adopt: I am looking for a forever home now, but I still need some puppy shots, and I need to be neutered on 1/29 in Minneapolis. So I'm looking for a family that will be able to commit to bringing me to all of my appointments with TCPR until I'm ready to be fully adopted by you!\n\nMEET ME/ADOPT ME: If you'd like to arrange a meeting or begin the adoption process, please fill out an adoption application by visiting www.twincitiespetrescue.org/adopt/adopt-a-dog/ . A volunteer from Twin Cities Pet Rescue will contact you once your application is reviewed.\n\nFOSTER HOMES NEEDED!!! Twin Cities Pet Rescue is a volunteer-run, foster home-based organization. We can only rescue as many animals as available foster homes. Please consider saving the life of an animal in need and become a volunteer foster home today. To become a foster, fill out a dog or cat foster application on the Twin Cities Pet Rescue website: www.twincitiespetrescue.org . There is little to no cost to foster an animal. Twin Cities Pet Rescue provides its foster families with food, supplies, and veterinary care for its animals. All you need to do is supply the love!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Twin Cities Pet Rescue does not adopt to homes further than 60 miles from the Minneapolis/St. Paul Metro Area.",

She is now back inside again, but will need to be refreshed on her house training. She is crate trained, but will have accidents, if not let out often. She does not like cats, but seems to get along with other dogs her size, although she is not fond of small dogs. She does not like any dogs near her food bowl though, but is fine with people handling her while eating. She can be a little hyper at times when excited, as most terriers can be, but does calm down quickly. Nova would be a great companion for someone willing to give her the time and love she craves. \nContact: realdogrescue1@yahoo.com",

            "description": "Lennon sure has captured our hearts! It is not common that a young dog has an old soul, but 2 year old Lennon most certainly has. He is a gentle, kind dog with the perfect mix of mellow energy and playful fun. He is affectionate and sweet with people - he loves to learn in for a snuggle or a sneaky kiss. When it comes to his dog friends, he's incredibly playful with other social dogs and patient and tolerant with other dogs who are learning the ropes. He has been a star of playgroup and has mixed well with both male and female dogs. Because of his social nature, Lennon may enjoy sharing his home with another friendly, social dog or may be the perfect pup for play dates with friends. Lennon is a smart boy who would love to learn new skills and tricks through positive reinforcement training. As a young dog, he may enjoy an active lifestyle as your adventure sidekick but he is also able to settle and relax when it's time to chill. Lennon was found as a stray so his history is a mystery but we know that this boy is now ready for a life filled with love, cozy beds, and tasty meals",

            "description": "OUR ADOPTION APPLICATION AND PROCESS ARE AVAILABLE AT WWW.SOHODOGRESCUE.ORG, AND OUR ADOPTION FEE IS $275\n\nAvailable!\nWalter is a love of a dog who is ready for adoption!  He is an Australian Shepherd mix, just 18 months old and he is a great weight at 46 pounds.  He has the most interesting merled coat with lots of white and a full tail.  Walter is housebroken, crate-trained (but not an enthusiast), and he is learning his basic obedience commands.  Walter walks pretty well on leash and is getting more comfortable riding in a car.\nWalter loves people.  He is a high-Velcro, social guy who loves to do whatever his humans are doing \u2013 walk, hike, play fetch, whatever is happening!  Walter can be a little too Velcro when his foster family eats, as he is convinced that their food should be his food, but he is learning!  Walter also absolutely loves to play with other dogs, and playing chase and wrestling are his favorite dog games.  He is a medium-to-high energy boy with an \u201coff switch\u201d; when playtime is over he loves to snuggle and if no laps are available he will quietly chew on his favorite dog bone.  Walter is not good with cats.\nThe ideal home for Walter is an active one, ready to welcome a happy, friendly dog into their home.  This higher energy guy would love a fenced yard and another playful dog close to his size \u2013 he is quite the dog-wrestler!  He would also do well with a family who loves to hike and play, and who will continue his training to be an all-around great dog.  Walter still jumps on people when he is happy to see them, so children should be at least 12, and unfortunately, he cannot share a home with cats.  Walter is so smart, so happy and so ready for his forever home.  If you are ready for Walter apply today!  Walter is fostered in Atlanta, GA.\n",

She went to the local \"shelter\" there. (last picture). We were alerted about her condition and her needs and we wanted to help. Coordinating getting her from Mexico was an ordeal, but we made it happen. She finally arrived at her fosters at 9:30 at night in labor. At 8:30 the following morning, she delivered 6 beautiful puppies. It's her time now. She is super loving, energetic and will require an active lifestyle. Her foster has a cat she pays no attention too. \nAll dogs in our program are current on all their shots and micro chipped.  Also included is one FREE group session with our amazing trainer to his Street Obedience Class is included and not to be missed.We do not place dogs on a first come first serve basis, but rather to the home best suited for them. An adoption fee, application, and contract are required. All our dogs can be met with an approved application.  We do not place dogs on a first come first serve basis, but rather to the home best suited for them. Thank you for looking at a rescue dog for your next family member!

He loves to run and gets very excited when he's let in, but does calm down after a bit. He knows some commands like sit, hush, drop an stay but for a very short period of time. Not sure how he does with cats but he gets along with all other animals big or small. He is also good kids of all ages. He is definitely more of a woman's dog, although he does warm up to men, if given some time. He is protective and does not like any kind of violence or sudden threatening moves towards women or children. He does pull when on a leash, but with more leash walks, he should improve. Tank is a really sweet and playful boy, who will make a great family dog, for a family that understands his loyalty and is willing to give him time, love and attention in return.

EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY:  Meetings at our Adoption Center are by appointment only (no walk-ins).  An online adoption application is required and must be approved prior to meeting any animals.  Adoption appointments are set up by email by our Adoption Coordinator (no phone calls, please).  This process ensures our dedicated time to the animals in our care, as well as full attention to adopters at scheduled times.  \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

He is approx 2 years old, he if full of energy, loves running around. He knows sit and shake, he takes treats gently, he rides good in the car. We do not know how he is with other dogs or cats. A dog intro would be required. Be familiar with the breed.\n\nHe would do best in a home with older kids he jumps on you at times. He can knock down a little one by accident. Kids 10 and older would be best.\nHe needs to have a home with a backyard, he has energy. No apartment/condo\n. He enjoys going on walks he does pull a bit on the leash.\n\nHe is full of life and deserves to be spoiled with a loving family, neutered, he is up to date on his vaccines and microchip.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this dog, you can text 480-359-7109 for more information or fill out an application at www.underdogaz.com\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This dog is courtesy posted for another individual or Rescue.

            "description": "It was a chilly, blustery January winter\u2019s day when Athena was given her first opportunity to experience a Humane Society bark park outing. This 11-month-old pup paid no attention to the bitter cold as she pranced and danced with her amazingly pure, from the heart, non-stop smiles gracing her face. The photographer\u2019s fingers had become numbingly attached to his camera, but that sensation had become almost unnoticed as Athena\u2019s buoyant, joyously playful energies brought a captivating warmth to all of the bark park participants. She would rush up to you with an unmistakable look of come-and-join-the-fun and then quickly pirouette to entice the gift of a gently taken hotdog treat. Athena performs instantaneous sits, occasionally followed by a down and then a roll over onto her back to invite a tummy touch. It was an incredibly entertaining session that lifted the spirits of all, humans and canines alike. At times, Athena seems somewhat unsure of how to interact with other dogs. We suspect that she was in an environment that didn\u2019t provide enough socialization with other canines, but she is intelligent and really wants to please and will be a competent student.",

He performs an instant sit on request and when called, will happily come running to you. Boone has earned an A+ rating on his social bark park skills as he playfully interacts with other canines of any size, gender, or breed. He showed special respect toward a much smaller, younger dog who was also enjoying the bark park experience. Boone loves to play ball, chasing it joyfully but he has yet to learn that fetching it will ensure his human\u2019s continual collaboration. Boone is a friendly canine who sports a blazing white vest and a strikingly handsome brindled coat.",

            "description": "For up-to-date info like events, closings, new animals, success stories please LIKE Manchester Animal Shelter on Facebook!\n\nGypsy and Tyson...A Bonded Pair!!!\n\nGypsy is a white 12 year old female Pittie mix weighing 65lbs. She is bonded to her brother Tyson. Tyson is a brown 5 year old male Pittie mix weighing 75lbs. \n\nGypsy and Tyson have been together their whole lives. Both of their owners passed away recently, leaving them alone. Family feared they would be separated if they stayed in NC, so they made the big trip to NH in hopes of finding their furever home together. Let's hope their trip was worth it! \n\nGypsy is a spunky lady full of life and energy! She's a go getter! She loves life and everything it has to offer. She's very social and loves to know everything that's going on. :) She is the more independent one of the two.  \n\nTyson is a calm, gentle lover. He likes the quieter, finer things in life; a nice walk, a snuggle on the couch watching TV, a nice massage ;)...He can be quite silly, too and is a blast to play with! \n\nThese 2 cuties will need to be adopted together. They would do best in a home with children 12+ years old. If you would like to fill out an application please email canines@manchesteranimalshelter.org \n\n\nAdoption fee is based on age:\nPuppies 8 weeks through 7 months are $400\nDogs 8 months through 7 years are $325\nSenior dogs over 8 years are $125 \nSeniors for Seniors (Seniors 65+ adopting over 8 years): $75\n\nAll adoptable dogs are spayed and neutered, have age and time appropriate vaccines, microchipped and heartworm tested. Other medical care provided might include treatments for fleas, ear mites, dental work or infections or other medical conditions. Additional vaccinations and medical care (including puppies Rabies shots if adopted at under 12 weeks of age) will be the responsibility of the adopter.\n\nIf you have questions you can call our office at 603.628.3544. To request an application, please email canines@manchesteranimalshelter.org\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: As with all of our dogs, we strongly recommend obedience classes for new owner and dog to create a life-long bond with the adopted dog based on trust, respect, and rewarding training experiences. Our shelter dogs are strays and we observe and assess their behavior at the shelter which may be somewhat different in a home environment.",

It will take time for him to accept and feel safe with any other dog in the house. It took us 2 weeks before Cody could interact with our 2 labs without a gate between them. Based on his behavior and scars on his backend lead us to believe he didn\u2019t have good interactions with other dogs before being picked up as a stray. If a potential adopter has a dog they must understand Cody will need time and patience before he will be okay with their dog. The other dog will need to be laid back and young since Cody can be quite annoying sometimes with play. He\u2019s still learning social skills and how to play without being so rough. Our 2 have adjusted to his play and let him know when enough is enough. Our female, Daisy, is the alpha and Cody does well with her with no aggression. Taking a walk is a real struggle. He PULLS and is very strong. Now that he\u2019s done chilling out from the last HW injections we will start taking some walks to see if we can get any improvement. Stairs are still a challenge. He wants nothing to do with 5 or more steps. We\u2019re still working on house training. He wandered into another part of the house this week and peed. ???? Meal time is a joy now that Cody doesn\u2019t try to make a seat for himself at the table. He now lays down next to us while we eat with no interest. He hasn\u2019t counter surfed in awhile either. He\u2019s interested and will put his nose up to smell but hasn\u2019t tried to get anything in weeks. Crate time is a breeze and enters on command! He does have a prey drive so no small animals in the household for him. This boy has improved so much but does need more training. He will make a great companion for a family that is dog savvy and willing to continue training. It\u2019s not his fault he only knew how to survive on the streets and fend for himself. ? Cody ?",

She asked someone to go and feed her dogs for her. The stench and filth were unbearable. She and these dogs were living in conditions that are hard to imagine. She has became a ward of the state and her dogs were surrendered to us. We thought that we had found Leo his forever home but he was so happy to have a home where he was loved that he became protective of his new owner. Sadly, this was more than she wanted to deal with so she returned him to us. He needs someone who understands that his greatest fear is being abandoned by those he loves. Please help us find him a forever home! \n\nCOMPLETED APPLICATIONS TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER INQUIRIES! IF you are interested in adopting, the FIRST step is to complete an application!

Bella was an extremely\n\nshy girl when we first started fostering her. She was timid and put\n\nher head down in fear and shame. She is now understanding what it\n\nmeans to be loved and to live in a safe place. Bella is a quick\n\nlearner and motivated by hugs. All you have to do is tell her that\n\nshe is a good girl and she gets her tail wagging in accomplishment.\n\nShe leaves treats behind for loving attention. This girl would do well\n\nas a companion, cuddle buddy, and protector. She is playful and\n\n\"cat-like\" in the way she paws at things. Bella is the most deserving\n\nof your love and kindness, and will be able to accomplish so many\n\nthings as she wants to please, she will just need some encouragement\n\nand a lot of patience until she feels comfortable enough to be ready\n\nto train.\n\nAbout Me:\n\nHello, I am Bella! I am kinda shy at first, and I've begun to trust\n\nhumans again. I love to know where my five foster humans are at all\n\ntimes. If one of them leaves, I notice and feel a little sad. I like\n\nto follow and investigate where everyone is and I'm especially happy\n\nwhen everyone is together-it makes my job a lot easier! I am trying\n\nto get used to my kennel, but I would much rather lay around nearby\n\nyou. My heart is getting filled a little more each day with a lot of\n\nencouragement and patience from my foster family. I am happy now, I\n\nwag my tail, smile, and do all sorts of things that make my foster\n\nfamily laugh. I have some toys that I love and I pretend are the only\n\nmine, but I only like to play this game! I really am a great girl and\n\nwant to be your best friend!",

            "description": "Born in July 2020, Percival is a male blond Chihuahua. He plays well with other dogs of various sizes in his foster home as well as the cat. He is mostly potty trained and one of his favorite places is in his crate with a cozy blanket. Percival is not a hug fan of riding in the car, got car sick a couple of times but did fine when he sat on his foster mom's lap. He loves balls and stuffed toys. Percival's forever home will require a secure fence with adults or adults and children over 5. Applications can be accessed at www.mikeyschance.com\n\nNo children under 5. \n\nLike all Mikey's Chance dogs, this dog will come to you from a foster home that has provided loving one-on-one attention, socialization and some basic training, as well as quality food and exercise. \n\nApplications can be found at www.mikeyschance.com and completed on a computer, tablet, and/or phone. Please note that adopters are not chosen on a first come, first served basis, but full consideration is given to the best fit for the dog AND the adopter. Applications can take up to 3 weeks to process. Application submission DOES NOT guarantee approval for adoption.",

More details below.\n\n **During the current health situation**\n\nIf you are interested in ADOPTING from the EDISON ANIMAL SHELTER, please email the shelter manager, Becky Snyder at rsnyder@edisonnj.org and she will send you an application to fill out and discuss potentially setting up a meeting. The subject of the email should be \"Adoption - Pet's Name\". Thank you. Be safe and stay healthy.\n\nADOPT ME!  Say hello to WALTER! He is about 10 years old and is such a DOLL!  Just look at that SMILE! He would love to be a couch potato and just hang out with you.  He likes to go on short walks, and he likes to play a little too. We feel that he needs a quiet home without any children or other pets to live out his golden years in peace.\n\nHe has some skin issues (at least for now) so he will need to be on sensitive skin food. Please consider giving this sweet boy a second chance for love.\n\nAll of our shelter dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, microchipped and up to date on their vaccinations prior to adoption. \n\nFor our shelter updates, check out Friends of the Edison Animal Shelter Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/edisonanimalshelter\n\nTo view all of the Edison Animal Shelter's available pets on Petfinder (which includes pictures and bios), please click on the following link: https://www.petfinder.com/pet-search?shelter_id=NJ593\n\nInstagram\nhttps://www.instagram.com/edisonshelter/?igshid=1b8ab04w24mb6",

She has a dominant personality for her pint size but also loves to snuggle and give her people doggie kisses. One of her favorite things is to snuggle up and sleep with another dog after a fun filled play session. Peaches will require a secure fence and preferably children over 8 due to her size. Applications can be accessed at www.mikeyschance.com\n\nNo children under 5. \n\nLike all Mikey's Chance dogs, this dog will come to you from a foster home that has provided loving one-on-one attention, socialization and some basic training, as well as quality food and exercise. \n\nApplications can be found at www.mikeyschance.com and completed on a computer, tablet, and/or phone. Please note that adopters are not chosen on a first come, first served basis, but full consideration is given to the best fit for the dog AND the adopter.

This 7-8 year old has had a lot of overcome and is making progress every day.\n\nGus was found by a family in the rural Panhandle of Texas. Gus was all alone and no owners were found. When Gus was rescued he got a nice bath and we expect to see his coat get shiny as he continues to adjust to good nutrition and care. Due to being alone for so long, Gus is shy. He wasn't used to being part of a family and everything was scary. In the time he's been in rescue, he's learned that humans can be kind and caring. We can't blame the guy for being a bit skeptical after what he's been through.\n\nGus LOVES his crate and enjoys spending time relaxing and snuggling. He would prefer a quiet home that's calm and caring. Because he has been through a lot, we recommend we be placed in a home without other pets. Gus likes to learn and would benefit from continued education. He is also proud to share he has learned how to use the doggie door!\n\nGus just wants a home that will love him. Does Gus sound like your guy? Fill out an application to adopt now!\n\nBCRRT is a Texas based rescue with fosters in TX and OK. Our adoption areas are TX, OK and surrounding states. We do not allow shipping/transport of dogs to other states. If you are interested and would like to apply please visit: https://bcrrt.com/adoption/ and fill out an application form.",

Riva\u2019s ideal forever home will be one with breed experience with a family who will be dedicated to providing her training so she can be the best dog she can be. She will require a home with a secure 6 foot fence. Riva\u2019s forever home must be with adults or adults with children over 5 (no exceptions). Applications for this gorgeous pup can be found at www.mikeyschance.com.\n\nAll large and/or active dogs will require a full fenced (6ft) secure yard. \nNo children under 5. \n\nLike all Mikey's Chance dogs, this dog will come to you from a foster home that has provided loving one-on-one attention, socialization and some basic training, as well as quality food and exercise. \n\nApplications can be found at www.mikeyschance.com and completed on a computer, tablet, and/or phone. Please note that adopters are not chosen on a first come, first served basis, but full consideration is given to the best fit for the dog AND the adopter. Applications can take up to 3 weeks to process. Application submission DOES NOT guarantee approval for adoption.",

            "description": "Born January 13, 2020 Ace is a male American Bully. This adorable pup has a grade 5/6 heart murmur and will require medication and regular vet care throughout this life. Here is what his foster mom says about him, \u201cThis compact hunk is looking for his forever family. He is housebroken and uses a doggy door, crate trained but currently sleeps in bed with his foster mom, I mean how can u say no to a face like this. Ace is still very much a puppy and will chew up toys and the occasional thing he is not supposed to but learns fast on what is appropriate. Knows sit, lay down and walks great on a leash. Ace currently lives with dogs from small to large but is a very rough player, very mouthy and will pester dogs until they play with him so would do best with dogs larger than him. He also lives with a feline friend but will give chase wanting to play. Ace is very food motivated and his manners go straight out the window when food is involved. We are working on taking treats easily and waiting for food but it\u2019s been very difficult for him. Ace likes cuddling before bed, food, walks, playing with his canine siblings and water. Dislikes vacuums and lawn mowers, they are evil!\u201d Ace will also require a secure 6 foot fence in his forever home with adult or adults and children over 8. Applications can be accessed at www.mikeyschance.com\nNo children under 5. \n\nLike all Mikey's Chance dogs, this dog will come to you from a foster home that has provided loving one-on-one attention, socialization and some basic training, as well as quality food and exercise. \n\nApplications can be found at www.mikeyschance.com and completed on a computer, tablet, and/or phone. Please note that adopters are not chosen on a first come, first served basis, but full consideration is given to the best fit for the dog AND the adopter. Applications can take up to 3 weeks to process. Application submission DOES NOT guarantee approval for adoption.",

In fact, I am so amazing at snuggling some people may call me clingy. Is that a bad thing? I think it sound AMAZING! I think other dogs are amazing but I also think getting all the attention is amazing so please make sure I get enough love and cuddles. I think kids are amazing too! \n\nRight now I am doing pretty good on potty training so not quite amazing but I have come a long way. I do know how to use this amazing thing called the dog door. I have had a few accidents but getting better every day! Crates are NOT amazing and I really dont like them but I am a very good girl in the house and I don't chew on stuff.\n\nAmazing Masey is spayed, hw negative and updated on shots. She is a petite 20lbs and only 2 years old. Masey is fostered in the Omaha area and her adoption fee is $350.00.

We rarely respond to messages sent via PetFinder, so if you have a question, please fill out the contact form on our website. Thanks!\n\nFoster is a beautiful solid black, 1 year old, male Pointer mix who might be part kangaroo. He can jump 5 feet from a standing position and uses his vertical when he meets new people, when he wants inside, or when his people come home. He loves everyone he meets including kids. He currently lives with a 4 year old and a 9 year old and does great with both. Any kids in his forever family will need to be large dog savvy given his exuberance and size. \n\n\nFoster weighs in around 60 pounds, but is tall and skinny. Once he gets to a healthy weight he'll probably be closer to 70 pounds. Due to his near constant motion he would do best with a family that has another large active dog. He loves to wrestle and play chase and be outside as long as he has a playmate. He is not particularly dominant or submissive, but does test boundaries like most young dogs. He is currently doing well in a home with a large 2 year old male and 1 year old female.\n\nFoster has slept well crated and with his 9 year old foster kid. When crated he whines/barks intermittently for a minute or two then settles down. He's mostly house trained and only has the occasional accident. He knows \"sit\", \"no\", and comes when he can tell you want him. He's a quick study, very responsive and even listens to commands from the kids. He isn't much of a barker, but does bark when he gets super excited, like waiting for meal time. He isn't terrible on a leash but does need work on leash manners.\n\nOther items of interest about Foster: He wasn't fazed by the NYE fireworks. He doesn't seem to care to play with balls or toys.He gives dainty kisses but is the sloppiest drinkier. He doesn't like baths. He hasn't tried to escape out the front door or over the fence, but will need 6ft fencing or efencing. Not sure if he's oblivious or doesn't care, but he hasn't shown interest in squirrels or birds. He's all over the place in the car and needs to be tethered or crated.\n\nFoster is a very sweet young guy who is looking forward to finding an active forever family. He is already neutered and scheduled for his vaccinations 1/14. He is being fostered in Severna Park, MD. Please fill out an adoption application if Foster interests you!",

He is a handsome loving 8 year old boy.  Nitro is fully house trained and loves any chance to snuggle next to you or under a blanket. He is a big boy but he doesn\u2019t try and jump up on you when he plays.\n \nHe definitely could use some more training on a leash as he does pull. He is quite strong so paying attention on walks is important as He will pull when he sees a bird or squirrel. He has no problem meeting people/dogs on or off leash. He is chatty though so he barks and whines in excitement. He is a neat drinker and eater and hardly sheds at all.\n\n Nitro does love to run around and  is an agile climber, 4-5 ft high wire gauge fencing is not an option so he requires a yard with secure, solid 6-ft fencing or efencing. He definitely loves his walks and running outside. Nitro is not a fan of car rides so this will require more work to make him comfortable.\n\nHe will do better in a home where he can have his family with him. Leaving him does cause him stress. He will go in a crate but is not a fan of it at all. He has been left out not crated for short intervals and has done fine. He doesn\u2019t touch anything that is not his. He shows a lot of improvement when we practice leaving to help him gain his confidence.\n\nNitro is so lovable and willing to please. He is a great dog! Nitro is being fostered in Baltimore, MD. If you are interested, please fill out an adoption application.",

We rarely respond to messages via PetFinder so if you have a question, please fill out the contact form on our webpage. Thanks!\n\nPetey is a handsome neutered 10 year old male GSP, weighing 50lbs. Petey was surrendered to rescue when his owner's living situation changed. \n\n\nPetey loves the children in his foster home. He is a spunky dog who is quite happy hanging by your side or going on adventures. He walks well on a leash and rides beautifully in the car. Petey is house broken and working on his obedience. Petey loves toys and has a drive for fetch just as strong as a young pointer. Petey is happy to play fetch until your arm falls off! Petey sleeps happily on a dog bed at night and does not try to steal the bed if you have to get up.\n\n\nPetey is currently in 6ft fencing and doing well. Due to his prey-drive Petey should not live with cats (he sometimes gets over excited and points the scotty dog door stopper at his foster's house)! Rescue has not observed Petey around dogs, but he seemed ok with them when he was at the vet. Any introductions would need to be controlled and not rushed to see how Petey does.\n\n\nPetey is being fostered in Washington, DC and is patiently waiting for his forever home. If he interests you, please fill out an adoption application.",

I am a pretty shy guy who takes some time to warm up and so far I prefer the women in my foster home. I am learning how to be a dog and new things tend to scare me. I am learning that my foster family's other dogs are ok but I'm not sure about them yet (even though I'm bigger than all of them). I sleep through the night in my crate and find that my crate is my safe space. I walk well on a leash and I know how to sit, come, and wait. I love soft treats and I am just learning that playing with toys is fun. I get startled by sudden movements so a home with children 13+ who will respect my space would be best. I am a very sweet boy who loves to follow my foster family around now that I had a chance to get to know them and I love to give them kisses and show them my belly. I am about 6 years old and I am looking for someone patient who will allow me time to get to know them. You can also watch for stories, pictures and videos about me on our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/groups/40103261297/ Ask to meet me today!!\n \nAdoption fee: $375\n \nAdoption fees for all dogs/puppies include a $50 refundable training deposit.

This puppy is currently in foster care learning home etiquette, kennel training, and housebreaking. We would love for you to meet this puppy and see if it might be a good fit for your home. \n\nThe first step to adoption is completing an adoption application on our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org. Pending approval, your application is valid for 1 year, and you will be eligible to request a hold on an individual animal. The hold does not require that you adopt the animal, but ensures you get to meet and make an adoption decision prior to other applicants. Hold times cannot exceed 5 days. Also pending approval, you will be able to acquire foster home contact information, so you inquire on personalities of specific animals.\n\n***COVID-19 Update: While we typically host weekly Saturday adoption events, in order to follow the CDC's recommendation for COVID-19 protocols, we will be suspending our weekly Saturday adoption events until given the clear. Adoptions for individual animals will occur by private adoption appointment and/or adoption handoff. Appointments and handoffs are scheduled pending staff, foster home, and vetting schedules. Because we are 100% foster-based, adoption appointments and handoffs are only offered for individual animals. When adopting at an appointment, please be aware that you will be taking the animal home that day. We can not hold animals to be picked up at a later date.\n\nDue to CDC's recommended COVID-19 protocols, we are highly encouraging foster homes and adopters to speak with one another via phone or video chat to ensure compatible matches and limit in-person contact. If meeting in person, our foster homes are encouraged to wear masks, socially distance, and choose an outdoor meeting spot. Should you want to proceed forward with the adoption, all adoption paperwork, medical records, and adoption fees are to be completed electronically. Quick and low-contact animal handoff is also being encouraged amongst foster homes and adopters. As always, we include a one-week trial period with all our adoptions.\u00a0***\n\nPlease note, we do not have the ability to process adoption applications at our adoption events, so please plan accordingly. If an application is submitted past 5pm on Monday-Thursday, it will begin review the following day. If submitted on Friday-Sunday, it will begin review on Monday. It takes approximately 48-72 hours for an application to be processed.\n\nFor additional questions regarding meeting this dog please contact us via text/email at 970.699.6772, or contact@bounceanimalrescue.org. We apologize for any inconvenience, but due to a high volume of inquiries, calls and voicemails regarding adoption will not be returned.\n\nThank you for choosing adoption! If you would like more information on our organization please visit our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org.",

He has most certainly had a hard time in his life. But also some really good ones. He was rescued from a kill shelter. He is shy of strangers at first but comes around quickly. Just a good scratch or a nice treat and your his new best friend. He is more scared of men than women, but he does come around after a few gentle words and lots of hugs/pets lol. He loves to be hugged and petted. He loves going for walks or runs. He is high energy (like all huskies). He is leash-trained, house-trained and crate-trained. He bathes well and brushes great. He rides well in the car. He is learning basic commends well and enjoys the attention. He is great with other dogs, but not with cats. He should be fine with kids, he's so gentle. He loves treats and toys. He really likes to be with his people. He is a talker but not a barker and will have whole conversations with you. He would love an active family to play with and show him that there are good people in the world too. He'd make a great agility dog because he is so smart, willing to please and has some awesome moves lol.\n\nDUE TO THE FACT THAT THE VOLUNTEER IN CHARGE OF THE RESCUE EMAIL IS OUT WITH COVID PLEASE SEND ALL INQUIRIES TO THE FOSTER MOM JENNY AT foster.pups@yahoo.com\n\nAll of our dogs listed are in foster homes. Please email or call for price and more information on the gorgeous dog. Adoption fee includes spay/neuter and up-to-date shots. Adoption fees also help us buy food, medicine, and other expenses for our animals. If you have any questions, please contact Last Hope Cat Kingdom  at friends@lasthopecatkingdom.org.",

            "description": "I'm Paloma, but I also listen to the name Potato!\n\nI originally came to Paws it Forward over 7 years ago. At that time I was terrified of humans and had a very rough start to life. I was lucky enough to find my family and I was able to learn that I actually love humans! Unfortunately, lately I had been getting into disagreements with my senior K9 sibling and my humans had to make the difficult decision to put me back into Paws it Fowards care. \n\nMy ideal home would be one where I am the only pet as I can get very jealous when another pet is getting my humans attention. I also can be protective over my food as I don't like to share! \n\nMy people say I am a sweet soul at heart. I am happy to go for walks or snuggle on the couch, whatever my human would like me to do with them, I will be right there by their side! I enjoy having older kids around (10+) to play with and love. I can still be timid around some humans sometimes so I would need a family that has patience with me. However, I will be very loyal to my people and give them my undying loyalty and love once I am comfortable around them. \n\nI love being outside and do great on a leash. I even like this white stuff on the ground! I also enjoy going for car rides because it usually means I get to be with my human and go somewhere exciting. I am quiet in the house and you only hear from me when I'm feeling happy. I am very obedient and listen to what my humans say. \n\nA note from my current foster mom, \"If you are allergic to bees, this is your dog! Paloma is passionate about hunting bees in mid air. She also makes us laugh and does a great impression of jumping goats.\"\n\nI was lucky enough to find a great family once, I know my next and final family is out there patiently waiting for me to come into their life! \n\nIf you are interested in adopting me, please fill out an application on our website www.pawsitforward.org\n\nMy adoption fee is $350",

While at the shelter Brenda became bonded with her now BFF and companion Rue, also on the site. These tiny girls have been through a lot together and find great comfort in each other and need to be adopted together. They're now safe and enjoying life in a loving foster home receiving the veterinary care they'd been needing. Brenda's foster mom reports that she is very tiny, very sweet and calm and would enjoy a quiet household She loves belly rubs and walks up to you when she wants attention. She isn't as active as Rue and their foster brother, but she can keep up with them! She's completely house trained but waits until Rue decides when it's time to go out. She's an absolute delight Due to their tiny sizes, it would be best if Rue and Brenda go to a home with no small children. Older responsible ones would be okay. If you're looking for a precious pair of sweet housetrained girls to add to your family and share life with, please submit an adoption application for Brenda and Rue.

            "description": "UPDATE as of Jan 30th: Because of considerable interest in this dog, we are no longer accepting new applications.\n\nWell hello, my name is Simon!\u00a0And I\u2019m quite a catch if I do say so myself.\u00a0I\u2019m a 1-year-old, 50-ish pound Shepherd mix, and I already can\u2019t wait to meet you.\n\u00a0\nI LOVE meeting humans and other dogs.\u00a0Sometimes I get a little carried away though and jump up to show you just how happy I am to meet you.\u00a0But I\u2019m totally willing to work on that.\u00a0Besides meeting new people and animals, I really love to play with toys and chew on bones. I do better with toys that are super durable because I\u2019ve set actual records for destroying plush toys in seconds.\u00a0And I get really excited when my people play with me.\u00a0Sometimes I nip a little when I get too excited, so it might be best if my new family doesn\u2019t have really young humans--I wouldn\u2019t want to scare anyone.\n\u00a0\nIt may sound like I\u2019m bragging, but I am a really great houseguest.\u00a0I\u2019m totally housebroken, and if I have to go potty, I\u2019ll come up and pester you to let you know it\u2019s time to go out. I\u2019ll sleep in a crate if you want me to, although I have a whole room to myself at my foster home, and I love having a little space at night.\u00a0During the day, I\u2019ll happily nap at your side wherever you are. I also love to go for walks or play outside.\u00a0 Fair warning, I love meeting other humans on my walks, but I\u2019m very polite about it.\u00a0Sometimes I pull when I see a rabbit or a squirrel, but mostly, I\u2019m really good on my leash.\u00a0My foster family says I\u2019m a total goofball with a lot of energy. I love to burn off my energy on walks or running around the yard, and then I\u2019m very content snuggling by your side or with my head in your lap. And if you give me tummy rubs, I\u2019ll be the happiest boy ever.\n\u00a0\nMy ideal home would have a fenced yard and would be cat free.\u00a0Honestly, I love cats and would chase them around the house all day long, but my foster mom tells me that cats don\u2019t really like that so I should probably not have the temptation.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo, what do you think?\u00a0Are we a match made in heaven?\u00a0I sure hope so. If you agree, you know what to do! Can\u2019t wait to meet you!\n\nInterested in adopting this dog? Visit our website (http://www.SecondCityCanineRescue.org) to fill out an application and to find out where this dog may be shown this weekend.\n\nWe love our dogs. We want happy lives for all of them and are looking for the home that provides the best fit for each dog\u2019s individual needs. Please understand that there may be multiple families interested in this dog. \n\nAlso, please know that the breed mix listed is simply a guess. In most cases, we don\u2019t know their background. We encourage you to base your decision on individual personality and pet qualities instead of relying on our guess.\n\nPlease understand, we only adopt our animals out near the Chicagoland area. Questions? Email us at adoptions@sccrescue.org. Hope to see you become part of the SCCR family!",

            "description": "Hi there! Thanks so much for taking a look at me. I'm a sweet girl who has loads of energy and lots of love to give!! I do pull slightly on my leash when out for a walk, but I promise, let me calm down and I will walk a bit better. I LOVE to be with or near my handlers, but I get so excited!! I run around, I jump and I'm just all over the place, only because of how excited I am. Please take that into consideration, that I do need help learning not to jump on my hoomans! Again, because of my excitement I would recommend allowing me to calm down before proceeding with handling or petting; teaches good behavior! If you need help in that field, please feel free to ask these people taking good care of me! I love to play with my handlers as well, but because of my excitement level and arousal, I'd recommend a home with children no younger than 10, just because of how hyper I can be! I love to play with squeaky toys, but if you want it back I'm going to need something in exchange! So, I currently know sit and because I love treats, maybe I can learn new tricks? Although, if you're going to feed my treats I would recommend no tiny fingers! I take a little roughly. :( Now dogs, they seem soo cool! I get so excited that I will pull to greet them and greet them in their face! Which may come off a bit rude, so allow me to calm down and after I'm calm, I will say hi to them respectfully. I can't help it! I'm just so excited. Overall, I would recommend myself in an active home helping me learn new behaviors and a home dedicated to training. I hope to meet you soon!",

As soon as the bone was removed from Ruckus mouth, he was a wagging, happy boy!\n\nRuckus is very happy, affectionate and attentive. He gives great eye contact, and sits for treats. Ruckus loves to explore a yard, or snuggle with you. \n\nRuckus is a taller pitbull mix, around  a year old. He greets dogs well on the leash.\n\nRuckus is a good fit for older children. He would prefer a yard, but it is not a requirement. But he is an active, excited boy! He currently lives in a foster home and does great! \n\nApply here to adopt Ruckus: rebeldogsdetroit.com/applytoadopt",

Her wound swelled up and her eye was nearly closed shut when we got her and her siblings, and finally, she is ready for her forever home.\nAthena was born on 10/30/20 and is a lovable, spunky girl. She will likely be medium sized full grown, on the lower side around 30 pounds or so. \nAthena loves to play dress up, snuggle, and run around with her sister, who is almost fully recovered as well. \nShe is up to date, microchipped and fully dewormed. Her bite marks and wounds are a thing of the past and give adorable character to her, she has never let what happened to her stop her.\n\nAthena is forever home ready and an example of the amazing things rescue can do for our animals who need us the most\n\nPlease note: as with most rescue puppies, we have no way to guarantee this puppy\u2019s breed or size potential. \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq\n\n*Any breed labels used by Take Paws Rescue, its employees/volunteers, or on vet records provided cannot be guaranteed.  Breed labels are given based on information obtained during intake and/or best guesses based on appearance and/or temperament of the dogs and Take Paws Rescue gives no assurance to the accuracy of these labels. Labels are necessary for postings to many animal networking sites, such as Pet Finder, and are no way a guarantee. Additionally, exact age and potential size cannot be guaranteed.",

She does great with her canine foster brother, although she's confused why he keeps trying to play with her. Sadie has never had an accident in the house, and taught herself how to use the doggy door at her foster home. She likes to sleep on her foster mom's feet in bed, and snores like a little piggy. She does have that great beagle bark when she gets excited, so intruders beware - she'll come tentatively lick your leg and make you fall in love with her!\n\nSadie would do best in a home with a canine companion and no children under age 6.",

Jazzy loves to play fetch and will keep at it all day.  She is active and would benefit from positive training. They are extremely playful and keep each other busy.  Jazzy is too active for young children and most likely cats.  Jazzy is the dog with more white on her chest and collar area.\n\nJazzy is at our Ringwood location at 260 Margaret King Avenue where she is available from 3-5 daily or by appointment.  Our application can be found at www.BASSshelterpets.org.  All adoptions are held outside, masks required.   \n\n",

I'm a confident girl who is social with people, but not very social with other dogs. Looking for a home with no pets, please! I'm an intelligent girl so you better keep up! I'm happiest if I can be with my person as much as possible and do not appreciate confinement. You will hear those husky songs start singing until I get settled into my new space. I have a lot of love to offer the right person.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this pet, please call 541 474 5458 for an appointment. All appointments are made by phone for the most up to date availability of the pets and the schedule. Thank you.",

            "description": "***Thank you for your interest in Magnificent Mutts and Meows. We hope everyone is saying safe during this challenging time. Due to the current regulations set forth by Governor Pritzker on group gatherings we will not be having adoption events until further notice. As an all foster based rescue this means that all meets will be by appointment only. Your whole family must be available to attend the meet as there will be no second meets scheduled to help limit contact between our team and the public. To help streamline the process please make sure your current pets are up to date, you have landlord/HOA approval, and that you are prepared to take the dog home with you immediately before submitting an application. Thank you & Please stay safe!***\n\nSandy is a sweet girl who takes time to warm up to new people. She likes the company of children but does get startled when they run or jump so any children in the home should be well behaved and dog savvy. Sandy came into our rescue with her pups and is still learning she is now safe. She appreciates having a cozy spot to retreat to when needed but after a short time to regroup she returns for attention and treats. She loves squeaky toys and to snuggle up to her human while watching TV. She bonds to her person quickly and wants to be with them all the time so she would make a great companion! Sandy gets along with dogs, but dog in the home should be calmer to help ease her nerves as well. A quiet patient home is needed and we are certain with some time to open up she will be a life long best friend to whomever is the lucky person to adopt her!\n\nIf you are interested in adoption, please complete the Application to Adopt which you can find on our website (\nwww.magnificentmutts.org\n) No phone calls please. Emails only.\n\nAdoption Donation $300 (cash only)\n\nPlease visit www.magnificentmutts.org for the online dog or cat application.\n\nAdoption Fees*\n\nAdult cats starting at $125, Kittens starting at $165.\nDogs/Puppies starting at $225 minimum\nPrices subject to change, please contact for specific adoption donations.",

Her name is Mia and she is an absolute delight! \n\nMia is a lap dog and loves being held and cuddled by her human. The more attention she gets the happier she is. She will be a wonderful and constant companion.\n\nThis girl will need a home with someone who is willing to spend most of their time with her. She is quite vocal and will do best in a single family home.\n\nMia is a 7 year old Chihuahua who is up to date on her vaccines, microchipped and heart worm free. She will be spayed upon adoption. She recently had surgery on her knee for a completely luxated patella and torn ligament. She will most likely need the same surgery on her other knee. These issues were never addressed previously and this wonderful girl has suffered with the pain for many years.\n\nMia is currently in our Freeport location. Please download our adoption application and email the completed form to adopt@bobbicares.org if you would like to meet her. Kindly keep in mind that our adoptions are local only (Long Island, Queens, Brooklyn, Manhattan).",

            "description": "Meet Milly a.k.a Milady! She is a 4 year old, 45 pound, female, Belgian Malinois/Labrador Mix. We think Milly is just the prettiest dog in town! She will win your heart over the second you meet her with a gentle hand lick and her soulful eyes. Once she settles into a new place she will let her personality sparkle. Her foster mom lovingly called her a \u201cprancing reindeer\u201d as she loves to hop around the house and play with her toys when she is excited and happy. After some playtime or a nice walk, Milly loves to curl up in her dog bed or on the couch for a nice snooze. If you are settling in for movie night you better be ready to share your lap as Milly loves to lay down and rest her head on her person. She is a very quick leaner and is fully potty trained! She will sleep through the night in her dog bed and doesn\u2019t require a crate. She is excellent in the car for long rides\u2026 she will climb in on her own and won\u2019t make a peep from the backseat. Milly goes with the flow very well. \n\nMilly is looking for an adult only home with no young children, no other dogs, and a backyard. Milly can be selective about other dogs when on her leash, so needs a home outside of the city and although she can have dog friends, she does better being the only pet in the home. Are you the magical home Milly can finally call her own?! Submit your application for this gem today! \n\nNo urban homes, other pets, or kids! Milly is looking for a backyard in her forever home. \n\nMilly is spayed and up to date on her vaccinations. For more information about her, please fill out an application at www.ALRcares.com and email Grace@alrcares.com.  We schedule meet and greets for approved adopters only, an application is the first step in our approval process. Thank you!\n",

            "description": "We believe Frankie is a Terrier and possibly Heeler mix.\nHe is around ten months old and 30 pounds. He is a fun, busy boy.  He is working on his house training skills, and sleeps through the night in his crate. \n\nFrankie is learning to walk on a leash, and needs help learning to walk near traffic. \nHe will need someone willing to help him with this skill. \n\nFrankie is very friendly with people and loves other dogs. He is a very happy boy.\n\nFrankie has been here a week now and is settling in. He now will grab a bone and lie down and chew on it to keep himself entertained.  He would love a big yard to run in to play and burn off his puppy energy. He would be a good candidate to teach to play fetch and absolutely loves toys. He needs a fenced in yard as he does not have leash training enough to potty on a leash. Possibly a long line would work, but a fenced on yard is best.\n\nFrankie is neutered, up to date on vaccinations and is micro chipped. His adoption fee is 375.00.  If you would like to meet him, the first step is a completed application.  Please add city and state in the address line.\n Our dogs are in foster homes, so a completed and processed application is a must before setting up a visit.  \n\nYou can find them here\nwww.newdigsfordogsrescue.org",

            "description": "I'm Arlo. I'm a 1 year old Boxer mix.  I am really curious and like to watch what my foster family is doing.  My little doggy foster sister taught me how much fun running around and rolling in the snow can be.  We burn off energy together and then take naps inside.  I like to lay in the sun, but also spend time in a doggy bed where I can keep an eye on my family.  I use the time outside to take care of business.  I haven't had any accidents inside.  I really love cuddling and will sneak a kiss when you're not watching.  I really like food.  My foster dad says that makes me easier to train.  I'm pretty good at sitting but sometimes I need to sit for longer than I really want to.  When it's time for bed, I go right into my crate.  I sleep through the night without a sound, which is more than I can say for my foster sister.  She's good at playing though, she even pulled me across the carpet playing tug.  She shares her squeaky toys and bones with me, too.  I love being scratched on the head and behind the ears. I've done really well with car rides, too.  If you're looking for a loving companion, I'm your guy!\n\nIf you would like to be considered as a potential adopter for one of our great dogs, please go to our website- www.luckymuttsrescue.org and submit an application. Our application process includes landlord approval and vet checks. Please make sure all of your information is current and accurate, including a valid email address and phone numbers. Inaccuracies and/or incomplete data will delay and/or cancel your application.  We strive to process all applications in a timely manner, but with the high volume of applications we are receiving, it is taking anywhere from 1-3 weeks.  You may be contacted via email if there are concerns or questions.  Once all of your information is reviewed and if your application is approved, you will be notified via email.  Submitting an application and receiving an approval does not guarantee you will be adopting the dog you applied for.  Once you move to the meet and greet process, you will be contacted by the foster family to further discuss the dog, and answer questions you may have, and if applicable, a meet and greet will be set up at our adoption center.   Meet and greets are only set up with approved applicants, and we require all members in the household to be present, as well as any current dogs in the home. \n\nCurrent Adoption Fees Are:\n$400+tax for puppies to 3 years old\n$350+tax for ages 4-7\n$250+tax for ages 8 and up\nBonded pairs vary\n\nThe adoption fee covers spay/neuter, up to date age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, general deworming, heartworm test, (if over 6  months) and a certified veterinary inspection. Please be aware, listed dog breeds are based on information provided and cannot be guaranteed.  Submitting an application for a particular dog does not guarantee that you will be the applicant chosen, we receive several applications for each dog. Our adopters are picked based on the needs of the dog, and the home we feel with best fit based on your responses to our application, vet information and landlord requirements.   Approved applicants not chosen for the dog you applied for, will be in active status for a period of six months.  We encourage you to watch Petfinder, Facebook and our website for upcoming dogs.  Should you see a dog that interests you, please send us a Facebook message or an email with your approval number.  Please be patient with us, as Lucky Mutts Rescue is run strictly by volunteers and many of us work full time jobs, have families and also foster dogs. Thank you for considering Lucky Mutts Rescue for your next furry family member!",

This 1-year-old Great Pyrenees mix loves to be with her people, just looking for comfort and companionship.\n\nHousebroken and crate-trained, May\u2019s house manners are good \u2014 she rarely barks and doesn\u2019t chew inappropriately. She\u2019s looking for a quiet household (no loud noises, no other dogs, just quiet consistency) where she can build up her trust. May is not a big fan of the leash or of car rides. She loves hanging out in a snowy backyard.\n\nMay will do best as the only dog in a home, but at 85 pounds of fluff, she is all the dog you\u2019ll need! She is loving and gentle with the child at her foster home. \n\nIf you have a quiet home and are looking for a mellow solo dog to be your best friend, come meet May.\n\nInterested in adopting this dog? Visit our website (http://www.SecondCityCanineRescue.org) to fill out an application and to find out where this dog may be shown this weekend.\n\nWe love our dogs. We want happy lives for all of them and are looking for the home that provides the best fit for each dog\u2019s individual needs. Please understand that there may be multiple families interested in this dog. \n\nAlso, please know that the breed mix listed is simply a guess. In most cases, we don\u2019t know their background. We encourage you to base your decision on individual personality and pet qualities instead of relying on our guess.\n\nPlease understand, we only adopt our animals out near the Chicagoland area. Questions? Email us at adoptions@sccrescue.org. Hope to see you become part of the SCCR family!",

            "description": "Recommended an experienced home with kids age 12 and up who are gentle and respectful. Lottie is a moderate energy teenager at an awkward age. She sometimes presents as serious and somewhat judgy as she is figuring out her place in the world. Other times she presents as a silly, playful youngster. She is moderately social, mostly tolerant of handling and pulls on leash. She shows no interest in toys at this time, but hopefully she will loosen up and enjoy them soon. In the assessment when presented with a particularly yummy bowl of food she settled into enjoying it. She refused to budge from it despite a hard push from a fake hand. No other escalation shown. So we instigated a trade out upgrade as a training exercise. She participated in this exercise 3 times as an interruption of her meal and we let her finish the bowl. The last step into her food area resulted in a freeze and solid direct eye contact. We carefully resumed the last trade out for the bowl. Continuing this protocol is a must, in addition to a leadership training policy called nothing in life is for free. Lottie needs an experienced leadership home with rules dedicated to training and exercise. NOT CATS Dog to dog - 1st encounter: Met a medium sized calm mature male dog where she mostly ignored him and looked through him mainly checking out the environment. A few times briefly when in close proximity she would focus on him with pilo and a slight freeze before resuming ignoring him. A few days later, 2nd encounter: An introduction was done with a more confident, bolder adult male Pittie. She became pilo erect from afar, pulling towards, barking and general trash talking. Wanted to meet as an equal and rather full of herself. On closer encounter she was startled when he called her on it and hovered over her (ranking) and sniffing invasively. She finally (caved in her posturing) gave a light tail wag, became playful and jumped on the handler multiple times. So when confronted with a stronger personality she allowed invasive sniffing without correcting or avoiding- then went and jumped on handler out of mouthy arousal. She jumps excessively. In summary: Someday over the next year of learning she will be a high ranking female with dogs. Guiding her successfully through this period of learning will be formative in her adult personality to be cognizant of proper dog diplomacy and not become a bully. No off leash venues or multiple dog settings recommended.",

To adopt, complete our online adoption application and an Adoption Counselor will contact you within 48-hours to schedule your adoption appointment. Adoptions for any pets in foster will be completed offsite at our PetSmart Claiborne location on a case by case basis. The safety of our foster parents and community is of utmost importance to us and it will be at the foster's discretion if they'd like to meet at this time. Thank you for choosing adoption! \n\nThis girl is very sweet although she can be a little timid at first.  She would benefit greatly from basic manners training as she pulls on the leash.  She should be walked using a harness.  She is an explorer so enjoys a good walk.  She takes treats very gently and now all she needs is a loving family she can call her own.\n\nTo inquire about an adoptable animal from the Louisiana SPCA, please call 504.368.5191, ext. 150 to speak with an adoption counselor.\nTo see more adoptable animals from the Louisiana SPCA, please go to http://la-spca.org/adopt.\n\n\n\nThe petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n",

He is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4084697.\n\nUnfortunately, this is Buddy Chance's second time at the shelter and no one can understand why. He's a great dog that loves to go for a walk. He loves to play with toys in the play yard and he's an affectionate boy that will come up to you for pets. He loves his treats and will \"sit\" for them. He doesn't react to the other dogs in their kennels or when he sees them on the trail going for a walk.\n\nBuddy Chance is starting to have a hard time in his kennel and has been observed jumping up to see the neighboring dog. He needs a new home soon where his family will play with toys with him and take him for a walk. If you think Buddy Chance would be a good fit in your home, please bring the family and come and meet him today! If you have any other dogs at home, please bring them with you to make sure it will be a good fit.\n\nIf you are interested in saving this pet, please reach out via this link: https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/foster/BPAZ/Dog\n\nTo actually visit with this pup, please make an appointment here: https://mcaccappointments.as.me/adopt. NOTE: People who sign up for these appointments often no-show, and we have seen that you can generally show up and let them know you are there to meet this particular dog and the shelter will squeeze you in, except from 12-3PM or closer to the 6PM closing time. (Please know this is not a guarantee). If the dog is at risk, please ask for a supervisor to meet that particular dog.\n\n*Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG. MCACC is located at 2500 S. 27th Avenue, Phoenix. Different adoption fees/policy may apply. Please visit MCACC's website http://www.maricopa.gov/pets/locations.aspx for hours. You may also wish to call 602-506-7387 (PETS) and provide the animal's A# above to verify is still available.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Please contact Jenny Cope (giveadogahome@live.com) for more information about this pet.\n\nBe sure to read ALL information provided.\n\nA PET IS FOR LIFE -\nTHINK ABOUT THE INVESTMENT!\n\nNOAH was saved from a high kill shelter in Texas where dogs often have only 3 days to be saved. NOAH is neutered rabies, core vaccines, heartworm/tick disease tested negative for all. He is de-wormed, monthly preventatives and microchipped. At the time of rescue in the middle of January 2021, he weighed around 24.00 pounds and has an estimated date of birth 24 April 2020\n\n. We cannot say for sure what breed he is, so we expect families to do their own research on his look and size and decide what breed you think she is and if you have the lifestyle suitable for his needs.\n\nWhen Noah arrived at the rescue on 15 January he was in a double kennel with a few other dogs his age and had a great time playing and wrestling in the outside run, then when done playing, they would cuddle up on the elevated dog bed and recharge their batteries for their next play session.\n\nWith most dogs being adopted, Noah and the dogs still here have been relocated to the communal area where they have access to a large secure fenced in area where they are loving playing in the snow and enjoying the cooler weather. He does jump up as with all rescues wanting to get some attention, but this is easily fixed with training and he is very responsive.\n\nNoah is a medium sized dog, full of love, energy and affection, he loves to get his ears scratched and his belly rubbed. We are not able to say how he is around cats or livestock and so it is up to families to be prepared to work through any potential issues.\n\nNoah is a high energy dog so we are only looking for families who already have the lifestyle to incorporate this handsome boy into that life. A family that understands the importance of training and mental stimulation along with the physical needs of this young pup who will take him and ensure he is given lots of adventure and fun.\n\nMore pictures and possible video's can be found on his page on the rescue website.\n\nAll dogs use dog doors to go out and do their business or to enjoy the cool, fresh weather in their dog runs or communal areas. We cannot say if a dog is house-trained, however, we expect families to understand that all dogs need a transition period and accidents could happen and training is most definitely needed.\n\nYou MUST understand that dogs need time to decompress and adapt to their new environment and home. It is a HUGE transition they make from the kill shelter, being vetted, on transport for 3 days and arriving in Maine where the temperature and such is very different to what they have only known. In rescue there is what is known as the \"3 Point Rule\" Days 1-3 your dog is stressed, anxious, confused as to where they are now. Weeks 1-3 your dog is adjusting, settling in, learning things. At the 3 month point, your dog understands they are home, and have built up a trusting relationship where they feel loved and secure.\n\nAll dogs are fed Rachael Ray Nutrish PEAK Natural Dry Dog Food, Grain Free Western Grasslands Recipe with Bison. Rachael Ray Nutrish Peak Dog Food receives the Dog Food Advisor's second-highest tier rating of 4.5 stars.\n\nNOAH is available for adoption for an adoption fee of $550\n\nThis fee is not negotiable and is used to cover the rescue costs of pulling, vetting, health certificate, transport from Texas to Maine, monthly preventatives, supplements, food, general day to day cost of running a brick and mortar rescue and anything else that is needed. Canadian adopters need to know that customs charge 15% taxes when entering into Canada.\n\nDue to borders being closed, it is up to families to call the US and Canadian borders to find the current details on border crossing. Animal Welfare is deemed essential in the US, but quarantine rules entering back into Canada must be followed.\n\nIf you feel that you have the heart and home to give this precious soul a wonderful life, please go to our website, under the ADOPTION INFO tab, complete, then submit the APPLICATION. Our process takes around 1-2 days, and ensuring your references are aware that we will be calling, could speed up the process. Once you have been approved, we discuss any questions in regards to the dog you are wanting to adopt, then you complete and submit the contract, make payment and then we can work out the pick up / transport arrangements.\n\nPlease do NOT submit an application if you are not looking to take home a new best friend within the next few weeks.\n\nhttps://www.giveadogahome-sanantonio.org/forms/form?formid=5838\n\nALL Dogs are LOCATED AT THE RESCUE IN SEBEC, MAINE. We post in various states along the east coast and Canada where we have had lots of successful adoptions to enable more exposure for these beautiful saved souls. Families will need to be prepared to travel to the rescue to meet and take home their new best friend. Sebec is located just outside the towns of Dover-Foxcroft and Milo (approx 8 miles) and approx 45 miles from Bangor. There are also lots of hotels, motels, pet friendly accommodations and wonderful camp-sites for the more adventurous families and what a great way to get to know your new best friend.\n\nClick here to watch a video of NOAH.",

This sweet girl has clearly not had a fun past, when she was scared or unsure she would sit and face away from what she was scared off, or just sit facing the wall. She is super affectionate and when she was settled and comfortable loved getting her head scratched and belly rubbed. She was in a kennel next to her best friend Carl and after a few days of making sure everyone was settled I opened the gate in the runs so that they could play together and they snuggled together too. I was hoping to adopt them together, but sadly Carl has been adopted.\n\nAfter a week and most dogs getting adopted, I moved the remaining dogs in the kennel communal area where they have access to a large secure fenced in area and Aubrey and her new friends are having a great time - she still craves so desperately for attention and is the sweetest natured girl.\n\nShe deserves nothing but the best from the humans who open up their heart to her, she needs an active life, lots of adventures, exploring new places, with different sights, smells and sounds, she needs to be showered in affection and love and made to understand she will never have a horrible life where she feels she has to sit facing a wall again.\n\nWe do not know how Aubrey is around cats or livestock, however, we expect families to be prepared to adjust and work with any potential problems and ensure they can provide a safe, happy environment for everyone in the family.\n\nMore pictures and possible video's can be found on his page on the rescue website.\n\nAll dogs use dog doors to go out and do their business or to enjoy the cool, fresh weather in their dog runs or communal areas. We cannot say if a dog is house-trained, however, we expect families to understand that all dogs need a transition period and accidents could happen and training is most definitely needed.\n\nYou MUST understand that dogs need time to decompress and adapt to their new environment and home. It is a HUGE transition they make from the kill shelter, being vetted, on transport for 3 days and arriving in Maine where the temperature and such is very different to what they have only known. In rescue there is what is known as the \"3 Point Rule\" Days 1-3 your dog is stressed, anxious, confused as to where they are now. Weeks 1-3 your dog is adjusting, settling in, learning things. At the 3 month point, your dog understands they are home, and have built up a trusting relationship where they feel loved and secure.\n\nAll dogs are fed Rachael Ray Nutrish PEAK Natural Dry Dog Food, Grain Free Western Grasslands Recipe with Bison. Rachael Ray Nutrish Peak Dog Food receives the Dog Food Advisor's second-highest tier rating of 4.5 stars.\n\nAUBREY is available for adoption for an adoption fee of $550\n\nThis fee is not negotiable and is used to cover the rescue costs of pulling, vetting, health certificate, transport from Texas to Maine, monthly preventatives, supplements, food, general day to day cost of running a brick and mortar rescue and anything else that is needed. Canadian adopters need to know that customs charge 15% taxes when entering into Canada.\n\nDue to borders being closed, it is up to families to call the US and Canadian borders to find the current details on border crossing. Animal Welfare is deemed essential in the US, but quarantine rules entering back into Canada must be followed.\n\nIf you feel that you have the heart and home to give this precious soul a wonderful life, please go to our website, under the ADOPTION INFO tab, complete, then submit the APPLICATION. Our process takes around 1-2 days, and ensuring your references are aware that we will be calling, could speed up the process. Once you have been approved, we discuss any questions in regards to the dog you are wanting to adopt, then you complete and submit the contract, make payment and then we can work out the pick up / transport arrangements.\n\nPlease do NOT submit an application if you are not looking to take home a new best friend within the next few weeks.\n\nhttps://www.giveadogahome-sanantonio.org/forms/form?formid=5838\n\nALL Dogs are LOCATED AT THE RESCUE IN SEBEC, MAINE. We post in various states along the east coast and Canada where we have had lots of successful adoptions to enable more exposure for these beautiful saved souls.

NICK is neutered rabies, core vaccines, heartworm/tick disease tested negative for all. He is de-wormed, monthly preventatives and microchipped. At the time of rescue in the middle of January 2021, he weighed around 30.00 pounds and has an estimated date of birth 1 January 2020\n\n. We cannot say for sure what breed he is, so we expect families to do their own research on his look and size and decide what breed you think she is and if you have the lifestyle suitable for his needs.\n\nWhen Nick arrived at the rescue on 15 January he was in a double kennel with a few other dogs his age and had a great time playing and wrestling in the outside run, then when done playing, they would cuddle up on the elevated dog bed and recharge their batteries for their next play session.\n\nWith most dogs being adopted, Nick and the dogs still here have been relocated to the communal area where they have access to a large secure fenced in area where they are loving playing in the snow and enjoying the cooler weather. He does jump up as with all rescues wanting to get some attention, but this is easily fixed with training and he is very responsive.\n\nNick is a medium sized dog, full of love, energy and affection, he loves to get his ears scratched and his belly rubbed. We are not able to say how he is around cats or livestock and so it is up to families to be prepared to work through any potential issues.\n\nNoah is a high energy dog so we are only looking for families who already have the lifestyle to incorporate this handsome boy into that life. A family that understands the importance of training and mental stimulation along with the physical needs of this young pup who will take him and ensure he is given lots of adventure and fun.\n\nMore pictures and possible video's can be found on his page on the rescue website.\n\nAll dogs use dog doors to go out and do their business or to enjoy the cool, fresh weather in their dog runs or communal areas. We cannot say if a dog is house-trained, however, we expect families to understand that all dogs need a transition period and accidents could happen and training is most definitely needed.\n\nYou MUST understand that dogs need time to decompress and adapt to their new environment and home.

I, however, do not enjoy being home alone all day while they work so we were wondering if there is a home out there where I can be loved the rest of my days and have less time alone. I am living with another small dog and he gives me my space so we get along just fine! I do bark at the cat in the house but she is not scared of me - maybe because she is bigger! I am sweet and loving and would love to have a special home of my own. If you think I sound like the perfect girl for you, apply to adopt me today at buffalocares.org\n\nAdoption Fee: $175 RR048\n\nAll dogs come fully up to date on shots, microchipped, heart worm tested, de-wormed, on flea and heart worm preventative, and spayed/neutered.

            "description": "Personality: Gregory is a social, smart, athletic dog that is waiting for his forever home! He can be jumpy and excitable so it's good to reward him for keeping all four paws on the floor. Gregory is a high energy dog and would make an excellent running or hiking partner. Gregory would do best in a breed experienced, adult household who can provide plenty of physical and mental exercise as well as basic training to help guide him. \n\nHistory: He came to us from another animal shelter. \n\nDog/Cat Skills: Gregory can be overwhelmed and sensitive to forward, rowdy dogs. He prefers polite meets and has done well in a playgroup setting with calm, polite female dogs. He enjoys playing chase with minimal physical contact. He will correct dogs that are rude. He has a true shepherd play style and will mouth at the backs of other dogs in play and chase, and can be vocal and bossy. He has been introduced to several dogs on and off-leash, and needs appropriate, tolerant matches to be successful. We have not seen Gregory around cats. \n\nLeash Skills: Gregory pulls while walking on a leash and would benefit from the use of a front clipping harness.\n\nReady to meet Gregory ?

Unfortunately she must move this month as her landlord is selling her house and she cannot take all eight of her dogs with her.

            "description": "Jacob had a photoshoot to help capture his good sides. He's wondering where his forever family is and what's taking them so long to find him!\n\nJacob is a 1 year old shepherd mix. He is quiet and charming. I often tell my husband he should have been named Scooby Doo because of how expressive he is with his face. Jacob has lived his entire life in a shelter and therefore is timid in his foster home. He has been with us for 2.5 weeks and is slowly, but surely coming out of his shell more and more. He LOVES his foster sisters and could play with them all day in the yard. When I first brought him home, I couldn't let him off a leash because he was too afraid to approach us so it took me an hour to catch him in the yard and bring him back in. After two weeks, he met the photographer and took him only about 30-45 minutes to start taking treats from her hand.\n\nJacob will require an adopter who is patient and loving in order to give him the time he needs to acclimate at his own pace, but I can't tell you how loving and brave this sweet boy is. He is willing to try and trust when he has no idea what to expect and has quickly stolen my heart. If you choose to meet this beautiful boy, I'm sure he will quickly steal yours too!\n#adoptjacobAll SAAP animals are vet checked, UTD on vaccines, spayed/neutered, micro chipped, and given flea and heartworm preventative as age appropriate.\n\nOur website is: http://www.adoptastray.com/\n\nTo check if this animal is still available visit our master pet list on our website at:\nhttp://www.adoptastray.com/adoptable-animals/\n\nHave questions:\nPlease email us at saap@adoptastray.com for more information about this animal or to answer any questions you may have.

            "description": "Cuddles (goes by George) is a 15 year old purebred Bichon Frisee who was surrendered to a partner when he decided to get old. Cuddles suffers from extremely bad dry eye and is visually impaired most likely due to it being left untreated. We think he can see shapes if he is close enough but is getting around very well in the few days he's been in his foster home. He does have 3 different eye medications that he HAS to have twice a day. Unfortunately they are somewhat costly at around $150. Cuddles loves to, well, cuddle on the couch or roam the backyard. Cuddles would benefit from a home with minimal steps and a fenced in yard so he can roam around safely.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Cuddles complete an application to arrange a meet and greet. If already approved reply to your approved email.

My best fit would be a confident and experienced human friend that can understand my past and allow me ample patience as well as help me with confidence building. I am seeking a home where I can stay safely indoors and become a part of my human's everyday life. During my stay here at HALO, I have come out of my shell to be friendly, seek attention, enjoy treats and belly rubs. It will take me time to warm up in my new home and to become accustom to the ways of the house. I would do best in one that is not very busy with visitors or guests, so that I do not become overwhelmed. I would very much like as much as benefit from having a confident, friendly, and social dog companion in my new home to help show me the ropes. Some things that I am still working on and will need continued training on after my adoption are leash acceptance training and my vocalization. A relationship of structure, routine and guidance would give me the opportunity to gain my own confidence and help me become the best boy that I can be. Please contact my friends at HALO if you are interested in meeting me.",

I am a Great Pyrenees and I am sweet as can be! I have been around children, dogs, and cats and am gentle and friendly with everyone. I would love a male dog to play with in my new home. Besides being a beauty, I have a great personality too. When my foster dad greets me in the morning to go for a walk I have a special greeting for him. I bounce from one front foot to the other, my lips curl back in a smile and you can see my teeth, my tongue hangs out and I flop my head from side to side. I walk great on a leash and am house trained. I weigh about 85 lbs, will come to you spayed, up to date on vaccinations, microchipped, and up to date on flea/tick preventives. \n\nApplicants must have a secure and visible fence. In order for your application to be approved you must pass a home check and a vet check which includes having at least a two year vet history. I can be adopted in Missouri and surrounding states: Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, and Arkansas. My rescue is able to transport me to those states. If you would like to give me a furever home, please fill out an application on my rescue's website. \n\nBeing fostered in Holden, MO",

            "description": "If you're looking for the most gentle, old soul - look no further than Reno!  This 8 years young lad is an American Pit Bull Terrier.  Reno came to us weighing 122 pounds, but he  has worked hard on getting his weight down and is now a slim 89.6 pounds.   He's a calm fellow who is happiest lounging around the house while chewing on his bone.  Reno does great with other calm and gentle dogs, but a proper dog introduction is required.   \n\nReno has a chronic condition called panniculitis.  Panniculitis  is usually visible as a lump (in Reno's case it is a large mass on his left hip) , but it is actually inflammation of the subcutaneous fatty tissue. We treat it with an inexpensive steroid. This treatment keeps the inflammation at bay. Still it is likely that Reno will always have this condition and will occasionally have flare-ups.    \n\nIf you think Reno might be your perfect companion, apply today!  His minimum adoption fee is $195 plus a $12 fee, if 4 months or older, for rabies registration for McLean County residents.\n\nHe has been neutered, microchipped, vaccinated, heartworm checked, dewormed, and is on flea and heartworm preventatives.\n\nFor information about this dog's breed(s), visit: http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/abc.htm \n\nTo fill out our adoption application, go to: http://fs16.formsite.com/WishBoneCanineRescue/adoptionapplication/index.html",

He is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4508638.\n\nRascal was surrendered by his owner and he doesn't know why he's at the shelter. He's doing much better than when he first came in and now he allows the staff to leash him and take him for a walk. He walks easily on the leash and he comes up and sits next to people for pets. He likes his treats and takes them nicely. His previous owner said he loves to play with soccer balls but he doesn't like small animals and will chase them. He also likes to chase garbage trucks.\n\nRascal is having a hard time staying in his kennel and wants to go to a home where he can play with his soccer balls in the yard. The shelter is recommending that Rascal not go to a home with children. If you think Rascal would be a good fit in your home, please come and meet him today!\n\nIf you are interested in saving this pet, please reach out via this link: https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/foster/BPAZ/Dog\n\nTo actually visit with this pup, please make an appointment here: https://mcaccappointments.as.me/adopt. NOTE: People who sign up for these appointments often no-show, and we have seen that you can generally show up and let them know you are there to meet this particular dog and the shelter will squeeze you in, except from 12-3PM or closer to the 6PM closing time. (Please know this is not a guarantee). If the dog is at risk, please ask for a supervisor to meet that particular dog.\n\n*Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG. MCACC is located at 2500 S. 27th Avenue, Phoenix. Different adoption fees/policy may apply. Please visit MCACC's website http://www.maricopa.gov/pets/locations.aspx for hours. You may also wish to call 602-506-7387 (PETS) and provide the animal's A# above to verify is still available.",

            "description": "Age: 4\nWeight: approx 70 lbs\nLocation: Baltimore, MD\nNicknames: Nay Nay, Penelope Primrose\nGood with other dogs?: Yes.\nShe has not lived with dogs until coming to her foster home. She has met the dogs well.\nGood with cats? unknown, will not be adopted to a home with a cat\nGood with children? OK for kids over: 10\nActivity Preference: Both couch potato and marathon walker. She loves to go for walks (see more on this). Loves yard activity.\nIQ: Smart\nNaomi's favorite things: Nomming her blankie when she sleeps. Getting pets.\nNaomi is good at: meeting people, meeting dogs, behaving in the house, going for car rides, playing with toys gently\nIdeal home: a fenced yard because this girl needs to run!\nTraining Needs: Leash walking needs to improve.\nHealth issues: Needs grain free diet for allergies\n\nMeet Naomi\n\nWhoever opens their home to Naomi will have a companion for life. She loves being nearby and, occasionally, on your lap (partially). She gives kisses and sweet love looks. She looks like she is mean mugging all the time but what's behind that adorable face is anything but mean. She's a hazel-eyed beauty with the cutest underbite and brown-blonde brindle and freckles.\n\nIn a matter of weeks, Nay Nay has endeared herself to her foster mom mostly through her impeccable house manners and from the loving trust she readily shows. She listens well and learns quickly. Counter surfing? Barking lots? Getting into trash? Ripping up things? Accidents in the house? Not with this girl. She's well behaved, respectful to people and dogs, loves toys but doesn't destroy them, leaves things alone that aren't hers, and is expert level at house training.\n\nThere are some things you must be prepared for to give Naomi her best life:\n\nTime to wake up. This girl is not an early riser and doesn't like getting out of bed, especially if it's a people bed that's oh so comfy. She pretty much needs some a good petting before she wants to start the day.\nA bathroom companion. She realizes that when you're on the toilet, she has a captive audience. So forget about reading or using your phone. Those hands of yours are meant for petting, so get to it!\nAn invitation to eat. Yep, that's right, she seems to need an invitation to eat from her bowl. She stays off to the side as her meal is prepped and will stay away until she gets the go ahead. Oh, and she is not a big fan of just dry food. Broth, pumpkin, wet food. Just something to take the edge off.\nPermission to get on furniture. She really does love being with you on the couch and even fancies herself a bit of a lap dog at times but she must be asked to join you. She's a good bed buddy. She'll settle in by your feet and barely move throughout the night. No taking over the bed like some other rude dogs I know.\n\nThere are some other specifics we'll be looking at for her forever family. That includes a fenced yard because this girl loves to run. Also, Nay needs to be on a grain free diet. Her former owner said Nay has a grain allergy and sensitive stomach. She's being transitioned back to a grain free food and so far there have been no indications of problems.\n\nLastly, she needs someone who will commit to working with her on her leash walking. She is a puller but she absolutely loves going for a walk. We're working on both enjoying the walk. She's getting better but it's taking time.\n\nOther than a few weeks at her foster home, Naomi has not lived with dogs. She is a bit socially awkward meeting other dogs. She gets so excited she wants to rush in and happily say hello. She's working on toning that down some. She wants to play with other dogs but the resident pups here are playing hard to get. I think she would love to live with another dog, as long as that dog isn't sensitive to her exuberance.\n\nAs for kids, her former owner said Naomi would be fine living with them. Based on my experience with her, I would say older kids would be better because Naomi likes to jump around when she gets excited. She has not jumped on me, but I could see her knocking over smaller kids even though she wouldn't intend to.\n\nI hope that, after reading this, you see what a wonderful dog she is. She will make any one happy. If you think you can offer what she needs to be happy, please apply today.\n\nPLEASE READ: Adopters will not be considered without completing an application. Please visit www.AmericanBulldogRescue.org to apply! Remember - Adoption is always the best option! If you can't help by adopting a homeless pet, please consider making a tax-deductible donation to American Bulldog Rescue, 4 Terry Drive, Suite 1D Newtown, PA 18940 or paypal AmericanBulldogRescue@verizon.net. We cannot place dogs in homes with children under 10 unless that dog has lived with kids or is in a foster home with kids. Thank you.\nTo be considered for adoption, you must apply using our free, online application. Our dogs are fostered in our volunteers' homes, not in a central shelter/location. Only approved applicants are put into contact with the foster family to setup a meeting with the foster dog.

            "description": "This pretty lady is Mama Baker! She is a ~3 year old mixed breed who weighs about 60 pounds.  When she first came to us, she had a belly full of puppies.  They all found their forever homes and Mama Baker is still eager to find her pawfect match!\n\nMama Baker is sweet as pie, but she is also very timid at first. She'll need an adopter who will go slow and be patient with her while she adjusts to her new surroundings - new situations can be scary for a timid gal like her. An experienced dog owner who is willing to work with her on her fear would be ideal.  Once she warms up and realizes she's safe and loved, she will love you unconditionally.  Mama Baker is very gentle and loves to snuggle and lay her head on her person's lap. Keep in mind that her unconditional love can also lead her to be protective of her people.  For this reason, she needs a home with no other dogs.  It will also be necessary for her new family to let her hangout in another room if there are visitors. \n\nMama Baker prefers to hangout with adults and warms up to them much quicker than children, so she kindly requests no kids under the age of 16 in her forever family.  As with any visitor, if you have children that visit or neighborhood kids, Mama Baker would feel much safer and more comfortable if you let her hang out in another room.  A secure fence is a requirement to adopt Mama Baker.\n\nIf you can provide Mama Baker with the home environment she's looking for, apply to adopt today!  Her minimum adoption fee is $235 plus a $12 fee, if 4 months or older, for rabies registration for McLean County residents.\n\nShe has been spayed, microchipped, vaccinated, heartworm checked, dewormed, and is on flea and heartworm preventatives.\n\nFor information about this dog's breed(s), visit: http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/abc.htm \n\nTo fill out our adoption application, go to: http://fs16.formsite.com/WishBoneCanineRescue/adoptionapplication/index.html",
