This boy is a spitfire full of energy and one happy, playful puppy!\n\nAustin Powers (AP for short) is a gorgeous, affectionate American Bulldog mix who is one year old, weighs 40 lbs, and is looking for his loving, forever family!  He is eager to please and knows basic commands. He has had professional training and is very food motivated.  He is an extremely athletic and dog friendly dog! He loves people so much that he \"talks\" to them!  A home with children over 15 or an adult only home would be best since he is still a puppy and needs someone who will continue to train him. His playful energy & exuberance could easily knock over a young child.  Austin is looking for a home with a fenced yard & someone who is very active (maybe a jogger) since he has enough energy to think that a 3 mile jog is the warmup!  He would also do very will attending doggy day care once or twice a week, especially if his people work outside the home.  He loves to make friends with other dogs and would be great with a family that already has a dog that loves to play!  Austin loves his crate and is crate trained, housebroken, neutered, fully vaccinated & microchipped. \n\nFor more information about AP, please email us at info@barkvilledogrescue.org. If you would like to adopt sweet Austin, please submit an application for him at https://www.barkvilledogrescue.org/applications",

He is a big velvety hunk who is looking for his new home.\n\nRocky\u2019s family is surrendering him because they can\u2019t adequately care for him anymore. \n\nThis boy knows basic commands, is house broken, and absolutely loves to be with people! Rocky does not enjoy the company of cats, so absolutely no feline friends for him. Rocky can be iffy with other dogs, but with proper introductions and patience he actually does well.\n\nPrior to intake a training evaluation was done which we will absolutely share with any potential adopters. The trainer has also offered three free sessions to ensure Rocky is set up for success.\n\nSo, if you have a home with a lot of love to give, can give Rocky the training he needs, and will have patience and allow him to decompress when he arrives, then please visit our website to fill out an application!\n\nWww.safewithusanimalrescue.org",

Paisley is looking for an active owner who will take her for daily walks and help her stay mentally and physically challenged. Paisley is a goofy, smart dog who grew up on the streets in Houston, Texas but came here to Iowa to find her forever family. She just got her dog DNA back for her Christmas gift and found out that while we already knew she is 100% a great dog, she is made up of 36% American Staffordshire Terrier, 25% American Bulldog, 13% Rottweiler, 12% Boxer, 9% German Shepherd, and 5% Labrador Retriever. Paisley loves everything and everyone and has a zest for play and life in general. Because she's extremely playful and smart she would do best with other pets and humans with similar play styles as she might be overwhelming to really young children or elderly pets. She gets along well with the kids, dogs, and cat in her current foster home. If a future owner has a fence, Paisley needs it to be a tall privacy fence and very secure as Paisley can jump really high, climb chain link, and open latches. Because of her love of fence climbing, Paisley would also be happy to have an owner without a fence who is 100% committed to leashed potty breaks and daily walks or runs.\n\nPaisley Blue's adoption fee is $250 and includes her spay, microchip, current vaccinations and preventatives PLUS a free obedience course at Cedar Run Pet Boarding & Daycare in Hiawatha. Last Hope requires that all animals be kept as indoor pets only, be altered and current on vaccinations and preventatives. Our adoption process includes reference and background checks, a vet check and a home visit. Please apply at Adopthope.org for consideration.",

Her foster family is working on her manners when greeting new people.\n\nDixie will require a high fence as we were told by her previous owner that she can jump fences. Dixie is up to date on vaccines,  microchipped, heartworm negative, and has been started on a monthly flea and heartworm preventative..\n\nDixie's adoption fee is $200.00.   Animal Friends Society is a small 501(c)(3) group that uses adoption fees to care for the current and future fosters in our care and to continue our mission of spaying and neutering.\n\nFor more information on Dixie, or to fill out an application, please visit animalfriendssociety@hotmail.com.",

Momo was rescued from a living situation that was very challenging.  This sweetheart is going to need an understanding, patient, and dog- experienced owner who will continue to guide her as she fully blossoms to be the best girl she can be!   She is very smart, is an eager learner, and has already mastered several cues.  She loves to play, play, play, and she adores her toys!  Due to her high energy and playful spirit, she will need a home that has solid wood or chain link fence.  She walks loosely on a leash but will pull if she wants to follow her nose. This terrific girl is looking for a quiet, yet active adult-only home, without a lot of traffic in and out.  She is on daily medication that she happily gobbles down in her \u201cmeatball\u201d of wet dog food.  She is looking for a lifetime commitment and the shelter will require at least two meetings with her new family to ensure this is the best fit for everyone.  No children, dogs, cats, or any other pets in the home, please!\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adoption, please fill out our online adoption survey at http://olddogsnewdigs.com/form-adoption.html.\n\nPlease share so that we can help find Momo her new family!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "description": "Pepper is a Lab/Pit mix, born July 2016. She came into rescue with her puppies, and they have all been adopted. She is doing amazing now without her puppies and is such a sweet, sweet girl. She does well with other dogs her size, but has not been around larger or smaller dogs. She needs a home without cats She does well with children, but she is too big and excitable for smaller kids. Her tail is a whip! Her heartworm treatment is done, and she has taken it like a champ. Some of Pepper's hobbies include looking out the window for hours, snuggling, helping herself to her bag of dog food, and hogging the bed or couch. Pepper is very athletic and can jump over a 4-foot fence with ease. Her new home must have a 6-foot fence.\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Pepper is $350. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

            "description": "Finley is 3 years old and about 45 pounds. She is a mixed breed. \nFinley came to us a very fearful puppy.  We have done a ton of work with her,  but she is afraid of almost everything.  She is jumpy at loud noises, like if you drop something.  \nShe is ok with us, but even after years of trying, she is still very afraid of strangers.  \nFinley is a big barker.  She barks at the neighbors, she barks anytime she is afraid of something. \nThe time she is most at ease is when she is playing with the other dogs. \nI know it is a stretch that she will find the right home, but maybe one is out there. \nHer home will need :\nA fenced in yard, as she is a runner. If she ever gets out, I am not sure you would ever catch her. Also, she likes to play fetch, and needs a yard for that.\nAt least one other dog in her home \nA quiet, rural setting\nA quiet home with no small children\nAnd a super patient,  loving person that understands it will take a LOT to win her over.\nShe will need to be adopted locally as you will have to come several times to spend time with her before she goes to her new home. She will run and hide when anyone comes to visit.   She will not just decide she is not afraid of you. She will be a lot work, but she is a sweet girl. \nShe can't be boarded if you go on vacation,  so she will need a dogsitter that will take the time to get to know her.\n\nThese are non negotiable,  as we want a successful adoption for her so that she won't be returned.  That would awful for her.\n\nFinley is spayed and up to date on vaccinations.  Her adoption fee is $350.00\nIf you think you might be willing to give her a permanent,  loving home,  the first step is a completed application.  You can find them here\nwww.newdigsfordogsrescue.org",

My previous family moved out of our house and somehow forgot to take me with them, but a nice neighbor ensured that I wasn't left to fend for myself and found help from TBC. I love people but prefer to be the only dog unless we schedule a meet and greet . I like it when the \"\"crew\"\" takes me out for a walk. I'm very chill and would love to be your best friend. Just fill out the super easy pre-adoption app and come meet me soon!! I can't wait to meet you. xoxo Dottie\n\nTo adopt Dottie into your family, please complete our pre-adoption application at this link: https://bit.ly/2CCVFPV\n\n#AdoptDontShop #TBCAnimalRescue #RescueDogs\nIf you would like to adopt this sweet furbaby, please complete our pre-qualification application at this link: https://bit.ly/2CCVFPV\n\n#AdoptDontShop #TBCAnimalRescue",

            "description": "This is Thor. He's a large (100 pounds +) Yellow Labrador, just over two years old, and recently became a Lucky Paws Rescue dog. When Thor was a puppy, it was suggested that he had cateracts in his eyes. No further diagnostics or treatment was done, which led to glaucoma, and Thor is now blind. He will need to have both eyes removed, as they can be very painful (which is now being managed).\n\nWe have Thor in a wonderful, loving foster home with people who adopted a blind dog from Lucky Paws Rescue a few years ago. Our plan was to have Thor stay in this foster home until his surgery and through recovery.\n\nAfter discussing with the foster, the best scenerio would be if we could find Thor his forever home now, and then move forward with the surgery after he acclimates. Lucky Paws Rescue will be taking care of the surgery costs.\n\nIn his previous home, where Thor had lived all his life, he was friendly with other dogs, cats, and people--but that was the only home he'd known, where he felt secure, and the home where he'd gone blind over time. Moving from his home to an unfamiliar place with new people, new dogs, and a new floorplan proved to be scary for Thor, and of course, being blind only intensifies everything.\n\nThe foster home has two other dogs. Being blind, he needed security in his new territory, so he quickly attached himself to his foster mom. He isn't fond of the other dogs, and even though they are friendly, Thor does not want them near him. It would be ideal to find a home without any other dogs.\n\nHe's a very sweet boy. We're looking for a loving, patient home for him that could accomodate his needs. Thor is very young, can adapt, and have a long and happy life!\n\nIf you think you might the one for this big sweetheart, please fill our application by copy/pasting this link into your browser: http://form.jotform.us/form/50488470409157",

            "description": "Meet Frieda!! She is an approximately 1-year-old medium to high energy Shepherd mix. She became a misfit due to demodectic mange but she is all healed up now! She is heart worm negative, up to date on age appropriate vaccinations, spayed, and micro-chipped. \n\nFrieda walks on a leash pretty well and does well in the car, too. She hasn't quite figured out how to sit / lay so she can easily keep her balance but she doesn't get sick and she behaves well. She is just not extremely sturdy. She has not learned any tricks while with her foster family, but she would likely learn fast with the right owner. \n\nShe is great with other dogs and good with older children. She could be okay with younger children but would need to be monitored in case she were to **accidentally** knock them down. She REALLY wants to play with her feline foster siblings, to the point that she will chase them up their cat tree if she isn't closely monitored. Her foster family has a lot of cats around and we have no concerns that she would ever intentionally hurt them but we do worry that her trying to be their friend could result in someone being injured. We would like to see her go to a home with no cats or other small pets she would have ready access to. \n\nFrieda is a little slow to warm up in a new environment. We suspect she came from a not-so-great background, though we will never really \"know.\" Once she warms up to her humans, she is the sweetest, goofiest girl! She is always climbing in \"her\" chair and sticking her tongue out when she knows it is time to go to bed. She loves to run and play with other dogs and would more than likely be great for someone who likes to hike or jog regularly (with some training... her leash skills aren't *that* good). She prefers women, so would do best in a home with a single woman or a couple, not a home where she would only be exposed to a man / men 24/7\n\nYou can apply to meet / adopt her at www.muttmisfits.com/adoption-application",

            "description": "Here's Newman!  Newman is an 8 year old Labrador Retriever Mix.  While we don't know much about his past, we can only assume that this sweet boy was left to his own devices way too often, which is why he gets nervous when left alone.  Newman is very sweet and easily attaches to \"his\" human, but he doesn't like to share his people, so he must be the only pet in his adoptive home.  Newman pulls on a leash, and at 75 pounds, can be a bit much to take for a long stroll, so he will require a fenced in yard so that he can run around and tire himself out!  Newman loves to sit on the couch and watch television with his people - he's the perfect quarantine buddy!  If he sounds like a fit for you - apply today!  His adoption fee is $150!\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

I am currently fostering this angel of a pup, Hannibal & he still needs a forever home!! \nHe\u2019s the kindest, most lovable pup I\u2019ve ever spent time with & will cuddle all day long. He loves his bone covered in peanut butter & never gets bored of his new toy!!\nHe did have trauma as a puppy that makes it hard to use his jaw. He\u2019s taking medication for it & will need occasional vet visits - but so far he\u2019s been nothing but a blessing to me!\u201d\nHannibal had some kind of traumatic injury to his head at some point. He is blind in one eye, in addition to not being able to open his jaw. We are currently working closely with a veterinarian to decide if Hannibal being unable to open his jaw is due to scar tissue or an autoimmune disease. He is doing well though and with your help we can give this beautiful guy a second chance. Please email awfpadoptions@gmail.com if interested in adopting!\n***\nPlease read through our adoption policies and requirements at www.awfpva.org/adoptions or on our Petfinder homepage prior to requesting an application. \n\nAll of our animals are in foster homes. We will schedule meet and greets after approving your adoption application to ensure our fosters are only meeting with serious applicants. Please allow 1-2 weeks for approval as AWFP is run by volunteers who are full-time veterinary students.",

Mickey weighs about 55 pounds, and is UTD on vaccinations, HW negative, and neutered. \nMickey is full of energy, loves people, and is very snuggly! He's like your shadow, always wants to be with you. He loves to go for walks and hang outside with his people but can also be a major couch potato. \nMickey needs to be the only dog/pet in the home. It would also be best if he were in a home with children 10+. \nMickey knows no strangers! He does enjoy his chill time and children that can respect his space at those times would be ideal. His favorite thing to do is curl up and snuggle for bed. \nMickey\u2019s ideal home is with a home owner and a fenced in yard. \nMickey received special training with K9 Focus Academy, and his adoption fee includes a lifetime of private lessons and 5 years of group classes that is transferable to his new owner! \n\nHome visit and vet regencies required! \n\nTo apply to meet/adopt Mickey, please send us an inquiry so we can email you an application! \n\n",

He was anemic and emaciated. He's now showing his stunning physique as he is a remarkable pit bull terrier mix. He's estimated to be about a year and a half old and is good with people of all ages. He is strong and needs an experienced loving forever home with a fenced in yard to run and play in. We at Rescue Dogs Rock NYC heard the plea for Larry and he was immediately taken to our veterinary partner where he received the medical care he required. Larry is now in a loving foster home where he gets along with everyone--but wants a home to call his own. Larry is described as a total snuggle bug! Larry needs a safe, happy, loving home to crash in . . . forever! If Larry can crash at your home for the rest of his life, please apply online to adopt Larry at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

He is the sweetest most loyal little guy there is, and he is always right by their side! Goliath does well with everyone in the home, including his 1 year old puppy brother, 2 year old puppy sister, 4 year old human brother, and he loves both of his foster parents! He has no problem playing rough with the big dogs, but also knows how to mellow out and hang with his people! This little guy loves belly rubs, walks, and hoarding all of the stuffed animals on his bed! He learned sit, lay down, and roll over within 10 minutes! Absolutely perfect little guy, that is just finally seeing how good life should be! Goliath is a scruffy Terrier mix, weighs 30 lbs (but growing!) and was born approximately 01-29-20. He is neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, given flea/tick preventive, dewormed & started on heartworm preventive. Adoption fee is $575 to help offset the many expenses we have for vetting costs. We rely strictly on adoption fees and donations to continue to save the lives of orphaned & abandoned pets; 100% goes towards their care. If interested in adopting one of our available dogs or puppies, please complete an online adoption application at https://dollyoldapps.wpengine.com/adopt/ You will be contacted by our adoption coordinator via email after your application has been reviewed & approved to schedule an appointment.",

Chewy is still getting the hang of life at the sanctuary but he is very smart and eager to work on his manners. He can get overstimulated easily and can get jumpy when he is excited. He has been working hard on this through a training plan and has made lots of progress. Chewy has met multiple dogs at the sanctuary and is very playful and bouncy upon meeting them. Due to some resource guarding, Chewy might do best as an only dog in the home with dog pals to hang out with outside of the home. When Chewy is calm and relaxed, he loves getting cuddles and pets from his people. He is also slowly becoming and agility rock star and loves learning new obstacles. If you want an enthusiastic dog and that wants to learn and has plenty of room to grow, Chewy could be the dog for you.",

He is completely unaware of the dangers of vehicles and roadways.\n\nThe ideal home for Miles will be 1 or 2 adults and NO CHILDREN.  Very structured home life with him being the ONLY pet with endless FUN training.\n\nHis adoption plan requires several meetings with Miles and our Canine Program Manager.

It sometimes takes me a few times of seeing you to get to know you and trust you, so I would love it if you came to meet me a few times before adopting me. I also prefer women over men, would prefer to be an only pet, and cannot go home with kids. I will also need a home with experienced owners that can provide me with structure and routine.

            "description": "Sable #6230 is a 3-year-old female, Pit Bull mix. She is a sweet girl, but a bit shy. She is very friendly when meeting people. Sable is very submissive toward other dogs; she will need slow introductions to furry friends. She may do best as an only dog- no small dogs.   She is house and crate trained. She walks well on a leash. she is an active energetic gal who loves playing fetch- a big fenced in yard would be a plus.  She is funny and playful. Sable  also loves snuggling on the couch with her people. She is great with her foster family's 10 and 16 year-old human kids. Her greatest asset is her loving disposition. She weighs 40 pounds and is full grown. This pup is microchipped. We believe you can always teach an \u2018old\u2019 dog new tricks, so we highly recommend continued obedience training for this smart pup; it stimulates the dog's mind and establishes a good dog/adopter relationship. This pup, like all pups, should be on heartworm preventative; an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. If you are interested in adopting this dog, and are already approved to adopt through our organization, please contact dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with the pup\u2019s name and ID number in the subject line. OTHERWISE, please submit an adoption application online: http://www.lastchanceanimalrescue.org/adoptus.html E-mail dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with questions.

            "description": "Meet Prince! \n\nSENIOR LOVERS!...Meet Prince & Lady! They were pulled from a rural southern shelter in July after their owners surrendered them because they were moving. They are a bonded pair who always look after each other. They eat together, they walk together, and they chill together. They are very relaxed and well behaved.  They just need a quiet retirement home to live out their golden years. Their ideal home is one with no cats and no little kids. November is adopt a senior month so why not adopt this beautiful Shepard duo who are still looking for their FURever home?\n\nInterested in meeting Prince? \n\nAll Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue dogs are in homes with foster families; we do not have a shelter where dogs are available for daily viewing.\n\nOur process is as follows:\n1.  Review our policies and adoption radius  on our website: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n2.  Submit an application for review and approval;\n3.  MPM Rescue reviews application and checks vet records and references;\n4.  MPM foster contacts approved applicant(s) to arrange a home check and meeting with available dog(s);\n5.   If there is a good fit, adoption is completed with a contract and fees (payable via check or cash).\n\nThe adoption fee is listed here: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n\nDogs from Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue come with the following medical care already provided:\n- Spay/Neuter surgery\n- Age appropriate vaccinations\n- Heartworm test (for dogs over 6mo) and treatment if positive\n- Microchip\n- Deworming\n- Heartworm and Flea/Tick Preventative\n- Any other necessary medical treatment as recommended by veterinarian\n\n*Please note that the identified breed(s) are best guesses. We very rarely have information on our dogs' actual breeds since they often come to the shelters we work with as strays.*",

She will make you laugh when her lip gets stuck on her teeth.\u00a0 Sage is heartworm negative, has current vaccinations, and is spayed. \u00a0Her adoption fee is $195. \u00a0An additional $20 is for Avid microchip and registration.",

I may be classified as a senior, but you wouldn't know that once you start playing with me.\n\nI love being with my foster parents and will follow them everywhere they go. My favorite is when we are sitting on the couch and they give me ear scratches for hours. I love playing with my toys and there is no such thing as too many. I'm a big silly goof that loves being a part of the party anywhere in the house. My favorite part of the day is when my family is home together and we can Netflix and chill. When my people aren't home, I'm free to roam but I prefer to just sleep on the couch, waiting for their return. I am working on my training and have mastered sit and down and am fully potty trained. I am working on walking on a leash still so a home with a yard would be amazing so I can run around. \n\nIf you're looking for a new couch snuggle partner, I'm your guy!! Head over to http://www.aliverescue.org/adoptio-application and fill out an application today!\n\nBrent's estimated birthdate: 07/09/2013\nBrent's approximate weight: 60 lbs.",

I have visited the Veterinarian where I have received some treatments, and have been very well cared for! I do have Cushings so I need a family who will ensure I continue with my medication. I am beautifully house-trained, and I loooooove people, in fact I am known as my foster mom's, shadow and I am an excellent companion. I do require a home with no other pets, secure fenced yard and I am not compatible with a doggie door. I am not destructive within the home, so I am ok to roam inside while you are away. I do love going to the office with my foster mom, and I am happy to catch a nap curled up under her desk while she is busy, but I am ready to run and play at a moment's notice! My favorite things to do daily are play ball, chew on my Himalayan Dog Chew, explore in the fenced yard and yes....I love treats! I am a joyful, loving gal looking for my forever home! I am on medications due to my Cushings that cost $70 a month with and blood tests approximately every 6 months that cost $350. My adoption fee is $75 but if you are a senior human over the age of 65 years, my adoption fee is waived! MUST BE AN ONLY DOG AND NO YOUNG CHILDREN.If you are interested in any of our Boston Terriers or would like to be eligible to adopt a Boston Terrier through our rescue in the future, please fill out an application.

            "description": "Ludo is a lover boy! He is very mild mannered and perfectly content to be asleep on his bed for most of the day as long as he has a soft bed and a cozy blanket.  If there are other dogs around his yard (beyond the fence), he will bark/challenge them with his barking like any other dog.  He loves to be held, to sleep on a lap, or in the bed with you. Due to his disabilities, he is pretty reserved and hesitant to be mobile and inquisitive.  Ludo does not mind other dogs or cats.  He will call/cry out when he is lost (in the yard) or scared.\n\nWhen Ludo wakes up from sleeping, he needs to use the bathroom right away. If left for more than 4 (best case) - 6 (absolute max) hours, he will have an accident. Because Ludo is hesitant and cannot get outside quickly by himself, he needs to be carried outside to do his business.  If he is not taken outside, he will go wherever he is (on the carpet, floor, blankets, etc).  Despite being exposed to potty pads, Ludo has never used one.\n\nBecause Ludo does not see, he relies highly on his sense of smell and sound to navigate his environment. He does best in a quiet, low key environment, and an environment that is free of clutter (i.e., no small toys or items that could cause him to trip and fall). Ludo should not be in a house with stairs or a house with a pool.  A house with young children may be stressful to him.\n\nLudo is entirely dependent on his humans to have his needs met.  He gets excited about meal time and snacks.  He WILL steal food from others (cats or dogs) if he has the opportunity.  Ludo gets excited and barks at a knock on the door if the other dogs are also barking.  Ludo needs a home that will be patient with him and understand his disabilities.  He needs a home that has several soft beds for him to rest.\n",

Ludo also has a very sensitive gastrointestinal tract and eats a specific diet. Small changes to his diet can cause major GI upset.  He has a tendency towards an infection around his penis.  He should be frequently monitored for discharge, but will often display signs of infection by whimpering or licking the area.\n\nOccasional accidents - Ludo does well with his potty habits most of the time if they are managed by a human. He sleeps most of the day, so whenever he gets up, it is a sign that he needs to go out. His maximum time without a potty break is about 4 hours. He does have multiple bowel movements throughout the day and these are usually done at the same time he goes out.  Ludo does routinely wake up in the night and need to go to the bathroom.  He does not indicate the need to go out, but if taken outside as soon as he wakes, he will not have an accident.\n\n \n\n",

He is a quick learner and has quickly gotten used to the house rules (his foster parents dont want him counter surfing for some reason!), loves pets, and likes to hang out wherever his foster family is.\n\nHe loves to race round and round the yard with their other foster dog, and can do some howling when hes found a scent (somehow the rabbits always get away!). He loves to play with other dogs, take walks and have doggy play dates.\n\nHis dream is to adopt a family that can provide lots of love, exercise & attention and he will provide lots of love in return!\n\nPAW places animals in the Washington DC Metropolitan area only.",

She is  a  very friendly gal  and  warms  up to everyone very quickly.  She  is crate trained  and will jut  need a little help with  house training  because  she has not  been  in a  foster home.   She has been spayed, has her shots  and  is microchipped.  She is  ready  for a home!  She  doesn't  want to  wait any longer.  She is  ready  to bring some  real joy  to a special  person.

Sir Billingsley  is a doll  but  he  has  a habit of nipping.  That  unfortunately is correct.  If  you try to pick him up he nips!  Now  maybe once in a home  with the person he  trusts  and feeling  fully confident in his surroundings  this  behavior  may diminish,  Professional  training  would  also  be  suggested.  We  know  with the right person Billingsley will put his  best foot  forward.  We  give him  credit  for being intelligent  and observant.  He  is  a leader in his  pack.  We can  not vouch 100% on his house training skills, He  needs  to be in an all adult  home , no children please.  His  adoption fee of $200  includes  neuter, shots and a microchip,  It  also helps  us to keep our work moving forward to save more dogs.\nAll applications ubmitted  for  Billingsley  will  be  given thorough team review and consideration due  to his nip habit",

Molly's favorite playmate is Penny her sister who is also available for adoption. Molly has an identical sister who is a bit bigger than she is.\nAs of today, July 27, Molly is 10 weeks old and will be available to go to her new home on August 3 because she needs to be dewormed again. You are invited to meet her before that time though. We live right down the street from SeaWorld.\nMolly does enjoy playing with toys and tug of war with her siblings. Even though she can run up and down the stairs, she hangs back when it is time to go potty because she wants me to carry her and I do.\nCome and meet her. Application and adoption fee required.\nTransportation out of state is available.\nADOPTION FEE & APPLICATION REQUIRED\n\nRoxy's K-9 Rescue does not have a shelter, all of our dogs are raised in foster homes. Each dog comes spay/neutered (fixed), rabies shots appropriate for their age, and dewormed twice. The dogs are up to date on vaccinations according to their age at the time of adoption. They are microchipped, heartworm tested and on monthly flea/tick and heartworm preventative. ALL OF THIS IS INCLUDED IN THE ADOPTION FEE.\nMedical records will come with each dog at the time of adoption.\nOur organization is run by volunteers/foster parents, please be patient to give us time to respond to your emails and/or phone calls. We will reply to you. Thank you.",

He was a stray living in the woods, scrounging for food near the garbage cans. It took some time but they were able to trap him. Charlie Brown is a sweet, affectionate dog. Who loves people. He prefers the company of female dogs so NO homes with other males. NO cats. \nHe is good with kids but due to his size and lack of training he would be better with kids 10 years or older.

            "description": "Little Ann is a 1 yr old spaniel/terrier mix. She weighs about 35 lbs. We estimate she will be 35-45 lbs  at most. \nShe is very timid at 1st, and it takes her a while to warm up to new dogs and people. She is sweet, smart, and has a great disposition. She is completely potty trained, knows how to use a doggie door, knows come, no, uhuh, outside, and go potty commands. She is loves to chew on benebones, nylabones, bully sticks, and toys.\n\nShe was found dumped out in the country, with her brother Big Dan. We do not know how long they were on their own. I am sure they were ran off by numerous people, maybe attacked by coyotes and possibly other dogs before they found a good Samaritan who took them in and got them to our rescue.\n\nShe really loves belly rubs, wading in the kiddie pool, playing with toys, her brother, and our adult female dogs. She is crazy about pop corn, and bacon, and likes treats of all kinds. \n\nShe will need basic training, confidence building, leash training, and continued socialization. She does not like to be crated, but does fine in her pen or a gated room.\n\nShe will do best in a home with a gentle, secure, but playful canine sibling(s) or as the only dog. A quieter home, with older or no kids, a nice securely fenced yard, and someone who is home most of the time, would be ideal.\n\nHer family would need to be able and willing to allow her the time, patience, love, socialization, and confidence/positive reinforcement training she will need to become the great companion she is meant to be.\n\nALL children should be at least AGE 5 to be approved for adoption!\n\nPlease apply directly at WWW.BIGDOGRESCUEPROJECT.ORG/Adopt.\n\nOur adoption fee of $450 includes  age appropriate vaccinations, microchipping and transport expenses.\n\nApplication will be accepted and an adopter chosen based on the needs of the dog.  We will contact you if you are chosen to adopt.",

Rescues had come in and picked all the youngsters and left me and my ol' lady friend all by our selves on the street. Finally after alot of networking a rescue heard we were still there and came to get us. I hopped right in her car but my friend she had to get fancy and corner in someones yard! I was so friendly I was trying to help her get my buddy the whole time! Didn't she know good people when she saw one???\n\nI had called shotgun in the car and was immediately her best bud. I kept popping her hand off the shift to stick my head under it so she could pet me better. I'm very considerate that way and still do that whenever I'm sitting next to someone and I think they've forgotten how to pet me. They got me neutered, up to date on shots, current on heartworm/flea prevention and microchipped. Unfortunately after a long time of being on the street with no one to take care of me I was heartworm positive but I have already been through treatment and am on the mend!\n\nI really love all people. Little ones, Big ones, tall ones and short ones it doesn't make any difference to me! I would love a home with just about anyone who would show me affection whether they've got kids or grandkids running around. I'm a little bit older boy so I don't need quite as much action as some of those young bucks out there but I still like to go for a walk down the road with my foster mom and I get super excited when I see people! I would probably do best in a home as an only dog or maybe just with a submissive female. Male dogs rile me up to much and after being on the street for so long I don't know what to expect from them! But my foster mom is still working with me all the time to make me the best boy I can be!\n\nI am still located in Houston, Texas but am super excited to find my forever home and get transported to your area! Will you be my family? For more info on me please email Stephanie at nicole.whar94@yahoo.com.",

Rescues had come in and picked all the youngsters and left me and my ol' lady friend all by our selves on the street. Finally after alot of networking a rescue heard we were still there and came to get us. I hopped right in her car but my friend she had to get fancy and corner in someones yard! I was so friendly I was trying to help her get my buddy the whole time! Didn't she know good people when she saw one???\n\nI had called shotgun in the car and was immediately her best bud. I kept popping her hand off the shift to stick my head under it so she could pet me better. I'm very considerate that way and still do that whenever I'm sitting next to someone and I think they've forgotten how to pet me. They got me neutered, up to date on shots, current on heartworm/flea prevention and microchipped. Unfortunately after a long time of being on the street with no one to take care of me I was heartworm positive but I have already been through treatment and am on the mend!\n\nI really love all people. Little ones, Big ones, tall ones and short ones it doesn't make any difference to me! I would love a home with just about anyone who would show me affection whether they've got kids or grandkids running around. I'm a little bit older boy so I don't need quite as much action as some of those young bucks out there but I still like to go for a walk down the road with my foster mom and I get super excited when I see people!

She prefers for the other dogs not to come near her.  Especially when you want to pet her.  She will not hesitate to growl at them and try to back them up from invading her space.    We feel she would not do good with young kids.  Mercedes repeats these lyrics to all the other dogs in her yard.   She is estimated to be about 6 years old \n\nYou know Madonna ain't got nothin' on me\nB-B-B-Beyonce ain't got nothin' on me\nC-C-C-Christina ain't got nothin' on me\nDiva what? Diva who? Diva where?

That's me!\nYou know it's all about me\nI'm a specialty\nYou know it's all about me\n\n\nAdoption fee for this dog will be $150.00, which helps with the expenses for spaying or neutering your pet, all vaccinations, including rabies up to date, microchip, and any other grooming or medical care that was needed when the dog was rescued by ARF.     \nDue to the high demand for puppies/dogs we anticipate multiple applications on any of our dogs/puppies. We will review each submitted application, then contact the approved adopter via email. If that particular person has changed their mind we will move to the next approved adopter.

When he arrived for his photo session, Pele\u2019 hopped into the doggie pool for a 5 second refresher and then dashed to the other end of the bark park, and spent the next 15 minutes in an amazing non-stop display of agile athletic prowess that left the spectators breathless. His most prized possession is the oversized blue \u201csoccer\u201d ball that he brings alive with his non-stop, jaw-dropping moves that any two-legged competitor would be proud to emulate. Pele\u2019 is the maestro of the Step Over, the Cruyff, the Cut, the Body Feint and the Scoop Turn.  Out of all the moves, his favorite is the Header, of which he is a true master.  Pele\u2019 does an instant sit on request and takes treats with respect and gentleness. He pulls with exuberance on leash but has a caring HS volunteer working with him to moderate his energetic walk. Pele\u2019s favorite dream is to be picked as a mascot for the LA GALAXY where he can perform his magic in front of 40,000 fans (all wearing masks, of course).  Pele\u2019 has a high intelligence IQ that will require a human of similar presence to appreciate and fulfill the promise of sharing life with an astoundingly gifted canine.",

            "description": "Born May 5, 2019, Enzo is a male American Stafford Terrier mix seeking a forever home. Here is a little bit about him: Enzo is a medium to large pup that came into the rescue following a car accident that left him with an amputation and a broken pelvis. He recently turned one year old and is very sweet, affectionate and playful. Enzo is crate trained, potty trained, knows sit, down, kennel, and \"out\" (of the kitchen during meal prep, eating). He plays very well with his canine foster sister and 2 foster cats. He loves chew toys, antlers and car rides. We are working on walking nicely on leash. He corrects easily, so in no time, he should be heeling. Enzo requires a 6 foot fenced yard and would love to live with an active person or family. He has done great around young children, but he doesn't know his own strength and might accidentally knock a small one over. Enzo's best fit forever home will be with adults or adults and children over 8. He is vetted, microchipped and his pelvis has fully healed. He will make a wonderful companion for some lucky person or family! Applications: www.mikeyschance.com\n\nAll large and/or active dogs will require a full fenced (6ft) secure yard. \nNo children under 5. \n\nLike all Mikey's Chance dogs, this dog will come to you from a foster home that has provided loving one-on-one attention, socialization and some basic training, as well as quality food and exercise. \n\nApplications can be found at www.mikeyschance.com and completed on a computer, tablet, and/or phone. Please note that adopters are not chosen on a first come, first served basis, but full consideration is given to the best fit for the dog AND the adopter. Applications can take up to 3 weeks to process. Application submission DO NOT guarantee approval for adoption.",

Don't let his age fool you because his energy level will surprise YOU !  He would be a great jogging partner if that is something you like to do routinely; he is still learning to walk at \"normal\" pace.  He is a bit of a speed walker... so anyone that roller blades or jogs or walks at a brisk pace can keep up with him.  He needs a large fenced yard, playtime and exercise routinely because.....we all know \"A TIRED dog is a GOOD dog\"   Deak enjoys tug of war with his rope toy or a kong ball, and his personal (kiddie) pool is much loved (during the summer); if there's a creek or rain puddle he will find it and partake !  Need a kiddie pool for Deak? It comes with his adoption :-)  Deak thrives on playing, exercise, eating and human companionship. His daily routine is time outside watching birds, chasing squirrels or rabbits (he has a strong prey drive so \"nose work\" is something you will see often from him), playtime throughout the day, nap time, sometimes a car ride , AND just hanging with his human companions wherever they are inside or outside.  He will greet his humans with toys or kisses, and he tries to be a LAP dog, so be prepared for this boy's intense level of affection   Adults are the BEST FIT for this boy with no other pets in the home. Deacon is very smart and has done very well with his training; he knows basic commands necessary to help manage his behavior, and would do best with someone dedicated to providing leadership, on-going training, exercise, playtime, and companionship. \nHis ADOPTION APPLICATION is on the ADOPTME page at Dream4pets.org\t\nWe usually adopt within a 120 mile radius of Miami County (Troy, Piqua, TippCity)   His adoption application is on the ADOPTME page at Dream4pets.org       If you have questions,Email PetsRRpassion@gmail.com",

            "description": "Levi was among a number of dogs that a neighboring area's animal control forcibly removed from their former home. We're not sure why the AC removed Levi and the other dogs but are aware that, despite a court order prohibiting them from doing so, the former owners attempted to re-gain custody of the dogs through some sneaky and underhanded methods. Each time the former owners were caught and prohibited from obtaining any of the dogs. SoCo Rescue was asked to find Levi and his buddy (see Bones' profile) new homes. Both Levi and Bones were placed in a safe foster home once we removed them from the AC facility.\n\nWhile Levi's appearance and size may concern some people, in truth he's just a big mush! He's impressed his foster parents with his super-friendly personality towards people and other dogs alike and has proven to be very smart and a quick learner. While at his foster home, Levi has interacted very well with the children at the house. He also seems to be more attached to women than he does men.\n\nLevi has now been fully vetted and recently tested negative for heartworms. He's up to date on all of his yearly vaccinations and monthly preventatives as well. He may need additional house training\n\nIf you're looking for a large dog companion that's friendly and very personable, then submit an application for Levi at socorescue.com",

            "description": "I was surrendered to the city shelter with my mother by our first owner.  I don\u2019t know why but I knew I had to protect my mom in that scary place.  Luckily, we were saved by two volunteers who ignored my behavior understanding the reason.   A foster mom stepped up to take us both in.  My mom got adopted quickly and I do miss her but I know my foster mom found a great family for her.    I am a bit more of a challenge but my foster mom says I have improved so much.   I like to think my foster mom is not in a rush and wants to find me the perfect home.  \n\nI am fully vetted, neutered, micro-chipped and up to date on my vaccinations.  I have to admit, I am not thrilled going to the vet so not the best patient.  I am always happy to leave!!  It is good I am a healthy pup of about three years of age.  I am a terrier of some sort, perhaps Rat or Jack Russell with some Chihuahua?  I have the cutest bobbed tail.  I weigh in at 16 pounds.  I love my food so need my weight watched.  \n\nI am good in the car but will bark at people and dogs that walk by.  My foster mom discourages that.  I love my walks, sitting on my foster mom\u2019s lap and being with other dogs.  I do not really play but as you can see from the pictures, we enjoy sleeping on the bed together.   I do have lots of energy and sometimes get the zoomies which includes jumping on my foster mom\u2019s lap, then pushing myself off to circle the yard some more.   But I also calm down and retreat to my crate.\n\nI am slow to warm up to people so it\u2019s best to let me make the first move.    But once I like someone, we are the best of friends.  I have not been around children they do make me a bit nervous when out walking.  I would do best in an all adult home especially a single person.

There's a treatment that is not as hard on the dog as the one you may have heard of and it's FREE.\n\nWe answer all emails back within 48 hours. Please watch your spam folders as an application will be attached and this sometimes places it in there. \n\nHIS/HER adoption fee is $550 USD and that will pay for TRANSPORT, all his/her shots up to date, neutered/spayed, microchip and rabies.\n\nPlease e-mail MuttsAndMeows@Mail.com for an adoption application. \n\nThis dog is currently in the Houston Texas area.  Once the application is approved and adoption fee paid, transport will be arranged.\n\nBecause this adoption will be without meeting the dog first, we will need to try to be extra careful that everyone (including you) think this will be a good fit.  We will try to give you as much information about the dog as we can.  Unfortunately, many are fresh from the shelter and we don't know much about them yet. \n\nLike us on Facebook - search Mutts & Meows - and help even more pets find loving homes.",

            "description": "Beca is a 24 months old, female, fully vetted, current on shots, spayed Schnauzer Mix who came to us from Puerto Rico. She is ready to provide tons of love. Becca requires an experienced adopter as she is initially very shy. She relates well with other dogs and enjoys running in the yard. She is an inside/outside dog once she feels confident with the humans around her. \n\nOur adoption process involves 3 steps. First, we evaluate you on paper via the adoption application https://www.123formbuilder.com/form-5081187/ or the one that is available on this site. If you meet our requirements we schedule a home visit, we travel up to 1.5 hours from our location. On this occasion, we bring Beca with us to your home. The purpose of this visit is to meet face to face, for you to meet Beca, for us to evaluate your fenced in yard, and if there are other dogs in the home to evaluate the dog to dog interaction.

Though he might not be able to run as fast as he could when he was younger, this beautiful pit mix walks very kindly on a leash and loves to take breaks to sunbathe. PAWS' staff recently discovered that he enjoys an occasional dip in the pool as well.\n\nPickles does well with other dogs and made several walking pals at the shelter before he moved into a foster home. He is growing braver each day, but would do best in a home with children 9 or above.\n\n Please reach out to PAWS if you are interested in meeting this dog: you might just catch him snoozing in his favorite spot: under the table in his room!",

She went through a very extensive expensive surgery to repair her heart valve stenosis, they placed a balloon in her heart. Grace truly wants a family of her own! Grace is such a sweet, loving cuddler, I just know her forever family is out there. She is a 1-2 yr old papillon mix who loves to cuddle and be loved on. She's an easy going girl who enjoys treats and afternoon naps. She is pee pad trained. She does great with other dogs and people but NO CATS! Grace has went back for her follow up and is doing Great!!. She does have some very slight enlargement on the left side of her heart but nothing to bad. The vet is recommending a recheck in 6 months to check to see how shes doing. She's currently being weaned off her atenolol .5mg because she's doing so well. The vet will revisit that again at her 6 month visit. If you think you're the right family for her and can commit to meeting her vetting needs then please submit an application on our website www.dashanimalrescue.org",

They are a bonded pair who always look after each other. They eat together, they walk together, and they chill together. They are very relaxed and well behaved.  They just need a quiet retirement home to live out their golden years. Their ideal home is one with no cats and no little kids. November is adopt a senior month so why not adopt this beautiful Shepard duo who are still looking for their FURever home?\n\nInterested in meeting Lady? \n\nAll Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue dogs are in homes with foster families; we do not have a shelter where dogs are available for daily viewing.\n\nOur process is as follows:\n1.  Review our policies and adoption radius  on our website: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n2.  Submit an application for review and approval;\n3.  MPM Rescue reviews application and checks vet records and references;\n4.  MPM foster contacts approved applicant(s) to arrange a home check and meeting with available dog(s);\n5.   If there is a good fit, adoption is completed with a contract and fees (payable via check or cash).\n\nThe adoption fee is listed here: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n\nDogs from Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue come with the following medical care already provided:\n- Spay/Neuter surgery\n- Age appropriate vaccinations\n- Heartworm test (for dogs over 6mo) and treatment if positive\n- Microchip\n- Deworming\n- Heartworm and Flea/Tick Preventative\n- Any other necessary medical treatment as recommended by veterinarian\n\n*Please note that the identified breed(s) are best guesses. We very rarely have information on our dogs' actual breeds since they often come to the shelters we work with as strays.*",

This beautiful senior girl is pretty much as close to perfect as any dog could be! She is super sweet, gentle and spends her days relaxing. She would make a wonderful companion to any lucky adopter. She is low energy and although she enjoys walks, she loves to be inside hanging by her fosters side. She's a wonderful girl in the house; she's housetrained and has great house manners! Mimi would love all the attention to herself so she needs to be an only dog in the home. If you're looking for an easy, sweet and low key companion, look no further. Mimi is perfect!\n\nMimi was surrendered to the shelter by her owner because they could not care for her properly. Mimi is so very sweet and just wants to be with people and in the air conditioning. :) Mimi does well on the leash and rides well in the car. Mimi is not fostered with children, so for this reason, if there are children in her forever home they should be respectful kids 6 years and up. Mimi is spayed, up to date on vaccines, on monthly preventatives and microchipped.\n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $250 which includes routine vetting and spay/neuter. ***Please note that our first step is submitting an application (it does not commit you in any way but allows us to discuss with you if you and the dog are a good fit).\n\nIn addition, an important step in approving adoption applicants is to complete a vet check. Vetting of current and past pets is very important to us, thus we will be speaking with the vet(s) listed on your application to ensure that your current and previous pet(s) are kept up to date on vaccines (including rabies), spayed or neutered, maintained on appropriate monthly preventatives and examined annually by your vet.***\n\nIf you would like to meet Mimi , please fill out our online application by clicking HERE and then email Kim at KLarimerLovepaws@gmail.com\n\nIf you are viewing this on PetFinder or other venue , please go to our website at www.lovepawspg.org",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Niko is such a happy dog! Our best guess on breed is maybe pit bull terrier and beagle (?) He is crate and house trained, doing very well with both. He has a lot of energy and loves outside time. Niko likes to PLAY HARD, especially with another canine buddy. He *may be* a little too rough for younger children. We suggest children OVER the AGE OF 8, unless your kiddos are super tough and don't mind getting playfully pushed over by him. Niko is super soft and snuggly and will make an awesome dog for the RIGHT family. Could that be you?\n\nOur first step is an application which can be filled out at: www.cvrrescue.org\n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $175.00 which helps to cover a portion of the care provided, including: spay/neuter, microchip, heartworm testing, deworming, age appropriate vaccinations: DHLP/P, Bordetella, Rabies, and any medical care received while with CVRR. All animals are on flea/tick and parasite prevention for the duration of foster care.\n\nCVRR is a nonprofit organization, we have no paid staff. Applications are reviewed and processed by our volunteers. Please be patient and understand that it takes an average of 7-14 days to process the applications including reference checks and follow-up questions. You can expedite the process by providing phone and email info for all your references.\n\nOnce yo my ur application is approved, we will schedule a meet-and-greet to see if the dog picks you too. If it seems the adoption will be a good match for all, there is an adoption fee and an adoption contract to be signed. The adoption fee helps to cover a portion of the care provided to the animals. By the time of adoption all dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vetting.\n\nCVRR is a NO KILL rescue organization and we have a LIFETIME COMMITMENT to all of our animals. If for any reason the adoption does not work out the animal is to be returned to CVRR. We will re-evaluate and choose a new home based on the best fit for that particular animal. 2/2/21 11:33 AM",

She was immediately spayed, just finished up her heartworm treatment and is ready to start looking for the family that she so deserves to love her.\nBea is very human friendly, loves everyone she meets and loves to play.  We would suggest older children since she is very playful and large enough to knock down and accidentally hurt a small child. She does need to be the only dog.   She gets aroused around new dogs to the point she turns to aggression.\nIf Bea looks like the girl for you, please read our procedures and fill out the on line application, link attached below.\n\n1. on line application\n2. vet and reference check\n3. phone call\n4. home visit\n5 meet and greet\n6. adoption\nWe will travel up to two hours to do home checks. We also truly feel the dogs in our rescue have been through enough. We take in those who are injured, abused, neglected, sick, and abandoned. That being said we search for a home that they are never put in that position again and that fits their personality and needs the best. No more hurt or fear.\n\nhttps://cliffordsarmyrescue.com/1423-2/",

            "description": "BACKSTORY:\nLate on a Friday night we got a message from a rescue friend asking if we had room for a 6-month-old pup, the owner reached out to her but they didn\u2019t have a foster home available. The next day we contacted the owner to get all the details and our hearts were heavy as we could hear the sorrow in his voice. He was having to surrender a pup he\u2019s had since he was a baby due to housing circumstances beyond his control. He didn\u2019t want him in a cage at animal control, he wanted him in a home so rescue was his best shot. We put out a plea to our fosters and within minutes we had a transport team and a foster coordinated.\n\nEDUCATION:\n* Sit\n* Paw\n* Touch\n* Higher energy\n* House trained\n\nACTIVITIES THIS CUTIE ENJOYS:\n* Treats: Whimzies, fish skins, wild weenies, hot dogs if you remove the casing\n* Food: can be a bit picky\n* Toys: hard chews and anything that makes noise\n* Walks: pulls hard at the beginning but eases up, pulls when he sees something he's interested in\n* Playing with toys\n* Going on walks\n* Shoulder blade scratches\n\nSKILLS:\n* Dogs: overexcited, rough and tumble player\n* Kids: 10+, he is a bull in a china shop\n* People: takes time to warm up\n* Cats: unknown\n\nCHALLENGES:\n* Learning to love his crate\n* Not a fan of the vacuum, doorbell, and loud noises\n* Normal puppy behaviors like chewing and mouthiness\n* He enjoys singing the song of his people.. he's a barker.\n* He doesn't realize how big he is",

            "description": "LOCATION: MILO POINT RICHMOND \n\nLily is an active, full-throttle kind of girl! Grab life by the horns and run with it... leading the way! She is super confident, a bit bossy, and selective about the company she keeps. Lily isn't a social butterfly, she would love a home with a couple active adults who don't have a ton of social activity in the home. She will protect, and maybe get possessive if allowed, so best to keep some boundaries with her! Smart, athletic girl who needs dog savvy folks with a yard and time to provide lots of love, activity and ongoing training and stimulation.\nShe doesn't love crowds, so no dog parks for Lily.\n \nExperienced dog-savvy applicants ONLY. \n\nThank you for considering adoption of a Milo Foundation Sanctuary dog. Our Sanctuary is where our rescued dogs who have had difficulty in a home in the past, have behavioral issues, or too much energy, or for some, aggression issues with other dogs, or intense stranger danger that make them more difficult to safely and happily live in urban environments. These are not beginner dogs or for the most part nor are they for families with children. IF you are looking for an easy dog to add to your family, we suggest looking at the dogs at our Adoption Center, Milo Pt Richmond. BUT, if you can offer a safe and nurturing home to a dog with some behavioral \"quirks\" please do send an application today. Thank you.",

He is a big, strong, healthy pup and needs an owner who will work with him and bond with him.\nWe adore this handsome boy!!\n\nAdoption fee is $275 and includes all vetting -  he is current on all shots, rabies vaccine, heartworm tested negative, neutered and microchipped!\n\nPlease contact us to schedule a meet and greet with this handsome boy!!",

She is also quiet and well-behaved in the home, including when left alone.\n\nSince Shelly is very food motivated and eager to eat her meals, she gets fed from food dispensers requiring work or smarts to retrieve the food (puzzle bowls/toys, snuffle mats, etc.).\n\nShelly will do best in a home with active adults (older children, ok) and no other pets as she is she is unpredictable toward other dogs and has a prey drive for small animals. However, due to her obedience training, she has learned to tolerate passing by other dogs when out on walks/jogs. If a backyard is part of her furever home, it should have a secure fence.\n\n\u201cShelly is a sweet, affectionate girl who loves to be pet by everyone, including strangers she meets on walks,\u201d says her foster mom.  \u201cAnd people frequently remark on how beautiful she is!\u201d\n\nShelly is spayed, vaccinated, and microchipped.\n\nTo learn more about Shelly, please contact AmsterDog at info@amsterdog.org or fill out our application at www.amsterdog.org/application to get the process started.\n\nThank you for caring about a pet in need!",

She loves cuddling, playing with her Kong and other chew toys, and peanut butter.\n\n*But* she also becomes very protective of her \u201cperson\u201d after she settles in and becomes comfortable and has shown to lunge at and nip/bite others as a result. She has been abandoned and given away so many times that her biggest fear is losing anyone that shows her love and kindness of any kind.\n\nShe is also highly reactive to other animals so she must go to a single-pet home, with no children, and a very experienced person willing to work with her and provide the training and behavior modification she needs under the intensive direction of a behaviorist/trainer for a period of 3-6 mos.\n \nThere must be someone out there who will see this sweet little girl as the diamond in the rough that she is and show her she need not fear being abandoned ever again.\n\n----------------------------------\n\nIf you are able to help us help Skye, please contact AmsterDog at info@amsterdog.org or fill out our application at www.amsterdog.org/application to get the process started.\n\nThank you for caring about a pet in need!",

He is a wonderful dog who is loving with people. He is not good with other dogs and has shown aggression with fellow canines. He will need training to react appropriately with other dogs. Dobi enjoys lying in the sun in the yard, but he prefers to be in the house next to a person. He is good in the car and walks well on the leash. Dobi needs to be the only pet in the home, with an alpha experienced breed owner who will work with him on soclizalization around other dogs.

He has been vaccinated and dewormed. He is heartworm negative. He is friendly with people and other dogs. He was obtained from a rural county animal control. He is a handsome boy. To reiterate he is a beagle mix (a beagle mixed with walker hound or treeing walker hound). Applications can be found on our website at www.wagsrescue.com. \n\nOur Adoption Area - WAGS RESCUE is based in BUCKS COUNTY. Therefore, a majority of our volunteers live in the Bucks County area. WAGS will consider adoption applications for people living in the BUCKS and MONTGOMERY areas. On a case by case basis (depending on distance and availability of our volunteers to do a home visit), we may consider applications in the PHILADELPHIA area as well as parts of CHESTER county.\n\nDue to a higher than normal volume of applications, we will not be doing any adoptions outside a 50-mile radius from Horsham Veterinary Hospital.\n\nThank you for your understanding.\n\nTo begin the adoption process please, fill out our online application. Go to wagsrescue.com and click on adoption form.\nPlease call Susan @ 267-312-3372 if you have questions.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Owen is a sweet and affectionate dog who loves to cuddle and thinks he is a lap dog. He is extremely playful and has lots of energy. However, he does like to cuddle up and relax with you. He LOVES to chase lizards and frogs in the yard. He is a very intelligent boy who is strong-willed but wants to please his person. He would do best in a home with older childen due to his size and strength. As he is physically strong and has a strong prey drive, he needs an owner who is equally physically strong to walk him.Owen thinks of small animals as 'toys.' Sadly, he fatally injured a small dog while playing with it, so he cannot be in a home with small dogs, cats, rabbits, etc as his prey drive takes over. He is great with bigger dogs, though:)",

Lots of cuddles on the couch, snuggles in bed at night, and sleeping in late! Power walks are where he shines! He only has three paws but that doesn't slow him down! He has incredible speed and balance.\n\n \n\nZion is completely housetrained, good about baths, and has been crate tested with outstanding results! He even does well independently in the house; after being alone for hours, he was still sleeping on the couch.\n\n \n\nHe'll do best in an adults-only home with an experienced adopter where he can shine as the only pet. Provide him with a safe, comfortable home and this boy will thrive. Make sure you scratch his chest...his right ear will stand up in appreciation!\n\n \n\nHe doesn't need toys, just you!

            "description": "Jake Ryan could be compared to a fluffy teddy bear - he has a soft coat that's great to snuggle up with and he'll always be there for you when you need him! Some of Jake's favorite things besides snuggling are eating treats, watching tv, exploring new places and playing fetch. He's great at catching the ball and will even bring the ball back to you (most of the time). Then when it's time to relax, Jake is happy to oblige, rolling over on his back for belly-rubs, his tail happily wagging. Between his amazing smile and his goofy antics, Jake is guaranteed to brighten your day. He loves being with his friends, is eager to please and he'll never turn down a treat, knowing he needs to get into a 'sit' for his reward. In addition to being a volunteer favorite, Jake has made a lot of doggie friends, too, and had a blast on a recent sleepover with one of his canine pals. Jake is also thriving in APA!'s Total Obedience Program (TOP), which is modeled after the AKC's Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Jake has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! Jake is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told 'free,' coming when called and 'place', which means Jake will go to a specific place in your home on command. Once Jake successfully completes all the skills on his training plan, he will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Jake is working hard to become a wonderful companion, and as a part of APA's Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with him after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA's CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193 Jake Ryan is currently accepting applications for forever homes, although households with little kiddos or cats need not apply. But if you're looking for a steady companion that you can bring on your adventures, look no further and come on down and meet handsome Jake Ryan!",

He has not had any accidents in or out of the kennel.

He s decent on a leash and he will make an active family a wonderful companion.  He was pulled from Lockhart pound near Austin and transported by some good Samaritans to CCPAL rescue.  He has already started his vaccines and will be ready for his forever home soon.  He has recently had his tail amputated.  He is neutered and ready for his forever home.  He teeth look great.  He is currently here in Texas.  He can be adopted locally or we can work with one of the wonderful transporters to deliver him to Washington, Portland, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Vermont or all along the East Coast.  His adoption fee is 200 and transport is 185.  Rhode Island and Massachusetts are not states we adopt to because of the regulations imposed by these states. \n \n \nContact Marlene at 210-867-1769 or email to ccpalinquiries@gmail.com if you have questions.

            "description": "I am an owner surrendered, English bulldog mix...if you like bulldog snorts, I'm your girl! I'm 2 years old, house trained, dog friendly and I love people. She is great with kids of all ages, she prefers women but we think that's workable through trust building with a man in the house. She can be territorial with food & toys (toward other dogs) and she can be picky about her dog friends. This girl really wants to trust someone, she would be wonderful in an adult female only household with or without children or in a household willing to show her that men can be trusted. She is house trained, knows basic commands & is a super sweet meatball.\n\nPlease visit our website at www.pupandcatco.com/application to complete an application on me.We do not have a shelter facility and our pets are housed in foster homes, vet clinics and local boarding facilities.\n\nMany of our adoptable pets attend adoption events each Saturday at Mall of Georgia Petsmart in Buford, Georgia from 11:30-3:00 pm\n\nPlease check with us to find out if a particular pet will be available. Dogs going to adoption event are typically posted on our Facebook page the day prior.\n\nDetails about our adoption procedures can be seen at www.pupandcatco.com.",

Treasure has been in boarding waiting on someone to love him for 5 years! He plays outside every day, but 5 years is way too long. Treasure absolutely loves playing chase and fetch with tennis balls, soccer balls, footballs, etc, going on hikes, playing with the volunteers' kids, and relaxing in the sunshine. He is so well behaved that he's toured museums and several historic sights that don't even allow dogs!\n\nTreasure has a high prey drive which means that he wants to chase small creatures like squirrels, cats, and little dogs...so no cats or small dogs in his future family, please\n\nTreasure really enjoys snuggles, chicken nuggets, car rides, walks, and playing catch with anyone who will throw the ball. Again and again and again.\n\nIf you are interested in making him part of your family please visit our website and fill out an application!\n\nhttps://www.pupandcatco.com/We do not have a shelter facility and our pets are housed in foster homes, vet clinics and local boarding facilities.\n\nMany of our adoptable pets attend adoption events each Saturday at Mall of Georgia Petsmart in Buford, Georgia from 11:30-3:00 pm\n\nPlease check with us to find out if a particular pet will be available.

            "description": "This gorgeous girl is 3 year-old Twix.  Twix is a sweet girl who just needs a little time to warm up to you!  She was rescued from a hoarding situation and has some skin conditions that need managing, but she was recently spayed and is otherwise a healthy girl.  Twix is approximately 50 pounds, so she is just large enough to make a great foot warmer and just small enough that you can lift her into the car!\n\nTwixie is a very sweet dog who loves belly rubs, kisses, and sticking her head out the car window.  When she is excited, she snorts like a little pig!  It\u2019s so cute!  She needs a little bit of patience and a little bit of space, but she will be following you around in no time!\n\nTwix is really good on the leash and usually walks at your pace without pulling.  She will sometimes freeze up when she sees strange people or dogs, so she might prefer to go on walks at a time when there are fewer people out.  Stairs can be a little intimidating, but she\u2019s tough and she has made a lot of progress!  We\u2019re still working on some basic commands like sitting and coming when called. She recognizes her name now and will sometimes come when called, but she does get distracted easily.  \n\nTwix really loves her treats and they can help get her attention, but sometimes she can\u2019t pass up looking at all the people and cars going by!  She is comfortable napping and relaxing in her crate when the door is open - we leave it open because she also loves our couch! - so we think she could be fully crate-trained pretty quickly.  She does have quite a bit of separation anxiety though and will need to work on staying on her own.\n\nWe think Twix would probably do best in a house without other dogs or small children because she is sometimes afraid of dogs coming near her while on her walks and small children making noise seem to scare her.  She hasn\u2019t been around cats or small animals before.  She is interested in insects though and will try to get rid of all the flies in the house!\n\nPlease help us get Twix into a safe, loving forever home!  If you're unable to help by adopting, sharing this post or donating is always appreciated.  Don't forget, Passion for Pitties is a 501(c)(3), so all donations are tax-deductible!\u2026every little bit helps!\n\nIf you would like to adopt or foster this loving dog Twix, please fill out an application at www.passionforpitties.com under the \u201cAdorable Adoptables\u201d heading.",

            "description": "My name is Asifa,\n\n    I am a rescue from Kuwait about 8 years ago. To a pack of nomadic, wild dogs roaming the desert, I was born on a Camp before being rescued and bought to the U.S. at 4 months old. I got my name from a Kuwaiti friend which means \u201cOrganizer\u201d. I do have Shepard in my DNA so naturally I do like organization and daily activity. \n\nI have long, black thick hair with a curly tail and weigh 75 lbs. with a charming and loving personality.\n\nI LOVE to be with people, in the middle of all the action. Walking, jogging, car rides, running in the yard and all the attention you can give me, I do have a lot of energy.\n\nI love to sleep close to you by the bed, but will occasionally get up to check things around the house and come right back. I'm a great watchdog.\n\nNot too fond of other dogs but with some patience, time, and slow introductions, I will accept one. I lived with a couple of  other companions before and learned they can be my friends.\n\nI can be vocal and bark at anyone that comes around the house or through my yard, just to let everyone know I am on guard. But accept all visitors happily once my owner lets me know all is ok. I Love to chase all other animals away though that includes, squirrels, deer, and have chased a small fox that came too close to our house once.\n\nI am beautiful and UNIQUE. I talk a lot with hush like bark just to get your attention, especially if I need water, or would like us to go out and do something.\n\nNight time I like my dog treat, will roam around the house checking up on things, like to be where I can see outside and make sure all is good. I will sleep close to you, esp at the foot of the bed on MY bed.\n\nI will love and trust you with all the loyalty I can give, just give me attention, include me in activities, and let me know I am doing good by you and you will see I am a loyal companion and just want to be a family member too.\n   I am spayed, had my vaccines,  heartworm neg.   and very  healthy.  I am the perfect dog , friend , companion for the right home .  Everyone loves me because i'm so smart and loyaI also I  love to walk.  We can exercise together. .Everything you want!  Come and say hello.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------\nfrom owner \nI wish time was different but I am looking for a beautiful active  family to take her in, Asifa has too much energy, requires a lot of attention, affection, activity and difficult for us at this time to give her everything she desires.\n\n\nI love her a GREAT deal and only want the best for her and a family with  older kids  or teens who  can provide her with more attention., more active life and more of the love she craves.\n\n  she must have a fenced yard, no electric fences, No cats.  email for an application Laura@RoadHomeRescue.com\n no phone calls. we do a trial foster period.  a meet and greet once approved\n\n more pixs to come.  This is a beautiful ,special dog who needs  an exceptional home.  We had a trainer work with her so she walks well  on  a leash and listens to your commands,.   she will be loyal and devoted. if interested let me know and I can set up a chat with her guardian.",

Lady is at the Shelter now, happy and friendly with the new people and dogs she's meeting.  She would prefer to have a home without cats.  Her adoption fee is $300 to help cover the medical costs of getting ready for adoption. For our application, please email rescuebc@hotmail.com  Include your location and a phone number for future communication.\nThe first step in our process is to submit an application for review.

She is a very pretty girl with an independent streak and would benefit from training for leash walking. She would do best with an experienced owner and a no small children, no other pet home with a fenced yard. She does enjoy a good scratch and a belly rub. She may repay you with a big kiss! River's foster reports that she is doing well at home and is really enjoying their backyard. Even though she is independent, she does listen, is housebroken and crate trained and knows many commands: sit, stay, come here, eat, wait, paw, back up, stop, go in (crate). She loves rolling in the grass and LOVES the sandbox. If you are willing to give River the patience, love, and exercise she deserves, apply at humanesocietycc.org.",

I am an energetic, playful guy but I also have a shy, cuddly side as well. I enjoy going on walks, car rides and I even know a few tricks! My previous owner said I did really well with crate training, and that I would do best in a home with no small children or small dogs. I may seem intimidating at first, and some men scare me, but I'm a very sweet boy once I know that I can trust you! If you're looking for a smart, loyal new buddy I'm your guy. Just call down to SPCA Florida and ask for King!",

As you can see Brienne has a cauliflower ear. Most likely caused by untreated infections and or a hematobium that was left untreated.\nBrienne is a good girl and can be goofy at times. She walks well on a leash and knows basic commands.\nBrienne is housebroken and crate trained.\nBrienne would do best as an only child, she has issues with other dogs.\nBrienne Is a very silly girl who loves to play!",

She is a happy girl who loves to play.\u00a0 She definitely prefers male dogs over female dogs.  She plays rough but she isn't aggressive.\u00a0 She enjoys going for short walks, but she isn't a long walker or hiker.  Her foster parents exercise her by throwing a ball for her in an enclosed tennis court once a day and that's enough for her.\u00a0 She is housebroken and crate trained.\u00a0 She wouldn't do well being left alone all day in a crate, but she's fine if left for a few hours here and there.  \n\nTulip is not as comfortable with men as she is with women.  She will not approach men she does not know and won't interact with them until she learns to trust them.  Some men she just never warms up to.  We don't think she would do well in a home with only men.  \n\nTulip has been spayed, fully vaccinated and microchipped.\n\nTulip's adopter must live within an hour's drive of Atlanta.\u00a0 We always do a home visit before an adoption.\u00a0 Tulip's adoption fee is $250.",

A caring neighbor found him, tried to return him, & the owner said he didn't want him anymore, & to just leave him outside. He is now a Saving Hope dog, & ready to find his FOREVER home! He is a lab/Dane mix, approximately 8-10 years old. He does okay with dogs, but can be picky. He prefers they give him space. Toby is not bothered by cats, or kids, but does like to be left alone when sleeping, so older kids that can be taught that would be better. He is such a fun dog, & we know his perfect home is out there!\n\nTo set up a meet and greet or inquiry about a dog, please first fill out an application at https://savinghoperescue.org/contact. It doesn't obligate you, but it is the first step. We don't get to all of the inquiries but respond to all applications. Thank you for choosing to rescue!",

            "description": "Dawson is a nerd. He is a 5 year old, barely knee-high meatball weighing in at 75 pounds. He is obviously a pit bull and he is hard to place because he's a pit bull. I can't claim he's a suave George Clooney type, or rippling in hotness like a Jason Momoa, but he has his charms. Let's talk about them.\n\nThis dog LOVES toys. He loves to run and play. He loves to romp and toss his toys in the air. He would sell his soul for a tennis ball and he will bring it back to you every. single. time. He loves to give kisses to his people and he is the most affectionate dog ever. He is well-mannered and very people social. I have attached video of him singing with an 8 year old girl. He is incredibly sweet and lovely. \n\nOn the downside, he's never going to be good with all dogs. He has his friends but we never know who he will like and who he won't, so he have decided needs to be an only dog. He's also no cat. In the interest of strict honesty, he farts like a demon and could clear a room. He needs a home with a fenced yard and people who appreciate a snorty, low-riding fat boy. \n\nThis dog survived Hurricane Dorian and a pretty crappy life before that, and someone out there wants a knee high dog to be their love and companion.  If you are interested in adopting this dog, please apply online, at https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/ and then email nicole@bigfluffydogs.com. \n\nOur main website, www.bigfluffydogs.com has more information about us and the rescue process. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters should understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. Homes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for 1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (i.e. a 4-month-old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break). 2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise. 3.) Socialization.  The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home. 4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded ten-fold, for years to come.  Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy.  Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time-consuming and can be expensive. All dogs require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well-socialized dog is more than worth the effort to get them there.",

This incredibly affectionate, loving lady adores all people. She loves being with them, shadowing them through the house, giving kisses, and hoping for lots of belly rubs. She's a strong, energetic girl who likes to go for walks. She is working on learning how to walk nicely on leash but will need some continued training to reach her politeness goals. At home, she's happy to chew her toys and bones - or whatever she finds. She's also a house-trained lady who stays home alone well, snoozing on her bed. Boop hopes for a home where she can get lots of attention from her humans, going for frequent walks. She'd also love a backyard to exercise in. Come meet Boop, you'll be her newest best friend!",

She's approx. 2 years old. She's a typical shepherd.... smart, affectionate with humans, vocal and a bit bossy. She's been fine with dogs we have introduced her to but there is no way we can say how she would do with your mother in laws dog, it would depend on her dog, proper introduction, etc. We do not have children nor has she met any while in our care but we have no reason to believe she wouldn't be fine with children. Rosie loves playing fetch and knows some basic commands. She can be a fence jumper, she would not be a dog you could leave unattended in a yard.\nShe would be a great companion for most homes.\nADOPTION REQUIREMENTS & PROCEDURES\nMutt Match L.A. does not adopt out of state nor do we adopt on a first come first serve basis but rather to the home that is best suited for each particular dog and breed. An application, home check, contract and adoption fee are required for all adoptions. All dogs will be, or required to be, spayed/neutered, current on vaccinations and microchipped before adoption. Most of our dogs are from local LA area shelters, we generally have no prior history for them.\nAdoption fees vary between $350 - $450 for puppies 8 weeks - 5 years, $350 6 - 9 years and $250 for dogs over 9 years. Adoption fee covers spay/neuter, vaccinations, microchip a wellness check, any additional medical expenses necessary and of course the all the love and daily care we take with each dog before they are adopted.\nWe believe a well behaved dog is a happy dog and companion. Therefore, we require at least one session with one of our recommended behaviorists for a reduced fee which is not included in the adoption fee.\nWe are a busy fully functioning rescue and facility, unfortunately, we do not take requests for more photos and/or video.

Her intake paperwork stated that she didn't get along with other dogs, but while our rescue not only has she gotten along just fine with other dogs, she's been playing with some of them!\n\nThis little girl is crate trained and appears to be potty trained. She can be aloof, so her new owner would need to understand how to incorporate a dog into their home and establish the humans as the leaders. Our trainers are available to help with the transition.\n\nBaby does best when she has a job to do, before her pets. She likes to work and have a purpose. Of course, like all good dogs she also likes to laze around in front of the TV.\n\nBaby's new family should be made up of older respectful children, with no chance of smaller children in the future. She will also need an owner that understands how to offer a balanced life to a dog - so she can have a FUR ever home.",

He was pretty feral when we pulled him. Since being with us he has settled down quite a bit. And while he isn't ready to go to his forever home just yet, we wanted to get his information out for his fans.\n\nCruz absolutely loves the carefree life he has these days. He never has to worry about his next meal, he gets lots of cookies and treats, he has some very good furry friends and a soft comfy bed in his very own crate.\n\nCruz will tolerate our head trainer touching him and he no longer tries to bite her. He will be available for adoption once he can be handled by a stranger with no negative behavior being displayed. He still has a ways to go, but we are so proud of how far he has come!\n\nCruz requires weekly training sessions. If you'd like to help sponsor his ongoing training please donate here: www.TheRescuedPup.com/donate",

She is such a sweet girl, she is living with other dogs now in her foster home and does great with them.  It will take Nancy some time to warm up to her new home so it will take someone with patience until she comes around.  Once she does she doesn't want to leave your side. We do prefer Nancy not be around small children since she does require some time to warm up to you, she would be great for an older couple or a single person. She is house trained and good on a leash, she does better with a harness. If you are able to give this girl love and a forever home please:\n\n contact us @ adoptions@emilysfriendsrescue.com  \n\n\n \nThe money collected covers any medical treatments the dog may have had while in our care.  All  of our dogs are altered (spayed/neutered), have had all shots (age  appropriate in the case of puppies) including Bordetella (kennel cough),  rabies, and the distemper/parvo series. Dogs have been heart worm  screened and are heart worm negative, have had a clear fecal exam and  are up to date on Frontline and Heartgard. Adopters  will receive copies of all vet records, rabies certification, and tags.  The adoption fee also covers all transport and health certificate costs  we incur. Dogs from out of state travel on USDA inspected humane,  healthy, & sanitary animal transport professionals. \nDisclaimer:  Please note that the breeds posted on our dogs' biographies are our  best guess based on years of working with rescue dogs. Adopters who need  to know the exact breed or mix of breeds of a particular dog must have  the dog's DNA tested at their own expense.",

The people at the shelter think I\u2019m very sweet and goofy and I love them too! I\u2019m not sure about other dogs right now. My friends here think maybe I had some negative experiences with them in my old life. But who knows what relationships can form once out of the shelter! Kitties are too tempting to chase and bug so I need a home that is meow-meow free! I will be current on vaccinations, dewormed and spayed prior to adoption. Yay!

He was terrified to leave the only home he had ever known but has quickly warmed up and is enjoying all the walks and attention from staff and volunteers once he adjusted. \n\nGrover lived with 2 women his whole life and wasn't socialized much to other people so he is fearful at first especially with men. Once he feels comfortable he quickly becomes a cuddly silly boy with his chosen people. He may get fearful with visitors and protective so needs a lower traffic home where he can be introduced gradually to new people, or put in another room when people come over. He bonds to a female owner very quickly and believes it is his job to protect them- the perfect social distancing dog during these crazy times! His ideal home would be with just one or possibly 2 women only as that is what he is accustomed to. \n\nPlease submit an application from our website www.rbari.org. He is 3 1/2 years old and a lab/Catahoula mix we believe, with gorgeous partially blue eyes! Primary Color: Tan Secondary Color: White Age: 4yrs 2mths 0wks Animal has been Neutered",

            "description": "Hi, my name is Bliss. I was found as a stray in Coachella Valley, and taken to a local shelter. The shelter tried finding my owners, but nobody came forward to claim me, and I didn't have any potential adopters. The rescue coordinator contacted this shelter to take me in because I was put on the euthanasia list when I showed \"aggression\" toward a new dog that was supposed to be my new kennel mate. Since I have been here (Came in January 2020), I have been more outgoing, social, and accepting of most of the other dogs here. I definitely do not like cats, so it would be best I went to a home without any. The staff are working toward my behavior with other dogs, but would not label me as \"dog aggressive\" since I have not tried harming any other dogs. I do, like most other dogs, bark at other dogs through the fence, but have not tried to go after another dog outside of my kennel. I am cat aggressive, so I should not go to a home with cats. I love to chase and catch rabbits, mice, and squirrels, and I am a very good hunter!  I love to be loved on, cuddled, and love to nap. I started limping and walking funny one day, so the staff took me to the vet. I have 2 bad hips and 1 bad knee. I have osteoarthritis, as well as hip dysplasia. So, my bad knee, and both of my hips are bone to bone. The vet said due to my age, and breed, surgery is not a good option for me. I just need to rest and live out the rest of my life in a calm and loving environment. I am on medication, which is pretty affordable, but I need it to help control my pain. I have been in a foster home since March, and they have labeled me as a lovable couch potato! I am pretty low maintenance, and just want to relax most of the day. I have had little to no accidents inside the house. I would love to find a home with a family who will love and cuddle me. I am not an escape artist, but I can jump a 6 foot fence if left alone. If you have any questions, or would like to meet me outside of my kennel, please ask staff.\n                                                            Love,\n                                                               Bliss",

She was labeled with severe aggression and had massive tumors on her belly from what looked like breeder neglect. She was miserable and afraid. Thanks to the help and support of her sponsor, Kaley Cuoco, we were able to rescue this beautiful girl. \nOnce Bunny gained some weight, she was spayed and had surgery to remove several cancerous tumors, as well as dental work. When the tumor test results came back, we found out that poor Bunny has hemangiosarcoma, a very aggressive type of cancer. She doesn't have a long time to live but has already out lived the time frame given by doctors and doesn't look to be giving up any time soon! This girl is a fighter with a zest for life. She is active and alert. Loves her walks and loves play time. And even though she has few teeth left, she LOVES her bully sticks and other chew treats. \nDue to her condition we are hoping to get her into a forever home to live out her final days/weeks/months, being loved on by a family. Something every dog should get to experience. \nBunny is dog aggressive so her ideal home would have no other pets. She is sweet with all humans. Though she has not been around kids, we would expect her to be great with them too.",

I love to sleep late, take naps, snore loudly, watch too much TV AND am a HUGE fan of cheese and peanut butter!  I am a calm guy who is very comfortable at home on the couch I am equally happy to look outside or be in the yard sunbathing and napping in the fresh air.  I am an easy going cuddle bug whether on the couch or in a bed but I am also happy and confident enough to be on my own.  I walk nicely on a leash but may need some breaks in the walk because I can get tired.  I am free to roam in my foster home but easily goes into my crate and am quiet while there.  I LOVE all humans, big and small and am a gentle soul.  I am looking for my furever home with my furever person/persons/family and look forward to meeting you ALL!  If you are interested in meeting me, please send an email or fill out a pre adoption application and a CDR volunteer will get back to you just as quick as they can!\nCuddles and kisses-Mike\n\n\n\n\n**The ADOPTION FEE for this pet is $400-450.00,  which includes getting the puppy/dog up to date on rabies, distemper and bordetella vaccines, fecal test and deworming if necessary, heartworm test, spay or neuter (not including pre-surgical bloodwork) and a microchip.

To apply for Sage, fill out an online application at http://cayugadogrescue.org/wp/adoption-process/ and the rescue folks will forward it to her current guardian!  \n\nHello! My name is Sage, and I am incredibly sweet and playful girl who loves being outside and exploring new things!\n\nQuick Facts:\n\nBreed: German Shepherd/Lab mix\nGender: Female, spayed\nAge: 3 1/2 years old\nSize: 62 pounds\nGood with\u2026\nDogs?   I'm scared of dogs I don't know! (see more below)\nCats? Not sure\nKids? Yes! 7+ years\n\nHistory\nWe adopted Sage in April from a shelter in Tennessee where she had been for about 3 months after being surrendered by her previous owner. We don\u2019t know much about her previous life, other than that she was surrendered. She is awesome, we love her, but without a fenced yard, we are unable to keep her safe (see details below).  We hate to have to rehome her, she\u2019s so wonderful, but want to be clear that it\u2019s not her fault, we just don\u2019t have the fenced yard situation that she requires for her safety.\n\nPersonality\nHi everyone!  I\u2019m such a happy girl!  Everyone says that in addition to being absolutely beautiful, I am also incredibly sweet and am awesome at making new friends  with people and other dogs quickly!  I let everyone pet me (so nice!) and I sometimes give kisses when I am extra happy!  I like to hang out near my people and will often follow them from room to room, keeping an eye on things, seeing if anything interesting is happening.  I like to be next to them either on the floor or on a couch (when allowed)\u2014but definitely in the same room.  For those who love to have a dog all over you, I have to warn you that I am not a huge snuggler.  This is very normal for shepherds and shepherd mixes-- we like to be close, but not right on top of you \u2013 which they tell me is perfect, because at 62 pounds, that would be a lot of dog on your lap!\n\nI am such a friendly girl, completely housebroken and am very smart! I\u2019ve learned a whole bunch of super fun commands like: sit, come, stay, shake, and off.  I am working on learning to not pull on the leash when I get excited or see a chipmunk-- they tell me this is a very high level ability and will take some time.  I love to learn, love positive reinforcement strategies, and love your attention and the treats that come my way when you teach me things! \nWhen I am not outside, I love to look out the window and watch the birds and critters, so I am hoping for an adopter who has a good view spot for me in the house!  So fascinating!! I also like to nap during the day on the floor or in my dog bed, and sometimes on the couch when I am allowed. I am very chill while indoors and only bark occasionally when a package is delivered or a garbage truck stops outside. \n\nI do some silly things\u2026I bark a little bit when dreaming, I do a happy dance when it\u2019s time to go for a walk, I will play fetch with a squeaky ball and tug with a rope toy until the end of time,  and I am a huge fan of ice cubes!  Really!  When I hear the ice maker making cubes, I run into the kitchen and sit excitedly until somebody gives me one!\n\nI absolutely LOVE being outside and running around \u2013 FAST! A house with a big fenced in yard is essential for me! I don\u2019t like being tied to a lead in the yard, and have figured out how to escape from collars and harnesses when I really want to--even when they are on me nice and snug--and once I wriggle out, I can\u2019t help but to GO-GO-GO!  Which obviously isn\u2019t safe for me--there have been some close calls and we don\u2019t want any more of those.  I love going for hikes, walks and runs on leash, so here's the deal with those things.  I never try to wriggle out of my collar or harness when running/jogging with you, so that\u2019s safe.  On hikes and walks on leash, you need to pay attention to the presence of bunnies (my biggest weakness) and other critters, and when you see me spin around and try to pull hard (that\u2019s my method of getting out of the collar or harness), just grab me quick and hold onto me until the bunny or critter is gone.  And please watch the doors, as I could sneak out really fast if someone is coming or going and I spy something outside that is irresistible.  \n\nCohabitation\nI currently live with 2 children, ages 7 and 10 and am very sweet and gentle with them.\n\nI am sweet and friendly with the few dogs in my neighborhood whom I know and trust.  With them, I wag and play bow and act very friendly.  I am however very scared of dogs whom I don't know.  With them, I will be very barky and spazzy and lunge and make a big fuss because I am just very scared.  So, I need to go at a very slow, careful pace when meeting other dogs.  If there is a dog in your house already, would be best if it was a calm, smaller, sweet and friendly dog who would give me the space I need until we can become friends.  I seem to feel most comfortable with smaller, calm, male dogs. \n\nI have not been around any cats so we aren\u2019t sure if I like them or not. I\u2019d be glad to have a meet and greet with any potential fur-siblings!\n\nFavorite Activities\n\u2022\tPlaying fetch with a squeaky ball!\n\u2022\tRunning around outside!\n\u2022\tBeing scratched behind my ears!\n\u2022\tHiking, Running, Walking!\n\u2022\tChilling near my humans!\n\u2022\tGazing out the window!\n\u2022\tBeing brushed!\n\u2022\tChomping on ice cubes\n\nWhy I am looking for a new home\nI really need a home that has a large, secure, fenced in yard for me to explore and run around in.  My current family has tried a dog lead as well as an electric collar for me to be outside and I have cleverly learned to escape any harness and collar and have found that the reward of running free is greater than the risk of the electric fence collar. I have escaped frequently and my humans fear for my safety each time.  I am learning emergency recall training and do EXCELLENT with it indoors or when attached to my lead and under supervision but I am unable to come back once I have escaped and am out running free.\n\nMedical\nAll shots are up-to-date.  No medical issues that we are aware of.\n\nSummary\nI will make the most wonderful forever dog to someone who will take me on hikes and walks, play fetch with me, and let me run free in a big, fenced in yard! I truly am such a love and incredibly smart, I just need to find the right forever family so that I can be safe and happy and live my very best life!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting me, fill out an online application at http://cayugadogrescue.org/wp/adoption-process/ and the rescue folks will forward it to my current guardian!",

OR EMAIL her at t,ink@att,net   The link to our Petfinder page is down and we will not see any messages sent through Petfinder***\n\nApollo is a 2 year old Pit Bull Terrier, weighing approximately 55 pounds. (as of 7/24/20)\n\nHe's still new to us and hasn't been tested with cats, dogs or children, so we're unsure how he would do with them.\nHowever, we were told that he was originally rehomed because he killed his former family's chickens, so we know that he cannot be placed on a farm with chickens or other foul. \nHe was then given to another family, who was hoping he would be a friend for their other Pit Bull, however their dog attacked Apollo and they realized that they also needed to give him up.\nWe were told that he absolutely wasn't the aggressor and he didn't even fight back.\nHe had some wounds/injuries to his head and neck when he arrived with us 2 weeks ago and they're healing very nicely. \nHe has been an absolute doll with everyone he's met at our clinic so far. He really loves attention and has an A+ personality.\n\nPlease call or email the clinic if you'd like to meet this handsome little guy in person, instead of responding to the Petfinder link.",

            "description": "PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE BIO ON THIS DOG BEFORE REQUESTING AN APPLICATION.  MANY OF OUR DOGS HAVE STRICT REQUIREMENTS FOR THEIR ADOPTION.\n\n4 year old female Chihuahua, about 5 pounds. Little Miss Priya! She is shy and sweet. She is quiet unless you leave her alone and she will howl to let you know you forgot her (don't worry it doesn\u2019t last long). Her tongue is often hanging out from her tiny underbite. She'll sit on her hind legs and beg you to share, only to bring it to her friend Binde (my adopted Smidget). Priya needs to learn more about life and that it's not so scary to be a dog. She needs a human that will love on her but also not baby or carry her around all the time. She needs to learn to dog and her past life didn\u2019t seem to teach her that skill. Crate training has helped support her in knowing she's ok to be in the same room and not be held. She will need to have another confident doggie companion who will help her build confidence and show her that strangers and moving cars aren't so scary while on a walk or out in public. She is great in the car and will look to you for reassurance. She is fine with cats, other dogs, and older children (foster brother is very dog savvy 7 year old and she comes with us to daycare and is okay with all the kids fully supervised). Priya is shy but once she warms up she will be right next to you at your feet or in your lap. She can have a bit of a sensitive tummy so a consistent diet of a food with no chicken is ideal. Watch out though, she is mischievous and will jump on the table, the counter, and sniff for stuff to get into, if she can. She's a tiny girl but the sweetest attitude that needs a home to build her confidence in this big world! \n\nAdoption contract and fee applies.  All adoptable dogs can be met at adoption events hosted every weekend. For a list of scheduled events go to: https://www.facebook.com/SmidgetRescue/events .  Smidget Rescue is not a shelter, and dogs cannot be seen at the Rescue location. All dogs are fostered throughout the Puget Sound area and are brought to the events where they can be met by prospective adopters. Additional pictures of adoptable dogs can be seen at: https://www.facebook.com/SmidgetRescue/photos_stream?tab=photos_albums.   All adoptable dogs are spayed or neutered at 6 months of age or older, and always before being placed in their new homes.  APPLICATIONS CAN BE OBTAINED BY EMAIL ONLY. Adoption process includes application, meet & greet, home visit and reference check. Email Jamie at smidgetrescue@hotmail.com or click on the CONTACT link on this page.  PLEASE DOUBLE CHECK YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS BEFORE SENDING.  We get a fair number of incorrect emails and Jamie is not able to contact potential adopters.  Notice:  We do not ship dogs out of state.  If you live within a five-hour radius of Seattle, WA, (such as Portland, Vancouver B.C., etc.), we can arrange for a home visit.  If your home seems like a great fit for the dog you would like to adopt, you must then drive to meet the dog at one of our weekend events or at the fosters home.\n\n",

            "description": "Sisely is a 1-1/2 year old, 31 pound, hound mix with a beautiful brindle coat. Her favorite things are: food & treats (she is quite food-motivated!), toys (she loves any & all toys!), and exploring the great outdoors.\n\nSisely is shy, especially around new people. She may bark or growl to start, but warms up to new people eventually and is very sweet and affectionate once she is comfortable. Given this, she may do best in a home without very young children. She gets along with other dogs and likes to play with them after getting to know them. A home with another dog would be ideal, but is not required. She is not a fan of cats and needs a kitty-free home.\n\nSisely loves being outside and being active. A fenced backyard would be ideal since she is still working on her leash skills. Her house training is also coming along nicely. Sisely is quite happy to go into her crate when needed, especially if food or treats are involved. She does eat her meals in her crate due to her\ntendency\nto guard her food from other pets in the home.\nSisely is not a fan of car rides - she gets anxious and car sick. This may improve in time or with medication.\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online at http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.\n\n*Some of our animals receive a high volume of applications, and we strive to select the best home for each animal. However, we have many wonderful homeless pets available.",

We are providing a service to Del Norte County Animal Control to help with adoption. Please contact the shelter directly if you are interested in meeting or adopting this dog--their info is below.\n\n\nMeet gorgeous Zaylee!! She is a two years young, highly athletic, beautiful tri-color bully blend who entered our shelter a little over 9 months ago. Zaylee came to us after enduring highly unstable circumstances. Living a transient lifestyle where she was frequently left alone in the woods, tied to various objects when her owners were not around. Understandably, she does not respond well to strangers who approach her kennel and is uneasy around new situations and people she doesn't know. It is important her new family understands this uneasiness, to avoid putting her at risk for a misunderstanding.\n\nZaylee takes her time getting to know you before giving you her immense love and devotion. Given a little patience, respect and kindness she really comes out of her shell and illuminates a heart that is made of pure gold. \n\nZaylee is young with puppy-like energy. She loves to be silly, run zoomies, splash in the water, play fetch and search for those pesky gophers. While she loves to run and play she also enjoys chilling out with her favorite humans on the sofa and unwinding with some her favorite toys.\n\nZaylee has responded very well to harness training and is our preferred method of working with her. She knows how to sit and stay and would love to continue working on her training with you.\n\n A home with adults or older teens is preferred. This bubbly little lady will flourish with experienced owners who can give her time, patience, love and structure.\n\nZaylee can become reactive to other dogs and small animals. She would really shine and thrive as the only pet in the home.\n\nUTD on all shots, vaccines, spayed and in great health. She really struggles with the stress and boredom of kennel life and is ready to be rescued!\n\n Zaylee is looking for someone who understands her need for exercise and mental stimulation. She is an amazing dog with a lot of potential who will flourish in an active and attentive environment.\n\n\nDel Norte County Animal Control is located in Crescent City, CA. They are open Monday thru Friday from 8am to 5pm. They are closed Saturday and Sunday.\n\nAddress: 2650 Washington Blvd, Crescent City, CA 95531\n\nShelter phone: (707) 464-7235\n\nAdoption fee: $ 75.00\n\nEmail: delnortedogs@gmail.com\n\nFind them on Facebook: www.facebook.com/DNdogs707 \u201cDogs of Del Norte County\u201d\n",

She\n\nstarted life as an outdoor dog and is quickly making the transition to living inside a home.\nShe loves sleeping indoors, having soft beds, getting lots of treats and good food, and don't forget attention!\nShe is almost entirely house-trained and she is learning to walk on a leash.\n\nWonder Girl can be nervous around new people and experiences and is easily startled by loud noises, but with a little patience and allowing her to warm-up and gain confidence, you will find she loves attention and is an affectionate girl.\nShe also really enjoys being in a fenced backyard exploring the outdoors and playing with other dogs. She would enjoy a doggy companion in her forever home, but may prefer there to be no cats.\n\nWonder Girl is still young and is a chewer. However, she is easily distracted with chew toys like peanut butter stuffed Kongs and rope knot toys when you aren't directly supervising her. And while she isn't a fan of car rides (because they are new to her), she is a smart girl and can be easily de-sensitized and learn car rides are fun.\n\nAdd a little magic & wonder to your life, and ask about adopting Wonder Girl!\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online at http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.\n\n*Some of our animals receive a high volume of applications, and we strive to select the best home for each animal.

You see Tate is a little vision impaired seeing mostly shadows and movement but you would never know.  This boy can run full speed zoomies in the back yard faster then his foster sister.  On walks he sees other runners and dogs just fine.   Once he get's to know you and the lay of the land his less then perfect sight does not hold him back!\n\nHe is a very affectionate boy who loves to nuzzle in the crook of your arm making his grunty sounds.  He's full of energy, playful and sweet.  He doesn't share any of the mischievous traits of his sister as he doesn't bark, doesn't dig.  Tatey is has learned Sit and no and is working to master down (laydown), stay and shake.  \n\nTate is great in his crate and due to his limited sight he's safest there when you're away from home or at work.  He'll need additional support and patience to achieve longer stretches outside of the crate when your not home and to adjust to new situations which can make him a little anxious.  You may need to consider a walker or coming home from lunch if you don't crate him and keep him in a smaller safe area of the home.. \n\nPlease visit our website to apply to adopt. Copy and paste this link into your browser address bar: http://alsiberianhuskyrescue.com/adoption-application.html \n\n\nPlease visit our website for more information and to apply to adopt www.alsiberianhuskyrescue.com \n\nOur adoption fee is $350.  The fee is a donation to help us pay for spay/neuter, vaccinations, parasite treatments if necessary, and microchip.  Our dogs are housed in foster homes where they learn manners, such as housetraining",

            "description": "Willow went missing on 2/14/08. She is microchipped and was outside for 10 minutes. We have never seen her since. We posted flyers and contacted all of the area vet offices. Willow loved people but didn't like cars so if someone took her she didn't jump willingly into their car. She had a red heavy duty collar with tags to our rescue and her rabies tag on it. We live in a rural area but we do have neighbors and no one ever spotted her. We will be keeping her listing active until we know what happened to her... At Autumn Acres Animal Rescue we believe each individual animal matters. We take in special cases some of which will stay with us as a sanctuary dog.If the animal is listed as a Socially Imperfect Dog this means they have special needs and special requirements for potential adopters.If the animal is listed as a Socially Imperfect RESIDENT this animal is NOT available for adoption and is one of our sanctuary residents. We list them on our sites because they still matter and they still need donations to help with their long term care.Check out our website for more information: http://www.autumnacres.org",

            "description": "Socially Imperfect but now AVAILABLE - ROCKY Rocky was living a forgotten life. He was never allowed outside, not taken on walks, and never exposed to anything beyond the four walls of his indoor pen. He was surrendered to a vet clinic that had him for several months. They had a difficult time getting him adopted due to his shyness. He finally found a home and then he escaped immediately. He was so scared that he freaked out over the change and managed to slip his leash and was running scared. Volunteers and employees of the vet clinic were able to catch him and he was returned to the clinic. He was there for another several months. They weren't having any luck placing him and they were considering euthanizing him because of his fear/anxiety and unlikelihood of finding him a home. A rescue friend begged us to take this fellow and we did. The first few months were so scary for our friend Rocky. A leaf blowing on a tree would make him duck and run. He was so scared of life. He liked people, but only those he was able to get to know. New people would make him scared all over again. Scared to the point he'd get digestive upsets :( Eventually he got to know our core volunteers and become friends with us. He has learned to LOVE his play yard and he will bark at strangers to try to protect his yard now. He's great with the other dogs, he loves his pen and his bed. He's a happy boy now who gives hugs to us. But he's happy HERE. A new home will trigger that fear and anxiety again. A new owner needs to get to know him slowly at our place and work with him slowly to increase his safe zone. He's not going to just 'fit right in' in a new home. He's going to take a bit of time and patience and skill to get him to there. Rocky is terrified of cameras, cell phones angled at him, getting too much staring attention. As you can see in his photos...he's socially awkward. He looks away when a photo is taken, quite on purpose lol. We LOVE this boy. Rocky has a monthly sponsor, but we have many other special dogs who need a sponsor. Check them out on our Socially Imperfect Page. Interested in adopting Rocky? Understand this won't be a oh, fill out the application and come get him type of deal. He's in Richmond, MO. You'll be visiting with him a couple times a week for a few weeks...until he knows you and then you'll be walking him around our property until he trusts that you can keep him safe, and then we'd progress to car rides. He needs slowly acclimated to new places/people. He's absolutely worth it though! Now, let me tell you a bit about our Socially Imperfect Residents Program: We provide sanctuary for those socially awkward animals. Those who have overwhelming fear and anxiety of new people or places, and those who have triggers that sometimes make them lash out to defend themselves. As long as they pose no significant danger to their caretakers and we can keep them happy they will have a safe place to stay with us. Im a socially awkward person. In crowds I can only tolerate so much before it exhausts me and I want to leave. If I was to ever be put in a shelter I could see myself being a shut down type or (more likely) one acting aggressive because of the fear/danger I see myself in. Im not a social butterflydoes that mean I shouldnt be allowed to live? Sadly, in the case of shelter dogs they often are the ones euthanized. The one rescues overlook because PEOPLE overlook them. People assume they didnt connect when meeting or looking at that specific dog, often thats not the case. These dogs need a bit of time, a bit of TLC, and some understanding in order to start to connect. Most of the time if you give them a chance they turn out to be wonderful dogs. They may never want to go to a dog park, or go to a pet store, but they will be your most loyal companion and best friend at home. If a rescue takes one of these dogs in, some will euthanize because the dog needs time to adjust and they wont give it the time, others will keep the dog and try to find a home for him/her no matter how long it takes. Were one of the ones that makes a commitment to that dog. We will do whatever we can to keep the dog happy. This requires a long term commitment and sponsorship is always needed. Can you help?

Ejay has a skin condition. Other Dogs: No ?(ok with resident dogs in the home) Cats: No House-trained: Yes Crate-trained: Yes Kids: Yes  If you would like to foster or adopt Ejay, please contact AmsterDog at 917-689-8414 or info@amsterdog.org. To get the process started, please fill out our online application. Link to our Application: https://www.amsterdog.org/application Owner\u2019s comments: Ejay is not a fan of other animals initially but once he gets used to them, he is ok with them. He is unfriendly towards any animals near the property that he does not know. Ejay is good kids and people in the home but takes a little bit to get used to outsiders and will bark if anyone enters the home. He would be perfect in a quiet home with a dedicated owner who could work with him on his behavioral issues. He is crate and house trained. Ejay has allergies that require either a monthly shot or daily oral medication along with medicated baths. The allergies cause redness of the skin along with itchiness and once the shot wears off, a slight odor indicating he needs his next dose will peak through. He is very respectful and polite to us, and has a very strong trust with me. When he feels uneasy he clings to me for some balance to ensure everything is okay. We would be willing to help with some of the expense of his allergy medications if needed. They aren't that expensive, but we know it\u2019s tough right now, and we just want him to have what he needs.",

            "description": "Cannoli is a short & stocky pittie mix, approximately 2 years old and 56 lbs. She has the cutest ever freckled nose that looks like chocolate chips, a white dipstick tail, and goofy ears that are always at attention. Her soft brown eyes match the color of her fur and her head and chin are SO soft, they feel like velvet! This girl\u2019s tail is always wagging, and she loves to meet new people. Her favorite weekend activity is going on a PFP Pack Walk and stopping for a pup cup on the way home!\n\nCannoli came to us after being surrendered to the local city shelter. While at the shelter, her belly \u2018popped\u2019 and she was suspected to be pregnant. We quickly found out that she was in fact NOT pregnant but had eaten a corncob that was causing severe bloat and discomfort. She needed emergency surgery but is now fully healed and her vibrant, playful personality is really shining through!\n\nCannoli does well with other dogs who match her energy level. She loves to play and can be a bit bossy/pushy. She could do well in a home with another larger dog, but she absolutely loves to be the center of attention so being an only dog would be ideal for her. Cannoli does not do well with cats and small dogs so her forever home should not have either.\n\nCannoli would also do best in a home with no children or only older children (14 & up). She can get very excited while playing and is still learning appropriate playtime behavior with humans. She is unaware of her size and strength, so if she is around small children, she should be on leash where she can be controlled and taught to be calm and gentle. \n\nCannoli is a gorgeous dog that loves to be loved. Her favorite spot is to be snuggled up on the couch with her humans. Cannoli completed a basic obedience class and is an eager learner. She is very treat-motivated and responds well to boundaries and direction. She is great on leash, easy to walk, and does not react to other dogs/humans. What she does like to do is test her boundaries to see what she can get away with. This requires that she have a routine and clear expectations with no wiggle room for her to sneak herself into. She LOVES a good road trip and will do anything for a treat and a snuggle.\n\nVisit www.playersforpits.com/adoption-survey today to meet Cannoli!\n",

She is HIGH energy and loves to play. Jersey is very social so she likes being with her humans. She would make a great running partner. She is crate trained, walks on leash, but does need a little work on her house manners. She gets along with other dogs and does ok with cats, but will need to improve her cat manners. You can find your adoption application on our website, www.4pawsfarm.org. Her adoption fee is $250. We do reference checks, home visits and vet checks.",

The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ.

I love other dogs, I can be a little iffy towards new people, but instantly become a love bug when I warm up! So please bare in mind, I like people once I know them and can trust them. I use to be in a crate when nobody was home and am fairly house trained! I love car rides! I know key commands like: Sit, no, and drop! I am leash/harnessed trained. Although at first since being back at the shelter I may be a little rowdy at first, so it may take me a second to reuse my former training. I'm not considered a good fit with children because sometimes I don't know my own strength during playtime and I get very tense around small . So I'd rather hang with adult humans only as little ones seem to make me feel uneasy.",

He is 4 years old and 50 pounds. Redd is a little timid on first meet but warms up quickly and is friendly.\n\n**BECAUSE OF OUR REQUIREMENT FOR A HOME VISIT, WE ARE ONLY ABLE TO ADOPT TO HOMES IN THE NORTHERN VA / MARYLAND / DC METRO AREA**\n\nWe have adoption events EVERY SATURDAY from 12-3 p.m. Please note that not all dogs can attend every event, so if you are interested in meeting a particular dog, please complete a no-obligation application on our website at http://www.muttloverescue.org/application.html OR write to adopt@muttloverescue.org.\n\nUpcoming adoption events:\n\nMutt Love Rescue is doing everything we can to ensure the health and safety of our volunteers and adopters while continuing our mission to find homes for as many dogs as possible.\n\nEffective immediately, we will not be holding our weekly adoption events. Dogs available for adoption can be met by appointment only. Potential adopters should submit an online application at http://muttloverescue.org/application.html. Once we receive your application, we will contact you to let you know the next steps.\n\nWe are always desperate for foster homes, now more than ever. If you are interested in fostering during this difficult time, please complete an application... unless you are a previous adopter/foster, then you can just contact us via phone (703-988-2608) or email (adopt@muttloverescue.org) to tell us which dog you want to foster!\n\nFor information on sponsoring this dog, please write to adopt@muttloverescue.org.\n\nWE NEED FOSTER HOMES! FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE EMAIL ADOPT@MUTTLOVERESCUE.ORG.\n\nVisit us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/muttloverescue\nFollow us on Twitter: @Muttlove_Rescue",

            "description": "KiKi is such a sweet girl,  but can be very skittish.  She is definitely the alpha female and enjoys \"humping\" her friends just to show them who's the boss!  She can be a bit unsocial towards other pups, especially at first.  She may bristle or growl, but eventually may be okay, (if they allow her to be the boss lady!) Her perfect home would probably be her as an \"only child\".     She is very frightened of bad weather or loud noises and does best if left alone when she's anxious.  She would probably be okay with occasional visits by children, so long as they don't attempt to interact with her until she gets used to them, but would likely do better in a home without children living there.    She is a bit timid at first around strangers and may take a minute to warm up to new humans, as well as unfamiliar dogs.    She's not a big fan of cats, but otherwise, she seems to be able to get along with other pups.   KiKi LUVS to be rubbed and cuddled by her humans.   KiKi would be the perfect pup for porch napping or stretching out in front of a big cozy fireplace in the wintertime.    She is a big fan of napping & her favorite spot is her big soft bed.    KiKi needs someone who can give her lots of time & attention.    The perfect adopter for KiKi will be patient with her until she gets comfortable, but also someone who is prepared for tons of cuddles once she finds her happy place.         Like most rescue pups, this furbaby is HW+, but is currently undergoing the *slow-kill method of treatment (see more information below).  \n\nAll our adoption fees include spay/neuter, micro-chip, up-to-date vaccinations, including rabies thru date of adoption. This pup is heartworm positive and is currently being treated with the *slow kill method, approved by her veterinarian, on prevention & on flea/tick prevention. \n\n*The slow kill method of treatment, simply stated, is a 30 day regiment of  doxycycline followed by a monthly dose of Advantage Multi for 12 months, then retesting.   Most dogs test negative after one year of following this treatment; however, we always recommend that potential adopters consult & follow the advice of their family veterinarian upon adopting any of our hw+ pups.   Although the fast-kill method is still considered the \"gold-standard\" by the AVA, and may be preferred by some vets; the slow-kill method has proven to be effective in our rescue. The main reason we utilize this method is due to our limited financial constraints and the high number of our rescue pups that are infected.   In the cases of severe infection and if the pup is highly symptomatic, we sometimes use the fast-kill approach instead.   Again, we recommend for you to consult with your veterinarian after the adoption is complete and follow their recommendations.   \n\nIn order to be considered for one of our beautiful pups, please go to our website and complete and application: https://www.mustluvdogs.org/adoptable-pets.\nPlease note that we are a DUE DILIGENCE adoption organization. Part of our approval process requires, among other things:\n* Experienced pet home with verifiable vet references/history preferred, but we realize that everyone has to start somewhere, so all applications will be considered.\n*The majority, but not all, of our pets require a fenced yard or secure enclosure.  In the case of apartments, we require Landlord approval and designated dog area in complex.\n*Verifiable good veterinary history INCLUDING regular vaccination/visits and good Heartworm Prevention history is a MUST!\n*Adopter must be able to have time to spend with the pup and be able to provide the pup a safe environment to live.\n*ALL our dogs are expected to be primarily INSIDE dogs.  They MUST sleep inside the home.  We truly understand that some folks have working dogs (i.e. farmers, ranchers,etc); however, the majority of our dogs have had a rough life prior to coming to us & we want to make sure that they are showered with LUV & maybe even a bit spoiled for the rest of their lives. \n\nOther facts are also considered, including whether children or other pets are a good fit with the dog. \n\nMust Luv Dogs reserves the right to deny any applications that we don't think are a good fit with the pup. Our first & foremost concern is the dog's best interest. It is our MISSION to place them in a home that is a great fit for their needs for a lifetime of luv & being part of a family.\n*We will consider adoptions in any area; however, will do not ship or transport puppies under the age of 12 mos. We will ONLY transport an adult dog on a transport approved by MLD, at adopter's expense.\n* In order to be affordable and afford every family an opportunity to have a pup of their own, we keep our Adoption Fees low; however, please keep in mind that the fees we charge do not cover all costs for the pup.  Any additional donations are greatly appreciated!\n\nPlease note that all of our pets are in private foster homes. In order to reduce any stress or confusion for our pups, we require a completed, approved application BEFORE setting up a meet & greet for any of our pups.  Alternatively, you are always welcome to come meet any of our pups at one of our regular Adoption Events.   Our events are always posted on PetFinder OR on our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/mustLUVdogs.org.\n\nFinally, THANK YOU for considering Must Luv Dogs for your next pet. \n\n*Most dogs require a fenced area in yard. \n*Apartments okay IF nearby dog park or walking trails (with landlord appoval).\n*ALL dogs must be INSIDE dogs and treated a part of family. \n*We are a DUE DILIGENCE Adoption Rescue.  \n*Must have good Vet history & Heartworm prevention is a MUST!\n*ALL dogs are fully vetted, spay/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption.\n\n",

Most likely used to hunt and breed both are shy and feel safe in the company of dogs and staying outside but are also fine coming in and sleeping and making themselves right at home.  They no longer shy away from humans,  they want to be pets but Sweetie is having a harder time of it.  Sue was adopted and now Sweetie is even more of a loner, waiting for her new home.  They both had a rough few initial weeks, not eating and acting overall odd, but they both came out of it.   Sweet dog who hopefully will learn to be a dog now that she has a chance to know what being a pet is.  Probably around 11 years old.",

He gets along with other dogs after they have been introduced. He's about 76ish lbs.  This big boy doesn't really realize how big he is so no kids under age 10! He he has been known to chase livestock so no farm life for this boy! \n\nFrosty would be a wonderful bud to teach to hike with you. He'd love a large fenced yard to spend time in with his new family as well.\n\nOur adoption fee includes age appropriate vaccinations, deworming, microchipping and transport expenses. Adoption fee is $450 to help offset travel and medical expenses.\n\nAll children at home should be at least age 5 to be approved for adoption!\n\nApplications can be made at bigdogrescueproject.org/adopt",

He'd love to find a calmer adults only home away from all the hubbub. Anakin needs some time to adjust to new people and situations. He can be hand shy at first but off-leash he is calmer and more social. He's working with our professional trainer but he will still need a skilled handler who will help him feel more comfortable on leash.  When it comes to his interactions with other canines, he meets them well but they don't hold his interest - and he does better with easygoing ones. He enters the play yard calmly, meets everyone well, avoids problems, and  appears more relaxed and happy off-leash. Anakin would be so grateful if you would give him a chance.\n\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website!

Noddy is very intelligent and will do anything for a treat.\n\nNoddy is a little shy, sensitive and unsure when meeting strangers, but once she warms up, she is very sweet, loving and playful. She loves car trips and belly rubs. She enjoys playing with toys and if given a hand towel, she will toss it in the air to catch it again.\n\nShe is dog friendly, however she is very picky who she likes. We cannot pinpoint anything in particular she is just fussy who she wants to be friends with. \n\nNoddy is crate trained but will only tolerate being in one for a short period of time and will give her best Basenji howl to let you know she wants to come out. \n\nNoddy is on anxiety medication and it has really helped her become a more well-rounded and calmer dog.\n\nApply to foster at:\nhttps://www.animalhopeandwellness.org/fosterprocessandapplication\n\nApply to adopt at: https://www.animalhopeandwellness.org/adoptionandfosterapplication\n\nWe are by appointment only. You must submit and have an approved application before meeting AHWF animals.\n\nFor General Adopt/Foster Inquiries: adopt@animalhopeandwellness.org",

            "description": "Hello everyone!  My name is Etta and I am a sweet loving 8 year-old Pittie!\n\nMy name is Etta and I listen pretty well when my name is called.  I\u2019ve had plenty of experience with puppies of my own.  Because of this, I am very CARING of my 2 \u00bd year old foster brother Dallas.  He and I gently play together a few times a day, often times playing tug-o-war with the toys, which I am perfectly fine with sharing.  If I am done playing before Dallas is, I gently start to tell him I\u2019m over him and may even voice it a little bit, but never get aggressive.\n\nI LOVE to sleep on my fluffy bed next to my foster mom while she works during the day.  We have a routine down to where if I get up, I typically need to go pee and as long as she listens, I don\u2019t have any accidents in the house.  Plus, I have a nice size yard to play in and get lots of exercise there.  Walks are great too and will typically listen when told to ignore something, but I do get excited when I see someone or another pup that I want to play with.  So, I am working on that!  \n\nI also love my 17 year-old human foster brother.  He will play with me and pet me and let me give him all kinds of kisses!  We all usually have play time outside in the evening til we are all pooped out.  I even like to lay on my Human Foster Brother and sit on his lap.  I don\u2019t get on the couch or beds unless you ask me to.  When its bedtime, I will go into my crate no problem and sleep there through the night.  It\u2019s nice and cozy!\n\nOh, I also love to go on car rides!  We go at least once or twice per day.  Starbucks trips for puppaccinos are my FAVORITE!  I will climb up into the car no problem, but sometimes need assistance with getting out. I do have a tumor on my back leg, which will be getting removed in August.  It doesn\u2019t really bother me much, but it does get in the way of things. \n\nFor the most part, I\u2019m a pretty chill girl that loves to be by my foster mom\u2019s side.  I do bark a bit when I hear noises outside that indicates someone might be there, but I just want to make sure everyone is safe!  Other than that, I do howl and bark a little when I want attention or when she leaves me at home, but will eventually settle down.  I am looking forward to meeting you and getting my forever home! ?\n\nIf you would like to adopt our loving dog Etta, please fill out an application at www.passionforpitties.com under the \u201cAdorable Adoptables\u201d heading.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.We're going to get the awkward part of getting to know each other over with first, and talk about my genitals.\n\nI came into rescue at 6 months old, after I was surrendered to a local animal control facility. I had broken my penis and my previous family couldn't afford the surgery to fix it. A Rotta Love Plus sprung me from the shelter and took me in to meet the surgery team that very day. It was determined there was no saving 'Little Joey' and we parted ways. A guy's still gotta pee though, so the surgeon performed a scrotal urethrostomy. This created an opening where my testicles were, routed my urethra through it, and now I officially pee like a girl. Unless you're looking for it, it's not very noticeable. I do need a little daily care down there. Nothing too fancy, just need you to wipe me a few times a day to make sure the area stays clean. This helps prevent urinary tract infections (UTI). I can be at a higher risk of having a UTI because of my surgery, so you'll need to keep an eye on my peeing habits and take me in asap if you suspect an issue. I've been doing well since the surgery, no infections to report! I take a urinary tract supplement and probiotics daily, to help maintain good health.\n\nInteresting genitalia story out of the way, let's talk about the other most important thing to know about me; I need someone to hold my paw for a little while when I am making a new friend.\n\nYou can't really get to know a guy when he's stuck in a strange place, in pain, and then doped up on drugs after a crazy surgery. It wasn't until I started feeling better that I was able to act more like myself. While I am absolutely in love with everyone I know, and even the surgery team said I was sooo good for all the things they had to do with me during my four days with them and at follow ups, I can be a bit uncomfortable with strangers. I can walk down the street and be around people I don't know just fine, they don't bother me at all, but if someone I am not familiar with comes right up to me and wants a hug? I'm out. I may let them know they're creeping me out by barking or growling, as I try to back up and make more space between us. My training and meds have decreased how often that happens though, especially if my people are there to help keep the stranger from being too rude. I do make new friends quite easily though, especially if food is involved. Once I'm familiar with someone, I'm totally down for snuggling, cuddling, playing, making out, you name it. I'm yours. Forever and always. But buy a guy a drink first or something, jeez.\n\nAs I recovered from my surgery, it started becoming more obvious to my people that it wasn't just strangers that gave me the creeps. I was a bit nervous about, and extra cautions around, anything new or unusual. Honestly, it wasn't very normal or healthy behavior for a young guy to be displaying. Thankfully, the folks at ARLP are pretty nerdy and stay up to date with dog behavior and training stuff; they went right to work. I've been doing training, going on socialization outings, and even using medication. I take a daily behavior medication. It's fairly cheap and boy oh boy, has that little pill made a huge difference. I feel much more confident in new places, I recover more quickly if something spooks me, and I'm much more resilient in general. I may need to take my meds my whole life. I might be able to stop once I'm full grown and my brain is fully developed. For right now, they are helping me make better associations with the world around me and allowing me to live a much fuller, happier life than I was before. I remember more from my training sessions, my head feels less chaotic when there is a lot going on around me, and I just don't worry about as much stuff anymore. You and I will need to continue working with my vet to evaluate my medication use throughout my life. You should expect a couple of meet and greets to be part of the adoption process with me. That way, you will get to see who I really am before you decide to call me yours. The folks at ARLP will also require that you and I take a class together when you bring me home. It is included in my adoption fee and will be 5 weeks of online instruction and 2 private lessons during that time. Don't worry, I know all this stuff they'll be teaching us already. I'll help you out and we'll ace this. I freaking love to learn and eat snacks. Might be my two favorite things.\n\nSo, those are the really big things you need to know about me. Equally important when deciding to live with someone forever, but not needing quite as much explanation, these are my other qualities you should take into consideration before asking me out on a meet and greet:\n\nLiving with Cats- No kitties for me, thanks\n\nLiving with Dogs- Maybe, maybe not. I currently have a couple of canine foster siblings. I don't think any of them call me their BFF. Me and the big guy get to wrestle around once every couple of weeks, but that's about it. We are very open and honest around this house and I'm told I'm 'THAT friend'. You know the one. The one that you like spending time with, but only in small doses. They're a lot to be around sometimes and you make sure you have a hard 6pm out when you go out. Me and my foster siblings spend lots of time together but separate. If they are loose in the house, I'm either in my puppy pen or on a leash with the people to help me learn good manners and not have opportunities to be a pushy jerk. I can get a little carried away with play. I'm working on it. If you are mainly looking at me as a potential companion for a current dog, you're honestly better off with someone else. I could likely live with a well-behaved adult dog, that has good dog-dog skills and is tolerant of adolescent stupidity, but you'll need to include some management into our daily lives in the house for a little while yet. I'm very immature for my age. I still have a lot of growing up to do in this area.\n\nDogs in Public- I'm indifferent to the existence of unknown dogs while out and about. I don't care that they are breathing the same air as me, but I'm also not interested in being their new friend. The times that a strange dog has been able to come running right up to me, I try and get away as much as I can. Most of the time, they stick their nose way too far between my legs and spend way too much time trying to figure out what's going on down there. If left to invade my personal space for too long, I may snark at them to tell them to back the heck off and stop with the crotch sniffing.\n\nLiving with Critters- As long as they have their own space and are contained, that should be fine. I live with a turtle. She has her house on the other side of the room and I can't really see in anyways. She leaves me alone, I leave her alone. Nobody gets eaten. Free roaming bunny? House chickens? Probably not a great match up.\n\nLiving with Kids- Not interested. They're cool from a distance. If they want to toss me part of their PB&J, I won't turn my nose up at it, but they move funny and are too unpredictable for me. I'd be looking over my shoulder all day. Plus, I'd probably eat some of their toys. Nobody wants their favorite teddy bear to lose a leg. Or head\n\nHouse or Apartment? - Living in a house would be best. I just don't think I'm quite ready to pass by random people in a narrow hallway every day. Living situations that would require we encounter strangers head-on every time we go out for a walk are probably not a good idea. If you live in a multi-unit building and have a private entrance, that may work out.\n\nFencing- I like to have an open space to run and play in, but it's not a requirement. I have jumped every baby gate I have come across though, including the 'extra tall' one, so keep that in mind. My current house has a 6ft privacy fence and I have not made any attempt to scale it. A shorter fence, or a chain link fence, might get me curious though. I may need to stay on a tie-out if your fence is shorter, otherwise I might take myself for a walk.\n\nEnergy Level- I am a little higher energy and need some stimulation every day, but I can also just chill in bed with you on sick days if needed. I don't bounce off the walls and I don't need to be run until exhaustion, even 15 min of training practice or fetch in the yard is enough for me to need a nap. My people say I'm a really nice walking buddy. We don't walk in the immediate neighborhood (too many unfriendly, loose dogs and people that try to come right up in my face and say hi without being invited) but we hop in the car and go walk around the parks nearby a few times a week. I wear a front-clip harness to help remind me not to pull occasionally when I forget what we are doing, but the majority of the time I just match your pace and am happy to explore with you.\n\nSlip me an adoption application if you are still interested, and we can continue getting to know each other.\n\nIf you're interested in adopting this dog, please view our Placement Process and to fill out an online application.

He wa on deaths door when we got to him but he had a desire to survive and he has! He's flourished. \n\nUnfortunately he lived most of his life outside as a lawn ornament. But since being in foster care we have learned just how much he wants to be with people. He currently takes some medicine to help him with some separation anxiety, he just wants all the cuddles! He's a very sweet boy that is potty trained and works the doggie door like a champ. He's dog friendly and very playful! \n\nTo set up a meet and greet or inquire about a dog, please first fill out an application at https://savinghoperescue.org/contact. It doesn't obligate you, but it is the first step. We don't get to all of the inquiries but respond to all applications. Thank you for choosing to rescue!",

She gets along great with other well/mild-mannered dogs and she has lived with cats before.\nFrannie will require a patient and loving home that can work with her through her flaws. Due to her past, Frannie is very fearful of men and would thrive in a low traffic, female-only home. Due to her fear aggression issues, Frannie does have a bite history, so an experienced, patient, and loving home is an absolute must for her. For these reasons, we will ONLY pursue a home for Frannie with no men and no children. A full consultation regarding Frannie's behavior is included in the adoption process for anyone who is interested in Frannie. \n\nWe have been very fortunate to get to know Frannie as she has been attending daycare and boarding with us for over the last three years. Unfortunately, she has found herself looking for a new home after her previous owner passed away. Frannie loves to socialize and play in our \"calm dog\" playgroup. While we wouldn't necessarily classify her as the cuddly type, Frannie would love to find a home she can call her own again, and a caring person who she can grow close with and trust. \n\nHow our adoption process works: \n\n1) Contact us through PetFinder, by email, or by phone to fill out an Adoption Questionnaire \n2) Schedule a meet-and-greet at our facility in Albany, Oregon \n3) Schedule a home visit/inspection \n4) Schedule a two week trial period to ensure a perfect match \n5) If both parties feel this is the perfect fit, the adoption becomes finalized!",

Due to changes in our adoption policies the process can take a few weeks.\nWe receive multiple applications on some pets and we thoroughly review each one to find the very best home for each pet in our care.\n\nWe do require a fenced in yard, previous pet ownership with vet references. All of our requirements can be found on our website. www.sunnymeadows.org\n",

Due to his size a home with older children is preferred.  River is about 5 years old and 77 pounds.  Please help River find the loving home he deserves.\n\nWe do NOT ship our animals. All adoptive families must travel to us to meet their adoptive dog/cat.

If you're sleeping, she will find you and bark to let you know she has to go. Otherwise, she is very quiet and does not bark at all. She is gentle with meeting other dogs (so long as they are gentle back). She likes being around her person but keeps to herself. She walks perfectly on the leash and would make a great walking partner. Not recommended for homes with cats. Looking for a companion in your golden years? Reba is the girl for you.",

We are happy that Oliver is safe now, will no longer be mistreated, and we can help him find his forever home!\n\nOliver was living outside, but seems to be house trained. He spent most of his time following his owner around all day while she worked outside, and got used to being near his people all day.\n\nHis current fosters report that he is very well mannered, enjoys laying by their feet, and chewing on his antler. Oliver walks nicely on a leash and responds well to corrections. Although very sweet, he can be a bit stubborn and needs someone who can work with him on learning basic commands.\nOliver is sensitive, and will benefit from being given time to adjust to new things. He is used to living around other dogs, but is best solo.\n\nThe perfect home for him would be with someone that is home a lot and has time and attention to give him.\nOliver is really mellow, but can be a howler! We've also heard that he likes relaxing to both classical and reggae music!",

            "description": "Nancy is one of the smallest female Saints that we have had over the years. She currently only weighs 70 pounds and is a walking skeleton. We are diligently working on getting her healthy and putting additional weight on her. She has had multiple litters of puppies over the years. However, those days are over, since we got her spayed. Nancy is approximately 3 years old. She came to us with Rusty and both dogs are very dependent on each other. Nancy will not be ready to go to a new home for at least a month due to her current health. Everything that we are treating is fixable with lots of TLC, lots of good quality food and medications. Nancy will be even more gorgeous once we have added weight to her skeleton. If you are looking for all the benefits of a smaller saint that still has the saint temperament and personality, please consider Miss Nancy.\n\nIn concern for families with small children, we will not adopt a dog to a home with any child under the age of 5. This is due to the large size of Saint Bernards and the safety of your children. Our Saint Bernards are not aggressive or mean in any way, they can just knock down children easily. If you would like to visit our pups please contact St. Cloud's Rescue at www.stcloudsrescue.org or call 972-679-5319. The first step in adopting from St. Cloud's Rescue is to complete an application. The application may be found OUR WEBSITE at www.stcloudsrescue.org. Please click on the application process, complete and then email it. Once the application has been sent please call us to confirm that we have received it. St.Cloud's Rescue maintains the right to deny applications to anyone for any reason we see fit. St. Cloud Rescue is a non-profit 501-c-3 organization. St. Clouds Rescue requires new owners to purchase a one year supply of heartworm preventative from us, which is at cost. We require a home visit prior to all placements. All our dogs must be microchipped at a cost of $20.00. There is a $250.00 donation fee. All dogs adopted through St Clouds Rescue must be indoors. St. Bernards can not tolerate the Texas heat.\n",

Piglet still needs to get spayed and a lump taken off of her leg, but we are starting the search for a forever home.  If you are interested in meeting Piglet, please email me at cbrowder@cityofshelbyvillein.com or call us at 317-392-5127 for a special adoption application.  No one knows her better than her foster mom who absolutely LOVES her, but wants her to have a life where she can be Queen of her castle.  Emily put together her pros and con list for Piglet.  We know that Piglet will thrive in a home with a loving family, someone just needs to give her that chance.  Serious inquiries only, please.  Thank you to Emily for stepping up and helping Piglet and the shelter when we needed it most.   God bless you, chris\n\nPros- super sweet\n            Loves people just likes to meet new ones outside of her home first \n            Is great with kids \n            Loves camping!\n            Loves playing tug of war \n            Her favorite toys are ropes and rope balls\n            She knows how to sit \n            She listens pretty well\n             Mostly potty trained with only a few slip ups \n             Loves to cuddle \n             Does good on a leash and I\u2019m training her to sit to put a leash on and take off \n\n Cons- she is definitely a chewer she is on meds for separation anxiety but still likes to chew unfortunately even with 100 toys in her room she has ate trim, a treadmill (going after a mouse though) a few dog beds, trash, fabric and wood off of the trundle bed in her room but I\u2019ve been working with her and trying to keep her calm but busy at the same time while she goes through heartworm treatment. (She\u2019s done with her shots)\n              She\u2019s scared of cats but doesn\u2019t bother them so that can be a pro and a con\n              She doesn\u2019t seem to like my dogs that are larger than her but she also hasn\u2019t really interacted just sees them through the fence and doors and freaks out \n              This may be a con for some but when she\u2019s laying on you she can be pushy and heavy lol \n              She will chase cars through the fence so a fenced in yard is a must \n              She should probably be the only dog but could always do a meet and greet my dogs all insane and have issues so they aren\u2019t the best to judge off of \n\n\n I know the cons sound bad but I also feel like once she\u2019s in a home where she can be center of attention and have more free range she will make a perfect companion for the right special person/people. All she wants to do is give her love and be loved. \n\n\nOLDER INFORMATION FROM July, 2020 - \nPiglet has had some \"lookers\" at the shelter but once they hear the constant snorting....the interest fades.  The bully mix was probably dumped out in the Quail Creek Addition in Pleasant View.  Although we have received a tip or two as to who the owner is, we are trying to find someone who will give her a forever home and not turn their back on her.  Built low to the ground, she would probably be best as the only pet.  As Zion stated, she's hard to get a picture because she is in constant motion.  We are here weekdays from 10:30 to 4:30 and her adoption fee of $95 covers her mandatory spay surgery, rabies/booster vaccinations, wormer, Home Again microchip and flea meds.  We are still asking for tips if someone knows more about this sweetheart that we named Piglet.  You can even be anonymous.  Questions about our shelter, pets or policies.....email me at cbrowder@cityofshelbyvillein.com or call your tireless shelter team at 317-392-5127.  Thank you for your support of us and what we do....provide love to those that have no one.  God bless you, chris browder\n",

When we got him he was scared of anyone and anything. He was named for the big black Spot on the top of his head. He is making progress one day at a time. With lots of love and attention from his foster family he is slowly over coming his fear of the unknown and humans. He will need a home with lots of patience as he works through his fear but the end result will be worth it. The gentle boy has been living with three active boys - ages - 5, 7, and 11 and Spot has rewarded their affection with with a shy kiss here and there..He loves other dogs so he will need another dog in his forever home to help him and lead him. He loves to play with them. He has ZERO aggression in him. He loves to snooze on his dog bed, appreciates a good chew and toy. He is fully potty trained and will go in his open, comfy crate when he chooses. If you are interested in sweet Spot and giving him a chance as a foster or adopter please reach out to us",

I am a handsome brindle colored Shepherd/Plott Hound mix who is available for adoption through Pets and Vets USA.  \n\nMy previous owners surrendered me due to a marriage problem.  I am housebroken, good with kids and other dogs. I would prefer a home with an 6 foot tall fence, but would do well in a condo or townhome if walked regularly. I am good with kids, but think older kids in my forever home would be best given my size. I know a few commands and since I am so treat motivated I learn new commands quickly with the promise of a snack.\n\n My favorite activities include romping around  a fenced yard, going for long walks, playing with my favorite toys, and spending with my special people.\n\nIf you think I could be the special boy for you, please get in touch with my friends from Pets and Vets USA soon!\n\nEmail: petsandvetsusa@gmail.com\n\n \n\n",

            "description": "Momma dog and 5 puppies need sanctuary and a foster to allow them to grow and nurse.\nMomma Petra NEEDS OUR HELP! This brand new momma dog was part of a trio of dogs that were left behind when their owners were evicted from their home about two weeks ago. They left behind 3 dogs and one of them was this pregnant girl named Petra (puppies were not born yet). A brand new Nashville resident lived down the street and soon learned that dogs were left behind and the house was unoccupied. The dogs were alone for almost two weeks. Some kind souls living across the street from the empty house had been feeding them what they could spare and giving them water from time to time whenever they could. When law enforcement confirmed that the house had indeed been vacated, our Critter Cavalry Rescue volunteer scooped up the three dogs as fast as she could! They were hungry, filthy, scraped up, scared and infested head-to-toe with fleas. They've come a long way in the past 48 hours and we can't wait to get them where they need to be in order to start living the good life forever. Now momma has 5 live puppies that she is nursing and we need to find her a quiet and secluded foster home that can offer her a place to continue to raise these beautiful puppies. Critter Cavalry Rescue will provide all the funds and supplies needed to help this family. We need help placing this family in a great foster home for a little while. Please email us or call.\nccrtennessee@gmail.com or 615-668-5334",

            "description": "Hazel is a very special dog that requires a very specific home. She had a rough start in life. She came to the United States from a Korean meat market and eventually made her way to the sanctuary. She arrived here in March of 2018. While she has been here a couple years, she still has a lot of challenges to overcome due to her rough start in life. Hazel is extremely shy and because of this she is a major flight risk so she needs a home that is very secure. Humans are still scary to Hazel and she does not allow petting or any kind of handling and she does not walk on leash yet. Hazel's caregivers are still working on gaining her trust and eventually be able to get a collar and a leash on her. Hazel likes squeaky toys and really enjoys hanging outside in her run with her dog friends. Hazel is anxious when any people are around. She occasionally relaxes around people she knows well but she much prefers when it is just her and her dog friends around. Hazel can be picky with her dog friends. Due to Hazel being such a special dog, any potential adopter would need to spend time at the sanctuary to really understand Hazel and her needs. Hazel needs a dedicated adopter that can give her a secure home along with the time and patience needed to gain her trust.",

She loves walks and car rides and is very smart.  Rue has learned a few tricks in just a couple of weeks, and has mastered the doggie door to take herself outside. She is house trained and loves to sunbathe in the yard. Did we mention fetch is her favorite game ever?!\n\nRue would prefer to be the only pup in her new home, but she is well behaved on walks and has plenty of love to give a family looking to add a companion! She can be jumpy at times when she gets excited (people are her favorite!), so a home with older children would be best for her.\n\nRue would make a wonderful dog for a very lucky family!

He was born into our care in Jan of 2019.\n\nBreed: Tanka\u2019s mom is a Pittie, she came to us pregnant so we don\u2019t know who/what dad was. But Tank has a lot of Labby characteristics, like longer, thicker fur, size, etc. He could be anything however.\n\nTemperament: Tank is a big puppy with a lot of personality. He would not be appropriate in a home with kids. He needs someone who\u2019s willing to work with him, take him through obedience, and have consistency. He\u2019s a really sweet boy who\u2019s eager to please. He loves treats and is food motivated. \n\nTank has been neutered, vaccinated, & heartworm tested.\n\nTank\u2019s adoption donation is $175 and you can apply for him on our website, www.franciskennels.com",

With one volunteer available to review all applications, we ask for your patience waiting for an email response. While we are closed to the public, we will only be responding to pet inquiries that accompany an application. Adoption appointments are scheduled first come with approved application, first served. (See our adoption procedures below.)\n\nMeet Tangle. This beautiful girl's orange highlights are incredible. Tangle's estimated DOB is 9/3/13 and approximate weight is 56 pounds. Tangle transferred to us from another shelter; and while here, she has learned that humans can be kind. She grows more confident and trusting by the day! Tangle's estimated DOB is 9/3/13 and approximate weight is 56 pounds.\n\nHSPC's adoption fee is seventy-five-dollars through December 31, 2020, unless stated otherwise within the pet's description. At times, our adoption fees are lowered during special events that are posted to our website or Facebook page. Every pet that is available for adoption has been spayed/neutered, microchipped, and is up-to-date on vaccinations including heartworm preventative (canines). Adopters are required to schedule a wellness exam with their veterinarian at their cost within 7 days of adoption.\n\nPlease only submit one application. Once you are contacted by email, you will have an opportunity to provide us with any additional animal(s) under consideration.",

She is a really gentle and kind soul and so full of love. She does not get along with smaller dogs, but with a proper introduction, makes friends with dogs her size and larger! This girl walks well on a leash and is so excited to join you on any adventures, as long as she gets cuddles on the couch after :). She has displayed human guarding tendencies, and her adopter must be ready to proactively address them with positive reinforcement training. She is fully house trained and loves to learn!!",

He is ready for his forever home!!!!\n\nOriginal Post:\n\nEddie is absolutely the sweetest boy who has had the absolute crappiest life!!!! This poor, sweet, completely emaciated, high heartworm positive boy was found in a manhole drain. Did he fall in or did someone throw him there? Guess only Eddie will know. It took the city 3 DAYS to get him out. Whereupon they took him to BARC, the high-kill city of Houston pound, gave him three days to find a home and BAM landed on the euthanasia list!!!\n\nWe just could not let that be this boy's whole life!!!\n\nWe got Eddie to safety but knew we had to do more so we went to Bay Area Veterinary Specialist and saw the cardiologist. He has started on heart meds and slow kill heartworm treatment. We are hopeful that we can give this boy the time he deserves to have a fabulous life full of love!\n\nEddie is probably around 8 years old and is in an amazing foster home with 3 other dogs. He is not a fan of cats.\n\nIf you are interested in loving and spoiling this boy for the rest of his life, just fill out our adoption application and we will be in touch.",

He's a very special kid who's looking for an experienced dog owner who can work with his unique set of needs. Frankie is fully deaf and partially blind. So instead of communicating with him verbally we may give a thumbs up or a gentle pat to let him know he did a good job. Frankie can sometimes get frustrated or overly excited and we're working on teaching him how to appropriately handle those situations. An adult-only home that can continue this work with him will be ideal! Frankie enjoys going on walks with other dogs and he likes to play with dogs who match his play style. However he does need to be the only dog in the home since he's not a fan of sharing his toys or couch space with another dog. Frankie loves going on adventures, especially if there's water involved. But he can also be a couch potato who enjoys a good cuddle. Mostly Frankie just needs a family that can offer him patience and consistency to help him be his best self!",

I'm a little girl named Abby and I am bonded with my sister, Sasha! We must be adopted together, no exceptions.\n\nI am a 7 year old Shih Tzu mix with a very pretty underbite. Unfortunately, our mom is unable to care for us anymore. We are heartbroken so we both need some TLC and a family with patience. I adapt quickly because I am more outgoing than my sister but she is my everything! I lover her so much and I hope you will too! The reason we are listed together is because we want to be clear that we are sisters who are bonded and cannot be separated, no exceptions.\n\nWe are both spayed, vaccinated, microchipped and we love to go for strolls in the park or lounge on the sofa napping. We are mature so we won't be destroying furniture or chewing on shoes. We both get along great with other dogs, cats, and people, inside and out of the house. We are both housebroken and pad trained.\n\nIf you think my sister and I are a good fit for your loving home, and you're looking for two little furbuddies who love to play as much as we love to cuddle, please send in a dog application which can be found on our website at www.anarchyanimalrescue.org/adopt-now!\n\n***Currently being fostered in Suffolk County, NY.

He needs a more laid back and calm environment with a LARGE FULLY fenced in yard. While Christoff is happy to see and greet his person he is also perfectly fine with being left alone to wonder is back yard and chase any wildlife that happens to be around. He CAN NOT be around cats. If you live in a neighborhood that has cats running around and one happens to get in the back yard with him he will kill it. He also is very picky  about other dogs. So far the only other dog he has been ok with was a female husky. However they could not live together 24/7. (Both were moody and wanted things their own way) Food is a issue for Christoff. He has never reacted towards a humane but will not let another dog near his food. If you would like more information please reach out to us.",

            "description": "Pudge\nThis sweet girl wants to give lots of love to the right owner. She is approximately 2 years old, spayed, on heartguard for prevention and frontline. She would be best in a home as the only dog and with a family who will spend time training her to be the perfect companion. She will sit and offer her paw for treats. She loves to chase and retrieve her balls, she is great on a leash, and crate trained. She loves to cuddle on the couch and in your lap (she thinks she is a lap dog). She is housebroken but will pee if she gets in a situation that makes her anxious. She would prefer a female owner. She has lots of potential and lots of love to give the right owner.",

            "description": "Scrappy Doo\nAge: 3 yo\nWeight:6 lbs\nLocation: Oakville  Ontario\nAdoption donation: $400\n\nKINDLY READ SCRAPPY  DOO'S PROFILE PRIOR TO APPLYING FOR HIM!!\n\nScrappy Doo might be a cutie with a sweet side, but his aggression level can be high and he needs an experienced, tolerant owner. Only applicants that have a significant experience in managing aggressive dogs will be considered (a trainer would be ideal, but this is not a must).\n\nScrappy Doo is a very anxious and insecure dog that is interested in attention, but also nervous of it. He enjoys being on his foster mother\u2019s lap, and will look for pets at times, as well as snuggle into her. However, the only time he can be directly pet at this point is when he comes to look for it. Uninitiated touch will result in a bite. Sometimes when he does come looking for affection, he will change his mind and give a corrective warning, like a growl or snap.\n\nScrappy loves to play and chase his toys, although sometimes becomes protective and guards them, which results in attempts to bite if you get too close.\n\nWalks are probably his favourite activity. He is highly active and loves going outside on adventures. He also loves going for a run while his foster parent rollerblades. He is leash reactive and dislikes the act of being leashed, as it requires people to touch him. He will bark, growl and lunge at people, dogs, squirrels, and cars when being walked on a leash. He has shown some improvement in this area, but will need continued work.\n\nHe is also barrier reactive, meaning he is reactive in his crate (which he loves), or through fences. While he is resting he doesn't like others to come close to him, be they dogs or people.\n\nScrappy is housebroken and will happily use pee pads indoors or go outside to do his business.\n\nHe is currently on daily medication to assist with his anxiety and has made some great progress since arriving at CCRT ( initially he couldn't be touched without biting), but this little guy still has a long way to go. He has bitten on many occasions (very hard in some cases). In two instances while working/living with a trainer, he bit unprovoked and had to be pried off. This however, hasn\u2019t happened in his current foster home.\n\nScrappy has potential, but it is important that he is adopted out into the right furever home that can manage behaviours that may be there for a lifetime. Scrappy needs a very specific and experienced home to ensure both he and his new companion are the best match possible. Only apply to adopt Scrappy if you meet the following criteria:\n\n* An experienced owner (a trainer would be a bonus) that can continue to address the behaviours and aggression through positive training and counter conditioning. We also highly recommend hiring a positive behavioural trainer to assist with his care.\n\n* Must have (or buy) bite gloves, and know the likelihood of being bitten (hard) is high.\n\n* Lives in home with fully fenced backyard (not an apartment). Scrappy needs a fenced-in backyard so he can still go outside even if he doesn't want to be leashed.\n\n* Have an adult-only household. Due to his bite risk, Scrappy shouldn\u2019t be around children of any kind.\n\n* Do not have any cats in your house.\n\n* Have either no dogs, or another dog that is calm and confident.\n\n* Have an active household.\n\n*Are willing to come out for several meet and greets with Scrappy prior to adoption to ensure fit, and to learn how to address some of his issues in a safe manner.\n\nUltimately Scrappy is a dog that is fun and does want love, however due to his fears, this isn't always possible.  His biggest chance for success is to have someone that has the knowledge and ability to care for a dog with complex needs.\n\nYou can follow him on his own fb page: https://www.facebook.com/Scrappy-Doo-Chapter-21-110586987430587/\n\nIf you meet the criteria for Scrappy\u2019s new home, please fill out an adoption application. You can purchase a sweater and/or blanket for him, or any of our other fosters dogs.\n\nPlease consider becoming a CCRT Sponsorship Angel for any of our fosters by making a cash donation towards their care.\n \n\n\nFor more information please visit our website www.ccrt.net",

            "description": "German Shepherd Mix I 18 months I Male I 89 lbs\n\nTemperament: Sweet, loving, loyal.\nActivity Level: High!\nVetting: Core vaccines (dhpp and rabies), neutered, microchipped, dewormed, fecal - negative, 4dx bloodwork - negative, heartworm - negative, full blood panel - normal, skin cytology originally showed a fungal and skin infection which has been cured, on tick/heartworm and flea prevention. DJ came in severely underweight with a horrendous skin and fungal infection where there was also a lot of hair loss. After a regime of medicated baths, lots of medication, multiple vet visits, and a change in diet DJ has flourished. Please note that he is eating kangaroo kibble, kangaroo treats and needs to have a medicated bath a few times per week. He may need allergy medication in the future however currently he is doing very well by restricting diet to only kangaroo and having the baths. DJ will also need to continue to gain weight. He is still slightly underweight.\nHousebroken? Yes!\nGood with Dogs? DJ doesn\u2019t have a ton of experience with other dogs. He\u2019s gone on a walk with one dog, and was very well-behaved, a little timid, but never aggressive. Many dogs bark at him on walks, and he has no reaction, and never barks back.\nGood with Cats? No.\nGood with Children? Unknown, but gets scared of kids when they are loud if they were passed on a walk, so would say no kids is best!\nAny noted prey drive? Yes! He will go after squirrels, birds and cats.\nHow do they respond to the outdoors? He loves the outdoors, but prefers quieter neighbourhoods. He loves to run. He will go to the beach but won\u2019t go into the water!\nBusy Streets? Does not like busy streets, at all! He doesn\u2019t mind the cars, or the people so much. But he gets very scared by loud noises! Specifically by skateboards, rollerbladers, groups of loud kids.\nWhat type of exercise do they get and how much? He goes on daily 5km runs to the water, plus a few walks in the neighbourhood.\nHow active are they? Extremely high energy and very active! He can out-run people, and is very hyper in the house.\nCrate-Trained? Yes. This is a must as he may chew things if not crated.\nWalks well on leash? DJ will need more training in this area. He pulls aggressively, and wants to eat all of the garbage he finds on the ground. He\u2019s very strong and quick, and therefore it\u2019s hard to stop him from eating what he finds on the ground. He doesn\u2019t always listen to commands while on leash (mostly never). He also gets very scared by loud noises. When this happens, he will very aggressively pull you home, and there\u2019s no arguing with him when he wants to go home! He\u2019s much better on runs, gets scared much less, doesn\u2019t pull as much, and doesn\u2019t try to eat anything off the ground.\nHow do they respond to commands? Mostly only when in the house.\nAre they vocal? If so, in what way? Yes! Mostly inside! He will bark when people come and go from the house. If the sound of cars or people outside wake him up in the night, he will bark.\nHow do they handle transit or car transportation? Very good in cars, have never taken him on public transit - and probably wouldn\u2019t test that for a while!\n*DJ\u2019s bio may change as we get to know him better.\n*We cannot guarantee breed mix nor age.\n*Comes with 6 weeks of pet insurance valued at $500.\n\nThis DJ will have your heart spinning. DJ is a super sweet dog who is very cuddly and will just want to spend all his time with you. He is highly energetic and loves to run around outside and is the happiest when he can run around off leash with his toys. This hyper boy loves to play with people and has been known to be nippy just like a puppy, he\u2019s a chewer and likes to chew on everything when left alone, including furniture. DJ must be crated when left alone.\n\nDJ would need an experienced loving family who can work with him on his nipping and chewing issues. He would do well with a highly active family with no kids and no other pets in a quiet neighbourhood or rural property with a fenced-in backyard for him to play around in. This big cuddler would like a family who is comfortable having him sleep in their bed, hang out on the couch and even in your lap! He loves people so much, at least one person who works from home is optimal for him. DJ had a severe skin infection and possibly food allergies so is on a restricted diet of eating only Kangaroo kibble and Kangaroo treats, and has improved greatly on this diet. If you think you can give this very sweet boy DJ, a loving home please contact adopt@covetedcanines.org",

            "description": "Dark and handsome, isn\u2019t he? He also has a sweet, affectionate side, with those he's come to trust. But the Daniel who first arrived at our shelter didn\u2019t appear to be very interested in making friends. We soon discovered that this very anxious boy responds well to the sight of a leash, treats (yum!) and the opportunity to play fetch in the yard. He's two years old (born 6/18) and weighs around 50 pounds.\n\nA poster dog for rough starts in life, Daniel has been passed around the system\u2014from a county shelter to a rescue group, through a couple very brief adoptions and back again\u2014before landing at STAF. He has most definitely been hit with hands, objects or both in his past. He just cowers if you look at him cross-eyed. He puts walls up with strangers, but beneath that tough-guy exterior is a dog eager to feel safe and be loved. To get there, he needs a confident leader and structure.\n\nDaniel is housetrained and has great house manners, although he may try to grab a shoe or another object when he wants to play.  He can also be a bit mouthy when he plays. He loves chasing balls, does very well with other dogs, and loves to take long walks. He would probably be happiest in a home with another dog that is fun-loving and confident and had a big fenced yard to boot! As long as he gets the opportunity to burn off some energy, he\u2019s content to entertain himself inside with his toys or chew on a bone.\n\nNot a fit for novice dog-owners or those looking for a dog to cuddle and spoil, Daniel will need a family willing to devote some time and patience to establish trust. His ball intensity and hyper-focus also make him a superb candidate to be a working dog ... anyone in the market for a drug/bomb-sniffing partner?\n\nDaniel\u2019s ideal home will have ...\n* Previous dog experience.\n* An understanding of positive training and how to build an insecure dog's confidence by providing structure, consistency and a calm, safe environment. \n* A secure fence (at least 48-inches tall) for indulging Daniel\u2019s love of fetch and working off his considerable energy.\n* Possibly a confident, female dog to match his size and energy.  \n* No young kids. \n\nPlease visit www.STAF.org for visiting hours, a downloadable application, and additional information.\n\n\u2022  All of our animals are spayed/neutered and current on shots.\n\u2022  We do not do same-day adoptions; we ask that you return for a follow-up visit before taking an animal home.\n\u2022  You must be 21 years or older to adopt from STAF.\n\u2022  We require a 4-foot-tall physical fence for homes with children under the age of 11. We also may require a physical fence for specific dogs on a case-by-case basis, depending on each dog\u2019s behavior and exercise needs.\n\u2022  Due in part to increasing coyote activity/incidents in the area and the difficulty of predicting how a dog will respond to invisible fence training, we can not adopt to homes with invisible fences.\n\u2022  We do request vet and personal references.\n\u2022  We can facilitate adoptions within a 75-mile radius of our Cincinnati-based shelter.\n\n",

Hope was being abused by children and grown men dragging her around by a motorcycle, and slamming her tail in doors . Sadly her tail had to be amputated! From the abuse Hope suffered she was left with a neurological issue where when she walks her back foot knuckles, so she needs a wrap for her foot when walking or playing to hold the foot in place to not cause further injury. Hope is approximately 120 lbs and a very tall leggy girl , that craves love and attention , she does well with Large calm male dogs , she does not like cats and will chase them.  Hope can be mouthy when excited so we suggest no small children due to her size, Hope is crate trained, housebroke and leash trained, and would do best in a home with no steps and a large fenced yard for exercise ! Hopes dream is to find a family worthy of all the Dane love she has to share & accommodate her needs to live a happy healthy life.

He really likes going on walks and still needs work on pulling less on a leash but he is a smart dog who will be excited to learn. Lucky is a cuddler! He loves to be touched and enjoys being as close to you as he possibly can. Lucky will always receive you with a big smile and a waggy tail. He is also active and enjoys walking and running, but he wouldn\u2019t complain on a lazy Sunday where he could snuggle with you.\n\n Lucky is looking for a forever home, please contact Maria at 786-205-6865",

She is currently living with her bff, Ben. She would really love to be someone's hiking buddy. Holly is good with large male dogs and older kids. No cats or small animals. Holly is house trained and ready to find her new home.\n\nPlease email us at AlmostHome4Dogs@yahoo.com to find out if Holly is the right one for you! (Local adoptions preferred - Philadelphia and tri-state area [South Jersey and northern Delaware] only.)\n\nPLEASE READ BEFORE CONTACTING US!\nWe are NOT a shelter: All of our dogs live in private homes with foster families. Come and meet the Almost Home dogs and their fosters at our Meet & Greet events, where you can learn more about our wonderful dogs from the people who live with them, find out which dogs are on their way and when they'll arrive, and fill out an application to adopt or foster.\n\nWe cannot adopt to homes where electric-shock fencing systems or training collars are used. For more information on the dangers of electric-shock collars, please visit banshockcollars.ca/studies.php and http://www.hollysden.com/say_no_to_shock.htm (scroll down and click on the \"Invisible Fencing Systems\" link).\n\nWe do not have an online adoption application; to request an application, e-mail us at AlmostHome4Dogs@yahoo.com. To speed e-mail processing time, be sure to note the name of the dog you are inquiring about in the Subject line. For Meet & Greet times and locations, visit our home page, where you also will find information on our adoption process and fees.\n\nFOSTER FAMILIES ARE LIFESAVERS!! Can you open your heart and home for a few weeks to homeless shelter dog? Remember, by fostering a dog, you save TWO lives - that of your foster dog, and that of the dog who takes his place in the shelter! Come to a Meet & Greet and find out if fostering is for you - there's no reward quite like the feeling that you've saved a life ... or two!",

I'm not as good at stairs as I was in my younger days so it's safest that I don't attempt them without some hooman assistance but I would prefer to avoid them altogether. If you think you might like some snuggles and you have a house full of things for me to smell then send my friends a message at adoption@lynchburghumane.org and let them know you'd like to meet me!",

            "description": "My name is Kenai and I'm 3 years old. I love to spend time running and playing outside, so I'm looking for a family that will be able to keep up with me.  People have told me that I'm smart and that I'm a quick learner. I know a couple commands but could use a little help working on my manners.  I spend time in the adoption coordinators office and when she's on the phone I walk over and rearrange her desk for her.  So she put \"work on manners\" on my New Years resolution list.  I love to eat treats in a kong and I carry it around in my mouth. I can be a little snappy when I take the treat though.    I can be very dog selective, so possibly best without other dogs in the home.  I have met some  kids and done well, but because I am a big guy, and am working on my manners should probably have older kids (16+) in the home.  I hope to meet my new family soon!\nGerman Shepherd experience would also be an added bonus. \n\nD.O.B 3/30/17\n\nMeet-Your-Match Canine-ality color is: Orange Busy Bee!!!\nFor safety's sake, we are looking for homes with physical fenced in areas.\nPlease fill out our online adoption survey at www.mackenzies.info",

Soon after she gave birth to her puppies, sadly each one passed away. Once the rescue found out her puppies died they no longer wanted to rescue sweet Margie. So they asked AWS if we would take her. Of course we would! We welcomed Margie with open arms! Margie had an undiagnosed case of Mange and our vet thinks that's why her puppies perished. Margie wasn\u2019t socialized with people as a puppy so she is leary of strangers. With time, patience & love Margie is learning to trust the staff and volunteers at AWS. She doesn\u2019t give it up easily, you must earn her trust.  \nMargie is full grown at 35 pounds.  She would do best in a adult home with another dog to help show her the ropes and what its like to be a real dog. She is very under socialized and at this time does not like to interact with people. Margie requires a home with a fenced in yard. \n\n\nFor more information on Margie, call AWS at 860-354-1350 email animalwelfare.socty@snet.net or visit our website aws-shelter.org for a pre adopt application. Adoption fees for Dogs (8yrs and up) is $150  Adult Dogs is $350 and Puppies under a year is $400 .",

He was dumped over our fence and was so scared. \nOnce we earned his trust, now we have a best buddy.\nHe loves his pool time and will sit perfectly for a treat.\n\n\nWe are only scheduling appointments for approved adopters at this time!\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our pets please fill out the application at http://www.sunnymeadows.org and if you are approved to adopt, we will set up a time for you to come and meet the pet.\nThank you for your patience. Due to changes in our adoption policies the process can take a few weeks.\nWe receive multiple applications on some pets and we thoroughly review each one to find the very best home for each pet in our care.\n\nWe do require a fenced in yard, previous pet ownership with vet references. All of our requirements can be found on our website. www.sunnymeadows.org",

            "description": "Please contact Vivienne (viviennejames@comcast.net) for more information about this pet.Weaver is a little love bug that has a tender spot for ear rubs. He is 3 years old and weighs about 28 lbs. Weaver would do best in a home without children, as he isn't fond of loud noises and wants to just hang out with his people. He loves to play with other dogs, no matter the size. He has played excellently with his 70 pound foster brother and his smallest 20 pound foster brother. Weaver does get a little overwhelmed with too many dogs, so 2 or less siblings would most likely suit him best. He is very attentive to his people and is always ready to be on the move with where they go next. He doesn't HAVE to be crated when left alone, but he is crate trained and will go there to rest on occasion. He is nervous of strangers at first interaction, but with some patience and love he comes right out of his shell! He enjoys hanging around outside to explore, so a large yard would be great for him. He'd stay outside all day if I let him, unless it's raining. Weaver also walks great on a leash! He tries to gobble his food very quickly, so I'd recommend anyone interested to have a slow feed bowl ready for him No children. Weaver is neutered, current on all his shots and microchipped. To be considered for his forever home please contact Vivienne at viviennejames@comcast.net or 615-943-7311. APPROVED APPLICATION AND ADOPTION FEE REQUIRED.",

A farm lady called the local animal control to come get him before he starved to death. She would throw cow parts for him to eat to try to keep him alive. He had to be trapped by animal control because he was so afraid. He is doing well in his foster's home and loves their other dogs. He would do best in a calm home with other dogs to show him the ropes. Austin will come around but will need a family who is patient and will give him the time he needs to figure out that people aren't so bad. If you are that special family, please consider giving him the loving, permanent home that he deserves",

Now that I don't have to worry about my babies I'm looking for a forever home. \n\nI've never known what its like to have snuggles with someone, or trust a person before entering foster care. My foster mom gave me a little time and eventually I warmed up to her and now I enjoy snuggling in bed, playing with her dogs and I REALLY REALLY LOVE peanut butter! To think that my whole life could have passed by without the joy of peanut butter... \n\nWhen looking for a home I'd like a family that will understand that I've been through some scary things. I'm not aggressive at all, just a little shy and I like to hang back until I feel safe. I came from a hoarder house in Texas and lived my entire life in a mess of other dogs. Being a part of a family will make me very happy. Especially if I can find someone who is gentle, not too chaotic, calming and loves to cuddle.",

This darling girl was a last chance for life dog in Texas, so not much is known about her past. Canela is estimated to be a little under a year old (as of August 2020), and we believe she is a Greyhound/Doberman type mix. She is kind to everyone she has met so far, and will make a lucky family an incredible dog. Canela arrived in Washington on July 11, 2020, she is currently in foster care working on leash skills, basic obedience, and crate training. She is quiet in her crate, and will go right in for a treat. She is a volunteer and staff favorite due to her kind, happy nature. She is very willing to learn... she wants to please! In her doggie playgroup, Canela is with a variety of sizes and personalities and gets along well with everyone. She is good with all the other dogs she has met while with us. While it doesn't get her down in any ways, She has deformed feet and is missing an eye so an adopter with a great vet reference is a must. She doesn\u2019t let her differences slow her down.

Our veterinary partner estimates that Zach is 2 months old at the time of intake in May 2020.\n\nThis poor little guy is the victim of a backyard breeder who simply tossed him in the trash after he was deemed to be defective merchandise.\n\nZach was born with partial cerebellar hypoplasia which causes him to be off balance. He bumps into things, but he doesn't really care! Zach requires a small yard so he doesn't run to the point of exhaustion and would do best in a quiet household with a playful, tolerant doggy sibling and no young children.\nTraining Zach may be a challenge, as he may stick with some of his puppy tendencies forever.\nHe will need a patient and loving family to help him live his life with extra special care for the rest of his days.\n\nZach is a young pup who is good with people of all ages and other dogs.\n\nHe is a rock star to Rescue Dogs Rock NYC, and we know that very special family is out there waiting to find him. If you would like to adopt this very sweet boy, please apply online at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

She and her brother Sputnik came to us from rough stray conditions and are still in need of a little extra love. She is very affectionate and trusting and is always patient with us when we give her baths. She is cuddly and loves pets, she has an awesome smile that she greets everyone with. She needs a committed and experienced adopter who will proactively work with her leash reactivity and dog selectivity, and will thrive in a low-density area where she has lots of room to run and roam. She is an awesome, active girl looking for her forever home!",

She is a shy gal in her kennel and at first. It takes her a while to warm up in new situations and people. Once comfortable Baby Girl enjoys attention from anyone she loves. This lady came to the shelter because she got into a fight with another dog causing a bite to the other dog. In the kennel area Baby Girl does not react to other dogs but face to face she is not so friendly. We are asking that she goes to a home with no other dogs. This gal needs an experienced owner who knows she cannot go to the dog park, who knows she may be difficult to walk and who knows she should not be left alone outside. Please contact the behavior department with any questions. We are also asking that she goes to a home with no kids due to her selective personality. It is recommended that she goes to a home without cats as well due to aggression towards other animals seen at the shelter. \n\nMust have a 6 foot fence and schedule an appointment with a trainer before an adoption can be finalized.

            "description": "Sammy came to us after his mom could no longer care for her due to her own health issues. It was an upsetting situation for all but she found comfort knowing that her little baby would be safe and sound with a new forever family.\nHere is what is foster mom has to say about our little Sammy:\n\"Sammy is a sweet old man, with a little quirk. He does not like it when someone reaches out to pet or touch him. His lets you know this by giving a bark. He does like to cuddle, just on his own terms. He loves when his person lays on the floor so he can come to them for his pets. Once his person is on the floor, he will lay next to them and nuzzle, and allow petting and touching.\nOddly, he allows me to pick him up with no issues. He does not jump up on furniture, and doesn't seem to enjoy sitting on the couch with you (when he's picked up and placed up there). He will play with toys as long as you're willing to play with him.\nSammy is a Velcro dog. He wants to be near his person at all times. He likes to be right at your feet. If you get up, he will also get up to follow you. He sleeps in his open crate (in an enclosed area) through the night. He has no issues with eating and easily takes his medications twice a day in pill pockets. He is potty trained, but it took a few days for him to understand where it was, and wasn't, ok to go.\nSammy has some pain and mobility issues. A house with no stairs would most likely be best for him. The vet has him taking medications twice a day to help with pain.\nHe's a very good boy that seems to get along with all people and dogs. He just needs someone who understands the perils of growing old, and who's willing to take care of his medical and medication needs.\"\n\n\n",

Maggie is a sweet girl who gets along with people and other dogs. We do not know what she thinks of cats. This pretty girl still has some puppy energy and would love a family to go hike or do things with as well as continue some more consistent basic training. Her energy may be too much for young/small children. Maggie is about 2-3 years old and 45 pounds. Please help Maggie find the loving home she deserves.\n\nWe do NOT ship our animals. All adoptive families must travel to us to meet their adoptive dog/cat. Applicants must live within a 2 hour radius from Sparta/Andover (07871/07821).\n\nPlease understand that we are an animal shelter and thus unable to say whether the dogs are housebroken as they are not in homes.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, we encourage you to please submit an application on our website today so that we can try and process and pre-approve any potential adopters prior to our next adoption event.\n\nPLEASE USE THIS LINK TO SUBMIT AN ADOPTION APPLICATION. WE ONLY ACCEPT ADOPTION APPLICATIONS THROUGH OUR WEBSITE. ANY OTHERS WILL NOT BE PROCESSED.\nApplication link here: http://www.oscaranimalrescue.org/oscar-1-application.html\n\nAdoption Process:\n1.Fill out an application\n2.Meet & Greet\n3.Adoption contract & adoption fee\nMaggie's adoption fee is $325. This also covers all age-appropriate shots, spay/neuter, vetting & microchipping.\n\n**If you are coming to an adoption event to see a certain dog/cat, please email ahead of time to make sure that dog/cat will be there that day. Please email 1-2 days before the event, as some animals are placed during the week and our list is constantly changing.\nFor a list of upcoming pet adoption events go to: www.OscarAnimalRescue.org\n\nOne Step Closer Animal Rescue is a 501c3 non-profit organization.

Her owner has faced some lifestyle changes that no longer allow her to care for Carly. Carly is a friendly, loving, energetic girl who would love a yard to play in - or at least a lot of exercise every day - and a human to hang out with most of the time. She loves long walks, but can help you work from home, as well. She is great with people, but a bit excitable around children, so we recommend older children only. Carly would love a sibling to play with, someone around her size is best. Carly is about 3 years old, approximately 40 lbs, and up to date on vaccines. If you are looking for a best friend, Carly is your girl! If you would like to adopt Carly, please put your application in here:\nhttp://www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org",

After no owner came forward she became part of the SOS family on July 9th. Freedom is a very smart girl who in a few short days is already responding very well to her training. She is great with dogs of all sizes but tends to take on the role of the \u201cFun Police\u201d if the energy gets too high. She is currently recovering from kennel cough and awaiting spay surgery. After that she will be looking for her forever home in a structured, somewhat calm home. Would be a great dog for an active veteran/person who is looking for a loyal companion.",

My friends say that I am a friendly dude who enjoys playing with dog friends, taking naps, going for walkies, hanging out with my human friends, and consuming large quantities of Easy Cheese! I am a smart boy who is housebroken and crate trained and I know (and listen) to a lot of commands, too! I've been spending some time in my Pet Partner's home and she says that I am an excellent house guest because I am such a good mix of fun and chill. I like to play with my doggy foster siblings and go for walks, but I also like to take naps on my bed. Apparently it is pretty cool that I sleep in my crate throughout the night without making a peep AND that I am a good boy about going to the bathroom outside, too. I am looking for a low traffic, adult only home with no cats, but I would enjoy calm, friendly doggy siblings. My Pet Partner has done a lot of training with me during my time at PAWS and she would love to help me find the right home (Basically, I think she is just looking for any excuse to brag about how handsome and awesome I am. But seriously, who could blame her?). Anyone interested in more information or potentially adopting me should contact PAWS at dogs@centrecountypaws.org.",

He is likely to be around 35-40 lbs once fully grown. \n\nHe is very fearful when meeting new people so anyone that meets him needs to take things slow.  Tivon walks well on leash and shows no fear at all. He is super chill and loves to cuddle. He can be a bit clingy and loves people so he will do well as an only dog since he is super confident now and is able to go on walks on his own. When in the privacy of a secure yard though, he loves to run around and play so a playful dog companion would be great for him too. He is flexible. He is still not fond of his crate though so his adopter will need to work with him on this a bit.\n\nINTERESTED IN THIS PUP?

Dogs in the PURPLE category are very shy and will need equally patient adopters that have experience in confidence building. Dogs in the PURPLE category may also benefit from having another confident canine in the home.\n\nDogs are assigned to color categories using any previous owner notes, general handling, as well as staff and volunteer observations. As we continue to get to know the dogs and gather further insights into their personalities, colors may be adjusted accordingly.\n\nRancho Coastal Humane Society remains temporarily closed to the general public, but we have companion animals in our care that are ready for adoption BY APPOINTMENT ONLY, and our staff is ready to make that happen! Please visit our website for updates and more information. Thank you for your interest.\n\nAdoption Hours: Wednesday\u2013Monday; 11 AM to 4:30 PM (Closed Tuesdays)\n\nAddress: 389 Requeza Street, Encinitas, CA 92024\n\n\n\n\n",

            "description": "My name is Thunderbolt! I'm a 10 year old beagle and I'm currently weighing in at 26 pounds. I'm still trying to adjust to the indoor life and understand how I'm supposed to be a pet dog. You see, my entire life I have lived outdoors in a pen with only an igloo and had never seen a vet. I'm told I have some health issues starting with being diagnosed Heartworm positive Stage 2, have slight arrhythmia, an ear infection and my mouth hurts. The only good part of my teeth hurting is that I get only soft dog food and soft treats. I'm really getting used to sleeping the day away in the dog bed I have picked out and also started sleeping in the human's bed between them. I can sleep the entire night away - no worries there! I love simply being touched and petted and really like being near you, even though I'm still unsure what all this means.\n\nHere's a little info: I am not house trained but I am crate trained. I enjoy being around other dogs - it's kind of crazy at my foster house because I've been around 7 other dogs and we all like each other. I really just kind of observe them and every once in a while I'll follow them. If anyone goes to the kitchen - I manage to get myself up pretty quick to see if I can get some food or at least some crumbs. I'm just starting to learn about being held and sitting in a lap, not too sure about all that yet. With a little more time I might be alright with the idea.\n\nI still have to be neutered and I have to go through heartworm treatment because no one cared enough about me to give me a monthly prevent. Give me some time to heal and I will be ready to go home with you. Let's go ahead and mark our calendars and pencil me in for mid-November/early December. I'll wait for you if you wait for me.\n\nI would love to meet my new family soon, I've been waiting for you. If you would like to meet me, please submit an adoption application for me today!\n\nThank you for checking out my bio, please check back for an update. My life was saved recently and we are getting me safe and warm. Information will be updated as soon as I get settled in at my foster home.\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online at http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.\n\n*Some of our animals receive a high volume of applications, and we strive to select the best home for each animal. However, we have many wonderful homeless pets available.",

I even like taking a run when it\u2019s not too hot in the Texas heat. I do great with dogs when I am in public but I don\u2019t do so well with dogs or cats in my own space. I tend to get a bit territorial. I love humans and am extremely sweet and handsome. I\u2019m a big lug who just wants love and affection in a steady home. I\u2019m two years old and was found as a stray. I am now looking for a forever home.\n\nPlease visit www.txpyrs.org for more information and to fill out an application.\n\nTexas Great Pyrenees Rescue, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to Great Pyrenees.

His Kentucky rescue angels found him and reached out for rescue for him and how could we resist that face?!? He is approximately 8 years old and is all vetted now. Charlie is great with all other dogs. He is the happiest dog ever at the clinic with is tail wagging non-stop at all of the attention and new friends he is meeting. Charlie will move to his northern Illinois foster home on 7/25. Please check back for more information and pictures of this adorable boy!!MEDICAL UPDATE: Charlie tested heartworm positive. He will start on pre-treatment medications right away and and his foster family will get him through treatment. 10/14 UPDATE: Charlie had his first heartworm treatment injection and did great! He will relax at home for 30 days then go back for the second round of injections. Please keep him in your thoughts and prayers!",

            "description": "Adoption Fee:  $150\nFostered in Baton Rouge, Louisiana\nAge: 10 years\nWeight: 5.4 lbs.\n\n12/15/20 - Blitzen had a recheck for his ear and other than an ear infection which is being treated, he seems to be healing quite nicely.  Also, the results came back and the mass was benign.  Yay!\n\nThe doctor did find that his thyroid levels were off, so started Blitzen on Thyroxine, 1 mg. - 1/2 pill twice daily.  He is now feeling great!\n\n11/28/20 - Blitzen had his surgery yesterday to remove the tumor in his right ear.  The mass was sent to the lab.  He is doing well.  He has a recheck scheduled for December 10th.  Thank you so much for your prayers and donations for sweet little Blitzen and he hopes everyone had a Happy Thanksgiving.\n\n11/19/20 - Blitzen saw the specialist today at MedVet Mandeville for his ear.  His appointment was originally set for October 29th, but had to be cancelled because of the weather at that time.  He is scheduled for November 27 to have the tumor(s) removed and biopsied.  The estimate for his surgery is $1,741.59.  Please help with his surgery cost if you can and say prayers that everything goes well.\n\nThank you.\n\n10/26/20 - Blitzen's consultation with the specialist is Thursday, 10/29/20.  We will update after this appt.\n\n10/25/20 - Blitzen's foster mom has notice that his ears have been having a foul order and bothering him so she had them look into this today while he was under anesthesia being neutered.  It seems this poor baby has a 2 tumors down in his ear that need to be removed.  We are scheduling an appointment with a specialist at MedVet to have this done soon.\n\nPlease keep him in your prayers.\n\n7/26/20 \u2013 Hi, it\u2019s me, Blitzen again checking in.  Foster mom has found out that even though they named me Blitzen, (after a reindeer since my legs are a little longer), you can pretty much call me whatever you want since I can\u2019t hear.  Yep, I\u2019m pretty deaf.  Don\u2019t feel sorry for me though, I think this is a real advantage.  You know how you have those annoying siblings, parents, and friends that talk too much or too loud and you wish they would just hush?  You know where I\u2019m going with this don\u2019t you? Lol  I cannot hear them.  ?  The down side is I can\u2019t hear the ones I truly love.  But I can look at you adoringly and watch you speak to me and wag my tail.\n\nNow, I can see, love, eat, play and everything else a normal dog can do.  One thing I am great at right now is humping my bed.  Yea, I know, not the most attractive thing, but we are all hoping that once I get neutered and some of these male hormones are gone, I won\u2019t want to molest my blankets and bedding.  The good thing is that I don\u2019t do that to my fur-siblings or anything else. \n\nThe vet said that I can be neutered and get my dental as soon as I put a little more weight on.  Seems I was pretty much on the anorexic side when I got here and apparently that isn\u2019t the \u201cin\u201d look any longer.  \n\nI sleep good and eat my food like a champ (hard food mixed with a little water).  However, it seems I must have been given table scraps before because I am GREAT at begging.  I\u2019m learning that these people aren\u2019t as free with their food as the last people.  Well, I\u2019m in a great home now, so I\u2019ll learn to accept that.\n\nCurrently, I am an unaltered male, so I am marking, but foster mom has me wearing a belly band so I won\u2019t mess up all the furniture.  Is that crazy?  A man of my age wearing a diaper!!  Oh well, who am I to fuss about it.  I\u2019d much rather be here than where I came from.  Foster mom says that the marking will get better once I\u2019m neutered.  Boy, getting neutered around here at this rescue seems to be a huge thing.    They are smart people, so it must be the thing to do.  No one else til now seemed to care, so I\u2019m grateful.\n\nAre you in the market for an older reindeer that does take naps, but still has energy, and is a sweetheart?  Well, stop right here, because Blitzen can be that man.\n\n7/21/20 - Milo is settling into his foster home and we will post a bio soon updating on his medical status and personality.\n\n7/13/20 - Yet another baby in desperate need of vetting, love, food and rescue.  A rescue friend contacted Yorkie Haven to see if we could help this poor baby.   Blitzen, as he is now called, was definitely in bad shape when we picked him up on Friday.  We went straight to the vet just to address the obvious issues, skin, ears, eyes, nail clip.  No matter that long nails are in for humans, they are NEVER in for dogs.\n\nSweet Blitzen received some ear medication and medicated shampoo.  As soon as he got home, they wild hair was cut off and he received his first soothing, medicated shampoo and massage.  He enjoyed it and the dirt that came off of him was ridiculous.  He felt better after getting out of the tub.  He ate supper like a champ.  You would too if you hip and back bones and ribs were poking out.  He had a very long, exhausting day and slept like a log.  Despite it all, Blitzen is a very resilient, happy boy.  We can't wait to see what he looks like in the weeks/months to come.  \n\nSoon he will be neutered, get a much needed dental, receive his shots and get a microchip.  It's all uphill from here Blitzen  Don't look back and try to forget your past because the best is yet to come.",

He is a young, strong, playful and loving Springer who is just finishing up his heartworm treatment.\n\nIn foster care, he has learned to sit on command and greet his foster mom with four paws on the floor. He does tend to be rough on bedding and pull out the stuffing, so he\u2019d probably appreciate some more appropriate chew toys. Panda was an outside dog before rescue and is enjoying the great indoors these days. He is a good snuggler and a good watchdog. He seems to get along well with dog-savvy cats.\n\nHe will need an active adult family, dedicated to additional training, and a fenced yard. Because of the COVID 19 pandemic, Panda has not had many opportunities to get out and about. He is a strong boy who pulls on his leash and needs some practice meeting new people. He is smart and trainable and might excel at an active canine sport like agility. He has lots of energy and would make a willing jogging partner.",

This sweet, affectionate boy loves his human friends and wants to be close to them all day long. He's totally up for going on adventures, but he's just as happy to chill out at home, too, snoozing quietly on the couch or floor near his people. Leash walking is a new experience for this big boy, but this very smart dude is learning fast, becoming a fantastic walking, running and hiking buddy who loves long walks, wanting to greet every person he meets. And he's learning what 'sit' and 'lay' mean. In his foster home, he's happy to play-bow with his doggy housemate. And he's a house-trained boy who doesn't mind sleeping in his crate. Turner hopes for a home where he can be interacting with his people, going on adventures, and snoozing with them. Come take this wiggly boy for a walk. He'll follow you right home!",

            "description": "Date of birth: 5/9/2018\n\n1/20/2021: Redmond is a cute American Staffordshire Terrier mix! He\u2019s 2 years old and weighs 66 lbs. He\u2019s playful and silly and lots of fun-- and he loves playing in the kiddie pool! \n\n\u2022 Redmond is very friendly and loves people. He also loves treats and is very food motivated. Redmond needs some work on his manners and plays a bit rough, so he\u2019ll need a home without young kids.  \n\n\u2022 Redmond gets along with some but not all dogs. He\u2019s played nicely with some dogs in the yard here but we\u2019ve found that it needs to be the right dog for it to work well. It would need to be another playful good natured dog who wouldn\u2019t let Redmond get away with too much! If you have a dog who might be a good match for Redmond, you could bring your dog to meet Redmond to see if they could be buddies. \n\n\u2022 Redmond is not good with cats and must have a home without cats.\n\n\u2022 We\u2019d like to find Redmond a home with someone who has dog experience and knows how to work with a dog with some leash reactivity. Redmond can be leash reactive with some other dogs. A home with a wooden fence that\u2019s fairly tall would be ideal.\n\n\u2022 Unfortunately, Redmond tested positive fore heartworms. He\u2019s had his first heartworm treatment already. He\u2019ll need to keep to limited activity for the next several weeks while in the treatment phase, then he\u2019ll be able to run and play like normal.  The treatments are done in our clinic and at no extra cost.  We can fill you in on his treatment plan if you are interested in fostering or adopting him.  \n\n\u2022 Redmond was found as a stray and the poor guy had several lacerations on his nose and under his armpits. We\u2019re not sure what caused them. He\u2019s healed up now. He\u2019s also been neutered, vaccinated and microchipped.\n\n\u2022 He\u2019ll be a good match for someone wanting an active, fun dog who\u2019s a bit of a diamond in the \u201cruff\u201d! \n\nMORE ON ADOPTING OUR DOGS... \n\n> COVID-19 UPDATE:  PLEASE SUBMIT AN ONLINE ADOPTION APPLICATION AND A MEMBER OF OUR ADOPTIONS TEAM WILL REACH OUT TO YOU.  Please visit our web site at HSGKC.ORG for an adoption application, our current COVID-19 adoption protocol, and other adoption info.\u00a0\n\n> If you decide you'd like to adopt one of the pets you meet, we reserve the pet for you but we generally don't send the pet home with you that day. We\u2019ll instead schedule a pick up date and time that\u2019s convenient for you.\u00a0  \n\n> Our goal is to send you home with a healthy pet and any information and support you may need to help your new pet adjust to his or her new home.  All of our dogs & puppies have been spayed or neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, treated for fleas & ticks, tested for heartworms (7 mo. and over), and are on monthly heartworm preventative. Puppies who are too young to receive all the necessary puppy boosters and/or first rabies shot may be brought back to us for those vaccines at no extra charge. You will also receive a leash, collar, coupons for pet supplies and services, toys, and educational materials. And we'll give your dog a bath before he or she goes home! \n\n> Please note that we prefer and may require a fenced yard for many of our dogs.  Exceptions are made on an individual basis depending on the dog's needs, the person's dog experience, the dog's and person's activity levels, home environment and other factors. \n\nThank you for searching for a shelter pet!\n\nDog Adoption Contact Info:\nEmail: christine@hsgkc.org\nPhone: 913.521.2339\nhttp://hsgkc.org",

He was found as an abandoned boy who was emaciated and suffering from an infestation of ticks & fleas on top of other skin issues. He is now a VERY healthy and gorgeous boy!  He is MOUTHY boy in that he loves 'to play with his mouth and large paws'. General has a loud bellowing voice to alert you to cars in the driveway/visitors but quiets down quickly if consoled that 'it's a welcome visitor!' He has some PTSD from previous abuse so a slow approach helps him to meet strangers [EX : don't run up an hug him, best to sit and extend a hand]. We recommend an experienced owner, and due to his large size, no young children. He is fine with non-aggressive other dog[s] as he LOVES to play. He is neutered, HW- & on preventatives, UTD on rabies and all of his shots!",

Unfortunately, Jacqui developed Immune Mediated Polyarthritis (IMPA), an auto-immune disorder causing painful swollen joints.  Since June she has been going through medical treatment and is doing much better. Jacqui is now looking for that special person to call her own and give her the love and caring that she needs.  Please email uafdogs20@gmail.com to get more information on her condition and the care she will require.  Jacqui will need a home without others pets and a secure fenced yard. \n\n\nOur adoption fee of $150.00 helps cover expenses (vaccinations, spay/neuter, food, housing) for the homeless pets we rescue.  UAF does not ship our adoptables out of state and to ensure the best fit, UAF conducts a home visit to meet other pets and verify a safe, secure yard.\n\nTo start the process of adopting this dog or any other dog, please fill out our matchmaking form which can be accessed by copying the following address and pasting it into your browser.  Filling out this form does not obligate you to adopt.\n\nhttps://www.unitedanimalfriends.org/index.php?option=com_rsform&view=rsform&formId=2\n\nPlease email uafdogs20@gmail.com to learn more about this dog.",

Daphne is lovely to walk on a leash and would enjoy a nice couch and household to relax in...she is pretty medium energy so if you are looking for a GShep who isn't quite so high energy, she is your lady!

I\u2019m a very handsome guy, always ready to flash you one of my \u201csignature\u201d smiles. While I may be a little shy meeting some new people, a couple of treats is all it takes to become great friends. I am also pretty smart, and ready to learn more. I am very affectionate and a real cuddler. At night, I sleep deeply and snore loudly I\u2019m told. This just means that I had an active day filled with a lot of loving and play time.",

He is a busy, active boy that's always ready for an adventure. He loves hanging out with his humans and is a great walking/hiking buddy.  He's very playful with other dogs and enjoys car rides!  Finn will do best in a home with a female or non-dominant male dog that likes to play.  He will need a home with no cats and no children.\n\nFinn shows anxiety in certain situations, so he was lucky enough to train with Loyal Companion K9 Academy to help set him up for future success.  He's looking for an active home that will continue with his training and understand his need for a predictable routine and consistent exercise.\n\nFinn is neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines.  He is house trained and crate trained.  His adoption fee is $350.  For the chance to adopt Finn, please complete an application at happytailsaz.org.",

Billie Jean was rescued from Texas from overcrowded shelter.. she does have some neurological issues that the neurologist feels came from blunt force trauma... but she\u2019s so amazingly sweet dispute what has happened to her.. She is in foster with another dog so we feel she would do best in a home with a big dog to help her as she loves to play with them and it helps her with her neurological issues... she does circle at times and seems to get very excited at feeding time but it\u2019s all due to the neurological issues.. Billie Jean would do best in a home that has patience.. no little kids would be best.. but 10 and over is fine.. she loves to run in the backyard so a fenced in yard is best as long walks can be difficult for her at times.   \n\nCould you be the one to offer this special sweetheart a loving forever home ???

Oreo is a fantastic dog, he just needs the right and understanding people! we feel Oreo would do best as an only dog and in a home without small kids due to his strength. \nOreo is fixed, microchipped, up to date on shots, has been dewormed, has had a fecal, is heartworm negative and is on flea and heartworm preventative. if interested in Oreo, please email me at ayurcisin27@yahoo.com\nthank you!",

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: 07/03/20\nReason for being in rescue: Owner release/owner was evicted\nFoster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SC\nSpecial Needs? None noted\n\nWeight: 25 lbs\nHeight: 18 in\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $200\n\nFence needed? No, but he would love to be able to fun in a fenced yard.\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Murphy is a family dog. He previously lived with 2 smaller dogs. He would absolutely like to have buddies in his home, but if the owner had time for him he could be an only dog. Murphy can be timid. He doesn't know much about being a pet. He needs a patient, experienced family that can show him the ropes of family life. Murphy is indifferent to cats.\n\nWhat is my personality like? Murphy is a great dog who's had little experience in his short life. His young world has been turned upside down, he lost his home for no reason except his human ran into financial issues and couldn't keep her dog family. He does want to connect with people and will shyly look at you once he trusts you.\n\nWhen you first meet Murphy, he is cautious but becomes friendly. He needs a little time to get to know you, then he desires being petted. Murphy is not happy in his crate and we believe his previous owner didn't crate train him. He will pant and drool and become incredibly stressed when he is crated. He is not a dog that can be left alone for long amounts of time during the day. He needs a lifestyle with a family where someone is home more than they are away.\n\nWe don't know about Murphy's interaction with children. He is happy and willing to work for a treat. We expect that he would be happy with mature children that are patient with him and give him time to warm up. Murphy does okay on a leash, he still needs work on his leash manners. Murphy is highly treat and food motivated and will absolutely work for treats. He has so much potential!\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Cautious, then will warm up to you.\n\nOther tips and tidbits: Murphy's estimated birthday is 6/24/18\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

Our mission: To balance the health, safety, and welfare needs of Boxers in the Carolinas (and parts of Virginia and Georgia) by providing a loving and safe environment for stray, abused, impounded and owner surrendered dogs by placing them in foster homes and ultimately - forever homes.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDog's Name: Karma\n\nDog's Approximate Age: 6 years\n\nGender: Female\n\nDog's Size: Medium (50lbs to 70lbs. as adult and healthy weight)\n\nDog's Weight: Don't know yet\n\nGood with small dogs?: Yes\n\nGood with big dogs?: Yes\n\nGood with cats?: Yes\n\nGood with kids?: Yes, all ages\n\nAny medical issues?: Karma is currently being monitored by the vet for joint discomfort.\n\nCrate trained?: Yes\n\nHouse trained?: Yes\n\nHeartworms?: No\n\n7/19/20: Hello everyone!! My name is Karma, and I'm a big snuggle bug! I have fallen in love with the couch at my new foster mom's house. She puts blankets down for me to curl up on, and I love it! I also love to lay in the sun during the early mornings before it gets too hot outside. The family has another Boxer who is all full of energy and he keeps bringing me toys to play with, but I'd rather snuggle and give kisses. I keep eyeballing the beds, but right now they are too high for me to climb up on, so my foster mom said she's got a plan that will allow me to get up on the beds. I can't wait to cuddle at night with the little people in the house. Right now one of the little people sleeps in the living room with me so I'm not alone at night. It's kinda nice having her there with me to keep me company. I've been here since Sunday and have made sure to not have any accidents or chew anything that I'm not supposed to :-) My foster mom says I'm SUCH a good girl because she doesn't have to crate me when she goes to the store. One of the things that I really love is to watch the lizard and the bunnies that are here. One bunny even kisses me on the nose. They are so fun to watch! My foster family has a cat too, but she's not very exciting. She just stares at me, but thankfully she doesn't seem to mind that I'm here for a bit. I have a really awesome sponsor named Erin Simpson that sent me goodies in the mail and another person who made me a really awesome blanket that's all mine! I'm super spoiled and getting lots of love and affection. So far I've made two trips to the vet for check ups and I have to say, car rides are pretty fun! My foster mom gets me french fries after my vet appointments which are super yummy! I can't wait to have a place to call my home and a family to claim as mine :-) I'm SO thankful Carolina Boxer Rescue came and rescued me because now I feel like a princess that's loved :-)\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCome visit carolinaboxerrescue.org to learn more about me and see more pictures.

            "description": "Carolina Boxer Rescue is a volunteer run, 501(c)3 non-profit organization. Our mission: To balance the health, safety, and welfare needs of Boxers in the Carolinas (and parts of Virginia and Georgia) by providing a loving and safe environment for stray, abused, impounded and owner surrendered dogs by placing them in foster homes and ultimately - forever homes.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDog's Name: Karma\n\nDog's Approximate Age: 6 years\n\nGender: Female\n\nDog's Size: Medium (50lbs to 70lbs. as adult and healthy weight)\n\nDog's Weight: Don't know yet\n\nGood with small dogs?: Yes\n\nGood with big dogs?: Yes\n\nGood with cats?: Yes\n\nGood with kids?: Yes, all ages\n\nAny medical issues?: Karma is currently being monitored by the vet for joint discomfort.\n\nCrate trained?: Yes\n\nHouse trained?: Yes\n\nHeartworms?: No\n\n7/19/20: Hello everyone!! My name is Karma, and I'm a big snuggle bug! I have fallen in love with the couch at my new foster mom's house. She puts blankets down for me to curl up on, and I love it! I also love to lay in the sun during the early mornings before it gets too hot outside. The family has another Boxer who is all full of energy and he keeps bringing me toys to play with, but I'd rather snuggle and give kisses. I keep eyeballing the beds, but right now they are too high for me to climb up on, so my foster mom said she's got a plan that will allow me to get up on the beds. I can't wait to cuddle at night with the little people in the house. Right now one of the little people sleeps in the living room with me so I'm not alone at night. It's kinda nice having her there with me to keep me company. I've been here since Sunday and have made sure to not have any accidents or chew anything that I'm not supposed to :-) My foster mom says I'm SUCH a good girl because she doesn't have to crate me when she goes to the store. One of the things that I really love is to watch the lizard and the bunnies that are here. One bunny even kisses me on the nose. They are so fun to watch! My foster family has a cat too, but she's not very exciting. She just stares at me, but thankfully she doesn't seem to mind that I'm here for a bit. I have a really awesome sponsor named Erin Simpson that sent me goodies in the mail and another person who made me a really awesome blanket that's all mine! I'm super spoiled and getting lots of love and affection. So far I've made two trips to the vet for check ups and I have to say, car rides are pretty fun! My foster mom gets me french fries after my vet appointments which are super yummy! I can't wait to have a place to call my home and a family to claim as mine :-) I'm SO thankful Carolina Boxer Rescue came and rescued me because now I feel like a princess that's loved :-)\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCome visit carolinaboxerrescue.org to learn more about me and see more pictures.

            "description": "Hi, my name is Sweet Pea! I am very pretty and have cool brindle spots and some freckles. My eyes are full of expression and beautiful. I am a very compassionate dog and will make someone a great companion. I can tell when you need a hug or cuddles and give them freely. I can jump really high (I could probably clear a four foot fence, but have never tried), when I get excited. I am very curious and love to explore both inside and outside.\n\nI spent my first three years of life living outdoors in a kennel. I was surrendered to Save-a-Bull and adjusted to inside life pretty quickly. I was adopted and lived with my new family for about six months, but my prey drive got the best of me and I had a run in with the family cat. Sadly, I was surrendered to Save-a-Bull again, and I am being fostered by the same family and I am loving hanging out with them.\n\nI am kennel and potty trained! I have been sleeping in my foster's bed and I love to cuddle. Right now I am relaxing and adjusting to my current situation. I have mastered sit, shake, touch, wait and lift (to get the leash out from behind my front paws when we walk). I love treats - the stinkier, the better! I would love to take a training class with you, so we can bond and I can show you how smart I am. I would also love to do some agility training, as I am very athletic.\n\nI have lived with a toddler and we did well together. I also met a baby and was not impressed, but I left her alone. I think I would enjoy living with older children who can help train me and give me good cuddles. I like to give hugs and might be too much for smaller children to handle. I would not do well living with cats or smaller animals - I have a big prey drive and it gets me into trouble. I have lived with other big dogs, both of them were male. I adapt to other dogs very well - I adapt to their play style and will stop when they indicate that they are done. I will try to encourage play-by-play bowing and giving playful barks. If that does not work, I back off. I read other dogs extremely well. I love to go for walks and I love to wrestle with other dogs.\n\nI need a family that will give me some time to adjust to a new home. I need to be reassured that everything is okay and that you love me and I can trust you. Once we have bonded, I will be your best friend for life. I adjust to my situation very well and fast. If you want to go biking, I will be ready and willing to walk all day. If you want to spend the day watching TV and chilling, I will be your cuddle buddy and enjoy spending time just hanging out with you. I just want to be included in your activities and adventures.\n\nMy dream day would consist of hanging out with my family and being rewarded with good treats and great company. Could that be you?",

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: 01/18/20\nReason for being in rescue: puppy mill bust\nFoster location: Foster Home in Union, SC\nSpecial Needs? Betty has nursed her last litter of puppies. She has been spayed, had a dental polishing on 5/29/20, and is ready for her forever home.\nWeight: 8.60 lb\nHeight: 6 in\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $200\n\nFence needed? No\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? We are seeking a home with an experienced dog owner and someone who is home more than they're away. Betty needs an experienced chihuahua owner. She is not for a first time dog owner. She is not for a home with children. She needs someone that understands her breed and has the patience to help her continue to learn what it means to be a pet. She is much better with male dogs - of any size. She marks around other little girls.\n\nWhat is my personality like? Betty came to CPR from a puppy mill bust in Laurens, SC. She was pregnant and gave birth to one baby girl the second day she was here, but unfortunately her pup was born with a birth defect and did not make it. Betty stepped up to nurse another litter of orphaned pups. It is clear that all Betty has known is being a mom.\n\nBetty is very timid at first, but once you gain her trust she is all yours. Most of her life has been spent as a breeding dog, which means limited socialization and human interaction. Betty is a classic chihuahua - feisty, sometimes moody, but incredibly loyal. She likes things on her terms. Betty enjoys sitting in a lap but would be equally happy sitting beside you on the couch. She is content to sleep in a dog bed at night. She has impeccable house manners in her foster home.\n\nBetty is a wonderful dog. She would be great for quiet retirees looking for a dog to share their heart with. She does not require a ton of exercise and really just wants a quiet life.\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Timid and shy at first.\n\nOther tips and tidbits: Betty's estimated birthday is 1/15/2012.\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

            "description": "Meet Bingo!  He is guessed to be about 3-4 years old and weighs 55 lbs.  He came from a farm in Indiana where he was free roaming and the neighbors threatened to shoot him if found on their property, so the owner decided to surrender him for their safety.  \n\nBingo can be slow to warm up to new people, so he is looking for a patient adopter who will understand he needs a slow approach to build his trust. Once he trusts you he is just a happy goofy boy.  His favorite things are treats and squirrel watching in the yard.  He has had no accidents in the house and usually only barks if he sees someone walking by the house.  He gets along with the other dogs in his foster home (between 3-20 lbs), except for one little young male chihuahua that has it out for him.  We would describe Bingo's interactions with other dogs as coexisting- basically not seeking out attention or engaging in play, but fine being around the other dogs.  If his new home had dog siblings we think he would do best with dogs that would respect his space and be happy to coexist with him.  \n\nBingo is currently living with a (very dog savvy) 2 year old and he has done very good with him, however Bingo is VERY clumsy and doesn't really know his size and has knocked over the toddler numerus times.  For that reason we think an all adult home or home with older, dog savvy children would be best.  \n\nHe can be nervous in busy environments, so ideally we are looking for a quiet setting for this boy- away from a lot of traffic (both pedestrian and vehicle) and a quieter home without a lot of new visitors.  He is still learning how to walk nicely on a leash and has made so much progress from when we first got him. He can be a bit erratic, so you have to have a good grip on the leash and be prepared for when he tries to change directions quickly.  We think with increased expsure to leash walking he will be a pro in no time!\n\nHe is at risk for jumping fences, so we will be carefully screening applicants to ensure that measures would be in place to keep him safe and secure if a fence is to be used as the primary method of containment outside.  \n\nBingo has a cataract in his right eye and also glaucoma in that eye.  He is currently getting eye drops and ointment twice a day in hopes to reduce and maintain the pressure, but if medications do not work he may need that eye removed down the road.  He also was treated for Lymes disease and no further treatment is necessary at this point.  \n\nBingo's adoption donation of $250 helps cover the cost of his medical care.  \n\nApplication, reference checks, and home visit required. Adopters must live 1.5 hours driving distance from Romeoville, IL. For more information on adopting, please email us at info@perfectpooches.org.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete an adoption application, which can be found on our website at www.perfectpooches.org under the Adoption Process tab.  All dogs are spayed/neutered, current on vaccines, heartworm tested (age appropriate), fecal tested and/or dewormed, and microchipped.",

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: 09/21/2018 original intake, adopted but returned June 2020\nReason for being in rescue: In 2018, Marty Bear Doodle was left tied to the outside of an animal shelter in GA by his owners. CPR pulled him from the shelter. We placed him but he returned to us a year later when his two-person, socially active home realized he would be happier in a quieter environment.\nFoster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SC\nSpecial Needs? Horrible ears - we've resolved the infection for now but he will need to be watched for life on his ears. He is on a bi-weekly ointment for his ears. Marty Bear Doodle also has extensive discospondylitis and lumbosacral disease. He sometimes need to have a medication called methacarbonal when his back goes out. Finally, Marty is HIGHLY flea allergic. A single flea will cause a major skin issue. He must be on regular monthly preventative.\n\nWeight: 14.2 lb\nHeight: 13 in\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $200\n\nFence needed? Yes - leashes scare Marty \"Care Bear\" (our nickname for him is Care Bear. He would be happier with his own yard to romp and play in.\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Care Bear requires a special quiet home that would be willing to work around his quirks and help him become the dog he has the potential to be. He needs an experienced dog owner with the patience to earn his trust. A calm home with little distractions.\n\nWhat is my personality like? Care Bear needs a quiet home with very few changes or visitors. He is smart and sensitive to his environment. He will need patience communicating his needs to you. He was potty trained in his home and could go outside in a fenced yard with no leash. He will walk on a leash, but they scare him and he prefers to be home instead. He will bark at you if you do not give him time to adjust to the change (going outside/inside).\n\nBear could be an only dog with a patient human or he could have calm, stable doggie companions. The big thing for Bear is no change. Bear likes treats and responds well to treats before a change; transitions/change is difficult for him. The types of changes that are seem to be focused on someone coming in or out of the house. In his current foster home, change is constant and he's getting used to it. With the right understanding owner, he would be great. We know this boy deserves to have a special person to help him and we hope we can find the right person and home for him!\n\nBear is very food oriented and this is the way to his heart. So far he has gotten along with other dogs he has met but in his home he was not happy with other dogs - probably because they came in or out. When he is scared of another dog, he barks at them like he's never been around other dogs before.\n\nBear is a special boy whose past is a mystery and whose future needs patience and a firm and experienced handler. In the right home, Bear will be an amazing companion and best friend.\n\nImportant Note: Bear sheds slightly - less when he is kept short. He is not hypoallergenic. We think he is a mix of long haired jack russell and poodle.\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Cautious and nervous at first. Come with treats. That makes all the difference.\n\nOther tips and tidbits: Marty Bear's estimated birthday is 9/21/2011\n\nHouse trained? Bear is crate trained and responding well to outside schedule. Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

Applications for Bobby will be accepted from Chatham Kent only for review\n\nName - Bobby\nBreed: Pug\nAge: 7\nSex: male\nWeight: 25 lbs.\nActivity level: high\nFur: brown, short\n\nWe accept applications from Chatham Kent, Windsor and any points within these boundaries.\n\nMeet Mr Bobby.  Our friend here recently lost his owner, which has really shaken his life up.  It was him and his owner for his whole life, so he needs to find that special someone to take him in.\n\nBobby is the energizer bunny! He is a jumper and can reach the stove top if he wants to. When making his dinner he will jump up and down until you set the bowl on the floor. He is a gobbler, so he will need a special dish to make him eat slowly.  He\u2019s a smart boy, and has learned to sit and wait until you give him the ok to eat.  \n\nBobby is not a snuggly boy; he likes to sit beside you and hang out.  He will sleep in your bed, and will snuggle slightly for sleep, but other than that he is very independent.\n\nAs Mr Bobby is a bit of a bossy pants, he needs to be the only furry friend in your home.  Our guy Bobby just needs someone to keep him company, that he can chill out with.  He will even sit and watch TV with you, he keeps an eye out for dogs!  \n\nIf you can give this fun little guy a place to chill, please fill out the application on www.ckanimalrescue.com.  \n\nBobby is neutered and up to date with his vaccinations.\n\nAdoption fee is $375\n\n",

He is very food motivated and wants to please but definitely needs a firm, experienced handler to keep him in line. Bailey is a bit timid at times so will do best in a calmer environment. \n\nBailey loves to play and would love a running companion. He does like other dogs when introduced properly, would do best with a submissive canine mate. He appears to have a high prey drive so cats and other small animals are not a good idea. Older children only. \n\nThis boy is house-trained, crate trained, and neutered. He is currently being fostered by one of the rescues trainers and showing huge improvements.",

We believe he is a discarded hunting dog, Traveler struggled with socializing with people, and has come a long way while in foster care.\n\nGreat Points:\nTraveler is very shy but just as sweet as can be! He is great with kids, other dogs, and didn't really react to cats the few times he's been around them. He has great leash manners, crate trained, and an all-around good boy!\n\nBest Home:\nTraveler's perfect family would have a quieter home, ideally with a retired person or couple. Traveler is loving retirement life and would enjoy sharing his golden years with his people. He loves long walks, naps, breakfast time, and following his people around. He does need to be crated when home alone, but he's very happy with it and will often nap in there anyway. New people and unfamiliar sounds make him nervous, so he would love someone with a little patience to help him come out of his shell and show him all the love. He would need a fenced in yard, as he does have a tendency to exit seek when he gets nervous. He would do great with another dog pal, but he would be fine without one as well.\n\nSubmit your applications at: https://oneloveanimalrescue.com/pre-adoption-application/",

            "description": "Age: 8 years\nWeight: 7.5 lbs.\nAdoption Fee: $250\nFostered in Baton Rouge, Louisiana\n\n7/31/20 - Kiki went to the dogtor yesterday to get all updated.  Her mouth was so bad, she lost 18 teeth.  Glad those bad things are gone.  She has 2 teeth left and won't mind eating soft food AT ALL since she is such a food hog.  This is why it is so important to get regular dentals performed, on smaller dogs especially. The results can be a toothless wonder at a young age.  Oh well, what's done is done and Kiki is still happy and cute.\n\n7/23/20 - To quote Louis Sabin, \u201cNo matter how little money and how few possessions you own, having a dog makes you rich\u201d.  So, Kiki wants to know just how rich do you want to be?\n\nKiki isn\u2019t one of those totally clingy yorkies that is all about herself.  I know, shocking, right?  Don\u2019t get us wrong, she is a female and does demand a certain amount of love and affection, but she doesn\u2019t have to be the one on your lap all the time.  We are hoping this will change once she gets into a home with just 1 or 2 other dogs.  She is co-existing fine with the other dogs in the house but does not play with them or toys quite yet for that matter.  She is a very hearty eater and tries to convince the humans to share their food with her.  Not going to happen little girl!\n\nShe is very social and never meets a stranger.  Kiki is a talker (barker), so an apartment would not be the best digs for her.  She also needs a secure fenced in yard and humans that are very careful with open doors since she is very interested in \u201cthe other side\u201d.  Maybe this is how she became stray.  We think she obviously had a nice family that loved her at some point in her life, but she was picked up stray and brought to the local shelter.  The shelter and Yorkie Haven Rescue reached out far and wide to locate an owner, but perhaps it was just meant for Kiki to move on.\n\nAt first, Kiki felt crowded and didn\u2019t want to sleep in the human bed, but she is now coming around and seems to like to share the human pillow.  This will be another plus for her with less dogs.  She will definitely have some accidents as it will take time for her to get adjusted, but she will go outside when brought, just needs to be brought often.  Even though Kiki isn\u2019t clingy, she does like to give kisses.  And foster mom loves to get them.\nHer legs are a little longer, so jumping up and down on the sofa isn\u2019t a challenge for her, but to get in the bed, she will either need steps, or to be put up and down.\n\nSo, going back to that \u201chaving a dog makes you rich\u201d quote.  What\u2019s say you and I buy a lottery ticket\u2026.. TOGETHER!\n",

My foster mom has been calling me Lucky and I answer to it because I like that name better!\n\nI am an incredibly-loving sweet dog that wants to be your new best friend. I was a stray and a nice lady took me to animal control. My foster picked me up and brought me home to get help with my heartworm treatment. I just finished all my treatments and I am very healthy. It took me a couple of days to warm up to my foster family but now I am best friends with my foster mom. I like to have one person that is my person and that's my foster mom right now.\n\nI need a fenced yard. Probably best if I have at least a six foot privacy fence because I can climb and jump over a four foot fence.\n\nI live with cats and leave them alone. I love people, playing, and going for walks around the neighborhood. I am a little shy with new folks and children, but given an appropriate amount of time I should acclimate comfortably. I do well with other dogs that my foster mom has brought over for play dates too.\n\nI am scheduled to be neutered in a few weeks and I'm up-to-date on vaccinations, flea/tick preventative, heartworm preventative and deworming.\n\nI do excellent with pottying on a leash when my family takes me out on a consistent basis.\n\nI weigh in at around 50 lbs and I am a true cuddle bug that would make a great family friend!\n\nAdoption fee is $250.

No apartments!\nSpecial Info:\n\nThe information we are providing for this animal was developed based on observations and assessments in a shelter or foster environment. We do our best to provide information that will help determine if the dog might be a good fit for you. Please note that behaviors may change in a home environment. We also ask our applicants to assume that any animal they adopt from us will need to be potty trained and learn house manners, although this is not always the case. Our online animal bios are designed to provide as much information as possible and answer some anticipated questions. We do not have the resources to respond to emails with more specific questions.\n\nWe are receiving an unusually high number of applications per pet at this time! Please follow the rules below to ensure your application is reviewed; pay attention closely to these instructions because applications will NOT be processed if they are not followed. Please keep in mind that dog/cat availability is currently changing by the hour; you will receive an email if the animal you are interested in is no longer available. New dogs become available almost every day, so feel free to let us know if someone else interests you if your initial choice is already adopted! \n\nFill out the application (DOG: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IHD-DOG-Application-9-10-18.pdf, CAT: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IHD-CAT-Application.pdf) completely. Every question must be answered, and it must be signed. If you are going to type your responses, open the application, save it, type your answers, and save it again. \n\n-Applicants must be 21+ years old and live within a 50-mile radius of our shelter at 22415 Groesbeck Hwy, Warren 48089.\n\n-You must identify at least 1 dog/cat that you are interested in. If there are multiple dogs/cats, number them in order of priority. \n\n-Scan a copy of proof of home ownership (i.e. tax bill, deed, or mortgage payment - you can black out the account #, etc.) or animal clause/agreement of your rental agreement.\n\n-Attach the application and home ownership proof/rental agreement animal clause to a new email and send it to bark@iheartdogs.org. The subject line must be formatted to read \"\"#1 choice of dog/cat, Your First and Last Name\"\". Example: Subject: Fido, Jane Doe\nOnce your application is received, it will be assigned to an Adoption Counselor who will follow-up with the applicant who is the best fit within a few days, or to discuss other dogs/cats. It could take up to a couple of weeks for you to receive a final disposition on your application so there is no need to check on the status.\n\n-Introductions will be scheduled by appointment only, 45 minutes per appointment. The entire household, including current dogs, must be present for the appointment. The introductions will take place outside in our parking lot.\n\n-We will continue to perform vet checks for current and prior pets in the household.\n\n-Home visits will be in person for the yard and virtual for inside the home.\n\n-Finalizing the adoption will also be scheduled by appointment.\n\nWhile this process may seem cumbersome, it is interim during COVID-19, and it is designed to help us respond to the volume of emails we receive every day. Since we are receiving a high volume of applications, please be patient if a dog/cat is no longer available. \n\nThank you for your understanding.",

IF YOU MEET OUR CRITERIA FOR ADOPTION OF THIS DOG, PLEASE FOLLOW THE LINK TOWARD THE BOTTOM OF THE PROFILE TO COMPLETE OUR ONLINE APPLICATION. THANK YOU!\n\nMeet Roscoe!\n\nRoscoe is a super sweet, loyal affectionate young staffie who loves to play with other dogs. We believe Roscoe is 1.5 years old. He is very small for the breed at about 40lbs. \n\nRoscoe was rescued by a Good Samaritan after his first owner moved from his apartment and left Roscoe behind. The first owner had not neutered or vaccined him and worst of all, he hadn\u2019t trained him either. Poor boy!\n\nSince being in the care of people who care, Roscoe has been neutered and vaccined and has come a long way in his training. He is a young, playful and athletic dog and needs continued training in his new home. He wants to be by \u2018his\u2019 person\u2019s side and really wants to please his person. \n\nOur primary criteria for placement of Roscoe is a home with a securely fenced backyard, people who aren\u2019t gone from the home excessive hours. He would be best as an only dog or with a dog companion who is his size or bigger and very calm. \n\nAdoption Process: We are not first come first served. Indigo Rescue focuses on finding good matches between dogs and families to ensure life long adoptions. We deliver all dogs to their new homes. All of our dogs are in foster homes. If you\u2019re interested in meeting one of our dogs, please complete our adoption application using the following link, The link is not live, so you will need to copy and paste it into your browser:  https://storage.googleapis.com/gator-users/user680788/documents/d1742bff02e44c2ea25649cb45df5103/Pet%20Application%20Form%20December%202020.pdf\nIf the dog you're interested in seems compatible with your lifestyle we'll set up a time for you to meet the dog privately.\nPLEASE NOTE: Indigo Rescue only adopts to homes within 30 miles of Beaverton because our volunteers deliver all of our dogs to their adoptive homes. We work very hard to create a family of our Indigo Rescue adopters because we want to be close enough to help in case there are any problems. We want everyone to be happy and successful!\n\n**ALL of our dogs, puppies, cats, kittens and rabbits come vaccined to their age, spayed/neutered and microchipped.\n\nThank you for your interest in adopting and saving a life.",

            "description": "Also in need of a foster home ~ \nNMDOG KENZIE is available for adoption to a very special human! \n\n\nKENZIE is a Belgian Malinois / Border Collie cross, per her DNA test results. She is NOT going to be a typical family pet & will not be placed as one. In KENZIES best interest & in our best efforts to set KENZIE & her people up for success...we are ONLY seeking those w breed/handling & training experience with working dogs. We employ & condone only positive, fear/force free training methods. We also expect KENZIE to live inside of the home with her human, as a treasured companion. Working can either be done professionally or as a hobby...as long as KENZIE is treated with respect, has structure & a \"job\" meeting all of her needs, she will be an absolute treasure of a dog! If you are not interested in SAR work, extreme agility/flyball or luring, LE/Cadaver work, etc...you are not the right human for KENZIE. If you have small children &/or other animals in your home or in your immediate circle.....you are not the right human for KENZIE. If you are still reading....please, allow us to tell you more! \n\nKENZIE was first discovered as a 3 mo old pup \"living\" at the end of her chain on a NM Indian Reservation. She was suffering terribly with a severe case of demodectic mange & starvation. Because of \"sovereign protections\" there was nothing that could legally be done to remove her from the situation. Over time (6 mos to be exact) & with the dedication of a handful of motivated people....KENZIE was finally legally signed over to NMDOG. Her condition was now much, much worse & mentally....the neglect & cruelty had began taking its toll. This was the only \"life\" KENZIE had ever known. Initially, KENZIE was extremely painful to the touch, her skin was completely infected, covered in oozy rotten scabs & open sores. Even the bottom of her feet were raw with mange. KENZIE weighed only 32# at 9mos old when she first entered the NMDOG program & never in her life, had she experienced a comforting touch, a kind word, a soft clean bed or a warm meal. Over the first few months, KENZIE learned that human touch was good & it provided comfort, not pain. She learned not to bite the hand that feeds her & over time...she stopped guarding her meals & possessions. Now KENZIE happily obliges in a game of \"drop it - leave it\".  KENZIE has incredible drive & is constantly working on impulse control - but being in a kennel situation as KENZIE currently is, with limited volunteer time, puts limits on KENZIES progress. She needs her very own super dedicated & FUN human in order to truly thrive!! KENZIE is wicked smart as you can imagine - (see Malinios/Border Collie X), smarter than most humans we know :) Shes going to require someone that can always stay a step ahead of KENZIE & quide her in the right direction. We believe KENZIE deserves to fulfill her absolute potential in life & we are looking for the special human to help her do just that! If you are interested in KENZIE, please reach out to us right away!! \n\nAs an all volunteer, foster based, 501(c)3 non profit rescue, NMDOG is always in need of new, approved foster & adoptive homes in order to continue our Mission: to serve & protect New Mexico's Forgotten Dogs!! \n\nIf you see a dog you are interested in that says \"in need of a foster home\", we are currently seeking a temporary foster home for that dog in order to provide them with the cozy & loving experience of a home environment while we work hard to find their forever family. This also frees up space & funds, which enables us to save another life. There is never a cost to foster for NMDOG & you will have the dedicated support of the NMDOG TEAM every step of the way. We take the time to really get to know the needs & personalities of our kids & we go the extra mile to ensure we make the best possible match...setting our dogs & their humans up for success! To learn more about the NMDOG foster program & to submit the foster application, please visit this link on our website - www.nmdog.org/foster\n\nOur adoption fee is $250 which includes; a 7 week NMDOG obedience/bonding class with their new family (classes are located in Abq & are also offered to our foster guardians), a complimentary vet wellness check & our dogs come with all of the supplies they need to get started on a trial adoption in their new home. All adopted dogs also receive free or discounted goodies & services from many of our awesome community partners!! Grooming, food, training, boarding, pet sitting & more. To learn more about the NMDOG adoption process & to submit the adoption application, please visit this link on our website - www.nmdog.org/adopt \n\nNMDOG doesn't cut any corners when it comes to the care & placement of our dogs. When a dog enters the NMDOG program, they are guaranteed to receive the very best of care. All of our available dogs have received a full medical & behavioral clearance prior to placement. They are (at the very minimum) spayed or neutered, UTD on age appropriate vaccinations, microchipped, dewormed, Heartworm tested & currently on HW/flea & tick preventative. Due to the nature of our work, many of the dogs we rescue need much more extensive care before they are cleared for adoption. At NMDOG, we stand by our dogs for life & we make a promise to always be there for them (& their people) should they ever need us. . \n\nPlease contact us directly via the links provided above or email info@nmdog.org with your interest in becoming a treasured NMDOG Foster Guardian or FoReVeR Guardian Angel to one of our amazing dogs in need!\nWe look forward to hearing from you & answering any questions you may have.

I came to Halfway to Home with Sadie (HWTH#20152A) when our owner became ill and sadly could no longer care for us.  I'm not gonna beat around the bush, I am an old fellow.  But what I lack in youthful energy, I more than make up for with my friendly and relaxed personality.  I am looking for a human or a family of humans who want a companion and family member who will love me for the rest of my life and I can love back. It would also be helpful if you would continue my diet and take me for daily walks so I can lose some weight.  I get along well with other dogs and I live with Sadie at the rescue.  For more information about me, please call Sandy at 661-824-4495 (this is a land-line phone).",

We agreed to take them on but they all came down with parvo before she could surrender them.  She went into debt trying to save all of her puppies which she did!  I'm sure they knew how much she loved them because parvo is just about always fatal to puppies.  We assumed when we did not hear from her that they all died.  Fast forward to July of this year and she contacts us and asks us if we can still help her find homes for them?  After all she went thru to save them how could we say no?  These puppies are big ole love bugs waiting to give you kisses!\n\n COMPLETED APPLICATIONS TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER INQUIRIES! IF you are interested in adopting, the FIRST step is to complete an application! Please email for an Application or copy and paste the following URL: \n\nhttps://fs26.formsite.com/nogreaterlove/form2/index.html \n\nUpon receipt of your application, the rescuer and foster in AL will contact you so you can ask any specific questions you may have!

            "description": "Wylie\n\nLocated in western Nebraska \n3 years old\n\"Purebred\" German Shepherd (I'm writing what we were told, we don't DNA our dogs, we think he may be a mix)\nGood with some dogs as long as it's not a pack situation\nNot sure on cats \nGood with older children \nGreat with guinea pigs (or he was when he was surrendered, now we are told he has a high prey drive, not sure about this)\nInsanely sweet\nHas had a lot of chaos in his life and needs a calm, breed educated and patient home\nHouse trained\nNeeds mental stimulation \nNeeds physical stimulation \nWe were told he was crate trained but so far not the case, so this will need work\nFully vetted \n65lbs\n\nPLEASE READ THE DESCRIPTION BELOW BEFORE ASKING QUESTIONS AS THEY MAY ALREADY BE ANSWERED\n\nThis handsome boy is Wylie. Wylie's story is an epically sad and discouraging one.\n\nWylie has been in his current adoptive home since November 17th. This is a German Shepherd knowledgeable home however they do have multiple dogs and a couple are older. When they took him they knew he was very protective of his home, needed mental and physical exercise and had some legit separation anxiety. We got rave reviews until the end of March. After this home adopted another HPPAW German Shepherd we were informed of issues and told they had been happening for months, this was coming Grady to what we had heard but we started to make arrangements to take him back. In April we were told that the issues had subsided and they just couldn't get rid of him they loved him too much. We were so happy and relieved for Wylie that he would get to stay with the people he had grown to know and love. However then a week ago we were again contacted and told he needed to move, this time immediately. We explained our confusion and asked for answers, what we got wasn't answers. It is what it is. At this point Wylie needs to move to ensure his safety. The adopters told us that against the adoption contract they tried to surrender the dog to the shelter who refused, knowing better. They also told us they considered trying to rehome him themselves but then didn't feel that was a good idea. So now here we are, with poor Wylie being again rehomed and losing the people he trusts again. \n\nThis sweet boy needs a patient home with no dogs or just a couple dogs. We cannot express the importance enough of a patient and understanding home. This home may have started out like that but apparently for at least one adult in the home that changed drastically. Wylie has anxiety and needs help with that, it's been apparently made worse not better since March. At this point we believe that a lot of the current issues may be situational but we cannot say that for sure. \n\nWe find this very discouraging for Wylie. He doesn't deserve everything that's happened to him. He needs love, patience and stability. \n\nOriginal Story\n\nWe were alerted to Wylie by a rescue friend when he was at risk for being shot for nipping a kid. Now before everyone dooms him lets get a better understanding of the situation he was in that this supposed \"nip\" happened. The home had SEVERAL foster children, which is an amazing thing to do, however with having over 5 rotating foster kids of various ages with various issues and no one having seen said incident it's not something we are willing to doom him for. A woman who works with this family in a professional manner reached out to some eastern NE rescues and asked for help because they did not believe this dog deserved that end. We agree, NO DOG deserves that end. Anyway, we were contacted and had a foster who had offered for another German Shepherd who, who was adopted, that immediately agreed to take him. He is very sweet and friendly and up until the point he transported to us his BFF was a guinea pig! He went to a fosters home and she immediately fell in love with him and decided she wanted to keep him, so Wylie had never been listed. She made us aware that he had some serious separation anxiety but that she wanted to work through it. We had had multiple conversations with the foster in regards to his issues and all ended the same way, we other her wanting to work through it. We supplied an escape proof crate, and advice and thought that the conditioning was going well however we were then alerted that was NOT the case and that this sweet boy needed to move immediately. His foster has worked with HPPAW for years and while this is very upsetting and emotional we ALWAYS understand every dog isn't a fit for every home. We were as heartbroken about it as she was on multiple levels, but mostly for sweet Wylie as he is again losing the home and family he knows.\n\n \n\nThis lug needs a breed experienced (or similar breed experienced home) and patient home to work with him on his separation anxiety. He also is a bit over protective of his yard and family, again, breed experience would help here as this is epically common with German Shepherds and we have zero desire to punish him for doing what he was bred to do, but he needs an equipped home. \n\n $200.00 Adoption Fee \n(Which is considered a non refundable donation and being we are a 501c3 organization it is tax deductible. The fee itself is not negotiable, our vets don't negotiate and thus neither do we.) \n\nIf you feel your home and family would be a good fit for sweet Wylie please contact us!",

He MUST live in a home in the MOUNTAINS or in the MIDDLE OF NO WHERE.  After much evaluation and consultations we have decided Blue will do very well in a very specific home environment. He is a great dog, smart, sweet, and very trainable. But he needs a quiet home with a solid routine and experienced dog owners. He is looking for a home up in the mountains or on a farm where he can get lots of exercise but not run into people or dogs he doesn't know. He gets along great with the dogs in his home but over reacts when meeting people and dogs on walks. He is very protective of his home and car. He is a great guard dog. We are looking for a house with no weekly gardener, housekeepers or garbage men who come too close to the house. He finds them very threatening. Where he is now, the garbage cans are picked up at the end of the driveway where he can't see them and all is peace on garbage day.\n\nWe are looking for a peaceful home and a mom or dad with a big heart to take in this very special boy. He would do well in a multi dog household but no kids or cats. While he would love your kids he would not like their visiting friends. \u00a0Blue is only 2 years old and is currently in Romoland, California.\n\nIf you would like to make this special boy part of your family, please fill out an application.  His adoption fee is $550.\nhttps://www.emailmeform.com/builder/form/3ZOB2l03Y9",

Yoshimi was found in a kill shelter with a mass on her abdomen. Yoshimi was receiving no medical treatment at the shelter, so we took this sweet girl into rescue and immediately brought her to our veterinary partner for treatment. This adorable girl deserves a home where she will be cherished and loved as a member of the family, where her needs will be met and she will receive proper care.

It only took me one day to learn to trust and love my foster mom...I have a lot of love to give! I haven\u2019t had much experience on a leash, but amazingly I walk quite well on one.\nI ride great in the car.\u00a0\u00a0I enjoy my crate, it gives me security. I have plenty of energy and would like an active household that would take me out walking, hiking, or even running. I love to play and will fetch a ball and would get along just fine\nwith another dog playmate.\u00a0\u00a0I have not met a cat, but due to my breed mix, I would most likely chase one.\nKids would be just fine, but probably old enough to understand my playful nature that might knock over the younger ones.\nI am a gorgeous auburn color underneath my brindle stripes.\u00a0\u00a0You will be having to stop to let other people admire me when you take me out in public. A fenced yard is highly highly recommended due to my skittish nature and hound mixture.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My house manners are very good, too! \nTrust me, if you adopt me, you will wonder how you ever lived without me at your side! \ncontact irondawgs13@gmail.com for an adoption application",

She's potty trained and walks great on a leash.  She was found on the side of the road all alone and starving.  She's ready to find her forever home!\nYou can complete an adoption application on our website at:  \n     www.onceuponatailrescue.com\nor\n     Scroll down on this page & click \"More About Us\", & then click \"Adoption            Application\" underneath our bright Pink logo. \n\nIf you want to meet a pup in person, Once Upon a Tail Rescue does adoption events at PetSmart in Covington, LA on most Saturdays with many of our adoptable dogs there. \n\nDon't forget to complete your application ahead of time, so you don't miss out on the pup you've connected with.  If pre-approved, you have first priority & can usually take home your new best friend the same day!  \n\n*Please note that there is no obligation to adopt by completing an application.*\n\n**All dogs are required to have complete vet services, including shots, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip, which are included in the Adoption Fee. Some dogs may still require completion of these services due to current age, size, breed and/or health. All vet services must be done at the vet clinic used by Once Upon a Tail Rescue.",

            "description": "Rosie is a young female pit mix who is looking for her forever home! She will require a family that is familiar with stronger breeds and rescue dogs. She is super sweet with people but has some reactivity with other dogs and can be fearful in new situations/of loud noises. With consistent and structured training we believe she can get better at being more calm and social around other dogs her size.\n\nRosie would thrive in a calm home that can provide her structure and where she can decompress. She loves getting attention and pets from her people and is very treat motivated. \n\nRosie is smart and willing to learn if you have some yummy treats! Rosie is crate and potty trained, sleeps well in her crate throughout the night. She LOVES getting belly rubs and shoulder massages from her family, and enjoys the company of people. \n\nDue to her fears and reactivity, she requires a free standing home outside of the city with a fenced in yard. She needs to be the only dog in the home with no cats and kids over the age of 12 that are respectful. \n\nRosie is UTD on shots, microchipped and spayed. Her adoption fee is $350.",

We do not know what she thinks about cats. Mona had tested positive for Ehrlichia, a common tick borne disease similar to Lyme's.  She has completed her course of treatment and has been feeling fine.  Mona is about 5 years old and 40 pounds.  Please help Mona find the loving home she deserves.\n\nWe do NOT ship our animals.

            "description": "Fans of our rescue may remember the adorable Atreyu who is now known as Cooper!! He was adopted last spring by an amazing family who adores him, but we have been working together extensively and have made the very difficult decision to try to find him another home! \n\nCooper is about 2 years old, and is constantly on the go! Nothing pleases him more than a game of fetch with a ball or frisbee. He is a fantastic soccer goalie, and prefers toys over treats! Cooper loves adventuring through trails, running alongside a bike, checking out the ocean and riding in the truck. He absolutely loves car rides and does great on road trips! \n\nCooper is intelligent and inquisitive and picks up commands easily....he also just completed a 2 week board and train, and have mastered his training skills even more! (plus his adoption includes a consultation with these trainers as a follow up to help him succeed in his new home!) While eager to play, Cooper also loves to cuddle at the end of a long day. He enjoys sleeping under a blanket or next to a human and is the sweetest boy! He loves to greet visitors with tail wags and kisses. Cooper is full of love and up for anything. He is a wonderful dog with a fun, quirky personality! \n\nThe reason Cooper is in need of a new family is because he has become reactive towards young children, and other pups. For this reason, we feel he would THRIVE in a home without kids where he can be the one and only! He is a really amazing guy, who just needs a more quiet home where he can really succeed....and we just know the right family is out there for him!\n\nCooper is up to date on vaccines, and is neutered, and on preventatives, and as mentioned above would come with some consultations with our trainers to make sure he has everything he needs to succeed! When in an environment without other pups he is an absolute STAR, so he just needs the right family to see him and snatch him up! \n\nInterested in this handsome boy?? Get your application in here: \n\nwww.harleyshavendogrescue.com/adopt\n\nDon't miss your chance on this sweet boy!\n\n***PLEASE NOTE:  Our adoption radius is 60 minutes from Perkasie, PA.  We do not ship/transport our dogs***",

Said to be 13 she can be cranky and will nip unless treated gently and carefully. But when she knows her human she is a love!   The cute factor is huge as well as her incredible spirit.  Tumor hanging down, as huge as it is, she was full of beans and behaved as if a regular old dog with out a care in the world.  I see dachshund tenacity and personality.  Post surgery was tough and touch and go with bruising and a lot of pain.  But she is a strong dog and came through and is now completely healed.  We did not biopsy so with Helen you think pawsitively and send great energies her way because in our book she has beat the odds thanks to a great surgeon and her healing abilities.  She has also made huge strides in her behavior and has allowed volunteers to get close and even pick her up now.  She is a very sweet little lady",

Oz was accompanied by one of his favorite volunteers (Fredley Tynan) who helped him with his photo session.  Oz was also encouraged and had his self-confidence bolstered when he saw other members of his fan club (and two of his former housemates)  :)  Oz 'perked up' when he saw John and Lynncoln Tynan with Oz' friends Pirate and Wizard cheering him on and helping him with his 'Westminster Show Dog' Poses :)\n\nOz is still cautious around folks that he doesn't know well, but he is making progress with his trust issues.  Our kennel techs (and also the Tynan family) would be happy to introduce you to Oz if you are interested in giving him a fabulous home.\n\nOz weighs 55 lbs. He will be neutered before being adopted by his new family.\n\nOz was neutered on July 29, 2020 and was also given rabies vaccine.\n\n",

Chance is extremely sweet and very wiggly! If he was a person he would be Owen Wilson - going about his day saying \u201cwow\u201d just like Owen. He likes pets and walks, though does pull on the leash so a fenced in yard may be best (though not required). Chance seems to have had a bit of a troubled past and isn't the type of dog that is going to want to be cuddled, however he does enjoy some good scratches. Despite his history, Chance is nothing but an expressive ball of fluff! \n\nIf you are interested in Chance, please fill out an adoption application online through our website, foothillshumanesociety.org. \n",

            "description": "Biscotti is a 5 year old male Pomeranian rescued from a puppy mill.\nHe spent the first 2 years of his life in the house being a pet, learning commands. Once the babies came he was moved to the kennel with larger dogs where his leg muscle was ripped and lost one of his toes. \nWe then were called to rescue him.\nHe was not used to living in the house with a family. He will not do well with children and would do best in a quiet home. It makes him nervous to sit in a lap but he wants to be near his people next to them or at their feet. When he came to us he had been shaved which is not good for Pomeranians. Our groomer has performed magic and he is beautiful. He also did very well at the groomer.\n\nBiscotti wants to love and trust but it will take time and patience.\n\nIf you think you would be interested, please complete our no obligation application and we can start the process at www.luv4k9s.org. Select Available Dogs then scroll down to application, complete and submit. \n\nA physical secure fence attached to the residence is a requirement to adopt a dog from our rescue. Invisible fence doesn't meet this requirement. No exceptions.\n\nOur adoption area is primarily OHIO. We will consider KENTUCKY, AND INDIANA AND CERTAIN AREAS OF MICHIGAN, WEST VIRGINIA, AND PENNSYLVANIA. \n\nWE DO NOT SHIP NOR ARRANGE TRANSPORTS.\n\nTHE APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED AND SUBMITTED BEFORE WE CAN START THE PROCESS. \n\nIT CAN TAKE AT LEAST 2 WEEKS TO PROCESS AN APPLICATION SOMETIMES LONGER DEPENDING ON VOLUNTEER AVAILABILITY AND NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS RECEIVED SO PLEASE BE PATIENT. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters must understand that each home is different, and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. \nHomes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for:\n1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (ex. a 4 month old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break) \n2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old, to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise.\n3.) Socialization: The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home.\n4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded tenfold, for years to come.\nPlease do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy. Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time consuming and can be expensive. All Dogs Require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well-trained, well socialized dog is more than worth the effort put in to get them there. \n\nOur adoption fee includes spay/neuter, routine shots, rabies, worming, microchipped, heartworm testing and they are on monthly preventative. Visit our website www.luv4k9s.org for more information and to complete an application.\n",

An energetic dog like me will need a companion who's able to offer plenty of exercise and mental stimulation every day, like hiking, jogging, or playing fetch.

I love to go for car rides and play with a ball. You'll never be waiting on me to start an adventure! People are my best friends--really and truly--and I need a home where my people are able to be with me most of the time to help with my separation anxiety. I can not be crated due to my anxiety. Since I've not always had an easy-going life I require a home that understands how to engage me; give me the space I want, and allow me to feel comfortable. My foster mom says that I am loving, playful I am best suited as the only dog in the home and I do need a home without children as I do enjoy my personal space all to myself.",

He gives full warning of how far to push things but did take chicken from our hands and very gently at that.   He is very vocal, talks and changes what he says depending on what he thinks is going to happen.  Marvin our pig is helping with him and being very respectful. Red may have rear osteo pain affecting his temperament so started him on pain meds which they were administering at LA AS. .  Meade Canine works well for dogs like Red Robin who really don't have many options and are often first to be euthanized.  And watching dogs react to dogs like Red Robin is interesting, adding to dogs complexities.  He is now coming in and staying in the house and hang out where dogs congregate but basically he resembles a feral dog and looks a lot like a coyote.  If you have a ranch or barn where he can wander about undisturbed or you want to take the time with him to make him trust and respect you that would be great but for now I think Red is here to stay!  People think he is a coyote when they see him and tend to avoid him but we are quite happy he is here.  He follows us everywhere come dinner time.  Red Robin is making strides quickly.",

He walks well on leash and knows how to crate. We don\u2019t know anything about his background as he came to us through a shelter in Texas. He\u2019s very friendly with humans and we have not a cat tested him. He seems to be OK with other dogs. He will need experienced handlers. We do not recommend that he go to at home with young children. He has high drive and loves to play ball. \n\nAll pets are fully vaccinated, heartworm tested and negative or if positive treated for heartworms, microchipped, and neutered/spayed before adoption. You will not be allowed to meet and greet with our dogs until we have a completed application back from you. Once we have this and after approval to adopt from our group you will be able to meet all adoptable dogs who are a good fit for you and your family. \n\nPlease contact savapetwac@yahoo.com for an application. There is no cost to apply. There is an adoption fee for the dogs \u2013 puppies are typically $300 and adult dogs $200. \n\nPlease keep in mind that we are a small non-profit group run by volunteers and we all have full time jobs outside of the rescue group. We are not a shelter. Most dogs are in foster homes and any visits will need to be coordinated with the foster families. \n\nplease email\nsavapetwac@yahoo.com\nfor an application.\nWe require an application before meeting any of our adoptable dogs.

I am social so continuing to socialize me will be important.\n\nI need a home with a wooden fenced backyard. No apartments or townhomes. If you're interested in a handsome boy I could possibly be a good fit for your family.\n\nDo Not call to let us know you are interested. Follow the step stated below.\nAdopter for Riddick must be at least 25 years old. Adoption fee is $650.00.\n\nRiddick is currently in Texas but will travel to the PNW once an adopter has been found.\n\n***The first step in the process if you are interested in being considered for Riddick, is to email us information about yourself and your family.

He is not the boss of the two midgets in my house, Ice and my 12lb boss bitch poodle mix, so it's very much a case-by-case basis.  An only dog home would be nice and simple, but he lives with six other dogs here and is completely fine with cats when he's not eating\n        -Not for a first time dog owner but has made huge improvements here.  He falls asleep in my arms, loves being near his person, and would probably enjoy an obedience class\n\n: \nEscalade has a strong personality and is protective of his food.  He would do best in a child-free home that has previous dog experience.  If there is an alpha female dog in the home that would be great for him.  <P>  \n\nESCALADE is shy, 10-month-old, Labrador Retriever and Rhodesian Ridgeback mix (as of 10/18) that will weigh approximately 50-60 pounds at full maturity.\n\nHe's friendly, quiet, and sweet.  ESCALADE is a wonderful little companion.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT?\n\nIf you would like to meet, foster or adopt this pet, please fill out our online FOSTER/ADOPTION APPLICATION which can be found in the main menu of our website or at the bottom of this page - simply copy and paste the link into your browser. EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY:  Meetings at our Adoption Center are by appointment only (no walk-ins).  An online adoption application is required and must be approved prior to meeting any animals.  Adoption appointments are set up by email by our Adoption Coordinator (no phone calls, please).  This process ensures our dedicated time to the animals in our care, as well as full attention to adopters at scheduled times.  \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

            "description": "Foster or Foster-to-Adopt wanted! - Please read entire description. Frida needs a foster to get through a temporary medical condition that requires rest and potential surgery involving a partial tear in her knee. Medical needs are financially covered by rescue at our vet in Lafayette. If interested, please complete an application on our website at www.pawswapofgreaterlafayette.com/adopting. Her adoption fee is $150 once adopted. Please email us if you have any questions after reading her profile below. pawswapofgreaterlafayette@aol.com\n\n***Temporary Medical Care Needed\nFrida is under medical care and needs temporary rest in her new foster / adoptive home to help her heal a cruciate injury that is requiring rest for now in hopes of recovery without surgery. Pawswap will cover this medical cost including potential surgery if that is required. She is currently receiving laser therapy treatments at our vet's office and needs leash walked to continue helping her knee to heal.\n\nPlease read on to learn more about this special girl!\nFrida is a young, mixed breed girl that is sweet, athletic, and loves to be entertained. She weighs in at just under 50 pounds. She is likely about 1 years old and seems to possibly be a Basenji / Husky mix but with shorter hair. (She is NOT hypo-allergenic). Frida can be a bit leery of certain strangers but warms up very quickly. She's fun, quirky, and very smart.\n\nIn her foster home, she has learned a lot of new commands and has been working on bell training to go outside. She is still having some occasional accidents, but has improved a great deal. Frida is very smart and knows which toys are which. If you ask her to bring the piggy to you, she will bring piggy! She loves to race around the yard playing fetch. She will require a securely fenced yard. She has proven to be an escape artist and adventurer, but NOT street smart. Fences + safety. Frida is doing well on leash and loves to ride in the car. She would do well with older children. She is dog selective and likely not good with cats. She may love to have a doggy friend in the home. Other playful, happy-go lucky types suit her best.\n\nFrida is spayed, up to date on vaccines, heartworm negative, and microchipped. If interested, please complete an application on our website at www.pawswapofgreaterlafayette.com/adopting. **Please, only apply if you have a securely fenced yard. Her adoption fee is $150.",

He was first spotted by a person just walking downtown when this dog was seen running through traffic darting cars and sadly clipped by one of them. They immediately contacted HARTT who ran out to try and find the pup and set up a food station. Luckily after a few hours, a Good Samaritan actually won him over with a cheeseburger and contacted HARTT. He was sent to Arizona Humane Society where he was checked to make sure he wasn't hurt and surprisingly he must've just got dirty from the tire, no injuries! Otto is a bit shy and un-trusting of men, but most of his handlers are men and he is doing amazing with all of them (nothing like some yummy treats)! Otto is about 3 years old, goofy, playful and loves toys. He is loyal and loves to go on walks and play in a yard.  He is social with most dogs who match his play style.  If you are interested in meeting Otto, please fill out an application on our website at www.azhartt.org/services/adoptions",

            "description": "Hi my name is Banjo. I am about 4, approximately 65-70lbs and I am looking for a home no fault of my own. My mom passed away and the good people at Paws Up said they would foster me and find me a forever home.\nMy foster Papa said I am a very good boy. I like to just lay around and keep your feet warm and wait for my next big boy dinner to be served. My favorite is to roll over for a belly rub. \nI do have some strict requirements. I need someone who is home most of the time. I really dont like to be left alone and i can be a bit of an escape artist.  I would need a large heavy duty crate for when you do leave so I dont start any shenanigans. I will also need a 6ft fence.  I really want to be with my people and when my people go I want to figure out a way to go to.  I would love nothing more then people that wanted to bring me every where!\nNow that we have the minor details noted and what will be required I can elaborate on all of my good qualities. I get along with cats, dogs, people and children. I like slow walks and I am excellent on a leash. I jump right in the car and love to go for rides. I am a handsome companion and excellent quiet company. \nSo pick me if your home all the time and need a loyal friend. Plus I am handsome boy with alot of love to give!\nThank you, Banjo xoxo\n\nAdopters must live within a 100-mile radius of Joliet, IL to be considered. The adoption fee is $250. This covers all shots, spay/neutering and microchip.\n\nTo be considered for this dog. Please fill out an application here: https://www.pawsup4rescue.org/dog-cat-applicaiton\n\nOur adoption process typically takes from one to two weeks. When you find an animal you are interested in, we ask that you fill out an application as a first step so we can determine if your family is a good fit for the animal. If you are, then we will contact you to arrange a time for you and your family to meet the animal so you can decide if it is a good fit. If you currently have dogs, we require that the dogs be present at the meeting to make sure it's a good fit all around. Once compatibility is determined, we move on to the paperwork and finalizing the adoption. \n\nIf the meet is not a good fit, we will keep your application on file for up to 1 year and we will gladly consider your family for another dog. \n\nFollow us on FACEBOOK: www.Facebook.com/PawsUp4Rescue/ \nand on INSTAGRAM: www.Instagram.com/Paws_Up_4_Rescue/",

Meet Brady, a sensitive, loving pup at a perfect size of 45 lbs.\nBrady was originally adopted as a tiny puppy from a public shelter and then dumped back into the public shelter when his owners moved. He completely shut down at the shelter and was terrified. It seems, that Brady had a hard life but he never changed his sweet personality. He was rescued from the public shelter at the last minute before being euthanized and he's starting to trust again. He is very friendly toward people he knows, loves to be pet, and not only loves treats but takes them very gently! He is crate trained which is a huge bonus and also does very well in the car! Brady is not the type of dog who is jumpy or energetic at first, he is calm in most situations. He is playful (but not super energetic) and likes to chew on bones. Brady has gone through some professional training to help him learn confidence (as he is more of the submissive type) and he's looking for a person/family who can continue to provide structure for him so he knows he won't be abandoned again. He's an amazing and loyal dog who has a bright future and would make an awesome companion for many! Brady is looking for a calm, adult household with access to a yard, no apartment/condo situations.\nThank you for your interest in adopting/fostering. Please make sure to read the dog's bio carefully. We get to know the dogs very well to make sure, they find the right match for their forever home. Due to limited staff during this crisis, please only contact us, if you meet the basic criteria listed in the dog's bio.

He is a 2 1/2 year old neutered male that is up to date on all of his vaccinations and ready to find a family to call his own.  He was found as a stray with Betty Davis.  These two definitely love each other.  They play tug a war with their blankets each night.  We normally find all of the blankets in Betty Davis Kennel the next morning.  They are too much! Buford is good with most dogs he has met.  He does tend to be more of an alpha so we think he would do best with a chilled female.  He has never been around cats so this is completely unknown.  He has been around kids of all ages and has done extremely well.  When we found Buford he had an injury to his back leg and he needed FHO surgery which stands for Femoral Head Ostectomy.  This is a surgery that aims to restore pain-free mobility to a diseased or damaged hip by removing the head and neck of the femur.  He did great with the surgery and now has made a full recovery!!!!! He is such a great boy!  If your family thinks you would be the perfect fit for this stunning boy, please email us at LongJ1003@aol.com.",

The family took Katie in and she gave birth to several puppies. Some of them died and some were given away. Donut and his sister Buttercup as well as his mother Katie, stayed with the homeless family. We were able to rescue Katie and Buttercup back then (who have been adopted) from the family but they refused to give us Donut, as they didn't want him to get neutered.\nFAST FORWARD: 10 months later, the homeless family decided to dump Donut at a kill shelter. Now, he was full-grown (about 100 lbs.) The children of the homeless family used to play with him and when the parents left Donut to be killed in the shelter, the kids were heartbroken. Fortunately, our rescue was able save Donut, the VERY DAY HE WAS GOING TO BE EUTHANIZED! He was absolutely TERRIFIED in the shelter. Donut didn't trust anybody at first. He has been at our rescue for a long time and would love to have his own home finally. He is a total goofball and loves to play with toys and even tried out our doggie pool! Donut loves to go for walks, he's great! He is a silly guy and would love nothing more than his own family with a house and a yard for him to roll in the grass. He gives great kisses and this goof-ball will make you laugh!\nIngrid\n(310) 480 6030\npcdrapps@yahoo.com",

            "description": "Handsome Donut went to hell and back: His mother Katie was found on the streets by a homeless family, scared and pregnant. The family took Katie in and she gave birth to several puppies. Some of them died and some were given away. Donut and his sister Buttercup as well as his mother Katie, stayed with the homeless family. We were able to rescue Katie and Buttercup back then (who have been adopted) from the family but they refused to give us Donut, as they didn't want him to get neutered.\nFAST FORWARD: 10 months later, the homeless family decided to dump Donut at a kill shelter. Now, he was full-grown (about 100 lbs.) The children of the homeless family used to play with him and when the parents left Donut to be killed in the shelter, the kids were heartbroken. Fortunately, our rescue was able save Donut, the VERY DAY HE WAS GOING TO BE EUTHANIZED! He was absolutely TERRIFIED in the shelter. Donut didn't trust anybody at first. He has been at our rescue for a long time and would love to have his own home finally. He is a total goofball and loves to play with toys and even tried out our doggie pool! Donut loves to go for walks, he's great! He is a silly guy and would love nothing more than his own family with a house and a yard for him to roll in the grass. He gives great kisses and this goof-ball will make you laugh!\nIngrid\n(310) 480 6030\npcdrapps@yahoo.com\nIf you'd like to meet this cutie, please fill out our adoption application: http://www.pcdogrescue.org/online_application.html",

            "description": "Diesel is a super handsome, 2 year old Great Dane who is coming to us because he was owner surrendered to a shelter. He is now with BDHP so that we can find him the right home. Diesel is house trained, crate trained, and he is learning not to pull on leash with a proper harness. He does not bark, dig or chew and he is good in the car. He needs slower introductions to other dogs so that he can get to know them but he is good with cats. As Diesel's foster family gets to know this guy a little better we will update his bio but we can tell you he is super sweet and a playful young man ready to find his happily ever after. In the meantime, he will be working on his basic manners and commands and confidence levels with other dogs while in foster care.\n\nGiant Breed Experienced Homes Only.\n\nTo see the most up to date adoption status of this dog, please visit www.bigdogshugepaws.com\nThis is just one of hundreds of gentle giants available for adoption at BDHPI! It is best not to get your heart set on any one particular dog upfront because there is no guarantee they will still be available once you are approved or that they are even the right match for your family. Purebred puppies are only eligible for adoption to giant breed experienced homes.",

Pei Land rescued her from a local shelter and took her immediately to the vet.  It was determined through xrays that Coco had been hit by a car and the break was left unrepaired for quite some time.  Due to that, the leg needed to be amputated.  She has recovered very well from the surgery and she is getting around great.  Coco needs some time to warm up to strangers.  But once she trusts you, she is a real sweetheart.  She is okay with friendly laid back dogs.  She is currently at our adoption facility in Plano, IL.  Coco\u2019s adoption fee is $295.00.

We don't know all the details of his life journey but we guess it wasn't an easy one. But Marley stayed sweet and he will make a great companion to just hang out.

Tonnie, however, had other plans for her life and found that roaming the countryside and visiting with children were much more pleasant ways to spend her time. As a result of this career choice Tonnie was tied to a tree 24/7 and eventually came to GPRW.\n\nTonnie was good with the male dog who lived with her on the farm. She was said to have chased the cats, but never harmed them. Both Tonnie and another female dog on the property did not care for each other, which is not abnormal for female Pyrs.\n\nTonnie will soon be fully vetted. Once she is spayed and brought up to date on immunizations she will be ready for a new home!\n\nIf you would like more information about Tonnie, or would like to schedule a time to meet her, please contact us at 920-293-8885 or wooflodge@yahoo.com. A fenced yard is usually required to adopt a dog from GPRW. All of our dogs are current on vaccinations and are spayed or neutered.",

She loves toys and easily entertains herself, and she runs in the backyard like she's practicing for track.

I was surrendered for having issues with the other dog in the household, but since being here at the shelter I have displayed no aggression and I have done well with both male and female dogs. I have also been tested with cats and showed no aggression toward them, but I was afraid to sniff nose to nose with it. I am highly treat motivated and I have shown interest in chew toys. I know my name and come when called. I'm still learning my basic commands, but I walk well on a leash and will need very little additional training when it comes to leash manners. If you would like to meet this handsome guy then come on in and see if we're a perfect match.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Sarge is searching for an owner that will not give up on him. He has been returned 3 times this year and is having a more difficult time trusting people. He needs an experienced and confident owner that is ready to train him through his reactivity and anxiousness around strangers as his behaviors have resulted in biting (leaving stitches on 1 occasion) when unaddressed.\n\nHe has shown no aggression towards my husband and I after being properly introduced. We are continuing to work on his confidence with having new people around and handling him but his owners will need to continue this process of proper introductions.\n\nWhen he trusts someone, he is full of sloppy wet kisses and wants his butt rubbed all day long. He is truly a huge goofball that just wants to give you affection. He loves to play and jump around but doesn't require a lot of exercise in order to settle down. He loves to play with well-behaved dogs after proper and slow introductions but would benefit from being an only dog for right now so his owners have more time to focus on training.\n\nHe was an owner surrender from Ohio where his family did not have the time to spend with him and exercise him. Sarge was adopted in April of 2020 and his new family loved him, but sadly, Sarge did not get along with the resident dog. Sarge was adopted in July of 2020 and recently turned to SSR again after starting to show aggression towards people.If you are an approved adopter and are interested in this dog, please let your case worker know. If you are not yet an approved adopter but are interested, please complete an adoption application!\nYou can review our adoption process, www.shenandoahrescue.org/adoption-process if interested.

            "description": "What is your name? Frisco!\nHow old are you? Between 1 and 2.\n\nHow much do you weigh? 80+ lbs, there is lots of me to love!\n\nWhat do you look like? I am a show stopper, a big handsome boy.  I have a nice tan and white coat and a big ole head. I even have eyeliner that highlights my stunning eyes.\n\nWhat do you like to eat? Chicken Soup for the Soul kibble. My most favorite treat is beef liver. Oh, and cheese! Maybe I am Italian?\n\nWhat kind of personality do you have? I'm a pretty laid back dude, with the occasional zoomies. I enjoy going for walks and am well-behaved on them. Foster mom calls me the Gentle Giant! \n\nDescribe your perfect day: I like to sleep in, and start the day with a morning walk to see what the neighbors are up to, then I have my breakfast followed by a snooze. After that I'll have some play time with my foster sister, followed by supper and an evening walk.  I like to wind down with some snuggle time on the couch with my foster fam.  It is the simple things in life that make me happy.\n\nWhat is your favorite toy? I enjoy my nylabone for chewing, and I have fun playing tug with a Jolly ball with a rope in the middle. I also like to chase balls and am working on fetch.\n\nDo you know any tricks? Yes! In addition to basic obedience commands like sit, down and wait, I also know how to shake with both paws and rollover! I'm currently learning \u201cLeave It\u201d \u201cPark It\u201d and \u201cDrop It\u201d when playing with toys.  The talented Mr Frisco! \n\nWhat scares you? Other than fireworks, not much. I can be a bit shy at first when meeting new pople, but get over it quickly.\n\nHave you been around children? Do you like them?  I haven\u2019t been around kids.  I think I would probably do best around older kids or kids who are dog savvy because when I get excited I forget that I\u2019m a size large beefcake.\n.\nDo you like cats? Cats?  I prefer a cat free home.\n\nHow do you feel about other dogs? I like other dogs!  I do still have some puppy energy and due to my size would be best with slow introductions and monitored play time until I can respect other dog\u2019s boundaries. Once I have a play buddy, I'm a rough and tumble player.\n\nIf you could be anywhere in the world, where would it be? With my family!\n\nHow is your health? I'm a young dude and my health is great.\n\nWho do you live with your foster home and who is your closest companion? I live with my foster mom and foster dad and some dog siblings. My closest companion is foster Mom cuz she gives me all the good stuff like food, treats, and walks. Dad is pretty cool too, we have play sessions every night.\n\nWhere do you hang out when you are home alone? In my crate. It\u2019s cozy.\n\nWhere do you sleep? Mostly in my crate. But sometimes I get to sleep on the bed with my foster parents. I'm a great sleeping buddy and don't hog the bed.\n\nDo you like walking on a leash? Yes! I'm a polite walker and don't pull much on the leash. I am a chill dude.\n\nDo you have any \"not-so-great\" habits that we should know about? For instance, do you bark or dig in the yard?  When I came to my new foster home I had some separation anxiety, but now that I am in a good routine I calm down quickly.  Hey, a lot of us need time to adjust to new things!\nI don\u2019t really like to share my food so I eat in my crate, it is an easy fix and makes me most comfortable.\n\nAre you house trained? (Meaning do you go potty outside) Yes I am, you can skip the dreaded puppy potty training w/ me.\n\nDo you like water? If you are talking about sprinklers, no thank you! But I\u2019ll step in a kiddie pool if it\u2019s hot out. \n\nWhat do you love about your foster family? They gave me time to adjust to my new surroundings and I have learned so much about being a good dog from them. \n\nWhat was your life like before being brought into NorCal Bully Breed Rescue? My guardian lost his job and was staying with friends who didn't want me around. My guardian felt he had to surrender me to the shelter. The shelter folks saw potential in me and reached out to NBBR for a foster spot. Luckily, a spot opened up due to an adoption. I am one lucky pooch!\n\nFrisco's adoption donation is $300\n\nNorCal Bully Breed Rescue is a foster based rescue with foster homes spread throughout the Sacramento area. We require our adopters to be within a 50 mile radius of us. \nThis is because we need to do a physical yard check to guarantee that the potential adopter's yard is secure, and also have them be close enough should any behavioral issues arise, and the assistance of our trainer is needed. \n(*FaceTime or Skype are NOT acceptable methods of communication regarding yard checks.)\nWe HAVE made exceptions for dogs that have been with us long term, and for senior dogs. We would still need to perform a yard check, and would be happy to do so for a dog that has been passed over repeatedly, but not for dogs that are in high demand. \nIt would need to be to a neighboring state to California. NOT across the country. That would be too much. \n(*We will NOT be making this exception for puppies or designer breed dogs, so please don\u2019t ask. It\u2019s way too much for us to have to request time off of work and lose pay to drive a dog out of area when we have plenty of great homes in our area wanting to adopt these dogs.)\nWe try our best to match our dogs to the perfect homes, and match them based on their personalities, not their looks. \nAdoptions are not done on a first come, first serve basis, rather in the order of what homes are the right match for that particular dog. \n\nOur adoption fees are based on the dog and typically range from $300-$500. Adult dogs are generally $300 and puppies are generally $500. \nIn the case of designer breed dogs, like French Bulldogs and English Bulldogs, the adoption fee will be significantly higher in order to offset the costs associated with their surgeries, or associated with their demand. \n\nIn the case of senior dogs (6+ years), fees will be waived to the right home. This includes spay/neuter, vaccines, microchip, and deworming (if necessary). \n\nInterested in meeting this dog or another one of our available dogs? Simply complete and submit our adoption application on our website www.norcalbullybreedrescue.org and we will generally respond to you within 3-5 days. Once a yard check is completed and you\u2019ve passed the adoption process, you\u2019re welcome to meet any of our dogs!!!\n\nIf you do not hear from us in 3-5 days, that dog has been adopted or has adoption pending. Unfortunately, due to the high volume of emails we receive for each dog, we are no longer able to personally respond to each one. \n\nThanks so much in advance for understanding!!\n\nAgain, thanks so much for your interest, and we hope we are able to match you up with your next family member!!!",

Just an old beat up pup wondering what the heck happened to his world and maybe even what the heck it means to BE a dog, Who knows what kind of life Connor has lived. But Connor made himself right at home at the rescue and as we get his skin in better shape and some order to his world he makes strides daily.  We are glad we got him out of the dog pound because he IS so old and quirky..  He is ornery and feisty and loves to pick fights with dogs. Only dog with a human who wanted a super senior dog would be wonderful, willing to provide TLC and watch him thrive.  Meade Canine will take any dog back for any reason at any time.",

I am completely blind, both my eyes had to be removed for medical reasons, but that doesn't stop me. I LOVE LOVE LOVE to play ball! I just play ball a little different than dogs that can see. My hearing is AWESOME, so I will follow you around the house or outside by listening to your voice or your foot steps. I am house trained, once I learn the lay of the house, I will go to the door and wait to be let outside to potty. After 3 weeks at my foster house, I was able to walk myself outside to potty and find my way back to the door with no problem.\n\nI am in a foster home with 2 other cocker spaniels, one is blind and deaf, the other can see and hear. I do tend to bump into other dogs, but my foster sisters are used to be bumped into so they put up with me.\n\nI know you will fall in love and want to snuggle once you meet me, \nFluffy\n****For adoption information, go to www,cockerkids.org**********",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Remi is a young dog with lots of love and energy and is looking for an active family. She will do anything for belly rubs and will thank you with loads of kisses.\n\nRemi was rescued with a shattered pelvis and is fully healed. She is looking for an active family as she loves going on runs and bike rides. Make sure you check out her videos to see this crazy girl in action. I'm sure you would never guess that not too long ago she wasn't even able to walk!\n\nShe loves playing with other dogs but after a little time of being properly introduced. She is a lot of dog piled into a tiny 50lb body so she would not be a good fit for families with small dogs, cats, other small animals, or small children (would prefer 8yrs and older). She is timid around new people but will warm up after given a few treats.\n\nShe has not been DNA tested but I would not be surprised if she is part Husky. She has many similar characteristics of Husky such as loving the sound of her own voice, being extremely stubborn, and having softer fur than a Shepherd (figured I would throw in a pro).\n\nRemi will need an experienced and strong leader to continue training her as she is very strong willed. She knows basic commands and takes treats gently. Prong collars are recommended as she is very capable of pulling you wherever she wants to go. Remi has shown food aggression specifically with her food bowl. She has barked and growled at multiple people that approach her while she is eating. She is working through this behavior but it isn't something that happens overnight so her owner will need to be willing to continue training. For this reason, she will not be adopted to a family with young children.\n\nRemi is looking for a family that will be a strong leader so she can become a well-rounded young dog. She is full of love and adores snuggling, getting belly rubs, and giving kisses. She is the sweetest dog and wants a family that will give her the structure she needs and that is willing to seek professional training if necessary.If you are an approved adopter and are interested in this dog, please let your case worker know. If you are not yet an approved adopter but are interested, please complete an adoption application!\nYou can review our adoption process, www.shenandoahrescue.org/adoption-process if interested.

This lovely ~6 to 7 yrs. old sweetheart, female Rottweiler is looking for a foster or forever home. Cleo is a gentle, very friendly gal who was abandoned and tied up on the Garden State Parkway in the heat! Rescue Ridge has stepped up to save her and she is currently waiting in her kennel for a kind person or family to make the rest of her days pampered and loved. Cleo will be going for surgery\nduring the next week or so to remove a large tumor on her stomach and to be spayed. We will know her medical information better at that time. Cleo loves everyone she meets and seems to be dog-friendly. She enjoys easy-going walks, loves to roll in the grass, and has no toy, treat, or food issues. She seems to be housebroken and keeps her kennel very clean. If you would like to foster or adopt Cleo, please apply at rescueridge.com and then text 732 546 8805 to let us know you did. Please consider helping us out by donating to her surgery. These are very rough times for us since all of our major fundraiser activities were canceled due to Covid 19. We really need your help in keeping us afloat to continue our mission to save as many homeless animals as we can and provide them with wonderful care. Please donate for Cleo on the Donate button attached here or on our website at https://www.rescueridge.com/donate-to-rescue-ridge Thank you.\n\nHere is Cleo in her video debut https://youtu.be/Unf9UaAaeCw",

See below for more details.\n\n*Due to state laws regarding out of state adoptions, we cannot adopt to families in Massachusetts or Rhode Island.*\n\n\n\nListed breed is an educated guess made by our veterinarian and is NOT a guarantee - this also means we have no way of knowing what a puppy's\u00a0adult size will be.\n\nDoc is an enigma. First let me tell you that he\u2019s a biter. He will bite your friends, he will bite your mother in law, and if you try to get him out of bed before 10:30 he will bite you. He\u2019s never broken the skin, but those nips hurt. He likes other dogs, but thinks he\u2019s the boss. He will bite any male dog that he meets even the 100 lb German shepherd that could snap him like a twig. He\u2019s never actually done any damage to another dog, but he doesn\u2019t back down until the other dog gets annoyed and snaps back. Then like most bullies he runs away. However... He gives the best cuddles. He loves to sit in your lap and watch tv or will lay along the back of your neck like a warm pillow. He loves to go on car rides and does great going on walks. He usually only bites people who come in the house or tries to pet him without his permission. He is a diva and demands to sleep in until 1030. He doesn\u2019t do well at the vet and hates taking medicine although he can be fooled with a bit of cheese. He is both an amazing dog and total jerk depending on his mood. He would though make an excellent friend for someone who needs a ferocious guard dog and doesn\u2019t like socializing.\n\nThis dog is currently being fostered in Mississippi and will be transported via Barton's Barkers transport services upon adoption. Their adoption fee is $450 and includes spay/neuter, age appropriate vaccinations, a nose to tail vet check, microchip and transport costs. Second Chances lists dogs as being available in White River Junction, VT because we transport our dogs to the area every 3rd week after they have been adopted. All of our local shelters have a high euthanasia rate due to overpopulation so we created our rescue group to primarily adopt to the northern states to help keep as many dogs as we can from entering our kill shelters.",

After receiving some much needed veterinary care, sweet Daisy is ready to be adopted! Daisy is extremely friendly and outgoing, she loves to be petted and is generally happy being where ever she can receive attention. She is good with other dogs as long as she is introduced properly (we do not know about cats). She is also good with kids and would be great for an active household. She knows some basic commands and learns easily. Daisy is spayed, current on shots, on heartworm prevention and crate trained. If you would like to adopt Daisy, please submit an adoption application by visiting our website at www.myhstc.org\n\nAdoption fee is $85 which includes all vet work\n\nWe prescreen all applicants prior to a meeting.

He was paralyzed. Daily physical therapy has given us hope that he may partially recover as he gains strength in his back legs, spontaneously stands on his own and can even take a few steps unassisted. He's always so excited to just GO that he often falls down and just scooches along.\nHe's a very happy-go-lucky kind of guy. He's playful and cuddly as well as being super well socialized with other dogs!\nThis pup does not have control of bathroom functions.  Baths will be required daily and Living area will have to be created, such as in a play pen where there is soft bedding that can be changed out  couple times a day.\nTo meet PuddyTat, apply at emotionalrescuemn. org.",

He is great with people and many dogs, but not all. Cats are a no! Boomer loves to go for car rides and would love to be a jogger or biker boy. He is strong and powerful but in the right hands, he could go all day either with you on foot or on a bike. This boy is made for the mountains! For more information, contact Jeannine at jeannine@dalmatianrescueco.org. Adoption $250. If interested in this dog, please go to www.dalmatianrescueco.org and submit an application for adoption.

            "description": "Sweet Mandy is a lovely little Dalmatian Wannabe (36 pounds) who was very frightened by all the noise and barking in the shelter in Texas. Picked up as a stray, neighbors said her kids threw rocks at her and yelled a lot. She was terrified and responded by chasing the kids. She is still very shut down but accepts gentle handling. So far, she's quiet and has met the resident dogs in her new foster home. She is lightly heartworm positive but will be starting treatment shortly. Mandy will be a sweet, loving companion once she has time to decompress and find out that everyone is not bad. She did well with shelter staff and the other dogs during play time. Mandy is mostly white with nice spots on her ears and lots of freckles under her white fur. A quiet home with all adults or teens would probably suit her best. For more information, contact Karl at karl@dalmatianrescueco.org. $250 If interested in this dog, please go to www.dalmatianrescueco.org and submit an application for adoption.

She has really come a long way since first arriving and in a home, we think she will truly flourish. We are currently looking for a foster or foster to adopt home for Gaia so we can learn a little more about her without the stress of a shelter environment.

She also didn't know that people were of much use, but she has learned all these things and more!\n\nCher was picked up by a shelter volunteer in a thunderstorm, wandering and scared. The shelter was scary, too, so she was placed in a peaceful foster home where she has become a new dog. She is a quiet, calm dog who thrives on gentle treatment and predictable routines. Cher will choose to come hang out with her people and watch for signs of a treat or a walk; she's an independent girl and not cuddly, but a quick lick from a girl like Cher is an achievement! \n\nWe're looking for a forever home for Cher where she can settle in and spend her golden years with her favorite things: the soft voices, the cushy bed, and a slow stroll around the neighborhood. She needs to be the only pet in an adult household and would not be suited for apartment living. If you'd like a peaceful, pleasant companion, please consider Cher!\n\nCher is currently in a foster home. Please email: foster@kcpetproject.org to meet me!",

It only took me one day to learn to trust and love my foster mom...I have a lot of love to give! I haven\u2019t had much experience on a leash, but amazingly I walk quite well on one.\nI ride great in the car.\u00a0\u00a0I enjoy my crate, it gives me security. I have plenty of energy and would like an active household that would take me out walking, hiking, or even running. I love to play and will fetch a ball and would get along just fine\nwith another dog playmate.\u00a0\u00a0I have not met a cat, but due to my breed mix, I would most likely chase one.\nKids would be just fine, but probably old enough to understand my playful nature that might knock over the younger ones.\nI am a gorgeous auburn color underneath my brindle stripes.\u00a0\u00a0You will be having to stop to let other people admire me when you take me out in public. A fenced yard is highly highly recommended due to my skittish nature and hound mixture.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My house manners are very good, too! \nTrust me, if you adopt me, you will wonder how you ever lived without me at your side! \ncontact irondawgs13@gmail.com for an adoption application",

            "description": "Ivy came to us at 3 months of age. She was surrendered to an area veterinarian by a puppy broker as she was considered unsuitable for sale. Gratefully, the veterinarian made sure she found rescue!\n\nIvy is an active, very happy 5 month old now. She is considered \"special needs\" as she demonstrates behaviors suggestive of probable vision issues and potential neurological issues. She is currently on the wait list with our veterinary specialists for a full evaluation and diagnosis, so more to come soon.\n\nBut none of that stops her from playing up a storm with her foster GSD sisters (or any other dog willing to play with her!) and it doesn't stop her from eating like there's no tomorrow, either.\n\nIvy is still ALL puppy, and still having to learn that sharp puppy teeth on human skin is a no-no. Her favorite thing in the world is to be a lap dog, and will cuddle for as long as you're happy to have a warm puppy in your lap! Her newly-discovered second favorite is puppy whips (whipped cream treats). \n\nWe are accepting applications for Ivy's adoption and will inform all interested parties of her diagnosis once known.\n\nIvy is up to date on her puppy shots until 1 year of age but does still need to be spayed, and that requirement will be included in her adoption contract.\n\nMeanwhile, this pretty girl is enjoying life to the fullest while playing with her foster siblings and lots of SGSDR \"aunties\" (canine and human alike) who give her foster family a few breaks from all those puppy teef! :-)\n\nOur Adoption Fees:\n-------------------\n\n*Dogs and puppies 12 months old or younger: $400\n\n* Adult dogs over 12 months of age: $350\n\n* Senior dogs over 7 years of age qualify for our \"Seniors FUREVER\" program! Seniors are special to us, so we offer two options: \n\n(1) If your heart has a special place for the seniors, you can adopt a senior dog for the regular adoption fee of $350 and this becomes a perpetual fee. You can adopt another SGSDR senior dog at any time from us in the future at NO CHARGE. \n(2) If you aren't sure about your future adoption capacity, you may adopt your SGSDR senior dog for a reduced adoption fee of $250.\n\nFor more information on adopting a Serendipity dog, please visit our website at any of the following links:\n\nhttp://serendipitygsd.org/adopt\nhttp://serendipitygsd.org/adopt/faqs\nhttp://serendipitygsd.org/adopt/seniors \n\nVisit us on Facebook for regular updates on all of our program dogs!  https://www.facebook.com/SGSDR/",

If that wasn't enough, we found that she is also diabetic. Despite her list of ailments, Zelda is still full of life and love. To say she is a tough cookie would be putting it mildly. This sassy lady has ENDURED! She took zero time to come out of her shell...she even started walking! She is feisty with the other Pugs when the spirit moves her, but really does get along with everyone. Zelda loves to be where the humans are and where the action is. If there is a grumble of Pugs playing or arguing you can be sure she will put herself right in the middle of the commotion. She insists on being in the know at all times! Although she loves other dogs, nothing makes her heart sing more than being in the lap or arms of a human, feeling cuddles and love. The smile that graces her face is indescribable. In addition to human attention, Zelda loves her toys and getting out for some fresh air and sunshine. Though not a candidate for long walks, we think she would do well in a stroller or a wheelchair of her own. Zelda is sometimes able to pee on her own, and does need to be expressed. She would also need a special diet (and special treats) to accommodate her diabetic needs. She is considered special needs and the love she has to give in return is well worth the extra effort and care. We really hope there is someone out there willing to open their heart and home to this extraordinary lady. We are confident that her bubbly personality is sure to keep you entertained!",

            "description": "Hello! My name is Noah and I'm fairly convinced I am actually a giant teddy bear. If you're on the couch you're gonna find me right there by your side so even if you're not into cuddles now, I'll make you a believer! You need to do some work at the computer? That's cool too, I'm comfortable just hanging out by your side on the floor for a nice snooze! My foster mom says I'm her favorite coworker!\n \nBecause I am not very confident in myself, I need a home with another dog to help me feel more safe. In my foster home I have lived with lots of dogs and puppies and I love each and every one of them! \n\nI'm still learning to be comfortable walking on my leash - but I do love a good romp around the fenced in yard with my foster siblings. I love to chase after balls and Frisbees and I'm great at sticking to only playing with and chewing on toys that belong to me! I also love going for rides in the car, they make for a good napping space. \n\nI can feel pretty uneasy when I meet someone for the first time, but don't be discouraged because I adjust pretty quickly! Although it can take me a while to warm up to new people, once I am comfortable with you, I will show you nothing but love! I met a human kid recently and it made me pretty nervous. I wasn't sure how to feel about him so my foster mom thinks that my forever home shouldn't have kids so I can feel safe. \n \nI know commands like sit and stay and know where I'm supposed to potty -- outside! That's why I'm known around the house as the \"\"goodest boy\"\". My kennel is my safe space, so if I am ever uneasy of a new person, I choose to go lay down in it. If I see someone brushing their teeth at night time I know that's my queue and walk myself straight to my kennel and get all cozied up in there for sleep! My foster mom is pretty proud of me that have made such great progress. I just love pleasing her! \n\nAt the end of the day I go to sleep dreaming of a family of my very own. Will you let me be your snuggle buddy? \n\n \n--------------------------------------------\n\n\nAll our Warrior Dogs will have all age appropriate medical care and vaccines, a microchip, and spay/neuter before adoption unless age is a factor with a puppy younger than 6-12 months at the time of adoption. If that is the case, the spay/neuter will be covered in the adoption fee and the owner will be responsible to have the procedure completed at a Warrior Dog Rescue Veterinarian at the appropriate time.\n\nPlease note that the majority of our dogs in rescue are from shelters where they have been found as strays or abandoned. Their breed description is based on our very best educated guess based on physical characteristics and their dispositions. If they came to our rescue as an owner surrender, the breed description will be listed as provided by the previous owner.\n\nAdoption Fee - $450\n\nTo apply for this pup, please submit an Adoption Application at http://warriordogrescue.com/adopt/adoption-application/",

Found as a stray in a neighboring town, the search began for the owner but sadly no one has come forward for him. He is a sweet dog and has joined the rescue to find a new home. He has been vaccinated and dewormed. He is heartworm positive so he will be treated prior to transport. He will also be neutered prior to transport. he is friendly with people and other dogs. He is a very sweet boy looking for a new home. He is scheduled for transport from GA on Feb 7th. Applications can be found at www.wagsrescue.com\n\nOur Adoption Area - WAGS RESCUE is based in BUCKS COUNTY. Therefore, a majority of our volunteers live in the Bucks County area. WAGS will consider adoption applications for people living in the BUCKS and MONTGOMERY areas. On a case by case basis (depending on distance and availability of our volunteers to do a home visit), we may consider applications in the PHILADELPHIA area as well as parts of CHESTER county.\n\nDue to a higher than normal volume of applications, we will not be doing any adoptions outside a 50-mile radius from Horsham Veterinary Hospital.\n\nThank you for your understanding.\n\nPlease call Colleen @ 267-238-7892 or Susan @ 267-312-3372. To begin the adoption process please, please fill out our online application. Go to wagsrescue.com and click on adoption form.",

She has had two litters back-to-back that we know of, and probably more. She was full of parasites and heartworms when we got her. Once she is spayed, she will need to go through heartworm treatment and needs a foster to help her through this. She will need to stay calm and inside, which shouldn\u2019t be hard since she is a very calm dog. She needs some socialization and someone to show her how to be a dog again. Cali is not good with other dogs (selective), but especially small dogs. She used to live around cats, but is unknown around children.\n\nIf you are interested in fostering Cali, please contact us at: info@colbertvetrescue.org.",

He was found as a stray on Broadway Avenue and he loves water which is how he got the name Scuba Broadway! He is a super super silly 3 year old little boy. He is really really smart and knows some commands ! He is an alpha male so he is not great with other male dogs . He does enjoy playing with females . He would not be good with cats as he is very interested in them. I think he would be find with kids as long as they were older because he is a big boy and super playful. Scuba is neutered, microchipped, vaccinated and ready for his home! If you think scuba ? would be a good fit at your home, please email us at LongJ1003@aol.com.",

He is very loving, mellow, very clean and in need of a wonderful home to spend the rest of his years.  He loves to be outside, but also inside giving and receiving affection.  He can be trained to be with other dogs as he is relatively non-reactive, but we prefer to find him a home where he can be a great companion.  He is very low maintenance.  He has no medical problems, passing all of his physical exams.  He is approx 8-9 years old, but in good shape.  He looks much younger than his age.  He would be a great house dog, not one to go on long walks although he probably could.  Please contact us for more information.",

We would recommend against small children due to her high energy and strength. In her foster home she doesn't mind the cats but, would have to be introduced properly in a new home. She also is living with 2 other dogs currently and is interested in playing but, would need proper introductions to new dogs.\n\nLucy is spayed, heartworm negative, vaccinated, and dewormed.\n\nAdoption Fee: $300\n\n***We require a complete and approved application prior to a meet n greet.***\n\nTo apply to adopt copy and paste the link into your search bar\nhttps://fs24.formsite.com/oneatatimek9rescue/form1/index.html",

ARPO limits adoptions to within 50 miles of Indianapolis. We do not have a shelter; all pets are in volunteer foster homes.\n\nBull Winkle would love to be your one and Only! Please check out his videos!\n\nBull Winkle (aka Willy) is a 8 year old beagle/Bassett mix and weighs 24 lbs. Bull Winkle can be fearful around new people and in new situations, but once he trusts you, he is affectionate and loving. Because of that, he'll need to be adopted by someone with dog training experience. He is looking for an adult only home where he can have all of the attention! He is very loving with his people, and would prefer to get all of your attention as the only animal in the home.\n\nBull Winkle was heart worm positive when we rescued him, and he has now completed treatment. He's neutered, microchipped and up to date on shots. We're still working on potty training; he has accidents occasionally. He is crate trained.\n\nHe\nis an active dog and would play ball all day long if you let him. He sleeps close at night and wakes you up with a ball being dropped in your face.\n\nBecause of his obsession with the game of fetching, it would be ideal for him to have a fenced yard.\n\nPlease consider giving him a chance at a wonderful life! He'll return the favor with lots of love\n\nOur adoption fees cover less than half of our medical expenses. We depend on the generosity of all our animal loving friends to help us continue to rescue these animals. Please help us with your on-line donation via Paypal by clicking on the icon below. We are a Paypal Verified site and it is secure.\n\nOr you can mail a check to: Alliance for Responsible Pet Ownership, P.O. Box 6385, Fishers, IN 46038.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting an ARPO pet, please complete the online Adoption Application.\n\nDue to recent coronavirus concerns, we have suspended our public adoption events until further notice.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.All of the animals posted on our site have been temperament tested. While not all are in the immediate area, once we have processed and approved your application, we will move the dog to our adoptive area for you to meet, greet and hopefully adopt. Sometimes we will have more than one application on a dog. That does not mean it automatically goes to another family but you should be aware of the fact that until you are approved and set up for the meet/greet.. the dog could get adopted by another applicant.NOTE- COOLI IS LISTED AS A COURTESY FOR ANOTHER RESCUE ORGANIZATION. PLEASE SEE CONTACT INFO BELOW.COOLI REQUIRES A FENCED YARD.Cooli is a loving, smart 2-year-old, 55 pound Pit mix. She is a BSL survivor rescued from the Prince George's County shelter where pit bulls are illegal to own because of the county's pit bull ban. She is waiting for her furever home now that she is out of the shelter. She has the cutest ear that loves to perk right up! She is a great companion that is looking for her person or people. She loves her people very much and likes to give kisses and will rest her head on your lap on the couch or wherever you are. She loves to go for walks and run around in the yard with a stick in her mouth waiting for someone to play fetch! She also loves her puzzle toys because she's a very smart girl! She takes her treats very gently too. She will need a family that is dedicated to exercising her regularly (walks, toy time, and yard time...hikes would be a bonus!). Due to her energy level, she will need a home with a fenced yard. Although Cooli loves people, she needs to be an only dog in the home so she doesn't have to share your attention. She has not experienced young children thus a home with no children or kids 11+ is needed. She is spayed, microchipped, up-to-date on vaccines and preventatives, and eager to find a family to love! If you are looking for an unconditionally loving, smart, energetic pup to bring into your family, Cooli is the girl for you! The adoption fee for this dog is $350 which includes routine vetting and spay/neuter. She is in Takoma Park, MD\n***Please note that our first step is submitting an application (it does not commit you in any way but allows us to discuss with you if you and the dog are a good fit). In addition, an important step in approving adoption applicants is to complete a vet check. Vetting of current and past pets is very important to us, thus we will be speaking with the vet(s) listed on your application to ensure that your current and previous pet(s) are kept up to date on vaccines (including rabies), spayed or neutered, maintained on appropriate monthly preventatives and examined annually by your vet.*** To complete an online application, please click HERE and email Kim at KLarimerlovepaws@gmail.com **If you're viewing this on Petfinder, please visit www.lovepawspg.org to complete our non-binding application.**",

She ran for four days, probably looking for her owner and eventually had to be trapped. Ariel is young and energetic, super sweet and gets along with dogs and is crate trained. She is fine with inside cats, also, but would probably need a dog buddy to keep her from needing to try to play with or chase the cats. She can still use some leash training and additional basic training.\n\nApply to adopt Ariel at hhfrescue.org.The adoption fee includes vaccinations, bordetella, deworming, rabies, spay/neuter, microchip, a lifetime registration of the microchip, and sales tax. If adopting a puppy, the rabies and spay/neuter will be done at the same time by our vet once they are 4 months old and billed to us. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.",

She came to us after a brave member of her family defied those she lived with and brought Dabai to us. We were stunned to find that Dabai, now Gracie, had large open wounds on her neck and face. She had been kept in a crate in a garage for months with a shock collar embedded in her neck. \n\nWith the help of a foster family, Gracie fully recovered physically and was o placed in a loving, permanent home with her beloved children and her best four-legged pal. No dog deserved it more.   \n\nBut now, her family's circumstances have become complicated and Gracie has come back to us through no fault of her own. Gracie is house trained. She does well with children and is used to having a male dog friend in her life. She is healthy, and her foster mother recently commented on how smart she is.. \n\nGracie is not to be crated due to her history, and she still shows fear of men wearing hats. Nothing aggressive. she is simply cautious, \n\nGracie has our hearts. Could she have yours?\n\nIf you would like more information about Gracie, or would like to schedule a time to meet her, please contact us at 920-293-8885 or wooflodge@yahoo.com. Gracie will need to have a fenced yard. All of our dogs are current on vaccinations and are spayed or neutered.\n\n",

            "description": "Thank you for considering adoption of a Milo Foundation Sanctuary dog. Our Sanctuary is where our rescued dogs who have had difficulty in a home in the past, have behavioral issues, or too much energy, or for some, aggression issues with other dogs, or intense stranger danger that make them more difficult to safely and happily live in urban environments. These are not beginner dogs or for the most part nor are they for families with children. IF you are looking for an easy dog to add to your family, we suggest looking at the dogs at our Adoption Center, Milo Pt Richmond. BUT, if you can offer a safe and nurturing home to a dog with some behavioral \"quirks\" please do send an application today. Thank you.\n************************************\nLocation: Milo Sanctuary Willits CA\n\nPono is an amazing dog! He is a sweet and cuddly, smart and is learning new things quickly. He wants to be a good dog and responds very well to verbal cues. Just a short \"no and he stops his behavior and looks at you, he is teat motivated. He is energetic but mellow inside the house and really loves to cuddle. He is very well behaved and hasn't chewed anything in the house. He is running free during the day and sleeps in his crate at night. He is house-trained, walks nicely on a leash and off-leash, can sit, lie down, wait for his meal, and comes when called. He can be left alone in his crate for 3-4 hours (MAX). He loves car rides and is always so happy to jump in and go for hikes. On walks he sticks with you and doesn't show prey drive. \n\nHe is dog-friendly and loves to play with other dogs when in an outdoor neutral zone. He has many dog friends up at our Sanctuary which is outdoors. \n\nHe is very affectionate and loves to hang out with me and my husband. When outside (even in the yard) he is friendly to people, but inside the house he is very protective. Dog-savvy people will know how to guide him to be a better host. He showed tendency to guard his food with other dogs, feeding separately is best. He CANNOT live with any small animals or other dogs inside a home.\n\nHe has been in my house just for a week and made such an amazing progress! This sweetheart can't wait to be adopted! \n\nPono is a very energetic, athletic and playful dog who loves to chase a ball! He is tremendously smart and very quick to learn, excellent on a leash, fantastic with other dogs and friendly when out in neutral places. He should not live with other dogs. He has some significant trust issues, so he is very protective of his house, people and property when it comes to anyone not in his inner circle. The ideal household would be with active, dog focused adults who have large-dog experience. He is sweet and affectionate with a lot of love to give. Pono is kid friendly out and about but can not be a family dog with kids in the home due to his over protective tendencies! He will need a human pal with lots of dog experience and no other kids or animals in the home",

While he is living in foster with two small dogs peacefully..he is NOT a fan of our larger dogs. (hes terrified and hen acts out) Cats are OK for him! . \n\nRoscoe is a LOVE...that is when he knows you and surely not on first meeting, and sometimes not a second either.. Give this boy time and he will be your forever always! \nHe is a tough little dog, but listens so well, cuddles, kisses wants to be near you, and can be with you no matter what your doing in the house or yard. He loves to sleep under he covers, and will worship the ground you walk on. \nRoscoe loves the kids in his foster home, but we feel its best no children as kids have friends, and that's not good for him to have a lot of people in and out of the house. \nFenced yard only because it will take Roscoe a few days to allow you to leash walk him. \nHe will need a very very dedicated and understanding owner(s) \nHe is neutered and UTD with shots. Just 8 pounds, and only a couple years old.\n\nAfter reading this if you think your right for him, please fill out the online application at wwwHomelessPawsNJ.org. and tell me why you think he will thrive with your family.",

            "description": "Also in need of a foster home ~ \nNMDOG TWIX is available for adoption. TWIX has many doggie friends & likes to have doggie playdates...but we believe TWIX would most enjoy being the only pup in the home. Cats are unknown. TWIX is super sweet & smart...making her a wonderful Breed AmbassaDog! She does great with children & is more comfortable around women than men. But TWIX is very brave & weve promised her that no one will ever hurt her again, so she has agreed to give human Gentlemen a chance :) TWIX enjoys walks along the Bosque & splashing around in her puppy pool! TWIX would love nothing more in the whole wide world than to have a FoReVeR loving home of her very own. #DogsAreFamily \n\nAs an all volunteer, foster based, 501(c)3 non profit rescue, NMDOG is always in need of new, approved foster & adoptive homes in order to continue our Mission: to serve & protect New Mexico's Forgotten Dogs!! \n\nIf you see a dog you are interested in that says \"in need of a foster home\", we are currently seeking a temporary foster home for that dog in order to provide them with the cozy & loving experience of a home environment while we work hard to find their forever family. This also frees up space & funds, which enables us to save another life. There is never a cost to foster for NMDOG & you will have the dedicated support of the NMDOG TEAM every step of the way. We take the time to really get to know the needs & personalities of our kids & we go the extra mile to ensure we make the best possible match...setting our dogs & their humans up for success! To learn more about the NMDOG foster program & to submit the foster application, please visit this link on our website - www.nmdog.org/foster\n\nOur adoption fee is $250 which includes; a 7 week NMDOG obedience/bonding class with their new family (classes are located in Abq & are also offered to our foster guardians), a complimentary vet wellness check & our dogs come with all of the supplies they need to get started on a trial adoption in their new home. All adopted dogs also receive free or discounted goodies & services from many of our awesome community partners!! Grooming, food, training, boarding, pet sitting & more. To learn more about the NMDOG adoption process & to submit the adoption application, please visit this link on our website - www.nmdog.org/adopt \n\nNMDOG doesn't cut any corners when it comes to the care & placement of our dogs. When a dog enters the NMDOG program, they are guaranteed to receive the very best of care. All of our available dogs have received a full medical & behavioral clearance prior to placement. They are (at the very minimum) spayed or neutered, UTD on age appropriate vaccinations, microchipped, dewormed, Heartworm tested & currently on HW/flea & tick preventative. Due to the nature of our work, many of the dogs we rescue need much more extensive care before they are cleared for adoption. At NMDOG, we stand by our dogs for life & we make a promise to always be there for them (& their people) should they ever need us. . \n\nPlease contact us directly via the links provided above or email info@nmdog.org with your interest in becoming a treasured NMDOG Foster Guardian or FoReVeR Guardian Angel to one of our amazing dogs in need!\nWe look forward to hearing from you & answering any questions you may have.

            "description": "Brodie is a smart, playful dog who was rescued from a south Texas shelter, where he was the longest resident. He was overlooked by adopters (probably due to being an energetic, big, black dog).\n\nThis 18 month old, 60 lb lab mix gets along great with other dogs (medium and large; his foster mom doesn't have small dogs) and enjoys chasing and wrestling with them. Brodie is an energetic boy who needs daily exercise (leash walks and/or interactive play time) to be his best self. He likes to play fetch (and will even bring the ball back to you!).\n\nBrodie is a friendly, affectionate pup who sits on his foster mom's lap. He rides quietly in the car and is house and crate trained. Brodie is very smart, focused, and food-motivated, so he's easy to train. No small children due to his large size and energetic nature.\n\nBrodie is neutered, current on vaccinations, and micro-chipped. He has been treated for heartworms.\n\nBrodie will be a terrific companion for a lucky person or family. If you'd like to meet Brodie, please complete an adoption application at www.legacyhumanesociety.org, and someone will contact you within a few days. His adoption fee is $275.\n\nAge: Approximately 18 months\n\nWeight: Approximately 60 lbs. We do not have a facility to house the dogs in our program. They are all kept in foster homes until they are adopted. Therefore, if you are interested in adopting from LHS, please complete an online application at http://legacyhumanesociety.org/adoptfoster/adoption-application/ and we will contact you asap about the status of your application.",

            "description": "Location: New Orleans, Louisiana \n\nBlue was a owner surrender to a shelter in Houston, Texas. Cane Haven Rescue pulled him from the shelter to give him another chance at life. Blue is approximately 2 years old, up to date on vaccinations, neutered & microchipped. \n\nHe would do best in a home with older children or children who can understand boundaries. Blue would do best in a home without any other pets.\n\nBlue is house trained, kennel trained & knows his basic commands/manners. He is an extremely strong boy who sometimes does not realize how strong he actually is. He absolutely loves sun bathing & relaxing in his foster home. \n\nInterested adopters can fill out an application at canehavenrescue.com. \nAny possible questions about Blue, please email canehavenrescue@gmail.com \n\nCane Haven Rescue will transport any of their adoptable dogs to the right home. We do require adoption fees that are based on the age & health status of the adoptable dog. The adoption fee covers every single dog in CHR with vaccinations, heartworm test, deworming, microchip, spay/neuter & medications. All CHR adoptable dogs are current on their monthly  heartworm and flea medication. A CHR representative will do a home check to ensure the pets are placed in a secure and loving home. \n\nwww.canehavenrescue.com",

Ingrid is good with docile cats and submissive dogs but doesn\u2019t take too fondly to the dominate ones. She loves people and just wants a family of her own. Ingrid would do best in a home with a fenced in yard and a semi active lifestyle. She\u2019s older but has a ton of energy. She would also like a home where someone is home the majority or the time and would do best with older children.\n\nUnfortunately due to Ingrid coming from a neglected past, she has tested positive for Heartworm. The good news is, that she doesn\u2019t seem to be affected one bit ! The rescue has chosen to treat her with a non invasive method and any adopter will he provided with her medication that she just needs to receive monthly. Because she is on the older side she also has some aches and pains. She will need a joint supplement and anti inflammatory medication.\n\nFor an application to foster or adopt please visit snarrnortheast.org\n\nIMPORTANT: This dog has not yet been altered. For any dog or puppy that is not able to be spayed/neutered prior to adoption, SNARR requires a $125 deposit in addition to your adoption fee, as well as a signed Spay/Neuter Contract stating you will have this dog altered within 6 months of adoption. The $125 deposit will be returned once the contract has been fulfilled. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $425 for adults. Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary.\n\n",

            "description": "Thank you for considering adoption of a Milo Foundation Sanctuary dog. Our Sanctuary is where our rescued dogs who have had difficulty in a home in the past, have behavioral issues, or too much energy, or for some, aggression issues with other dogs, or intense stranger danger that make them more difficult to safely and happily live in urban environments. These are not beginner dogs or for the most part nor are they for families with children. IF you are looking for an easy dog to add to your family, we suggest looking at the dogs at our Adoption Center, Milo Pt Richmond. BUT, if you can offer a safe and nurturing home to a dog with some behavioral \"quirks\" please do send an application today. Thank you.\n\nSweet, but conflicted little guy previously adopted in 2013 - Peanut is deaf and selective of his friends both two and four-legged.\n\nPrevious bio, \"Phoenix has gone up to our Sanctuary for a bit to get a break from being kenneled! He is such a sweet boy - playing fetch and running about - yes, he's deaf and a bit OCD - but he is a wonderful companion - bright and cheerful - eager to please and take part - and to have fun!! Phoenix is a very sweet, active and unique fellow. Alert, watchful - and deaf. He has a small bit of hearing - but not much. He is bright and attentive and will learn hand signals readily - he needs structure, lots of activity and perhaps a playful, active mentor hearing dog. A vibrating collar can also be useful with a deaf dog - but cattle dogs are so rugged and sturdy and able to figure their way around problems we thing young Phoenix will manage just fine with herding breed savvy folks!\"\n\nNo kids, MUST have dog experience, stranger danger",

She's going to remain a little jumpy and skittish, so her adopter should be familiar with that type of personality.  She's very willing to please and learns new things quickly.  She's affectionate and gets along with male and female dogs her size, as well as cats.  She enjoys snooping around the yard and will be playful once she gets comfortable in a new home.  She's housetrained, crate trained, and is doing good with leash training.   She is really a people dog, but would probably do best in a home with a compatible canine companion that she can gain confidence from.  No big dogs and no small children please.  Petra's adoption fee is $200.  LOCAL ADOPTION ONLY.\n\nThis dog may be at one of the Prescott pet stores on Sat. If you're interested, please call in advance to confirm that we're bringing this dog and where we'll be. Call for more info. 928 708-0799.\n",
