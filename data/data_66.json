I love to play ball and catch frisbees, go for hikes and snuggle on the couch.  My perfect family would be active and  would take me on lots of outdoor adventures. I would prefer to be the only dog in the home; but, could live with another canine IF he/she doesn't try to steal the limelight (or my humans) from me.  Cats are no-go as are small/young children (< 12 yr of age). I am house-broken, crate-trained and I walk pretty good on a leash (but, I'd rather run).  I am spayed and up-to-date on my vaccinations.  If you are interested in meeting me, please contact kathie@herdinghaven.org",

I would sooo much like to find my true forever home where I can spend time with my humans and possibly fur siblings (I gave a lot of self confidence with other dogs around me).\n\nMy ideal furever home would be a calm household with a wondaful fenced yard for me to explore! I don't like being bumped around (there are 3 other dogs in my foster home and I handle it well, but I don't really want to play with and they sometimes won't understand that I just want my peace). Like all seniors, I have a few medical needs that will have to be tended to!\n\nDo you want to know what I like? Couches and dog beds, anything cozy and comfy... I enjoy belly rubs from people I am comfortable with people and I love butt scratches. I get very excited to be dried off with a towel - that's like getting a massage! If I'm feeling really wild I will occasionally play with toys and fetch. I don't like to share food and toys and enjoy slow strolls and sniffing around the yard. I am good with kids, but older kids may be best, as they need to be considerate about my pain issues ...\n\nI would soo like to have my very own bed next to my very own person in my final home!",

I am about 5.5 years old, 24 lbs.\nIf you were wondering a few things about myself for one you can tell by my photos that I only have 1 eye, because of this I would really appreciate if you didn't pick me up from behind without me seeing. I am potty trained but I do need to be let out if you don't have a doggy door available.I would do best in a home with a nice backyard as I enjoy exploring outside. I don't mind where I sleep at night a comfy blanket will be just fine but I'd like to sleep with you if possible. I'm a very fast boy so watch when you open the door. I'm relentless with my toys but if you don't feel like playing with me I'm perfectly fine playing with another dog or myself. I love treats and cats(for some reason they don't like me back).I love cats but I think it's best I don't live in a home with them. I will do best in a home where my people are home a lot and I would love to have a human sibling but they should be over 8 years old. I would also do well with a dog sibling as long as they are female and not too bossy. If you are up for my funny personality and occasional human food stealing I'm the perfect doggy for you!\n\nMax Uno's Adoption fee is $325\n\nThank you for your continued support in our rescue efforts!If you are interested in any of our Boston Terriers or would like to be eligible to adopt a Boston Terrier through our rescue in the future, please fill out an application.

Puppies were born 10-28-2020 and are currently 8 weeks old.  The 3 whites are all girls and the boys all have masks.  \n\nWe require 6 foot fencing and no young children due to escape tendencies of this breed.  Huskies as a breed are escape artists, high prey drives, and dont prefer to mind their owners.  They can be energetic and require exercise.  They require to remain on lead when not in contained areas so are not a breed you can taking hiking or walking off lead.  Also as a breed they are social, loving, and smart.  We are looking for homes that can keep them safe and manage the breed traits of a husky, and manage any of their needs throughout their lifetime.\n\nWe believe they are purebred huskies, but really don't know for sure as we don't know who dad was.  Whether purebred or not, they favor the husky breed and therefore the breed specific requirements apply.\n\nAdoption fee is $400 plus a spay or neuter deposit of $100 that is returnable once we are provided proof of spay or neuter.\n\nPlease send inquiries by email only to goliathmountainrescue@gmail.com.",

There are many great things about him, but let's be real first. He is a BITER, and has a bite history. Hammer Bro tends to guard toys, treats, and food depending on what he sees is of high value. If you put your hand near where he is guarding he will bite you. He prefers not to have people in his face and not to be smothered. He needs a family who understands him. Hammer Bro loves his treats and once he gets to know you he loves his butt scratches too. He can be very calm in the home, but also playful and loves his walks. If you think you can give this adorable guy a forever home lets chat more about him!\n\n\n adopt or to receive more information, please fill out an application on our website at www.libertyhumane.org/dogs.

Diamond is my only dog from start to finish. 6 years ago we were called to assist the sheriffs department in a cruelty seizure. Come to find out we were doing the seizure and they were doing the arrest. When Diamonds pyshical condition didn't improve in the shelter we asked to foster her and secretly vetted her out of our personal money. You have to understand when they are a court case the shelter is only allowed to do the basics. \nThe day the county won custody of Diamond we immediately pulled her into For Bullies Sake. 6 months in rescue after completing heartworm treatment and looking like a poster child for the American Staffordshire Terrier we adopted her to what we thought was a wonderful family that passed all checks. The couple separated this year and Diamond fell victim yet again. Landing in a shelter after being found as a stray and givin away without even checking her for a microchip.  We got her back in less then diserable condition.  Our Diamond is resilient though and has thrived. \nShe really needs a wonderful forever home. \n Yes she's around 8 yrs old but she's healthy and happy. Fully house trained. Perfect home would have a submissive male or be a only baby home. No cats. Fenced yard preferred as she pulls on a leash. She is fully vetted and heartworm negative. 100.00 adoption fee located in Picayune Ms  can have her transported for the perfect home",

            "description": "Rescue favorite Chomp is officially ready for adoption.  Chomp came to us 6 months ago with his ear ripped. Someone attempted a at home repair with a stapler and fishing line. He was also heartworm positive. \n Chomp has been a ambassador for the breed though despite what he has been through. He is full of love to give and is very clingy and needy but who can blame him. Hes been tossed around and was dumped at the shelter when he needed a good owner the most. \n Chomp is almost perfection. He loves everyone he meets. Hes good with all size dogs and has even been around a cat and a tortoise. Hes a very chill dog for the most part. \n However he has major separation anxiety. He does need a escape proof crate. He will absolutely need to be crated when unattended. We are willing to provide his 250 dollar crate if its necessary to find him a good home. \nHealth wise he does have allergies and is currently on allergy shots. He has been treated for heartworm,  neutered, microchipped and utd on shots. He is guesstimated at 6.5 yrs old (best we could guess as hes missing most of his teeth and what he does have has been broken and filed down most likely from chewing on a chain all his life. Unfortunately we see this a lot in rescue).\nChomp is located in Picayune Ms with For Bullies Sake rescue. Because of his anxiety I am not willing to put him on transport. 150.00 adoption fee and excellent homes need only apply. Pm the rescue page to see if Chomp is right for you.",

Initially very scared and snippy.  He will NOT be a fit for homes with young children.  They will scare him and we would like to keep both the children and the dog safe.  Thank you for understanding.\n\nThis dog is heartworm positive but please do not rule him/her out because of it. There's a treatment that is not as hard on the dog as the one you may have heard of and it's FREE.\n\nWe answer all emails back within 48 hours. Please watch your spam folders as an application will be attached and this sometimes places it in there. \n\nHIS/HER adoption fee is $550 USD and that will pay for TRANSPORT, all his/her shots up to date, neutered/spayed, microchip and rabies.\n\nPlease e-mail MuttsAndMeows@Mail.com for an adoption application. \n\nThis dog is currently in the Houston Texas area.  Once the application is approved and adoption fee paid, transport will be arranged.\n\nBecause this adoption will be without meeting the dog first, we will need to try to be extra careful that everyone (including you) think this will be a good fit.  We will try to give you as much information about the dog as we can.  Unfortunately, many are fresh from the shelter and we don't know much about them yet. \n\nLike us on Facebook - search Mutts & Meows - and help even more pets find loving homes.",

            "description": "Meet Charlie Crews, a 2 year old, 42 lb, extremely handsome, special needs English bulldog. He is neutered, up to date on vaccines, micro-chipped, on heartworm prevention, and crate-trained.\n\nHe is incontinent.\n\nCharlie is a strong, intelligent guy with a BIG personality. He's an expert communicator and will growl/bark when he needs your help retrieving a toy from under the furniture. He also regularly picks something in the house to be bothered by and will growl/bark at it until you take care of it for him (e.g. the robot vacuum chasing him as he jumps in front of it or an object that has been sitting in the same spot for days and he's tired of looking at it). Don't let that smooshy face fool you though, he's a happy guy. He makes us laugh every day.\n\nCharlie is a typical bulldog - charming and stubborn. He can be very, very sweet and cuddly with people (doesn't mind being picked up and enjoys belly rubs), but he will also bite if his toy is taken from him or he's rough housed with. He loves his toys and will hunch over them and wrap his paws around them to protect them. He lives with several other dogs, big and small, in his foster home and he is friendly with all. However, he thinks he's a lap dog and will fumble over people and other dogs to make himself comfortable. For these reasons, Charlie will not be placed in a home with small kids and we prefer his forever family have bully experience.\n\nCharlie's foster mom spotted him posted for sale online a few months ago, likely a failed breeding prospect due to his 'vertebrae issue.' His x-rays showed 2 vertebrae that are fused. Although he is very mobile, it would be best for his future home to have little to no stairs. He can jump on the couch, but usually pulls himself up with his front legs.\n\nCharlie is incontinent. He has some control to pee outside. We use belly bands with male incontinence pads to keep him clean and dry. Especially when it's warm out, he will express his own bowel movements outside when he kicks after peeing, so we don't do a full diaper and just clean up any indoor accidents as they happen. He's also on Kin+Kind supplements for bowel and urinary health support.\n\nAs you can see, he has a large wrinkle on his face that requires regular cleaning. As a special needs dog, Charlie requires a little extra effort, but it's manageable and he is totally worth it. He loves to take a bath and will even jump in the tub for you. He just needs a family committed to maintaining proper hygiene and his lifelong care.\n\nCharlie is being fostered near Abingdon, VA and his adoption fee is $400. If you're not afraid to take on a special needs guy who will pay you back with all the love he has to give, contact his foster mom Amber at amber@bostonterriertn.org or apply to adopt at www.bostonterriertn.org.\n\nNOTE: Submission of an application and fee does not guarantee adoption of any specific Boston, since that particular dog may have applications pending or may not be the right match for you.\nPlease use the foster momma or dad's contact information above for questions.\nThe process always begins with an application which can be found at The Boston Terrier Rescue of East Tennessee website\nNote that in most cases, we do not adopt to families with small children, e.g., 'under 6,' as a precaution to the child's safety and the dog's safety. In some cases with larger Boston mixes or other dogs, we do make exceptions. Please ask the foster momma.\nWe prefer to place dogs within driving distance of where they are being fostered. If someone from outside the local area is approved for adoption, they must be willing to personally drive/fly to get the dog. The East Coast division (NC/SC/VA/MD/DC) does have special transport capabilties for their kids. Ask them.\nAlso, submission of an application and fee does not guarantee adoption of any specific Boston since that particular dog may have applications pending or may not be the right match for you.",

            "description": "Crisp is a 5 month old, neutered American Pit Bull Terrier mix puppy. He was taken to the shelter by his prior owners when they discovered he is deaf. Crisp's foster mom brought him into the Legacy Humane fold to teach him sign language and give him a second chance at a forever family. He knows signs for sit, no, good job, come and eat. He is working on wait/stay and off. Crisp loves to be played with, enjoys belly rubs, and is very social. He is very good at fetch and LOVES to cuddle with his people.\nPuppies at this age will require patience and training to become the best pup they can be. Crisp will need a family ready to learn how to train and communicate with a deaf puppy.\nhttps://deafdogsrock.com/ is an awesome resource for adopters of deaf dogs! Deaf dogs are trained in similar ways as hearing dogs!\nHere is a great YouTube channel called Deaf Wiggle Butts that has wonderful videos that could be helpful!\nhttps://m.youtube.com/channel/UCNOPu3T62P0Xfo8Z5aAtQhACrisp is 95% house trained! (A rainy day may throw a kink in things still!) Crisp is energetic and will need a family with enough time to engage in play and exercise.

            "description": "Meet this handsome fella named Dingo! He came in mid December 2020 and is patiently awaiting his FOREVER home. He is such a sweet and handsome boy who is full of happiness and love to share. He is around 1 year old, current on shots, and seems to like most female dogs he has met.he does play hard. He needs a special home that can be cautious with him when feeding (put food in bowl and leave him to enjoy & pick up bowl when he is away and done. Use caution whenever  food is around. He is very protective of his food and so he needs to have a safe spot to eat. Also with this a home without young kids since they sometimes carry food in their hands and he could try to grab it out of their hand and hurt the child not intentionally.  We are working with him to take treats gently and that he doesn\u2019t have to worry about being fed. (I personally have a dog that had issues and is now 10 yo and it\u2019s better but the protection of food is still there. I still can\u2019t let my guard down to set up for an accident to happen.)  Dingo is super happy and loves to run and play and soak up body rubs and affection from his human friends. Such a sweet boy who deserves to loving FOREVER home to call his own. Maybe you have the most amazing home for this charming fella that is perfect for what he needs. Stop by the shelter for a visit with Dingo today! \nIf you have another dog and are interested in meeting another potential new furry member please bring him or her to the shelter and meet on neutral ground before adopting. No need to shuffle the animals around any more than necessary. Please know that 1 mosquito bite can create heart worms and they can be fatal if not treated. It is VERY important to keep your pets healthy and protected by keeping them on a once a month heart worm and flea/tick prevention. These animals are counting on you as their owner to provide them with lots a love and the proper health care so PLEASE make sure you are aware and prepared before adopting. Owning a pet is an extra expense and responsibility but is so worth every minute and penny you invest in them. They will add lots of joy and unconditional love if given a fair chance.\nThe shelter is open Mon.-Fri. 10-1, 2-5 and Sat. 10-4. Adopt a homeless pet and save a life. If you can not adopt right now come out and volunteer and make a difference in the lives of these animals while they await their FOREVER home.",

He is good in the car, crate trained and knows to do his business outside, but please remember to get him out often as this builds good habits and his habits need a bit of improvement. He enjoys taking you for a walk around the neighborhood and is an early riser. CB is very friendly with both dog and people and loves everyone. Friends is his favorite tv show and makes perfect sense for this guy. However, he is very possessive and doesn't enjoy sharing his human with others. For this reason, we believe he will do best in a single-owner home or with a couple that is ready and equipped to teach him to how share. But don't let this deter you- he is a very sweet boy who loves to cuddle and receive head scratches. He likes to play hide and seek and has been known to move your hats, sandals, and sneakers to your new favorite spot!",

DUCKEY IS COURTESY POST-PLEASE CONTACT - christen.anderson.fitness@gmail.com FOR MORE INFORMATION ON DUCKY!\nMy name is Ducky, it's silly and definitely suits my goofy personality. I love to play tug-o-war, am excellent at fetch, and enjoy walking the trails on a hike. I really enjoy being outside in the sunshine and prefer a home with a fenced-in yard where I am safe to run and play. I have a lot of healthy energy but am just as content napping indoors when you're not home. I'll thrive in a single pet home, where I am the only baby (fur or otherwise -no children).\nAdditional information about Ducky: Ducky is looking for a new home after his current family of nine years discovered he doesn't interact well with other family pets and young children. In those nine years, Ducky has been a loved family pet that brought so much laughter and many memories. Ducky has been wearing a muzzle full time for over a year due to issues with food aggression/ aggressive behavioral issues. He does not have any health concerns and does not require a special diet.\nMessage from family-\nWe love Ducky dearly, he was our first baby. We've loved him for 9 years and absolutely hate that he no longer is thriving in our growing family (young children). Our heart is broken at the thought of rehoming him, but we know that Ducky deserves a home where he is cherished, safe, and free to be his quirky self. Ducky will be rehomed with a supply of his favorite food. Our family just wants to see Ducky in a new home that will love him as we do. We recommend placement in a single-pet, child-free home. 2/2/21 3:35 PM",

We thank you for your understanding. The adoption application link is posted below and the adoption process is outlined on the website.  Animatch asks that you read the Adoptee\u2019s bio in its entirety before applying to ensure you meet the requirements for the dog.\n\nMy name is Thinsel and I choose to believe that better days lie ahead. Life is finally good for me and it is getting better every day as I am pampered with nutritious food, clean water, and best of all cuddles that make me feel warm and loved. At this time, I don\u2019t have the tolerance for other dogs; since I\u2019m not yet in tip-top shape, their goofy antics just annoy me. For that reason, I would thrive in a home where I was your one and only. I weigh 28 lbs and I should be at least 50. I was found and brought to Animal Control by a Good Samaritan who made it their business to help me out. My feet were bloody, I was exhausted and lethargic, and I was in desperate need of food and water. No one claimed me so the good people at Animatch welcomed me with open arms. I\u2019ve been promised a new beginning filled with unconditional love and care. I\u2019ve got some mending to do \u2013 I am anemic and severely underweight. At this point, I need a quiet, low traffic home, where I can enjoy a walk or two, relax and let my body heal, and benefit from some well-deserved attention. I am 7 years old and my dream is that my next 7 years will be shared with a human who can make up for lost time. If you have a home to offer me; I\u2019m ready to be your dog. I\u2019m looking for a long-term, serious relationship. Please fill in the Adoption Form if you want to adopt me.\n\nBreed:  Husky-x\nSize:  Large (28 lbs, should be 50)\nAge:  7 years\nGender:  Female\nGrooming:  Low\nEnergy:  Medium\nChildren:  10 and over\nCat friendly:  No\nDog friendly:  Yes (but selective; prefers being only dog)",

We took him into our rescue so that he can finally have the wonderful home that he deserves. Merry Christmas, Remi!\n\nHe is GREAT with people, and gets along with other dogs too. \n\nWe will provide him with the heartworm treatment that he needs and then he will be ready to go into a loving home as a beloved indoor pup!\n\nInterested in adopting?

My name is Bella, and I could be the girl of your dreams.\n\nI am a 9-year-old Lab/Shepherd/Husky mix who is extremely chill with a passion for people and strolling through the neighborhood.\n\nI spend most of my time lounging with and loving on my humans. But I do cherish my daily walks. I love to wander for two to three miles each day, and if I miss my walk, I can be a little antsy.\n\nI love to meet new people and pups, but I haven't been around any kids. I could live in an apartment that doesn't have stairs, as long as, I get my walks. I do have diabetes, but insulin injections twice a day and diabetic dog food have helped me keep things in check. I'm not a huge fan of the shots, but I do love to please my people, so if you give me enough love, I'll usually cooperate. That medication can be expensive - about $25 per month for insulin and $100 month for my special food. \n\nBut I'm totally worth it because I am generous with my love and affection. I love to be outside, especially when it's cold, and I'd probably benefit from training, as sometimes I can be a bit stubborn. I am, at heart, happy to do what my people want because I just want a pack I can call my own.\n\nDogs are not placed on a first-come, first-serve basis. We strive to find the perfect home for each animal. Applications may take up to 48 hours to process.\n\nAll CAWS animals are fixed, microchipped, and vaccinated. Her adoption fee is $200.

            "description": "Faith is a 2 year old female that will be spayed once she is brought up to her correct weight and health status. She is a pocket Mal and currently weighs 30lbs and stands just at 24 inches tall. She comes from an abuse/neglect situation where she was left in a kennel with with no food and certainly no human interaction. \n\nShe is skittish of new people and situations but does bond quickly to anyone who will give her treats, time and affection. Her foster has been training her on how to just be a dog while learning some commands and leash manners. She is currently not house trained, but has no issues being crated in the house for the night. She has very high energy but has no ball or toy drive to speak of. Although she was almost starved to death she has not shown to be food aggressive. Since food is such a high value for her she does snatch food and treats from people's hands. Her foster dad is working on her manners so this should self correct in time. She is fed separately away from the other dog in the home so she can peacefully enjoy her meals. \n\nFaith has been safe with her foster's working K9 partner when left alone, but due to her small size could easily be bullied by other dogs. The food deprivation has made her prey drive much higher than normal so she is not allowed to interact with the cats or other farm animals at her foster's home. She would not be a good match for a home with cats and/or other small animals. Faith has been on a 15 foot long line when outside on her foster's farm, she has never tried to run away but being left crated for 2 years she is very inquisitive about new things. She will always follow her foster when he gets too far away from her on the farm. \n\nFaith would do well with a first time malinois owner, or someone that has a softer more submissive dog that will not bully her. She deserves a lifetime commitment from her forever family that will simply show her how fun it is just to be a dog. And treats, don't forget the treats!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please complete an application at this link https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/24689/generic . \n\nWe are an official 501C3 organziation that does not have a physical location. Our home address is in Michigan, however, the majority of our dogs are not located in Michigan. The physical location of each our our dogs is posted with the name of the pet or in the title area. If you are within 4 hours of the pet, please be prepared to pick the pet up. We do provide transport assistance, however, the applicant must drive 50% of the total distance of the transport. \n\nThe information that we have available is in our posting. If you would like to discuss this animal additionally please fill out this application. Applications that are completed in our process and being considered as a match will speak to the foster home to gain more information about our adoptable dog.",

Coco may have limited sight due to an injury in her right eye but is otherwise healthy. Coco is somewhat sad and a bit nervous in the kennel environment. Her previous owners stated that she developed anxiety after having lost her fellow dog friend and that she was no longer happy in their home. Coco may do better in a home with another dog or where someone in the family works more from home.\n\nCoco is available for our Sr. to Sr. dog program to qualified adopters. Please come and visit me at the Adoption Center inside PetSmart in Midland, TX! \n\nCheck out all the currently adoptable pets on www.midlandhumane.org/adoptables",

If you are a good fit for the animal you are interested in -we will call to speak with you, If we feel you are not a good fit , we will contact you about other pets that may be a good fit for your home. Many people are losing the opportunity to adopt the animal they want because they fail to put in an application and the pet was adopted before we could answer your email. .If you have applied for an animal in our facility and have not received a response within 7 days, PLEASE call or contact us again. Though we do our best in trying to answer all emails in a timely manner, sometimes things get away from us, get lost or misplaced.

Apply today to meet Superman.\n\n__________________________________\n\nIf you are interested in meeting a dog or cat, we require an adoption application. If the animal has \"HAS APPLICATION\" listed, they are still available to receive additional applications but also may be in the process of being adopted soon.

We do not have a shelter. We focus on local adoptions in DC and the metro area of Maryland and Virginia. CDR&CK has a thorough adoption process in order to find the best possible fit for each of our dogs and cats (we do not operate under a first-come, first-served model).\n\nUpon accepting a new cat or dog into the organization, we provide a basic vet visit that includes necessary vaccinations, disease screenings, deworming, microchips, and spay/neuter (unless specified). We do not provide a comprehensive medical exam prior to adoption. As a result, sickness, injury, and disability may exist unbeknownst to CDR&CK. City Dogs Rescue & City Kitties is not responsible for payment of any vet care, including known and unknown medical conditions once a cat or dog is adopted from us. \nDog specific: Rabies, DHPP, Bordatella vaccines. They are tested for HW, Lyme, Ehrlichia, Anaplasmosis.\n\nMost cats and dogs will have a house training accident in the initial days in their new home and we cannot guarantee any pet is housebroken or crate trained.\n\nWe also update our Facebook page daily with new cats and dogs.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\nSweet Pea is not your typical Chow Chow girl! At just 2 years old she was found stray by a nice lady who took her in and cared for her. ODAAT became involved to help find her a home and now that she is spayed and healthy again, she is looking for her forever home! Most Chows can be aloof and independent but not Sweet Pea! She LOVES to play and loves children! She has really taken to the 2 yr old in her foster home and gives her kisses all the time. She is very loyal to her family and is good with strangers. Anyone that shows her the slightest amount of kindness, she will shine it back to you every day. She's there to greet you when you come home with a wagging butt and a smile on her face. She is very prey driven so she can not live where there is any type of livestock (cows, chickens, etc.) She does fine with the cats around the house though! She likes her butt scratched right above her tail and loves when you wrap your arms around her and give her hugs. She doesn't like to sleep next to her human or cuddle very much, she likes to be at a distance where she can watch over everyone. When it comes to feeding time she is fed seperately from the other dogs in the home. She does not need crated and is doing great at house training, with just an occasional accident here and there. Her leash skills are developing, she will start out pulling on walks but gets better and is heeling well by the end of the walk. We feel a family best suitable for Sweet Pea is one with breed experience. She will require grooming and daily exercise. If you are interested in adopting Miss Sweet Pea, please apply through our website\nwww.onedogatatime.us",

            "description": "This handsome boy is Oslo. Not only is he the cutest doggie you've seen, he has a personality to match. He's 2 years old, 43 pounds, and tons of fun. He has lots and lots of energy, loves to play, and can't help but express his happiness.Oslo came to the shelter with a broken leg. It has been repaired and he is now on crate rest while it heals. Even though this has been difficult, he has a good attitude and takes it all in stride. He's always happy to see his humans and always greets them with kisses. He is the sweetest boy you'll ever meet. He is crate trained, potty trained, and will walk on a leash, but pulls pretty hard and will be more trained once he's off crate rest. Oslo has not been tested around kids or cats. He does have some food and toy possessiveness, but with his foster dogs he's learning to share and know that no one is going to take his food. Oslo would do best in a home where he can get lots of exercise and receive loads of attention. He loves to lay across laps, cuddle, and give kisses by the dozen. This pet is available for pre-adoption and may not be officially ready for adoption, as it is still undergoing medical treatment. Depending on the medical status, a Meet and Greet may be put on hold until they can safely participate in a meeting with potential adopters. In some cases, this pet may be able to move to its forever home while it is still under the medical care of Dallas Pets Alive. If you are interested in learning more, apply now and one of our Adoption Counselors will discuss the options available so you can bring home your new furry family member!

Winter is playful and curious. She loves going for walks and doesn't pull at all. She's very easy going and enjoys adequate couch time. And her head tilt game is strong. So adorable! Winter gets along well with dogs and cats, and should do well with either with proper introductions. Her foster home has three adult dogs and three adult cats, and she's just part of the pack. She prefers to be near her people at all times, so she'll happily follow you from room to room to make sure she's not missing out on anything. If you're looking for the company of a sweet soul, apply to meet Winter!

We're hoping to find her a home with another confident dog who can show her the ropes, as she is a bit timid and can get nervous around new people and new indoor spaces. Liberty loves to lounge on the couch and delicately sniff around the house with curiosity, but she knows not to mess with anything. As sweet and gentle as she is, she is also a young dog who has a lot of energy and loves to play! She is still learning how to walk on a leash well, as she tends to pull. She is scheduled to be spayed in January. If you are interested in rescuing a collie, please complete this short adoption questionnaire. Our standard adoption fee is $350. This fee helps us to cover the expense of providing each dog with a Health Exam, Rabies/DHPP vaccines, Heartworm Test, Heartworm Preventative, Flea & Tick Protection, Microchip, Neuter/Spay, and a Bath. Thank you for your consideration in adopting a collie in need!!! 1/31/21 2:27 PM",

Rhino will need a bit of time to adjust after all the rapid change in his life, but he'll quickly adapt and be his loveable goofy self. Rhino loves toys of any kind, from puzzles to kongs and soft toys - and everything between! When not going to town on his favorite toy, Rhino will be your adventure partner for life on hikes, walks, outings, playtime in the yard or even just drives around the neighborhood. As an eager-to-please and sensitive pup Rhino knows how to adapt to your feelings and understands when it's time to cuddle up and watch some Netflix, making him a truly flexible dog for any home with a backyard and a loving family. Rhino has even shown his willingness to be an even better dog for you - he comes with paid training support from local trainers who know him well to really strengthen your bond. He'd do well in a home without any other dogs to be the star of the show and needs a semi-activate, adult-only family with a backyard to let him zoom freely! Besides the occasional mouthing, Rhino is just wondering when it will be his turn for a happily ever after. Come see this handsome pup today to see if you can be the one to provide it!",

He is perfectly potty trained and sleeps through the night without making a peep. He only hops onto the furniture when invited and understands that food on the counter does not belong to him, even though he could reach it if he tried! Dasher also sits and stays on command and is currently working on his leash training, which is coming along well! Treat-motivated and eager to please, Dasher would love to show you how smart and fun he is. Come meet this handsome guy!",

This guy is a drop-dead handsome four year old who can seem half his age when he's playing in the yard, fetching balls and sticks to his heart's content. He will win your heart with his big puppy eyes and flop-tacular ears - an adorable symptom of his blue lacy heritage. His favorite pastimes are sniffing absolutely everything, snoozing on the couch, and chewing on toys. Give him something worthy to gnaw and he'll be your best friend, which he'll tell you by wiggling on the ground like a goofball. He can also be a bit of a sous chef in the kitchen and cleans floors free of charge. He's not much of a licker, but George absolutely loves to cuddle at the end of the day. George is house-trained, and has had zero accidents inside. He knows 'sit and 'wait, and can be a good student when treats are around. While he is not a picky eater, he is very allergic to chicken, so be sure to comb those ingredient labels. He loves his crate and likes to cool down there after a good workout session in the yard. George would be ideal for someone with a fenced-in yard, as he is a very athletic and energetic pup and can climb your average 4ft chain link fence when a squirrel or a cat taunt him. If you are looking for a classy canine with an active lifestyle, George would make a perfect companion. Get in touch and come meet George today!",

She loves me, all the people at the rescue love me once they realize I'm just a big ol softy.\nI can be scary if you don't know me because I do protect my family. I am unsure about children because they make me nervous. There were kids at my old home but I knocked them down too much.\nI do really well with other dogs and my buddy Spazz is only 20 lbs but we have so much fun together. We sing, wrestle, run around because he chases me. We hide in the tunnels, share toys and make sure no strangers enter our domain.\nI also love my buddy Freckles and even though I barked at him for a long time we get along really well now and lay on the outside bed together.\nI don't crate because of missing my back leg but I do hang out in my kennel off and on through out the day. I am enjoying my big Costco bed in there too. I am potty trained but can't resist the temptation to pee where others have peed before so sometimes I slip up.\nI may only have 3 legs but I'm down to wrestle, cuddle, go on adventures or whatever you've got in mind. Please don't pass me up, I'm very worth your time...",

They gave no information about Nala, but she is great with people. Even though Nala is great with people, she needs to be an only pet in her new home. She is a calm 3 year old girl, and she knows how to sit on command. This 64 pound loving girl will make a great family member for a family looking for a playful, sweet, smart dog to give all their attention to all the time! Meet Nala in run 852, her ID number is 626612. Nala is up-to-date on vaccines, now spayed, and will be microchipped, and heartworm tested upon adoption. Nala can't wait to love her new family!  A volunteer says she is a stunning dog, treat motivated, doesn't pull on a leash, and very gentle.\n\nNala meets Jansen - https://youtu.be/cM5CbnpwQGI\nNala meets Raleigh - https://youtu.be/Au07qsj1BmI\n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information. Shelter hours are: Tues. - Sun. 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. by appointment only until further notice, CLOSED Mondays & Holidays.",

She is approx 2 years old and 45 lbs. Shelby is super friendly with other dogs, sweet with people and kids and is living with cats that she sometimes wants to chase (so probably best no cats).\n\nShelby is so friendly, and is a happy good girl. She has a wonderful temperament, she is kind of meek and mild, lower key although loves to ramp play up with another dog. She loves to play with the other dogs in the foster home (2 male dogs) and she and one particularly could play for hours. Shelby loves to chew on toys, so we are providing her with bully sticks and toys that are suitable for hard chewers.\n\nShelby's foster says she is very quiet (not a barker), loves cuddles, and is good with everyone. She does not have separation anxiety, and is easy going.\n\nShe's very food motivated, and eager to behave - she's very gentle taking treats!\n\nWe are looking for Shelby's best home. A fenced in yard and another dog to play with.\n\nIf you would like to meet Shelby please let us know! Thank you!\n\nredemptionroadrescue.rescuegroups.org/forms\n\nredemptionroad.mn@gmail.com\n\nhttp://redemptionroadrescue.rescuegroups.org\n\nAll dogs age appropriate vetted:\n\nSpayed or Neutered\nRabies vaccine\nDHPP vaccine\n4DX test (@8 months or older)\nMicrochipped\nDewormed\nFlea/tick prevention",

I'd rather lay on the couch than go jogging (and I have no interest in herding anything!).  I'm not much into balls or toys; but I sure do love treats!    When I was surrendered to Herding Haven I was very overweight.  So I'm now on a strict diet.  I like going for walks k; just don't ask me to run.  Well, unless there is a cat to chase!    I am very selective when it comes to my doggy friends so a home without another dog (or only older mellow dogs) would be best for me.   I'm house broken and crate trained, neutered and up-to-date on my vaccinations.  If you are interested in meeting me, please contact kathie@herdinghaven.org",

Moose can be shy around new people and dogs but gets over it pretty quickly. He has not been around children or cats. We think he would do okay with kids. Cats are more questionable. He is potty trained and marking has not been a problem. He doesn't like to get in the kennel but does okay once inside. Like for a lot of us, 2020 wasn't a great year for Moose.

Once you meet her you'll fall in love with her.\nBella is truly a sweetheart. She listens well, she\u2019s awesome with other dogs both male and female. Ok with cats. While she loves to run around and play but she also loves to snuggle on the couch with her people. She sleeps in her kennel but doesn't need it as she is not destructive and is completely house broken.\nBella has an easy going quiet demeanor..she can be a little shy when you first meet her but warms up quickly to a soft voice and a gentle hand. She is really an amazing girl. She would do well with another dog near her size in the household. \nBella weighs about 45 pounds.  She loves to play with her toys and will make you smile with her silly antics  She is great with respectful children.\nYHT requires a secure fence and a home check. We ask that you are home at least part of the day to help her with her new surroundings and routine.\n If you think shes to good to be true please come meet her! \nIf you would like to meet Bella please email dawnlg39@yahoo.com find out for yourself \n\n",

He is housebroken, knows a few skills, such as sit and down and is so treat motivated, he\u2019s eager to learn more. Being a puppy, he would benefit from professional training. He loves long walks and stopping to greet every dog and person we come across, as a stranger is a friend he hasn\u2019t met yet. We are are learning to ignore distractions and continue on a walk. \n\nMax is a playful dog that loves bounding through the snow, but he also enjoys hanging out wherever you are in the house. He\u2019s been a great co-worker, sleeping at my feet while I\u2019m working. Max is great with our kids and would be a wonderful family dog. He\u2019d be happy being the only dog in the house as he would get all the attention, but with how much Max loves other dogs, he\u2019d be thrilled to have another dog to play with every day.\n\n If you are looking for a playful, beautiful boy, Max is your guy!\n\n This dog does shed and is not hypoallergenic.\n\nHOUSEBROKEN?   GOOD WITH DOGS?  Yes  GOOD WITH CATS?unknown\n\nADOPTION FEE: $550\n\nTo adopt the FIRST STEP is to complete an APPLICATION. The application can be found on our site www.fluffydog.net, or by clicking on the purple Fluffy Dog Rescue wording found in the left corner of this page under the dogs name.\n\nOur dogs are located in foster homes throughout the state. We do not have a facility. Adopters must be 24 years old.We can not adopt to families with children under the age of six. We also adopt in WI, IL, and parts of MN. Most of our dogs are strays, so the breed is our best guess.\nWI License #270548.\n \nCheck out Fluffy Dog Wellness on our Home Page. Great Solutions to Enhance Your Pet's Health. www.fluffydog.net",

He was found wandering in the South Valley, picked up with his sister, and taken to the Bernalillo County Shelter, which is where he came to NMAF from on December 22nd.  He warms up to people pretty quickly and gets along with other dogs and, as a puppy, likes to play so would do well with another doggy playmate, preferably female.  He is currently about 23 pounds so will end up a medium-sized boy when fully grown.  He was diagnosed with kennel cough on December 26th and has started treatment.  It is not uncommon for dogs coming out of the shelter environment, even with immunization, to get this virus, so if he is fostered or fostered-to-adopt, his family needs to have animals immunized for this virus or have no animals in the home.  Due to his time on the streets, we do not recommend children under 10 as he can be spooked.  He is an affectionate boy and makes friends readily as long as you are slow at first.  He is up-to-date on all shots, neutered, and microchipped.\n\nMore Info:  Contact Kate at kmolsbe@gmail.com.\n\nNMAF dogs cannot be adopted out of the greater Albuquerque / Santa Fe area.\n\nAdoption Clinic Location:  PetSmart - Academy & Wyoming, Saturdays, 10:00 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. - Currently Suspended\n\nPlease visit our website at www.nmaf.org for more information.",

(12/15) WHERE I AM FROM: AL (arrival 12/19) \n\nMY STORY: Nitro is a really cool guy. Very sweet, loves to play with the other pups and does have puppy energy. He will need lots of running exercise during the day to make him the best boy he can be. At this age walks just don't cut it and it isn't good for their development mentally and physically to not have them run full out at least three times a day.\n\nDogs are held for two weeks after arrival date. You are welcome to apply, but applications will be processed closer to the available date.\n\nThis dog does shed and is not hypoallergenic.\n\nHOUSEBROKEN?   GOOD WITH DOGS?  Yes  GOOD WITH CATS?unknown\n\nADOPTION FEE: $550\n\nTo adopt the FIRST STEP is to complete an APPLICATION. The application can be found on our site www.fluffydog.net, or by clicking on the purple Fluffy Dog Rescue wording found in the left corner of this page under the dogs name.\n\nOur dogs are located in foster homes throughout the state. We do not have a facility. Adopters must be 24 years old.We can not adopt to families with children under the age of six. We also adopt in WI, IL, and parts of MN.

WHERE I AM FROM: AL (arrival 12/19) \n\nMY STORY:  1/12/2021  What a difference a week makes.  Copper is gaining confidence and is such a sweet and very chill girl.  She is even conquering her fear of hard wood floors.  She\u2019s not 100% certain of them yet, but at least now if we are in a different room she will walk on the wood floors to join us.  We have heard her bark twice and not sure why.  We have open land behind us where there are lots of deer so perhaps that is what she heard.  Other than that, Copper has been a very quiet dog.  She goes to bed easily and doesn\u2019t make a peep until we wake up around 7:30.  We don\u2019t have her in a crate.  We just gate off an area in our laundry room when it\u2019s bed time and she does just fine.  \n\n  She understands the word \u201cno\u201d and responds to my husband whistling.  She takes treats and bones very gently out of my hand and then goes to her blanket in the living room to enjoy them.  Now that her playful side is showing, she has taken a couple of socks and a shoe.  As soon as you say \u201cno\u201d she drops the items.  Copper doesn\u2019t chew them \u2013 just prances around with them in her mouth.  She doesn\u2019t jump up on people and doesn\u2019t go up on furniture.  She is really easy to have around. \n\n  Now that we have established a routine, when Copper has to go out, she goes to the door.  If we think she has to go out and she doesn\u2019t agree, when we open the door Copper will just sit down.   We trust that she knows best. \n\n  Copper loves exploring in our back yard and following deer tracks.  She also has a super good nose.  Twice she has buried her head in the snow and come up with bones left outside.  My husband and I have just retired and if we weren\u2019t planning on travelling a lot, we would gladly welcome Copper into our home permanently.  Our mission is to help Copper and other dogs find homes where they will experience nothing but the good life!  For Copper that is a family with or without kids, with or without another dog but certainly people who are active and will take her on lots of walks and adventures.   She loves to be with her people.\n\nJan. 7th:  Copper is starting to become familiar with what the good life is all about, and she certainly deserves it.  While I am not familiar with her background, the fact that she is very thin, has skin issues and is a bit tentative in her behavior leads to me believe she\u2019s seen some tough times.  During her first couple of days with us, we left Copper alone and let her initiate interaction.  When she did, we gave her tons of love and attention.  Fast forward a few days and it is great to see her come out of her shell and exhibit happy dog behavior.  She is chewing bones and tossing toys.  When she wakes up in the morning she gets into her playful pounce position.  Copper is leery of her leash but with the help of a couple of treats we are able to hook her up to it.  She enjoys going on walks, romping in the snow and meeting people.  We took her to the dog park and she had a ball.  She didn\u2019t venture too far from us and played with several dogs and man is she fast!  Her tail is wagging more and more every day.  She is not crazy about walking on our wooden floors so we have lots of area rugs throughout the house.  It is also going to take some work to get her comfortable riding in a car.  As far as house training goes, we take her out often and notice that she now looks to the door to indicate she has to go out.  It is a subtle sign so we need to pay attention to her cues.  Stay tuned for more details on how she is acclimating to the good life.\n\n \nThis dog does shed and is not hypoallergenic.\n\nHOUSEBROKEN? Yes  GOOD WITH DOGS?

The hoomans here say I am a sweet, spunky, goofy girl!!  I've had a pretty rough life before finding my way to this warm shelter. I've got some pretty gnarly scars that show what I have been through.. but the hoomans say the scars make me even more pretty than I already am.  The people here really make me feel loved, which is not something I have ever really been used to... but I would really like to have my very own hooman friend to share all my love with.  I have a lot of love for the right person,  I just need a little patience in the beginning for me to learn how to trust a hooman again.  The people here think my scars show one of the reasons I'm a little scared of other dogs.. I don't show any aggression towards other dogs, but I'm also a little scared to play with them.. maybe one day I can trust dogs to be nice to me again too and have a great playmate!!  I hope that someone reading this can give me a chance to be the greatest dog I can be for them.\nXOXO, \nSnazzy Jazzy",

While we can\u2019t be sure of his DNA, we know this boy is an all American mix!\n\nHe is about 3 years old and quite the leg leaner, independent but loves to be near his people. Vito is an energetic boy who is into playing outside and exploring. Throw him a ball and he\u2019ll be your best friend.\n\nHe likes to hunt around for chippies which is why we don\u2019t know if he should live with cats.\n\nVito LOVES to play in our fenced yard with a tennis ball, jolly ball, squeaky ball, rope, he\u2019s not picky. He does great at \u201ctrade\u201d and is learning basic obedience. He loves his people and will take as many head/ear scratches as he can get. He is crate trained, house trained and pretty good on the leash too!\n\nVito is happy to take walks with other dogs and is polite in public. When it comes to play, Vito is a rough and tumble dog and his enthusiasm is too much for children and can also be a bit much for other dogs.\n\nVito would be quite happy being an only dog, but we can\u2019t rule out him enjoying a playmate that shares his same WWE philosophy. Based on his breed and personality, we think a female playmate may work out better than male. This boy is a love, looking for the right match to snuggle with and be his forever home.\n\nCall Now: 518-435-7425",

We don\u2019t know his age but he appears to be about 10.  \n\nDuds, as we call him, is a low rider, mellow and easy-going.  He spends a lot of time snoozing between meals.  The clink of kibble in the bowl brings him slowly to the kitchen twice a day.  He is very grateful and loves to curl up in a soft place when he isn\u2019t lying outside in the sun.\n\nDudley ignores dogs and cats.  He moves very slowly due to an old injury to his front right leg.  The leg twists a bit making the foot knuckle over, which makes it difficult for him to walk.  He cannot go for a walk but he can wander around the backyard, provide companionship and love.  Duds doesn\u2019t kiss but he is very grateful to have a warm home and a full belly.  It\u2019s obvious by his wagging tail.  He takes a daily pain med to keep him comfortable.\n\nDudley loves napping in the sun.  Therefore a fenced yard is necessary to adopt him.  (No underground fences.)",

            "description": "Meet DYNAMO-Adoption Pending\n\nRescued: 9/27/2020\nAge at the time of rescue: 6 weeks\nCurrent weight: 17 pounds\n\nDynamo is currently being fostered in NH. He\u2019s a sweetheart who\u2019s just learning what it\u2019s like to live in a home for the first time in his life. Dynamo is a sensitive little guy who is timid upon first introductions. He would probably be fine with kids that are dog savvy and not too rambunctious. He loves to play with other dogs, but again, he can be timid upon first introductions. \nHe is learning so much, and is eager to please. Dynamo is a smart boy who is very food motivated, so training should be fairly easy. He loves to give kisses and be loved. If you\u2019re patient and loving, and ready for some fun, then Dynamo is your boy!\n\nHard to imagine, but Dynamo and his 3 siblings were stuffed into a small birdcage and left on the side of a busy road on the island of Puerto Rico. Left in the sun, this litter of four would not have lasted long and we are very grateful to the man that couldn't simply walk away. He rescued them and asked for help. They've all since recovered and are now ready to find their forever homes. This is Dynamo, he is a happy-go-lucky lab. He loves all people and dogs regardless of size and would be a wonderful addition to any size family. Dynamo is fully vetted and sterilized.\n\nThank you for considering a dog in need! Please download an application from our website at www.satoheartrescue.org. The adoption fee is $400.00 which can be paid by cash or check.\nWe look forward to working with you.",

I was adopted from Safe Haven a while ago, but my dad had to move to assisted living and I couldn\u2019t come along.  I\u2019m looking for a family that wants to have FUN!  I would really love to run and play and chase a ball and\u2026well you get the idea!\n\nThey tell me I need to work on my walking manners and not jumping\u2026but the world is SO EXCITING, it\u2019s hard to stay calm.  And all those PEOPLE!  I want to meet them all!  But I also want to please you so I would be happy for you to show me how to walk better and I will pick it up in no time.\n\nI\u2019m house trained but I don\u2019t like being left alone outside.  I want to be with my people.  If you let me, I would love to snuggle in close on the couch or in the bed.  I sleep in my crate and get along with my two female foster siblings that are about the same size me.\n\nI enjoy alerting my family when anyone is coming near the home, and I have a very loud bark.  Once you win my heart (think treats!), I will lean in for affection. \n\nIf you are looking for an awesome loyal companion who will steal your heart, keep you active, and let you know when a stranger is near \u2026I just might be the guy for you!\n\n\nOur standard adoption fee is $375 cash or check and $385 credit card ($10 processing fee). .  It includes spay/neuter when age appropriate at our participating vets, age appropriate core vaccinations, fecal testing, deworming, flea and tick preventative,1st vet visit at one of our participating vets, and micro-chipping. \n\n\nWe must have an application, conduct a phone interview, and meet your entire family to approve an adoption. Please email adopt@safehavendogsIL.org for an application or additional details.\n\nPlease note that the breeds and sizes posted in this biography are educated best guesses and are not guaranteed.\n\nPlease consider becoming a foster home while you search for your new best friend. We need foster homes - pounds are overflowing with puppies and adult dogs that are at-risk and need help. We can only rescue as many as we have foster home commitments. Fostering is a rewarding experience for your family.",

I'm laying here dreaming of my forever home Where oh where could it be? \n Oh my goodness! Where are my manners I'm so sorry. I was dreaming of my forever home, and didn't see you come in....\n Let me introduce myself. Hi My name is Alcor, the most handsome dog in town. \n I'm a Southern boy from the great state of TN. I'm guessed to be a pointer mix that is about 3 years old. I weigh about 45lbs....\n I've been having fun times at my foster home ; they treat me like one of their own. But let's face it. I'm looking for a Cinderella ending where I get my forever family..\n Maybe you can read more about me and see if we will match up? Can't hurt right?\n I am hesitant when meeting new people so I need a patient adopter that will let me learn to trust at my own speed....\n When I warm up to you, you will know because I'm turning over for belly rubs or have my head in your lap. \n I do have a foster sister, that I do get along with: she and I are pals. But I like to be in charge. So I can be picky about my furry friends. I tend to do better with females then males. What can I say I like my women......\n My favorite toys are Nylabones and balls of all sorts. I am a chewer, so stuffed animals and soft toys don't last very long when I play with them. I like it when foster Mom throws the ball for me. Maybe you can help me work on playing fetch better though. I don't always like to bring the balls back. HAHA! \n I have some prey drive so perhaps best in a home with no cats......\n I think my best home would be one with people who like to snuggle and sometimes go on adventures like hiking. \n Due to my energy level, I think I'm best in a home with a fenced yard so I can run and play......\nHere's me in action: Click here, \n here, \n here, \n here, \n here, \n here, \nand here Showing off my fun with rope toys\n PERK ALERT \nSaved the best for last \n * house & crate trained\n * love going for walks\n * love entertaining myself with my toys\n * loves to snuggle and give kisses\n I'm really want my forever family so if you think you have the patience and are willing to help me be a better me, how about we do it together? After all working together is always better then doing it alone. So let's hit that apply button and get this family started......\n\nApply today, I wont be available long!\n\n\n\nTo adopt this dog, or any OPH dog, fill out the simple online application at https://ophrescue.org \nOperation Paws for Homes, Inc. (OPH) rescues dogs of all breeds and ages from high-kill shelters in NC, VA, MD, and SC, reducing the numbers being euthanized. With limited resources, the shelters are forced to put down 50-90% of the animals that come in the front door. OPH provides pet adoption services to families located in VA, DC, MD, PA and neighboring states. OPH is a 501(c)(3) organization and is 100% donor funded. OPH does not operate a shelter or have a physical location. We rely on foster families who open their homes to give love and attention to each dog before finding a forever home.",

My name is Barbara and I'm a lovey, hound dog. I'm a calm lady but still have some youthful energy and need a fenced in yard where I can sniff all the things and at least 1 good walk per day. I especially like hikes where my nose can lead the way so I need a family who can keep up! Trips to the dog park are a huge plus too. I like playing with toys, but don't stay interested too long. I'm fully housebroken and know to do all my business outside. I don't bark often, but when I do it's LOUD! Living in an apartment or home with close neighbors would not be good for me.\n\nHow well do I get along with others? Well, I met a few cats at the shelter before coming to PA and they make me a little crazy, but I love meeting other dogs. Sometimes I'm hesitant about meeting new humans but I warm up really quickly. Maybe almost too much! Once I get comfortable, I love getting up close and personal. My skin is still a little itchy but it's been getting better with my special baths. I don't love getting baths, but I know they help so I stand still and let my human do her job. Afterwards I get the zoomies which helps me dry off. Once the sun goes down, I'm a snuggler and like to lounge around. I sleep in my foster's bed at night, dreaming of my forever home!\n\nView Barbara's videos:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/-Pp-DZgmRyI\n\nhttps://youtu.be/e0Yc2VaSpaI\n\nhttps://youtu.be/nAy7rRrqdO4\n\nA few more notes about Barbara... She was picked up as a stray in WV. She was in terrible shape, missing hair due to a fungal infection. With medicated baths and meds, she has grown back most of her hair and is ready to find her forever home.\n\nHer adoption donation includes spaying, vaccinations, implanting of a microchip, application of flea meds and worming.\n\nBarbara is in foster care so please complete an application at our website (\nwww.castawaycritters.org\n) before meeting her. Completing an application does not obligate you to adopt; however, it is required. Applications are processed in the order received in an effort to find the best match possible for both the dog and the adopter.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\n\nBuster is a handsome dark brindle pit lab mix that was born on or around 6/20/2019. Buster is an active boy that needs a home with prior dog experience. Buster loves other dogs when introduced properly. His time spent as a stray and always looking for food has left a lasting behavior of \"not sharing food\" so he will need to be fed separately from other animals. Speaking of other animals, Buster isn't really a cat kind of dog and would do best in home with out them. What he would do best with; a big back yard, toys galore, no apartments, and a family to call his own.\n\nAmazing Grace Bully Rescue is a foster based rescue in the Pensacola, Florida area. We do not have a physical building. If you would like to meet any of our pups, the first step is to fill out our online application so we can contact you.\n\nOur adoption fee for Buster is $200and includes four sets of puppy shots, two dewormings (done prior to adoption) his/her spay/neuter, current shots, rabies vaccine, and a registered microchip.\n\nIf you would like to adopt this Amazing dog, please fill out our online adoption application at www.amazinggracebullyrescue.org\n\nIf you have any questions, please text your question to 723-2037. You may also send a message to our Amazing Grace Bully Rescue Page on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or send an email directly to amazinggracebullyrescue@gmail.com\n\nDisclaimer: We are located in the Pensacola, Florida area and will consider local applicants first, especially with puppies since we use a vet in the local area.",

She is finally out of quarantine and ready for adoption after healing from contagious ringworm. We couldn\u2019t believe we had to put this amazing pup on hold for weeks because of the neglectful home she came from but she is now 100% ready for adoption! She is currently fostering It's A Dog's Life Doggy Daycare & Resort practicing her dog skills and loving all the playtime. We would love to get her in a FOSTER or ADOPTIVE home ASAP!\n\nLina is a 1 year old, 44 pound pocket pittie chunky biscuit looking for an active family she can walk, hike, and even run. She is truly up for anything and just wants to be among all the action! Lina would adore another playful dog friend and so far has loved everyone she\u2019s met. Her excitement can be a lot and she\u2019s still working on some manners so we suggest older kids she won\u2019t easily knock over. A fenced in yard would be optimal for zoomies and playing with new best friends. \n\n** All of our Wigglers are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, hw tested/treated, and on preventatives. We require proof spanning 3 consistent years of HW preventatives for already owned pets, UTD on shots, and spay/neuter in order to adopt. Please read their description above closely. Our adoption fee is $350. For an application to foster or adopt send us your number and email address in a message. **\n",

            "description": "Pretzel is such a good girl! She is the brown brindle dog in the photo. She is a little nervous when meeting new people, but once she trusts you she will be your loyal shadow. She needs to go to a home with another dog that is confident to show her the ropes. She is a sweet and snuggly girl and is doing well with learning basic commands. She is protective of her food and needs to be fed separately from the other dogs in the home. Because of this pretectiveness with food, she also can not go to a home with young children. She is working on sharing her toys with other dogs, and she likes pile them up and hoard them in her area. Pretzel has been playing well with her doggie foster siblings, she likes to wrestle and play chase. She kennels well, with only a small protest at first. Pretzel is heartworm positive and her treatment will be covered by Mountain Pet Rescue Asheville. She is working to put on a little weight and to rebuild the muscle in her rear legs. She would love to have a home for the New Year! If you are interested in her, please apply at mpravl.org.\n\nAll Mountain Pet Rescue (Asheville) animals are up-to-date on vaccinations, spayed/neutered and micro-chipped before adoption. Contact the foster parent or Mountain Pet Rescue at pets@mpravl.org for more information.\n\nPlease note that visual breed identification of companion animals has been proven to be unreliable, so for most of our animals we provide a best guess at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each of our animals as an individual and do our best to describe and place pets based on personality not breed label.\n\nMountain Pet Rescue is a 501(c)(3) non-profit tax deductible charity (EIN 82-3039637) located in Asheville, NC.",

There will be a drop down menu where you must read and meet all of the prerequisites. Next, read the \"Steps To Adoption\", fill out the \"Interest Form\" and submit it online. THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO APPLY. Unfortunately, we are unable to respond to inquires made in any other way.\n\nPoodle Rescue will contact you if we feel this dog, or a similar dog in our program, matches the specifications on your Questionnaire/Interest Form. Please keep in mind Poodles and Poodle Mixes are in high demand therefore the demand for them far outweigh the supply. If you do not hear from us please re-submit your Interest form quarterly as they are not recurring. Unfortunately, we cannot answer email or telephone inquiries about our available dogs.  Please be sure you have a current phone number listed on the questionnaire/Interest Form and the best time we can reach you. Adoption Fees vary.\n\nAll dogs are spayed/neutered, current on shots, parasite / heart worm disease tested (and treated if positive).  All dogs are microchipped, groomed and use a dog door at our facility.\n",

            "description": "This fella came into rescue through no fault of his own. His previous owner realized that her changing work hours were not compatible with Crashs needs. Crash is a 2 year old, 75 lb., un-altered, male Dutch Shepherd mix located in Arkansas who would love to find his forever home.\n\nHis foster home says that Crash is a great dog! He is very high energy. He does well with their bigger dogs and plays with their smaller dogs through a chain link fence. He just gets too excited to play with the littles. He knows some basic obedience and his foster has worked on honing in his skill. He loves to play any dog games. He's been introduced to rally, but he prefers to chase, hunt (low prey drive), fetch, or anything with a ball. He is doing very well inside. He is crate trained but, if he can hear or see people, he barks. He just wants to be with his people. He has not shown any bit of aggression. He is a very loving and playful boy. He needs to be worked and worn out several times a day. He definitely isnt one to just lay around all day. Once he is bored he will bark, bark, bark! An experienced handler or someone interested in dogs sports would be great for Crash.\n\nCrash is currently undergoing treatment for internal parasties. Once complete and he gets a clean bill of health, he will be neutered before heading off to his new home. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting this pet please complete an application at this link https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/24689/generic . \n\nWe are an official 501C3 organziation that does not have a physical location.

BB is one of those super happy dogs, who has no clue that he's sick. He was picked up as a stray and no one came. He found the shelter to be confining and very scary, so he retaliated by destroying his water bucket, day after day. Hence, Bucket Buddy. Our SCRAPS friends determined he needed rescue, with all his lumps and bumps and asked if we could be so kind as to help BB. BB has cancerous mast cell tumors, which we removed 5 of them! While Bucket Buddy may get the mast cells again, the great news is they were low grade and not terminal. Buddy had years of fun in front of him.\n\nBB is a youthful goofball who bounces around his foster mom's house like a kid at Christmas morning - every morning. He would do best having your heart and all your attention, and we are asking that folks are prepared for him to be an only dog with no other pets in the home. If you have in your heart a special spot for a special dog like Bucket Buddy, please consider dropping us an application: https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/12564/generic",

Kong is learning to walk well on a lead and he is working on basic manners and obedience training. He is a quick, eager learner and knows \"sit,\" and \"wait\" and is highly treat motivated.\nKong is a Hound/Shepherd mix. His DOB is 12/10/2019 and he weighs 68 pounds. He is neutered, microchipped, current on all vaccinations, and takes preventative flea/tick/heartworm medicine.\nAs with all our dogs, Kong must be an indoor dog.\nIf you are interested in adopting Kong, please email bahshelter@yahoo.com. If there are other dogs in your home, we require a meet and greet, which you can schedule via email at bahshelter@yahoo.com.\nIf you cannot attend your scheduled visit, kindly text or call the volunteer you are meeting with before your scheduled visit. They are taking time out of their day to meet with you. Thank you!",

            "description": "Phoenix (FiFi) is a large senior female Treeing Walker Hound about 11 years old.  She has been passed around to several different people and no one could keep her long term.  She is very good in the house and is completely house trained. She is OK with cats but was aggressive towards kittens when she iwas young.  She can be possessive of her surroundings and does not like other dogs in her inside space.  She is fine when she meets other dogs on walks or outside.  She does have some food aggression so would need to be fed separately. She has separation anxiety when left alone inside too long and can be destructive to doors and windows.  She will knock over garbage cans outside when left alone.  She does like to be outside as long as someone is with her.  She likes being groomed with a grooming glove but does not like brushes. She loves belly rubs and snuggling. Her current caregiver says when she came to them she was very overweight and had mobility issues.  They have been taking her out for walks frequently and she has lost some weight and seems to be getting around better.  She needs somewhere that she can just relax and be sure of a permanent home for however long she has left to enjoy life.\n\nPhoenix is looking for a forever family to call her own. Her adoption fee is $200, which includes spay surgery and vaccinations (parvo/distemper and rabies.) If you would like to meet this dog, please email us: scfourpaws@hotmail.com or leave a message @ 435-764-3534. Please be patient with us getting back to you as we are all volunteers with full-time jobs. Thanks for your interest in this wonderful dog!!",

The adoption application is found on our website: www.greenmorerescue.org. You can also cut and paste the following internet address which will take you directly to the Greenmore Application page: \nhttp://www.greenmorerescue.org/online-form-dog.html\n\nNAME: Cooper\nBREED:  beagle Mix\nAGE:  10 years old\nGENDER: Female \nWEIGHT: 40 lbs.\nTemperament/ Energy level: Friendly; medium energy\nRecommendation for kids: good\nRelationship with dogs: good\nRelationship with cats: not yet tested\nNeutered / Spayed: Yes \nCrate-trained: Yes \n\nCopper is a sweet senior beagle with some special circumstances. She arrived here at the farm ready to go to her forever home, but we discovered she has a lump in her throat and was pulled off our available adoptables until we could figure out her medical needs. A biopsy was attempted, but unable to determine if her slow growing tumor is cancerous.. She does not have any tumors on her lungs and has still remained the sweetest girl through all this! We are looking for permanent placement for Copper. Her adoption fee is waived for anyone willing to take this lovely lady home to be another member of their pack. We would also place her in a permanent foster home. She loves people, gets along with other dogs/cats, is easy to walk, and is very food motivated.  She loves to roam around the yard and is such as easy girl to have around!  We don't know exactly how old Copper is (although we estimate around 10 years old) and we don't know if she has cancer, but we do know she has a lot of love to give and would be so so grateful to go home with a family to give her some comfort and love. \n\n*For more information about our adoption process and an adoption application, please visit greenmorerescue.org.  \n\n***A NOTE ON BREEDS: All of our dogs' listed breeds are our best estimations and not guaranteed.",

The problem is when new people come over he becomes protective and occasionally has unpredictability snapped. We managed it when it was just my husband and I as we would put him up when friends came over but now with 2 young babies I just can't do it anymore-I'm always worried about where the dog is in relation to the child. I love this dog and have worked through a lot with him over the years and trying to manage the anxiety but he just can't be trusted with strangers/new faces inside the house. He would do really well at a house without kids and someone who lives alone/couple who doesn't have a ton of action/people coming in and out.\n\nAge: 9 years\nWeight: 50 lbs\nVetting: neutered , up to date on vaccines, heartworm negative\nTemperament: Good with adults of his own family. No small kids, no stranger traffic.\nTraining: crate trained, house trained, knows commands\n\nEmail for questions: taylorbryant813@gmail.com\n\nTo ensure we're meeting both pet and adopters' needs, we ask potential adopters to complete an Adoption Application ( www.bit.ly/DH-Adoption ) for caretakers to review. Once approved, we will bring the adoptable pet to your home for a preliminary visit. We are 100% donation funded; unless otherwise noted above, please expect a minimal adoption fee of $250 to cover each pet's basic vetting.\n\nOnce your application is approved, we will bring the adoptable pet to your home for a preliminary visit.

This self-starting, confident labby mix had THE best time carrying balls around in her mouth in our play area and when that game wore off, it was time to roll over and sunbathe, find a human to hug and or kiss and then repeat, repeat!  Jenna loves attention and being the center of attention.  She was front and center in her kennel ....ready to go and do...and this same energy/desire to be part of the action, perfectly followed her out to our front field area.  Jenna is a rough and tumbly kind of gal and while she enjoys the company of other dogs,  some dogs might be put off a bit by her up front approach of \"let's be immediate best friends and play hard style.\"  With love and enthusiasm to share,  Jenna would thrive in a home where she can be in the thick of things and be a part of the daily action.  You can count on Jenna  brightening your day, each and every day.  Ps.  She has the MOST stunning dark chocolate coat!",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.My name is Jefe and I am a super cuddly one year old boy that loves everyone! I can be slightly reserved when meeting new dogs, but once I have a chance to sniff things out I'm super playful and energetic! When it comes to meeting new people, there's no hesitation at all and I'm always excited to play! I love getting my belly scratched and playing tug-of-war, but I'm also happy to relax and chew on my favorite toy for hours on end. You might even find me hanging out in my crate for a mid-day nap if we aren't running circles outside or playing in the house! I really love my crate and have no problem spending the night there, as long as I have a few toys to keep me occupied. I've got all the basic commands down and I'm a great listener, but I can zone out and get distracted pretty easily. That's why it's recommended that I go to a home with someone willing to work with me on recall and name recognition, preferably with treats! But otherwise I can sit, stay, lay down, and will even wait for you to tell me it's ok to eat my food! I love going on walks and am great on the leash, even with another dog tied to me! I am also housebroken. Because of my size, about 75lbs, it's recommended that I go to a home without small children around, since I have some trouble with personal space. Sometimes when I greet people, I like to nibble on their fingers before I sniff them, but with the right training I'm sure I can move past that and learn how to properly ask for pets! If you think you can offer me my furever home, please contact your adoption coordinator. If you do not have an adoption coordinator, please complete an adoption application at https://freedomgermanshepherdrescue.org. I am being fostered near Raleigh.",

            "description": "Andy! Smart and playful! \nHi my name is Andy! I am a 60lbs, 5 year old mixed breed boy. I am very friendly with dogs and humans alike. I am very food oriented and will do anything for a treat! I have medium energy level and I know how to entertain my self in my crate when my human is busy. I am also super clean in my crate! I love walks and Im still working on my leash etiquette. My favorite thing is to play and wrestle with my friends! I am good with female and male dogs alike! I go to doggie day care and my best friend is a German Shepherd that is not neutered, since I am not an alpha I play with him really well and I dont mind him being the boss. I also play really well with female dogs. I am very interested in cats .. so it might be a good idea that I dont go to a home with cats. I would do anything for a treat so training me is rater easy. \nWe love inquiries and questions through Petfinder but we receive so many is impossible for us to answer, the best way to contact us is visiting our website. There you can find an explanation of the adoption process/ fees /requirements and you can follow a link to fill an adoption application. Thanks!  Www.RociosRescues.org\nThanks for wanting to make a rescue dog a part of your family!!",

Ebony can startle easily, she would do best in a home with no kids. \nEnergy Level: Moderate\nNeeds a fenced in yard? YES\nAdoption Fee: $\nAny other info:\n\nMeet Ebony!\nThis girl is so very special to us and we are really hoping to find her home locally. ** bonus if you're a client ** Would really like to keep Serenity as her vet for life.\n\nEbony came to us as a new mom but unfortunately all of her babies except one passed away. Ebony was such a good mom to them but nothing she did could help them and that was hard on our sweet girl.\n\nEbony can be shy with strangers but is an extremely loving and affectionate girl. She is very loyal to her people and truly exemplifies man's best friend.\nEbony is very intelligent and does amazing with training. She already knows how to sit, wait, and give her paw. She would love a family that would continue training with her and exercise both her mind and body regularly.\n\nAs you can see, Ebony is stunning! She loves to wear cute sweaters and is eager to please her people. She can be selective with other animals so a meet and greet is required.\n\nEbony loves to cuddle and be right up against her people. Whoever adopts Ebony will be very lucky to have her unconditional love for the rest of her days.\nEbony is a Rottweiler mix with the cutest spots and puppy dog eyes. She is surely going to win over your heart when you meet her. \n\n\nOur adoption fees include the pets spay or neuter, microchip, up to date vaccines, heartworm/tick disease testing and fecal check.  All adoption fees can be found on our groups' Petfinder page. \nThe first step to our adoption process is to please fill out and adoptions application, it can be found on our website www.serenityanimalhospital.net, under the \"Adopt From Us\" Tab.\nPlease email the application to adoptions@serenityanimalhospital.net or drop it off in person during our business hours. Any questions regarding our adoptable dogs can be emailed along with your application.  Please allow us a few days to contact you about your application as we do get many in on a daily basis.  We will contact you as soon as possible. \n",

Mocha was overwhelmed at the shelter so we moved her to a foster home so she could relax. Her foster says she is very sweet and affectionate. She is fully housebroken and fine to be in a crate when left alone. We recommend an adult-only home with no other pets for Mocha. She loves to be with her people so someone who is not gone long hours would be best. She has a medium level of energy. She has the most soulful hazel eyes and will make someone a wonderful companion. If you would like to meet Mocha, email dogs@daws.org to arrange.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\nGordo is a rat terrier / chihuahua mix who was born in March 2008 and weighs\n17 lbs. He is a happy, gentle and loving boy.\n\nLike his sister Sky, Gordo is as peppy and agile as a young dog. He loves to go on walks in nice weather and does well in a harness, on a twin leash with his sister. He does fine with a 30 minute walk, sniffing along the way every so often, but not so much that you can't get in a nice brisk walk without stopping all the time.\n\nSince the first night in our home, Gordo has slept in the bed, under the covers. He would not be happy if he couldn't sleep with his human. He is a great sleeper, no moving or kicking or snoring. He is a great heating pad in the winter!\n\nGordo is a gentle boy, looking into your eyes with love, and then bowing his head when you pet him. Unlike his sister, he's not a fan of being picked up, but he will come cuddle with you on the couch or bed and let you pet him as long as you want. He likes to sleep in a dog bed right next to his human while she works from home. If she is out of sight for too long, he notices and goes to seek her out, sometimes scratching at the bathroom door.\n\nGordo is mostly housetrained and does best when he can have multiple let outs during the day. His foster human has come to learn the signs of when he wishes to go outside (standing at the baby gate to the kitchen, in the case of our setup). He is great about going outside, getting down to business, and coming back in. He rarely barks, but the one time he does is to get back inside, so we have learned to wait at the door for him.\n\nGordo gets along fine with the cats in the house, sometimes chasing & barking at them when they get wily. He lives peacefully with our resident terrier and they don't interact much, but are fine sleeping in dog beds next to each other, or in the same bed, on either side of their human. Unlike his sister, Gordo has no problem sharing the love and attention that you shower upon him. He is truly a happy-go-lucky pup.\nInterested in adopting this lovable animal? Please go to our website www.wagsmn.org and fill out an Adoption Application. Once the application is processed, a Wags representative will contact you, answer any questions you may have, and set up a time/location for a meet and greet! A home visit is required prior to adoption.\n\nThank you for choosing to adopt!\n\nBreed and temperament determination: Wags & Whiskers Animal Rescue attempts to determine breed and temperament using a combination of looks, information provided to us at intake, and our experience with the animal while in our Rescue. We do not guarantee this determination.",

Once animals are posted, we immediately begin receiving applications. With one volunteer available to review all applications, we appreciate your patience as you wait for an email response. Adoption appointments are scheduled in the order that approved applications are received. You can find our adoption procedures and online application at warmhearts.org/adopt.\n\nRegis transferred in to use from another shelter when he was found injured. (We do not have any background information from before he came to us.) After several months of TLC from our clinic staff, Regis is ready to find his forever home. He will need a home with a fenced in yard for him to get plenty of exercise safely. He is a friendly boy once he learns that he can trust a person.Regis's estimated DOB is 8/1/2017; he weighs approximately 53 pounds and is done growing in size. We cannot be sure if Regis is house trained.\n\nHSPC's adoption fee is seventy-five-dollars through December 31, 2020, unless stated otherwise within the pet's description. At times, our adoption fees are lowered during special events that are posted to our website or Facebook page. Every pet that is available for adoption has been spayed/neutered, microchipped, and is up-to-date on vaccinations including heartworm preventative (canines). Adopters are required to schedule a wellness exam with their veterinarian at their cost within 7 days of adoption.\n\nPlease only submit one application. Once you are contacted by email, you will have an opportunity to provide us with any additional animal(s) under consideration.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\nSky is a rat terrier / chihuahua mix who was born in March 2008 and weighs\n\n10\n\nlbs. She is a bit sassy and a lot loveable.\n\nShe is not super interested in toys, but she has shown interest in small bones. Unlike her brother Gordo, Sky prefers to sleep alone, buried under fluffy blankets, or in front of an air vent. In the morning however, if she is up before you, you will feel little paws walking on your body and then she will gently paw at you to pet her. She will give you kisses and rub her head against you.\n\nSky loves both of her foster humans but has really taken to the man in the family. She has a bit of a jealous streak and doesn't like when other pets or humans come near when she is soaking up the love in someone else's arms. She also does not like being disturbed when she is sleeping. Those are the only situations where her sass comes out. For this reason, Sky can not be adopted to a home where there are small children, or anyone who will not respect her boundaries. Sky likes to be picked up and held as long as she is not being startled out of sleep. It is easy to get to know her boundaries.\n\nSky get be a bit barky at times, mostly out of excitement. While her food is being prepared, or leading up to a walk, or when a visitor comes over. She would be best in a home with no shared walls.\n\nSky is mostly housetrained but she does have some marking behavior\nand sometimes has accidents if it takes too long to get her outside\n. The accidents became less frequent as she got used to being in our house, and with new routines. She does very well when she can be let out several times a day, and especially after her naps. Sky does use the pee pads near the door during the night if she wakes up and \"needs to go\".\n\nSky and her brother currently live with two adults, multiple cats, and one very chill terrier. They occasionally chase the cats or bark at them (mostly near meal time when everyone is competition mode) but they don't mean any harm. Sky gets along just fine with the resident terrier. They mostly just either sniff, or ignore, each other.\n\nDespite being a senior, Sky is full of pep and is as agile as a young dog. She can jump up on the couch and bed, and can go on half hour walks in nice weather with no problem. Sky may have a few quirks and challenges, but she more than compensates by being a cuddly and loving pup who is devoted to her humans.\nInterested in adopting this lovable animal? Please go to our website www.wagsmn.org and fill out an Adoption Application. Once the application is processed, a Wags representative will contact you, answer any questions you may have, and set up a time/location for a meet and greet! A home visit is required prior to adoption.\n\nThank you for choosing to adopt!\n\nBreed and temperament determination: Wags & Whiskers Animal Rescue attempts to determine breed and temperament using a combination of looks, information provided to us at intake, and our experience with the animal while in our Rescue. We do not guarantee this determination.",

            "description": "Lady is about 2 years old (born 9/2/2018) and is a small (10 pounds) rough coat Jack Russell Terrier mix girl.  When we got her she was not well.  Thin, wormy, itchy, shy.  She is doing much better in her foster home.  She likes to play and is very affectionate.  She\u2019s been spayed and vaccinated.  Her foster mom says she is still working on house training.  She is afraid of loud noises and you cannot raise your voice to her...she runs and hides. When she first arrived in her foster home, she would run from you if you tried to pick her up...she had to come to you, but that\u2019s getting  better with time.  She isn\u2019t going to be a dog that will stay in a crate or kennel while somebody works all day.  She doesn\u2019t want to be in one at night either.  She barks and howls when in a crate.  And she likes to sleep near her person at night.  Her personality is showing more, following her foster mom around, wanting on her lap.  She plays with other dogs, and is learning how to play with toys.  She barks when looking out the window or when outside.  Her foster mom is trying to break her of chewing on her back feet and toenails.  She did have a Cytopoint shot.  Lady MUST HAVE a securely fenced yard.  Jack Russells are notorious for being escape artists!  NO chain link as she can climb right up it.  NO electronic fencing as she runs through it.  Please DO NOT apply if you do not meet the fence requirements; your application will NOT be considered.  We also want her to have an owner that is home most of the day.  Other small dogs are okay but she requires a home with no cats and no kids.  Kids make her very nervous and she runs and hides.  She will do best with another small dog to play with that isn\u2019t aggressive or an alpha.  Big dogs make her nervous so we want to avoid a home with big dogs.  A home visit and a good vet reference are mandatory to adopt Lady.  Her adoption fee is $275.  Her adopter must be able to drive to the Hampton, Iowa area to get her.  Please fill out the adoption application at www.russellresue.com if you are interested in making Lady a part of your forever home!  Contact: jamesejolley@gmail.com\n\n",

            "description": "Harvey is a 3-year-old male Black Lab mix who must be neutered before he is adopted. He came to PAHS as a stray and was never reclaimed by his owner. Harvey is a very nice looking adult dog. His coat is shiny black and he has white markings. Harvey currently weighs 64 pounds so he is a very big guy. He is extremely active and would need an experienced owner who would spend a lot of time with him trying to curb his energy level. Harvey would also need a securely fenced yard where he could exercise and play. He would be good with other dogs but due to his size and energy we would recommend he NOT be adopted to a home with small or young children. Harvey will need a patient owner who will work with him to help him reach his full potential. Harvey is a great dog and we hope he can find the perfect home soon.Dog/puppy adoption fees are $120 and cat/kitten adoption fees are $50. Our adoption fees cover a microchip, microchip registration, discounted spay/neuter certificate, deworming, vaccinations (as age and law requires), and a courtesy vet exam at participating offices. Unless otherwise indicated under 'special needs' our dogs have screened heart worm negative.",

Holly is only around 40lbs.   She is a doll. Super sweet. She would prefer a home with other dogs. She gets along with all dogs of all sizes that she has met. She also does well with cats.  She has a little separation anxiety and would like someone to be home with her more than not.  Holly has done well with children in a temp foster home. She can be a bit nervous when first settling in.  Her foster loves her and thinks she is going to make someone a great companion. \n Holly is spayed and up to date on her shots.  $150\n   Higginsville Mo.",

She requires a home with no other dogs, no kids and no cats.  You must have a securely fenced yard and be home most of the day.  Hollie wants to be close to you all the time.  She loves to be held and cuddled!  She doesn\u2019t like being alone, not even outside.  She wants to be with her person.  Hollie wants a quiet, calm home environment.  But she is also active and energetic and needs an owner who will take her for a walk or run and/or let her play outside in her yard daily.  Hollie likes to sleep with her person in their bed at night, but her foster mom is working on training her to sleep in her crate at night.  She is potty trained and asks to go out by scratching or barking at the door.  Hollie loves to go for car rides and is a pretty good little passenger!  She loves meeting new people and has a fun personality.  She mostly likes all people, but is picky about her doggie friends, which is why she would do best in a home where she is the only dog.  Her adoption fee is $275.  Her adopter must be able to travel to the Tulsa, Oklahoma area to get her.  Please fill out the online adoption application at www.russellrescue.com Contact: jamesejolley@gmail.com\n\n\n\n",

            "description": "Animal Profile:\nCameron is an estimated 1 year old 60 lb male Lab Catahoula mix. We took him in last minute when his rescue fell through and we're so glad we did. He's just a puppy (we were told he was older). He has loose body language, super friendly to all people and other dogs. He's such a sweet affectionate boy. Cameron is looking for a home with a fenced yard, no cats and no kids under 12.\n\nFoster Update:\n\nHe's a very sweet happy dog that just wants to snuggle and sit in you lap. He doesn't seems to have any training so we're currently working on leash manners, the name game and sit. He's doing well with crate training and seems to be potty trained. He does well with other dogs and is a polite player. He seems to be a little reactive on leash to dogs that are being reactive towards him, but if the other dogs ignores him he does the same. I think he would like another dog friend in his forever home but think he would be fine without one. He seems to resource guard with other dogs and food so we will work on \"out\" as well. His energy level is very medium.\n\nAdoption Info: Adoption fee is $500, which includes spay/neuter, current rabies/DAPPV/bordetella vaccinations, microchip, health certificate, heartworm test. All adoption fees are donations to a Washington non-profit corporation and all donations go to benefit the animals in our rescue.\n\nApply online at www.DogGoneSeattle.org\n\nAnimal History: This dog was transferred from our Texas rescue partner. This dog will be available for adoption in Seattle once evaluated.",

            "description": "Chase arrived at his Minnesota foster home a few weeks ago and he is ready to find his forever home. He is wonderful with kids and with other dogs. He is incredibly handsome and smart! He learned how to hug very quickly and he is full of love and kisses for everyone he meets!!Chase's ideal home will have another dog and children as he loves both! He will need some help feeling secure when crated while his family is not home, his foster family will continue to work on that. FROM HIS FOSTER MOM:\nYou will fall in love with this beautiful boy the moment you meet him! When first meeting people, he can be a little \"springy\" but then settles down right away. It's just his way of meeting people when he gets excited. We are working on those manners though. He is treat driven and eager to please which makes for easy obedience training. For being a young dog, he is very lazy. Give him a bone and a soft bed, he will be a happy camper! He is not allowed on the furniture here for training purposes but we can tell if we let him, he would snuggle up in your lap on the sofa instantly. He is great with our kids. We have not once witnessed any type of aggression from him. The kids are all over him, and he just so tenderly lets them! He definitely is more of a submissive personality, rolls over belly up right away. We haven't had him play with other dogs but can tell how he likes to play with us that he really would do great with another dog. He has good leash manners on a walk, and did very well when walking by other dogs. He has only barked once the whole time he has been here and it was just a woof. Chase does have some separation issues when we leave while he is in his crate. I think with some training and trust building he will be able to get through it. He loves his crate and will go in there voluntarily otherwise. He would do great with an owner that worked from home for the long run or is home much of the day. Overall, Chase is such a sweet boy, he loves people and would be a great addition to any family!",

I am good with other dogs and after our walk or play time, I love to curl up on your lap for a good snuggle. I don't love being picked up so don't worry about doing that and hurting your back.\n\nI am tidy in my bunk room and will make a great addition to a 'mature - wink wink' Florida home.",

She was in an apartment with no fenced area for him to play.  Zippy does enjoy a fenced in yard when he wants to spend time outside.  When Zippy isn't enjoying his outside space \"guarding\" his home, he enjoys laying on the sofa and if his human is on the couch he is even more thrilled and will sit on your lap!\n\nZippy will visit the vet soon to have his teeth cleaned before adoption.\n\nZippy is neutered, current on vaccines, and microchipped.  \n\nIf you are interested in adopted Zippy please go to www.pawsitivelypugs.org and fill out an adoption application.\n\nNOTE:  Sending in an inquiry through PetFinder IS NOT applying to adopt the dog.

He will need an adult-only home that can give him plenty of exercise and playtime. Koby gets along well with other dogs and would do best in a home with other playful dogs. He has not had the opportunity to be introduced to a cat.  \n\nKoby excels with slow and steady introductions to new people. He will need a home that can give him the time, patience, and training to allow him to become relaxed in new situations.  Koby came to DSR as an owner surrender and has had professional dog training. It is highly recommended that an adopter continue his training with a certified dog trainer. \n\nKoby is a very handsome dog that needs an experienced owner who will continue to invest in his transformation into an amazing companion.  \n\nThe fee for adoption is $450. This includes spay/neuter, vaccinations and transport fees.\n\nInterested in adopting Koby?

He gets so excited to meet new people, he sometimes cannot control himself, needing some training to correct puppy tendencies, such as jumping and mouthiness. Because of this, he needs to go to a home without children as he can be too much for them. Adults only or teenagers who are experienced with dogs please. He would love a doggie sibling, but it must be one who is already settled and trained, who can be a good role model for him. No cats for Max, please.\n\nMax does great in a car, is house trained, and crate trained. He is still working on leash training because he is always in such a rush to get anywhere when going on walks! Max Murphy is available for adoption thru Eleventh Hour Rescue.\n\nApply to adopt MAX MURPHY LONESTAR at www.EHRdogs.org!",

The standard minimum donation for puppies is $325 + 8.25% tax = $351.81, for dogs over 12 months the adoption fee is $225 + 8.25% tax = $243.66 and for our senior dogs 8 years and up is $100 + 8.25% tax = $108.25; this increase includes sales tax recently required by the State of Texas to collect. You can view all the adoptable pets and fill out an adoption application online on our website at http://dallasdogrrr.org. \n\nFor more information, you can email adopt@dallasdogrrr.org.

The standard minimum donation for puppies is $325 + 8.25% tax = $351.81, for dogs over 12 months the adoption fee is $225 + 8.25% tax = $243.66 and for our senior dogs 8 years and up is $100 + 8.25% tax = $108.25; this increase includes sales tax recently required by the State of Texas to collect. You can view all the adoptable pets and fill out an adoption application online on our website at http://dallasdogrrr.org. \n\nFor more information, you can email adopt@dallasdogrrr.org.

Uh, make that \u201cour\u201d house, OK?  I definitely need a house with a yard cuz I need room to run and romp and be safe!  \n\nI am a CHIWEENIE mix.  I am 5 years old and I weigh 12 pounds.  I have had all of my shots and have been spayed so I'm ready to go to my new home with YOU!!  Those funny-looking 2-legged creatures said I\u2019m also microchipped \u2013 whatever THAT is.  At any rate, I will be fully vetted.  Is that anything close to petted?  I love to be petted!  \n\nWanna hear some more good stuff about me?  OK, here goes.  I want so badly to be loved on as much as possible.  You can love on me til the cows come home!  Do you have a cow?  I am a very sweet girl.  I tolerate other dogs but would really prefer to be your one and only!   I am pretty well house-trained using a doggie door.  I may need some help with house-training if you don't have a doggie door.\n\nI like to take naps when I'm tired from playing.  I need  love, exercise, and couch-sitting when we get tired!  Let's be a team, OK?\n\n\nIf you would like to take me home (and you know you do), please email doggydarlings12@gmail.com  and she can get me on my way to a new and loving home!  My adoption fee is $200.  I am in Houston, TX but, if you live within driving distance, can you come to pick me up to go to my new home?  \n\n",

Sadly, Astro was surrendered because he does not get along with other animals; he just wants to keep his humans to himself, that's all. That being said, Astro will have to be in a home with no other animals and one with older children that know how to properly handle and approach a dog since he is scared of younger children. Astro loves curling up on his dog bed, going outside to potty and play, and playing with toys! He loves toys of all kinds, but he especially loves to shred to stuffy ones. Astro loves treats and one of his favorite treats is a nice big pig ear! Astro would do great in a home as a companion to just chill out and relax with, or maybe throw a ball around, he doesn't care as long as he is with you. This sweet boy is house-trained, crate-trained, and leash-trained and he even knows \"sit\", \"come\", and \"down\"! Astro has done great with the learning the routine here. He is current on his vaccines, microchipped and neutered, so he's ready to come home with you today! Sadly, Astro did test positive for heartworms, but don't let that deter you from adopting! His treatment is completely covered in his adoption fee! Come meet this sweetheart at the Waggin' Tails Adoption Center in Benbrook, open every day from 12-6 pm, by appointment!\n\n*If you would like to schedule an appointment, please give us a call at 817-249-3647!\n",

She likes to follow her humans around the house. She is drawn more towards men but doesn't have any issues with women. She will need an active family as she enjoys and needs to burn off her energy and she loves being outdoors and will need a physical fenced in yard to run and play. Daisy gets along with other dogs, she can be overly friendly with them when she first meets them, she spends a little more time in their face, which some dogs don't care for this. She has not been cat or child tested. Daisy is housebroken and crate trained. She does pull on leash but she's being worked with by her foster parents for this.\n\ndashrescue00@gmail.com\ndashanimalrescue.org",

I just figured out how to jump over my toys, and I will bow and wriggle my bottom when I want to play! You\u2019ll know that I\u2019m really excited if I start nibbling your fingers, but I\u2019m easy to redirect with a toy. After all that action, it\u2019s usually time for a nap.\nI\u2019m doing well using puppy pads in the house, and I LOVE going potty on a patch of backyard grass (and being praised for it!). I think I will do great on walks once I\u2019ve had all my shots!\nI\u2019m also working hard on my crate training. I love being the center of attention and feeling like I\u2019m part of the crowd. I have some FOMO, so I might whine a bit when you first put me in another room, but after a bit I\u2019ll settle down to play with a toy or sleep. Right now, I get up during the night to go potty, but I take myself to the puppy pad if I can\u2019t wait for you to take me out.\nI came from the shelter with my brother (a.k.a. the best nap partner ever), but now that he\u2019s been adopted, I\u2019m excited to find my forever home. I get along great with my human foster brothers, who are 8 and 10. I\u2019m also super curious about my foster family\u2019s three big dogs; I can\u2019t wait until I\u2019m ready to go on walks and meet new dog friends!\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2020 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq",

            "description": "Maggie is an absolutely beautiful 2.5 year old, white female German Shepherd dog. Her fosters have been calling her Maggie, which is short for Magnolia, since magnolia flowers are all white! She was surrendered to our rescue due to litter mate syndrome, which occurs when two female dog siblings grow up together.\nShe is so incredibly sweet and loving, and enjoys belly rubs and cuddling on the couch with you. She loves getting pets and she even gives pets back by placing one or both of her paws on you! \nShe aims to please her people and loves following them around. She has loved every person that she meets. They made sure right from an early age that she was comfortable with ear mouth, and paw touching. She has fairly good leash manners, but will need to continue both her leash and obedience training. Luckily, she loves treats so training her will be a fun and bonding experience for both her and her new family. She is crate trained and loves hanging out in her crate during her down time and sleeping in it at night. She loves most dog toys but really gravitates toward plush toys with squeakers, but treats them well and isn't the type of dog to tear them up!\nShe is curious about the cat in her foster family's home, so we would not recommend her going to a house with cats. While she is also living with two other dogs at her foster house, she is a bit timid and shy around other dogs, so we would also recommend that she go to a home without a dog, but to a home with previous German Shepherd experience.\n\n\n\nIf you would like to adopt Magnolia, please visit our website and apply today!\n\nhttps://www.washingtongsd.org/adopt\n\nPlease note that we require a secure fenced yard.\n\nOur hours are by appointment only. IF WE FIND YOU TO BE A GOOD MATCH YOU WILL BE CONTACTED typically within 72 hours. YOU WILL HEAR FROM US ONLY IF WE FIND YOU TO BE A GOOD MATCH FOR ONE OF OUR RESCUE ANIMALS AND OUR ADOPTION GUIDELINES/PROGRAM. WE MUST REVIEW A COMPLETED APPLICATION BEFORE A POSSIBLE APPOINTMENT IS ARRANGED. NO EXCEPTIONS. All visits with the puppies/dogs are by approved applications and appointments only.\n\n* We reserve the right to refuse any adoption without justification and not all applications or inquiries may receive a response. *\n\nThank you for your interest in our rescue dogs.",

She is very dependent on her sister (?), Belinda (Bel) and takes her ques from her.  At this point, we could not place her in a typical home environment but we think she does deserve a chance since we really do not see them as aggressive.  They will bark , offer security and will alert you if someone enters your property.  They need good shelter, nutritional food and a safe/fenced area.

Bel had puppies and they were cared for by someone who lived close.  All puppies went to homes.  Bel and Bea are extremely fearful of humans.  They are NOT aggressive  but could fear bite if pushed too far.  We have tried to work with them as much as possible and Bel is less fearful than Bea.  We were finally able to get a collar on Bel.  It is very unlikely that either will ever be a cuddly companion but if you want an outside dog who will let you know when someone or something is on your property OR if you need a dog on your shop yard for protection, these girls could work for you.  Since they are not aggressive we want to give them a chance.  They would like to be together (Bea depends on Bel for support) but do not have to be.  They just need  good nutritional food, good shelter and a safe place to live.  If you are a dog whisperer, you may be able to turn them around.  Bel will allow you to touch her and she will take a treat.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.German Shepherd dogs, as well as the other herding breeds that we have in rescue, are highly active, energetic, working breeds. They require considerable vetting, exercise, socialization, training, leadership and mental stimuli in order to be well-adjusted, well-balanced, and well-mannered dogs. Even if you exercise and play with your dog daily in your fenced yard, you MUST still take your dog out on daily walks and outings in order to work on his/her leash skills, manners, and social skills. These breeds make great additions to active families who will pamper them, but who will also work with them, as they are smart dogs who need leadership, structure, plenty of activity and mental stimulation. If you are new to German Shepherds (and other herding breeds), please research the breed to make sure this is the dog for you. We ask that you consider the time and financial commitment that your German Shepherd (or other herding breed) dog will require before applying for one. Please review the section on our website (www.heartlandgsrescue.org) 'Is a HUGS Dog Right for You?' for additional information.Hope is a sweet, shy, gorgeous girl. Prior to rescue, Hope was heavily pregnant and extremely scared at the shelter. The shelter was not able to adopt her out due to her condition (and fearfulness) and she would have been euthanized. Luckily, we were able to get her out before it was too late and she was able to have her puppies safely and comfortably in a loving foster home. From what we can tell, Hope must have been kept outdoors most of her life and must have had few, if any, positive human interactions before being rescued. Yet, Hope is incredibly sweet. While scared, she was grateful and relieved to get to safety, and to have someone care for her and her babies. Hope and all of her thirteen puppies have been thriving in their foster homes. Hope's puppies are currently looking for forever homes.Hope is a very sweet girl young who is a little shy in new situations and around new people, but she warms up with proper introductions. She gets along well with other dogs, and loves to play with the household dog. She does well with cats too (in fact, she enjoys cuddling up with kitties too). Hope loves other dogs and feels more confident with a dog buddy that she can watch for cues, learn from, and play with. Because of that, we would really like for her to have another dog in her adoptive home. Hope is doing great in her foster home. She is now potty-trained. She doesn't love the crate, but is learning to be in it for short periods of time. Hope would love a home with a loving, patient human who is around for a lot of the day to continue helping her adjust and blossom.\nThe adoption fee for Hope is $325, all of which goes back into offseting our high-cost vetting expenses and rescuing more dogs. We are a 100% volunteer-run rescue group and rely on adoption fees and donations to continue saving lives. Adoption fees include spay/neuter, current on age-appropriate vaccinations, fecal, deworming, flea/tick and heartworm preventative, heartworm tested if old enough (and treated if positive), and microchipped.\nPlease visit http://heartlandgsrescue.rescuegroups.org/info/adoption for more information about our adoption process and requirements, and to apply. Like any of our dogs, Hope would make a great addition to an active home that will provide the love, structure, good leadership, activity and mental stimulation that her breed needs. Because of that, Hope's ideal owners will have prior GSD, or other herding breed experience. Even if you exercise and play with your dog daily in your fenced yard, please remember that you MUST still take your dog out on daily walks and outings, in order to provide sufficient stimulation, ward off boredom, and work on leash skills, and manners.Please review the information in the 'About Us', 'Important Considerations' and 'Adopt' sections on our website menu, as it contains useful information about the breed, adoption fees, the adoption process and our requirements, and how meeting the dogs works.",

Bandie is great in a crate and lets her foster mom know when she needs to go outside and barks to come back in.  She gets along well with other dogs and loves to play with her foster mom.  Bandie was in really bad shape when she was rescued from a local shelter.  She had horrible teeth, a large mammary tumor, and needed to be spayed. Luckily, her tumor was benign and she does have a few teeth left.  Bandie's health had been neglected prior to her rescue so we are trying to get her kidneys in better health.  Bandie would do well with a retired person or couple who  are looking for a small, loving, quiet companion.\n\nWe are a RESCUE GROUP, not a shelter, and all of our animals are in foster homes. To start the adoption process, email us at adoptions@earstexas.org requesting an application. Submitting an application does not commit you in any way, but helps us make the best match between people and our available dogs. Your current or past dogs must be inside dogs who have been spayed/neutered and are on heartworm prevention.\n\nAll of the dogs in our program are inside dogs and are completely vetted including all vaccinations, spayed/neutered, free of internal parasites, microchipped, heartworm negative and on prevention before adoption. Our adoption process includes an application, check of vet records or personal references, interview, neutral site meet & greet with the dog and your family, and a home visit.",

He loves to play with the other dogs but the foster mom says it's like he must have lived by himself because it's like at times hard for him to \nand comes away happy because he is a fast and easy leaner.\n\nBlly Boy has heart problems that he needs to be on medicine every day for. He is doing good since he has been on meds and even has had dosage lowed. He will have to be on heart meds the rest of his life.   \n\nHe sleeps next to the foster parents  bed every night on his own bed. He is that dog that needs attention.  He loves to go for walks. Don't  leave the front door open when he first gets home he is a good runner too. Lol.\n\nIf the animal is under the age of 3 years old or has health issues, a vet reference is required which means you must own a pet or have owned a pet in your name.\n\nAdoption fee of $250. covers all vetting including spay/neuter surgery, vaccines, microchip heartworm test and treatment if needed and any other medical that may be required while in rescue. \n\nWe only do adoptions on Saturday and not all animals are able to attend so if you would like to see a specific animal please let us know so that we can make arrangements for it to be present at the event. Event locations do vary so please check the homepage to find out where we will be this week. Please do not ask us to reduce adoption fees since all fees help us to cover medical expenses for all of our animals, some of which can be very expensive.  Saving lives is not cheap so thank you for your understanding and helping us save as many as possible.\n\nPlease email lowcountryanimalrescue@ymail.com for an application.",

She plays fetch and goes into her crate when prompted. She's still learning to walk on a leash but mostly stays by your side if not leashed. She is great with other dogs no matter the size. She loves kids! She is curious about cats but they aren't fond of her. She's very alert! We like to joke that she must've been a guard dog in a past life.\n\nHow can anyone resist that adorable face! Fill out an application to make her your furever furbaby today!\n\n8 months old, 45-50 pounds, spayed, heartworm negative, chipped and up to date on vaccines.",

            "description": "Romie is a 2.5 year old male Lab mix. He weighs 66 lbs. From his foster home: Romie is a great house guest! Happy tail wagging guy. Good in the crate, goes right in when you ask. He is housetrained, always does his potty outside. Will bark if left alone, prefers to be with his people.  \n\nRomie would like best to be an only dog, although he has had certain dogs who he gets along very well with. Romie should be with a person who doesn\u2019t think he has to meet every dog he sees. \n\nHe would be a great adventure buddy with a person who wants to have fun and be a leader for Romie. He has received mixed messages in the past and needs clear praise and correction, when needed. Was fostered with a smaller female dog and played very well with her but will need a leader with him to meet new dogs. Super friendly meeting all people. Does get overwhelmed in crowds or with younger children so a quieter home with no children is best for Romie.  \n\nRomie has not been around or tested with cats. We have been using a prong collar to help as we work with him on with leash skills and engagement and it is working really well with him. Romie will dig if left outside in a fenced area unsupervised and has had a bad experience with an electric fence, so he would need patient retraining if one were to be used again. \n\nWant to Adopt? 1) Fill out an application on theluckypuppy.org . The donation fees are minimum $475 for puppies up to 6 months, minimum $400 for dogs 7 months to 6 years and minimum $ 300 for 7+ years/Special Needs. ***Certain adoptions include an additional $50 \"Spay it Forward\" program. This adoption fee assists with funding our spay/neuter service for momma dogs. 2) Once your application is in, our adoption coordinator will contact you and complete a vet check and home visit (possibly electronic). 3) Once approved, please schedule a meet and greet to see the dogs. Meet and greets are by appointment only for approved adopters.\n\nRomie is available in NY through the Go North Program of The Lucky Puppy Rescue centered in Bonifay and Panama City, FL (NY Lic #1054). The minimum donation $400 adoption fee includes transportation from FL to NY, spay/neuter surgery, vaccinations, de-worm, flea prevention, heartworm prevention and martingale safety collar. Adoption fee payment methods accepted are credit, debit, Paypal and bank checks. No personal checks or cash. Applications must be submitted through our website - theluckypuppy.org - thank you!

            "description": "Kaycee is back! Kaycee is a 5 year old white and brown boxer mix who was originally brought to the shelter as a stray and adopted. She was recently brought back because she did not do well with the younger child in the home. Kaycee does fantastic with other dogs if properly introduced and even likes cats! She will try to chase cats and try to play with them but has never harmed them in her old home. Kaycee will do better with kids over the age of 12 since she does not like her ears or collar pulled. She is also food aggressive so older children would be better for this sweet girl. Kaycee is FULLY HOUSEBROKEN and was able to free roam when left home alone. Kaycee is HEARTWORM NEGATIVE as of 7-24-20.\n\nHer adoption fee is $61.50 and she is ALREADY MICROCHIPPED! Due to the outbreak of Covid-19 our adoption policies have changed. All adoptions are by appointment only. Call to set up an appointment to meet the animal. Dogs are $61.50 and puppies are $59 unless otherwise noted. All cats and kittens are $44 unless otherwise noted. Our system automatically updates petfinders every two hours. Feel free to email us with any questions you may have.",

            "description": "Jasmine and Queenie are bonded siblings and need to be adopted together. These girls are 9 month old female Pointer mixes. \n\n***They are shy dogs that need a quiet home and adopters who are committed to patience as they acclimate to their new family. This takes 3 months for dogs normally and can take longer with timid animals***\n\nUpdates from their foster mom:\n\nBoth Queenie and Jasmine are real sweethearts who just need some time to open up. Queenie loves to cuddle and hang out on the couch with you, Jazzie likes to stay close on her dog bed. She\u2019s very anxious at first but after a few weeks she\u2019s running towards you for playtime and treats just as Queenie does. \n\nBoth girls have moderate energy and are really low maintenance- they are okay to be on their own for a while. They\u2019d be great for someone who\u2019s working from home! \n\nThe girls favorite time is being outside - as long as they can play catch on a long leash, they\u2019re happy. They prefer to run around with each other to going on walks! \n\nIn the last few weeks, they\u2019ve picked up \u2018sit\u2019 and \u2018stay\u2019, recall is improving as well. Both are very smart and picking new tricks up after a few days. They would benefit from a quieter household who could provide a structured day for them. They\u2019ve met our family and are okay with new people - both were a bit wary of men at first but Queenie got used to them quickly. \n\nJasmine is definitely anxious around men, she\u2019s not really comfortable with my husband. Also, any noises (garage door opening, Hoover, shoveling the deck) puts them on alert. They\u2019re nervous around cars and need a firm hand when walking. Driving in the car is okay as long as they\u2019re in their crate. Both are mainly house trained, they only had accidents in the morning of we didn\u2019t go outside immediately.\n\nJasmine (black) aka Jazzy Girl has the biggest sweetest brown eyes. She is very unsure of things and would benefit from some confidence building. She really is a gentle soul.  \n\nQueenie (white) is an absolute doll. She loves to run and play! We take her out on the 30ft long line and she likes to run around. Queenie definitely does best with mental stimulation. She likes to be doing something. \nCheck out this video of her working with the trainer: https://www.facebook.com/192380617472576/videos/1148855422199480/\n\nShe really liked all the kids she met on transport arrival day but because she would benefit from a calm low key household, would be best with kids 10+ years and older, if any. \n\nWant to Adopt? 1) Fill out an application on theluckypuppy.org . The donation fees are minimum $475 for puppies up to 6 months, minimum $400 for dogs 7 months to 6 years and minimum $ 300 for 7+ years/Special Needs. ***Certain adoptions include an additional $50 \"Spay it Forward\" program. This adoption fee assists with funding our spay/neuter service for momma dogs. 2) Once your application is in, our adoption coordinator will contact you and complete a vet check and home visit (possibly electronic). 3) Once approved, please schedule a meet and greet to see the dogs. Meet and greets are by appointment only for approved adopters.\n\nJasmine and Queenie are available in NY through the Go North Program of The Lucky Puppy Rescue centered in Bonifay and Panama City, FL (NY Lic #1054). The combined minimum donation $800 adoption fee includes their transportation from FL to NY,  each of their spay surgeries, vaccinations, de-worm, flea prevention, heartworm prevention and martingale safety collars.

Their owner passed away and they were left on their own for about 6 months. Reno's leg was injured during that time and needed amputated. This happy tripod gets around very well and even enjoys short walks.\n\nReno loves everyone he meets. He loves to give kisses and play with Nevada.  These two are looking for a home with older kids and no cats. They would do OK with a mellow dog.  Adoption fee for both is $250.\n\nTo see more information on Nevada, https://www.petfinder.com/dog/nevada-and-reno-50135058\n\nTo apply for Reno and Nevada please fill out an application at www.maggiesmissionrescue.org.",

He loves playing with other dogs and enjoys sunbathing. Wyatt really loves being close to his humans so cuddling is his favorite thing to do. He is house trained and knows to go to his kennel when you tell him. He does need some help staying in his kennel when you leave as he is super smart and can escape if the kennel isn\u2019t secure! Wyatt loves kids but can be a little mouthy when he gets excited. He will need a home with a fenced in backyard so he has room to run off energy.",

            "description": "Niko is a 2.5 year old male Husky and Shepherd mix. He weighs 63 lbs. Niko is a handsome, independent guy. He\u2019s the best of both worlds; he is fun and enjoys adventure but also enjoys a slumber on the couch. An adopter with experience with Shepherds or Huskies or similar breeds will bring out the best in him. If you set the tone for structure, he loves it, and quickly connects and wants to work and get attention. \n\nModerate to high energy level. He is built for adventure! Niko is good with most other dogs but some bold teenager-types get on his nerves. NOT a dog park type dog due to this. (We don't think they are often too great for any dog but that's another story. Feel free to ask, we will share.) Some food drive, some toy drive, likes to work and please his person. 12+ year old kids or younger dog-savvy kids due to size. \n\nHe is great in the car, loves to hop in and go for a ride. Has been out in the world to the pet store and met new people and a huge male mastiff and was great! Niko is a cool dog he just need someone with some leadership skills who wants to go have some fun together. \n\nWant to Adopt? 1) Fill out an application on theluckypuppy.org . The donation fees are minimum $475 for puppies up to 6 months, minimum $400 for dogs 7 months to 6 years and minimum $ 300 for 7+ years/Special Needs. ***Certain adoptions include an additional $50 \"Spay it Forward\" program. This adoption fee assists with funding our spay/neuter service for momma dogs. 2) Once your application is in, our adoption coordinator will contact you and complete a vet check and home visit (possibly electronic). 3) Once approved, please schedule a meet and greet to see the dogs. Meet and greets are by appointment only for approved adopters.\n\nNiko is available in NY through the Go North Program of The Lucky Puppy Rescue centered in Bonifay and Panama City, FL (NY Lic #1054). The minimum donation $400 adoption fee includes transportation from FL to NY, spay/neuter surgery, vaccinations, de-worm, flea prevention, heartworm prevention and martingale safety collar. Adoption fee payment methods accepted are credit, debit, Paypal and bank checks. No personal checks or cash. Applications must be submitted through our website - theluckypuppy.org - thank you!

Their owner died and they found themselves on their own for about 6 months. They are a super sweet pair who are low maintenance and just love to be together and lay on a soft pillow.\n\nNevada is about 36 pounds and looks to be a chi mix. She has adorable ears and an adorable way of crossing her legs when she lays on her pillow.  Nevada is housebroken and likes to go on short walks. \n\nNevada will do best in a home with a fenced yard. She has potential to do  OK with another mellow dog after proper introduction.  Since she is older she can be a little nervous around fast movements and would do better with older children. \n\nTo see more information on Reno, https://www.petfinder.com/dog/reno-and-nevada-50135305\nIf you would like to add Nevada and Reno to your family, please fill out an application at www.maggiesmissionrescue.org.",

She is on a diet to help her trim down as BYC wants her to have a healthy heart to love her furever family for years to come. She may be 5 but she has the soul of a puppy and can't wait to go on walking and hiking adventures with you. She loves to play and smell all the flowers along the pathway. Lilly is a wonderful dog in the house, but can be very strong outdoors. We recommend a home with a fenced yard as this would give Lilly plenty of room to run and play, while also keeping her safe. So please consider adopting Lilly and adding her furry face to your family .\n\nLilly's adoption fee is $250 which includes her spay, vaccinations (rabies, distemper, lepto), microchip, heartworm test and flea and heartworm prevention. Also, six weeks of obedience classes if you chose to do so.\n\nDUE TO COVID-19 RESTRICTIONS: TO HELP US LIMIT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE BUILDING, OUR ADOPTION CENTER IS OPEN BY APPOINTMENT ONLY TO APPROVED APPLICANTS. PLEASE FILL OUT THE ADOPTION APPLICATION IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO MEET LILLY. FILLING OUT AN APPLICATION DOES NOT OBLIGATE YOU TO ADOPT.",

I love people (especially people who will play ball and tug with me).  Dogs are \"ok\" as long as I don't have to share my person, toys or my house with them (truth is I would really prefer to be the only dog in the home so that I can be the center of attention).   Cats are a definite \"no\" as are small/young children (I am still very puppy like and can be mouthy and nippy at times).  My foster moms says I have amazing endurance. I'm not sure what that means; but I sure do love running! A furever family that would take me on lots of outdoor adventures would be my dream!  I am house-broken, crate-trained and learning not to pull on a leash. I'm neuterd and up-to-date on my vaccinations. If you are interested in meeting me, please contact kathie@herdinghaven.org.",

            "description": "Solstice is a year and a half old medium mixed breed baby.  She is an absolute sweetheart!!  She loves people!  She has never met a stranger.  Upon meeting Solstice you will immediately be showered with hugs and kisses.  She loves to jump up on people and just wrap them up in her paws.  She is very much a lap dog!  She is most content when siting in someone's lap getting petted.  She is still a young girl with plenty of energy for playing, running, and walking.  She does well on a leash and loves to go out and about, making new friends.  She loves to play with toys.  Fetch is her favorite game as well as burying her toys in order to find them again later.  She does get along well with all people including children.  She will need to be the solitary pet of the household.  You must make an appointment to meet Solstice.  You will need to call the shelter before hand if you have any questions about her, our adoption process, or if you would like to meet her.  Our phone number is (828) 488-0418.",

If you have experience working on impulse control and basic manners with dogs, you will have this smart, exuberant boy shaped up in no time! He is as smart as they come and eager to learn if you make it worth his while. He knows sit, shake, down, and drop it (he loves fetch!) He is working on manners in his kennel and is doing really well. He now sits and waits patiently while his dropped ball is being retrieved, food is being served, harness is being put on (and taken off.) He likes to play with other dogs, but might not want to share his personal belongings with them. He would likely do best as an only dog, at least to start, so the focus can be on his training. Puck would also prefer a home without young children (unless they LIKE being knocked over and having their toys stolen and destroyed!)",

The more she stays occupied the better she does. She is crate and house trained. Does well with dogs her size and cats. She can be overwhelmed with larger dogs. She occasionally has some mild resource guarding so will need a family that understands and knows how to manage her. She does not like the busy energy of small children and will not be placed in a home with children or grandchildren under age 12 or a home that plans to have children in the near future.

He does best with female dogs his size. He will need a large fenced yard to help him get some energy out.\n",

He's a high energy guy who loves to play ball and will need a home that has the time and energy to keep him busy and active. Indy didn't learn boundaries well in the past and when he gets stressed he uses his grumble. He will need a new home with a family who is dog savvy and understands dog behavior cues well and can help Indy reset when his stress level goes up. He will need positive training / reinforcement to learn new ways to handle his stress. Indy has good basic training and can easily reset with proper cues, guidance and patience. Once he trusts he can be a happy love bug. Indy will not be placed in a home with children or grandchildren under age 18.",

            "description": "In a word Tuco is \"challenging.\"   This little guy is BIG on personality and will need a home that is accepting of his many flaws.  Tuco cant be in a home with any other pets except a dog.  Tuco will relentlessly chase, bark and fuss and anything with 4 legs or feathers.  Aside from his obsession with other animals Tuco is fussy with new people and will act aggressively until he gets to know them.  Lastly is his house training or lack there of.  Tuco will need to be in a male diaper in the house as he likes to mark his turf.  Its safe to say Tuco has a troubled past and was not in the best of homes,  He was found as a stray after being abandoned at a local park.  Tuco was thin, dirty had significant hair loss and was very distant with any people.  Now Tuco is at a great weight has a shinny coat and loves his foster Mom.  Tuco seeks attention and loves to cuddle in front of the TV.  Tuco really needs a family that understands that this may be as good as it gets for him and love him for who he is flaws and all.",

He has begun to trust our staff, but will need to meet potential adopters multiple times before he feels comfortable enough with them to go home. Ray has tested well with other dogs, especially small gentle dogs. He needs a calm and quiet home without children.

            "description": "Breed: American Bully\nSex: Male\nDOB: ~12/15/2016\nWeight: ~70 lbs (low-rider, but stocky!)\nEnergy Level: Low-Medium \nPersonality Type: Sweet, Goofy, Playful, Velcro Dog!!!\nHistory: Owner Surrender\nGood With: Most Dogs\nFence Requirements: Preferred \nIdeal Home: Dog experienced home! No cats or kids (teenagers ok!). Apartments may be ok.\nSpecial Info: Max is good on a leash, good in the car, loves toys and big comfy beds! He does not jump on furniture and will sleep quietly in a crate.\n\nThe information we are providing for this animal was developed based on observations and assessments in a shelter or foster environment. We do our best to provide information that will help determine if the dog might be a good fit for you. Please note that behaviors may change in a home environment. We also ask our applicants to assume that any animal they adopt from us will need to be potty trained and learn house manners, although this is not always the case. Our online animal bios are designed to provide as much information as possible and answer some anticipated questions. We do not have the resources to respond to emails with more specific questions.\n\nWe are receiving an unusually high number of applications per pet at this time! Please follow the rules below to ensure your application is reviewed; pay attention closely to these instructions because applications will NOT be processed if they are not followed. Please keep in mind that dog/cat availability is currently changing by the hour; you will receive an email if the animal you are interested in is no longer available. New dogs become available almost every day, so feel free to let us know if someone else interests you if your initial choice is already adopted! \n\nFill out the application (DOG: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IHD-DOG-Application-9-10-18.pdf, CAT: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IHD-CAT-Application.pdf) completely. Every question must be answered, and it must be signed. If you are going to type your responses, open the application, save it, type your answers, and save it again. \n\n-Applicants must be 21+ years old and live within a 50-mile radius of our shelter at 22415 Groesbeck Hwy, Warren 48089.\n\n-You must identify at least 1 dog/cat that you are interested in. If there are multiple dogs/cats, number them in order of priority. \n\n-Scan a copy of proof of home ownership (i.e. tax bill, deed, or mortgage payment - you can black out the account #, etc.) or animal clause/agreement of your rental agreement.\n\n-Attach the application and home ownership proof/rental agreement animal clause to a new email and send it to bark@iheartdogs.org. The subject line must be formatted to read \"\"#1 choice of dog/cat, Your First and Last Name\"\". Example: Subject: Fido, Jane Doe\nOnce your application is received, it will be assigned to an Adoption Counselor who will follow-up with the applicant who is the best fit within a few days, or to discuss other dogs/cats. It could take up to a couple of weeks for you to receive a final disposition on your application so there is no need to check on the status.\n\n-Introductions will be scheduled by appointment only, 45 minutes per appointment. The entire household, including current dogs, must be present for the appointment. The introductions will take place outside in our parking lot.\n\n-We will continue to perform vet checks for current and prior pets in the household.\n\n-Home visits will be in person for the yard and virtual for inside the home.\n\n-Finalizing the adoption will also be scheduled by appointment.\n\nWhile this process may seem cumbersome, it is interim during COVID-19, and it is designed to help us respond to the volume of emails we receive every day. Since we are receiving a high volume of applications, please be patient if a dog/cat is no longer available. \n\nThank you for your understanding.",

Timber is friendly with other dogs, but not good with cats (will chase).\n\nTimber is a playful and loving pup! She loves people very much and loves pets-she is comfortable with head pets, ear scratches, and loves a good belly rub. She tends to jump up on people so we are working on the \"down\" command. She also playfully bites at you- we are teaching her not to do that. We are also training her on \"sit\", \"lay\", \"drop\", \"wait\", \"stay\", and \"slow\" (she gets very excited on walks and pulls). She is already getting better but will need more training.\n\nTimber has lots of energy and has been enjoying plenty of walks and runs with her foster family. She will need an active pawrent or family and maybe a fenced-in yard to run off-leash.\n\nTimber is doing okay with her foster family's dog, a seven year old female rottweiler mix. Primarily, she wants to play with her all the time! She is displaying some aggression around toys as well as food and water. We are currently working on this with her but haven't felt comfortable yet leaving the two dogs alone together for this reason.\n\nTimber has been sleeping in a crate at night and she is doing very well. She whines for only a few minutes and then sleeps through the night with no issues. She has been very good with potty breaks-she has only had one accident in the house (on her first day here).\n\nOverall, Timber is a loving puppy who requires lots of exercise/activity and some additional training. She would do best with a yard and either as the only dog or paired with an older, dominant dog who will tell her when play time goes on too long or gets too aggressive. We've loved having her as a foster and we're excited for her to find her perfect furever home!\n\nIf you're interested in adopting,\nplease submit an adoption interest application at the link below\n\nhttps://redemptionroadrescue.rescuegroups.org/forms/form?formid=4003\n\nredemptionroad.mn@gmail.com\n\nAll dogs age appropriate vetted:\n\nSpayed or Neutered\nRabies vaccine\nDHPP vaccine\n4DX test (@8 months or older)\nMicrochipped\nDewormed\nFlea/tick prevention",

Amy is very playful and energetic and needs work on training. Amy is affectionate and loves attention. She does do pretty well with keeping a clean enclosure. She will need someone willing to make sure she gets lots of exercise to burn of her go-go energy. We haven't had Amy with other dogs yet but she doesn't seem to mind them when she is next to them in the play yards, but Amy does not care for cats at all. She does pull quite a bit when walking on a leash so that is something that will need to be worked on as well, she is very strong! To apply for Amy, fill out an adoption application on our website, www.humanesocietyofnwia.com. Adoption Fee: $300 Arrive: October 2020",

This combined with his super SMARTS makes him a great candidate for training. He is working really hard right now and has learned a few basic commands and keeps a clean kennel. His puppy energy and attention span can get in the way but he tries SUPER hard. Max is selective of the dogs he likes to spend time with and is not a fan of most cats. If Max sounds like the right fit for your home, feel free to jump on our website humanesocietyofnwia.com and fill out our adoption application and we will take it from there!",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Arlo is a handsome boy who loves people and food. He is rather chunky right now, but loves his walks, so he is slowly but surely working on dropping the extra pounds.\n\nArlo needs to be the only dog in his furever home.\n\nEven though he is 7, he is still playful and he loves a good game of chase or tug. He is really strong, but will obey the command \"drop it\" if you ask him to. He never met a squeaker he didn't want to liberate from being trapped inside a toy - his toy de-stuffing game is strong!\n\nHe is very obedient and takes his lead from you. If you are feeling lazy, he is happy to be your cuddle bug. If it's time to run around he is happy to play. He would prefer to sleep in the bed with you, but will settle for his own cozy bed if he can be near you. He will go in a crate, but he is not a fan. His foster reports that crating is not a necessity for him; he is trustworthy to leave out around the house when she is gone.\n\nHe is perfectly house trained, but not fond of going out in the rain. He would rather wait to do his business later than go out in the rain. He is quick to get his business out of the way so he can enjoy the rest of his walk.\n\nHe knows sit, lie down, wait, drop it, shake and that he has to sit perfectly still when it is time to put the leash on. He is still learning not to pull during walks, but he is making good progress. On car rides, he knows how to roll the window down, so making sure the child-lock is engaged is a must.\n\nIf Arlo sounds like the perfect pup for you, submit an application to adopt him today!",

I am an active 65lb puppy at heart.\n\nI do require plenty of exercise and if I had someone to hike or run with, that would be ideal....if you can keep up! I am quite the lover and everyone says that I am a big goofball!\n\nI was rescued from a shelter in Houston Texas where my previous owner surrendered me and my brother. Before that we were kept outside on a chain. I was scheduled to be euthanized when Wag Again Rescue jumped in and saved me from death.\n\nNow that I have seen love and how it is to be with a family, my eyes have been opened to a whole new world! I am fun, curious, intelligent, and a happy active girl. I love to explore new places and learn new things! With a proper introduction, I am a bit dog selective. My preference is to be an only dog, but I have been able to do well with dogs that are my size. I do like to chase cats, which is heavily frowned upon, so I probably should refrain from living with them. I am a big girl and my foster family has said that I do better with older kids. Otherwise, I am pretty easy-going and happy!\n\n\nI am currently being fostered in Houston, Texas as I search for my furever home. Once I find the perfect home, Wag Again will schedule me for transport to the PNW. Transport fees are $200 (this is separate from the adoption fee) as this fee is set by the transport company. All transports are done by ground, because those airplanes can be very scary.\n\n\n\nThank you for your interest in a Wag Again dog!\n",

Transport fee is included in adoption costs***\n\nI love this idiot all the time but ESPECIALLY when he's like this. He's the quirkiest weirdo but he's such a good dog. He's still very much a puppy, loves to prance and bunny hop and chew. He flea bites when you stop petting him. He snarls just before he kisses you ever so gently and fully. He's picky about his doggie friends and protective of his toys but has shown that he can learn to get along. He's the 2nd best cuddler in the whole wide world. He's house trained and crate trained. He doesnt tear up his blankets or beds. Cats are not a good idea. He loves to chase. Somebody needs to love him.\nLincoln was brought to us after his owners requested he be euthanized bc he had heartworms. An otherwise healthy dog only a year old. we immediately accepted him. soon after we discovered that he'd clearly been abused. he cowers when you reach for him and is so unsure of everything. but once he gets comfortable has the quirkiest personality. he just needs a day or two to get his bearings\n\nhes been treated for heartworms and has the all clear from the vet to be. adopted and loved forever!!\n\nplease direct any questions about Lincoln to outoftheashespbr@gmail.com",

Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue:9/21/2020\nReason for being in rescue: Surrendered by owners to local animal control\nFoster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SC\nSpecial Needs? Petey Pickles was neutered and had a dental polishing on 11/27/20. He's up to date on all vaccines and heartworm negative. Petey has luxating patellas in both of his rear legs (grade 3 on his left knee and grade 2 on his right knee). He is on eye medicine which he absolutely hates (and will nip at you while putting them in if he can)!\nWeight: 10.5 lbs - Petey is underweight. He needs to gain 2-3 pounds\nHeight: 9 in\nSpayed/Neutered: No\n\nAdoption Fee: $249\n\nFence needed? No\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Petey Pickles is a picky, peculiar dog. He can be moody and grouchy and absolutely requires an experienced owner. Petey is selective about other dogs and absolutely hates cats. PETEY IS LOOKING FOR A MALE-ONLY HOME (NO CHILDREN) WITH EXPERIENCED OWNERS WHERE HE WILL BE THE ONLY PET.\n\nWhat is my personality like? Oh Petey. We sure wonder what life must have been like before you were surrendered to the shelter. Petey arrived in rescue with long, matted hair that hadn't been groomed in some time. He was scared and in pain and angry at the world. Our first order of business was a haircut, and that alone did wonders for this boy's demeanor. It's amazing how much better (and nicer) you feel when you aren't walking around in pain all day.\n\nPetey is moody. He can be quite grouchy, but once he adjusts to an environment and a person he is okay. Petey LOVES treats and will become your very best friend for a treat. If you have treats in your pocket he'll curl up in your lap and snuggle. And he's very gentle when taking treats from your hand. Clearly he understands that treats are rewards.\n\nPetey has done well with short walks. Given his luxating patellas in the rear legs he is not a dog that can go on multi-mile walks every day. Slow and steady is the pace for this boy. Petey is crate trained. The crate is his safe place and he enjoys lounging in his bed inside his crate. He did great on his transport to the farm and really enjoyed the ride.\n\nPetey is well loved by his caregivers at the rescue. But we also recognize that he is a special dog that is going to take just the right special owner. Petey needs a home environment that is quiet and relaxed. He needs an owner with lots of experience and patience to teach and show him that not all humans are mean. He needs to be the only pet and really wants a home that is all men.\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people?\n\nOther tips and tidbits: Petey's estimated birthday is 9/21/2010\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

No\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Ellie is young and active. She needs a family that can keep up with her energy and personality! Ellie is looking for a home with another active medium to large dog to play with and a younger couple to be in charge of (cats are okay too). She'd be great with kids over 8. She is quite bossy when she wants something and needs strong, confident owners to continue to learn from. Ellie needs LOTS of exercise and play time. She absolutely hates to be left and is best suited for a home where someone works from home or is home during the day.\n\nWhat is my personality like? Ellie arrived in rescue very pregnant. She gave birth to 5 beautiful puppies, all of whom have found their forever homes. Now it is Ellie's time to shine!\n\nEllie is an extrovert! She is outgoing with people and dogs and never meets a stranger. She is highly active and needs lots of physical and mental stimulation on a daily basis. She can be bossy when she really wants something, but really loves and seeks out other dogs.\n\nEllie has been in a foster home for 3+ months. She's learning all about being a well-mannered pet. She walks well on a leash. She loves to ride in a car. She is doing exceptionally well with potty training and will wait at the back door when ready to go out. She knows sit and is learning stay. Ellie is extremely food motivated and will work for treats. She sleeps peacefully in a bed full of dogs at night and is as soft, squishy and sweet as a cupcake!\n\nEllie is young and curious. She is mischievous and needs someone to watch her closely. Left to her devices Ellie will counter surf and empty trash cans. Foster mom is working hard with her on this, but to Ellie this is still a game. She can also climb 4 and 6-foot fences and will dart out a door if she thinks you are leaving without her.\n\nEllie is a young dog who is really just getting to learn what being a dog is all about and she loves it! She is full of personality and puts a smile on every face she meets!\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people?

I am an active 65lb puppy at heart.\n\nI do require plenty of exercise and if I had someone to hike or run with, that would be ideal....if you can keep up! I am quite the lover and everyone says that I am a big goofball!\n\nI was rescued from a shelter in Houston Texas where my previous owner surrendered me and my brother. Before that we were kept outside on a chain. I was scheduled to be euthanized when Wag Again Rescue jumped in and saved me from death.\n\nNow that I have seen love and how it is to be with a family, my eyes have been opened to a whole new world! I am fun, curious, intelligent, and a happy active girl. I love to explore new places and learn new things! With a proper introduction, I am a bit dog selective. My preference is to be an only dog, but I have been able to do well with dogs that are my size. I do like to chase cats, which is heavily frowned upon, so I probably should refrain from living with them. I am a big girl and my foster family has said that I do better with older kids. Otherwise, I am pretty easy-going and happy!\n\nI am currently being fostered in Houston, Texas as I search for my furever home. Once I find the perfect home, Wag Again will schedule me for transport to the PNW. Transport fees are $200 (this is separate from the adoption fee) as this fee is set by the transport company. All transports are done by ground, because those airplanes can be very scary.\n\n\n\nThank you for your interest in a Wag Again dog!\n",

            "description": "This little cutie goes by the name Lexa. She is such a snuggle bug, as you can see from the photos.\n\nAt 8 months of age, Lexa is brimming with puppy energy. She arrived in Maine earlier this month along with her siblings, Serena, Venus, Sherlock and Holmes. Because she was with her litter mates for a prolonged period of time, she is a bit insecure being on her own, and will need at least one other dog in the home to help her gain confidence in her new surroundings.\n\nLexa loves to play with other pups, and is still in the chewy puppy stage. She is learning what is appropriate to munch on, and what isn't. Lots of chew toys are a must! She is working on mastering her house-training skills, and is improving daily.\n\nUpdate from Lexa's foster mom: \"Lexa had a fun day today! She got to go trail hiking with us, which she absolutely loved. She is such a ham when she wants her belly scratched. She\u2019ll roll on her back an do the Superman stretch!\"\n\nLexa is believed to be a Husky/Shepherd/Collie mix. She currently weighs about 35 lbs. and has been spayed. Lexa has a heart worm negative status. She is being fostered in western Maine.\n\nAdoption fees cover age specific vaccinations, spay/neuter, microchip, heartworm/lyme/ehrlichia test, worming and transport fees. \n\nAdoption fees: \nThrough 6 months of age $450; \n7 months to through 5 years $400; \n6 years and under 9 years $325: bonded pairs are $500; \n9 years and older $250: bonded pairs are $300 \n\nFOR PUPPIES: PLEASE READ!!\nHomes considering Puppies must be prepared for:\nFlexible Schedules for Potty Training. Puppies can only hold urine for one hour per month of age. Crate Training for the next 10 months to keep them safe from chewing on everything in your home. Supervision with Children and Obedience training. \nSocialization; both with new people, children and other dogs outside of the home.\nHomes that want a well behaved dog, must be prepared to put the time, effort and costs associated to train a puppy. Well behaved dogs are not born, they are trained!  Please do not apply for a puppy if you cannot or do not have the time for a puppy.\n\nAlmost Home Rescue of New England is a 501 c 3 non-profit rescue; rescuing dogs since 2005. All Adoption applications are completed on line at www.almosthomerescue.net \n\nThis dog is available unless it is marked as Pending, meaning Pending Adoption. This dog is in foster care locally, ONLY if Maine or New Hampshire is listed next to the dogs name; otherwise, the dog is still waiting with our partner rescue for an adoption or foster home in New England. \n\nPLEASE NOTE - We will check your veterinary reference, to ensure that current and prior dogs have a history of being kept up to date on rabies and distemper, have had annual heartworm tests, and are on heartworm preventative at least 6 months of the year. Current pets must by spayed/neutered. \n\nImported dogs are transported on a USDA approved transport with a Health Certificate. All imported dogs are quarantined 14 days prior to getting on transport.",

She has been in foster home with human children ages 2 and 9; she likes kids and is protective of her small humans. She loves affection and snuggles. She came to us with 6 adorable pups in tow; she was a great mom to her babies and now she is seeking a home of her own. She also came to us with heartworms and is seeking and a foster who will continue LCAR\u2019s provided treatment at no cost. She weighs 40 pounds and is full grown. This pup is microchipped. We believe you can always teach an \u2018old\u2019 dog new tricks, so we highly recommend continued obedience training for this smart pup; it stimulates the dog's mind and establishes a good dog/adopter relationship. This pup, like all pups, should be on heartworm preventative; an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. If you are interested in adopting this dog, and are already approved to adopt through our organization, please contact dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with the pup\u2019s name and ID number in the subject line. OTHERWISE, please submit an adoption application online: http://www.lastchanceanimalrescue.org/adoptus.html E-mail dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with questions.

            "description": "Meet Buckeye and Brutus! These boys love each other, and where one is you\u2019ll find the other. They do everything together, from playing to eating to sleeping. Buckeye and Brutus would do well with an active family in a home with a fenced yard where they have plenty of room to run and wrestle. The boys can get a bit barky at the fence, so a lower-traffic area would be best. We haven\u2019t seen how Buckeye or Brutus do with cats yet. If you are looking for a couple of pups who love playing and cuddling with people as much as they love each other, then Buckeye and Brutus are the boys for you.  They are very food motivated (and not picky about food/will take medicine easily) and have learned to sit.  \nBrutus is 1 yr, 48lbs. \nBuckeye  is 1yr, 32lbs.  (Buckeye is the smaller, brown dog)\n\nRequirements for Adoption:\nSorry but we only place our dogs in the Columbus area.  For rescues/shelters across Ohio, visit:  ColumbusDogConnection.com/RescuesShelters.html\nMust be over the age of 24 to adopt.\nYour resident pets must be spayed/neutered.\n\nAdoption Process:\nWe do not have an application. Adoptions are pet-adopter driven.\nTo meet our pets:\nCall our office at 614-471-9000 or click on the pet which you are interested in and send email. We will be happy to discuss the adoption process with you and set-up a visit at time of contact. The foster dogs are in foster homes and most of the cats reside at our office.\n\nThe adoption process includes a lease manager reference (if applicable) , a veterinarian reference, a home-visit (in-person or virtual).\nIf you've never owned a pet, part of our adoption process requires that you call several vet offices to compare services, prices, and availability. \nQuestions to ask include:\nHow many doctors are at your practice?\nCan I request to see a specific Vet or would I be scheduled with first available?\nWhat are your hours?\nHow much is:   annual exam, heartworm test & tablets, an x-ray,  vaccines, a non-emergency office call? \nDo you recommend vaccines every year or every three years?  (every 3 yrs as suggested by the AVMA)           \n\nThe pooches that visit your home will not be left there at the end of the visit. We take them back home with us so your family can discuss to ensure he/she is a good fit for your home.\n\nThere is an adoption agreement and adoption fees as follows:\n $300 for Adult Dogs (6yrs  & younger)\n $200 for Senior Dogs (7 yrs and older)\n $80 for Cats  \n\n All pets are spayed/neutered, up-to-date on vaccinations, heartworm tested (dogs), fiv/leukemia tested (cats), & micro-chipped.\nKnown medical conditions are discussed at time of inquiry.",

            "description": "1/19/2021\n\nMeet Hank. Hank is a 1 yrs old Redtick Coonhound. Hank was originally bred by a hunting breeder. After he was placed in a home, his owner became ill and Hank ended up in another home. Sadly, Hank was off lead and was lost for 3 months where he was on his own. He was caught by Granite State Dog Recovery but not with some fearful baggage. We have had Hank for 4 weeks and he has made leaps and bounds in the confidence department. He was originally afraid of everything (except for other dogs) and does show continued fearful reactions with new sounds and fast movements. He has NEVER shown any aggression to people or dogs and plays very week with his canine friends. He does much better with canine company so a confident canine companion or two would be awesome for him. Hank is coming more out of his shell everyday and seeks affection now and is extremely loving.  He loves to play, loves bones and toys of all kinds and has that silly Hound personality. Due to his fear and flight risks, his evaluation deemed him not suitable for hunting, ever so if you are looking for a hunting companion, Hank is not it. \nHank will do best in a home with other dogs and a family that will be willing to work with introducing him to new things and people in an appropriate manner. He has started leash training and walks on leash like a dream. He is a high energy guy and will need a fenced in yard.\nHe is a super sweet and goofy boy that will thrive in a home with routine and lots of love. \nIf you are interested in finding out more about Hank, you can fill out an application from peaceandpaws.org to begin the application process. Once approved you can set up a time to meet Hank. \nAdoption fee is $475 and includes his neuter, vaccinations, microchip, fecal/heartworm test, dewormings and health certificate.",

            "description": "Tripp is the true definition of a Cattle Dog. That could be taken as a good thing or a problem.  He isn\u2019t a good match for the average dog owner. He isn\u2019t a city house dog. He needs a strong owner that has experience with the Cattle Dog breed.  He needs space to run and explore. And he must be kept busy with a job; activities that will make him work physically and mentally. We do not recommend small children or cats because of his herding nature.\nThis smart boy walks like a dream on a leash, has great handler awareness, is food motivated, is no problem when crated, enjoys playing fetch and herding balls, and knows basic commands such as heel, sit, come, down and stay.  \nIn the right environment, with an owner(s) that understand the needs of this breed, Tripp will be happy and make a great companion.\n\nage:  5 years\n\nadoption fee:  $250\n\nTo contact Multiple Breed Rescue for further information or to have an adoption application sent to you by email, click the green ASK ABOUT button above.

We already placed his mom (KB\u2019s Jumbo Jet), two of his littermates (Keeper Jet Air & Keeper Jet Stream) and two half siblings from another litter. Let\u2019s just say all his relatives are awesome and the acorn has not fallen far from the tree with this one. He is big, smart and has the best personality! Food driven, he will be easy to train.  He does want to be in the room with you.  He will kennel up for food but don\u2019t leave him in too long or he will tell you about it. Liner is vocal, therefore probably not suited for apartment living. \n\nThe FastK9's Adoption fee is $400.00.  Jet Liner has been neutered, microchipped, is current on vaccinations and has tested negative for heartworm, erlichia and lymes disease.\n\nTo find out more or to stay up to date on all the greyt-ness follow us on: \nFacebook: /fastk9s\nInstagram: /fastk9s_adoption\nWeb: fastk9s.org",

            "description": "Meet Norah! She is around 2 years old and we think she is a Hound and possibly Shepherd or Doberman mix. Whatever she is, this beautiful girl has a gentle, cautious nature. Norah came to Labs & More extremely shy and scared but has transformed into a friendly, adventurous dog! As her confidence grows, so does her energy. Kids move a little too fast for Norah, so she would do best in a home with children 10 or older, if any at all. She LOVES taking walks and going on hikes. Her leash manners are still being worked on, but she responds well to correction. Norah can be timid with new people, but if they get on her level, she'll cautiously approach them with tail wags and kisses, especially if treats are involved. She does well with other dogs so long as they're respectful of her space she doesn't want a puppy jumping around, trying to play with her. She is definitely more comfortable around smaller dogs, but she is fine with mellow, larger dogs too. Most new things take time for Norah to warm up to. While she doesn't live with a cat, she has seen a few on her walks. She just keeps her distance and shows some curiosity, sometimes warning the kitty not to get too close to her. She likes to bow and stick her tush up in the air when she plays, then paw and nudge you; perhaps this is what she would do with a feline friend over time! Norah definitely still has some puppy tendencies. She is good at chewing on dog toys instead of other household items, but every once in a while, she needs to be reminded. She is great at self-entertaining and when she hears an interesting noise (like tummy grumbles or sirens), she tilts her head from side to side with that puppy curiosity. Once she is comfortable in her environment, she bounces around with plush toys and ropes, or grabs a bone to chew on. Norah is house trained in her current foster home and stands by the back door when it's time to go potty. She is working on her crate training but has been fine with the run of the downstairs when left alone. She also chooses to sleep downstairs on the couch and is not much of an early bird. Norah would do best in home with a big yard for her to get her zoomies out, or with a very active family we're talking multiple walks per day or some good, structured runs. She'd be a great adventure buddy for an active adopter as she builds her confidence. Norah no longer gets anxious for car rides! Now that she is comfortable with her foster family, she hops right into the car and waits patiently for her destination. She needs a family that will continue working on her socialization and confidence, but she's already made a 180 in just a couple of weeks. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting Norah, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps.

Heartworm disease is relatively common in the United States, so we are in need of caring adopters like YOU that are willing to open their home to a dog with heartworm disease. You are truly saving a life by adopting a heartworm positive dog!\n\nAll heartworm treatment expenses are the responsibility of the adopter.Due to COVID-19 protocols have changed.\n\nAdoptions: If a person would like to adopt a pet, we encourage you to continue to monitor our website, which features our adoptable animals, and to also monitor our adoptable pet posts on our Facebook page.

            "description": "BUSTER\nMr. Buster is a 6 year old 60lbs love bug. He was taken in by a friend after his owner passed away during the pandemic. Buster loves to be around people and will follow you around the house everywhere you go. He greets you by rolling over at your feet, eagerly awaiting affection. \n\nIndoors, Buster is quiet, attentive, and when you sit still for a minute, he will prop his head on your lap for snuggles. Buster can be a bit goofy and spastic, especially when he knows he's about to go on a walk. \n\nHis ideal day would be a nice long hike with his family, followed by TV-time and a rawhide bone. He would love a family with a backyard or an area to play fetch in. He is great with children of all ages and is comfortable in his crate. Buster was first rescued a month before his human brother was born, so he is experienced with small children and infants.\n\nBuster is very strong while on leash, so owners should have experience with larger breeds. His foster home has pre-purchased a year long training program with Bark Busters to work on Buster's pulling and attentiveness outdoors. The training is transferable and his family should have time to continue it. \n\nBuster does not bark at noises or strangers, but instead he will try to communicate with you through quite adorable whimpers/groans. Buster is just a happy-go-lucky pup and with strong leadership, Buster will be one lucky family's best friend for life.\n\nTo Adopt Buster, please contact~\nInfo@AllForLoveAnimalRescue.org\n(805) 445-3535\nVentura County, CA.",

I've grown up in foster care, but it's just not the same as having my very own human to adore. I let my foster mom know when it's potty time with this cute little whiney groan. (I must have husky in my genes because sometimes I sound like I'm actually talking!) I'm respectful of assertive dogs but when paired with a more submissive dog, I will play too rough & the other dog doesn't want to play with me anymore. I can get pretty excited at play time but when it's time to go to bed, I'm quiet & calm in my kennel. I love doing zoomies; playing \"shake the toy like a ragdoll\"; & nobody knows how I learned, but I fetch, too! If I'm jumpy, just tell me to sit & I'll sit & beg for affection with my beautiful green eyes & happy smile. I absolutely love a fresh clean bed & spend time fluffing it before I curl up for a nap. Oh, and I'm very treat motivated so just wanted to make sure they're always stocked!",

            "description": "Apply at: \nheartsforpawsrescue.com/adopt\n\nMeet Angel. Angel was rescued from the Porterville shelter before coming to Hearts for Paws.\n\nHeres what her foster has to say: \n\n\u201cShe is the definition of the perfect home dog. She is more than content to sit at home with her owners on a comfy couch and cuddle all day, but she also has tons of energy and is always ready for a long walk or even a run. I have taken Angel on several 2-3 mile runs on flat pavement and she has kept up well running along at an 8 minute pace! \n\nShe doesn\u2019t seem to be interested in any balls or tugging on toys. (However, this has been great when I take her to the soccer fields because she doesn\u2019t care about the balls enough to interrupt a game.) But also means exercise is pretty much walks or runs.\n\nAngel is a quick learner and understands basic commands like sit, stop/no, and stay (when she\u2019s motivated). Angel also knows a fancy, untrained trick which is the ability to open some closed doors \u2014  this has definitely kept me on my toes at times!\n\nAngel is not interested in running away, but more determined to be with her people. I have left her home with the doors locked on one occasion and came home to find some paw marks on the inside of my front and rear door. She gets really sad when her owner leaves. Once home, she was super ecstatic and very happy to have her people back with her again. \n\nAngel loves everyone she meets (as long as they are willing to give her belly rubs), but she always listens to her owner and comes when needed. \n\nShe also really enjoys bath time, but I have yet to see how she does with larger bodies of water like a lake or the ocean. As long as she\u2019s with her owner, I\u2019m sure she\u2019d be loving it!\n\nWe know Angel used to live with another dog. On leash she doesn\u2019t lunge after other dogs or other people, but she will get excited when she sees the occasional squirrel (make sure to hold on tight for these). \n\nAngel will need to be in a pet-free home due to two separate incidences with smaller dogs. She has met and interacted with many dogs without issue, but due to the incidences will need to work on muzzle training before being reintegrated with dogs. She is not a dog park dog, but we would love for her to remain social with dogs by going on parallel walks.\n\nAngel is the perfect life partner for anyone who enjoys a lot of outdoor activity and the occasional at home day. She could be a great family dog, but she does tend to jump up when excited, so she might not be great with small kids. She loves big yards that she can run around in and loves taking a snooze on a couch or on her owner\u2019s bed.\u201d\n\n$250 adoption donation \u2014 spayed, vaccinated, microchipped, flea tick treated / dewormed.",

The home I was living in was full of dogs and we needed to relocate. A few of my friends and I made our way here to find new homes. I am fearful of new things and people, so I ask that you take it slow with me. I do warm up and am quite affectionate. I love snacks and take them so nicely. I will need a home with children over 12 years old due to my fearful behavior and sensitivities with handling. I would also appreciate a family that is a little more experienced to help me adjust nicely. I probably will take extra time to get used to a new home! I am not friendly with cats, so I would like a home without them. I do LOVE dogs and seem to come out of my shell when around them. I like to play and run around with them, so another playful canine friend would be awesome to have!\n\nMedical: Honey has 2 small bumps on the top of her head.  They were evaluated during her time at HSHA and look to be the result of an old wound/ scar tissue.  An adopter should monitor them and have them evaluated by their veterinarian if they begin to grow or change.  They may require surgical removal in the future.  An adopter will be responsible for any future medical treatment or care.",

Annie is a bit shy and timid at first, but is loving and wants to be with her person. She is a little shadow to her foster mom and follows her everywhere. Annie likes to be held, and at 14lbs, she makes a great little lap dog! Annie has a soft, velvety coat that makes it easy to give her lots of loves and pets. Annie is good in the bathtub and even getting her nails trimmed! She is crate-trained and working on her potty-training. Annie can be a bit of a picky eater. Annie lives with other dogs and a cat and gets along with them all. Annie is about 3 years young; her breed is a mystery. Annie is frightened of new people. She needs a quiet home with no children and someone willing to work with her to overcome her fears. Annie will make a great addition to the right home.

We are accepting applications for our adoptable dogs and will schedule meet and greets with approved applications. \n\nBeacher is outgoing and sweet. He'll walk up to anyone and make a new friend. Beacher is a Pomeranian mix; you can tell by both his looks and his personality. He is goofy, fun and vocal when he gets excited (so no apartments or condos for him). Beacher attaches quickly and wants to be right next to his person, which can lead to him being underfoot. Beacher is energetic and playful. He gets very excited to go on walks and is good on a leash. Beacher lives with other dogs and gets along with them, however, he does try to be the Alpha dog in his foster home. Beacher will do best with clear boundaries and rules. Beacher loves to be in a lap or next to his person. He also loves ear and belly rubs and hugs. Beacher takes treats gently and sleeps quietly in his crate at night. Beacher has a slight limp on his front left leg. It is likely an old injury. He uses his leg, puts weight on it, loves to go on long walks, play and jumps around when excited... in short, he does not appear to be in any pain and it doesn't slow him down one bit. The best way to manage it is to keep his weight down and joint support supplements. Beacher is about 6 years young and weighs 10 lbs. Beacher will be great as an only dog or with a female dog companion. Beacher needs an adult-only home. Beacher is looking for his forever buddy.

She isn\u2019t just another pretty face, she\u2019s got the brains behind those eyes to back her up! She enjoys a challenge and is always ready to learn something new.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nRosie is an active lady, not overly so, just the right amount to enjoy a home that likes to play with her, let her do zoomies in the back yard or go on lots of walks! She\u2019s extremely athletic and with the smarts to figure out how to jump on the counter if given the opportunity! A good sized, fenced yard is necessary or an exercise regimen that would include some running every day.\u00a0\n\nRosie needs a strong alpha human to keep her in line, and preferably a larger alpha dog to play with as she\u2019s rather bossy with dogs her size or smaller! She is very protective and possessive of her human\u2019s, her pack leader will need to ensure she knows that it isn\u2019t her job to guard!\n\nShe is an excellent watchdog, always on the alert, and will let you know when someone is encroaching on her home. Rosie is house trained, knows some basic commands and comes when called. She does well in a crate, sleeps in bed all night and wakes up happy and ready to start the day.\u00a0\n\nShe is UTD on shots, on HW preventative, and spayed.Her adoption donation is $250.00.\n\nIf you are interested in the above dog, please do not email us and tell us that you are interested, but submit an adoption application. The link for the application is below.\n\nTo submit an application go here\u2026\u2026chihuahua-rescue.com/adoption-application/An application must be submitted and approved before a meet-n-greet can be scheduled.\n\nYour current dogs/cats must be spayed or neutered unless a veterinarian has determined that your current pet(s) should not be fixed due to medical reasons. They must also be up-to-date on shots and on HW preventative.\n\nReference checks and a home visit are required so SE dogs can only be adopted in NC/SC, VA MD and GA.",

Their staff and volunteers, with the extra help of our Handsome Dan's Rescue volunteers, are trying to help him get through his temporary situation. He really needs a special person who is willing to teach him that he is safe and loved. Baloo has some anxiety issues he is working through. The abrupt change from being owned to shelter life has been difficult for him.\n\nBaloo is a big guy at 92lbs. He needs to lose a few pounds to be at his optimal weight. \n\nBaloo has been granted a Handsome Dan's Rescue Take My Lead grant for up $300 - $500 of FREE training with one of our partner trainers!\n\nBaloo is a very special guy.

            "description": "Jarvis is a great Boxer mix and really sweet. He came into the shelter as a lost dog on Dec. 15, and the officer who picked him up as he roamed the neighborhood knew where he lived and thought his family would come for him, but they have not. He is a really good boy and can't understand why he's in the loud shelter. Jarvis is about 3 years old and weighs 68 pounds. He is up-to-date on vaccinations, now neutered and will microchipped upon adoption. Sadly he has tested positive for heartworms but with treatment he should be good as new in no time. Please speak to your veterinarian regarding treatment options. Come meet him in Run 87 using ID#626491.\n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information. Shelter hours are: Tues. - Sun. 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. by appointment only until further notice, CLOSED Mondays & Holidays.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\n\nMelvin makes his foster home a merry home. The 5-year-old former stray packs his solid 70-pound frame full of happiness, playfulness and loving, and counts cuddling with his foster mom as one of his preferred pastimes. Add his favorite snacks, from chicken jerky to pupperoni dog treats, to the mix when they're watching TV and he's in doggy heaven. He gets along easily with other dogs and although he likes toys, he's not passionate about them, but he does enjoy going for walks and runs, walking well on his leash and responding quickly to corrections - with the help of some treats -- if he gets too rambunctious. On his best behavior inside, he sits politely, takes food gently, eats heartily, free roams with a Kong for company when his foster mom is out and is fully housetrained. Now all Melvin needs is a home with a securely fenced yard or one with an active family to keep him well loved and well exercised fur-ever.\n\nAnimal Rescue of the Rockies believes that every pet should find a wonderful, caring home. To ensure each pet finds the best possible home, we ask that you fill out our Adoption Application so we can learn more about you and your household. We review each application we receive and will contact you within 48 hours. If your home sounds like a good match for you and the pet,\n\nthe next step is to set up a \"meet and greet.\" After meeting the pet, if you would like to proceed with adopting, we'll ask that you read and sign our Adoption Agreement and pay the adoption fee. Our adoption fees help cover the costs of saving more lives!\n\nA home visit will be scheduled within one week of your new pet going home with you.\n\nThe adoption fee for this pet is $300. Our adoption fee covers the following:\n\n- Spay/Neuter, Microchip\n\n- DAPP vaccinations as age appropriate for dog - adopter shall be responsible for all DAPP boosters after adoption.\n\n- Rabies vaccinations as age appropriate for dog - adopter shall be responsible for any rabies vaccinations after adoption.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out an adoption application by clicking\n\nhere\n\n.\n\nWe want our pets to go to a lifelong new home, so thank you for your patience during the adoption process!\n\nPlease email ARRColorado@gmail.com for more information, as we can not accept calls at this time.\n\nOur adoption process is:\n\n1. Fill out our Adoption Application online. We'll contact you within 48 hours to answer any questions you may have about the pet.\n\n2. If the pet looks like a great match, we'll schedule a meet and greet and ask you to fill out our online Adoption Agreement if you'd like to proceed with adopting. Once you've completed the Adoption Agreement and pay the pet's Adoption Fee, you can arrange to pick up your new furry family member!",

Please visit http://www.caninelifeline.org/adoption-process/ for more information about our adoption process and to submit an online application.\n\nRachel is an adorable 1 year-old Retriever mix girl who came into an overcrowded rural county dog shelter along with her siblings, Lacy and Chuckles. We have no history on their pre-shelter life but the pups were very frightened at the shelter so made the trip to Canine Lifeline so they could relax in a foster home while searching for permanent new homes. Rachel is the shyest of the three and after two weeks with us, is still hesitant to let her guard down and trust new people. She loves other dogs so definitely needs a home with a canine buddy who can show her the ropes and help boost her confidence in new situations. Rachel also needs a home in quiet neighborhood or rural area as a busy urban or bustling high-density suburban neighborhood would be very frightening for her. Given her skittishness, she needs to have a yard with a secure aboveground fence to keep her safe at home. Rachel has been working on walking on a leash but is still not comfortable with that. She flattens to the ground but having a canine buddy to walk with will definitely help her realize that going for a walk is lots of fun. Rachel and her siblings likely lived their lives outdoors before coming to the shelter so all aspects of indoor life have been new to Rachel. She has been working on crate-training and housetraining in her foster home and will need to continue both in her new home. Rachel is going to need a very kind and patient person or family to give her the time and space she needs to be comfortable in her new surroundings. While there doesn't seem to be a mean bone in her body, it is going to take awhile for her to trust people and that is something that can't be rushed. Rachel weighs about 31 pounds and her adoption fee is $350. She's spayed, heartworm negative and on monthly preventative, up to date on vaccinations including bivalent canine influenza, wormed, on flea and tick preventative, and microchipped. As part of the adoption process, all adopters must commit to a two-week adjustment period to make sure it's a great match before the adoption is finalized. Please email info@caninelifeline.org if you're interested in Rachel. An approved application is required before we schedule meets with any of our dogs. Please note that we don't place our dogs in homes with children under 7 years of age. We correspond via email so please check your junkmail or spam folder to make sure our reply hasn't landed in there. Please visit our website at www.caninelifeline.org to see more photos of Rachel and to submit an online application if you live in Northeast OH.",

She was recently rescued and the vet wants to wait to be spayed until she gets a 2nd vaccine - therefore, there will be an Adoption Agreement that they must get spay/neuter at the age of 6 months old the latest\n\nReady to give her a forever home? Please follow the instructions and start with completing an application at the following link: http://aaofus.org/adoption-application.html\n\nWe are scheduling meet & greet adoption appointments and keeping a distance protocol. No appointments will be made unless we have received an application; therefore, we can match you with the best fit for you. In addition, to keep you safe and healthy as well as our pups that don't need to be handle by too many people. Appointments are scheduled late afternoons.\n\nPlease text at 619-576-0747 or email veronica.aaofusa@gmail.com or visit our website at www.aaofus.org and complete our application at the following link:\nhttp://aaofus.org/adoption-application.html\n\nDue to high volume of calls; NO PHONE calls are accepted at this time - therefore, please text us or email us.\n\nLIVE!! LOVE!!! RESCUE!! ADOPT A HOMELESS PET AND SAVE A LIFE!!!\n\nFollow us on Instagram @aaofus",

He weighs in at 83 pounds of pure love and is estimated to be just a year old.  In one of the pictures he looks as if he is growling but really he is trying to smile! UPDATE: He does not know what toys are and although he is learning about the leash does pretty well. Doesn't pull just is confused about what is expected. He will jump on you but with proper training he will be an amazing dog. His jumping is getting better as the three have been separated but he is still more energetic than Reggie and will take some patience to train, with regular routine Bunk will be an excellent buddy. He also take treats very gentle. \nBunk's adoption fee will be $100 and includes current vaccinations, neuter and he is heartworm negative.",

            "description": "Meera is a 10ish year old small pit mix girl. She came to us the day she was scheduled to be euthanized at an overcrowded shelter in Kansas. We were able to get her tumor biopsied and discovered that while it is cancer, it is also low grade so she was given a 3 year prognosis -- which is great news. She needs to go through heartworm treatment and be spayed, but you wouldn't know she had dealt with any hardships at all with her amazing personality! She adores all people and does okay with most dogs. She can be sassy with some at first but redirects well, so would need to meet any other animals in her home. Meera thinks couches and dog beds are the bee's knees and just wants a place to lay her head and get lots of attention in her retirement years. If you're interested in giving this sweet girl a loving home, please put in an adoption application at www.foreverhomedogs.org!All adoptions are $200 per dog which include spay/neuter, micro-chipped and up-to-date on required shots. \n\nSenior dogs, at our discretion, are adopted out at $100 per dog because we know they will have less time with your family and may eventually have more needs as they get older. But we feel these dogs deserve to live out the rest of their lives as part of a loving family.",

Sadly, we are no longer able to respond to every application, but will contact the one that is a good match within 3 days.\nMr Bean is a male 6-7 yr old chihuahua, a middle aged ittle boy.  He is loving, social and super cute but he does also have a mind of his own and likes to be the boss.   Mr. Bean is just under 8 lbs.  He loves strutting around like a much bigger dog.  He is ok with non-bossy male dogs as he can be pretty bossy himself, female dogs would be best.  He is food possessive, so no small children please.    Mr Bean has a heart murmur, he is not on any medication and it does not bother him one bit, but its hard to predict what the future holds.    He also has some disk issues on his back, since we dont know anything about his past we dont know when it happened but we do know that he is painful at times and to keep pain to a minimal we do have to keep him at a good weight (he cant get too heavy). \nMost of our dogs are not available to an out of the area adoption because of difficulty to follow up.  If you do not live within a 2 hr drive of Orange County, please email us before applying to see if the dog you are interested is may be a candidate for long distance adoption.    We only make consider long distance adoptions for dogs who have been in our rescue for 6 plus months with no local candidates.\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our rescues, please visit our main website for adoption procedures at www.pupsandpals.net and then fill out our application.  Please note that we are all volunteers so it may take up to 3 days to process your application, but you will hear back from us if your application is a good match for the pet. \nWe do not have a shelter so individual appointments must be made to meet the pet you are interested in.  Our pets are fostered/boarded all over LA and Orange County.  \nThis pet is altered, vaccinated, microchipped, and has had a brief temperament evaluation to help us determine what type of  a home he/she would thrive in.  Please note that we put lots of time and effort to make sure our pets are ready to be someone's perfect pet before they go home.... and to make sure that we will have the best possible match for this pet we do require an : application, interview, adoption fee and in some case a home check.  \nListed for adoption: 1/1/2021\nAdoption fee: $250\nPLEASE DO NOT call or email to see if a pet is available.  We update our pages daily so if he/she is pictured here in the available dogs section, we are accepting applications at this time.",

Now, with all the love she\u2019s received from the volunteers, she has been opening up and showing her playful, silly side. Holly would love to go to a home where she is given time to adjust and learn that new things aren\u2019t scary. She has gained so much confidence in her short time at LaMancha! She will truly blossom in her own home. Holly would do best in home with a quieter environment, because she is learning how to be a treasured dog, and not just a dog nobody cared about before rescue saved her life. Holly is looking for a family to help her gain her confidence and learn what it means to be loved. \n\nIf you have already fallen in love with Holly and can\u2019t wait to meet her, please email Rescue@LamanchaAnimalRescue.org and subject line: Holly\n\n\nSpayed, UTD vaccinations, microchipped, wormed.\n\nHousetrained.\n\n",

Prospective adopters must be able to travel to San Antonio to complete the adoption process. Please apply online at http://texasgreatdane.org/adoption-application/ **\nChilo is a handsome 8-month-old Hound blend. He was found as a stray in a small town in Mexico where he faced a sad life of starvation and abuse. A Good Samaritan in that area stepped in to change his fate and contacted our rescue for assistance. Chilo was immediately transported to Texas and hospitalized because he had contracted both distemper and parvo. He beat the odds by surviving two deadly diseases. As a result of the distemper, Chilo does have a minor neurological twitch that does not impact his daily activity level. Chilo also did test positive for ehrlichia which is a bacteria infection caused by a tick bite and he is completing a 30-day course of doxycycline. Chilo is initially shy but once you offer him treats, he quickly displays his affectionate and loyal nature. He is an active and playful boy but will need leash training. His ideal owner would lead an active lifestyle and include Chilo in daily walks, hikes, etc.\nPlease understand you are committing to providing a good home for his entire life (up to 15+ years or more.)\nYou must be committed to housebreaking, age-appropriate enrichment and exercise, leash training, grooming needs, and positive socialization.\nHis adoption fee is $175. This includes his neuter surgery, rabies vaccination, Nobivac Canine 1-DAPP vaccination, Nobivac Intra-Trac 3 vaccination, Drontal Plus, IDEXX SNAP 4Dx Plus Test, Tri-Heart Plus chewable tablet, 24PetWatch microchip, leash and collar, and a trial offer for 24PetWatch Pet Insurance.\nPlease be aware that puppies and small breed dogs do get adopted quickly so interested parties are encouraged to apply online at www.saspca.org.\nPlease ensure your application is complete before submitting.

He is very exubarent and will need a strong handler for him to learn his manners and obedience. We strongly recommend upon adoption that he start structured obedience training to insure a succesful adoption. Boomer should go to a home with teens and up because of his strong willed nature. He has also shown us that he should be the only dog in the household since he can be a bit too pushy with other dogs. Boomer would make an excellent work out buddy for runs and hiking, this would help him release all the energy he has to give.",

In the home, Boxer prefers to have only one owner, as he bonds tightly to one person and does not always enjoy sharing his people. \n\nBoxer is looking for a home where he can be your one and only.

            "description": "http://www.wagsandwhiskerspetrescue.com/adopt.html\n\nMeet Juno! Our 10 year old pit bull mix that we received on December 23rd of 2020. When we first got Juno from Bakersfield we could tell she was going to need lots of medical attention. Despite the fact that she walked with a slight limp, the thing that caught our attention the most was the large masses hanging from her body; one on the chest, one in the middle of her abdomen, and another one hanging off her nipple on the back right side. She has a couple other battle scars and struggles with stairs due to arthritis but that sure doesn't stop her. Juno has a very young soul and loves to play, especially with other dogs. When we received her, she was being housed with a smaller scruffy dog but he got adopted rather quickly, leaving her to anxiously wait for her forever family to come and find her. Next week she is scheduled for surgery, dental cleaning and bloodwork, she would love to be able to heal in a comforting home! If you're interested in meeting the lovely Juno to adopt or foster, submit an online application and we will get back to you ASAP, she'll be waiting!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this pet please apply to adopt at\nhttp://www.wagsandwhiskerspetrescue.com/adopt.html\nif the pet is still available for adoption and you are approved to adopt we will contact you to set up a meet and greet appointment.",

            "description": "Wile E. Coyote is a German Shepherd with a ton of personality - we call him \u2018Wiley\u2019 and he\u2019s been an awesome addition to his foster family\u2019s pack. Wiley is about 2.5- 3 years old and weighsin at 80 pounds. He ended up at the shelter as a stray and his family chose not to reclaim him. Wiley has adjusted well to living with a female GSD in his foster home. He is incredibly sweet and loves to meet people. Wiley doesn\u2019t show any sort of negative reaction to new people or dogs. He is incredibly smart and knows basic commands well. He knows sit, stay, shake, down and drop it. Like other dogs, he can get very excited and has a tendency to jump during his excitement but he\u2019s getting better. He\u2019s been working to stay down when he meets people as he\u2019s quite tall! He has not been placed in a crate during his foster time and has done quite well free roaming the house. He\u2019s been allowed on furniture and the bed in the house so will need to be trained if his forever home does not want him on furniture. Wiley loves walks, fuzzy toys and can play with sticks/fetch forever. Like most GSDs, he will need a lot of exercise and mental stimulation. While he was anxious and fearful at the beginning, Wiley has become a very gentle dog in his few weeks in a good family environment. He hasn\u2019t had much experience being left alone but has shown no signs of being destructive. \n\nFinally, Wiley has hip dysplasia in his left hip. He has a tendency to be sore after intense playing and doesn\u2019t like to be touched on his back legs or tail. He has been prescribed pain killers as needed - he was evaluated and does not require surgery. He will need to be kept on joint supplements and at a lean weight. His foster parents have worked extensively with him on familiarizing Wiley with positive touch. Wiley can be reactive with his mouth - he\u2019s very particular about how much time you spend petting him and will growl at you or show his teeth if he doesn\u2019t want you touching him. He immediately stops after you pull your hand away but he will use his teeth to nip you if he\u2019s uncomfortable with any touch he doesn\u2019t like. Small children might not do well with Wiley as kids will need to know when to stop touching Wiley and how to be respectful of a big dog\u2019s space. \n\nOverall, Wiley is an incredible dog and will make a great companion. He will require consistent attention, as most GSDs do, but he will quickly become a member of your pack.  He makes hilarious noises, loves to \u2018sing\u2019 with ambulances, is a big cuddler, and loves to sit on your feet. His foster family loves him dearly and is excited for his goofy self to find an incredible forever home for him. \n\nAdoption fee includes: spay or neuter, all routine vaccines, heart worm testing, fecal test and microchip.\n\nMany questions can be answered by going to www.gsrescue1.org",

            "description": "Scroll down to learn more about this pet:\n\n***\nBichon and Little Buddies is open only\n\nby appointment with a completed application.\nDogs in foster homes require an appointment and approved application to meet. The application is online at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog If a dog is listed as available, then we are still taking applications - no need to email or call to ask about the status. Note: The forms that Petfinder or Adopt-a-pet has to inquire about the dog is not our application application. Our form must be filled out to be approved to adopt a pet.***\n\nCovid-19 Precautions:\n\nUntil further notice, Bichon & Little Buddies will be doing all meets and adoptions by appointment only. To be able to control the number of people at the shelter at one time, we will be suspending our open hours on Thursdays. If interested in adopting, please fill out the pre-adoption application and we will set up a time for you to come meet the dogs you are interested in.\n\nAbout this Dog:\n\nName: Girlie\n\nBreed: Chihuahua type mix\n\nApproximate Age: 8-10 yr\n\nGender: Female\n\nWeight: 14 lb\n\nAdoption Fee: $250\n\nWhy in Rescue: Texas Transfer\n\nGeneral Profile: Please fill out the adoption application at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog if you are interested in meeting one of our dogs.\n\nGirlie is a quiet old girl who made the long trip from Texas after her owner died and the family members weren't able to keep her. We are estimating her to be between 8-10 years old. We had her teeth cleaned, and are treating an ulcer on her eye. She does have a heart murmur, so that needs to be monitored to see if she would benefit from medication in the future. At this time she doesn't show any signs of heart failure. We don't know if she lived with children, but there were other small dogs in the house so she may do fine with other dogs. We don't know if she is housetrained. If interested in adopting this older girl, please fill out the pre-adoption application.\n\nWe do our best to evaluate the dogs while they are with us, but they sometimes act different in the shelter environment than they do in a home. If you are interested in any of our dogs, please fill out the pre-adoption application and we will set up a time for you to come and meet them.\n\nIf considering adopting a former breeding dog, the following article is good to read to help you understand the special needs these dogs may have. http://www.nowisconsinpuppymills.com/mill-survivors.html\n\nAdoption Procedures:\n\n1. Completely fill out the pre-adoption application at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog. We will be checking with your vet if you have had pets, calling your landlord (if any) and checking a personal reference, before we contact you about visiting the adoptables. Any missing information may have us moving onto another application.\n\n2. If you application is approved, we will contact you to come meet the adoptables that you are interested in.\n\n3. If it is a match, you will complete the adoption contract and pay the adoption fee. Please be prepared to take your adopted pet home when you come meet him/her. In most cases, you will be able to take the pet home the same day. If all the vetting hasn't been done yet, we will hold the pet for you until the vet work is completed.\n\n4. If you have filled out an application and we haven't contacted you within a week, we may have missed your application, the pet may have been adopted by another applicant, or you may have been missing information on your application. You may contact us to find out the status of your application at this time. Please give us a week to process your application before contacting us!\n\nThe adoption fee through Bichon and Little Buddies Rescue is $200 - $475 depending on the age of the dog, which includes Wi State Sales Tax. Included in this fee is your new companion who will be spayed/neutered, have a current Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (as required by state law), current on age appropriate vaccinations, heartworm tested and started on preventative, microchipped, and dewormed. Other medical needs will also have been taken care of, such as dentals and treating ear infections.\n\nTo assist you and your new pet in adjusting to life together, you will also receive an 8 week age appropriate obedience training course at For Pet's Sake Dog Training for $50 (up to $200 value). You may opt to take Puppy Kindergarten, Adult Beginners, Small Dogs Big Hearts, or Shy & Reactive Dog Class. You must start the class within 90 days of adoption for the reduced fee. For more information on the classes visit www.forpetssake.cc\n\nAll dogs are seen BY APPOINTMENT ONLY. Many are in various foster homes getting extra one on one attention getting them ready for their new homes. The first step in adoption is filling out the pre-adoption application. Bichon and Little Buddies is run by volunteers who have full time jobs in addition to the hours they spend with the rescue dogs. Having an application on file assures us that the potential adopter is really interested in adopting a dog. It also assists us in placing dogs in homes where both the dog and new owners are happy. The application puts you under no obligation to adopt a dog from Bichon and Little Buddies.\n\nThe Dog Pre-Adoption Application can be found at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog\n\nThanks for thinking about adopting your new pet!More important information:\n\n***We are a Wisconsin based rescue and do not ship our pets. If you are considering adoption you must be willing to drive to meet and adopt the pet, as well as bring the pet back to us if the adoption doesn't work. We adopt primarily in WI and IL, but will consider applicants in MN, IA, and MI.***\n\n***Please do not set up an appointment to meet the animals until you are ready to take your pet home. If the meeting results in a match, you can often take the dog/cat home the same day or within a couple days if the medical care hasn't been completed. We are not able to hold pets for adopters beyond this time. Thanks for understanding.***\n\n***While we hope all of our adoptions lead to permanent homes for the animals we place, sometimes things just don't work out. We do have a 30 day trial period. For the first 30 days, if you or Bichon and Little Buddies decide that the adoption isn't a good match for either the humans or the pet, the adoption fee will be refunded minus $50 within 30 days of the return of the dog. Bichon and Little Buddies also requires adopters to return the pet to us at any time that they are unable or unwilling to care for the animal anymore.***\n\n***We do not show dogs/cats without an appointment. The first step in adoption is filling out the pre-adoption application at http://www.bichonrescues.com/pre-adoption-form-dog Please do not call/email until AFTER you have filled out an application.***\n\nBichon and Little Buddies is a State Licensed Rescue # 268555-DS",

She is a gentle soul, affectionate, and bonds deeply with her human, however she is extremely skittish and takes awhile to warm up.  Once she lets you in she is very loving and sweet. \n\nShe is looking for a forever home that is quiet, patient, and overwhelmingly positive.  She is fearful and will need to be given a lot of time to decompress and get settled in her home and new routine.  A home with experience in working with a rescue dog is preferred.  She is ok with other dogs, and looks to them for guidance, but could also be the only dog in the home.  \n\nSalsa would prefer to be in a home without children or cats.  She would love to have her own fenced in yard, where she can go in and out of the house as she pleases.  This sweet girl deserves to have the best life!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, and would like to make an appointment for a meet and greet, please fill out and submit our Canine Adoption Application on our website:\n\nhttps://www.apsfh.com/adoption-program/canine-application/\n\nCOVID-19: Due to the ongoing pandemic, APS-FH will be giving priority to local adopters, however an application must be submitted prior to any meet and greets.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.OUR REQUIREMENTS FOR PUPPY ADOPTION:\n1) PUPPIES WILL ONLY BE PLACED IN HOMES WITH YOUTHFUL, PLAYFUL, DOGS. This helps integrate the dog into your household easier by giving the pup a mentor.\n2) In addition to the youthful playful dog, someone MUST also be home at least part of the day. Please do not apply for a puppy if you are gone 8-10 hours a day. It is not a good situation for you or the puppy.\n3) You must have plans in place to socialize your puppy properly.\n4) Our puppies are not livestock dogs. They must be family pets that are allowed inside the home.\n\nPlease watch this short video which demonstrates how puppies learn polite behavior from their adult dog mentors. https://youtu.be/R6N8STRl2aI\n\nMeet Levi! This handsome little cutie is a hoot!\n\nWatch him determinedly splash and bite water out of his big water bowl! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCCQsGWF9P8\n\nAnd this video shows when he first arrived to his foster home, and he adorable gets used to being the focus of paparazzi. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2a-URjcw58\n\nLevi is a fine-boned puppy who weighed about 50 pounds at seven months of age. His ideal adult weight is likely around 75 pounds.\n\nAlthough the shelter put his birthdate at March 2020, all indications are that he is a little younger than that, born closer to May 2020.\n\nLittle Levi loves to play! He gets along easily with the other big dogs in his foster home. He likes them all! He has a blast romping and wrestling with them. He must have at least one large, playful doggie companion in his forever home. If you don't already have a suitable fur buddy for him, adopt one from us!\n\nAt this young age, Levi is really energetic. He can be rambunctious at times. For this reason, any children in the home should be older than age seven or so.\n\nLevi is totally house trained. He can be crated, but it is not needed. He goes in easily when you just put him in, close the door, and say \"we're done.\"\n\nHe is polite on leash and needs a little more practice to perfect his technique. He rides happily in a car.\n\nHe is a \"landscaper!\" He will dig a crater in your yard to lay in.\n\nLittle Levi is such a delightful, sweet dog. He will be a great forever companion for the right family.\n\nSPIN Pyrs are all in foster homes in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. Potential adopters are asked to make travel arrangements if they live elsewhere. All SPIN dogs are spayed or neutered, current on vaccinations and on heartworm prevention. Please go to our website www.SpinRescue.org and fill out an application for this great Great Pyrenees!",

(Listen carefully and you might hear him sing \"You've Got a Friend in Me\"). While walking on leash, he stops and waits for your cue to cross the street. As a top notch astronaut, Buzz would love to continue his training to keep his skills sharp. He enjoys exploring faraway galaxies, but will settle for keeping things local with you. If you forgot your spacesuit, Buzz is happy to hop in your car to get around. He needs to be the only space ranger in the home, but Buzz will always watch your back and drop his macho act enough to let you sneak in a few face kisses. If you are looking for a hero, this your guy! Buzz hopes you will be the one to take him home, to infinity and beyond!",

See the bottom of this bio for more FAQs regarding our adoption process before emailing.****\n\nName: Silvia aka Tatum\n\nAge: approximately 1-2years old\n\nWeight: 70 pounds\n\n*Adoption Fee: $375.00\n\n*Health: up to date on Vaccines, spayed, microchipped\n\nMEET SILVIA:\nShe is the Total Package ! She loves going for Long Walks, Snuggling on The Couch, Staring Deep into Your Eyes & giving Big Bear Hugs ! \nThis sweet girl loves to learn. Tatum will require some basic training she also has some slight separation anxiety so she will need a family that is willing to take the time and help her understand it\u2019s okay to be alone sometimes. Tatum will do best in a home with a large yard so that she can have plenty of space to run and play. She would love a family that is active and want a buddy for adventures. Tatum gets along well with relaxed dogs that will not overwhelm her. \n\nTo apply to adopt Tatum , fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES: $495 for puppies / $375 for adults. Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n\n",

I later asked his name and told Lucas. I asked more information and what I didn't know is that this sweet face was rescued by us from being euthanized just a few days ago. Could you imagine not being able to see this smile again? He has no idea. Lucas did no wrong. I wish we could rescue them all. For now, I'm grateful we were able to see this face and provide you with a sweetheart so happy at a second chance in life and thankful for a shelter that I am part of who rescued him. For now, he will receive plenty of love, exercise and a chance at being loved and rehomed from one of you wonderful adopters. From me, he will receive more of my breakfast sandwiches and eventually some holiday flare if someone doesn't swoop him up quickly. I am proud to be part of it all. He does need to be only pet.",

Some were dumped, abandoned in an empty house, left tied to a tree, picked up by animal control as strays, or simply unwanted by their owners. We ask that only serious and committed adopters apply as these dogs have suffered enough.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this pet please apply to adopt at\nhttp://www.wagsandwhiskerspetrescue.com/adopt.html\nif the pet is still available for adoption and you are approved to adopt we will contact you.\n\nCalling and checking the status of your application will not increase your chances of adoption",

            "description": "If you are interested in adopting Spicy, please email meganniewold@gmail.com\n\nDo you scroll past the puppies and yearn for a dog who already knows the basics like how to potty outside and not to pull on a leash? Do you want to go the extra mile with training and help a dog learn to trust strangers and be less protective of her loved ones? That's what Spicy wants to learn because she has the basics down pact! Spicy knows how to sit, stay, come, lay down, she's potty trained, she walks well on a leash, ignores people and dogs on walks, and knows \"down! when she gets jumpy. She's as smart as they come-but we won't lie to you, Spicy is looking for the right kind of forever home. \n\n\n\nSpicy is a four-year old, 40 pound, boxer mix! She has big paws and a big head to match her giant personality! \n\n\n\nSpicy can be fearful of new people and new situations but her foster family is setting her up with the right training to give her the confidence to meet new strangers with confidence. Since being in her foster home, Spicy has blossomed into the sweetest dog her foster family has ever had (don't tell their resident dog!) \n\nShe has grown to love both her foster mom and foster dad as well as her foster dog-brother. Spicy's current home doesn't have kids but Spicy has been tested with kids and loves them; We recommend 15+ household for Spicy as she learns to accept new people into the house. She loves to go on long walks around the neighborhood and play chase with her foster-dog brother in the backyard. Her foster mom thinks she would do best as the only dog in the home because although Spicy is dog-friendly, she can be somewhat toy and food possessive. Right now, Spicy goes on three long walks a day and still gets the zoomies-so she needs an active household who can take her on lots of long walks, skipping the dog park, since she can be finicky toward certain people. \n\nSpicy will need continued training to teach her that the people who come into her new family's home are friends and should be trusted and not feared. Her foster family has been working on this and have had success-Spicy is smart and can definitely be trained! \n\nFinally, Spicy's foster mom and dad want her potential family to know that the work you put into Spicy will come back to you in so much love. She loves her people hard and is the sweetest, silliest little girl that will be the best dog a family could want! Oh yeah, did we mention she LOVES bath time? \n\nSponsored by Brian, Stephanie, & Winston (fka Tux)",

In early December, he was hit by a car and stabilized at an emergency vet before being transferred to PACC. Hes been a model patient in the PACC clinic, where hes undergone surgery and all of the poking and prodding that goes along with it. Hes made great progress, but its time for him to find a committed foster or adopter to help him continue the healing process outside of the shelter. Angus isnt asking for much- in fact, rest is the main prescription from the clinic vets. No long walks or rowdy shenanigans for this guy! If you have a calm, quiet home where Angus can relax and continue to heal, please ask about helping him today!",

            "description": "Buddy T. is a 10-year-old male German Shepherd Dog who was found stray in Southern California. He was covered in dirt, starving and had open sores on his ears. Shelter staff found him to be a social boy who was very eager for human attention. Buddy walked past the many stressed and barking dogs in the shelter, remaining focused on the people around him. Buddy had an accident at some point, resulting in a shortened tail that he was wagging in circles to show how appreciative he was of receiving love and medical treatment. TSGSR staff visited Buddy and found a gentle giant with a big personality. Buddy is now being cared for by TSGSR volunteers at Thulani Central. He rides well in the car, gets along with other dogs and is good with middle school aged children as well as adults. He has leash manners and obeys basic commands. Thulani volunteers all love to walk and brush Buddy! He has a personality that pulls people in and makes them smile. He will make a wonderful addition to a family with love to share.\n\nBuddy T. Summary:\n- Buddy is a neutered male, 10 yrs old, weighs 71 lbs, current on shots\n- Good with Adults, middle school aged children, dogs, and travel in the car\n- Young Children and cats TBD\n\nBuddy passed a set of evaluation tests before being accepted into the TSGSR. The tests are not intended to assess how smart the dog is but are important for TSGSR to determine if the dog is expected to be safe in a family home. The tested behaviors check to see if the dog will guard or protect food or toys from people, will tolerate handling all over its body (including ears, nose, lips to check teeth, lifting paws, belly, back, and gently pulling the tail) and the ability to get along with other well behaved dogs. He remained calm during all of these tests and showed no aggressive tendencies. \n\nPlease join us in welcoming Buddy to TSGSR! Check back often. We will be updating his bio as we learn more about him!\n\nWhat's Next for Buddy T.:\nThulani Senior German Shepherd Rescue (TSGSR) will continue to see that Buddy is well cared for and receives all medical care needed for his well being while in our care. In addition, TSGSR is beginning a search for an adoptive home that will care for him for the rest of his life. He will come to his new home with a supply of food, a cushy pad if wanted, and other goodies such as toys. \n\nBuddys medical expenses will be covered for the rest of his life by Thulani Senior German Shepherd Rescue (TSGSR)!\n\nIf you want to learn more about Buddy, or are interested in possibly providing an adoptive or foster home, please send us a message by clicking on the \"Ask About Me\" button. We will often get feedback or \"updates\" from a dog's foster home and as any updates become available they will be included here.\n\nIf you are reading about him on Petfinder.com sometimes an available YouTube video is not listed. If this occurs you can still view the video by pasting its URL into a new browser window or tab.\n\nAvailable Video URL(s): https://youtu.be/0sYT1Zx8pQ8\n\nSaving one dog wont change the world. It will change the world for that one dog.",

He loves companionship and is happy to play with stuffed toys, zoom around the yard, or just get couch cuddles while you binge The Bachelorette. Freckles is very treat motivated and has many tricks in his repertoire already and is eager to learn even more! Check out the videos in his profile to see him in action. If you're ready to give all your love to one 'n only - then Freckles is your guy!\n\nHis adoption fee is now sponsored due to a generous donation from one of his fans, and he is neutered, vaccinated, heartworm negative and microchipped. \n\n**Due to COVID, we are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications.

Although Gia is still young, she is a mature and well-mannered girl. Over the holidays, she is committed to working on her basic cues and perfecting her leash manners, in preparation for her furever family. Like many of our pyrs, Gia is wary when people approach her quickly without warning, and/or with loud noises. However, once she bonds with you, she transforms into the most attentive and loyal companion. Gia prefers to hang out with dogs of similar size, but she is also quite content with being by herself. She is playful at times, and is also perfectly happy to chill and take it easy. Gia will do well in a relatively quiet home where her people will spend the time to get to know her, and help her get settled into her new environment. If you are willing to let Gia into your heart, she will no doubt be your most loyal companion!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nNGPR dogs are in foster homes throughout the U.S., NOT Beacon, NY. View full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.\n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

I came from Virginia and i was surrendered to the animal Control because i have a bite history that had to do with protecting and size. I was transferred to my rescue for training and rehabilitation so although i am not quite available yet until after my rehabilitation and assessment is done, i am just letting you know that i am looking for my forever home, probably best with another big dog and lots of running space with great dane knowledge. I love children and am housebroken. My rescue tells me that i am going to go to a home that is very selective for a right fit, meet and greets can be scheduled with my trainer.",

Please submit an application and we will link you up for an intro!\n\nBarnabus is eligible for a foster-to-adopt period.\n\nAge: ~ 1.5 years\nWeight: ~ 50 lbs\nHousebroken: Yes\nCrate Trained: Yes, but takes some time to settle\nDog Sociability: Not a match, leash reactive (barks/lunges at other dogs on walks)\nCat Sociability: Not a match\nKid Compatibility: May do well with kids 12+. Too rowdy for littles. \nIdeal Living Situation: Barnabus would love an active adopter excited about training! He requires a yard in his forever home to set him up for success.\n\nBarnabus is so much fun! This guy is wicked smart and loves to engage his brain with enrichment toys and training. He has picked up on several tricks like sit, down, shake, and \"puppy pushups\". He will do almost anything for a piece of hot dog! He loves to play and is a bit clumsy and might run into tables and doors when he is not paying attention. Barnabus has some energy to burn and would love a yard to run around in. He loves to cuddle, so we hope you like to share the couch! This guy is so great and will be your BFF in no time.\n\nBarnabus' adoption fee is sponsored thanks to a generous donor! He is neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, and heartworm negative.\n\n***Please Note: We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications. We ask that you please be patient and someone will be in touch via email within 72 hours. Please do not email us unless you have not received a response in 72 hours. Please only fill out one adoption application.***",

Submit an application from our website and then make an appointment to meet him.\n\nBubba is not eligible for foster and will be a straight adoption.\n\nAge: ~5 years\nWeight: ~72lbs\nHousebroken: Yes\nCrate trained: Takes time to settle in his crate (10-30 minutes). Has done well with free roam while his fosters have been away.\nDog sociability: Leash reactive/frustrated. Barks, lunges at other dogs on leash. \nCat sociability: Not a match\nKids: Not a match\nIdeal home: Big Bubba is looking for a quiet neighborhood without a ton of foot traffic. He is a big boy that will do best with a confident handler. He takes time to warm up to strangers and would love a patient adopter with a fridge full of snacks :)\n\nBig Bubba is gentleman looking for a lap to sleep in forever. He is 90% head and 10% body. He is an angel in the house--he asks permission to get onto the furniture for his snuggles, he is potty trained, and he doesn't even sniff the trash. He knows a plethora of fun tricks, including sit, stay, shake, and roll over! Bubba is not sure yet about city life, and would love to be an only dog for now. He will require a confident handler who is willing to work with him on his leash reactivity and pulling and some stranger danger. We think he could also love having a yard to sniff around--he sniffs like a cartoon dog! He would love nothing more than to sit in your lap all day, or snooze tucked into his bed with a blanket next to you. \n\nBubba's adoption fee is 300. He is netuered, up to date on core vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative.\n\n***We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications.

He's tall and lanky. He's only 10 months old and 1/2 lab so you know he's still a little rambunctious, with knees and elbows flying everywhere. He has the sweet, curious temperament of a lab. He has no idea his size and will try to sit on top of you if he can. He's also a pro counter-surfer. He currently is very thin and weighs 62 lbs. He is eating 8 cups of puppy food a day. I think he's happy to have the extra groceries. Gus is also 1/2 ridgeback. He has a perfect ridge all the way down his back. Gus is heartworm negative, and fully vetted. He doesn't chew things and isn't destructive at all. He gets along with my dogs, although they get tired of his playful energy. If you walk him daily (he's a great leash walker), he's calmer in the house. Gus likes to be wherever you are. He is not a fan of the crate, but does well sleeping on the floor in our bedroom at night. We take our dogs outside throughout the day, and Gus has quickly figured out the house training bit. Gus should go to an active home, who will exercise him regularly. \n\nGus is a male Lab/Rhodesian Ridgeback that is around 10 months old and currently weighs 73 lbs.",

Her original family did not want her back so she came to TAPS. Despite a little bit of bouncing, it has not broken Rubydoo's spirit. She has definitely never met a stranger. \n\n\n\nRubydoo will need work on obedience and manners but her enthusiasm for life will make you forget she's not supposed to be jumping up on you. Due to her \"I love you, I love you, I love you\" spirit, she would do best in a home without small children because she would definitely knock them down with kisses. \n\n\n\nPotty training and crate training unknown.\n\n\n\nUPDATE: Rubydoo rides well in a car, but needs help getting into taller vehicles. She rode so well in my car and did not try to get in the front seat and simply enjoyed the ride and fell asleep. In my home, she was active, lively, very sweet and is quiet comfortable in a home setting. She will jump on your furniture and run through your house with her zest for life and loved having lots of toys to play with, but seemed most content with a nylabone. Rubydoo will need obedience training as she is very \"mouthy\" and needs to be taught that a dog toy is a proper chew toy (rather than your arm, and presumably furniture). She did not have any accidents in my home and gave a subtle message that she needed to go outside by walking around my back door so potential adopters may need to help her with potty training.",

She is now close to needing to go on a diet! She has gained weight and her skin issues have significantly cleared up. Milly is a big girl but has a sweet, feminine personality. She loves new people after she has had some time to warm up. Milly is a bit anxious and will do best in a home where her folks are not gone for long hours. She loves to go out for walks and to soak in the fresh air. To meet Milly, call the shelter at 513-735-2299 to schedule an appointment.",

            "description": "Lotus is about 45 lbs. She looks like a miniature American Bulldog with a very sweet and shy disposition. She is about 7 years old and lived a very sad life. She was very malnourished and forced to breed constantly to the point where she had mammary tumors which have been removed and biopsied. Thankfully they were benign. She does not care for other adult dogs, but her energy completely shifts when she sees a puppy. Surely because she had so many she bonded with taken from her :( Lotus is looking for a family who will love her and respect her.  She loves toys, balls, bones as she was deprived for so long. We hope more than anything to find the person or family who can give Lotus the life she deserves. We would even love if someone would be open to fostering her which requires no adoption commitment and no fees are associated with fostering\nAfter the terrible life she lived, she is still so incredibly sweet, loving and easy going. If you are open to fostering this sweet girl and helping change her life forever, please email us for more information.",

She was pregnant and gave birth under a shed around 12/8. She had five puppies: Males: Callan (cream), Duncan - (black) and Liam - brown. Females: Fallon - cream and Finley. They are now safe and warm with their temporary foster in Edna TX. Bridget is pretty signifcantly underweight (we'll fix that!) but our vet says the puppies are fat and healthy. Bridget has a slight limp to her back leg.\nShe and her puppies will come to the Virginia area in January/February.If you are an approved adopter and are interested in this dog, please let your case worker know. If you are not yet an approved adopter but are interested, please complete an adoption application!\nYou can review our adoption process, www.shenandoahrescue.org/adoption-process if interested. Donations can be made at shenandoahrescue.org/donate or on PayPal to info@shenandoahrescue.org",

            "description": "Bosley is a 1 year old tri-color pit/ lab who is looking to be somebody\u2019s best friend.\n\n Bosley is a wonderful dog, loves every single human he meets, loves kids, and would like to find a new human that lives an active lifestyle that Bosley could join. \n\nHe needs to be the only dog in the home, so he will not be placed in a home with other dogs - while he is not reactive and doesn\u2019t lunge at other dogs on the leash \n he has displayed signs of not always playing well with others and has shown signs of aggression with my older dog... therefore he will do best as an only dog. When it comes to humans, he has never met a human he doesn't like, he is the friendliest and happiest dog in the world. He loves cats, however he plays rough as he is still young and most cats tend to not favor his style of playing. He is e-collar trained, loves swimming, going for jogs, knows how to sit, stay, come, down, etc ...\n\n Bosley is still a puppy so he is high energy, of you are looking for a slow, calm, minimal energy dog Bosley is not the right dog for you. If you are looking for a dog that loves to go for jogs, will play fetch as long as you let him, will go on road trips, camping, etc ...\n\n Bosley would be perfect, he has done all of these things with me! While he wouldn\u2019t make the best guard dog (he\u2019s kind of a wimp) he has made my home feel very safe by barking when necessary and doing his best to play the part. I\u2019m not in a rush to find Bosley a home, however I know that there is someone else who can provide him with a more suitable lifestyle than I can.\n Bosley used to go to work every day with me, unfortunately we now have new rules which prevents Bosley from being able to come with me ... being confined from 8am-8pm just isn\u2019t fair to a puppy, so I am having to make this very difficult decision.",

Max seems to not mind other dogs, however we always recommend doing a meet and greet before adopting. Max is a lover and just wants to be love, he would do well with older children in the home since he is bigger and likes to press up against you.

            "description": "Christmas- yes that\u2019s her name- wants to bring holiday cheer to your family all year long! This sweet, spunky and beautiful girl has spent most of her puppy hood recovering from surgery on her back legs. She gets stronger every day and now it\u2019s time for her to be the puppy she never got to be! She is destined to grow into a beautiful and loving Pyr. Christmas is incredibly well trained and knows tons of commands. She is also crate trained, housetrained and leash trained. She loves being with her humans and has never met a stranger. Despite her mobility constraints Christmas loves to play with canine companions. She will do best with dogs her size or smaller so that they don\u2019t risk hurting her. She needs assistance getting in the car or up on the couch, but her mobility is getting better and it hasn\u2019t stopped her from being an energetic love bug. Christmas has so much love and cuddles to give her new family - apply for this beautiful girl today to add Christmas joy to your family all year round!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nView full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed. \n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

She loves people and is so grateful to have clean soft bedding, regular walks and attention for the first time in a long time and would love to start the new year off in a stable loving home. She would prefer to be your only pet but loves people and greets everyone like a long lost friend. She was never spayed unfortunately and as a result sadly has lots of small mammary tumors, too many to remove all. The ones removed were biopsied and happily were benign and no sign of cancer currently but the remaining ones will need to be monitored for changes. She's full recovered and is a happy wiggly girl who loves her walks and would be so appreciative to finally have a real home for the first time in her life! Please submit an application for an appointment to meet her. Primary Color: White Secondary Color: Brown Age: 10yrs 1mths 1wks",

            "description": "Daina is a 7 year old, gorgeous, red colored, floppy eared, curly tailed Anatolian Shepherd/Red Bone Hound Mix that is looking for someone to love and care for her for always. Daina was left with a person in a temporary status, but sadly her owner ended up not being able to take her back so she has come to rescue to find her new home. She is of course house trained, crate trained and walks well using a harness. She knows sit, shake down and command (go to crate). She will bark to alert you but doesn't dig or chew on anything that she shouldn't. Daina enjoys a good snooze on the couch and is super happy to cuddle and netflix with you on a rainy day. She's good with kids and cats but needs a proper introduction to doggy friends to make sure everyone is friends. She is super friendly, a true gentle giant, she\u2019s not really interested in toys but is super food motivated and loves any kind of treat. This sweet girl cannot wait to find her new home and she hopes her family will come along soon and swoop her up!\n\nGolden Rewards Program\n\nAll of our adoptable grey muzzled gentle giants who are at least 7 years young are available for adoption for a reduced $250 donation!\n\nAlready a Golden Rewards Club member? If you've adopted a senior gentle giant from Big Dogs Huge Paws in the past, we have great news for you! Adopt a second senior for a Golden Rewards Club adoption donation of $200, and if it's your third senior dog adoption we are offering a special Golden Rewards Club reduced donation of only $150! Why wait?\n\n\n\nTo see the most up to date adoption status of this dog, please visit www.bigdogshugepaws.com\nThis is just one of hundreds of gentle giants available for adoption at BDHPI! It is best not to get your heart set on any one particular dog upfront because there is no guarantee they will still be available once you are approved or that they are even the right match for your family. Purebred puppies are only eligible for adoption to giant breed experienced homes.",

Bandit has gone through a rough patch with the loss of an owner and then was surrendered to a local shelter. He is a bit confused and nervous with all these changes in his life so the shelter reached out to us in order to get him into a foster home to decompress and to start healing. Bandit is quite submissive and unsure of pretty much most things as he's not been exposed to much. He will need a fur sibling in his forever home as not only does he take comfort from them but he takes guidance and cues from their behaviors and reactions.

Amante was found as a stray and quickly made his way to BDHP for some assistance in just that! Amante is said to be very laid back, and is absolutely friendly as can be towards people and other dogs. He walks well on a leash and is house trained and trustworthy with free roam. Amante came to us very sick with a huge open abscess which our medical team is having treated and evaluated. As he settles into his foster home, we are sure his personality will truly start to shine! Once he\u2019s cleared for takeoff, will you be this handsome boy's soft landing?\n\nGolden Rewards Program\n\nAll of our adoptable grey muzzled gentle giants who are at least 7 years young are available for adoption for a reduced $250 donation!\n\nAlready a Golden Rewards Club member? If you've adopted a senior gentle giant from Big Dogs Huge Paws in the past, we have great news for you! Adopt a second senior for a Golden Rewards Club adoption donation of $200, and if it's your third senior dog adoption we are offering a special Golden Rewards Club reduced donation of only $150! Why wait?\nTo see the most up to date adoption status of this dog, please visit www.bigdogshugepaws.com\nThis is just one of hundreds of gentle giants available for adoption at BDHPI!

Thank you! \n****************\n\nBrutus is an approximately 1 year old Pit or Pit mix mix that is currently available for adoption at the Des Moines County Humane Society in Burlington, Iowa. A meet and greet would be required with any other dogs that would be in a potential adopter's home.  Brutus is a very sweet boy.  He's playful and walks pretty good on a leash.  Brutus does seem to \"gobble\" his food so a home that will monitor this while keeping children away from him during meal times is needed.  Brutus is an absolutely beautiful boy! \n\nAll dog adoptions include the spay/neuter, heartworm test, first two sets of basic immunizations as well as a rabies vaccine and a vet visit. Our adoption fee is $125.00 and all dogs do require an approved application. \n\nPlease note our adoption hours: Tues-Fri from 3-6pm and from 1-5 on the weekends. We are closed on Mondays!",

He is full of muscle and will need an experienced family who can handle him and provide plenty of exercise daily.  He does get along with other dogs but would be best as the only dog in the home.  Neko is super lovable once he gets to know you but can play hard to get until he forms a bond.  He knows how handsome he is and that new people will work for his affection! Once he comes out of his shell, he is a goofy and loving boy.  Neko does very well at the vet and has such a great temperament. Older/big dog experienced children due to his size and strength.",

She loves attention and playing. She's very intense when it comes to toys and tennis balls. Instead of sitting (which she will do on command) and waiting for you to throw the ball for fetch, she jumps up in your face! This gal might be 8 years old but she still loves to run, play and fetch. I didn't take the ball from her mouth but instead, I would find another one. And when she saw that second one, she was vertical within a split second to try and take it from your hands. In other words, you better be ready to move when out with Nitro! Nitro seems house trained, too. Interested in this big girl? Call the VBACAC at 385-4444 or go to our FB page to make an appointment to meet her.",

While Scooby is missing a rear leg (we don't know why; he came to us this way- with a badly broken other rear leg), it doesn't slow him down one bit. In fact, a very smart, skilled vet once told us \"dogs are born with three legs and a spare\" and it's true; Scooby is proof. He can run and play the same as any other dog- and he loves other dogs (cats are an unknown but we can cat test upon request).\n\nScooby is current on his vaccinations and deworming, is microchipped and neutered and his broken back leg has been surgically repaired and has no issues. He is fostered in Jacksonville, and his adoption fee is just $250, which includes all of the aforementioned vetting.\n\nHome visit and reference checks are required and are NOT negotiable.\n\nScooby is waiting for you! 1/31/21 2:27 PM",

            "description": "Duncan is an 1-year-old male Black Lab mix who has already been neutered. He is a return adoption because his energy was more than his adopter could handle. Duncan is a very handsome fellow. He has a super shiny black coat with a little white markings on his chest. Duncan weighs 41 pounds and we believe he will be a medium sized adult dog. He is very frisky, active, and has boundless energy! Duncan will need a nice yard with a sturdy fence where he can safely play and exercise. This sweet boy would be just fine in a home with children and other dogs. For Duncan to have a successful adoption, his adopters must understand that he is a great dog who will need some patience with his silly puppy like antics. Duncan has the potential to be a fantastic family dog with a family who will just help him to reach his full level of awesomeness.Dog/puppy adoption fees are $120 and cat/kitten adoption fees are $50. Our adoption fees cover a microchip, microchip registration, discounted spay/neuter certificate, deworming, vaccinations (as age and law requires), and a courtesy vet exam at participating offices. Unless otherwise indicated under 'special needs' our dogs have screened heart worm negative.",

He is a wonderful, sweet boy, but sadly, his heartbroken owners were no longer able to keep him. They surrendered him to the shelter to help him find a loving new home. This adorable boy is looking for an active home where he will gets tons of exercise and attention. He is super outgoing and loves everyone he meets! He is also very playful and lively! Tucker is still working on some of his manners so he will need a home that will train him and work with him. He seems to be housebroken, dog friendly and walks well on a leash. \n\nADOPTION HOURS: \n\nWe are currently adopting out animals by appointment only Tuesday through Sunday 1:00 P.M. through 4:00 P.M. with an approved application.

Chip was very thin and a matted mess, and the pound had to shave him down.\n\nChip had a mass removed that turned out to be a rare follicular cancer, but luckily one that has a good prognosis with good margins. He did get very good margins, so he should be just fine. He is an incredibly good boy with just the sweetest temperament and loves everyone he meets.\n\nChocolate Chip has a potential home, but if he does become available we will let you know here. If you too would like to become a foster to adopt home, please read our adoption policies. If you qualify, just write our adoption team for an adoption application. During the holidays, we are not sending out new applications for adoption. We hope this will change soon after the first of the year.",

            "description": "Jack is a special dog very close to our hearts here at Hail Mary Rescue. At 6 weeks old, Jack and his siblings were brought to 501c in Southeast Louisiana that advertised as a Sanctuary. For SIX YEARS they were locked in a 10x10 kennel with limited interaction except with each other. We took out Jack and his brother, Jerry, July 2020 while others went to different rescues. After several months of rehab with both dogs, Jerry found his forever home where is doing excellent. Jack is still with us and we are looking for the following home to open their hearts for this dog who has gone through so much. Must have a friendly dog for Jack to hang with. He thrives on following and playing with other dogs. Must have patience and allow Jack to bond with you in his own time. Please consider him. He is truly worthy of a home.\n\nHail Mary Rescue doesn't just have Southern Dogs. We have CAJUN Southern Dogs!! The smartest, strong hearted, \"Get back on your feet after being knocked down hard\", dogs there are. Just like our Cajun ancestors. Now if we can just teach the younger generation to spay/neuter, our Cajun Dogs wouldn't have to go through so much just to stay alive.\n\nHail Mary Rescue, a 501c3 non profit, saves dogs from southeast Louisiana shelters. It is a foster-based rescue which gives pets the opportunity to live in home settings where they are house and crate trained, learn basic obedience commands, and are well socialized, many with children and other dogs. Exposure to cats depends on the foster's home. Adoption fee is $200 for LA adoptions; $400 (includes transportation fee for out-of-state adoptions). All dogs are completely vetted, vaccinated, spay/neutered, and micro-chipped prior to adoption. See your new best friend?

If you are a good fit for the animal you are interested in -we will call to speak with you, If we feel you are not a good fit , we will contact you about other pets that may be a good fit for your home. Many people are losing the opportunity to adopt the animal they want because they fail to put in an application and the pet was adopted before we could answer your email. .If you have applied for an animal in our facility and have not received a response within 7 days, PLEASE call or contact us again. Though we do our best in trying to answer all emails in a timely manner, sometimes things get away from us, get lost or misplaced.

He is fond of other dogs and would enjoy a home with another calm dog. Because we suspect he may have been used as a hunting dog, we do not recommend a home with small animals (cats, etc.) or small dogs. Hunter is a very loving and gentle boy but would do best in a home with older children. He loves to be petted and adored, but also enjoys his walks and play time. A fenced in yard would be ideal for him. He is a WONDERFUL young dog that has many years of love to give to his forever family. Please let us know if you would like to meet his handsome guy!",

We are looking for a home for both Rebound and Halo together for the rest of their forever. Their owner worked at a dog boarding kennel in New Mexico and she sadly passed away while they were being boarded. A rescue was sought out for these two and that is where UDR came in. Rebound and Halo traveled by plane and auto to get to Minnesota. It took a few weeks before we could get everything organized for these two lovelies, but they are here now, looking for love. Rebound is the more confident of the two, almost as if he is looking over his girl Halo. Without her he is very lonely we have seen, even if she goes outside without him, he will wait for her return. These two are bonded completely. They eat, sleep and hang out together. Rebound is heart worm negative, neutered and current on vaccines. If you are interested in adopting not one but two very awesome dogs that will love you and watch over you for their forever, please apply to adopt these two lovelies!",

Memphis is fully house-trained and shows great promise to learn many tricks. He loves to jump over things, too, so a 6' fence would be a must for this spring-loaded \"Tigger\" wannabe.\n\nHe \"kennel\"s when told if food or a treat is involved and he NEVER misses a meal. He loves to take car rides, gives the best snuggles, & plays well with other dogs and older children. He is soft, handsome, and a very majestic-looking dog with eyes the color of amber.\n\nHail Mary Rescue doesn't just have Southern Dogs. We have CAJUN Southern Dogs!! The most Smartest, Strong Hearted, \"Get back on your feet after being knocked down hard\", dogs there are. Just like our Cajun ancestors. Now if we can just teach the younger generation to spay/neuter, our Cajun Dogs wouldn't have to go through so much just to stay alive.\n\nHail Mary Rescue, a 501c3 non profit, saves dogs from southeast Louisiana shelters. It is a foster-based rescue which gives pets the opportunity to live in home settings where they are house and crate trained, learn basic obedience commands, and are well socialized, many with children and other dogs. Exposure to cats depends on the foster's home. Adoption fee is $200 for LA adoptions; $400 (includes transportation fee for out-of-state adoptions). All dogs are completely vetted, vaccinated, spay/neutered, and micro-chipped prior to adoption. See your new best friend?

            "description": "Everybody clear the way for Keno!  This boy is HUGE weighing in at 150 pounds.  Keno is a Lab/Mastiff mix who was rescued from a shelter in Kentucky, after being surrendered by his owner who had too many doggies.  Keno is roughly 7 years old, has the stature of a lab but the mass of a Mastiff. \n\nKeno is a complete love bug for sure.  He loves to give kisses and curl up next to your feet and even in your lap.  That\u2019s right, this 150 pound dog is a big ole lapdog!  Keno has meet a variety of dogs in his foster, definitely prefers the very low key seniors and is over the hyper ones lol!  We believe Keno may have been large and in charge at his former crowded home.  \n\nThis guy is ready to live out his golden years as your own and only.  He says he has had enough of being the big man of the house. \n\nKeno would do best with a fenced in yard as he is very strong and needs some leash work.  He is friendly to people but would most likely knock the little kiddos down as he is strong.  Keno seems to be house trained and has had zero accidents inside.  This hunk is very sweet, dog friendly, and could stand to lose some poundage, but don't tell him I said that!\n\nOnce at our vet's office, this poor sweetie tested positive for Lyme, but that hasn\u2019t affected his happy personality one bit!  Lyme is a tick borne disease that is not contagious to other dogs or humans but will remain in his system, throughout his life.  Keno may have an occasional flare-up which would be indicated by joint pain/inflammation, limping, lethargy and possible loss of appetite.  Typically a dose of antibiotics is enough to make the disease go dormant again.  To help control the Lyme, Keno will need a yearly Lyme vaccine.  Should he have multiple flare ups in a short amount of time, his kidneys could be affected.  Lyme has become more prevalent in the southern states, and many dogs with this disease have lived long happy lives!\n\nAll HART dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped and up to date on all vaccines, including bordatella and rabies.   They are heartworm tested and on preventative for heartworm, fleas, and ticks.   If you are interested in any of our pets, you must complete an online dog adoption application   at www.rescueAhart.org .   The application will put you in touch with this wonderful dog's foster family so you can schedule a meeting.   Thanks!   www.rescueAhart.org",

Please contact the owner for more information or to adopt: \nPLEASE CONTACT monica.body@aspca.org\nPLEASE CONTACT monica.body@aspca.org FOR MORE INFORMATION OR TO MAKE AN APPLICATION FOR ADOPTION. NOTE: THIS IS A COURTESY POSTING ONLY! THIS DOG IS NOT AVAILABLE THROUGH BROTHER WOLF ANIMAL RESCUE\n\nPeach, a poem: I'm not too big and I'm not too small. I'm not too fast, but I also don't crawl. Playing with doggie friends is where it's at, and who knows, I may even love your cat. I may start shy but don't you cry. Soon you'll see me smile bright and learn that all around, I'm just right!\n\nThis adorable girl is Peach. She is a medium sized, young, silly girl who enjoys walks and LOVES playing with other dogs. In fact, sweet Peach would really like a home with another playful dog or the chance for regular puppy playdates. Peach can be shy at first meeting new people but once she warms up she greets her favorite people with full body wags and a great big smile.\n\nPeach is a recent graduate of the ASPCA's Behavioral Rehabilitation Center (BRC) in Weaverville, NC. The BRC is the first and only facility of its kind dedicated to the study and rehabilitation of extremely fearful dogs.

A few weeks ago, Philly Bully Team posted for a foster, and we weren't sure how long it would take to find one since Charlie needs to be an only pet and since some people may be turned off by her history. Thankfully, her foster mom sent in an application almost immediately, and she even drove 18 hours to pick Charlie up so she wouldn't have to wait a few weeks for transport. \n\nSince arriving less than 3 weeks ago, Charlie has made huge strides. She's opened up to her foster family and their friends, and she has settled in beautifully (which is all the more remarkable considering she had never been in a home before). She warms up to people very quickly and gives a ton of Charlie kisses. Despite her horrific past, Charlie is thriving and spreading her love to every human she meets. Her happiness and energy are absolutely contagious. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application on our website: www.phillybullyteam.com",

He came into the shelter on Dec. 18 as a lost dog with ID, but his family could not be contacted -- that's why it's so important to keep microchip information up-to-date with a new address or phone number. He is a very sweet dog and super cute, very calm and easy going and great on a leash. His family is no doubt searching for him. Little Bit is about 3 years old and weighs 60 pounds. He has not been neutered yet, but the vet will see him soon. He is up-to-date on vaccinations and will be heartworm tested upon adoption. Come meet him in Run 86 using ID#626518.\n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information. Shelter hours are: Tues. - Sun. 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. by appointment only until further notice, CLOSED Mondays & Holidays.",

            "description": "Greta is the most beautiful brindle girl with the sweetest personality! We think she is around 3 years old and a Shepherd mix. She is as sweet as can be and revels in human attention. Greta loves to ride in the car and enjoys her two times a day walks without much pulling on leash. She is house trained, has good house manners and is good in the crate. Greta is well behaved for baths and gentle taking treats. She gets along with all the dogs she has met and likes to play, but doesn't need another dog in her forever home to be happy. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting Greta when she is ready for adoption, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs. Thank you for rescuing.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue.

            "description": "Animal Profile: Judy is a young-at-heart spry 8-year-old Shepherd mix (possibly with Corgi given her coloring and short legs). She was surrendered to our rescue in December after her owner (who recently adopted her from Eastern WA) determined her behavior needs were too much to handle. Specifically, Judy is leash reactive to dogs and the gal lived in an apartment in the city. Judy has no history of biting people or dogs. Upon evaluation it was evident that Judy was not dog aggressive but just unsure of how to greet other dogs. She did well with a structured walk and slow dog introductions and is currently in a foster home with a dog and a cat. Judy is friendly with people and would benefit from a single family residence (no apartments) and an experienced family who can provide leadership to help her feel secure. We will share more information about Judy once we get to know her in foster care.\n\nFoster Updates:\nJudy is a human friendly loving companion. On walks with a training collar she can walk by other dogs with some anxiety (whining) and is improving on a daily basis. In the home she ignores the resident dog (no aggression). She is a bit too curious with the cat so probably better in a feline free house. No issues with any humans or kids. Good in the crate!\n\nAdoption Info: Adoption fee is $350 which includes spay/neuter, all core vaccinations, microchip, heartworm test and health certificate. Your adoption fee may be tax deductible as Dog Gone Seattle is a federal 501c3 organization.\n\nApply online: www.doggoneseattle.org/adoption-application",

            "description": "Animal Profile: Sadie is a 6-7 year old 35 lb mixed breed who was surrendered to the rescue in December as it had become increasingly apparent to her owner that she was uncomfortable and stressed in the busy household with toddlers. Sadie has no history of aggression but would thrive in a calm and quiet household as she can be an anxious girl. She is very dog social and soft, but will benefit from a quiet but confident human to help her with her confidence. Sadie would likely do fine in a home with a cat as well. She is house trained and generally quiet. She was diagnosed at 2 years with IBD though further diagnostics such as food trials were not explored. Her IBD is generally easy to manage with a bland diet and she is not on medication but when she is stressed she can have flare ups. We will share more info about Sadie as we get to know her in foster care.\n\nFoster Updates:\nSadie is shy and guarded at first but once she trusts you she is just the sweetest, affectionate and friendly. She would probably enjoy a dog buddy in the home. She is quiet and good in the crate.\n\nDiet Info: Upon intake to our rescue Sadie received a Nutriscan for food allergies due to her history of \"tummy issues.\" Results indicate sensitivities to corn, turkey and fish. Sadie is currently eating a lamb based food and has had no issues or flare ups.\n\nAdoption Info: Adoption fee is $350 which includes spay/neuter, all core vaccinations, microchip, heartworm test and health certificate. Your adoption fee may be tax deductible as Dog Gone Seattle is a federal 501c3 organization.\n\nApply online: www.doggoneseattle.org/adoption-application",

When she's at home she will lay by your side or work hard on her commands to earn treats. She is very cuddly and loves to be petted while resting her head on your leg.

EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY:  Meetings at our Adoption Center are by appointment only (no walk-ins).  An online adoption application is required and must be approved prior to meeting any animals.  Adoption appointments are set up by email by our Adoption Coordinator (no phone calls, please).  This process ensures our dedicated time to the animals in our care, as well as full attention to adopters at scheduled times.  \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY:  Meetings at our Adoption Center are by appointment only (no walk-ins).  An online adoption application is required and must be approved prior to meeting any animals.  Adoption appointments are set up by email by our Adoption Coordinator (no phone calls, please).  This process ensures our dedicated time to the animals in our care, as well as full attention to adopters at scheduled times.  \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

            "description": "Eileen is a miracle.\n\nEileen was abandoned with her brother Elliott in Southeast Missouri and during her spay surgery, it was discovered she had a Diaphragmatic Hernia, which most likely occurred when hit by a vehicle. \n\nEileen had emergency surgery on Monday, 12/21, and has bounced back quickly. She is anxious to get her life moving forward and a family of her very own is at the top of her holiday list.\n\nEileen has the best personality and temperament, constantly giving kisses and leaning in for pets.  She will crawl right in your lap as if she is a tiny lap dog.\n\nDid we mention Eileen is absolutely gorgeous? Her photos do not do her justice. \n\nEileen survived a vehicle incident, her heart slowing during prep to be spayed and then emergency diaphragmatic hernia surgery.  The universe must have something very special planned for her.\n\nIF SERIOUS, PLEASE APPLY AT WWW.K9EI.DOG, DO NOT SEND PETFINDER INQUIRIES.  \n\nUpdate: \nHappy Holidays, \n\nWe asked people on her Petfinder Bio to not Petfinder inquiry with us as we do not return those inquiries and instead apply for the dog.  We received a dozen applications for Eileen within an hour of posting her and we review the applications for approval in the order we receive them.  Once we have approved applications we make calls to interview potential adopters.\n\nOur adoption application is located online at www.k9ei.dog.  If your application is approved, you will be given the opportunity to meet the dog following an interview. \n\nI can tell you that Eileen has 4 weeks of recovery ahead of her which entails crate rest, leash walking to potty, and then back inside the home, she must wear the cone for 4 weeks to protect against licking her incision which is large. The incision must be kept dry and checked for infection daily. She needs to have an ice pack held on the incision 3 times daily to keep swelling down for the first 7 days following surgery.\n\nEileen should not climb stairs or be jumping to prevent the stretching of her skin where the incision runs along the whole of her body. It's vital to her recovery to not developing an infection or the opening of the incision. \n\nShe is 9 months old and even with her breathing taxed before surgery, she was a very active dog.  She is a mix of Great Pyrenees and mystery dog, she is small compared to a purebred GP.  She does have the sense to wander away from home as they were bred to be on ranches/farms protecting livestock.  When healed she will need exercise and adventure to keep her happy.  \n\nShe is not trained in any way shape or form.  Most likely she and her brother were put out by breeders or wandered away from the breeder's home.  The surgeon's best guess is she was struck by a vehicle that pushed her stomach, liver, and intestine up into her ribcage placing pressure on the heart.  \n\nThe surgery consisted of removing the organs and placing them in their correct position, mending the diaphragm, removing scar tissue, performing a second surgery of sewing her stomach into place to prevent bloating, and then they finished by spaying her.  \n\nDespite the intensive surgeries, she returned to her happy go lucky self by the late night.  Tail wagging, smiles, walked outside the hospital to potty, eating fine and allowing for icing of the incision 3 times a day.\n\nThis is all we know about Eileen, her brother is very much similar and doing well in his foster to adopt home.  He has the same fun-loving free spirit personality. We do not know how she is with other animals, she shows no reaction to dogs passing her in the hospital cage, nor has she been around children.\n\nThank you for your interest,\n\nCynthia\n\n\n\n",

            "description": "MEET CHIP 5!!\n\nFrom Chip's Foster: Chip is awesome. Sometimes we call him Chipper Dipper! I love him alot. We got him from a dog shelter in Ohio when he was three months old on Mother's Day. They got him from an overcrowded shelter in Alabama. We moved to Arizona a year ago. That's how he got here! He and I did training together. He is very smart but at times when overly excited forgets his manners. He will jump up but if you are consistent he knows your expectations, but each person has to let him know jumping up is not ok. He loves treat rewards. He gets water spray bottle as consequence only if needed. He is still a puppy mentality so will chew things he shouldn't if you are not checking on him. He loves to chew on non rawhide bones. He especially lives to play fetch and will bring ball back. He will look for the ball if you say go get your ball. His favorite command! He can sit, stay, step up, lay down, come, walks nice on leash but would be even better if we took more walks. He has no problem with a gentle check of his teeth or ears. He does well with groomer trimming his nails and once he is in the bath he seems to enjoy a warm bath. We use halter collar for his walks. He is fenced, and needs to be to keep him safe. He prefers to be inside. He has only been an inside dog. He is crate trained while we are gone and for bedtime. He is ok in cars, just not his favorite thing. He loves to be with me and will follow me if he doesn't see me but does not get separation anxiety. He is not an off leash dog when out in community or hiking. He tends to eat fast so we use a slow down bowl but I think it's so he can go and try to get the other two dogs food if they walk away. He needs to be only dog. He has become aggressive toward my other two dogs regarding food and attention from us. He has never been people aggressive. Never. He's a good boy just wants all our love. He will cuddle, likes to sit right next to me touching or when on the floor he will lay on my foot. I love that. He is healthy, current on all vet care but I have found that foods can cause him an skin allergy that looks awful. I haven't had him allergy tested. He has micro chip. He has had excellent get care. He would make a couple or single person who will give him lots of time, love and activity a wonderful pet. Again he should be the only pet. Should not go to home with someone planning to start a family or someone who is gone alot. Oh, he is potty trained. We have a doggy dog that he uses , but he prefers to have us open it. I think it's because he is tall but again he uses the doggie door. If you want a loving, incredible well loved never harmed dog, Chips your man. , We will ask for rehoming fee and will need to be comfortable with applicants in the household to ensure commitment to him, time for him, that he will be only dog and that he will be safe and well cared for. If this sounds like you it could be a great match for Chip!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this dog, please visit our website for our online application www.underdogaz.com\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This dog is courtesy posted for another individual or Rescue.

He was with multiple dogs but sometimes leery of new dogs. He now gets to come in at night and sleeps in a crate. He does pretty good on leash, but will need practice.\n\nContact this animals foster home at SaveMeAdoptMe@gmail.com or text or leave a message at 573-512-2102.

            "description": "Animal Profile: Bunz is a 55-60 Lab / Pit Bull mix that was rescued from a high kill shelter in Victor Valley CA. He is estimated to be around 2 years old and will join us on December 20th. More info to come once he arrives and settles in!\n\nSeattle Foster update: Bunz is a playful pup that walks well on a leash. Bunz does need someone willing to explore training to help him overcome his excitability and learn to focus as he lacks handler awareness. Many dogs that have been shuffled through homes and shelters were never given the opportunity of a proper learning environment so they end up bringing many of their puppy like behaviors into adulthood. Bunz does very well when the handler promotes leadership in the relationship. Bunz is dog friendly but needs guidance in regards to manners when around them.\n\nIf you have natural leadership capabilities, are willing to provide structure and guidance for Bunz, he will be a wonderful companion for years to come in return.\n\nBunz currently lives with a cat and a dog and is not aggressive towards them but still needs a lot of guidance from his handler.\n\nAdoption Info: Adoption fee is $500, which includes spay/neuter, current rabies/DAPPV/bordetella vaccinations, microchip, health certificate, and heartworm test. All adoption fees are donations to a Washington non-profit corporation and all donations go to benefit the animals in our rescue.\n\nApply online at www.DogGoneSeattle.org\n\nAnimal History: This dog was rescued from euthanasia at a high-kill shelter in California and will be available for adoption in Seattle, once evaluated in a loving foster home in the greater Seattle area.",

            "description": "UPDATE: Sweet Kahlua had her ACL surgery January 14th and has started an arduous 12 weeks of recovery.  Sadly, the damage was much more extensive than we anticipated.  Kahlua has obviously been suffering and in pain for quite some time.  \nWe are so very thankful to Dr. B at Healthy Pets Animal Hospital who performed this intricate surgery to give Kahlua a new start at life.  We are also beyond grateful for her wonderful foster parents, Nita and Robert, who graciously took this deserving dog into their home and are loving Kahlua like their own.  They have also committed to nursing her through her rehabilitation.  \nWe appreciate your prayers as Kahlua heals and stays strong in the months ahead!\n\nWelcome KAHLUA! This beautiful, gentle sweetheart has joined us just in time for Christmas! Kahlua is about 6 years old, was raised with a family with children, knows basic commands and is the perfect house pet.  Still plenty playful, she loves to play fetch, tug-o-war, and loves her walks. She adores children and reportedly gets along fine with other dogs.\nSadly, Kahlua lost her home because she needs ACL repair surgery that the family could not afford.  When Northwest German Shepherd heard her story, we just had to step in to help.  Kahlua will have ACL repair surgery in a few weeks and then will recuperate in her loving foster home.  \nWe will keep her profile posted as she heals and gets ready for a fresh start in a new home.",

As you can see from her photos, Lulu has the soulful eyes of a Beagle! They will draw you in and make you fall in love.  But before you get lost in those big brown Bette Davis eyes listen up.  Lulu is a strong-willed girl who know what she wants.  But what she wants and what she needs are not always the same thing.  \n\nLulu will need an owner who is a strong leader, as she desires to have direction and thrives when given it.  She has been through basic obedience and has proven to be very intelligent.  If you are a strong and calm leader for her, she will repay you by climbing right into your lap for snuggles.  She is very affectionate with her humans, loves to play with them, and loves to be outdoors with them.\n\nLike all goddesses, she does have one tragic flaw.  She's an opportunist. While she thrives under strong leadership, she will take advantage of any opportunity she can when it comes to calling the shots.  Basically, if you give her an inch she will likely roll her cute little barrel body all over it.  Like most alphas we know in this world, there are those who are meant to be in charge, and then those who WANT to be in charge but should not be. This is the case with our Lulu. In her head she is just doing what comes natural to her.  This is why she needs a person who will not mind reminding her she did not get that promotion she hoped for as boss lady of her new home.\n\nIf you would like to be considered to adopt Lulu, please complete the adoption application for Lulu online here: http://www.doubledogrescuevolunteers.org/adoption_application.php?dog=Lulu\n(please reach out to KateS@doubledogrescue.org if you run into any issues with the application process).\n\nFor specific questions about Lulu, please contact Michelle at michelled@doubledogrescue.org.",

She is current on vaccinations, has been spayed and microchipped and is current on heartworm & flea prevention. She is crate trained, great with other dogs and children.  She currently weighs about 40 pounds and is very playful.\nShe would do best in a home with another dog to play with due to her energy level and age with or a very active family that will keep her busy while she is so young and active .Though she is crate trained she would not fare well being crated all day by herself. \nShe needs a home with a fenced yard and is not an apartment kinda girl.\nSweet Hilda is in a Memphis area foster home. \n",

            "description": "Please take a moment to read Lennon\u2019s special letter to Santa to learn more about our sweet boy!\n\nDear Santa,\n \nLennon here, writing to you since my friend Lisa, our trainer, says I\u2019m the BEST boy and am definitely on your nice list. Some of my favorite things are car rides, snuggles, and walks in the woods, but what\u2019s at the top of my wish list is a forever home!\n \nI haven\u2019t always had it easy, Santa. I came from North Carolina as a puppy, and was adopted quickly cause I\u2019m great! My family took good care of me and tried their best but I got a medical problem called Immune Mediated Thrombocytopenia when I was first with them. It was hard for me and I know it was hard for them (my friends at the SPCA can tell you more about it. I\u2019m only 3, I don\u2019t get those big words!).\n \nI got better and for a while I was doing great. Playing and running with my family. But then this summer I got sick again; I had to go potty a lot. Lisa said it\u2019s like I ate bad take-out, whatever that means. I got real skinny and I now wear a jacket to stay warm and toasty. \n \nMy family tried so hard to help me but it was just too much for them. So they made the tough decision to bring me back to the SPCA. The docs here gave me more medicine and tried some more tests. And then, they figured out what could be wrong! It looks like I could have inflammatory Bowel Disease / Food Allergies. I\u2019m on some meds and doing much better, (Although, I still go potty a lot) but I still have a ways to go \u2019til I\u2019m 100%. So, Santa, this year I would like a foster-to-adopt home; this is a neat thing where someone falls in love with me, brings me home, helps me get fully healthy while the shelter pays the bills and takes care of all that, and then when I\u2019m all good they officially adopt me!\n \nSo just to recap, Santa: super handsome dog, goodest boy in all the land (per me), looking for a low-key kinda home with a fenced yard (and maybe a doggie door so I can go out whenever I need to!), a couch to curl up on, and a person or people to snuggle with.\n \nWork your magic, Santa! And maybe your elves here on social media can SHARE my letter to help my wish come true \u2013 tell everyone to email Lisa at trainer@spca914.org for more info or to meet me! Can\u2019t wait!!\n \nxoxoxo, Lennon\n\nDue to Covid-19 the SPCA is allowing adoptions by appointment only. If you\u2019d like to discuss an animal and/or set up a meet and greet please email shelter@spca914.org with your competed application and a copy of your driver\u2019s license or a government issued ID. Please allow up to 72 hours for a response! Thank you for your understanding! \n\n\nAdults dogs over 1 year of age: $225-$375\nAll Puppies: $375\nSeniors and Lonely Hearts Club members: $85\n\nPlease visit: https://spca914.org/adopt/adoption-process to read our Adoption Policy and Procedures in full.\n\nFeel free to e-mail shelter@spca914.org or call (914) 941-2896 ext. 11 with any questions or for more details on the dog(s) in which you are interested.\n\nNYS Registration # RR056",

Before that I was at the Humane Society in Topeka, KS. I was adopted twice but I was returned to the Humane Society both times. My adopters didn't pay enough attention to me so I kept escaping my yard and went looking for friends. I really love people and attention! I'm a pretty chill guy and like being petted, but I'm not in your face about it. If you scratch my neck I will close my eyes and lean on you. I am very gentle with my Pyr Paw. Sometimes I even put up two paws and I almost fall over backwards in the process! I'm house trained, like to go for walks, and I like to play in the water. I like treats and will sit for them. Other dogs are my friends and I would prefer a female in my new home. My foster dad introduced me to cats at the vets office and I paid them no mind. I do require a 6 ft fence so I don't go on walkabouts. I will come to you microchipped, neutered, up to date on vaccinations, and up to date on heartworm and flea/tick preventatives. I really need my next home to be my Furever home. I'm ready to make a family really happy! \n\nApplicants must have a secure and visible fence. In order for your application to be approved, you must also pass a home check and a vet check which includes having at least a two year vet history. Children in my home need to be 10 years of age or older. I can be adopted in Missouri and surrounding states: Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, and Arkansas. My rescue is able to transport me to those states. If you would like to give me a furever home, please fill out an application on my rescue website. \n\nBeing fostered in Holden, MO",

She loves everyone and sets very clear boundaries with other dogs and kids.\n\nLadybug was found in bad shape on the mean streets of Texas. Luckily she went to the best foster in the world who has nursed her back to health. Ladybug is doing very well now although she still has some skin allergies. A high quality wholesome diet makes all the difference in the world. \n\nLadybug is fostered in a home with multiple other dogs, a lot of personalities, and an 8 year old child. She gets along with all of them and looks forward to her time playing outside with them.\u00a0She is crate trained, but at night she prefers to share a dog bed with the 8 year old child.\u00a0\n\nLadybug is currently being fostered in Houston, TX. We have adopted to many very happy families in your area and can provide references. We use an amazing ground transport that goes to the your area twice a month. \n\nLadybug is up to date on shots, neutered, and microchipped.

She loves everyone and sets very clear boundaries with other dogs and kids.\n\nLadybug was found in bad shape on the mean streets of Texas. Luckily she went to the best foster in the world who has nursed her back to health. Ladybug is doing very well now although she still has some skin allergies. A high quality wholesome diet makes all the difference in the world. \n\nLadybug is fostered in a home with multiple other dogs, a lot of personalities, and an 8 year old child. She gets along with all of them and looks forward to her time playing outside with them.\u00a0She is crate trained, but at night she prefers to share a dog bed with the 8 year old child.\u00a0\n\nLadybug is currently being fostered in Houston, TX. We have adopted to many very happy families in your area and can provide references. We use an amazing ground transport that goes to the your area twice a month. \n\nLadybug is up to date on shots, neutered, and microchipped. Please fill out an application on our website www.goodlif3bullyrescue.org/adoption-application-1 or email us at goodlif3adoptions@gmail.com if you are interested in Ladybug.",

Gizmo does not like to snuggle or cuddle with the other foster dogs. So if you are thinking of getting a friend for your dog, Gizmo would not be that kind of guy. Gizmo prefers people. Gizmo enjoys evenings of cuddling in front of the TV. Gizmo sleeps in bed with his foster parents. Gizmo does have some vision impairment. It seem like he is blind in his right eye and had limited vision in his left eye. This doesn't slow him down one bit. Gizmo has not had any accidents in the house and will go to the door to go out. Gizmo is vaccinated, microchipped and is heartworm negative. If you any questions about Gizmo you can e-mail his foster parents at fosterboyd2000@yahoo.com. If you are interested in adopting please fill out an application. Thank you for thinking rescue first! \nIf you think you might be interested in",

Please visit http://www.caninelifeline.org/adoption-process/ for more information about our adoption process and to submit an online application.\n\nCecelia is a loving and affectionate 1 year-old Boxer mix girl who came to us from an overcrowded county dog shelter. We don't have any history on her pre-shelter life or how she came to be at the shelter. Cecelia only weighs about 28 pounds so is definitely mixed with something smaller. For a young dog, she has a wonderfully calm and gentle demeanor. She has gotten along well with all other dogs she's met since coming to us but may prefer her canine buddies on the calm side. Cecelia also enjoys meeting new people and loves to snuggle up with her human friends once playtime is over. She has had excellent crate manners in her foster home so should be able to master the house rules fairly quickly in her new home. She walks quite nicely on a leash for a young dog and looks forward to accompanying her new family on lots of walks around her new neighborhood. Cecelia will likely need a sweater though as she's got a very short coat and doesn't seem to be a fan of cold weather. She would love a cozy spot by the fireplace to curl up and relax and we can't wait to see her doing just that in her new home. Cecelia weighs about 28 pounds and her adoption fee is $325. She's spayed, heartworm negative and on monthly preventative, up to date on vaccinations including bivalent canine influenza, wormed, on flea and tick preventative, and microchipped. As part of the adoption process, all adopters must commit to a two-week adjustment period to make sure it's a great match before the adoption is finalized. Please email info@caninelifeline.org if you're interested in Cecelia. An approved application is required before we schedule meets with any of our dogs. Please note that we don't place our dogs in homes with children under 7 years of age. We correspond via email so please check your junkmail or spam folder to make sure our reply hasn't landed in there. Please visit our website at www.caninelifeline.org to see more photos of Cecelia and to submit an online application if you live in Northeast OH.",

We were told that he is around 12 years old, though we suspect he may be younger. RUFUS does well with other dogs and is equally happy to rough house with the puppies in his foster home as he is to snooze the day away on a dog bed with his fellow seniors. He is irresistibly sweet and goofy and near impossible not to love. He appears to have spent most of his life outdoors, though has adapted to indoor life well and is OK being crated when left home alone. We\u2019ve had no problems with him in the house (no chewing, no marking) except for his regular attempts to sneak up onto the couch (lol). RUFUS still has plenty of spunk for an older dog and enjoys playing and going for walks.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adopting RUFUS, please shoot us an email at misfitrescue@gmail.com and we\u2019ll forward you our adoption questionnaire. His adoption fee is $75.00, which covers his neuter and basic vaccinations.",

            "description": "Theona #7497 is a beautiful 6-year-old female, Mastiff mix. Theo is a well-adjusted friendly gal. She seems to love everyone she meets. She is good a meeting dogs. She is crate trained and knows the commands sit, down and come. She enjoys going on walks and pulls only when she has to go potty. Theo thinks she is a lap dog. She loves to ride in the car. She came to us with Ehrlichia  and we are seeking an adopter who will continue LCAR\u2019s provided treatment at no cost.  She weighs 125 pounds and is full grown. This pup is microchipped. We believe you can always teach an \u2018old\u2019 dog new tricks, so we highly recommend continued obedience training for this smart pup; it stimulates the dog's mind and establishes a good dog/adopter relationship. This pup, like all pups, should be on heartworm preventative; an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. If you are interested in adopting this dog, and are already approved to adopt through our organization, please contact dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with the pup\u2019s name and ID number in the subject line. OTHERWISE, please submit an adoption application online: http://www.lastchanceanimalrescue.org/adoptus.html E-mail dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with questions.

We dont know what, if anything happened to her in her past, but she does not like young children.  She's living in foster home with a sweet, small boy dog and we'd love to see her in a forever home with a similar dog - a dog that will accept her and love her and bond with her (but it's not a deal breaker since she loves her people!).  Lucero is about 3-4 years old and around 8-pounds.  She's already spayed, healthy and had a dental. She's a very special little lady who loves her walks and LOVES to snuggle up.  Although she is as sweet as sugar, she is looking for an experienced home that knows how to implement boundaries and limitations - in return you'll get the sweetest, most adorable, portable  companion ever!  If you'd like to apply to adopt Lucero, submit our online adoption application on our website.\n\nThis is what her foster mom had to say about her:\n\nLucy is the sweetest little people-lover and belly-forward super snuggler. Her favorite thing is to be right up next to you on the couch. She is very observant and keeps a keen eye on what is happening around her. She likes calm & predictable environments. She's has an independent streak but will also shadow you all around the house. If her self-confidence is shaken she can experience separation anxiety, but when her confidence is built up, she's happy alone. She dances in circles when you come home. She loves to blanket-burrow and chew her yack and bully sticks inside an enclosed (cat?) bed. She's an expert at snatching soft toys tossed up in the air. She's a quick learner and only aims to be good. Lucy is an easy, delicate, sweetheart of a dog.",
