Remi is an extremely loving a boy who seems to be a beautifully colored Carolina mix. At about 2yo Remi is smart and eager to please, which bodes well for his train-ability. He loves being with people and just needs some boundaries and loving- based training, including housebreaking and living in a pack. He adores kids and has the energy to keep up with them! Remi will do best in home with a female dog or alone til he learns better pack manners. Remi is neutered and had his rabies updated, so he only needs the rest of his shots. If you'd like more info on this sweet boy, call 901-619-4654.\n**DO NOT CONTACT DARS - We don't have this animal or any additional info - this is a courtesy listing for the public**\njust needs some boundaries and loving- based training, including housebreaking and living in a pack.",

I\u2019m a 2 year old  terrier mix. My momma Allie was a stray on the streets of Detroit and gave birth to me and 5 other pups out in the bitter cold, but MADR scooped her up along with us babies and literally saved our lives! If it wasn't for MADR we would have froze to death. \n\nI am happy to do anything my humans are doing. I love to play catch, lay next to my foster, chase squirrels and follow my foster around the house. I love treats and peanut butter!! I am a very affectionate guy once I get to know you. I am selective on which dogs I like. I lived with cats when I was younger. I would do best with children 15 years old and older. My forever home is required to have a fenced yard where I can safely run and play. I am neutered, my vaccinations are up to date, I take heartworm preventative every month as well as being house and crate trained. I am a great, guy who loves to have fun, go on adventures and yearns to be part of a forever family.\n\nAll dogs we rescue stay with us until they find their forever homes. We do not do same day adoptions. A home visit is required to ensure our dog is going to a safe environment and our dog gets along with your dog(s) and/or cat(s). We require all our dogs over the age of 1 year old to attend 1 obedience class (6 week session) outside the home. You must live within 1 hour of Birmingham, MI to adopt one of our dogs. No out of state or outside the U.S. adoptions or fosters.  Dancer's adoption fee is $275.",

            "description": "Sam is a 3-year-old Golden Retriever mix. Sam has to have a 6 Foot privacy fence. He can sometimes be apprehensive of strangers, but is easily won over with the right approach. He's super affectionate, loves attention, is playful, and will lay at your feet anytime you need him to chill out with you. Sam's ideal home would be with one or several calm, confident adults. Sam likes to play fetch and play in a fenced yard. He can be a challenge to walk when he sees other dogs or critters. Sam has shared a home with a dog and done ok but it takes slow introductions. Sam is vocal and cannot be adopted to a family living in an apartment or condo with close neighbors. Sam has worked with a few trainers and his new family would need to continue to his training. If you are an approved adopter and are interested in Sam, please contact Jeanine or Lynette. If you are not yet approved but live in SW or Central Florida, please visit www.grrswf.org and fill out an application.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about a GRRSWF dog, please contact us at applications@grrswf.org, or you can read about our adoption process in detail and download an application from our website at http://www.grrswf.org/index-2.html\n\nPLEASE NOTE: We serve Southwest Florida from Naples to Ocala. If you live OUTSIDE of our service area and are interested in adopting one of our dogs, please note that we will only consider an application for senior dogs (over the age of 8) or dogs with special needs (usually medication). BEFORE submitting your application, send an email to info@GRRSWF.org to request an exception to our service area. If that approval is given, you will be asked to complete an application, clearly stating on it that you are interested in a special needs or senior dog. However, please be aware that, unfortunately, there are some locations we simply cannot cover because we do not have sufficient representation in those areas to perform the required home visits prior to the adoption, or follow-up visits afterward. If that is the case, we will be happy to refer you to a local rescue or shelter.\n\n2/2/21 12:03 PM",

We will be trying to catch up over the next two weeks. Suzy is still available and we will be reviewing and responding to her inquiries as soon as possible.  Thanks for your patience! Email is our only communication at the moment.\n\nPLEASE READ BELOW IF INTERESTED IN THIS DOG! \n\nIF YOU ARE SEEING THIS LISTING, THEN THE DOG IS STILL AVAILABLE AND WE ARE PROCESSING INQUIRIES FOR ITS NEW HOME. We remove them immediately once we have stopped taking inquiries and have a pending home.\n\nPLEASE FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS BELOW TO BE CONSIDERED. Please provide a contact phone number! Once we narrow down to the top three candidates, we usually call them to discuss details and then make our choice to meet the dog. Those who send no information about your home or family, or just ask is the dog available, how much, or how old will not be answered. All of that information is listed here and unfortunately, due to the volume of inquiries asking those basic questions, we are unable to answer all of the emails and texts. We also get a lot of people who send in the basic question because of the cute factor and really are not ready to adopt yet.  Please make sure that all of your household members are ready to adopt before pursuing adoption.\n\nWe understand that some of this is due to the new Petfinder format with their basic question at the bottom and apologize for that. In addition we are getting duplicates from most people because of confusion with Petfinder's new system which is making it difficult to tell if your inquiry was sent to us. Also the Petfinder new system asks for a zip code or location but does not forward that to us so we cannot tell your location. We do not fly our animals so please make sure that you are able to drive to Michigan if you are interested in one of our pets.  We are getting a lot of complaints from prospective homes trying to navigate Petfinder's new system and requests from several who enjoyed the various sections of our previous home page.  We cannot do anything about the changes to the format and the removal of the information on our home page, etc. Many people are simply sending their information to us directly at petangels@gmail.com or via text or voicemail to 734-645-7705 which may be a simpler solution at this point.\n\nWe do our best to place our adoptable animals within 1 to 2 weeks if they are ready to go and qualified homes are available. \n\n Please make sure ALL members of your family are in agreement to welcome a new dog to your family and you are ready to meet when you contact us. Thank you for your cooperation so these babies don't continue to grow up in their foster homes and bond to those families.\n\nWe may make our initial contact via text or email but our final candidates will be called when we are making our final decision.  If you have inquired and not provided a phone number yet, please provide one at 734-645-7705.\n\n  If you are just seeing the listing and are interested, please feel free to go ahead and inquire and tell us why you think the pup is a good fit and what it's life would be like if it joins your family. We will take down the listing as soon as the pup is in its new home.\n\nUpdate 2: 6-11-20:\n\nWe are behind and apologize for the slow responses! We will be making calls for Suzy Friday and/or Saturday and hopefully setting her up a meet and greet soon. Thanks for your patience.\n\n2-2-20 Update:\nFINALLY got some pictures of this girl!\n\nPosted 2-12-19:\n\nPictures will be added as soon as we get some good ones but she is camera shy and a fast runner.\n\nSuzy is starting her search for her forever home.  She is estimated to be 7-8 years old although she acts more like 3 to 4 and is very agile! \n\nWe aren't sure of her breed mix but are thinking maybe feist with rat terrier or beagle or something. She is about 25 pounds and has a slender head and pointed nose.\n\nShe is a medium to high energy dog and loves to run and play with other dogs. She is shy at first with humans but follows you around once she's comfortable. \n\nShe is very food motivated and we are working on basic commands. She is a very intelligent dog.\n\nShe has no vet history and is not spayed yet. She will be starting from scratch.\n\nShe is beginning crate training and we are evaluating her housebreaking skills.\n\nIf interested in adopting, please call or text 734-645-7705 and leave your name, location, brief summary of family, work hours, dog experience, training and exercise plans, and a phone contact number. \n\nAdoption fee is $250 (Cash with receipt). If she is not spayed by the time her family finds her, she may be allowed to go to her home on a signed spay agreement to be completed within 30 days at a reduced adoption fee.",

He loves soft toys and is quite the character. Beans has had successful surgery to rid him of bladder stones, so he must stay on a restrictive diet to avoid a re-occurrence. He also has an old injury to his left eye and has no vision in it. Beans is a sedentary fellow who is happy with a low key lifestyle. He is happiest when he knows where you are and will especially follow you if you make your way into the kitchen....his favorite room. Beans sleeps in his own bed and is house trained. He gets along with other dogs and ignores the cat. Mr. Beans, as I refer to him, is a total sweetheart who is looking for a quiet home for his retirement years.",

It\u2019s my favorite thing in the world, I mean other than belly rubs, and I have excellent leash manners. I\u2019m about 4 years old and my foster fam says I\u2019m 50 pounds of pure puppy-love. I love everybody, especially other doggies (any age, any size!). I\u2019m good at playing like a li\u2019l dog around li\u2019l dogs, and like a big dog around big dogs. I\u2019m not sure about cats but maybe a calm, dog savvy feline would be cool.\n\nEven though I\u2019m high-energy on the trail, I can be quiet around the house and cuddly with people I trust. It takes me a little time to warm up to new folks; when I was little, I was left out in a yard all the time and ignored \u2013 me and almost 70 other dogs. I might need to sniff and retreat a few times but I\u2019m more than willing to do a drive by, and once we\u2019re friends, we\u2019re BEST FRIENDS.\n\nMy perfect home would include a playful dog-sibling (or several), a private yard for zoomies, toys to play with, balls to chase, and lots of hikes with my people! I really appreciate exercise but don\u2019t worry if you can\u2019t take me out, I\u2019ll still be a good boy. I\u2019m hoping for a family of patient, active adults, a quiet and child-free environment, and did I mention doggie friends? And belly rubs please. Do you give good belly rubs and like to get outdoors? Then I\u2019m your boy!\n\nSouthern California adopters only please!\n\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/waggingdogrescue/photos_albums\n\nAdoption Application: \nhttps://waggingdog.org/adopt/\n\nWebsite: https://waggingdog.org\nEmail: adoptions@waggingdog.org",

He is very friendly with people he knows and will greet you by wagging his tail so vigorously that his whole body moves with it.  However, he can be wary of strangers.  He loves to go on walks and especially enjoys playing fetch.  He will play this game all day long if you have the energy to keep up with him.  Brokk has been around other dogs but will probably do best as an only dog.  He is looking for a loving home that has experience with shy, sensitive dogs.\n\nBrokk has the potential to be a happy, confident dog in the hands of an adopter that can help him be the best dog he can be.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "description": "Meet Axel a young Great Pyrenees who had a hard life before coming into rescue. He was kept chained with little shelter and no human interaction and was abandoned when his owners moved. He has not let that stop him and is thriving in his foster home! If you are looking for that typical Pyrenees personality, look no further as Axel is your boy. He takes his job as guard dog very seriously and insists on doing the full perimeter check every night, sleeps by the door to ward off any intruders, and loves to lay outside. Axel loves to play with all the female foster dogs in his home and even ignores the small ones when they bark at him. His foster mom says he gets a perplexed look on his face as if he is trying to figure out what that little five pound furball is barking at :) Axel is housebroken, rides great in a car, and walks nicely on a leash. He is the full package...has a Pyrfect personality, gets along with every dog he meets, is good with cats, and loves people. Axel would love a home with other dogs to play with, and a family who will love him for the rest of his days!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nNGPR dogs are in foster homes throughout the U.S., NOT Beacon, NY.  View full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.\n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.\n\n",

Dutchess came to the Animal Care League as a transfer from a local shelter where she was confiscated as a cruelty case. Once we heard Dutchess's story and met her this sweet girl, we knew we had to help her find her forever home. Dutchess is understandably scared when she initially meets people, especially men - But once this sweet girl meets you properly she is just all snuggles and fun. Dutchess has spent time in foster which confirmed that she loves other dogs and they really help her lose all of her worries and just be a carefree dog. We absolutely love this girl and we think you will too. If you are interested in meeting our resident royalty please fill out an application!",

His favorite pastime is snuggling up with his favorite person on a comfy couch or bed.  Captain Jack loves belly rubs best of all!

            "description": "MAVERICK has rejoined AABR and is looking for just the right family. Maverick is about 7-8 years old but he has all of the spirit of a young dog. He knows his basic commands and will do best with a skilled owner who will give him lots of mental and physical work outs along with a structured home. Mav is a fantastic cuddle buddy and will be a devoted companion to his people. And his goofy personality will definitely keep you amused. If you are looking for fun pup in life Mav is your boy! \n\nMaverick is house trained, would do best as an only dog, no cats. He\u2019s a smart dog and will take very quickly to training. Could you be a perfect Valentine for Mav? \n.\n\nIf you are interested in MAVERICK or any of our dogs, you must live with a 40 mile radius of the Downtown Cincinnati, OH area. Please go to www.adoreabull.org/interested to learn how to start an adoption process.\n\nIf you have questions on why we restrict our adoption area, please go to http://adoreabull.org/interested/adoption-radius/\n#adoptable #adoptme #dogsofcincy #cincy #cincygram #bullyrescue #pitbull #adoptdontshop",

I like to chase cats so those may not be a good idea for me to have as siblings. I ended up at animal control as a stray and for some reason my family never came for me. But my foster mom saw me and fell in love so did I! But I was heart worm positive. No worries my mom said we would get rid of them ......and we did. I am now heart worm negative, on prevention, neutered, UTD on all vaccines and microchipped. All I need now is a family of my own!",

He does well with other confident dogs that are leaders and not submissive. His human adopters must have the following qualities to be considered: Strong, dominant leaders who will continue obedience courses as well as enroll him in additional courses such as agility training.\n\nWe are only considering active families who enjoy and participate in outdoor sports and activities that will include Max in all their fun and adventure such as camping, hiking, etc. The person or family has a social lifestyle where Max can interact with a variety of people and other dogs. Will be willing to have assessments by our trainer to make sure that Max\u2019s training regimen is on track, so that he will not revert back to his nervous state, and feed him high quality and healthy food that is specifically designed for an active and young dog. \n\nIf you are looking for a dog that fits Max\u2019s description and feel you would be a good fit, please fill out an adoption questionnaire on the Forte Animal Rescue website. \n\n[Max is 2 years old and weighs 37 lbs.]\n\n(1902/1909)",

He is up to date and on slow kill treatment for heartworms which is covered by the rescue!\nTank is a very sweet boy. He loves all people and is good with children. He loves going on long walks and is really good riding in the car. He is house trained and let you know when he is ready to go out. He might be better in a home where he is the only dog. However he does get along with a few dogs. It is hit and miss. He will not destroy your house when you leave he has never chewed up anything!!\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our dogs are healthy, spayed/neutered, vaccinated and on heartworm preventative. They live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. Many have basic obedience skills and all have been temperament tested. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, please visit our website to complete an application: http://www.takepawsrescue.org/adoption-form\n(please note: app cannot be done on a mobile device)\n\nIf you have any questions, please email us at adopt@takepawsrescue.org",

She needs an active family that keep her busy and exercised. Star needs a home with NO cats, and this pretty little lady prefers the company of male dogs only. If you would like to make this sweet girl a part of your family, fill out an application at www.barktownrescue.org.\nSTAR'S ADOPTION FEE IS $150The shelter software system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of our dogs we are only guessing at the dog's predominant breed or breed mix. We strongly encourage you to select your new pet by looking at each dog's individual personality and pet qualities rather than relying on a breed label that is only our best guess.\n\nOur adoption fees vary from $150 and up. All of our dogs are up to date on vaccines, heart worm preventives, and flea/tick medication, and will be spayed/neutered prior to adoption. Portions of your adoption fee also help care for the sick and injured animals that we take in. Thank you for supporting us and considering a rescue dog!",

Lucky was adopted from the shelter and the surrendered back to the same shelter because the family said that he didn't like men and bit a man. We believe it must have been the particular person he didn't like because he's a love with everyone here. Lucky is a healthy boy and is neutered, up to date on vaccines, and microchipped. He just had his first hea\nrtworm treatment today and will have to have a second treatment in 1 to 2 months. He will fully recover from his heart worms. Lucky will need an adopter close enough to be able to bring him back to our vet, Clover Vet Clinic in SC for his second treatment as it is already paid for there. His adoption fee is a $200 donation and covers all of his vetting. Here is the link to our application, https://toolkit.rescuegroups.org/of/f?c=YSHTKGDY\n\n11/10/20 1:58 PM",

I am about two years old and my coloring is brown. \n\nI was in a hoarding situation with way too many dogs, and so I haven\u2019t had a good start in life. I am very mistrustful when you first meet me because of my past living situation. When I first arrived at my foster home, I didn\u2019t go near anyone. But my foster mom kept picking me up and having me sit in her lap while she petted me. That was kind of nice, and now I go sit by her on my own and I have even crawled in her lap!\n\nStrangers are frightening, but my foster mom is working with me to teach me that not all people are bad or scary. If you adopt me, you will have to be patient with me. I want to learn to love and trust, but it will take time. My foster mom says your patience with me will be well worth it because I am a sweet boy. My vaccinations are all up to date and I am working on being fully housetrained. I am also neutered.\n\nYou can meet me or learn more about me by contacting JAN at crazy4mutts@outlook.com. I\u2019m being fostered in the El Cajon area of San Diego County.\n",

Diva is good with other dogs and cats but is leary of people.  She is not a cuddler, but we think in time she could be.  Diva wants to warm up to people but is not sure of them.  We think with the right family she will learn to trust.  She comes by foster mom and likes to be petted and have her butt scratched but she still does not like to be held.  Foster mom picks her up in a towel but she is not happy about it. Diva is getting a dental on January 6 and will be available after that.   Diva needs a special loving home\n\nDiva's adoption fee includes his/her 1st grooming/bath, spay/neuter, rabies and distemper vaccinations, fecal, heartworm tests, flea/tick treatment if required, microchip, collar, and any other vet care that's required during his/her stay with us.  Adoption Fee is:  Donation\n\nPlease fill out an application at cryforhelprescue.com if you are interested in meeting Diva\n\nSee all our adoptable dogs and fill out an online application now at http://www.cryforhelprescue.com.

We discovered Darwin at Fulton Animal Services, where he took our breath away. At 4, he's a XL lab-mystery mix guy who is just stunning in person. He was adopted for a few months but recently came back to PAWS Atlanta, where we're hoping to find a better fit for him. Darwin's one challenge lately is that he has shown some resource guarding tendencies around food. This is common and can usually be corrected with some consistent training. We can help get you both on the right track and put you in touch with some excellent resources in the area. Because of the food guarding issue, we want Darwin to go to an adult home, preferably one where he can get some daily exercise and activities that will challenge his mind. We are crazy about this sweet lug and would love to tell you more about Darwin. Come by and take him out for a walk on our trail.",

            "description": "If you are looking for 100 lbs of lap dog, then you absolutely have to meet our guy Jake, a 3 year old super nice Pyr mix. This sweet boy is a big fan of snuggles and cuddles and just about anything else he gets to do with his people. Jake has flourished with love and attention since being in his foster home. He is a completely different pupper than the skinny scared guy who first came into rescue. Jake is now extremely outgoing, curious, and loving. He\u2019s very gentle in all situation and patient when it comes to waiting for his turn at treat time. Jake also loves hanging out with dogs, and is great with all size pups from tiny to extra large. But at the end of the day, his favorite place is wherever his human family members are. He REALLY enjoys any and all attention. In fact, if you even look at him long enough he will melt like butter at your feet with all paws in the air and a belly ready for rubs! His foster mom says he LOVES LOVES LOVES to cuddle and has the most adorable soft snore. Just like meeting new people, Jake has never met a snack he doesn\u2019t like :) And as far as looks go, Jake definitely stands out in a crowd. Between those beautiful markings, one shorter ear, and that super expressive face, he\u2019s nearly irresistible. Being food motivated helps with training and so far he walks well using his harness, has mastered the sit command, and is crate trained (he's also learned lots of new tricks including a kangaroo impression). Jake is just an all around love and would bring years of joy to any family who opens their home to him - his foster wants to see him adopted to a home that will love him as much as they do!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nView full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.\n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.\n\n",

Bella is vetted, potty trained, she's silly and perfection in the home. She loves exploring on walks and chasing after little bunnies. She's smart, very loyal, and loves car rides.\n\nShe has been in a few foster homes since we rescued her from Carson shelter a couple years ago. Her ideal home would be quiet, where she can bask in the sun, enjoy her yard, love on her humans and be the center of attention. She does need to be the only dog, since that's where she's happiest.\n\nBella is a gorgeous pup who is affectionate and just amazing. She has the sweetest disposition and is a total love. Bella is looking for a forever home and a family she can love and protect. If you think she would be a great addition to your pack, please submit a completed application a www.doggiebonez.com, so that we can schedule a meet and greet. She is also on all of our social media pages IG: @Doggie_Bonez_Inc_ and Facebook: Doggie Bonez.\n\nIf adoption isn't an option, please consider fostering one of our pups. We are a volunteer run non-profit dog rescue and always welcome new short and/or long term doggie foster families. We greatly appreciate the help and time of our fosters. You provide all the love, comfort and safety of a home and we supply you with everything else you may need, dog food, dog bed, toys, medical attention (if needed) etc. If you are interested please visit www.doggiebonez.com to see all of our available dogs who need a foster family while waiting for their fur-ever home and complete the foster application.",

Briggs does have some separation anxiety issues, but is a lovable dog that doesn't know a stranger. He was a shelter favorite, and is a volunteer favorite at Peace. He comes with his adoption fee SPONSORED, and 3 training sessions in his new home to help ensure that the transition is as smooth as possible. Please give Briggs a second glance. He may just be the perfect guy for your home! <3\n\nBriggs, Big Dave, Mushy Face, has been with us since February and we aren't sure why he hasn't received much interest! He is 3-4 years old and a bigger boy, at approximately 75-80 pounds. We don't see any problems with this though, because there is just more to love!\n\nAnd love he does. Briggs is incredibly people friendly. As big and intimidating as he may look, he is the type of dog to approach a stranger with a full body wag and kisses. All he wants in life is all the pats and butt scritchies. His big ol' head is perfect for smushing and head pets.\n\nHe is dog friendly and was a playgroup rock star! He currently lives splendidly with a female pit in his foster home. He can get a little excited when he's unable to greet another dog, but he is easily redirected! He is a big, friendly guy and just wants to meet all the people and dogs. He is child friendly, and generally very affectionate. Apply to adopt him today!\n\nABOUT PEACE 4 PITS RESCUE:\nPlease note that we do not have a facility or shelter where you can view adoptables. We are a foster-based rescue in Chicago-land, which means that each dog is placed with a family in the area. This allows us to better understand each dog's individual personalities. \n\nYou must complete an application before you can schedule a meet and greet with each animal. The application can be found here: http://peaceforpits.org/adoptionfoster-application/ or if you prefer a Word version, download it here: https://goo.gl/bKo84P and email it to p4papplications@gmail.com. Our adoption fee is typically $350 for an adult dog, and $400 for a dog under one year. It includes all vetting and spay/neuter.",

            "description": "Carmelo is so ridiculously hunky and cute. He's 8.5 years old so this lug nut is a little more mellow than most, but can still kick himself into \"play\" gear pretty quickly. Carmelo LOVES being outside on walks and getting a break from the shelter. He is friendly with people, all people, including the little ones. He's not keen on other dogs. We think he's a Catahoula Leopard dog mix, and he has the most beautiful eyes. We fell in love with his sweet smile. Carmelo would love to have a stable home, where he can relax and feel like he's part of the family. He is a low-maintenance guy who doesn't need to be fussed over. But, he loves a little attention and he's big on bellyrubs. If you're looking for a confident, well-adjusted family dog, please consider Carmelo. He's been waiting patiently for someone to notice him, and he wakes up every day wondering if this is the day he'll finally get to go home.",

            "description": "Meet Hobie. He\u2019s a sweet and gentle young boy who somehow ended up in the shelter. Lucky for Hobie, he was recently invited to stay with one of our veteran fosters for a few days. While he was really scared of things like the TV and vacuum at first, he has quickly adjusted to the new surroundings. Hobie has nice house manners, is housebroken, knows a few commands and stays off the furniture.\n\nHobie seems to like people and other dogs, so a doggie buddy might help him gain confidence. He walks very nicely on leash too. And most of all, Hobie is super-duper cute!\nPlease visit http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/ to learn more about our dogs. Click on available dogs to see further descriptions. If you are interested in me, please contact us at information@coastalgsrsd.org or call (858) 779-9149. Don't forget to fill out our online application:  http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/webform/1774/adoption-application. The minimum adoption donation ranges from $300 to $400. This amount only partially covers the cost of veterinary care, boarding fees, and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs and is 100%2tax deductible. Prior to placement, all dogs will be spayed or neutered, receive current vaccinations, and are usually microchipped. If not, arrangements will be made on an individual basis. Special consideration may be given to those willing to adopt older dogs or dogs with physical problems. Our adoption process begins with completing an application on-line. A phone screening will soon follow, and lastly a home visit will be conducted by our volunteers.",

We take animals that have been tortured, abused, and neglected and supply the emergency medical care required to get them well. We then provide rehab physically and mentally to prepare them for their new home and new life. We are located in Ridgeland, SC., and are by appointment only. All of our dogs are at our Rehabilitation Center either in hospice care or being loved on by staff until we find them forever homes. Please call 843.540.6755 or email NoahsArksRescues@mac.com with any questions. If you are interested, please fill out our Adoption Application at https://www.noahs-arks.net/nar-application.

She is a great gal, and would do best in a home as either the only dog, or with a mellow male where she can gain her confidence. China is wonderful in her crate, does need a little leash work but is eager to please and happy to be by your side :) Please fill out an application today to meet China!\n\n**This is a facilitated adoption**\n\nPlease consider sponsoring China with either a one-time or monthly tax-deductible donation.

I\u2019m a white with gray spots pittie mix, some people might consider me a bit of a low rider, whatever, I have the best personality!!  I weigh about 55 lbs, and am super athletic, (if I do say so myself).  I love to be active, am very energetic I love all humans, but because of my exuberance it\u2019s probably best that I go to a home with kiddos 12 and up.  \nNow as much as I love, love all humans, I don\u2019t feel the same way about the feline species, so no cats please.  I like male dogs, but I can be selective, (what self-respecting female isn\u2019t??) so please let\u2019s do a proper meet and greet!\nI\u2019m house trained, crate trained and clicker trained\u2026.whew, that\u2019s a lot of training!!  But it goes to show you how smart I am!!\nNot to brag, but\u2026..I of course know sit, stay,  down, paw\u2026.I can touch a target, \u201clook at me\u201d, walking gently on a leash, jumping over ~1 foot obstacles, and of course climbing up ramp obstacles, I can stay in a sit, give paw or run right up and down\u2026whatever you tell me to do. Have you seen my pictures on top of the ramp?  You know not every dog will even go up them\u2026.just sayin\u2019 ?\n I really am a quick study and I so want to please you\u2026.\nDo you have room in your home and heart for me?  By the way, I\u2019m super duper soft\u2026.and would love to snuggle with you!

            "description": "Last Weigh-in: 51 lbs\n\nFoster updates:\nUma will do well in a home with older children and without other dogs. \n\n\u201cUma is happy and loving. Coy! Always down for cuddles and pets. In love with her crate. Puts herself to bed every night at approximately 9:30pm... unless she\u2019s in a party mood. Uma has not been tested with cats or children yet.\n\nUma is extremely affectionate and meeting new people is her favorite thing in the world. She is constantly itching for human companionship and would sit in your lap and give you kisses all day if you\u2019d let her. She listens well, is very eager to please and is typically very gentle and calm but also gets excited for walks outside. Sadly, she hasn\u2019t always been treated well by humans and she will cower at sudden movements or loud noises. However, she is getting more confident with each day and with each new person she meets who show her only affection. It\u2019s incredible how a dog who was treated so poorly by people can still love them so much!\u201d\n\nUma is Crate Trained, Leash trained, Slightly active, Does well in a car, Likes toys, Obedient, Playful, Affectionate, Goofy & Gentle\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nUma\u2019s Story\n For several years, I was owned by some men, used as a breeding dog, and tethered in a backyard.  I've had a pup companion named Ethan for a while now (he's my best friend and a new Streetdog too!) But that was the only life I ever known. Last September, I stopped receiving food from my \"\"owners\"\" because they didn't want to pay for it anymore, and I withered away to almost nothing. I had laid down in the hot sun and became very weak. I nearly decided that it was my time to go, but some people were passing by, approached me, and brought me food and water. They began visiting me everyday for months to try to gain my trust. I stayed as far as I could, because I didn't know that humans could be kind, but slowly, day by day, they always came back. They always spoke kindly to me, they always brought food, some toys and even some blankets when it started getting cold.  \n\n A few weeks ago, the lights in the house that I \"belonged to\" got shut off for good and all signs of \"my owners\" were gone. I had been abandoned officially. But the neighbors kept coming and kept visiting.  They started searching for rescue help.  When it got below freezing these past few weeks, they loaded me in a car and took me to a vet for boarding. This was as much help as my neighbor friends could offer and I will always be grateful to them. It's the first vet care I have ever received. I got some shots, my first bath, and got spayed.  We found out that I am heartworm positive.   Streetdog Foundation was contacted about my situation and came and scooped me and my friend, Ethan, up.  \n\nWe are now meeting new human and pup friends, and learning moe about kindness and trust. I'm a little shy at first, but once I love, I love BIG! I was born around 1/25/2013 and on my way to beating these pesky heartworms and officially becoming adoptable. So far I LOVE car rides, and I love booty scratches and hugs. Leashes and stairs are still kinda scary to me but I think I'll end up liking those soon! I have soulful eyes and a big silly grin and can't wait to find out what it is like to live inside a house! So if you can foster me or even better, adopt me, I would love to meet you!\n\nMedical Update: Uma has successfully completed her heartworm treatment.\n\nBehaviors not listed have yet to be tested.",

            "description": "Last weigh-in: 73.6 lbs\n\nMeet Babar Bear! Late 2018 Streetdog was informed of a family living on the streets of Memphis. While there were originally 9 puppies plus Mom & Dad it seemed there were only 4 of the  puppies remaining with Mom & Dad. We snatched up the hairless little puppies (#sdfBabyElephants) right away and treated them for heavy mange. Mom & Dad, now #sdfRella & #sdfBabarBear, were much more street savvy and elusive. Took a bit of time but in January 2019, with a little bit of luck, a lot of patience and some Pirtles Chicken,  our vigilant volunteers were finally able to pick the pair up. \n\nMay 18th update: Babar has completed heartworm treatment and has been neutered.\n\nFoster Update: One word\u2026GOOFY! This boy is something else! He\u2019s been used to living on the street is whole life but you would never know it. Fits right in! He is the sweetest of the sweet. Loves to play with other pups and be a part of a pack. His heart is so clearly full of love. The happiest and most goofy pup I\u2019ve ever met! He\u2019s a perfect little nub in his crate.  Sleeps with me and my two dogs, at night,  sans crate perfectly. Truly a beautiful, low-key and amazing boy! He was neutered in  May and has completed heart-worm treatment. Healthy as can be! If we did not have 4 dogs this boy would be mine! Anyone that ends up with this precious boy will be so lucky!",

I will be five soon and I weigh a trim 85 lbs. I am in the prime of my life and will be make a delightful companion for the right person.  I am looking for the right situation with a foster or adopter who will believe in me and help me overcome my fears. I should be an only dog, though I might get along with a submissive male after proper introductions. A cat companion would be fine. I am also slow to trust so when I first meet you, I might bark at you. You may think I don\u2019t like you but take me for a walk and you will be my new best friend! I love to play with sticks and balls outside. Right now I am not that comfortable around new people but I will be very loving once I get to know you. Trust is an issue for me because of my previous life with people, especially children not being kind to me, so there should be no small children in your home. If you think you might like to be my special person, there are many people supporting me and they would love for you to meet me!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nView full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.\n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.\n\n",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Please contact Lynn & Cedric (lynnwelcomesyouhome@gmail.com) for more information about this pet. All of our dogs and cats are in foster homes and we have no paid staff. If you have questions concerning a specific animal, PLEASE fill out an application and the foster parent will be in touch. We will not arrange any home visits with any of our dogs and cats until your application is processed. Please understand our foster parents are precious to our 2nd Chance family; without them we cannot function, so we do our best to not burden them with multiple appointments. Our foster parents will choose their top 3 applications and arrange home visits with these applicants. The adopter will be chosen at that time. The process can take anywhere from a week to a month. We want to make sure our little furry ones are placed in their 'forever home' and never have to go through a rehoming again!UPDATE - Nick has been diagnosed with Addisons. He will be on meds the rest of his life. Cost is about $250 per month. He feels so great after his monthly shot. You will have to watch him closely as his levels can tank rather quickly.Hi! My name is Nick. I guess you would like to know a little about me and my story. I somehow found myself in a high kill shelter a few months ago. After a few days in the shelter when no one came to get me, they put a slip on my kennel that said I was next to be euthanized if more dogs came into the shelter. Luckily a nice shelter worker contacted 2nd Chance 4 Life and my new foster mom and her friend drove 7 hours each way to come get me! I was so happy to be out of the loud shelter that I slept like a baby the entire way home! As you can tell I am on the older side, but don't let that deter you. I have been told by everyone I meet that I am a sweet old soul. I love curling up into a little ball and sleeping on anything comfy. Did I mention I like to sleep A LOT? I am most happy on a nice warm couch next to my human. I get scared and anxious when I am home alone, and would prefer if someone would stay home with me during the day! Maybe an older soul like me will give me a chance and all the snuggles I could ever want! I like other dogs, and they seem to like me too. I am house trained, I can sit, shake with both paws, and come on command. Please give me a chance to show you that old dogs are just as fun and loving as a young puppy. You wont regret it! - NickPlease fill out an adoption application:\nAdoption application (Dog)\nAdoption Application (Cat)\n\nPlease understand we do not adopt out dogs to\nfamilies with children under the age of 5. We do not adopt dogs to renters. Some dogs will have fence requirements while others may not.\n\nA pet is a lifetime commitment. The dogs and cats in our system find themselves there, for the most part, because their humans did not have the same loyalty to them as they did to their owners. We do not take the adoption process lightly, and will do everything in our power to make sure the animal is placed correctly the first time around for your sake and theirs. Thank you for choosing to adopt not shop!",

            "description": "Gino is a friendly, affectionate Lab/Pittie mix who is 6+ years old and weighs 65 lbs.  He loves people, has good leash manners, likes to go for walks, and knows his basic commands.  He is an energetic, playful, mature boy who enjoys getting head rubs and giving kisses.  Due to no fault of his own, Gino was surrendered to an overcrowded shelter with his companion Mona (who is also available for adoption through BarkVille Dog Rescue).  Fortunately, BarkVille was able to save them, but Gino needs an IMMEDIATE FOSTER or ADOPTER to get him out of boarding.  He received medical care for his eye and while he is most likely blind in it, it does not seem cause him any discomfort.  However, because of his age and limited sight, we think he may be best suited to a home with no other dogs and mature adults.  He is housebroken, crate trained, neutered, fully vaccinated & microchipped.\n\nFor more information about Gino, please email us at info@barkvilledogrescue.org. If you would like to adopt Gino, please submit an adoption application for him at https://www.barkvilledogrescue.org/adoption-application.",

We want the very best for all of the dogs and therefore recommend adopters interested in Pumpkin, participate in the private training workshops we offer to help prepare dog and owner for a smooth transition and happy forever home! \n\nMeet Pumpkin, a very petite and beautiful female redbone coonhound. This girl is looking for a home that will understand her unique needs. Pumpkin is a sensitive girl and is very scared of storms. She also has separation anxiety.  She takes medicine to help her relax, but she does best when she can have a dedicated safe spot or just be with the person/people she trusts. With time, she has gained confidence in her foster home and is doing much better. We encourage potential adopters to work with us to ensure that we can help her succeed in her forever home.\n\nThis girl is currently in a foster home with other dogs and cats. She is respectful around kitties. She has been around small and large dogs and is super playful and occasionally bossy. \n\nPumpkin is looking for a home that will give her guidance and leadership so she can feel secure and confident. This girl is ready to go to a home and give kisses \n\nPumpkin shines when she has people that help show her the appropriate way to act in situations- when to give kisses (and she LOVES to give kisses to her fav people!) and when to trust a new person. We are happy to work with interested adopters and Pumpkin and share all the many things we adore about this girl! Ask us for more info!\n\nPumpkin is spayed, up to date on vaccines, and housebroken. We require an adoption application, home visit, and adoption fee. Want more info? Email mastiffmojo@msn.com. Thanks! \n",

This 9-year-old Golden spent her pre-RAGOM years in a commercial breeding facility and had no experience of a normal life, making her extremely shy and wary of any changes.\n\nWith guidance and reassurance from her foster pack, Cara is learning to appreciate the good life and taking small steps out of her shell every day. She will need another large, confident dog in her forever home to ensure a successful transition and to facilitate with her training. And to keep her safe and free from stress, we are requiring a home with a physically fenced yard and children in the home must be 10+.\n\nTo learn more about Cara see her bio at: https://ragom.org/dogs/cara-18-153\n\nPlacement Requirements:\nGood With Dogs: Yes\nGood With Cats: Not Tested\nGood With Kids: 10+\nFence: Physical Fence Required\nAge: 9\n\nIf you are interested in any of the dogs available at Retrieve a Golden of the Midwest (RAGOM), you can read our adoption process and apply to adopt, which can be found at https://ragom.org/our-adoption-process.

They were in a small wire enclosure that had no shelter and there was no food or water.\n\nWe took them in and they are now vetted and were lucky enough to find a wonderful foster home where they could stay together. Amazingly, they are great in the house and with the kids. They are truly bonded and need to stay together but they are small and calm.

Marty is very curious and likes to follow his humans around the house because he simply wants to spend time with the family. He is dog friendly, but requires a proper intro to new dogs. Marty does love kids, we recommend 10-12 years or older. He's also fully house trained, neutered, and up to date on shots. He doesn't like cats, but they are weird so we can't blame him lol. Marty has a laid back demeanor and rarely barks, but he also loves to run and chase a ball. Did I mention he has the cutest head tilt you've ever seen? Please consider meeting Marty, he would love to find his furever family!\n\nYou can complete an adoption application by visiting our website www.RockABullyAF.com and then \"Adopters\". The adoption application is mobile, tablet, and computer friendly. Message us if you have any questions!",

            "description": "MEET NEVILLE! Nevlle is a male American Rescue with similarities to a lab/terrier mix. He weighs 70 lbs, stands 18 inches at the shoulder and his estimated birthyear is 2017. He is very people oriented and loves belly rubs. He is also very strong, so will need an adopter who can handle a big, strong dog. He is good with his kennel mate, but needs a slow intro with new dogs, so a home where he is the only pet would be best. Neville is fully vetted, up to date on his shots and neutered. If you would like to give Neville a forever home, please fill out our online application at CorinthAlcornAnimalRescue.com.",

            "description": "Meet Noelle! She is a 6 year old Hound mix who is a very sweet girl. She loves to play with her foster siblings and is good with other dogs, usually deferring to them if she doesn't know them. She is a bit reserved when she first meets new humans but once she warms up she is a happy goofy girl who loves wrestling and toys. She is energetic at play but also knows how to chill - she just enjoys hanging out with you! Noelle is kennel and house trained and has a great temperament for being a solo dog or a member of a pack. Because she is a hound, she would likely not be suitable for apartment dwelling.\n\nIf you would like to meet Noelle please go to www.newbestfriend.org and submit an adoption application. Our adoption fee is $250 + sales tax and includes spay, vaccinations and microchip.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: We do not adopt outside the Greater Houston area.",

He is great with other dogs, house and crate trained.  Scout is terrified of storms and will hide or try to get under you to hide.  In good weather he is much better about going outside and playing.  He would most likely do well in a home with a female owner and/or females in the home and best in home with no young children.  He is current on his vaccines, microchipped and neutered.\n\nAdoption fee: (Cash/Check) $175 (Credit/Debit) $180. This includes vet care and vaccines up until adoption, spaying/neutering, and microchip. If you are interested in this wonderful pet, please complete an online application at sqrescueinc.org. Your application must be approved prior to meeting our dogs outside of our scheduled adoption events. Incomplete or missing information will delay processing your application.

This little boy has clearly been with us a long time and it's because he is need of a special home who will give him the time to feel safe loved and develop a routine. We want so desperately for him to have a loving family, but we know that in this busy world, we are asking a lot. We are holding out hope that somewhere there is someone that is the right fit. \n\nLook at that smile! Wally is one happy boy - rescued with his two siblings, Willy & Waltz, Willy has gone on to find a loving and patient home while Waltz has became part of our sanctuary family because his fear of new people is so strong. That leaves Wally. We believe that Wally is capable of finding a family and we won't give up. He has no aggression whatsoever, but is timid with anything new. Once he learns the ropes, he's good to go which is why we must keep trying. Rescued in 2018 at approximately 3 weeks of age from a Burger King garden area.  His condition was poor, but look at him now.  Wally is shy at first meeting, but warms up with time and routine. He is currently in training learning to trust a bit more quickly.

Donations are always welcome to help with her medical bills.\n\nHi, my name is Kiera and I am an 8 year old lab/pit mix.  I am the biggest love bug and I love to snuggle and cuddle.  I walk well on a leash and I am house trained.  I get along with medium to large dogs but I chase cats, squirrels, rabbits and small dogs.  I know the sit and come command.  I will come quickly with the rattle of a bag.  Lol!  My foster home gave me a big soft bed but I chose the smaller soft bed because I like to curl up tight when I sleep.  I will require a fenced yard at my new forever home.  I love running and bouncing off leash in a fenced yard with the biggest smile on my face.  I still have some spunk for a senior girl.  If you are looking for a companion who likes to go for walks and snuggle next to you on the sofa while we watch TV then I'm your girl!  Please consider giving me a chance.  You can complete an application at www.safeanimalhaven.org.  Thank you!",

She had mammary tumors on both sides, she had surgery to remove them all and now our sweet girl is sitting in boarding. A cancer survivor deserves better, she deserves a loving home, warm bed and all the walks she wants. Can you give that to her?\n\nMiranda is 8 years young, she is in very good health overall. Her tumors were removed (she has the long s\ncars to prove it) and we got all the cancer with good margins. She is fabulous on the leash, loves her walks (she is up to 45 minutes), she knows basic commands, is house trained and loves every person she meets. Miranda would do best as an only dog as she gets stressed sharing a home. We believe it was from the over breeding she was subjected to. She is fine with dogs out on walks, she does pack walks everyday.\n\nEmail dogs@labradorsandfriends.org or fill out our online application at\nwww.labradorsandfriends.org\nMiranda is located in Southern California.\n\nIn the Beginning: Our sweet senior from the Riverside Shelter has had both her mastectomies and she is now ready to get into a foster or forever home!! Miranda is a LOVE!! She still has zip in her step and loves to go on walks (and hanging out and giving kisses to people!) We want to get Miranda into a home as soon as possible, she deserves it after all she has been through. Miranda would do best in a \"only dog\" home. She is house trained and great on the leash!\n\nMiranda is a SWEET, 9 year old girl who was in danger of euthanasia at the Riverside Shelter because she is a senior. We pulled her yesterday and took her right to our vet for the senior work up. The good news, her blood work and chest x-rays look good, the bad news, she has 3 mammary tumors that need to be removed. It appears our sweet girl has already had a few removed as she is missing a couple of nipples. We want to get the tumors removed ASAP! We\nneed to raise $1000 to cover her surgery and biopsy. Please help us help this sweet, sweet girl!!",

She's 3 years old and absolutely adores spending time with children! Her foster home has several children who she just can't get enough of. She's a gentle girl who is deaf and needs a loving family who can keep her safe. Dolly would do best in a home with a calm, submissive dog or no dogs at all. It takes a bit for her to trust other dogs so slow intros are necessary. She's house trained and kennel trained too. Although she would love having a fenced yard, she cannot be left alone as she has been known to climb fences! If you feel this sweet love bug would be a pawfect match for your family, please submit an adoption application to schedule a time to meet her! She can't wait to meet you!\n\nThe adoption fee for this pretty girl is $150. She has been spayed, microchipped and is up to date on vaccines!\n\nWant to meet Dolly? Submit an adoption application and someone will be in touch to schedule a meet n greet to see if shes the right match for you!",

He bunks with a fairly fractious female Dobie and he defers to her. At the time of his neutering in October, 2018, he weighed 73 pounds, and he's 7 years old.",

            "description": "What a gorgeous hunk Rusty is! He is a sweet and active 4 year old boy who likes other dogs but can be rough with little dogs ~ he likes to tug and run. He walks well on a leash but you need a strong hand when it comes to meeting other dogs on a walk. He wants to be friendly but he is like a bull in a china shop. He LOVES walks and they are very necessary to tire him out for sleeping at night. Although Rusty gets along with dogs his size, he would be fine as an only dog also - just make sure that he gets plenty of exercise. Rusty MUST be fed separately and not allowed to roam when other dogs in the house are eating. He is gentle taking treats from you but he wants everyone else\u2019s treats or food and that can cause fights. He will try and steal your food also, so best to keep him separated when you are eating. Rusty will need to continue to remain on his prescription food. Rusty is housebroken but NEEDS a consistent schedule. The crate has been very good for him. His new family must understand that he goes out immediately after meals and playtime. Rusty is a good boy but cannot be in a home with children since he plays rough and is HIGHLY food aggressive. He would be fine in a home with teenagers or older who understand and can respect Rusty\u2019s space, with his issues. If you have the perfect home for Rusty, please fill out an Adoption Application.\n",

He has been thru treatment for the mange and his hair is starting to grow in and cover the bald places. He is also up to date on all of his vaccinations, heartworm negative, and on heartworm preventative. Lucas is about 14 inches tall and came in to rescue weighing around 14 pounds. Lucas is a happy go lucky puppy that has just gotten into a foster home and we will be learning more about him, his personality and what he knows.\n\nUPDATE: Lucas is over his case of sarcoptic mange and after noticing that the fur was not growing back on his face and feet we took him to a dermatologist. It was determined that Lucas may have what is commonly called collie nose or DM (Dermatomyositis). It is not contagious but a genetic issue that effects a small percentage of shelties and collies. Here is a website with information concerning DM: http://www.illinoissheltierescue.com/dm.html . Lucas is a sweet well behaved sheltie mix. He is house trained and crate trained and has excellent house manners. He loves to go on walks and interacts well with other dogs and with people he meets on those walks. We took him to Barnes and Noble when we were gift wrapping at Christmas and he was a wonderful ambassador meeting and smoozing with all of the visitors. He is currently around 9 years old and is looking for his forever home. He would love an active home as he loves to run and play with toys. He also gets along well with small children and other dogs.",

            "description": "Forest is a super precious pup who just loves to have fun!    He's a 2 year old, 50 pound bundle of love.  He loves  belly rubs and is super-duper friendly!!  He could play all day long chasing a ball or fetching a stick.  He loves other dogs, kids, and pretty much all humans.    Sweet Forest was rescued as an abandoned dog and is so thankful to have humans to take care of him, but what he really wants is his very own family.   This precious boy deserves his very own yard to play in & his very own people.     Won't you be his forever family to love him and let him be your faithful and loyal boy pup?   He will add so much joy to some very lucky family!\n\nLike many rescue pups, this furbaby is HW+, but is currently undergoing the *slow-kill method of treatment (see more information below).  \n\nAll our adoption fees include spay/neuter, micro-chip, up-to-date vaccinations, including rabies thru date of adoption. This pup is heartworm positive and is currently being treated with the *slow kill method, approved by her veterinarian, on prevention & on flea/tick prevention. \n\n*The slow kill method of treatment, simply stated, is a 30 day regiment of  doxycycline followed by a monthly dose of Advantage Multi for 12 months, then retesting.   Most dogs test negative after one year of following this treatment; however, we always recommend that potential adopters consult & follow the advice of their family veterinarian upon adopting any of our hw+ pups.   Although the fast-kill method is still considered the \"gold-standard\" by the AVA, and may be preferred by some vets; the slow-kill method has proven to be effective in our rescue. The main reason we utilize this method is due to our limited financial constraints and the high number of our rescue pups that are infected.   In the cases of severe infection and if the pup is highly symptomatic, we sometimes use the fast-kill approach instead.   Again, we recommend for you to consult with your veterinarian after the adoption is complete and follow their recommendations.   \n\nIn order to be considered for one of our beautiful pups, please go to our website and complete and application: https://www.mustluvdogs.org/adoptable-pets.\nPlease note that we are a DUE DILIGENCE adoption organization. Part of our approval process requires, among other things:\n* Experienced pet home with verifiable vet references/history preferred, but we realize that everyone has to start somewhere, so all applications will be considered.\n*The majority, but not all, of our pets require a fenced yard or secure enclosure.  In the case of apartments, we require Landlord approval and designated dog area in complex.\n*Verifiable good veterinary history INCLUDING regular vaccination/visits and good Heartworm Prevention history is a MUST!\n*Adopter must be able to have time to spend with the pup and be able to provide the pup a safe environment to live.\n*ALL our dogs are expected to be primarily INSIDE dogs.  They MUST sleep inside the home.  We truly understand that some folks have working dogs (i.e. farmers, ranchers,etc); however, the majority of our dogs have had a rough life prior to coming to us & we want to make sure that they are showered with LUV & maybe even a bit spoiled for the rest of their lives. \n\nOther facts are also considered, including whether children or other pets are a good fit with the dog. \n\nMust Luv Dogs reserves the right to deny any applications that we don't think are a good fit with the pup. Our first & foremost concern is the dog's best interest. It is our MISSION to place them in a home that is a great fit for their needs for a lifetime of luv & being part of a family.\n*We will consider adoptions in any area; however, will do not ship or transport puppies under the age of 12 mos. We will ONLY transport an adult dog on a transport approved by MLD, at adopter's expense.\n* In order to be affordable and afford every family an opportunity to have a pup of their own, we keep our Adoption Fees low; however, please keep in mind that the fees we charge do not cover all costs for the pup.  Any additional donations are greatly appreciated!\n\nPlease note that all of our pets are in private foster homes. In order to reduce any stress or confusion for our pups, we require a completed, approved application BEFORE setting up a meet & greet for any of our pups.  Alternatively, you are always welcome to come meet any of our pups at one of our regular Adoption Events.   Our events are always posted on PetFinder OR on our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/mustLUVdogs.org.\n\nFinally, THANK YOU for considering Must Luv Dogs for your next pet. \n\n*Most dogs require a fenced area in yard. \n*Apartments okay IF nearby dog park or walking trails (with landlord appoval).\n*ALL dogs must be INSIDE dogs and treated a part of family. \n*We are a DUE DILIGENCE Adoption Rescue.  \n*Must have good Vet history & Heartworm prevention is a MUST!\n*ALL dogs are fully vetted, spay/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption.",

            "description": "**Due to the Covid 19 pandemic, our Adoption Team has decided to officially put all adoptions on pause. The health and safety of all involved is of utmost importance. Blind Dog Rescue Alliance prides ourselves in our very careful and thorough screening process of all applicants, and with all the current restrictions in our country, this is just not possible. We would not be able to conduct in-person home visits, a very important part of the process, nor would we be able to provide transport. As applications come in, they will be placed on hold until restrictions are lifted. Once restrictions have been lifted, we will reach out to the potential adopters to see if they are still interested before proceeding. If you have any questions please contact adoption@blinddogrescue.org. We appreciate your understanding during these difficult times.\n\nBlind Dog Rescue Alliance will transport within reasonable distance. Walker is being fostered in NJ.\n\nWhat we know about Walker:\n*is epileptic and on phenobarbital\n*young and loves to play\n*learning manners\n*housebroken\n*sweet\n*can see some in bright light, but has trouble in dim light\n\nWhat Walker's foster mom has to say about Walker:\nWalker is a solid, young dog. He is respectful of corrections, but loves to play non-stop if he can. He is a growly player. So expect him to talk back. He is learning from his foster home and four-legged family. Walker knows to go into his crate to be fed and he sleeps there too.\n\nWalker has limited vision as he has difficulty seeing in low light.  He has totally detached retinas possibly due to some sort of trauma. He does not appear to be in pain. The vet observed the eye movement (similar to vestibular) and the \u201coff\" gait he has. While exaggerated stepping is associated with the blindness, the limited correction of the paws when they fold over, and the wide spread of his body movements may be neurological.  Walker may be a little bit different but it does not slow him down.\n\nWalker will bark and scratch a door when he wants to go out. When crated, he will bark, when loose he goes straight to the door and scratch. He will notify you when it is time to be fed and will run right into his crate and patiently wait for his bowl. He, however, does not like when another dog comes around his food. \nWalker is anxious with new situations such as getting into the car, going to the vet etc. but settles when he has time to work out what is going on.  \n\n Walker is not comfortable around a lot of dogs and will probably do best in a home as an only dog with owners who are not away for long hours. He\u2019s a doll when cuddling by himself with his person or people. Total devotion. Takes treats ever so nicely (even from the vet techs he just met), needs some leash walking help. Still tries to chew on your shoes while your feet are still in them, loves to have you try and chase him, plays tug-of-war with rope toys, totally loves his Kong with cheese and any Nylabone.\nBlind Dog Rescue has voted against the use of electric fencing effective immediately.\n\n",

I am the definition of an \"underdog\" as I was being attacked by several large dogs that caused cosmetic damage to my mouth.  Thankfully, a Good Samaritan intervened and was able to save me before I could be seriously harmed.  Because of me not having a ideal start in life, I am very shy and weary of new people but will warm up with time.  I really need that special someone who is willing to work on breaking down my shy shell.  Is that special someone you?  I really need someone to just sit with me and win me over with treats (yum).  I want to trust someone so badly.\n\nIf you are not able to adopt me, please consider virtually adopting me or coming to spend time with me on the weekends!\n\nPlease visit havenacs.org for our visitation hours, information about the adoption process and to fill out an application!",

She is also an athletic dog that requires daily exercise, so a fenced in yard is required for Fiji to stretch her legs and play. She absolutely loves her dog toys and would prefer daily walks too!\n\nCurrently Fiji is living her best life now, but her young puppyhood was a rough start for her.  Not only was she severely malnourished, but she did not have good experiences with other dogs.  Due to this early trauma, Fiji just prefers to be an only dog.  Other dogs just make her nervous, so she wants a home that respects that and loves her just for the way she is. \n\nFiji does do well with children, but due to her muscular size she would do best with older children.\n\n If you are interested in Fiji, or have more questions about her, please contact her foster mom Tomoko at tdeguchi@yahoo.com, or you can follow Fiji on her foster mom\u2019s Instagram, tdeguchi1201.\n\n**Invisible fence is not a suitable option**\n\nIf you would like to meet Fiji then please fill out an application https://www.mynextpet.com/dog-application\n\n",

I really hope there is someone out there who can spend enough time with me to help me break out of my shell.  I am so sweet and hope that person is out there and coming to see me soon.  Are you that person?\n\nIf you are not able to adopt me, please consider virtually adopting me or coming to spend time with me on the weekends!\n\nPlease visit havenacs.org for our visitation hours, information about the adoption process and to fill out an application!",

Buddy is a great little guy for the right adult-only home. He is friendly and happy, but also a little bossy. Once in a home Buddy can get territorial and therefore he will need an experienced owner who understands when he wants to be left alone. He doesn't growl but does some body posturing that will let you know he is uncomfortable. Buddy loves to cuddle and be near you if it's on his terms. He is house trained and is in a foster home with other small dogs.  However, he does not get along with all dogs so it's best if the other dog in the home is submissive, or he is the only dog. Buddy LOVES toys, enjoys short walks and exploring the outside. He will be a wonderful companion for the right owner.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Buddy please first fill out the online adoption application at www.greatpets.org. If you have questions you can email us at info@greatpets.org. Buddy's $250 adoption fee includes his vet exam. vaccinations, neuter surgery, microchip and flea treatment.\n\n*Disclaimer: Buddy is territorial and may bite if he feels cornered or dominated. He has been adopted and returned for behavior. That is why we listed him as special needs. He will require a home committed to ongoing training & management. We are only accepting applications from families with no children under age of 18. *",

This boy tolerates just about any shenanigans you try to make him wear or do, once he\u2019s established trust with his humans. \n\nGator is great in calm households, but does not handle excessive excitement well. He is looking for a home without young children or excited dogs, as he does not know his own strength when high energy atmosphere gets him hyped up.",

Time passed, and we grew thirsty and drank a lot of the fluid to stay alive. \n\nAfter over 3 days we heard sweet voices and they were there to rescue us! They took us to a building called Grace Animal Hospital and more sweet voices welcomed us with open arms. \n\nWe were still terrified of everything, but after a long session of bathing...they got most of the oil off of us and gave us meds for our sickness. They gave us each a warm bed, clean water and good food. We are now resting and getting well. \n\nWe are realizing what love is all about. And we are not so afraid of what happens next anymore. We are now Streetdogs. Not street dogs. But real official Streetdog Foundation Streetdogs. From here on out we will always be safe and loved. We cannot wait to find out what our life will be like from now on!\n\nBehaviors not listed have yet to be tested.",

            "description": "Last Weigh-in: 78.4 lbs\n\nUpdate on our newbies from Founder, Melanie Pafford: Danny and sandy are still learning about human love. They had little to no human interaction for their 3 1/2 years. They are taking Burgies gently from us. Slowly but surely is how this is going! Coming to Grace Animal Hospital with hot Burgies is definitely the way to win friends here. Sitting and reading to them. Leaving a t-shirt you slept in with them. It will be a while before they can be leash walked. They are so hesitant about everything right now. But time and love will make all of the difference!\n\n------------------------------------------------------\nDanny Zuko\u2019s Story\nMy mate and I have been on the streets for 3 1/2 years. No one knows if we were ever around with people before... but we have seen people, and have tried to try to find food where they were. We have had to scavenge for what little was available to us for so so long, and just wanted to get somewhere dry and safe. We found an old Quonset hut that was very dark and seemed safe for the moment...until we got spooked, ran, and fell into a deep pit. The bottom of the pit was wet and rock hard when we hit, and we stayed so scared and very sore. We didn\u2019t know what happened, but we knew we were in a very bad place. \n\nWe tried and tried and tried to find a way out of this terrifying hole, but there was no way out for us. It was just too deep. We didn\u2019t know how we were going to survive. Our panic was so high and we were frantic with the fear of how we could live! After crawling around and pacing and searching for just one toehold...one ledge....we settled into the knowledge that we were trapped here. Time passed, and we grew thirsty and hungry. There was nothing down there but the wet chemical smell of machine sludge. We waited. All we could do was hope. We could not tell the passing of days or nights...but our exhausted bodies grew weaker and our hope grew dim. We had to have something inside us or we would die. So we started licking the wet vile tasting dampness from the floor. It made us sick...but it was all we had. \n\nWe knew that there was little hope, but we were trying so hard not to give in to our desperate situation. We had survived on our own for this long...surely this dark hole was not to be our end? But it seemed that was the case. Starved, dehydrated and so sick from what we ingested...we were barely able to lift our heads now. We curled around each other and sadly awaited our fate. In a hazy blur...we heard the sound of a door opening ...footsteps..and voices. A faint pin light was shining back and forth sometimes passing over our dungeon. Finally the voices and light came closer. So close that the light blinded us. We both closed our eyes and pressed together as tight as we could. The voices were frantic for a minute and we stayed still...and then the steps and light faded away and the door closed. When we heard no more sounds for a while we realized that our chances were gone. \n\nWe got up and tried to feel our way around and see if anything had changed...if we could get out.... but no. Same prison. So discouraged, we lay back down and stayed wrapped around each other. We hoped that we wouldn\u2019t have to suffer long. Life is hard for a pup without a home...and we were resigned and sad...but we had no choice. We lay down for what we thought was our last time. Later....through a haze of sickness..we heard the door open again and saw another sweeping of light. What would happen this time? We were too weak to do anything to protect ourselves. We just stayed wrapped together. Maybe the strange noise and light would just go away again and leave us in peace. We couldn\u2019t take any more pain. Suddenly a blast of white light filled a corner of our pit. The voices were back and this time I heard some of them speak softly and sweetly. They were telling us that everything would be okay and to trust us. One of the original voices was saying how he thought there was only one dog because of how close we were pressed to each other. Was this group of voices and shadows coming to help us or harm us? We just didn\u2019t know. A kind man crawled down a metal contraption to where we were and just spoke to us for a while. Another voice sang softly to us. They sounded so gentle. But we had only been chased by humans and kept to ourselves much of our lives. \n\nWe didn\u2019t know what to do. It didn\u2019t matter. We were too weak to do anything. The kind man gently put a soft towel around me and my partner and lifted us each up over his head and to his own partner. She took us in her arms and told us that we were safe and that we would no longer be hungry or thirsty or cold and hopeless anymore. These words sounded so sweet to us! We had never heard such a promise of love...but we were ready to find out what that meant! \n\nThey took us to a building called Grace Animal Hospital, and more sweet voices welcomed us with open arms. We were so so tired but so glad that we were out of that awful dark place. We were still terrified of everything, but after a long session of bathing...they got most of the oil off of us and gave us meds for our sickness. They gave us each a warm bed, clean water, and good food. We are now resting and getting well. Our starvation is still evident, and the nice people are giving many meals a day to help with that. The people who got us out of the pit come every day and talk with us and sing to us, and have started to stroke our fur. This is something we haven\u2019t had done before. So it is kind of scary\u2026 but also feels really good. Each of us has a really soft and safe friend whom they call Orange Puppy. We each agree that though he doesn\u2019t talk, he will listen to our worries and let us lay our heads on his shoulders. We trust him most of all right now. We are learning to trust the people with the sweet voices too. We are realizing what love is all about. And we are not so afraid of what happens next anymore. \n\nWe are now Streetdogs. Not street dogs. But real official Streetdog Foundation Streetdogs. From here on out we will always be safe and loved. We cannot wait to find out what our life will be like from now on!  \n\n*Behaviors not listed have yet to be tested.\n\n",

She\u2019s the sweetest girl I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of fostering. Very smart! Very gentle and lady-like. She is still shy meeting new people and being in new places but really opens up in no time. Loves playing with toys. She is leash trained. Elena would love a foster or forever home that is sensitive to pups that have lived on the streets and still getting used to the lux life. I have a cap on how many dogs I\u2019m allowed in my city otherwise I\u2019d never let this sweet girl go! \n\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\nElena\u2019s Story\nOn Tuesday, 1/19/2019, we introduced you to our #sdfJusticePups, Ruth Bader, Ginsburg, and O\u2019Connor. Shortly after we were so happy to finally locate their brother, Kennedy all with the help of some very dedicated volunteers, \n\nA few hours later, the Memphis Animal Services team was able to get mom (Elena)  and get her transferred over to us! Huge shout out to the Field Officer who was able to scoop her up and to Dani and Alexis for reaching out immediately to let us know we could come to get our mama!  #sdfElena is barely older than a puppy herself but she is so sweet and lets our volunteers carry her into Grace to get checked out.\n\nElena did test positive for Heartworms but Grace Animal Hospital is getting rid of those nasty buggers. She\u2019s up to date on her vaccinations and is preparing to meet the family of her dreams. Could it be you?\n\nMedical Update: Elena has been spayed and also has successfully completed her heartworm treatment. \n\n*Behaviors not listed have yet to be tested.",

He is a VERY shy guy but with TIME(maybe even months) and PATIENCE he warms up nicely. He is fully potty trained and crate trained. He does good  with other easy going dogs that will give him his space and with proper introductions and doesn't mind cats.  He can be leery of men but again with time and patience he warms up. This is a boy who you can't expect to be your best friend in a week. Barney will need you to give him space and time to warm up to his surroundings.Barney would do best in a home without young children. Barney is looking for his happily ever after. Barney's forever home does require a fenced in yard. \n\nBarney is vaccinated for rabies, distemper, and bordatella. He is neutered and is microchipped. Barney's adoption fee is $350 plus WI state tax!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Barney, please fill out an application at luckypawsmidwest.org. Once your application is approved, we can set up a time for you to meet him!\n\nLucky Paws Midwest is licensed and inspected by the State of Wisconsin: 402655-DS",

She loves to play and has lots of energy and would love an active house that can take her on walks or runs or a home with another dog to play with her.  She is crate trained.  She is a little excitable when first meeting you so may not be a good fit for little little kids because she may jump up and lick them, but may knock them down.  She is not a cat gal so no kitties.  She is as sweet as can be and just wants to give kisses. She was found scared to death on the streets and took time to trust again, but now she loves people.  You can apply for her at www.route66petrescue.org We show at Petsmart at 41st and Yale every Saturday from 11-3.",

            "description": "Mosby here, reporting for duty!\n\nMosby is a four-year-old shepherd/aussie/cattle dog mix and weighs around 50 pounds. He's a super smart, very trainable pooch. He already knows a ton of commands, including sit, stay, down, bring it, drop it, leave it, let\u2019s go, come, look, quiet, off, stay back, out, and even can ring a bell to let you know when he needs to go outside.\n\nSome of Mosby's favorite things in the world are: chew toys (especially with squeakers and stuffing to tear out), fetch, soccer (especially if the ball is one he can pick up with his teeth), walks/runs, treats, sleeping on the couch, sitting on the porch, dens (his crate, under the bed), hoarding toys, chasing/be chased by my foster (dog) brother, playful dogs, jumping up to hug you (but only briefly), sleeping on the bed, stretching out on the top of the couch like a cat, looking out the windows, laying upside down, and chasing the red laser dot.\n\nBecause he's so darned smart, we think Mosby would do great in a home where he can be a working dog, or in a home with a skilled owner or someone committed to his ongoing training, which The Pet Connection is happy to provide. Do you have a farm or acreage? Need some help from a super savvy pooch? Mosby might be just the helper dog you need! Do you have a quiet, adult-only home and think you might want a smarty- pants dog to train? Mosby could be your boy! Call or text The Pet Connection at 913-671-7387 for more information or to set up a time to meet Mosby!\n\n*Check out the cute Mosby baby pics, too!\n\n**Mosby is neutered, up to date on vaccinations, microchipped, and ready to go home! He is in the Kansas City metro area and eligible for a no-cost adoption for an encouraged donation.\n\n#thepetconnection #adoptdontshop #savealife #adoptadog #mosbyneedsyou\n",

            "description": "If you are interested in adopting this dog, please download and complete an Adoption Questionnaire from our website and email Marika at marikac@k-9lifesavers.org\nYou can learn about the adoption process and find a Word, PDF and ONLINE version of the questionnaire by visiting: http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/howtoadopt/.\nDog's Name: Toby the Terrier\nEstimated Breed : Terrier Mix\nApproximate Age: 4 years\nApproximate Weight: approx. 45 lbs\nCurrently Living at: Boarding\nAdoption Fee: $300\nDOG'S DESCRIPTION\nToby is a bundle of fun! He is an outgoing fella and loves to play. Once he knows and trusts you, he loves you and wants to be with you as much as possible, he's a great snuggler. Toby is looking for an active family and wouldn't thrive in apartment or urban environment unless you are a very active runner/hiker. Toby loves to play. When we dropped him off with his foster he was so excited to be in the yard! He ran and ran with a big smile on his face. He may be 4yrs old but still has a lot of puppy in him, would be a great jogging companion. Toby is currently with our trainer and has done great on acquiring good doggie manners and obedience training. He also does really well getting along and playing with the 3 doggies in trainer's home. He would do well in a home with a canine buddy or gal who can match his style of play and is playful and energetic like him. Toby is good with children and friendly. Just like any terrier he is a little too interested in kitties so we would not recommend him for a home with one. Toby has been a good boy, acquiring some excellent training and is ready for his forever home. Our trainer will even help you transition Toby into his new home successfully!\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\nSponsor Me! Make a tax-deductible donation today by visiting us at http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/donate/ . Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support!\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\nPlease \"like\" our Facebook Page for the most current events and new dogs.\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!",

Roo is now a healthy 65 pound, 9 year old black lab mix. She has gained weight and all her fur has grown back into a shiny coat. She is fully housebroken and is pretty good on a leash (she pulled a bit at first, but responds well to correction). She is very sweet and gets along well with my lab.  There are no children in my house, but she has spent time with friends' and family's kids and is very gentle with them. She loves her walks, but also loves exploring the back yard.  She has great energy on her walks, but is mostly chill the rest of the time. She is a sweet angel and would love a loving home! Come and meet Roo at Kristin's in Ft Lauderdale\n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting please go to LRRoF.org NOW and fill out an application.\n\nThanks so much for your interest in our rescue!\nYour support, both through adoption and donation is always essential to us and our Labs. Donate today!\nWe're about matching the right dog with the right family. All applicants will be assigned an Adoption Counselor who will act as their liaison. In addition, a phone interview, home inspection and vet reference (if applicable) are required for eligibility to adopt from Labrador Retriever Rescue of Florida.",

She loves to run and play with other dogs.\n\nRowan is skeptical of strangers, especially when new people are entering her home, so she requires an adopter that will be patient with her and advocate for her needs (slow introductions to strangers in a controlled environment). She is slower to warm up to men than women, however, once Rowan knows you, she wants all the love and snuggles!\n\nRowan does well on leash but shouldnt be left unattended in fenced in areas because she has tried to dig in the past she does great when supervised. She would love a home with room for her to run and play. Rowans perfect home would be female-centric, fairly calm, and experienced working with dogs that have stranger danger. She is thriving in her foster home and is looking for a family of her own so she can continue to shine.\n\nAge: 2 years\nWeight: 50 pounds\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application on our website at http://www.lasthopek9.org/ \n\nPlease Note: All dogs are posted until they are officially adopted. This dog may have other interested adopters in line. If you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application on our website at www.lasthopek9.org\n\nQuestions?

Due to anxiety, she must be in a home with adults only, who are experienced dog owners, are willing to providing professional training, and have no other dogs. She is a loving and playful girl who wants to please, but it takes some work to get her to gain trust and confidence around new people. \n\nAnd please try not to judge her kennel appearance; she is so much better out in the open. Can you see her potential as we can? Tabitha already knows the commands sit, lay down, and wait. \n\nWe ensure all of the animals adopted through our shelter are vaccinated, microchipped, and spayed or neutered.\n\nIf you love animals but cannot adopt, sponsoring an animal in our care is a meaningful way to help support the good work we do. For as little as $20 per month, you can sponsor a shelter pet and help pay for the cost of their care while they stay at the shelter. Secure your sponsorship online at njshelter.org.",

It tooks weeks to catch her as she was so scared but perseverance of a few of our volunteers, she was rescued. Quite shy at first, emaciated and full of parasites. No one claimed her so now it is time to find her forever home. She is still a little shy of men but warms up within a few, best with kids 12 and up, good with other dogs as well. She loves to go for walks and car rides. She requires a secure 6ft fence to ensure she doesn't end up on the streets again.",

            "description": "Axel von Apolda is a very handsome 1-2 year old Shepherd mix.  Axel started his journey to Westside not knowing what life was really about. He previously lived in a rural area where we suspect he was not exposed to many people or different situations. Our professional trainer is working with this special boy who needs an equally special owner -- one who is experienced with dogs, as well as calm and matter-of-fact versus sentimental or overly-affectionate -- one who will continue Axel's transformation, together with some complementary training that Westside will provide in his new adults-only home. Axel has come so far.  He now starts his day calmly and happily when he leaves his kennel.  His leash manners, with just a little reminder, are great and he takes in all the smells of his new life as he walks down the street.  Axel enjoys playgroups and interacts with all the dogs.  He gravitates to the calmer dogs who match his personality and even enjoys playing with them.  Those over-the-top ones, he avoids.  At our rescue facility Axel has become an affectionate boy with the staff.  He needs a little time to become comfortable with new people, so he needs someone willing to be patient with his progress.  Axel will be so grateful for a confident owner whom he can trust to expose him to new experiences in life. \nweighs approx 50-55#\n\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website!

Has been neutered vaccinated, and micro-chipped. Heartworm was positive but has been treated and now he has gone through the treatments, now heartworm test negative. Looks to be most American Pit Bull Terrier/ maybe some boxer. Plays nicely with other dogs just wants to play and be loved. Very well mannered in public, very sweet and mild mannered. \n\nHe has been fostered in a home which has Service Dog and has started to alert for diabetes. Many hours of training in public. Sherman has the potential to be a Diabetic Alert Dog and with his laid back easy going personality he might even be good as a child's Service Dog",

I would do best in an adult only home with someone who will be patient with me while I learn to trust again, as I have been through a lot lately.  It would be best if I am an only child.  I am very active and would love to have plenty of time to exercise and play, especially outside.  Can you find it in your heart to welcome me into your home?\n\nBandit is current on all shots, neutered and has tested negative for heartworm. He will be professionally groomed before adoption and will go home with a new leash and collar.\n\nTo apply:\n1.  You must reside within our adoptable states: NY, NJ, CT, RI, MA, VT, NH, PA, DE, MD, VA \n2.

            "description": "Maggie, or Moo Moo as affectionately called in her foster home, is quite the love bug and easily motivated by food and treats. Maggie shows and gives affection freely with people she loves and is comfortable with. You can easily find yourself with a Maggie-sized shadow who gives you kisses and hugs anytime you need them. She's an excellent hugger! Maggie can be slow to warm up to men but hasnt had issues with women and older children. \n\nMaggie is a 4yo Kelpie mix, who true to her breed loves to herd people and other animals. She displays typical herding breed behaviors like nipping at heels, herding other dogs and keeping them in line. She can and has lived successfully with other dogs, however, Maggie needs slow introductions, quick corrections, and a dog who can be submissive to her dominant personality. Her behavior with other dogs will need to be managed on a consistent basis so it experienced dog or herding breed owners are preferred. She will do best with an alpha handler who lets her know that they are the ones in charge, not her. \n\nMaggie has been attending weekly training classes to work on her leash behaviors and reactivity. Inside the home, Maggie loves sleeping and naps, enjoys a daily walk or active playtime throwing the toys, is crate trained, and potty trained. She loves riding in the car and can be the perfect companion if you want to be a marathon runner one day and a couch potato the next day \n\nIf Maggie might be the right fit for you, please submit an adoption application now! Please apply here: http://www.2babrescue.org/online-application\n\n*HOME OWNERSHIP REQUIRED!*\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Meet our precious little Lulu girl! Lulu was born in May 2018 and comes into rescue from Texas. This poor girl has already endured so much suffering and neglect in her young life. Lulu has something wrong with her heart and had a very bad case of demodex (non-contagious) mange causing hair loss and her skin to be very raw and infected. Lulu's skin is all fixed up now and we are managing the several congenital heart defects that we discovered she has. She is taking medications to help her heart and had a surgery to prolong her life. Despite our best efforts this sweet girl still has a guarded prognosis. She needs someone very special who can fill the rest of her time here with boundless amounts of love and happiness. Lulu is an absolutely adorable little angel. All it takes is one look into those beautiful eyes and you can see the love and sweetness that she is made of. Her special someone will need to be on board with taking her for frequent check ups to make sure that she continues to thrive for as long as possible but this shouldn't be a big deal because this miracle girl is totally worth it! She is strong willed with a heart of gold and is great with people of all ages (no young children as she's strong and energetic), other dogs and even cats! She is the total package and we can't wait to see her spoiled in her forever home! If you would like to be the lucky one that gets to give Lulu the happy ever after that she is so very deserving of, please fill out an adoption application for her here!

She has a drive to do a good job. Harper listens attentively, and works to follow commands the best she knows how. We really think that she would do well under any sort of training her new family would care to put her through.\n\n Harper is the kind of girl that would excel as a working dog with a job. Harper's ideal family would involve no kids, but instead a couple or a single person looking for companionship and looking to have a lifelong friend that they could devote their attention and patience towards.Harper is does well in her crate and great on a leash. She likes to have a job to do, and takes her job of patrolling the grounds seriously. She has taken it upon herself to be the guardian of our staff, and she loves her people very much. \n\nHarper isn't much for toys, but instead prefers to be on guard and working. She loves chicken! She is great at catching treats and rarely misses. She is very careful with her food not to alarm the person offering it to her. She is quite gentle with people that she knows are the alpha. Harper is currently 75 pounds. Harper is very intelligent and quite serious.Harper may require multiple meet and greets to get an accurate gauge of her personality.\n\n---\n\nPeach County Animal Rescue is a rescue located in Fort Valley, GA. Our adoption fees range from $250-350+. All of our dogs are fully vetted: up-to-date on annual shots, spayed/neutered and microchipped with a lifetime registration.

She's a beautiful girl who is a bit on the shy side, gentle, and she has lived with other dogs. Oh, and she's a looker, too, with those bright blue eyes and merle coat. Cheyenne is a graduate of our Group Training Class, Basic Obedience.\nWe wouldn't recommend that Cheyenne live with children, she prefers a quiet adult household. She would do best as an only dog. We're not sure about cats.\nTo meet Cheyenne, please fill out an application for adoption:\nhttp://www.deafdogrescueofamerica.org/adoption-application.html\n\nPlease note that we are unable to respond to inquiries, emails or phone calls. Our adoption process starts with completion/submission of an application for adoption. All applications are reviewed as quickly as we can, and our adoption process is not first come, first served. We select our adoptive homes according to what our dogs/puppies require. If you are selected as an appropriate match, you will be contacted to set an appointment to visit the Ranch and meet Cheyenne.",

He is wonderful with kids, loves his dog friends, and gets along great with cats.  Orion is extremely intelligent, as are all Border Collies. He is strong-willed, but he is also obedient. If you like larger dogs, that have a lot of love to give, Orion is your dog. Please call Sindee at 914-299-3700.",

I am 2 years old.\u00a0 I am tall and lanky with a lot of energy.\u00a0 I am a graduate of the New Leash on Life program so I know basic commands.\u00a0\u00a0 I love to please my people but I'm still learning, so don\u2019t be frustrated\u00a0with me if you have to repeat things.\u00a0 I walk great on a leash if I am on your left side.\u00a0 Completely house trained and will have to have a fenced in yard because I sometimes lose my brain when my nose takes over.\u00a0 \u00a0 I went in my previous home and it was the greatest thing ever.\u00a0 I am crate trained, but prefer to sleep with my people.\u00a0 But the best part is I am such a good boy that I can be trusted out of a crate when no one is home.\u00a0 Give me a bone and I will be fine.\u00a0 I don\u2019t realize how big I am, and my tail always wags so fragile things might need to moved to 'higher ground'.   I love, love, love respectful, kind children.\u00a0 I will be gentle playing with them I promise.\n\u00a0   So you know---deep voiced men scare me,  A LOT.  \u00a0 I am kinda shy to begin with and deep voices really terrify me.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 When I get stressed I vomit and get diarrhea.\u00a0  The reason I am up for adoption is I was just terrified of the man in the house, which broke my heart and their hearts as well.\u00a0 I need to be the only  dog (and  NO cats!)\n\u00a0 Otherwise everyone says I am the bestest boy ever and will try very hard to make you happy.\n\nfoster- Lori M.                                                posted--MR",

            "description": "In 'A Midsummer Night's Dream', Shakespeare writes of Hermia: \"And though she be but little, she is fierce\". We could not think of a more apt quote to describe our quite small but mighty friend Raven! Raven may be short in stature but she has an infectious personality and spirit that endears her to everyone at our shelter. She has many quirks, such as she gets a little \"foamy\" around the mouth when playing with a favorite toy, but it's all of her quirks that make Raven into such a fascinating dog.\u00a0\n\nRaven came to us from our rescue partner that helps transport dogs from Miami to the Northeast and from day one we knew we had a special dog on our hands. It was not just Raven's looks, but also physically how she walked and moved. Raven has myotonia congenita which may make her movements slower than your typical dog but does not stop her from enjoying dog playdates and stretching out for scratches like a cat.\u00a0She is an incredibly special soul that lights up whenever she is around her friends (both human and stuffed toys) and is waiting for her very own family to come along and see just how incredible she really is!\n\n\n\nContact the Adoptions team at (914) 273-1674 or adoptions@adoptadog,org for more information!\n\nThe first step to adopting one of our dogs is to fill out our online adoptions questionnaire located here: https://forms.gle/5heEH8S6c7zXBneD7\n",

Lucky for her, one of the members of our rescue noticed the dog bowl on the side of the road so she pulled over and out came Shelby to greet her.  She came out tail wagging with lots of kisses so happy to see someone.  She had a couple cuts on her head but she is all fixed up now and ready for her forever home.   \n\nShelby loves loves loves people.  She just wants to give everyone she meets a big kiss.  She is so happy to meet anyone and greets you with a full body wag.  Shelby does fine passing dogs and does great playing with them through a fence but she is not good with dogs once they are in her space so she is going to have to be an only dog in her home.  She is really great and friendly with people so she'd be good with older kids however since we haven't had her around small children we aren't sure how she'd be. \n\nShelby would like a home where she has a fenced yard to run and play in.  She'd love a home where she got to go on walks and get lots of love, toys, and snuggle time.  \n\nShelby is currently in boarding so we are not sure if she is house trained however she does keep her kennel clean.  \n\nShelby is spayed, microchipped, and current on her vaccines.  Her adoption fee is $175.  \n\nIf you would like to adopt Shelby and make her a part of your family, please contact ForeverYoursOKC@gmail.com.",

She does take a leisurely walk every morning and likes to lay on the couch or out on the front porch and watch the world go by. She seldom barks, sleeps a lot, and has a little waddle when she walks. She's very low maintenance, and very loving towards her human. She doesn't like thunder, is very particular about other dogs, and cannot be around cats.\n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this pet, please fill out an application at https://www.hopeanimalshelter.net/petfinder.

Because Ramsey does not trust men, so he needs a female owner. Other then that he is the greatest dog! Some backstory to Ramset as to why he is the way he is......Ramesy was seized as part of a cruelty case, he was then taken to the shelter where one of our volunteers met him and couldnt let him be euthinized and decided to foster him till he found a good home.. We have know idea what happened between him and his previous owner, but we can tell you it was a man and it was not pleasant. On the bright side he has been super spoiled for a year with his foster mom and her 3 other dogs of all sizes! His foster mommy took him through Heartworm treatment and he has the all clear now!Ramesy is rambuncious at times so he will need a fenced in yard to run off his energy freely! He is potty trained, crate trained, gets along with all dogs, is neutered and UTD on all vaccines. At 40 lbs Ramsey is on the smaller side and estimated to be around 4 yrs old.Ramsey is currently being fostered in South Haven, MS and will need an experienced owner.All our dogs deserve a loving home but sometimes it takes a little longer to find them...... If you have any questions please message us on Facebook at Charlie's Crusaders Pet Rescue or to submit an adoption application please go to charliescrusaders.org",

He loves to go for walks and has great scenting power as they were originally bred for hunting. On a leash he does well but would love to go chase lizards. He is a great outdoor and indoor companion. He loves to please and spend time but gets overstimulated and excited, he can be a little mouthy at first (playfully), but he listens well to verbal reprimands. He would be a great family dog and good companion for older, respectful kids, or a canine family member for a couple or single person.\nHe loves to go for walks and will help keep you fit! He is strong but generally walks good on a leash (he has a keen eye for Lizards and like many dogs will want to go chase). As strong as he is, he is also very tender-hearted.\nHis adoption fee is $50 and comes with support and consultation if needed from a professional trainer.\n\nContact admin@saferlifeline.org for a meet and greet or fill in an application at www.lovar.org",

            "description": "Levi is about 11 years young, is grey and white in color, and is a sweet older gentleman. He is a typical IG - a \u201cVelcro\u201d dog that loves nothing more than to be on his humans lap. He can get a little possessive of \u201chis\u201d lap, however, his foster family has been working with Levi and he is getting better with sharing his people.\n\nLevi is very good about pottying outside but is also pad trained.  He does well in a crate when his foster family isn\u2019t home, and sometimes enjoys laying in there when the door is open when they are home.  If you are looking for a dog that will snuggle on your lap and be your companion, you have found your match!\n\nLevi also came into rescue with his \u201cbrother\u201d Bailey, who is about 12 years young. He\u2019s a complete gentleman who enjoys the company of humans and other dogs alike.\n\nLike Levi, Bailey has zero potty issues - pottying outside isn\u2019t a problem for him and he is also pad trained if kept in a dog-safe room or crated for a few hours, as he also likes his crate and having some quiet time on occasion. Bailey isn\u2019t a lap dog per se, but he loves being scratched and pet and sharing your company.\n\nBailey has some facial paralysis due to an unknown cause from his younger years but experiences no other related symptoms.  Because of this his right eye waters a bit and his right ear sticks straight up which gives him cutest character!\n\nLevi and Bailey are both neutetered, are up to date on all of their vaccines and vetting needs, are both on a kidney diet wet food, and both take inexpensive medications daily.\n\nWe would love to see them adopted together as they are best buds and have been through a lot together. If you\u2019re interested in adopting Levi and Bailey please visit our website at www.IgRescueOhio.org and submit an adoption application so we can start the process for you.",

Blake is a male Pit Bull Terrier mix estimated to be 3 years old as of December 20202. Sadly, this poor boy had been living outside of a flea market for months trying to survive and fend for himself. He was hit by a car and a citizen reached out for help. Of course we said yes to this beautiful boy and off he went to our veterinary partner where he received all the medical care he required. Blake is a good boy who is friendly with people of all ages and other dogs. He will be neutered and up to date on vaccines prior to placement in his forever home. Blake deserves to finally know the warmth of his very own forever bed and unconditional love from his forever humans. If you would like to be the very lucky one that gets to give him the Happy ever after that he's been waiting for, please fill out an adoption application for Blake (TX) here: http://www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org",

He's a large male, and he's 7 years old, having been given up by his family when they moved and couldn't take him. He is in good condition other than thinner hair on his rump, possibly a sign of poor diet or fleas during the warm months.  Unfortunately, Sammy has not been able to socialize well with other dogs so he would have to be your one and only.  We also recommend Sammy for a Dobie-savvy adult home with no access to children.  Though he can be loving, he can also be a resource guarder and have territorial issues.  The proper environment will be necessary for him to safely thrive.",

He grunts like a bulldog and sometimes snores, but not always  ;)  The name is suitable, but a loving home can change his name to whatever they prefer.\n\n*TB sopposedly is offspring of registered purebred champion APBTs (impressive).    We were not concerned with showing nor breeding--  we wanted to save him so he'd be neutered and unable to create more unwanted dogs for those who adopt as a puppy and dump as an adult.    HE IS NEUTERED, without ability to overproduce.\n\nWe prefer he's in a home with zero aggressive animals, but he's been with packs of dogs, peacocks, and other animals.\n\nLoves to Walk on leash and explore his surroundings.  Doesn't mind baths, and loves car rides.     \n\nThank you for noticing how adorable he is!\n\nEmail goes straight to cell phone:\nUnleashMyHeart@hotmail.com to schedule a meet 'n greet.\n\nHUGs to you!!!!\nfrom TomBoy",

Winnie came in as a stray, dragging a leash, in terrible shape, with an awful upper respiratory infection. She was lethargic, not eating, had diarrhea, was vomiting, and had nasal discharge. Her body temperature was 105 degrees, when a normal dog temp is about 101 to 102. She crashed quickly and they brought her to the Emergency clinic, however the shelter is no place for a dog in such critical condition. Lucky for Winnie, we had a foster step up to see her through her recovery. Winnie had a terrible case of pneumonia and her lungs sounded very wet, but after many weeks of breathing treatments and antibiotics, her lungs finally cleared.\nABOUT WINNIE\nWinnie was a trooper through her medical treatments and has proved to be a wonderful lady. She has also done well with and enjoys the company of the other dogs in her foster home. Winnie is a happy go lucky gal that enjoys exploring outside and going for car rides. She gets very excited about going to rides and is a super strong gal. Her foster family is working with her on not pulling on the lead. At her foster home, you will likely find her chewing her Benebones or simply following her people around the house. She is a fairly active dog who will do best with regular exercise, or maybe even a doggie sibling to zoom around the yard with. She is crate-trained, housebroken, fully vetted, and ready for a forever family!\nWinnie's DNA test results are back and she is 75% American Staffordshire Terrier, 12.5% American Bulldog, and 12.5% Chow Chow\nPhoto Album of Winnie: https://www.facebook.com/pg/FriendsToTheForlornPitbullRescue/photos/?tab=album&album_id=2444899182234900\nOur adoption fee is $300. All dogs are current on vaccinations, spayed or neutered, micro-chipped, on heartworm prevention, and are fed top of the line grain-free food.www.savingpitbulls.org",

            "description": "Shooter is in search of a new home through no fault of his own.  His owner died and the man's wife did not want to keep him.  He was born in November 2018, and was raised as an inside dog.  He was then given to his most recent owner who kept him as an outside dog.  When that person died, his relatives were unwilling to take Shooter back.  Shooter is food aggressive, with humans and other animals, and needs someone willing to work with him. Shooter rides well in a car.  He is  very smart and quick to learn.   He is a talker and makes all kind of noises to communicate with you, which is unusual for a Great Pyr.  Shooter would do best with someone familiar with the breed. We recommend obedience training for all newly adopted pyrs, to help you create a special bond with you and your new friend, and so you have a well behaved canine. Great Pyrenees are willing to learn, but are not as eager to comply with commands as much as other breeds. They are bred to be independent thinkers. Applicants must be over 25, own their own home and all children in household must be over 10 years old. Your resident pets must be up to date on vaccines, sterilized, you must have a good history of vet care for them, and you must have used heartworm preventative year round for your dogs. \n\n\nShooter will be placed as an inside pet with outside privileges. You MUST have a securely fenced yard accessible from your home. Invisible fencing does not work with this breed and they will take the shock for the freedom.  Great Pyrenees are bred to roam and will create their own territory if not secured, which can led to them being lost, hit by vehicles or shot by people who see them as a threat. The breed is not a good off leash dog, and cannot be trusted to not run away.  A Great Pyrenees off leash is a \" DisAPyr.\" \n\nIf you are interested in adopting or fostering, please complete the appropriate application on our website, www.igpr.org under the Adopt tab. \n\nAll of our dogs marked as needing foster homes are also available for adoption.  If a dog is listed on this site, it is available.  No need to contact us to see if it is,  We do require you  complete the adoption application prior to meeting a dog.\n\nWe also offer a foster to adopt program. You foster the dog, and have first right of refusal on them if an approved application is submitted for them. \n\nIn fostering a dog, the dog comes to you fully vetted. and groomed. You provide good quality food, grooming, and we provide the heartworm preventative and medical care, if needed* .(*Based on approval from IGPR.)\n\nAdoption fee is $350",

Boomer spends his mornings playing with the dogs and chasing lizards when possible, followed by an afternoon of napping. Boomer is a little shy on the leash but once he puts a paw in the sand all of his fears fade away. Boomer is a beach dog, he is not swimmer but loves to watch the waves and roll in the sand. He loves people, kids, and other dogs. Boomer is dreaming of his forever beach buddy to lounge in the sun with and cuddle up with at night. If you are interested in fostering or adopting Boomer please contact us!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe great thing about adopting a Puerto rican sato is that each one is unique. They come in all shapes, sizes, colors and personalities. However, satos are generally grateful, loving, smart dogs who can adjust well to different situations. We love satos and know you will too!\n\nAdoption fee is waived if the pet must be transported to their new home in the United States and the adopter pays the transport fees.\n\nIf you are interested in this animal please fill our the application form you can find here:https://amigosdelosanimalespr.org/how-you-can-help/adopt/\n\nIf you have questions you can contact Ela at 859-536-4144; ela@amigosdelosanimalespr.org.",

When his favorite walkers come to shelter he immediately starts dancing and jumping as they come with the leash, Colorado loves to run circles around the yard and run up for quick pet and scratch behind the ears, Colorado is an amazing spirit that deserves to have a forever home with a person to call his own. While Colorado is amazing and playful he will require an EXPERIENCED rescuer as he was previously used as a bait dog. We are happy to report that Colorado is making great strides in his behavior. He has improved his walking and socializing skills. He likes to spend time with othe dogs for short periods of time. Make an appt to come meet this beautiful boy!\n\n",

Nancy loves love and attention and deserves the world. she has the cutest zoomies ever! please give this girl a chance at the life she truly deserves! Nancy is fully vetted, microchipped, up to date on shots, has been dewormed, is heartworm negative and is on flea and heartworm preventative. she's a very gentle girl, but a meet and greet with any current dogs would be best for her before bringing her home! if interested in Nancy, you can email me at ayurcisin27@yahoo.com",

If you don't know the age, breed, weight, what vet care we provide our dogs, the adoption fee, or how to apply, you have not read the write-up. \n\nKellis\n\nBreed: Chihuahua\nGender: Male, neutered\nDOB:   3-19-2015\nWeight:    6 pounds\nMicrochipped  \nAdoption Fee:  $250\n\nKellis had an odd start. We don't know if his owner had him his entire life or got him as an adult. What we do know is that his owner had not worked on poor behavior and had not properly socialized Kellis. He was a barking, snapping, snarling, growling, howling mess when he entered our program!\n\nToday, Kellis enjoys people, enjoys lap time, loves going for walks and has liked just about every new person he has met. He still has people that scare him and he will bark at them. Simply correct him, choose if you want to work on the issue then- or just move on. He's a fun and loving dog and, in the right hands, should continue to be a great little companion!\n\nGood w/ Other Dogs- Yes\nGood w/ Cats- Unknown, but may be fine\nEnergy Level- Moderate\nChildren- No. While he did well with kids in his last home, we will not chance it\nGrooming Needs- Low\nWalks on Leash- Yes\nSpecial Needs- No\nKnows basic commands- No \nExperienced Home- Required\nGood First Time Dog- No\nRides well in car-  Yes\nCrate Trained-  Yes\nLow Allergen- No\nGood apartment dog- No    \n\nAdoptive homes within the  Raleigh, NC area only.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this pet, please copy and paste this link to our adoption survey into your browser:  https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdehkuFyLcCDhVB4SWB0h3aNCHUCHA8lZemxr3dUYl2wM8zyg/viewform?c=0&w=1! \n\nThis dog attends Cary Meet and Greet events!  Not all pets in our program attend every event.  We do not arrange meetings with our pets, outside Meet and Greet events, without an approved application.\n\nAll HEART dogs have been spayed/neutered, vaccinated for rabies, distemper, parvo, adenovirus, and hepatitis. Some have been vaccinated for Bordatella. All are tested for heartworms and, if they test positive, have either been treated or provided alternative slow-kill treatment. Dogs are provided monthly heartworm and flea prevention. Dogs are also provided additional medical care, as needed. This care may include amputations, wound repair, treatment for skin disorders, dental care, treatment for infection and other medical needs.",

            "description": "ADOPTION FEE:$100\n\nOwen is a boxer/pit bull mix who was found as a stray, and is about 10 yrs old and 75 lbs.  He must have lived in a home before, as he has been wonderfully behaved in his foster home, without any accidents, chewing or getting into things. When left alone, he will hang out on the couch and wait.  He is friendly with people, loves going for walks, playing with balls, taking the stuffing out of stuffed squeaky toys, curling up with his fleece blanket, laying in the sun, chasing squirrels and bees, and running around the yard.  \n\nHe walks well on a leash, though can pull strongly if he sees a something to chase.  After his walk, he doesn\u2019t mind spending the morning sleeping or relaxing and looking out the window. He has a good amount of energy and gets quite active and playful in the later in the day.  He does well with 2 walks a day and yard time to play and run.   He can get boisterous when he plays so a home without small children would be best.\n\nOwen would do best as an only dog, but possibly with a friendly small dog or cat.  He doesn\u2019t live with other pets in his foster home, and seems to like meeting the small dogs, but is not as receptive to larger ones.  There's not much interest in playing or sharing his toys with other dogs once he\u2019s met them. He passed a cat test at the shelter though shows interest in chasing strays. \n\nOwen's back knees are stiff from arthritis, with limited range of motion, and he is careful of them when laying down, and will sit or lay with his legs sticking out. It doesn\u2019t stop him from jumping and running around or climbing a few stairs, and he does well with a soft place to lay where he can stretch out and rest when needed.  He likes to sit in the car, but doesn\u2019t do so well on rides.  Owen doesn't tolerate being crated, and will need a fenced yard.\n\nFollow this link to our online application\nhttps://rawhiderescue.org/?page_id=13\n\n\nTHIS IS THE LINK TO THE APPLICATION WORD DOCUMENT OR PDF THAT CAN BE EMAILED TO RAWHIDERESCUE@HOTMAIL.COM:\n http://members.petfinder.com/~NJ235/Forms/RawhideDogApplication.doc\n http://rawhiderescue.com/RawhideDogApplication.pdf\n\nOUR HOME PAGE:\n http://www.rawhiderescue.org",

My name is Jasper, I am 5 years old and I love people so much. I wouldn't make a good guard dog because I make friends with everyone! I am house trained, crate trained, and on heartworm prevention. Foster mom took me to the doggie doctor to get neutered and all my shots and my microchip. Foster mom says I am ready to meet my forever family now! I love to snuggle. I love to go on walks and runs. I need a home where I am the only animal. You see, before I came to the rescue I had to fight for food and for everything just to stay alive. Because of that I don't do great sharing a house with other animals. I am ok to go on walks and hikes though, I just need to be the only animal in my family's home. I know how to walk well on a leash and I know how to sit, lay down, and catch treats if you throw them. If you would like to meet me please let the rescue ladies know!\nIf you are interested in adopting any of our available pets, please click the \"dog adoption application\" or \"cat adoption application\", and we will contact you to let you know if you are approved. We look forward to hearing from you and hope to be able to find your new furever family member.\n\n1/10/21 10:23 AM",

            "description": "Zhoey came to us from an owner who had no idea how to help her. When she went to her foster home, the skin on her belly was like leather. Her issue was allergies. They caused itching so bad that she was missing fur. She had never been socialized with other dogs, but she quickly learned that her four-legged foster brothers could protect her and teach her. They taught her that the vacuum wasn\u2019t so scary and that the dogs she encountered on her walks weren\u2019t all so bad.\n\nZhoey has come a long way too with her allergies. She is on a special diet and taking medication, but now her fur is the softest and shiniest, with no more bald patches. She is a beauty. She gets regular baths and never gives her foster a hard time. She loves to prance around after every bath letting her foster brothers know she smells oh so much better than they do. Maybe they can be next.\n\nDid we say that Zhoey\u2019s come a long way? Oh, yes. Her buddies taught her that it was okay to be in the big world and that it is fun to play, and that is what she loves to do. Zhoey is a super high-energy dog that loves to run and play with her dog friends. She can do laps through the gardens, around the fruit trees, as fast as the fastest. She can wear the fastest out, but when they\u2019re done, she will happily move on to her next friend. She also loves and very much respects her 11-year-old \u201cmama dog\u201d and mentor. She loves to follow her around, probably learning new things with every step of the way.\n\nLike some dogs who have gone through their own issues, Zhoey is very empathic to those around her. She looks into your eyes with those beautiful sweet brown eyes like she knows that you are in pain and would gladly lay her head down on your knee just to be able to could help you like she was helped before. Zhoey is a special girl who can make you laugh when you need it, give you a wet sloppy kiss when you need it, and just be by your side when you need it.\n\nIf Zhoey could make her dream list for her future home, it would, of course, include a family that will take care of her forever, but also she would love some four-legged canine friends to play with. After all, not many humans can keep up with her puppy energy. She would love a big yard to run and play with her friends in too, and if there are lizards and squirrels, oh, that would be so much fun. She\u2019ll make sure she keeps your garden safe from them.\nPlease visit http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/ to learn more about our dogs. Click on available dogs to see further descriptions. If you are interested in me, please contact us at information@coastalgsrsd.org or call (858) 779-9149. Don't forget to fill out our online application:  http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/webform/1774/adoption-application.\n\nThe minimum adoption donation ranges from $300 to $400. This amount only partially covers the cost of veterinary care, boarding fees, and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs and is 100% tax deductible.\n\nPrior to placement, all dogs will be spayed or neutered, receive current vaccinations, and are usually microchipped. If not, arrangements will be made on an individual basis. Special consideration may be given to those willing to adopt older dogs or dogs with physical problems.\n\nOur adoption process begins with completing an application on-line. A phone screening will soon follow, and lastly a home visit will be conducted by our volunteers.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.All of the animals posted on our site have been temperament tested. While not all are in the immediate area, once we have processed and approved your application, we will move the dog to our adoptive area for you to meet, greet and hopefully adopt. Sometimes we will have more than one application on a dog. That does not mean it automatically goes to another family but you should be aware of the fact that until you are approved and set up for the meet/greet.. the dog could get adopted by another applicant.Heath is a young dog and ready to be an ideal best friend and family dog. He has a naturally sweet and happy temperament. He wants to hear you say 'Good boy' a lot, so he will listen to what you want and then try his best to do it. He is full of life and friendliness and is going to love playing in your backyard and going for walks. Even better, he would be delighted to accompany you for jogs or hikes, or camping. He is good with most other dogs, however, he is very strong and likes to play a little rough. We have made sure he is all ready to go by getting him all his shots and a thorough vetting. He is ready to begin life with you and to show you what a good dog he is. A SPECIAL NOTE TO YOU FROM HIS FOSTER: Heath is a young healthy, housetrained dog who loves people, loves kids but may be too strong for younger children. He is a bit too interested in cats so probably better not to have any in his new home. He is crate trained, takes treats gently, and is smart as a whip. All ready knows sit, and paw and is working on come. Heath is a high energy dog and will need someone that can exercise him multiple times a day to keep him happy. He's just an overall good dog. Heath loves to play so a fenced yard is needed so he can run off all that energy! No cats and most likely only dog because of his energy.\nHeath needs a very active family as he likes exercise!\nIf you are interested in Heath, please contact:\nrorrcanine@gmail.com\n*** Click here to sponsor this dog! ***",

I have an eye issue that requires medicated drops but they feel so good I'll sit and wait patiently while you clean my eyes and put them in. I'm housebroken and love people! I know sit and am learning this new word, wait! I mostly like other dogs, but sometimes they surprise me because of my bad eyes and I don't like it when they do that. Will you be my new bff and forever friend???We do not have a shelter facility and our pets are housed in foster homes, vet clinics and local boarding facilities.\n\nMany of our adoptable pets attend adoption events each Saturday at Mall of Georgia Petsmart in Buford, Georgia from 11:30-3:00 pm\n\nPlease check with us to find out if a particular pet will be available. Dogs going to adoption event are typically posted on our Facebook page the day prior.\n\nDetails about our adoption procedures can be seen at www.pupandcatco.com.",

She has no front teeth and her eyes might need surgery. She might have had dry eye her entire life that was never treated. He ear is mangled and she has been bred too many times to count. She truly had no hope if Nala's did not take her . We are not sure of her age but she is probably 10 or 11. If you have in your heart to give a sweet senior a peaceful place to live out her life, and finally show her what love is, please contact us.\n\nTo adopt or foster, please submit a fully completed application on our website at www.nalasrescue.org/adoption-application.\nWe are located in Palm City, FL and we adopt mostly in a 50 miles radius. We always do home visit, and personalized meet and greet, to insure that your new companion will be a great match for your family.\n\n\n",

She is a six-year-old lab mix and on the larger size at about 149 pounds.\n\nStar was adopted from a shelter as a puppy and returned six years later. The poor girl was itchy, had hair loss and horribly infected ears, and was urinating blood when she came to The Sanctuary by the Pet Connection. Her untreated chronic allergies were causing her major discomfort. She was in pain and so frightened that we couldn't touch her for eight weeks. ? Now that she's had proper medical care, good food, and a loving, supportive environment, Star is feeling sooooo much better! ??\n\nStar is a fantastic dog. Some might even call her . . . a Star! ?? She is housebroken and not at all destructive. She's good on leash and very obedient. Star is also a fan of good movies, particularly when viewed with her human on the couch, perhaps with a belly rub! ?? But Star does have another side -- she is a silly goofball, too! ?\n\nStar likes most other dogs but would prefer that they not mess with her food and toys. ?? (Gottta admit, we're with her on that one! ?) She's still a shy girl but does great with a slow introduction to new people. After what she's been through, who could blame her for wanting to carefully assess her new peeps? ?\n\nThe Pet Connection will happily provide her foster and forever homes with behavioral support for Star, including proper introductions to strangers entering the home. Her medical needs aren't complicated -- treatment for her ears and skin and daily medication. ?\n\nCan you help Star put her best paw forward? ? Call or text The Pet Connection at 913-671-7387 for more info on fostering or adopting this Star!\n\n*Star is staying with The Pet Connection in Beloit, KS, but transport is available for the right home!",

She takes 3 types of prescription drugs plus monthly flea and tick meds, and grain free food, to help keep her allergies and skin issues in check. Because she is so very reactive and skiddish, she is not a good candidate for adoption.  She lives in foster care with several other dogs but does continue to be overly reactive with everyone, 2 legged and 4.\n\nAll of Beauty's meds, vet care and special food are costly.  If you would like to help by sponsoring or just donating for Beauty's care, please donate via paypal to dalrescue@sbcglobal.net.  There is a donate button for paypal on the website, dalrescuesocal.com or you can go thru paypal.com.  Beauty is doing well in foster care and is finally beginning to understand that humans and other dogs can be her friends. We are very glad we are able to keep her comfortable and happy in foster care.  If you can help please do email us at dalrescue@sbcglobal.net.\n\nTo learn more about Dalmatian Rescue of Southern California, Inc., a 501c3 non-profit charity, and to see all of our available dogs, please visit our website at www.dalrescuesocal.com.

He is House trained but doesn't like car rides. Tim will need an experienced owner, as he is a big boy with lots of energy. He needs to be the only dog in the  home, because he  can be dog selective and he does not like cats. Children must be 12 years or older. By nature English Bull Dogs are a stubborn breed with a lot of energy. Tim has been waiting for his forever and deserves to find a loving family, will you be the one?

Liv is a tripod (3 legs) but gets around like a normal dog. \n\nLiv has recently lost some much needed pounds. It\u2019s hard to say \u201cno\u201d to that face. She loves all food. She will hold out on taking a treat if she knows there's something better coming. \n\nShe thinks she is a lap dog, but it doesn\u2019t always work out for her foster mom.  Liv is ok with it not working out for her foster mom; she circles up in her lap anyway.  \n\nBecause of her past, she would like to be the Queen bee in her home, with no worries of other dogs being mean to her. \n\nIf you have children they should be older (8 and up) and respectful of animals.  This girl would actually make a great homework buddy.  \n\nIf you would like to be considered for adoption, please complete the adoption questionnaire on our website www.heartsofgoldpitrescue.com.  \n\n*2-3 years old\n*House trained\n*Crate trained\n*Needs to be an ONLY dog\n\n\n\n",

Event locations do vary so please check the homepage to find out where we will be this week. Please do not ask us to reduce adoption fees since all fees help us to cover medical expenses for all of our animals, some of which can be very expensive.  Saving lives is not cheap so thank you for your understanding and helping us save as many as possible.\n\nPlease email lowcountryanimalrescue@ymail.com for an application.",

The resulting side effects called calcinosis cutis which he still has and will always have. There is no reversing the effects of this disease but we are doing all we can to make sure it does not progress any farther. ( He looks like he had a turtle shell on his back) Kamen is on a no grain diet with no grain treats. He does well with well behaved children (over 6) other dogs as long as they do not get in his face. He is a wonderful, sweet, totally house trained boy who needs to find the loving home he so richly deserves.\n\nIf you have ANY QUESTIONS or are truly interested in adopting any animal from PAW Animal Shelter Please, fillout an adoption application FIRST! WE are a high intake No Kill Shelter ran by a staff of 4 and do not always have time to answer every question asked by so many. If you are a good fit for the animal you are interested in -we will call to speak with you, If we feel you are not a good fit , we will contact you about other pets that may be a good fit for your home. Many people are losing the opportunity to adopt the animal they want because they fail to put in an application and the pet was adopted before we could answer your email. .If you have applied for an animal in our facility and have not received a response within 7 days, PLEASE call or contact us again. Though we do our best in trying to answer all emails in a timely manner, sometimes things get away from us, get lost or misplaced. It is never our intention to ignore a request about an adoptable animal in our facility..\n\nSandy Brown, Director, PAW Animal Shelter\n\n319-372-2274\n\n PAW Animal Shelter is a high intake No Kill Shelter ran by a staff of 4.

He was living with another male dog and the two did not get along; since Rocky was the newest member of the family, he was regretfully relinquished.\n\nWe have found Rocky to be an initially shy boy especially around women; he seems to prefer men. However, once he warms up he is affectionate and really loves a good butt rub! Rocky has no bad habits: he is not a barker, chewer, or digger. He enjoys going for walks and he is quiet in his crate.\n\nRocky prefers humans to other dogs. Like most male Dobermans he needs to be the only male dog in the house. Although Rocky did live with kids we think the best home for him would be with a single person or couple who have plenty of time to spend with their dog. Rocky is house-trained and crate-trained and he has a medium energy level. He was born in December of 2016.",

They are a bonded Chihuahua duo and must be adopted together.  Bosley is apx. 4 pounds and around 3 years old and Stewie is apx. 7 lbs and 6 years old.  Both are very sweet boys who are a bit shy and timid at first, but warm up to people quickly.  They have fantastic personalities (as you can see by Bos' favorite down dog pose) and are very playful.  Like their brother Jerry, they do well with their foster fursibs but do NOT prefer the company of cats!  They require a fenced yard and a home with older children (if any) who have experience with small dogs, due to their petite size.  Their current foster family has very responsible and gentle kids and they LOVE them!  They are pad trained and do well with potty as long as let out on a regular schedule.  They are also crate trained although they have free-roam of the kitchen while their fosters are gone and they haven't had any issues so far.  These boys are current on vaccinations, neutered, and microchipped.  Adoption fee is $550. If interested in this dynamic duo, please fill out an application from our website www.revolutionrescue.com and we will be in touch!",

Because of his size, weighing over 100 lbs, Gus would fit best in a home with older children 12 and up and a family with Dane experience. He is good with other dogs and a fence is recommended.\n\nHe loves to cuddle in bed or lounge on the sofa. Gus definitely needs someone that is home a lot, at least in the beginning so he gets used to their scent and being around as he gets acclimated. A quieter home would probably be ideal as he is going to be on high alert in a new surrounding. Once he realized all was well, he would curl back up on the couch. \n\nGus will need a family that gives him time to adjust to his new home. Someone that will let Gus come to them when he is ready and not try to force a bond immediately. Someone that is mindful of his eyes and what side he can see out of and remember that when they go to pet him - again, just in the beginning. \n\nHes loves to play tug of war and I will give you all his toys (if you want them) but most of the day he just eats and sleeps...even with me being home all day. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please review our adoption policies and apply online at [www.speakfortheunspoken.com/adopt](http://www.speakfortheunspoken.com/adopt).\n\nVisit [www.speakfortheunspoken.com](http://www.speakfortheunspoken.com/) will give you more information about our rescue.\n\n***PLEASE READ*** WE DO NOT RESPOND TO PETFINDER OR EMAIL INQUIRIES. Please fill out an application on our website if you are interested in adopting this dog. We will only set up a meeting with the dog once you have an approved adoption application. We actively manage our dogs on Petfinder, the dogs listed are available for adoption. We will remove the dog from view once they are pending adoption.",

            "description": "Pug Rescue of New England (PRoNE) is a non-profit 501(c)(3), all volunteer foster home based rescue organization. Available\nPuma, 6yr old chihuahua\n\nThis little 8.5lb guy looks just like a TEDDY BEAR in person! He has been dosed with a form of CHF (Congestive Heart Failure) which will monitoring and medication for progression. He's super affectionate with grown-ups, and tolerates children, but on his terms. He is learning how to play with the other dogs in his foster home. Puma is more comfortable with small dogs but is aggressive toward the pug, Frenchie, and lab in his foster home. For these reasons, we think he'd do best in an adult only home or with older dog savvy children (8 years or older) and only one or two dogs less than 10 pounds in size.\n\nPuma is the perfect pint-sized travel companion, or couch potato dog. Just don't forget to take him on a few walks each day\n\nQualifications your home must meet to be considered for adoption:\n\nAll children living in or frequently visiting your home must be 8 years of age or over with no likelihood of this changing\nFenced in yard or home without direct outdoor access (to limit risk of Puma running out the door to the yard/street when it is opened - this has happened in Puma's foster home - gates blocking access to front doors is adequate and must be installed at time of home visit)\nOnly 0-2 other dogs in the home, and all must be less than 10 pounds in size. Puma will resource guard food, humans, toys, and territory but he will also play with dogs smaller than he is.\nChihuahua savvy home accustomed to chi habits such as barking and bonding with one person exclusively\nMust be willing to continue housebreaking Puma as he has not fully caught on yet\nMust be afford periodic vet visits, medication and continued monitoring of Puma's heart condition.\nIf you are interested in adopting, your home situation MUST meet this criteria:\nA vet reference check, dog walker check (if applicable), landlord check (if applicable), a phone interview and home visit will be conducted prior to approval. If you think a pug is right for your family and you meet the criteria, please apply to adopt on our website at www.pugrescueofnewengland.org.\nBE SURE TO REFERENCE THE SPECIFIC PUG!\nOur mission is simple: we find homes for abandoned and surrendered pugs in New England. Our pugs will be UTD on shots and spayed or neutered prior to adoption. You must be a resident of New England (New York residents carefully considered).\nPRoNE is supported by adoption fees, donations and funds raised through auctions and events. Adoption fees range from $150-$500.\nAdoption FAQs: pugrescueofnewengland.org/adopt/adoption-faqsAdoption App: pugrescueofnewengland.org/adopt/adoption-application\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/PugRescueofNewEngland/\n11/12/20 2:37 PM",

Max is a mature, older gentleman who seems to know what he wants in life. None of that puppy, high energy nonsense. Max is an 8 years old dog who loves humans. He came to us, along with two of his siblings, when his owner unexpectedly passed away. \n\nWe don\u2019t know much about Max\u2019s life before becoming a Lucky Lab but he does have some scars on his face. Max gets along well with other dogs but he is a little dominant. This is not a major issue. He just wants to be the boss! Max loves human companionship. He loves to be close to people and feel human touch. Just stand next to him and he will immediately lean into you! This boy seems to have had a long life before he came to us, but we want to show him that there is still a long life ahead of him, full of snuggles and kisses, galore!\n\nMax is neutered, up to date on vaccinations, kept on monthly preventatives, and microchipped.  \n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please apply at www.luckylabrescue.com and indicate \u201cMax\u201d in the notes section.",

BUDDY is a neutered male, boxer/bulldog/terrier blend...and like all of our fostered kids current on vaccines, heartworm negative, crate trained, house trained, and walks well on leash.   We believe he is around 7 or 8yrs, and 60lbs   BUDDY has a unique personality; he will talk when he has to go \"out to potty\" or if he just wants outside to meander and nap in the sun.  He enjoys cuddling up in couch corner, OR on top his crate (if there are lots of blankets there),  OR in an easy chair after his walk OR playtime with his favorite toys.  He will bring you his favorite toy in hopes you will play with him for a few minutes THEN he is content to play alone.  At mealtime, he sits politely and drools while you prepare his meals.   BUDDY loves \"nose work\" the more opportunity for him to SNIFF (hunt) & FIND the more FUN for him when he explores scents in his yard and on his walks!!  Sometimes he shows his stubborn streak when walking IF he feels sniffing and peeing is more important than walking, lol  Buddy LOVES his food and treats....so training is easy with him ;-)  He is very SMART,  he knows Sit, Stay, Leave it, and Here .  His RECALL and OBEDIENCE grows stronger WHEN his trusts grows stronger  with his caretaker; consistent rules and high value (low calorie treats) are important to BUDDY....HE thrives on routine.   BUDDY's curiosity to explore and protect is strong; so, it is best not to leave him unsupervised and unleashed in a yard; he can/could jump a fence IF a dog or cat approaches.    He enjoys his human companions and will give you kisses (ear licks) after he feels you have earned his trust and respect as his loving caretaker.   Buddy would do best as an only dog.  Children 12yrs and older are recommended due to his strength & size.     If interested in BUDDY, send us an adoption application located on the ADOPTME page at Dream4pets.org    We have a 120 mile radius from MIAMI COUNTY for adopting most of our dogs.      If interested in BUDDY, please send us an adoption application found on the ADOPTME page at Dream4pets.org .  or Email Petsrrpassion@gmail.com    Our adoption radius is typically 120 miles from Miami COunty (Troy, Tipp City, Piqua area)\n\n",

He is unsure of new people and needs time to build trust and a bond; requiring a few meet and greets. Banner needs someone to help with socializing but also a low traffic home. Preferably no kids, older teens possibly, no other animals, and a fenced yard. Banner loves to be outside and playing with his toys or chewing on a bone. He at first pulls on the leash but get him going and he walks good, he is smart and knows all basic commands. When Banner gets to know you, he becomes a big marshmallow and will give you lots of love. Banner truly is an amazing dog, but just needs someone to give him the time and attention he needs.",

We have the best canine co-pilots and kitties in space, waiting for YOU to pick them up on your way to Area 51 :) \n\n\n\nHi my name is Rex. I\u2019m a big old sweet guy. Unfortunately I wasn\u2019t treated very well throughout my life but now I have a chance to sleep on a soft bed. I love to eat yummy food and occasionally like to play with my foster mom.\n\nRex just came in to the rescue in very poor condition. Thankfully he is HW neg and his intestinal parasites are cleared away now. He is the sweetest, most velcro old man you could ever hope to meet. \n\nContact: nopawleftbehind@gmail.com\nInfo about our adoptables: http://www.nopawleftbehind.org/adoptions\nAdoption Application: http://nopawleftbehind.wufoo.com/forms/no-paw-left-behind-canine-adoption-application/",

He might not be the biggest cuddle bug but he does give you kisses if you ask for them.  He is very obedient and will entertain himself if his family is busy. \n\nLoves kids of all ages but he could push over small children, so we recommend older children. He needs a yard to play in. \n\nCan we meet?  I love play dates!\n\nApplication, home visit and adoption fee required.",

She also has arthritis in her elbows and is on a joint supplement and pain medication. She needs a home where she can have a comfy bed and enjoy her senior years.  \n\nShe is also part of our foster forever program where we will provide all the medical care and you provide a loving home.",

Don't let that fool you though, she's a typical bulldog with a typical bulldog personality. If she doesn't want to do it, it isn't going to happen!\n\nOink has pretty severe separation anxiety and needs to be on anti anxiety meds. She would do best with a stay at home person.\n\nOink has bad knees in both back legs, but the specialists have cleared her for a long healthy life with no surgery! She walks a little funny but that doesn't stop her! Oink will need someone willing to maintain her trim figure to not put further stress on her joints, and may need a joint supplement long term. But otherwise she is set to go!\n\nThank you for your interest in adopting from HMF. All of our pets are spayed/neutered, current on vaccinations, microchipped and otherwise healthy, unless noted in the description. Our adoption area is within 50 miles of Franklin/Bargersville, IN.\n\nWe hold a monthly adoption event on the last Saturday of each month from 12:00 noon until 3:00 p.m. at the new Center Grove Pet Valu store.\n5885 N St Rd 135 Bargersville IN\n\nDirect questions to: general@hopemariesfund.org\n\n1/24/21 10:34 PM",

Wants to chase them, probably would catch and harm them. \n\nWhen our shelter refused to take him back, other than to euthanize him, we took him in as a foster dog. \n\nHe loves people, very sweet around people, and very submissive around other dogs. He does have a puppy like energy to him, so we think he is about a year and a half to 2 years old looking at his teeth.\n\nThings we love about Meelo- \n1. No one is happier than Meelo in the morning. \n2. Does his Happy Feet dance when its his time to get out. \n3. Tries to entice Ginger to play by walking sideways (or backwards) into her, and then looks sideways to see if she is gonna take the bait.",

            "description": "Beautiful blue female looking for a quiet home in the country.  Enjoys evenings by the fireplace, quiet walks in the woods and cuddling with her loved one.  If we were writing a singles ad for our sweet girl that is likely how it would start. There is so much we can tell you about this wonderful dog.  And we know the right home is out there just waiting for her to join them.\n\nDelilah loves long walks and as with any good pittie she just loves everyone she meets. Weighing in at about 70 pounds she could easily be considered a large dog. And she can be pretty strong when walking her on leash with a regular collar. But with a SENSE-sation harness or Gentle Leader Easy Walk Harness she walks very well.\n\n\nTo meet Delilah it is hard to believe that she was originally found tied to a fence in NYC. She was then taken in by someone with 3 dogs and one of them attacked her.  So once she arrived at the shelter she was actually terrified of the other dogs.  But given slowintroductions to a new dog she is does quiet well with them. In fact for quite some time she was even fostered in a home with 3 other dogs.  She has also lived in a home with a cat and would likely do well in a home with a cat that is dog savvy.\n\nDelilah is housebroken and crate trained.  Although she is could likely be left in the house uncrated without any issues.  \n\nWe strive very hard to make sure that our dogs are placed in the proper homes.  It is important to us that it is right for the dog as well as the adopter.  So that being said, Delilah does have a few quirks. She sometimes becomes startled at certain objects (when bicycles go by, skateboards, etc) and when she does she is gets a bit jumpy at the end of a leash.  She needs an owner who is going to understand her fear based issues and be ok dealing with them. Continued exposure to these things have not helped so avoidance may be the best option.  That is why we feel that a home in the country where she won\u2019t encounter the sounds and sometimes overwhelming things urban life brings might be best.\n\nAs much as we love to see our adopters bring their dogs everywhere with them, in this case we are looking for a laid back home in the country where Delilah can just be herself.  Where she can relax with her people and hang out around the house without the stress of walking on busy streets and encountering things that make her nervous.  So if you live in the country and think you might be just the right spot for Delilah please Fill out our adoption application.  We would love to talk to you!\n\n** Adoption fee $50 \u2013 the balance has been sponsored by volunteers who love her **",

She has some dog friends but can be picky so would likely do best as the only dog in the home.  \n\nHope is crate, leash, and house trained.  \n\nCould you be the home this beauty has been waiting for?  If so, apply today at FYDRadopt.com so we can see if she would be a good fit!  \n\nShe is spayed, microshipped, up-to-date on vaccines, and on heartworm preventative.  Her adoption fee is $175.

Hank will require an experienced, smart pack leader because he tries to Horn in on whoever is being petted at the time and he tries to take over.

You see, I was diagnosed with a heart condition last year and things weren't looking so good. I'm much better now and doing great on my heart medications, fish oil, and yummy high quality food. I enjoy lots of loving care with my foster family, but I would really love a family of my own. Are you that special someone that loves older, wiser gentleman needing some extra care?\n\nI mostly ignore other dogs. I prefer easy-going, mellow dogs rather than rowdy dogs that jump on me. I did great with my intro to the office cat. I could share a home with cats as long as they are friendly and well mannered.\n\nWhen you come to visit be sure and ask for me. I'm the silly boy with the big smile, happily greeting old and new friends that come to visit. I\u2019d love to be your new best friend. I can't wait to meet you!\n\nBenny is about 8 years old, neutered, crate trained and up to date on shots. His heart medication makes him very thirsty and he then needs to pee a lot. Easy access and a dog door to a fenced yard would be ideal for Benny. Also a home where his person is retired or works from home. He is currently staying with SevaDog Rescue. Canine Miracle Rescue and SevaDog Rescue are working together to help Benny find his perfect family.",

Dallas knows basic commands and is treat motivated. He has gone through obedience training and needs an owner that will keep up on his training,  This boy is a strong boy who is about 65lbs. He does ok with other dogs but we are unsure with cats as he's never been around them. He will need slow, proper intros to other dogs. Dallas does need a fenced in yard as he doesn't do well on a tie out. He would do best in a home with older children and an experienced handler. If you're interested in this adorable boy, please fill out the adoption form below: \nhttp://providingforpaws.org/adoption-and-foster-forms.html",

You have to be careful \u2013 if he snuggles up next to you on the couch, you are likely to be lulled into a nap by his warm little snuggly self. Blue is a very happy boy and is happiest when he has people and other dogs around. He is scared of loud noises, but I don't blame him since he can't see if he's in danger or not by the noise. Blue is very brave and adaptable - he got used to our house in no time and gets around perfectly fine.",

            "description": "Kasper has gotten pretty comfy at his foster home already and is full of love and young Boxer energy. He is pretty strong on the leash and loves to play so he will need LOTS of exercise and play time to make him happy. A home with a fenced in yard would be best for him. Kasper is said to have formerly lived with a 12 year old child and is very sweet with the 7 year old child in his foster home. He has been reactive when on the leash on walks and doesn't seem to be very socialized with other dogs. Kasper would very likely be happier in a home with no other dogs. He has not been around cats.UPDATE: Kasper will be starting formal training to work on his reactivity with other dogs and to work on some manners and basic obedience. He has been in some training and daycare activities and has done very well with other dogs so far!! UPDATE FROM KASPER'S FOSTER MOM: Kasper is a sweet boy and knows many commands like sit, shake and stay. He loves his toys too. He is high energy and really likes to be near his people. He is reactive with other dogs and lunges at them while on leash. He also barks out the window when he sees other dogs. He has attended doggie daycare and did okay- but not one on one while on leash. He does play rough while at daycare. Kasper is very treat motivated as well. He can be vocal when he wants to play. He is a typical young boxer. 2/2/21 1:49 PM",

I am up to date on my vaccines, neutered and heart worm negative.  I am currently being fostered in East Texas about 30 minutes north of Nacogdoches, TX.\n\nI found myself abandoned in Houston, TX during Hurricane Harvey.  I was pretty scared and admit I was not very cooperative with those who were trying to help me get to safety.\n\nI am looking for a family or human who will have lots of patience with me.  I am still a little scared when I meet new people and especially new dogs.  I like people but just need to know that I can trust them.  I also can get a long with other dogs who are calm and submissive.  I need a family who will love me, not make me a backyard ornament, play with me and never abandon me.\n\nI like to run around the yard and chase balls and rope toys.  I can sit and shake.\n\nIf you would like to meet me, please contact Penny by texting or calling her @ 713-824-2737 or emailing her @ pennykbryce@gmail.com\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon,\nRusty",

I'm athletic and clever and just so personable. Or so they tell me!\n\nOne thing I don't mind saying about myself is that I aim to please. I'm a great walker \u2013\u2013 no pulling on the leash or chasing after squirrels for me! I'm also very gentle when I play.\n\nEven with all of that going for me, I seem to be best known for my ears. The ears curl back, just a little, giving me a very distinctive, rakish look.\n\nBut enough about me \u2013\u2013 what about you? Come down and tell me all about yourself. I promise I'll listen carefully to your every word so I know just how to make you happy.\n\n* Fast Friends adopts in the New England area.

            "description": "There's something wrong with your couch...it doesn't have Ruby Dee curled up on it. We saved Miss Ruby, our 6ish year old Pitbull mix, from a high kill shelter where she came in as an owner surrender. Like so many dogs we rescue, she contracted an upper respiratory infection, which quickly worsened. Unfortunately, after battling and beating pneumonia, she was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. She then settled in with a new long-term foster and we have been closely monitoring her condition with an oncologist ever since. So far so good because while her leukemia cannot be cured, it is progressing very slowly. Shhhh\u2026don't tell Ruby she's sick because she doesn\u2019t know and you would never know it either. Our 35lb. goofball has a zest for life that is completely contagious and her love for toys may only be rivaled by her obsession with sun bathing. She is all about playing and spending time in the yard on warm days (with supervision of course). Good news -- she is also perfectly content to cuddle up on the couch for a good snuggle session, preferably tucked behind your legs and under a blanket. Our gem of a \"pocket pittie\" is extremely intelligent and eager to please (she is a \u201csit, stay, go to your bed\u201d champ) and she will quickly win you over with her signature snorts and snores. Pitbull/Piglet mix? It's possible. While Ruby Dee can be iffy with cats and selective with other pups, her love for people and LIFE make her all the dog you need. Ruby will flourish with an active family (no kiddos please!) who want to take her along on all their adventures and then invite her up on the couch for a nap or movie night. Ruby Dee is housebroken when kept on a schedule, crate trained, spayed, vaccinated, heartworm negative and microchipped. Despite her diagnosis, we do not feel Ruby is a hospice dog and anticipate she has many wonderful years ahead of her. Stop staring at your empty sofa! Ruby's ready and waiting!

Meeko was purchased as a pup, and in the two years he was with his original family his upper canines were pulled.  \n\nAlthough there was another dog in the home Meeko did not know how to \"dog.\" He would greet other dogs with piloerect fur while barking in their face.  His barking was more so stranger danger than aggression; Meeko never pushed past that point.  However it was no way for him to \"win friends and influence strangers.\"\n\nMeeko plays well with other dogs.  He is a little boisterous when he becomes excited.  He does occassionally have anxiety when crated; we use a Vari Kennel Ultra with a couple of black trucker bungees in the front tie down holes. Meeko would do best in an active, patient, home with a husky companion, and a physically fenced yard.  We will not place Meeko in a home with children as he was very distrustful of the child in his home.\n\nFor additional information or an adoption application please email... kaleidoscopek9s@yahoo.com",

            "description": "2- 3 year old Louie came to us with a history of being a \"bait dog\" for dog fighters.  That may or may not be true as Louie does seem to have some neurological issues which could have been caused by injury (head bobbing when drinking, and some peripheral vision issues).  We have had Louie thoroughly checked out by our veterinarian, and he has assured us that though Louie does seem to have some strange issues, none of them appear to be affecting his current health in any way nor does he expect them to affect him in the future.  Louie really doesn't care for the company of other dogs - he would much rather be an \"only furchild\".  He is very well behaved on leash.  He can be affectionate with his humans once he gets to know them, but can be a bite risk to those he does not know or trust.  Louie needs someone with a LOT of patience and knowledge of dog behaviors to adopt him and show him just how good a dog's life can be, therefore,  Louie would do best in a home with an experienced dog owner/trainer, and absolutely no children.  Louie is a work in process - and his new family should regard him as a piece of art that when finally complete will dazzle all who meet him.  If you would like to offer Louie a forever home, please submit an application which you can find on our website (www.almostheaven-golden-retriever-rescue.org)",

He's always in a good mood, he loves life and he loves to give kisses. Noah is super entertaining, he will make you smile all day. Noah is currently receiving professional obedience training and is up for any adventure. Noah will need an adult home (no children) with a yard (no apartment situations) and someone to love! He's wonderfully behaved in the home and super silly.\nThank you for your interest in adopting/fostering. Please make sure to read the dog's bio carefully. We get to know the dogs very well to make sure, they find the right match for their forever home. Due to limited staff during this crisis, please only contact us, if you meet the basic criteria listed in the dog's bio.

Let me tell you my story....\n\nI was living life on the streets when I was just a pup, until one day when I ran out in front of my foster mom's car by Owen Rd. I was seriously \nemaciated- nothing but skin and bones....and I had tons of icky worms.\n\nFoster mom scooped me up and put me in her car and she did a \"stray hold\" to see if anyone was missing me. Of course, nobody was. I had been alone for a while. \n\nFoster mom soon realized that I had a rough beginning, when I saw dogs bigger than me I would shake with fear. She thinks I had to compete for food with bigger dogs when I was alone and they scare me now. Because of this, I would prefer being someone's one and only furbaby!\n\nI am 3 years young. I'm a petite little pittie at 40 pounds. I love doing things and going on adventures! Foster mom has taken me hiking, I enjoyed it. \nI also love to zoom zoom in backyard. I think I would love to run with a human! Stuffy toys are my favorite and I am the master of destuffing.\n\nI love humans of all sizes. I love giving everyone I meet a hug & a sloppy kiss!\n\nI am seeking a home where:\n- Humans will crate me when they are away\n- I can get mental and physical exercise\n- Training is incorporated into my life\n- I am the one and only fur baby (no kitty cats, no dogs)\n- Not looking to go to the dog park/dog bar\n\nBefore emailing- please read:\n- Yes, this dog is available for adoption\n- The adoption fee for Owen is $256\n- Apply at c2cnd.org\n- The adoption fee covers their age appropriate shots, microchip, deworming, spay/neuter, and any other medical expenses while in our care.\n- Local adopters only. Due to our thorough adoption process including home visits, we limit our adoptions to local families in the greater Charlotte area.\n- If you have any additional questions, email us at dogs@c2cnd.org and we will respond as soon as possible!",

            "description": "Birthdate: 6/15/2015\n\nBreed: One of a kind\n\nSkywalker is a handsome 5 year old guy. He loves taking long walks and is very affectionate with everyone he meets. This boy is super mellow and trots along on his walks just taking in the world around him. Skywalker is always down with some quality time with you just to hang and gives out some kisses. He is such a snuggle monster.\n\nSky loves his toys, and would do best in a home without younger children as he doesn't always know how to share them. He would love someone who understands him, and has some experience as a dog owner. Our Sky really just wants to have a person he can call his own. Fill out our dog adoption application online at pawscrossedny.org to meet this dreamy Jedi. \n\n*Skywalker is on a training plan and requires more than one visit with our Behavior team. If you are interested in meeting Skewalker, please contact us at adoptions@pawscrossedny.org for more information!*\n\nBefore you can adopt sweet Skywalker, please complete an adoption application on our website at pawscrossedny.org! Once your application is approved, you will receive a link to schedule an appointment online. If you have any questions about Skywalker, please email us at adoptions@pawscrossedny.org for more information. Please understand we cannot hold any pet. All adoptions are done on a first come, first adopt basis for approved applicants.\n\nThe Shelter software system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of our dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We encourage you to select your new companion by considering each dog's individual personality and pet qualities instead of relying on a breed label that is only a guess.",

I'm sugar sweet, loving and friendly to all big and small. I'm housebroken, crate trained and need some further leash training, but I'm quick to learn and eager to please. My only vice is that I'm not fond of living with other dogs so its best if I'm a SOLO DOG because I like to hog all the attention, but I'm especially not fond of small dogs so city living is probably not for me.   I've not met any cats but I think my instinct would be to chase them so prefer NO CATS. I'm medium active but love to go running so if you need a jogging partner I would be up for it! Otherwise I'm a easy going dog in the home and will be your forever loyal shadow in no time! Please come meet/adopt me today!!\n\nFor more info/app; pls email: INFO@TAILSOFLOVERESCUE.ORG",

This is a courtesy posting for Brandy, who lives in the Bullard, TX area. Please e-mail Brandy at shadowgathering13@gmail.com if you're interested in adopting Valentine after reading his profile.  Dog breed pictures don't positively identify what breed(s) Valentine is without a DNA test.  His body slightly resembles a Greyhound body, and his head and ears resemble a Terrier breed.\n\nBrandy found Valentine as a puppy around 6 months old so she doesn't know his history before finding him, really loves him, and will continue to care for him until she can find just the right home for him that can spend more time with him. He spends a lot of time in his outside kennel during her long work hours, and she wants a better quality of life for him. He is 3 to 4 years old, current on vaccinations as of 11/22/18, heartworm negative, knows basic commands, and is neutered. He is protective of his property from people and other dogs while inside the fence of his property. Off his property, his behavior is not as protective, and would be a good guard dog for someone with no children. He does require a secure fenced yard. He is good with a few other dogs that he lives with, and a dog down the road. He might be good with other dogs once he gets to know them, but his initial reaction to new people and dogs is defensive. It's not always the same; just situational.\n\n$50 adoption fee.",

New people are just a little bit scary to me so I hide in the corner or put my face in the blanket and make myself as small as possible to avoid contact with strangers.  This is why I haven't been adopted yet.   I do love to play once I gain my confidence and it helps me to have another dog around.  I'd love to find a quiet home with a yard to play in and of course another dog for companionship.  \n\n\nAll C.A.R.E rescue dogs are fully vaccinated, heart-worm tested, spayed/neutered, and dogs are microchipped! So all you need to provide is the love.\n\nFill out an adoption application here: http://www.carerescue.org/dog-adoption\n\nOur adoption fee is a minimum $100 tax deductible donation. All donations are used for rescue and medical care of animals in need. If you don't have room to take home a pet but want to support our efforts to save animals in need, please consider making a donation. We are not city or state funded and rely solely on private donations that allow us to continue saving lives.\n\nTo learn more about us or to give a life saving donation please visit http://www.carerescue.org",

            "description": "Trooper was found under an overpass in Fresno in a box full of water. He was painted purple, and unable to use his back end...had obvious injuries. So a good Samaritan reached out to us to help. Our vet found two bullets in him. One in his leg which they were able to remove and another lodged in his spine, which was causing the paralysis. We then took him to a neurologist at UC Davis, where Dr Toyota confirmed that he was permanently paralyzed due to the location of the bullet and that surgery or therapy would not help this. So the vets left the bullet.\nHe will come with his cart and his drag bag but he gets around great as is.\n****PLEASE DO NOT CALL TO CHECK STATUS OF A DOG...PHONE CALLS ARE FOR EMERGENCIES ONLY. EMAIL US WITH ANY QUESTIONS ON ADOPTION AS WE DO NOT GET BACK TO PHONE CALLS ABOUT ADOPTION.\nShots up to date (DHPP), wormed, micro chipped, altered (spayed/neutered). We also now give one free vet visit with our local vet within first 3 days of adoption!!\nAdoption cost for this dog is $150\nWe are a rescue, and although we have a facility in Modesto most of our dogs/pups are currently being fostered in or around our area. So please be willing to make the trip to see them if you are from out of the area. Our adoption process REQUIRES that an application must first be submitted and approved prior to meeting any of our pets. Just note that we may get several responses on one pet at a time so just because you have an approved application does not mean said pet is on hold for you. One must FIRST confirm an appointment to meet the pet after an approved application has been sent. To inquire about this specific pet, please write to info@pupznpalz.org for an application. Please remember to put the pets name in the subject line when emailing, and on the top on the application. It helps us to help you that must faster. We are a group of volunteers, and ask that you please bare with us. We will get to each person just as quickly as we can. If you do not hear back from us within 24 hours, please send another request as we have been having problems with e-mail.\nemail: info@pupznpalz.org and ask for an application for which dog you are interested in\nphone: 209-480-8662 (9-6 pm only please, cell phone, emergencies only please...do not call to ask status of dog, email please)\n**ADOPTION EVENTS: typically every Sat at Modesto Petco 2021 Evergreen Ave from 12-3\n**OUR FACILITY: Located at 1430 Carpenter Lane Suite B (by appointment only as we do not have set hours)\n2/2/21 10:16 AM",

This poor guy in in an outdoor kennel, albeit a 48 x 25 size, but when loose he wants to hunt and play in the dirt...so for his safety from coyotes and the road at the end of our very long driveway, he is stuck outside...\n\nWhat a shame............\n\nBEAUTIFUL dog when cleaned up, but it is hard to get a good photo of him until he runs out some of the \"caged up energy\", so these are the best I have at the moment...  Sorry! ! ! \n\nSWEET temperament, a bit reserved, for a few seconds, he was one of five pups we took this summer after being abandoned, then taken to  a vet office in Butler County.  \n\nWe have NO clue of true identity genetically, so we guess Schnauzer and Lab according to the other pups.  He also has two sisters who have smooth coats and look Lab and Rat Terrier (Shelby still needs to be adopted).  One sister looks like him is already adopted.   \n\nHe needs a dog savvy family.  Leash work just started and he is scared of the leash...  So he is needing work. \n\nMature weight at about 40 to 45 pounds.  \n\nAdoption fee is $250. \n\nTo adopt call Marilyn at 573-722-3035 from 9:30am to 9:30pm CENTRAL TIME. Please leave your telephone if you send us a request to adopt so I can contact you! (:>))\n\nWe may be able to help with transport. We ship all over the USA. \n\nYou can help us by sharing posts of our dogs on your FB page and by email to friends. \n\nIf you like music, check out our SAXOPHONE CD that is easy listen music that the pets will even like!  Michael Neville donated his CD to help the pets!  Go to our Website to download single songs for $.99 cents each OR download all 13 classic tunes for just $9.99. Simple, fast to do and YOU get something back when you donate to us! \n\nWant to purchase a hard copy fancy dancy CD (it is beautifully packaged)?  To receive a hard copy donate $20 or more and we will include shipping! \n\nYou can listen to four sample songs at this link: \nhttp://www.bcstrayproject.org/support-thru-music/ \n\nYou can also donate and get the DOWNLOAD versions at the above link!\n\nTo receive a beautiful packaged HARD COPY go to this link: \nhttp://www.bcstrayproject.org/make-a-donation/\n\nDonate $20 or more then send us an email at   ace@clas.net   and tell us you would like us to ship you a CD.  GIVE US YOUR ADDRESS and telephone number in your email so we can ship and contact you if there are any questions.    \n\nTHANK YOU for your support and for shopping for a rescue pet!",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Maynard was just 3 months old when he, his mom Violet, and two siblings were picked up by animal control in rural Oklahoma. They were picked up from a property where they were in the pasture with goats. Animal control had to use a \"catch-pole\" to catch them because the whole little family was showing a fair amount of fear-based aggression. Sadly, the animal control officer made the decision to euthanize one puppy, saying s/he was too aggressive. It's really hard to imagine a 3-month old puppy being so aggressive that an experienced person couldn't have dealt with the issue, but seeing that the \"shelter\" was willing to put down a puppy, one local person volunteered to foster Violet and her remaining two puppies until she could find a rescue to take them in.\n\nWhen we brought them here, the puppies (whom we named Nell and Maynard) were very frightened, and they tried to avoid my attempts to touch them, but they were never aggressive. They simply acted like feral pups who had ZERO experience with humans, other than their very unfortunate interaction with animal control.\n\nMaynard and his sister Nell are in a foster home where they are making slow progress in accepting humans. They enjoy playing with the family's Great Pyrenees and are much more relaxed with HER than with humans.\n\nIf you have the patience and compassion to love Maynard and work with him to overcome his difficult start in life, please complete the application on our website at www.bluebonnetrescue.org.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Violet is a bit of a mystery to us -- from her breed/s to her history, there's a lot more that we DON'T know than we DO know. We DO know that Violet was picked up by animal control in rural Oklahoma, along with three puppies who were estimated to be 3 months old. They were picked up from a property where they were in the pasture with goats. Animal control had to use a \"catch-pole\" to catch them because the whole little family was showing a fair amount of fear-based aggression. Sadly, the animal control officer made the decision to euthanize one puppy, saying s/he was too aggressive. It's really hard to imagine a 3-month old puppy being so aggressive that an experienced person couldn't have dealt with the issue, but seeing that the \"shelter\" was willing to put down a puppy, one local person volunteered to foster Violet and her remaining two puppies until she could find a rescue to take them in.\n\nWhen we brought them here, the puppies (whom we named Nell and Maynard) were very frightened, and they tried to avoid my attempts to touch them, but they were never aggressive. They simply acted like feral pups who had ZERO experience with humans, other than their very unfortunate interaction with animal control. Violet, on the other hand, showed a fair amount of aggression any time I approached the kennel and dog run where I put her together with her puppies. When it came time to take her to the vet for her spay surgery, I was able to get a leash on Violet and take her to the vet. From that point forward, Violet stayed in the house and was not returned to the area where her puppies stayed until they, too, were old enough for spay/neuter surgery. Once she was no longer protecting her pups, Violet settled in to life as a couch potato, and she acted so comfortable that we felt sure she must have had a home at some point in her history. Perhaps she lived in the house with her first family, but then was dumped out in the country when she got pregnant, and turned into a semi-feral dog, doing whatever it took to take care of her little family. She has become very protective of our home, and is not AT ALL welcoming to visitors -- she barks almost non-stop and will nip at strangers. If we have visitors, we typically put Violet in a crate in another room, which is something we do with a few dogs who are so protective of home and family that they don't like visitors. Dogs such as Violet typically do fine when they leave our home -- Violet behaved very nicely at the vet's office, and I am confident that she can transfer her affection to a new family.\n\nViolet is VERY playful, and gets along with all the dogs in our home. One of her favorite play mates is a smaller dog who is about half her size. She also plays with dogs of her own size, and she doesn't discriminate based on gender.\n\nAs for her breed/s, we've just made a guess based on her looks, size, protective nature, and the fact that she was living with goats. She is NOT a livestock guardian, but we think it's possible that she is at least part Great Pyrenees. The red ticking in her white coat reminds us of a Red Heeler, but her stout frame and the curl of her tale make us think of an Akita. She has a BIG bark, so whatever her ancestry may be, she definitely acts like a guardian for her home and human family. She would be a great companion and protector for a single person who lives a quiet life without a lot of visitors.\n\nIf Violet sounds like exactly the dog for you, please complete the application on our website at www.bluebonnetrescue.org.",

Dash loves everyone and gets along great with the pugs in his foster home.  He does need eye meds twice a day to keep his eyes moist and gets a daily supplement for his arthritis. His  back end is a bit wonky but he  gets where  he wants to go just fine.  He loves to be with his human and one of his favorite spots is on the back of the sofa when his human sits down.  Dash frequently will suck on a stuffed toy and fall asleep with it.   He also likes to sleep with his human and will get under the covers at times. He has good house manners but you need to go out with him to be sure he goes potty.  Because of his arthritis and back end issues, Dash will sometimes leak but a belly band helps with that.  Although Dash will go into a crate, it is not his favorite thing to do.  Dash is going to make some lucky family a perfect new member.",

Or meet our beloved Duchess, a 2 year-old beauty who was born to play! She loves playing with dogs, toys, and humans--if there is fun to be had, this dog-loving, toy-crazy, and passionate people-pleaser will find it. Duchess lights the world up with her joy, and all the more extraordinary is that she does it with perfect manners. If you'd rather read on the couch, she is happy to curl up next to you, or--and we find this most endearing--amuse herself quietly with a toy. This extraordinary dog was rescued from a high kill shelter where she won accolades from staff and volunteers alike, lauded for being a perfect dog for any kind of family; she is just as impressive in her foster home. The only thing this adorable, adaptable being is missing is a forever playmate (or two, or three) to call her own. If you are able to open your home and your heart, Duchess is guaranteed to bring on the fun--and a whole lot of love.",

            "description": "Cupid is an almost 3 year old girl who needs a home with someone who has time and patience for training. She didn't get much of that in her previous home, so she's essentially a great big puppy who hasn't learned all the ins and outs of manners. Cupid is incredibly smart and very motivated by treats as well as attention from people. She's eager to please, but needs clear instructions on what's expected of her. Being a very young and active dog, her new home should be ready to give her plenty of physical activity as well as mental stimulation. Cupid is going to take some patience, but she is SO worth it. She gives excellent hugs and has a great smile! At this point in her training, she needs to find a home without children, cats, or small animals. She never learned the proper ways to interact with other dogs, and her attempts at play can be seen as rude. With someone who is willing to work with her in the beginning, she could very well learn to be happy to have another big dog as a friend.\n\n\nPlease give the shelter a call at 508-586-2053 between 1:00 and 4:00 any day except Monday or Wednesday, or email info@apcsm.org to get more information about this pet and our adoption process. Please note- the shelter is closed to walk-through-traffic at this time. Meets are scheduled with an adopter after speaking with an adoption counselor, and an application has been approved for a particular animal.\n",

He is fine with visiting dogs and dogs we meet on the street. He is the most fun loving dog I have had. He loves to snuggle, go for walks and loves rides in the car. He gives the best kisses. His medical needs are being met, but the Cushing's is only treatable and can't be cured. We are working on his jumping on visitors. He is doing better with the command, down. He listens well to most other commands such as stay, sit, wait, go lay down and come.",

She was not able to thrive at the shelter and so we were so grateful when her foster hero came. At home, she is playful and happy. She loves to learn and is eager to please. \n\nUnfortunately, she will likely always be wary of new and novel things, but her confidence is building every day. She would do best in a home without children or other dogs because of this. She needs a quiet and committed family, but that family is going to be so lucky to have her. She will pay them back with lifetime loyalty, love, and affection.",

She is a gorgeous 20 pound Cocker/Border Collie mix, and about 4 years old.\u00a0 Princess Ariel is back with us after a failed adoption due to no fault of hers OR the adopter, we learn more about each dog as their environment changes and we learned that Ariel needs an experienced adopter. She is a little pushy and likes to resource guard, but corrects well when her human calmly but assertively \"takes charge\".\n\nPrincess Ariel is a champion snuggeler and wants nothing else but a cuddle buddy to hang out with all day long. She is looking for a home that has the time and patience to give her the attention she needs and craves. She could live with another dog as long as her human stays \"in charge\", but would do best as an only dog. It does take her some time to warm up to new people\u00a0and she is not a fan of kids, so an adult only home or teenage kids or up would be best.\n\nAriel is looking for a dog-experienced home, preferably as an only dog and no kids. Ariel can be vocal around strangers, so she may not be a good fit for apartment living. We are happy to provide guidance on her training, she has been working with one of our trainers and continuing that training would be vital to her success in a new home.\u00a0\n\n***** Please note that not every dog comes to every adoption day, so if you would like to meet a specific dog on adoption day, please contact us so we can make arrangements accordingly. \n\nAdoption Application are available at: http://www.twyla.org/adopt/adoption-application",

He is heartworm negative & is fully vetted, including microchipped.\nHe would do well with a family whom he could bond with & have a wonderful life.  He's a VERY sweet boy.

            "description": "Meet Mandy! She is super sweet! She LOVES attention. Mandy prefers calm, large male dogs and not so much females, small dogs or cats. Teenage children would be best. She is about 8 years old, vaccinated, spayed, house and crate trained, microchipped and ready for a home to call her own. Mandy came in heartworm positive and went through slow kill treatment, and recently had a negative follow up test! She has recently developed some small mammary tumors and due to her age we opted to just watch them for now. She loves her stuffed toys especially her little lamb toy. Mandy is being fostered near Tulsa, OK. For more information please email us. PLEASE NOTE: Adopters are only considered with a completed adoption application and home visit. Please visit our website http://bullmastiff.us/rescue to apply or to make a donation toward the care of our homeless Bullmastiffs.",

Reacher was taken to the county shelter after his owner passed away and no one wanted him.  He was there almost 6 weeks until a special lady came to his rescue!  He has had surgery to remove several fatty tumors, is now on joint supplements and a healthy diet.  His improvement and increase in energy is amazing.  Reacher loves to play ball, of course he has to be limited since he will keep on going!  He enjoys going for walks and most of all he loves being with people.  This is one happy guy now that life is good!  He appears to be smiling all of the time and eager to play a game of tug with his favorite toy.  We are working on a weight loss program to get his weight down, he is now about 80 pounds and doing great!  Reacher is a very special guy with so much love to give!\nReacher has been neutered, is up to date on all vaccinations, tested negative for heartworms and is on monthly prevention.  He will be microchipped prior to adoption.\nFor more information on Reacher, our adoption process and to complete an application, please contact us by email at allaboutdogscr@gmail.com or visit our website allaboutdogscr.com",

            "description": "My name is Holly and I was rescued from a central valley shelter.  The shelter wanted to euthanize me because of my severe skin allergies but I was saved because my rescuers knew they could help heal me and help me stay well.  I have spent the last year working so hard to find out what I'm allergic to and what I need to eat and what medicines to take to keep my skin comfortable.  I'm considered a bit of a \"special needs\" pup because I must stay on a special formulation of food and I require monthly medications, but I'm normal in every other way.  I'm just a sweet girl that wants to be loved. I am about 5 years old. \n\nI really, really love my humans. I could follow you around all day long and give you so much attention and affection. I am hopeful someone wants to invite me into their lives and help me stay well.  I am smaller sized pittie at only about 50 lbs and I am crate trained so I'm easily managed in the house. I find cats to be too tempting though so I should be in a home without any felines.  \n\n\nNote: While we helped Holly heal on the outside, we have also invested in training for her to help her feel safe and secure on the inside and not be so afraid of other dogs.  She is doing remarkably well as she has built up her confidence and is able to play nicely with other dogs and make friends.  Holly will do best with a dog savvy handler who will understand her and continue to provide her a safe and secure environment.  \n\nPlease note that we will provide financial support to her new adopter/family to ensure her health routine for the very best future possible.",

Raffi is shy with people he does not know but warms up once he gets to know you and feels safe.  It does take him time to come out of his shell so he will need someone who is patient.  He has limited hearing but he can hear louder sounds. He will need an experienced owner as he needs guidance and someone to build his confidence.  Raffi loves other dogs and he will need a home with another confident dog that he can watch and learn from.  He is good with cats too. He will need a calm household where he is not left for long hours and no young children but calm older children are okay.  Raffi loves to go on walks and rides well in the car.

It is believed that he was beaten until his back was broken. His owners brought Harry and his brother to a shelter where they were both going to be put to sleep. They believed Harry was unadoptable and his brother would be too sad without him. They were both rescued and Harry quickly took to his wheelchair. His brother happily found a family of his own.\nHarry is part Golden Retriever and is about 3 years old.\nHarry has a strong personality. He is confident in his adorableness and rightly believes that everyone should love him at first sight. He is a strong believer in getting kisses and hugs before being put to bed and insists on it. \nHarry needs a fenced in yard so he can run fill tilt in his wheels. He currently lives on a farm with a nature trail where he runs laps, digs in the woods and chases the farm animals whenever possible.\nHarry requires daily care. He needs a bath at least once a day as he does not have control of his bathroom functions. He loves diapers. Not to wear, just to rip up and shred. He also loves to take diapers off his other wheelie friends. He's a bit of a rascal that way.\nHarry weighs about 60 pounds. Potential adopters will need to lift him for baths and to help him in and out of his wheel chair.\nHarry loves people of all sizes. Kids 12 years and up, who are fast movers would be best (and no small dogs) because Harry drives his wheels as if he learned from playing Grand Theft Auto. He runs over everyone that doesn't get out of his way. He loves whipping Louies (Doughnuts?) In the snow and mud. He strongly believes that he's living the dream and he's full of joy.\nThere is a certain amount of work that goes along with caring for Harry (And I mean work of the poop cleaning variety) but he is quite a remarkable dog that bring happiness and laughter.\nThis pup does not have control of bathroom functions.  Baths will be required daily and Living area will have to be created, such as in a play pen where there is soft bedding that can be changed out  couple times a day.\nTo meet Harry, apply at emotionalrescuemn.org.",

He tends to 'talk'.  Claimed to be in stages of kidney disease he has put on weight and is doing well.  He is not a cuddler and prefers his own space and often sleeping outside.  \nHe will benefit from food and love.

He came to rescue from Ruin Creek NC and has recovered nicely from the horrible condition we found him in: he was emaciated, needed a blood transfusion, was covered in open wounds and scars, including a large infected wound down the bridge of his nose, and a piece of his tail just fell right off! This poor boy didn't deserve the poor treatment he endured prior to rescue and we want him to be comfortable and loved for the rest of his life. Stryker loves people. He is very strong, so an adopter with large dogs would be best. His home should have a fenced-in yard and no other pets; Stryker needs to be king of his castle. He is up to date on shots and is neutered. If you would like to adopt Stryker, please put your application in here: http://www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Our precious girl Willow is a female Pit mix girl born in approximately December 2017 and rescued in Texas. Poor Willow found herself alone and scared at a very high kill shelter suffering from serious burns down her back. Rescue Dogs Rock NYC pulled Willow out as soon as we saw her and she immediately received the medical care she required. Fast forward, and Willow is a sweet girl with a big, funny personality who loves to play with her toys. Willow is housebroken, walks nicely on a leash and knows basic commands. She loves to cuddle and sleep under the covers. Willow is a rough and tumble girl and would do best in a home with older children as she can be jumpy. She loves her bones and is sometimes a bit protective of them. Willow is not a fan of cats and would be happier as the only dog in her forever home. Willow needs a special someone to come along, fall in love, and be patient with her as she grows and gains confidence and forgets all about her horrible past. Are you the lucky one that can give this beautiful girl the wonderful life that she is so deserving of?! She is friendly with people of all ages, up to date on vaccinations and will be spayed prior to joining in her forever home. If you would like to give Willow her happy ever after, please fill out an adoption application for her here! Http://www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org",

She's a good car rider, has been through basic obedience training, is crate trained and is waiting so patiently for a home so that she doesn't have to live at a boarding kennel. Update: Due to the pandemic, Meg has been lucky enough to get a foster home! See pictures here of Meg enjoying living with her foster family in a real home rather than the boarding kennel, https://www.flickr.com/photos/72942520@N00/albums/72157715288216657 She was found running on Rail Road tracks; an animal rescuer who picked her up out of harm's way. Meg is 64 pounds, born around 12-2016. She is spayed, current on vaccines and micro-chipped. She is super sweet and loving. Meg would be best as an only pet. She enjoys walks and spending quality time with her 'person'.

He is good with other dogs after a proper introduction is done. We do not  know how Sammy is with cats. He is working on consisting executing his basic commands and leash manners. Sammy would do best with children 15 years or older. His forever home is required to have a physically fenced yard where he can safely run and play. Sammy's vaccinations are up to date, he is neutered as well as crate trained. Sammy would love to become a part of an active family who will love and cherish him for the rest of his life.\n\nAll dogs we rescue stay with us until they find their forever homes. We do not do same day adoptions. A home visit is required to ensure our dog is going to a safe environment and our dog gets along with your dog(s) and/or cat(s). We require all our dogs over the age of 1 year attend 1 obedience class (6 week session) outside the home. You must live within 1 hour of Birmingham, MI to adopt one of our dogs. No out of state or outside the U.S. adoptions or fosters. Sammy's adoption fee is $275.",

            "description": "Nickie is a sweet dog that is calm and humble. He interacts with both people and other dogs in a gentle fashion. There is not a mean bone in his body and he is not at all aggressive. If pushed by an assertive dog, he may protect himself with a small snap, but it\u2019s a one and done warning to treat him more respectfully. He prefers to spend time with other dogs rather than by himself and tries to sneak on their pillow with them to take a snooze. He doesn\u2019t understand if they are less than welcoming since he is so friendly to all dogs that he meets. For Nickie, each dog he meets is instantly part of his circle of friends even if the affection is not returned. He keeps trying to teach them that together is better.\n\nNickie is trying to learn the house rules. It seems a little hard for him to grasp the concepts since he apparently spent the first 6 years of his life without much guidance or supervision. He is trying to master \u201cgo potty outside\u201d, \u201csit\u201d and \u201coff\u201d for starters, and is slowly progressing in his education. The fact that he loves all training treats is a strong positive. He doesn\u2019t have some of the more negative puppy behaviors like chewing on everything or racing around aggravating everyone, but rather enjoys just being near to his family (people and dogs). Of an evening, he is happy to spend time on your lap while watching TV.\n\nWhen he arrived in rescue, he had a respiratory infection, and needed a little time to recoup. Now he is over that, but he has had two seizures. We have started anti-seizure medication and hope it will control the condition. Other than that, he is healthy and happy. We feed Nickie in a crate because he is always ravenous, and I doubt he would respect the \u201cyour food and my food\u201d concept. He is currently underweight and is thin as a rail. We hope to fatten him up a little, but I believe he may have a slightly sensitive stomach, although this is hard to evaluate with all the vetting he has undergone in two short weeks. Now that the initial round of vetting is complete, we will be able to assess his digestive issues if there are any. Once he has a chance to settle down and relax, his digestion may improve.\n\nNicki is a little shy when he first meets you. This is a result of his past treatment (which is a mystery to us) and all the changes we have made to his life in the last 2.5 weeks (dogs don\u2019t generally like change). I believe Nickie is extremely brave to survive with his personality intact since he was dropped off in the night repository at the shelter without much ado. It has to be traumatic to be wisked up and dropped off at a totally new and unknown place without any indication that some kind person would provide care. For this reason, I\u2019m not surprised that loud voices and noises startle him, quick movements can frighten him and it takes some time for him to trust enough to wag his tail for folks. The tip of his tail by the way has a kink in it. We are not sure if he was born that way or if it was broken in his previous life. His tail doesn\u2019t appear painful, but it does seem a little sensitive.\n\nNicki does like to play with other dogs at a slower pace than the frantic puppy mode, and he will chew on flexible nylbones for entertainment. He is crate trained, but needs some to work on walking with a lead. If you have a gentle dog looking for companionship, please contact BRSM about Noodles Nicholas Charles. He can be your best friend as well as your dog\u2019s best friend. \n\nNoodle's Webpage - http://beaglemaryland.org/brsm_ms/vIndividualCurrentDog.aspx?dogid=69678\nAdoptable Dog Webpage - http://beaglemaryland.org/brsm_ms/vCurrentDogs.aspx\n\nIf you'd like to adopt one of our beagles:\n*Go to our Website - href=\"http://beaglemaryland.org\n*Review our  Standards for Adoption - http://beaglemaryland.org/Home.aspx?pg=standardsforadoption.htm\n*Fill out an Adopter Profile - http://beaglemaryland.org/new_site/documents/adopterprofilenew.htm\n and email it to us (or print it off, fill it in and send it via regular mail, if you prefer)\n*A BRSM volunteer will contact you to guide you through the rest of the process!\n\nWe hope to hear from you, and so do the beagles!",

She doesnt chew her beds..appears to be nearly 100% crate trained.. maybe 95% due to circumstances.\n\nShes doing great with two other bullies a female and male. Proper intro should be fine with other non aggressive dogs.\n\nWatch with alpha females\n\nShe's strong but walks nice on a leash..however does pull to some degree..but with some training her pulling will be minimized.\n\nWe will be interacting her with other dogs..so far brief encounters show no interest. \n\nShe was definitely a mom at some point but we know nothing about that. So far shes just been a sweetheart once she got over her fears of a new situation. \n\n Please remember to make sure that you include a phone number on any inquiry regarding our dogs it is very important that a phone number is included because sometimes the emails go into Spam and you do not see that we have replied we typically respond to inquiries within the 1st 24 hours they are recieved.

She has a lot of energy and would do well in an active home where she can get some exercise. She would make a great hiking/adventure buddy. She is good with the dogs her size here at the shelter. \n\nHer best home would be with a fenced yard with plenty of room to run and play. She is good with all people, big and small. She is active and fun and may knock down a smaller kiddo so 8 and older would be our preference. She is healthy and up on all her shots. Someone who knows the breed would be great.\n\nShe can be adopted locally or we can transport her to the East or the West Coast. If you are interested in adopting Ebony Anne, please contact Lytle Animal Care and Control at 830-709-3832. See her cute video.",

            "description": "Saoirse (Seer-sha), spayed female, approximate DOB 06/02/07, redbone coonhound, 52 lbs  Saoirse was an owner surrender at MCCACC as a bite case. Statements made by the owner said the wife was teasing Saoirse and Saoirse growled. The wife continued to tease her, so she bit the wife on the hand.  I ran full bloodwork on Saoirse and she is in perfect health.   She is very sweet and affectionate but does not like to have her nails trimmed or ears cleaned. She will snap at those things. There have been no other occasions where she has attempted to bite. While she likes my older dogs, she would do best in a single dog home. She will lunge and snap at the younger dogs when they play too close to her.  Despite her age, she is very active and loves to go on walks. She does well on a leash and knows basic commands.  She is house-broken and crate trained.  Due to her history, she cannot go to a home where there are children under 18. Saoirse is currently recovering from wounds received during a dog fight with one of my other dogs. If interested in more information about Saoirse call 480-375- 1785 \ncrazyrowan7@gmail.com \n",

            "description": "Tess is a beautiful 2 year old German Shepherd who weighs about 60 lbs.  She is spayed, up to date on shots, micro chipped, on heartworm and flea and tick prevention.  We expect that she will be a large sized dog when full grown (check out those paws)!\n\nYou may have also noticed the she is wearing a diaper.  That is because she is a special needs dog now likely at the hands of a cruel individual.  We suspect that she received some trauma when she was 6-8 weeks old (likely kicked) and of course received no vet care at the time of the incident.  Then she found herself in the shelter when just 3 months old.  The shelter had her broken tail amputated and had her spayed, but didn't realize her other injury.\n\nWe have been to the vet and there is nothing that can done to repair the nerve damage.  This will be a lifelong condition.  She is bowel incontinent (meaning she can't control her fecal output).  She has full functioning bladder control. \n\nI am not adopting her out to be an outside dog.  Period.  She is a beautiful girl who didn't ask for any of this and deserves to be an inside dog and live with a family.  She lives in my home. .  She will not be a lawn ornament.  No small children due to her puppy nature and antics.  Her \"special needs\" take me less then 15 minutes a day of extra time versus a regular dog. She does very well at keeping herself clean and I have covers on my furniture that are easily washable..  If you don't think she is worth an extra 15 minutes of your time a day, please move on to the next dog, because I can assure you she is worth every second of it!\n\nPlease don't apply for Tess out of pity for her, that would not be fair to her.  We are looking for the right family who understand what her special need is and what it will take to offer her a lifetime of care and support.  I know this may not be quick or easy .. and that is fine.  Tess is just fine living with me in my home, learning how to be an inside dog until the right family comes along.  She is perfect in every other way. She is smart, silly and a regular pup who loves to play, chase and chew toys!  She gets along with the other dogs in the home and has full run of the house with access to the back yard.  You must have a physically fenced yard, no exceptions.  \n\nIf you are serious about wanting to offer Tess a forever inside home, then please contact me at info@safehaventn.com and/or fill out the adoption application on our website www.safehaventn.com.  We will offer a 2 week trial adoption period to an approved adopter so you have a chance to fully realize what is involved in offering her a permanent place in your family. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read about this gorgeous girl, and if she is not the right fit for you, please share her profile so that the right family has a chance to find her!",

            "description": "**NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE**  ... We are so busy with rescuing and caring for animals and can't return everyone's inquiry.  If you are interested in adopting this pet...You must fill out the adoption application at:  \nhttp://www.marlcares.org/adopt_app-dog.php   (cut and paste into your browser) \nPLEASE READ all the following info.  We do not reply to inquiries asking if the dog is still available, if it is listed here, then it is still available.   \n\nMaddy's owners had to give her up because they lived in a town that had a breed ban...they did not allow pitbulls.  A neighbor reported them for having a pitbull and when the police came to take her and euthanize her...the owners wouldn't let them in and then late that night drove her  to someone who got to us.   Maddy lived with other dogs large and small and cats.  Her dad was a truck driver so she frequently went on long road trips with him....so she is always ready for a car ride and loves it and is a well mannered passenger.  She loves toys and balls.  She loves to cuddle and will snuggle in under the covers at night and keep your toes warm.  Maddy is very affectionate and very well behaved.  She loves everyone she meets and everyone loves her.  Maddy loves to play with other dogs and curl up with them when it is nap time.  Maddy was born Aug 5th 2017.  Maddy loves to play tug with other dogs.  Maddy is looking for a home that will love her and make her their BFF.\n\n$150 adoption fee, spayed/neutered, microchipped, current vaccinations, and currently kennel trained.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION:  If you are interested in this pet you must fill out the Adoption Application\u2026which you can find on this site or you can copy and paste this link \u2026 http://www.marlcares.org/adopt_app-dog.php    \nThis does not obligate you in any way.  If this does not work for you then you can email us at midsouthpets@aol.com for one.\n\nPLEASE DO NOT CONTACT US BEFORE READING THE FOLLOWING INFO: \nYour inquiry may not get a reply if you have not read the info we have taken the time to provide. PLEASE READ about our ADOPTION PROCESS AND REQUIREMENTS provided on this site before contacting us. You can find it quickly by clicking on our NAME or MORE ABOUT US in the column to the right of this pet\u2019s description. All your questions can be answered by reading the following info provided below. Our pets are fostered in the Memphis Area, a tri-state area, TN/AR/MS. Most are fostered in Red Banks, MS. \n\nWe do not allow meetings with any of our dogs until we have your Adoption Application. Adopting a new family member should involve a well-thought out and deliberate process. This is not an impulse purchase. Please understand that we do not want these animals to be homeless again. We try to complete the process as quickly as possible and appreciate all the applications and will consider each and every one we receive. \n\nFilling out the Adoption Application does not obligate you in any way, but simply tells us a little bit about you and whether you and this pet would be a good fit for each other. We will call you after we receive your application and answer all your questions and talk to you about this pet. After being approved, we will set up a time to bring the pet to meet you and your family and pets or set up a time for you to meet the pet at the foster home.\n\nNO PHONE CALLS PLEASE. Rescue is a full time job every day. Please know because we are so very busy with the dogs along with processing applications, updating webpage\u2019s, rescuing, in many vet appointments, caring for seniors and hospice dogs, etc, etc that we are not able to return phone calls or emails asking if this dog is still adoptable, how much is it to adopt, is it house trained etc\u2026We have included all the info we have on this dog at this current time and update the bio as we learn more about them. We kennel train all the dogs and will indicate if there are housebreaking issues that we have discovered. We update our site regularly so if the dog is listed here they are in fact adoptable, but may have applications coming in on them, so if you are interested, you need to get your application in now.\n\n**WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE ANY ADOPTION** Our first concern is the happiness and welfare of the animal. We respect our potential adoptors and appreciate your interest in adopting one of our pets. We care about you too and that you are getting the right fit for your home and lifestyle. By following our process, together we can make sure you are getting the right pet.**\n\nNOTE: We prefer to adopt in the Mid-South AREA, usually no more than 1-2 hours away in driving distance. It is up to the foster home, how far they are willing to drive. We rarely adopt long distance, but will consider each and every application. \n\nMidSouth Animal Rescue League is an all breed, 501c3, non-profit organization that prefer to rescue senior dogs and special cases. WE LOVE ROTTWEILERS...With 20 years of experience with our beloved ROTTWEILER breed, and little help for this breed in our area, we try to focus on rescuing them and try not to ever have to turn any away that need us\u2026especially the seniors that end up in shelters. Currently, we have several senior rottweilers in our hospice foster program. We always need more fosters so that we never have to say NO to them or other seniors. \n\nWe have also started a community relief effort specifically in the Red Banks, MS area not far from us, called The Dog House Project, where we go door to door providing dog houses to dogs on chains and other dogs and cats without proper shelter, including straw in cold temps, as well as food and other supplies as needed. We offer free spay/neuter services to those animals and continue to check on them all year. To date many have been spayed and neutered and some have been surrendered from their neglected lives on chains. We are making a difference and need your donations to continue this program. We always need igloo type dog houses. \n\nMidSouth Animal Rescue League relies on the kindness, generosity, and financial support of people like you so that we can continue to rescue and care for dogs like this one. We are a group of dedicated volunteers who respond to animals in need in shelters, strays, and from individuals. We receive no federal or state funds and are supported solely by private donations. \n\nMany of the animals we save are in need of special medical care or surgery to bring them back to health before they can be placed. Veterinary care, vaccinations, tests, x-rays, medications, spay and neutering, heartworm prevention, flea/tick prevention, worming, food, kennels, grooming, and other supplies are provided for each dog while in our care.",

She is up to date on shots and spayed. Manchester gets along well with all people and male dogs her size or larger with proper introductions. Manchester is not a fan of cats so a forever family with no feline residents would be the best fit for this beautiful girl. She has some ongoing skin issues and some allergies that can be controlled with medication. She absolutely loves to cuddle with her humans and will make the best snuggle partner! She is a smart girl who is crate and house trained. This special senior has been patiently waiting for a home to call her very own and is ready for that one person to see her gorgeous face, fall in love, and promise to love and adore her for the rest of her days! If that lucky person is you, please fill out an adoption application for our girl Manchester here! Http://www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org",

            "description": "Meet Jolie. Jolie is about 5 years old. She weighs 75 lbs. True to her breeds, Jolie is very well behaved, listens to every command and is very smart and personable. She will need someone with strong, gentle leadership skills, as most Catlle dogs she believes it is HER job to keep order in the home. For this reason Jolie will probably do best in a mature couples home with no small children and as an dominant dog. Jolie will offer companionship and protection. Jolie has never shown aggression towards a person, but would protect those she loves. Currently living inside a Foster Home where she has learned house manners. She is house trained, friendly and a good guard dog. She has been socialized with other dogs of all ages and sizes. Jolie needs a fenced in yard or a very active person family to keep her physically and mentally exercised. She walks great on a leash and would love activities such as hiking and exploring. Jolie needs her own person and/or Family to help her blossom to her true potential. She is spayed and UTD on her vaccines, micro-chipped and current with monthly heart worm preventive. Jolie is a dog who will need to be inside with you and outside for physical and mental stimulation. We will only consider homes that make their dog(s) a part of the family. \nIMPORTANT! PLEASE READ TO THE END. Included in NHR adoption Fee with all dogs and Puppies: UTD with Vaccines, Micro-Chipped, Spay/Neuter included, Treated for internal parasites, and living in a loving Foster Homes, and not a stressful Kennel environment. New Hope Rescue is a 501-C3 All Volunteer, Not for Profit Organization. All Proceeds are going to be used to help other rescue dogs and not to pay salaries. Because we are a small rescue we cannot transport out of our immediate area, however if you would like to arrange transportation we may be able to work with you. We will only consider homes that make their dog(s) a part of their Family.",

My  favorite playtime involves chasing my beloved basket ball - you throw it and I\u2019ll go around the GLOBE get it, or playing in the water hose!  \n\nHumans seem to really like me because I am well-behaved and house-trained.  I\u2019ve met other animals called cats, and they give me a fright, so I won\u2019t be comfortable with them in a house. And I'm pretty picky with other dogs, so it's probably best I get to be the king of my castle by being the only pet.\n\nI am neutered, which means \u201cvery good boy\u201d according to the nice veterinarian I met.  That vet also gave me a microchip, a flu shot, heart-worm test, and all my vaccinations.  \nI have my own harness and leash and I even have 30 days of free health insurance when you adopt me!  I am such a good boy, I convinced them to enter my adoptive family in a $500 gift card drawing, which will buy LOTS of toys for our playtime together. \n\nI am accepting applications for fur-parents now. If you\u2019d like to meet me, drop me a line at adopt@nokill-louisville.com or fill out the adoption form at https://www.nokill-louisville.org/adopt",

This happy-go-lucky pup.  was born with spina bifida which means a portion of his spinal cord is damaged leaving him without the use of his back legs.  This disability doesn't slow Donovan down one bit.  He hops like a little kangaroo all around the back yard in his foster home, \"chasing\" his foster doggy brothers and sisters.  Donovan loves to play fetch and tug-o-war.  He is a very social pup.  Truth be told, Donovan has never met anyone or anything that he doesn't immediately love!  Donovan has a wheelchair that is a little big for him right now but will be just the right size once he is full grown (and will go along with him to whoever adopts him).  As a result of Donovan's disability, he is incontinent. But, a doggy diaper goes a long way towards managing messes.  Donovan is up-to-date on his vaccinations.  If you are interested in meeting this very \"special\" handicapable pup, please contact kathie@herdinghaven.",

            "description": "Georgie is around 5-6 years old and weighs 13 pounds. He has the most adorable curly tail! He was abandoned at the home of a family who is known for taking in unwanted dogs in Colton. They surrendered him to us to find him a forever home. He is quiet and low-maintenance once settled in. He is pretty independent as well. He seems more feline than canine in nature. He has a medium energy level and is not hyper. He does not require a yard, though if he does have a yard or patio, it must be secure for him (no holes or gaps for him to slip out of). He is a timid dog and would do best in a calm home with NO CHILDREN OR VISITORS. He needs an adopter that will understand that Georgie would not do best interacting with people he does not know. He will bark and move away from strangers; he does not want to be pet by strangers. He is sociable and friendly with other small/medium-sized dogs, male or female. He is intimidated by big doggies though and would not be the best match for a household that has a big dog. He would not be suitable for dog parks/beaches due to the higher stress levels and unpredictability of the other dogs or people there. Georgie enjoys the company of humans, but similar to some cats, he does enjoy his independence. He is sweet, though not outwardly affectionate, with his family. Nevertheless, he will require a PATIENT adopter who is willing to let him adjust at his own pace without expecting too much from him too soon. His adopters must be willing to give him space and have patience not to smother him with affection/attention or try to pick him up when he is not ready yet. He would not be a good candidate for inexperienced adopters. He is crate-trained and knows how to use a doggy door. For more information about Georgie, please give his foster mom, Lydia, a call at 714-357-8405. His adoption fee is $225 and covers the cost of his neuter, all core vaccines (Rabies and Distemper/Parvo), microchip and microchip registration. If you\u2019d like to be considered for adoption, the first step is completing an application which is available on our website, poochmatch.com, under the adoption tab. Please read the below paragraphs for more information on our process.\n\nIf this listing is still posted, we are still accepting applications for him/her. We do not do out-of-state adoptions on highly adoptable dogs; we would only consider out-of-state adoptions for dogs that prove hard-to-place locally. We cannot hold dogs, please submit your application when you are ready to adopt.\n\nUPDATE: ADOPTION EVENTS CANCELLED DUE TO PANDEMIC AND SOCIAL DISTANCING. If you are interested in meeting any Poochmatch dog at our weekly adoption event on Saturdays at the Petsmart in Yorba Linda, CA (5521 Mirage St.) between 1-5 PM, please fill out an application from our website, poochmatch.com, and submit it no later than 11 AM on Fridays. Upon receipt AND approval, the dog you are interested in meeting will be made available to meet on a Saturday. Due to the high volume of dogs and puppies in our foster homes, it is impossible to bring them all every Saturday. The only way to ensure that the dog that you are interested in will be at the adoption event is to FILL OUT AN APPLICATION AND BE APPROVED. Otherwise, we cannot guarantee that the dog you are interested in will be at our adoption event. If you cannot make the time frame of our events, appointments can be made at another time and location solely at the discretion of the foster parent. Please understand that private appointments will be coordinated to meet the convenience of the foster parent/transporter. We cannot hold dogs, please submit your application when you are ready to adopt.\n\nAll adoption fees cover the mandatory and non-negotiable spay/neuter, rabies, microchip, microchip registration, full sets of core vaccinations (rabies and 1 set of distemper/parvo for adults, 4 for puppies) and deworming. Adoption fees vary based on age, breed, size and the costs incurred on the dog's behalf by us i.e. medical, behavioral training, etc. and they range from $225-$495.\n\n\nCOVID-19 PROCEDURE:\nIn an effort to create a safe environment for our potential adopters and our staff, we have changed our protocols and procedures during these difficult times. Starting immediately, our procedures will change from what\u2019s written on our website and other social media platforms. Our weekly adoption event at the Petsmart in Yorba Linda is temporarily cancelled due to COVID-19 and social distancing. The only way to meet one of the dogs/puppies we have available for adoption is through completion of our adoption application through our website, poochmatch.com, before 11 AM on Fridays. On Fridays when we review the applications, we will pick the best fit for each dog or puppy applied for and coordinate mutually agreeable appointment times for the applicants who are approved that week. Private appointments are currently only scheduled on Wednesday, Thursday or Saturday of each week. Masks or bandanas are mandatory; faces must be properly covered. \n\nWith the overwhelming desire of the public to adopt at this time, we have received as many as 30 applications for one dog in just one week. Working with a staff of volunteers, we are only able to reach out on Fridays to the people we have approved to adopt. If you have not heard from us by Friday, we have selected a different applicant. If you have multiple dogs/puppies that you are interested in,  please indicate each dog/puppy of interest on the application at that time so we don\u2019t rule you out for another dog/puppy available for adoption.\n\nPlease understand, we have an influx of texts, phone calls and emails that makes it impossible to get to each and every one of you. Not just for adoption interest, but also from veterinarians, people who must relinquish dogs, people who have found a stray dog in need of pick up, etc. We are currently not in need of fosters. Due to the fact that there is such a high demand, we are sticking with strict protocol to not adopt out of Southern California. We apologize for this inconvenience and difficulty to be able to get in touch with us while there is an overwhelming desire and demand to adopt at this time. We appreciate your understanding and patience as we navigate through these difficult times with every intention to keep the public and our staff safe.",

            "description": "Ringo is such a good lookin' guy! He is a tri-color Australian Shepherd, mostly white, with black and brown patches. He is 2 years old (Aug. 2020). He is deaf, but knows some hand signs like sit and down. He is very submissive with people. He is very attentive and loving, and wants to be by someone all the time. He would make a fantastic companion to someone with the time to train him with even more commands.  His deafness is not his biggest problem--he has a very short attention span and doesn't really care about taking the time to learn new things. He can be nippy with other dogs.  He is crate trained and almost house trained.\n\nRingo is looking for a forever family to call his own. His adoption fee is $200, which includes neuter surgery and vaccinations (parvo/distemper and rabies.) If you would like to meet this dog, please email us: scfourpaws@hotmail.com or leave a message @ 435/752-3534. Please be patient with us getting back to you as we are all volunteers with full-time jobs. Thanks for your interest in this wonderful dog!!",

She is a well-mannered, loving, happy, wonderful dog who will make an absolutely AWESOME family pet! Rosey means a lot to all of us at FFFR and we want to see her settled in a wonderful forever home as soon as possible. She is a very special girl.\n\nSince coming back to us in 2018, Rosey has had surgery on both knees - she tore the ACL's in both of them and had a torn meniscus in addition.  She is completely healed from the surgeries and is back to being her happy, active self.\n\nShe also has had a surgery to remove a mass from her foot.  It turned out to be a sarcoma - low grade, of a kind that generally is not metastatic and has a low chance of recurrence.  She should be fine and we don't anticipate any regrowth.\n\nRosey also has skin allergies and is on medication for those.\n\nIn spite of all of that, Rosey has remained a happy, friendly, lovable dog who has withstood long periods of convalescing with good grace.   She is that good a dog and all of us at FFFR love her dearly :)\n\nTo adopt Rosey, please fill out the form at our website -https://www.furryfriendsct.org/adoption-application",

            "description": "My name is Gidget\n\nI arrived at PATCH Rescue November 20, 2018 after spending time in Hesperia Animal Control and being picked up off the mean streets of Hesperia, CA.\n\nI was born approximately November 7, 2012\n\nI am approximately 56 pounds\n\nUnfortunately, we are not seeking a permanent foster for Gidget. Gidget has cancer and it is keep her comfortable until we have to make that HORRIBLE call!\n\nI LOVE to play but NOT by myself, I want you to play with me furever! I will play so long and hard, my toe nails bleed, so be careful to play on soft surface and stop playing with me to let me catch my breath! I am pretty good about potty training, as long as you are diligent. Crate trained, although I LOVE to sit with you, snuggle with you and will sleep just fine in your bed, next to you in a dog bed, etc...I am protective of my person and will bark fiercely at people entering the house. I do pretty well with other big dogs, caution with little dogs. As long as another dog does not challenge me, I am usually just vocal about my displeasure of another dog getting close to my person or food. Will you provide the furever home, I so richly deserve?!\n\nAdoption fee includes: fixed, up to date on core vaccines (5 in 1, bordetella & rabies), dewormed, microchipped, growth tested & removed from paw and any health issues we were aware of addressed.\n\nIf Interested PLEASE contact PATCH Rescue Inc. patchrescue@gmail.com or (760) 706-0728\n\nAdopt a Pet Listings =\n\nhttps://www.adoptapet.com/adoption_rescue/93645-patch-rescue-inc-victorville-california\n\nPetFinder Listings =\n\nhttps://www.petfinder.com/member/us/ca/victorville/patch-rescue-inc-ca2487/\n\nAdoption process is verbal interview to determine if we think your family is the right situation for the fur kid you are interested in, application (can be downloaded here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B9ZDmKaRLnYfbDZLbDN5Y3hYeWM?usp=sharing), once application is reviewed and approved home check. Then we say you are becoming part of the PATCH family adopting one of our fur kids, so we expect follow up on our family member throughout their life!\n\nPlease keep in mind we are 100% volunteer run We do not have a facility, completely foster based, so we all have our real jobs, it could take 24 to 48 hours to receive a response.\n\nThank you for considering adoption to save two lives!",

            "description": "Nina is an active 2yo 45lb border collie/german shepherd mix. She has a lot of personality and can be a total derp (tongue hanging out sideways and everything)! She's housebroken and crate trained, and walks amazing on the leash! She loves other dogs and is good with indoor cats. She is pretty high energy and enjoys going on hikes and playing with her canine siblings. She MUST go to a home where there is a resident confident adult medium-large dog (she worships the male german shepherd in her foster home but is best friends with a female Doberman the same age.. she's fine with small dogs but she's a bit too rambunctious for them). She has also discovered the comforts of the couch and loves to lay along the top and get petted while you watch movies. Because she can still be skittish with people though, she should NOT go to a home with children or apartment living (no exceptions!). She would do best in a gentle, quiet adult only home with another dog and a house with fenced yard. She has gained a lot of skills and confidence while in her foster home, but she is ready for the next chapter in her life with a new family that will continue to help her grow.\n\nHere is Nina's story video: https://youtu.be/KxWGwurZVWk\n\nKing is Nina's companion/emotional support dog. He's a 7-8yo purebred 75lb German Shepherd. Nina WORSHIPS him and is his shadow, follows him everywhere, and they even crate together. King is a mellow boy who prefers lounging in the house or on the couch. He would do best in a cat-free home.\n\nThey are not for first time dog owner, but when together they're pretty easy. All they need is a couch and a yard.\n\nAdoption fee for the two together will be $550.\n\nNina can also be adopted by herself without King, however, we are requiring she go to a home that has another resident dog, and that she goes with a pal pup (either King or another known friend) for the first week during the transition phase, so that she doesn't panic in a new home.\nPlease contact Diana at (510) 333-4420 or theperfectdogrescue@gmail.com or fill out the adoption application:\nhttp://www.theperfectdog.org/TPDadoptapp.doc",

We think, that he was kept on a mechanics lot and never loved. Charlie is cautious of new people and needs a gradual introduction. He's currently receiving obedience training and learning to trust. Once he's comfortable, he shows his silly and playful side. He loves toys and he's super smart. He knows how to get food out of puzzle toys and enjoys lounging in the grass or on soft blankets. Charlie will need a calm, adult household (max. 2 people) with yard access.\nContact\nIngrid\n(310) 480 6030\npcdrapps@yahoo.com\nIf you would like to meet this cutie, please complete the adoption application:\nhttp://www.pcdogrescue.org/about-us/application.html",

He was rescued on his last day before being euthanized at a public shelter and he had a hard life. We think, that he was kept on a mechanics lot and never loved. Charlie is cautious of new people and needs a gradual introduction. He's currently receiving obedience training and learning to trust. Once he's comfortable, he shows his silly and playful side. He loves toys and he's super smart. He knows how to get food out of puzzle toys and enjoys lounging in the grass or on soft blankets. Charlie will need a calm, adult household (max. 2 people) with yard access.\nContact\nIngrid\n(310) 480 6030\npcdrapps@yahoo.com",

            "description": "Brooklyn is looking for a true fairytale ending! She was a very loved puppy until her owner passed away when she was about 6-7 months old. His vet kindly took her in and hoped to find her a home quickly. Unfortunately being in the kennel environment was stressful for her and she became nervous around strangers. The vet hospital decided it may be too risky to adopt her out considering her breed and how fearful she was of someone who had come to meet her. \n\nFor nine years she lived in the vet hospital because there was nowhere else for her to go. The staff there loved her, but it was not a home. When she turned 10 they asked us if we would consider accepting her into our rescue to live the rest of her life here with us. We agreed, and expected her to be aggressive or anxious. The dog we met, however, was none of the above. \n\nIt seems Brooklyn spent almost a decade of her life in a kennel run because she was misunderstood. She is not an aggressive dog, she is a nervous dog. Anyone who meets her and lets her approach them at her own pace will have a loyal and honest friend for life. She never forgets her people, and she loves them fiercely. Brooklyn also loves other dogs and is happy to coexist or even run around with the youngsters. You'd be surprised at how fast this old lady can run when she gets going! \n\nWhat Brooklyn needs is a loving and understanding home who will get to know her slowly and not push her to get to know strangers too quickly once she is home. She also needs a patient home, as she has spent almost all of her life in a kennel run, never being properly housebroken. She has made some progress with this, but it will definitely be a process to completely housebreak her in a home environment. \n\nBrooklyn needs someone willing to give her the time to get used to them and warm up to them before they ask anything of her. She's spent a lot of her life being scared and she's still extremely wary of strangers.\n\nWe know this is a lot to ask of an adopter especially considering how difficult it can be to find adopters for senior bully breeds, but she is worth it. If she stays with us for life, that is absolutely fine, but we want to give her the shot to have a loving, and forever home with a family for the first time in her life.",

She is full of energy and walks well on a leash. She loves attention and wants to be someone's main girl. She does ok with most dogs with a very slow introduction but really prefers all the attention for herself, as she has been a little dog selective at times. She has not been around cats so unsure of what reaction she would have. She's been great with all the kids she's been around and just absolutely thrives on attention. Poppy loves to give hugs. She's been outside but she crates well and could easily learn about house training as she is a very smart girl that loves to please. Poppy is spayed, microchipped and up to date on all her shots. This beautiful girl has waited a long time for a loving home and is so ready. For more information on Poppy and adoption details please contact Rhonda at vzcountyhs@gmail.com 1/14/21 9:47 PM",

He also like peanut butter, fetch, car rides, and smelling feet. He knows the sit, stay, come, no, down, and off commands. If he doesn't see you, he'll bark at the door until you let him out. He weighs 13 pounds and is moderately active. He enjoys tugging, toys, and going for walksespecially if there are some feet somewhere to smell! He's a suburb watch dog and very protective of his home inside and out and his human. No one will ever sneak up on you because he will bark until they leave, even a dog much, much bigger than he is. He has no fears. He's very possessive of his food and his things. Even though he is friendly with other dogs and children outside the home, if they are inside it is a different story: he has to protect his 'stuff' and no dog or kid had better come near him. Older kids may be ok as long as they respect what's his. He totally won't tolerate living with a cat or a bird. It just needs to be you and him and he wants to be where you are. He can be a bit of a loner but a more loyal companion you'll never find.Russo would do best as an only pet in a home with no children. If you are looking for a loyal best friend who would watch over you and your property, please fill out an adoption application for him. He's a good boy a bit set in his ways who deserves a good home!",

I see all strangers as a potential threat and it takes me quite some time to accept new people into my world. However, once I do I love to spend time with you and have my belly rubbed. I love car rides and will just sleep in the back seat or sit nicely looking out of the window. I don't want to share my food and would prefer you leave me alone while eating. I'm looking for an adopter who understands the need to gain my trust and is willing to visit and wait until the time is right to take me home.\nBrittany is estimated to be approximately 8 years old and weighs around 50 lbs.

As is the case with any showgirl, Lola wants to be front and center with all the attention on her so she is lookig for a home where she can be an only pet.

I enjoy chew toys and toys that require me to think like puzzles. I do require a special diet to help prevent me from having so many UTIs.

His foster mom took him to the Emergency Clinic today and he was found to have anemia, infection of unknown origin and elevated liver enzymes. Also elevated bile acids. He is being referred to Internal Med Specialist for ultrasound of his liver. We will update as we know more.\n\n6/7/19 - Hi, my name is Cash and I'm from Texas.  Yep,  a Texas sized Yorkie with a Texas sized bark.  Still a lover though.  You kind of have to hear my bark to believe it is coming out of this little body.  I think someone mixed a little raspy doberman in my vocal cords.  So, don't expect any cute Tinkerbell tunes to be coming out of this body.  Speaking of my body, since I'm getting a little up in age, I was having some trouble at night when I was sleeping with wetting myself.  It was so embarrassing and all the other dogs would just get up and move away from me.  I talked to foster mom about it and she and the vet started me on something called Proin and now I wake as dry as the Sahara Desert.  Whew!  No more getting made fun of.   \n\n2/10/19 - Hi, my name is Cash and I'm from Texas.  Yep,  a Texas sized Yorkie with a Texas sized bark.  Still a lover though.  You kind of have to hear my bark to believe it is coming out of this little body.  I think someone mixed a little raspy doberman in my vocal cords.  So, don't expect any cute Tinkerbell tunes to be coming out of this body.  Speaking of my body, since I'm getting a little up in age, I was having some trouble at night when I was sleeping with wetting myself.  It was so embarrassing and all the other dogs would just get up and move away from me.  I talked to foster mom about it and she and the vet started me on something called Proin and now I wake as dry as the Sahara Desert.  Whew!  No more getting made fun of.  Oh, one other thing the vet and foster mom talked about was that I seemed to be blinking alot and the vet said that I have dry eye.  Guess that Proin REALLY WORKS!  lol  No, it doesn't really affect the eyes, but I do have to let foster mom put some drops in my eyes (Cyclosporin drops)  daily to help with the dryness.  So, if you give me my daily pill, I will stay dry on one end during the night and give me my daily eye drops, I will stay moist on the other end and then I am one happy Yorkie/Raspy Doberman mix.  \n\n12/16/18 - Cash is a \"diamond in the ruff\".  When he was originally picked up, he was covered in fleas and his hair was terribly matted.  He was shaved down and had pretty rough looking skin.  His skin has improved and he is looking to much better. Just wait until his hair grows back in!  :)\n\nCash had his surgery to remove the bladder stones on 11.27.18 and has recovered well from that surgery.  He is now on a prescription diet to hopefully prevent further stone formation.  We are still waiting on the report on the type of bladder stones. He had a bladder infection that was cleared with antibiotics.  He is having some issues with occasional nighttime incontinence so we are working to figure out the cause of that.  He wears a belly band and does not seem bothered by it at all.  \n\nCash is a very pleasant pup who gets along well with his foster siblings.  He loves to snuggle in bed at night with his foster mom and other pups. \n\n11/26/2018 - Cash was given away online to a lady who ended up taking him to a vet only to find out that she could not afford him due to all of his presenting medical needs. She reached out to us since he needed immediate surgery. He also has flea dermatitis and dry eye. She told us he was covered with fleas when she got him. She treated him for the fleas and did get some meds for him and also medicated shampoo for his horribly irritated skin. \n\nHe is presently at our vet being prepped for surgery. As we know more about Cash we will update his bio.\n\n",

They lived in an abandoned trailer in Bridgeport. Their owner will never be able to return home and this is his last wish to make sure his dogs are safe and loved for the remainder of their lives. At one point they were inside/outside dogs however since their owners health started to decline they had been \"on their own\" so to speak and were able to go in and out of a mobile home. We trapped all 3 and Sammie, who was the most feral was the first to trap. Sammie is now 100% inside house dog adjusted. He is house trained, crate trained, knows some commands and is just living his best life. Sammie actually played a crucial role in the rescue of both his brother Bear, (who has been adopted), and his sister Buster who is still looking for a perfect home. Sammie is a sweet boy who is looking for a home, with his sister Buster. \n\nSammie is bonded (healthy bond) with his more shy sister Buster and she really follows his lead. We would love them to find a foster or FURever home of their own, hopefully with less dogs than their current foster. The home needs to be ok being patient and showing them the love they need to continue to progress towards their potential awesomeness! Sammie and Buster are good with other dogs and cats, however both do better with other more submissive and or independent canine housemates.\n\nThis pair is truly beyond deserving and so amazing. After losing their human, being left to basically fend for themselves, being trapped, being mostly rehabbed and now living in a foster with so many other dogs. This dynamic duo deserves a fantastic home to live out the rest of their time on this planet. \n\nBONDED WITH SAMMIE, MUST GO TOGETHER\n\nDue to having them so long in rescue and truly wanting to find them the most amazing home we have lowered their fee, as long as they are adopted together.\n\n $200.00 Adoption Fee \n\n(Which is considered a non refundable donation and being we are a 501c3 organization it is tax deductible. The fee itself is not negotiable, our vets don't negotiate and thus neither do we.)\n\nIf you think Buster and Sammie may be a good fit for your household and you're interested in helping please contact us!!! \n\nTo Contact Us\n\nMessage us through our website http://www.highplainspaw.org\n\nMessage the Facebook Page at https://www.facebook.com/HighPlainsPAW\n\nFill out our Adoption Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/adoption-application\n\nFill out our Foster Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/foster-application\n\nEmail us at highplainspaw@gmail.com\n\nCall our VOICEMAIL at (402)957-1578\n\nWE DO NOT HAVE A FACILITY ALL OUR DOGS ARE LOCATED IN FOSTER HOMES. This means there is no place for you to go in person to view our dogs. We ask that an application be filled out and we will go from there!",

While that's totally accurate, some of you might have heard about me from national newspapers. I don't want to get into it too much since my life is night and day different from what it had been, but I'd been beaten pretty badly and abandoned in the woods. I was saved by a kind person, and made my way to Mackenzie's. \n\nThanks to tons of love and support from so many generous, kind, and patient people, I've healed quite a bit and made great strides...and I think I'm ready to find my \"forever home.\" At Mackenzie's, I've grown to love the staff and volunteers, and I'm spoiled with long walks, play time in the big yard... In the summer, I love to splash around in the water! I'll even play a little fetch sometimes. I have a signature wiggle that is known around the grounds - it makes its appearance when I see one of my favorite people! \n\nBecause of my past, I really would be happiest as the only pet in a quiet home with love and cuddles galore. I've come such a long way, and can't wait to share all that I've learned and all my love with the right person. \n\nBirthday: 01-09-2010\n\nMeet-Your-Match Canineality Color is: Orange Goofball! \n\nMackenzie's Animal Sanctuary is the Midwest's largest no-kill dog sanctuary. As such, Mackenzie's is 'a home along the way,' providing our dogs with excellent and individualized care in all areas (medical and otherwise) and tending to whatever special needs a dog may have. Some of our dogs have special behavioral needs (like fear issues) and will need to build a relationship with the adopter before going to their forever home. \nFor safety's sake, we are looking for homes with physical fenced-in areas. \nPlease fill out our online adoption survey at www.mackenzies.info",

She likes to play by herself but wants her humans to cuddle her and give her lots of love. She is an escape artist so she would need a very secure yard or be supervised while outside. She will need a home that will get her into a routine so she can calm down. \nACTIVITY LEVEL\nMedium-high\nMEDICAL NEEDS\nShe has some anxiety which can be controlled with regular exercise. She broke her leg but she is all healed up and it is not causing any problems\nKIDS\nOlder children    \nOTHER PETS \nShe has to be the only dog  \nEXERCISE NEEDS\nYard needed  \nHOUSEBROKEN\nShe hasn\u2019t been in a home environment in a long time but with a routine she will get the hang of it.\n DISLIKES: Afraid of loud noises like fireworks and thunder.\n",

She was petrified at the shelter, then, bounced around on a two-day transport from TX-NY with lots of other dogs. But she adjusted to her new foster home so quickly, and bonded with the foster mom's young grandchildren, and her two sweet pits, who play with Bonnie in the yard. Her wonderful foster mom, knows how much Bonnie loves to run, so she takes her to a park, to run and play. She is excellent off-leash, coming back when she is called. She is also a real love bug and loves to snuggle. Bonnie is about a year and three months old, weighs about 27 lbs, has all her shots, is spayed, microchipped, heartworm negative, and is on flea & tick/HW prevention. She is about as perfect as one dog can be. If you are interested in Bonnie, please call Sindee. 914-299-3700.",

            "description": "Zoey came to us back in November of 2017 with her pups. They have long since been adopted, but Zoey has had difficulty finding a family.  Luckily, we have been able to learn about her personality and needs through various temporary foster homes which has proven very valuable and we feel that, with the knowledge we now have, we can truly help Zoey and her family find each other.  \n\nHere\u2019s what we know about Zoey:  She is an approximately 4 year old PitBull Terrier weighing around 50 pounds.  She does well with other dogs on her terms. She prefers a home where she can have her own area to \u201cget away to\u201d be left alone when things get too overwhelming (too loud, too many people, etc).  So a home without too much going on might be best for her. \n\nShe does well with kids, but because she sometimes wants to be alone, we feel like living in a home with kids might overwhelm her, therefore we do not wish to place her in a home with children.  \n\nZoey will need an experienced dog owner, preferably someone with Pitbull or other stubborn breed experience.  She can be an absolute joy to be around, however she has a stubborn streak in her.\n\nWe feel that she would love to go on hikes and explore new places with her family.  Or maybe a nice leash walk followed by snuggles on the couch?  Maybe even some swimming or a nice car ride?  Zoey loves doing it all!  \n\nIf you think you might be the family Zoey needs, fill out an adoption application at the link below.\nhttps://forms.gle/gw9k5r2ArJwJyVm87\n  Feel free to message us with questions regarding Zoey.  \n\nZoey doesn\u2019t understand why her family hasn\u2019t come for her yet and why she never gets \u201cchosen\u201d.  Please help us give Zoey the happiness she deserves by finding her perfect family that we know is out there somewhere. She is currently been here the longest of any animal in the rescue",

He rallied his fellow neighbors and they took up a collection to get him to a vet to evaluate his condition.  He was diagnosed with advanced heartworm disease infection, his belly was swollen due to fluid build up from the strain on his heart and his condition was critical.  The good news was, his blood work was really good.  So, the vet felt there was a good chance he could survive this.  He was put on Vetmedin (a medication to help lessen the stress on his heart).   Once the fluid reduced we saw how severely malnourished and thin he was. We have fattened him up & his heart condition has improved tremendously and is now off of his heart medication!  His heartworm status is now moderately positive.  He was recently cleared to be neutered and came through the surgery like a star!  Brad Pit is such a sweet and happy guy.  You can see in his eyes this boy has a will to live! The next step is heartworm treatment to completely rid him of those nasty heartworms, but we would love to find a quiet foster home for him while he undergoes heartworm treatment.  Please contact us if you are interested in fostering this guy for a couple of months.  He's so wonderful, you might just end up keeping him!  Thank you!",

He would do better with older kids or kids that know how to respecte a dog. \nWe  have been told he gets along with cats, but there are no cats in the foster home to test him.\n\nHe loves to sleep with you. He will actually warm up the bed for you by doing the Eskie dance to make sure the blankets and sheets are all nice and fluff for you. He loves to throw the pillows off the couch and onto the floor. He is one fun loving Eskie. He is about 19lbs. He has separation anxiety and will bark when you leave the house. So no apartment life for him. He loves to run and take walks.  He enjoys barking at the squirrels and birds in the trees. He is a nature lover.\n\nHe is fostered near Cincinnati, OH",

            "description": "Gretel is a three old female Chihuahua/Dachshund mix who weighs about 20lbs. She is up to date on vaccines and spayed. Gretel is crate trained, but still working on house training. She is good with other dogs, she does have a prey drive so we wouldn't put her in a home with birds or pet rodents.\n\nGretel is very shy around humans and takes quite a while to trust humans. She needs a family that understands that it could take months for her to trust them enough to even approach them voluntarily and is willing to give her that time. Gretel has never shown a hint of aggression, but would be overwhelmed by children. Because it will take some time for her to trust someone enough to let them leash her, Gretel needs to be in a home with a fence and would not do well in an apartment setting.\n\nBefore applying for Gretel, please carefully consider if you are willing to have the patience it will take for Gretel to be comfortable and put in the work. We are not exaggerating - expect it to take MONTHS for her to trust you. She will spend most of that time hiding under the furniture. When Gretel does decide to trust, she is very sweet and cuddly with her person. However, this a dog that will always hide when you have visitors. She will likely never come out of her shell enough to enjoy the dog park, breweries or anything that requires being around strange people. Gretel needs someone who understands her limits and is willing to love her as she is. Gretel is going to be work, but she's worth the effort.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Gretel please submit an inquiry directly with Greater Charlotte SPCA by visiting charlottespca.org/adopt.\n\n***Because our rescue is composed entirely of volunteers and we require a home check for each of our adoptable pets prior to them going to their new homes, local applications will take precedence. We will accept out of town applications, but any family further than 60 miles from Charlotte is responsible for finding a representative of a rescue local to them that is willing to perform the home check. All out of town applicants will also have to be willing to drive to Charlotte to meet/pick up the pet as soon as the application is approved.***",

            "description": "Meet Oscar \nThis boy has our hearts and they\u2019re breaking in pieces that he has yet to find his forever loving home.  After two false starts and much abuse and neglect, Oscar is safe and loved with us. But a shelter is no place to live out your life. Especially when you are has wonderful and friendly a boy as Oscar. Every day Oscar hopes that today will be the day. He LOVES people and he so wants to be that special boy in someone\u2019s life. \nOscar is nearly seven now. Between his breed, he\u2019s an American bull terrier mix, and his age, no one has been willing to give him a chance. But they should. He is something special and we\u2019re not just saying that. Oscar LOVES with his whole heart. He absolutely adores people and children. He\u2019s trained, he\u2019s calm, he\u2019s gentle, he\u2019s affectionate, he\u2019s goofy and he\u2019s incredibly loyal. Oscar welcomes a good back scratch and wags his whole body when he sees his people. He\u2019s the kind of boy that you\u2019ll want to while away the day with on the couch or porch or going for a drive. Oscar loves going for drives. He loves walking and makes strolling easy to do. He\u2019s exceptionally companionable. \nOscar has been given a special bed in his kennel, with his very own pillow made just for him. He loves his bed and can often be found on it, quietly chewing a bone or snoozing his day away. He has touched many hearts and has a guardian who sends him monthly care packages.  While on one hand we\u2019re glad to see he\u2019s seemingly content, on the other we wish he would be doing this in someone\u2019s home and brightening their day. \nDespite Oscar\u2019s past, Oscar has a heart of gold when it comes to people.  He LOVES people and is kind and gentle with children.  Oscar has had a tough past with other dogs and needs to be an only dog. He doesn\u2019t like cats, squirrels or deer and will give chase. He\u2019s incredibly smart and knows basic commands. He loves the water and enjoys bathing in his kiddie pool. His tail is always wagging and he gives those he loves big sloppy kisses. The family or person able and willing to open their heart and home to Oscar will be richly rewarded with one incredible dog. We hope that special someone will come for Oscar so he can make his/her day that much brighter. \nIf interested in Oscar, please submit an application online at: https://www.charlessmithgallhumanesociety.org/page/dog-adoption-application \nOnce an application is submitted online, you will receive an email saying your application has been successfully submitted.

I was taken in at a shelter where they cleaned me up and neutered me.  I don't remember when I was born - I may be around 6 years old but sometimes I play like I'm still a pup.  \n\nAlthough my color is more golden, my personality is all Pyr.  I display the true guarding ability of the Pyr.  Since I have no livestock to guard, I feel responsible to guard my family.   I am very loving with my family and will be very protective.  Because of my guarding, I'd prefer go with someone that is very familiar with Pyrs and no children.  \n\nCheck out my professional photo...aren't I handsome?  I know how to sit and give a paw or two.  My favorite things?  I love to give kisses and curl up on my doggie bed.  I am treat driven and want to please. \n\nOnce I meet a person, I begin to like them.  My foster mom and I worked hard on interactions with other dogs...so I'm doing fine with most dogs and have to admit that I like the females much better!  We haven't encountered cats yet, so we do not know about felines.\n\nAll Great Pyrenees require a fenced-in yard (at least four foot high). If you have questions about the breed or our adoption policies and procedures, please go to our website at www.agprescue.org. There's plenty of good information about the breed on our website - Pyrs aren't a breed for everyone! \n\nOur adoption application is online: http://agprescue.org/adoption-application/agpr-application-donations/\n\nPlease note that we are a small regional rescue organization. We will consider adopting to families within a four to five hour drive to Richmond, VA",

A very special girl, that need a very special person to adopt her.  Her preference is a woman-led home. She loves air conditioning, and comfy beds.  Also likes to defluff toys and play with them!\n\nShe is a smart girl, who can be stubborn when she wants to sleep in during the mornings (haha).  She has been in rescue the past three (3) years of her life.  She takes quite some time to warm up to new people, and does not show well in a kennel/cage (has cage aggression with strangers).  She would like to be able to be an inside/outside dog, as she enjoys doing both (especially the cool air!).  YOU MUST HAVE A FENCED IN YARD!\n\nWillow cannot be placed in a home with other dogs or cats, as she is aggressive and will attack WITHOUT being provoked.  A securely fenced in yard is a must, but 4-foot fencing is just fine.  She knows basic commands, crate trained, and house trained.  She was adopted originally from rescue as a puppy, but eventually became too aggressive with the other dogs in her home to live there safely.  When given a chance, she loves to run around the back yard and roll down the hill!  She likes short walks in familiar quiet parks, but doesn't want to meet new people or dogs, thank you.\n\nShe has skin allergies that can become severe in the summer, and needs regular vet visits to manage this with Bravecto and ear meds, etc.  Also requires grain free food. If you can commit to giving her the loving home she deserves, she promises to love you forever. It will take several meetings to adjust to new people, so potential adopters need to live in the Cleveland/Chattanooga/Knoxville area.  Thank you!\n\nNOTES:\n\nOur adoption fees include spay/neuter, microchip, set of three (3) DHPP vaccines (puppies under 4 months only), bordatella (kennel cough) vaccine, rabies vaccine (over 3 months old),  heartworm test (6 months or older), deworming, and up to date flea/tick/heartworm prevention.  \n\nThis dog/puppy is in foster care in Cleveland, TN. Our standard adoption fee is $150 unless otherwise noted, which includes all vetting.  Application, vet references, personal references, and home visits may be required prior to adoption. \n\nPlease email us at pawsofvalor.ar@gmail.com to ask questions or ask for an adoption application.\n",

            "description": "Name: Noel\nBreed: American Pitbull Terrier\nAge: Approx. 7-8 years old (as of Oct 2020)\nSex: Female\nGood with Dogs: No \nGood with Cats: No\nGood with Kids: Yes\n\nNoel is a wonderful, squishy lovebug that loves to romp and play. She's a semi-active little gal that beams happiness from her head to her tail when she is around people! She absolutely loves treats and would eat until she pops. Noel is a true delight to be around. She lives for smooches and bellyrubs in particular. Noel is playful, gentle with people, and would make the greatest best friend!\n\nNoel came to us after having been discarded like so much trash after what we can only assume was a failed backyard breeding run. Noel was \"used\" and dumped off, where a good Samaritan asked for our assistance in getting her well and finding her a loving home. Noel is a treasure of a velvet hippo that you just come away wanting more!\n\n\n\n----\nPeach County Animal Rescue is a rescue located in Fort Valley, GA. Our adoption fees range from $250-350+. Although our rescue dogs share a common bond with one another, no rescue story is the same (even when similar). Vetting costs vary depending on their health conditions. For us, it is never about the money. We are a non-profit. Thank you for your love and support! All of our dogs are fully vetted: up-to-date on annual shots, spayed/neutered and microchipped with a lifetime registration. We look forward to hearing from you!\n\nIf you would like to send in an application for this dog, please use the link below! https://peachcountyanimalrescueandrehabilitation.org/apply-now-2/",

            "description": "Jesse was found as a stray in Darlington. He was picked at the intersection of N Main St and Doneraile St.  He has been in foster with Debbie A and she has been trying to help him gain weight. Many of his teeth are broken. He has badly clipped ears and a lot of hair loss. Despite this, he is very affectionate and sweet.  HW+; 45lbs; 2-3 yrs old; bull mix; 11/19/18\n\nFoster update May 28:   I picked him up from out of the road, dodging traffic, on Halloween night.  He was in terrible shape when I found him.  He had a collar on but was so emaciated, his skin was red and irritated and he was so dirty.  We began working to put some weight back on him and work on his skin issues.  He still has a little hair loss on his back, but he is doing much better.  He is an older guy and you can tell that humans have not been kind to him in his life.  Despite all that, he is the sweetest and most loving little man.  I had his intake done at the shelter and brought him straight home with me into foster, so he's not spent any time at the shelter.  Great dog so deserving of a home of his own!\n",

            "description": "Caroline came to us as a transfer from  another shelter a little over a year ago,   This little lady lives life large!  Probably a mix of pit bull, perhaps pug, and who knows what else, Caroline has been described as a cross between a pit bull and a stick of dynamite.   She has that much enthusiasm for everything she does!  Caroline needs to be challenged, stimulated and guided by a firm but loving owner.  When she first arrived, Caroline had no tolerance for other dogs, but has learned to accept that they can have a place on her planet when she's out and about, but never, never sharing the same home. \nOn the other hand, she is incredibly social with the two legged sort, often assuming the role of Mayor, greeting everyone she meets when walking throughout the nearby village.  She just loves a  party or just good conversation and is always happy to take center stage.  \nCaroline has a great sense of adventure and has a positive can do attitude! Just check out the pictures from our walks - trying out a skate board, a swing, a toy car, you name it - she'll try it!  And, it's always her idea! If something has wheels and a motor - even better!  In fact, the bigger the better! The UPS truck  was great, the heavy equipment in the parking lot was a blast, but a plain ol' car will do just fine, as long as it transports her for a new adventure! \nCaroline is not a dog for a first time dog owner, but for an experienced person who loves a dog with a strong personality, a sense of humor and a sense of adventure.  If this little pumpkin isn't well understood or challenged, she'll come up with other things to amuse her, which, you probably wouldn't find nearly as funny as she does.  For the right person, Caroline promises to be one of the most entertaining, lovable and engaging dogs you'll ever share your home with. \nThis little pumpkin is between 2 - 3 years old and weighs in at just about 37 pounds (of solid muscle). \n\nAdoption Fee: $175  (dogs over 1 year) or $225 (dogs under 1 year) includes spay/neuter rabies, DHLPP and kennel cough vaccinations, worming, flea treatment, heartworm testing, heartworm preventative, microchipping and microchip registration fee. \n\nPlease call us at 607-594-2255 ext. 201 to schedule an appointment to meet her. Adoption application and details on adopting can be found on our website here: http://schuylerhumane.org",

I'm still young so I need daily structured exercise and discipline. I know \"sit\" but need to learn more commands and still need help with leash training; but nothing that the proper leash/collar tools like a \"gentle leader\" harness won't fix. I'm currently living with other large dogs but I'm only good with the dogs I know and because I've not been socialized with other outside dogs,  I'm \"socially ackward\" and bark/lunge at other dogs (especially small dogs) &  would need an experienced handler to introduce me properly so it's preferred that I be a SOLO DOG. Also I'm not fond of cats so NO CATS for me. I've not been around young kids either so older kids ages 10 yrs+ would be best! I'm a sweet blue-eyed beauty and need someone who knows, appreciates and understands my breed! I will be your BFF.. come meet/adopt me today!\n\nFor application - Pls email: INFO@TAILSOFLOVERESCUE.ORG",

I am a darling girl who is friendly .. but I am very shy & submissive. I am not sure about other dogs bc I've never met any other dogs except for the ones I live with & have not been socialized with outside dogs.  Because I'm so timid, it's best I go with older kids ages 10 yrs+ that know how to respect a dog's space and can be gentle with me. It's best If I go as a SOLO DOG or with folks that have EXPERIENCE introducing unsocialized/scaredy dogs to other dogs. I need folks that are willing to put in the time to work with me to give me the confidence I need to be a more secure/confident dog. I'm still a young girl so I need daily structured exercise and further leash training. I am a \"diamond in the ruff\" and will be a \"GEM OF A DOG\" in the right environment. If you've got the patience & compassion ...  Please come meet/adopt me today!\n\nFor more info/application - pls email: INFO@TAILSOFLOVERESCUE.ORG",

Shelby is great with other dogs and people although with people she has to start off slow, she want to make sure those around her are good and are not going to hurt her but love her.\n \nShelby was living in a home for a moment but then they let her go and was rescued by a fellow rescuer. After some searching they reached out to us and we took her in. Shelby spent over a year in our hands learning and observing the world with new eyes. She is afraid of new things but learns fast and loves hard.\n\nWe hold an event every weekend at our facility on SATURDAY 11-5pm.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Please visit our social media platforms for the specifics for each weekend as it changes from week to week. Please find our application at lovejoyfoundation.org when you come to an event please bring that filled out in hand with you. You can find our application at Lovejoyfoundation.orgYou MUST submit an APPLICATION via email in hopes to get an appointment, our application is found on our website lovejoyfoundation.org. If you do not get a phone call by Friday then we did not have anything available for you or the pet of interest was adopted before we got you application. We are a Southern California based rescue and do nothing adopt further than an hour from our headquarters in Inglewood, Ca. we do not adopt out more than a 30 minute radius. We appreciate you being understanding and Patient as we attempt to go back to a new normal.",

PLEASE CONTACT WHO SAVED WHO RESCUE IF INTERESTED. \nhttps://wswrescue.com/\nhttps://wswrescue.com/contact-us\n(602) 446-2298\n\n\nAmazing, one-eyed, dopey, potential FAMILY dog comes with 3 training sessions to ensure entire family is happy ? Buddy will fit into almost any home from kids to elderly.\n\nKIDS: YES, please!\nCATS: definitely no. ???

Very easy dog take care of.\nOTHER: House trained ? crate trained ?? leash trained (loose leash walker) ?????????\nENJOYS: butt scratches and sniffing around the yard \nAGE: ~6 years\n\nAre you interested in meeting Buddy or have questions? Please contact \n\nThis pup was at MCACC and had a rough go of it. He was adopted and returned. This AARMy of dog lovers and givers stepped in to help with the money needed for eye surgery bill and training. YOU all saved his life! ??\n\nBUDDY has shown his happy-go-lucky spirit since his left eye removal. His trainers at Paw Creek Training saw a HUGE shift in personality once he wasn't in pain from that eye. They have worked with him every day for the last 2 months while he recovered.\n\n???? He loves to please and shower love on his humans. He knows many commands including place (like 'stay'), come, sit, no, etc. The trainers, Amanda and Brian, will teach you what he knows before taking him home, and they will make sure you're comfortable by offering 2 free follow up trainings in your home.\n\nHe sits and/or sleeps calmly in his kennel. He likes having his own space to relax in.\n\n??? Buddy doesn't understand what toys are for yet. His new family gets the joy of potentially seeing him discover how FUN they are ?\n\nThis dog is ready to go for a hike or watch some Netflix. He is really an easy going, simple pup who just needs to love and feel secure. Are you ready?",

            "description": "Morrisey\n\nLocated in Dalton NE\n\n5ish years old \n\nCatahoula mix\n\nReally would do best as an only animal\n\nNo idea on cats but to error on the side of caution we would say no\n\nHas been good with children but also had an incident with a child \n\nHouse trained \n\nDoesn't love a crate but will crate, he also knows all basic commands\n\nFully vetted \n\n45lbs \n\nThis is Morrisey and he was actually adopted 1.5 years ago ago. He was so loved and cherished in this home. He was an only dog, had grand children to play with and really we THOUGHT he was in the most amazing home. Until it wasn't. One evening a situation occured between Morrisey and one of the grand children which truly wasn't Morrisey's fault. Morrisey can be high anxiety and he was trigger stacked. The adopters at the time ignored all his VERY CLEAR communications that he was uncomfortable. We had really hoped that the adopters would have even tried to work through the issue but it became apparent they never had any intention on doing so. After they abandoned their dog in the impound vet (without any of his belongings including his BED) and surrendered their ownerhip to HPPAW they went out 3 days later, while Morrisey was still sitting sad, scared, confused and alone and bought a new puppy, and wanted to reuse the bed. It was truly heartbreaking. \n\nWhen we recieved this lug back he was moribly obese and a shell of the dog we adopted out and our hearts were immediately broke into a thousand pieces. He went back to his original foster and while he was happy to see her, she owns several dogs and also has several fosters so this amazing guy is growing more and more defeated by the day. He went from being a cherished only dog with devoted people to living in a home where he gets far less attention and is very limited to where in the house he can be when, so we understand his sadness, goodness we are sad too. No matter he still has the best little wiggling booty around and is seriously an incredibly sweet soul. Over the past 1.5 years he has lost weight and is at an appropriate weight. He has again learned to love rides in the car, he's learned how to trust people again and he REALLY needs a home, temporary or permanent ASAP.\n\nWe would really love to find a home for him where he is an only dog, he has previously lived in a foster with multiple other dogs but it's an incredibly experienced foster who did super slow introductions. While he has actually spent time daily with children for months, due to the 1 incident, which wasn't his fault, we are looking for a home with limited children. We want him to go to a home thats excited to work with him as he's super eager to please. He will try to push his luck and get away with things so someone who is willing to lovingly correct him and understands we give dogs boundaries BECAUSE we love them would be awesome. We really want somewhere that he will be protected and loved. Where he can relax and feel safe. He does love people and truly LOVES rides in the pick up so he may be a great companion for a trucker looking for a canine partner for adventures! \n\nIf you think that Morrisey may be a match for you please contact us ASAP! \n\nMorrisey has been waiting such a long time and really deserves a foster with less dogs or a fantastic FURever home!\n\n $200.00 Adoption Fee \n\n(Which is considered a non refundable donation and being we are a 501c3 organization it is tax deductible. The fee itself is not negotiable, our vets don't negotiate and thus neither do we.)\n\nTo Contact Us\n\nMessage us through our website http://www.highplainspaw.org\n\nMessage the Facebook Page at https://www.facebook.com/HighPlainsPAW\n\nFill out our Adoption Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/adoption-application\n\nFill out our Foster Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/foster-application\n\nEmail us at highplainspaw@gmail.com\n\nCall our VOICEMAIL at (402)957-1578\n\nWE DO NOT HAVE A FACILITY ALL OUR DOGS ARE LOCATED IN FOSTER HOMES. This means there is no place for you to go in person to view our dogs. We ask that an application be filled out and we will go from there!",

She showed up on her foster's property severely underweight. She is very small for a lab and while she has been putting on weight, we don't think she will ever reach 50 pounds. Grace gets along well with male large dogs and is high energy especially when playing. She is crate trained, walks well on a leash, has a very sweet disposition, and likes a lot of attention. We think she would do well with children over age 13. We have no knowledge of how she would be around cats or livestock.\n\nGrace would do best in a dog savvy household that can help her continue to learn manners and harness her high energy. She would do best as an only dog or with a med/large male dog. She would not be best suited for a home with a female dog, small dogs, or cats.\n\nAll children at home should be at least age 5 to be approved for adoption!\nPacific Northwest adoption fee is $450 to help offset travel and medical expenses.",

She's a very sweet, very smart, energetic girl who needs daily exercise but is just as happy to snuggle up at night.  She's good with people of all ages.  She needs slow intros to other dogs but then does well, and might do best with a male, but she's perfectly happy to be an only dog as well. \n\nAutumn is probably right on the cusp of medium and large, just the right size.  She's around 4 years old and fully vetted.  She's beautiful and sweet and will make a lovely companion for someone.  \n\nAutumn's adoption fee is $250 and includes spay/vaccines/microchip, etc.",

Be sure to tell them ARK sent you! #ARKforCupid\n\n Cupid is an almost 3-year old, 50+-pound lab mix female located in Brockton, MA. She is very friendly as shelter staff and volunteers can testify! She is so sweet and precious, she gives great hugs, and her eyes are most expressive. \n\nA message from Cupid:\nHi ARK Friends! It\u2019s Cupid, again. That\u2019s right, I am back but I promise it\u2019s not my fault! If you remember, I lived at the Animal Protection Center of Southern Massachusetts for a long, long time, but landed a long-term foster gig early this year. I really liked it there and was a good girl (mostly, hey nobody\u2019s perfect!), but the nice man has a tough work schedule. We learned that I need an environment that is more stable and consistent. So I am back where my old buddies are taking me on field trips, play dates, and pack walks as much as they can. Still, I would love to be adopted for realz this time.\n\nI\u2019m a very smart dog who loves learning new things and solving problems. I enjoy any type of food puzzle. Seems like I can find a treat anywhere, so I\u2019m thinking of taking up scent work in my spare time. (I have a cute nose by the way!) You can hide treats all over the yard or house for me. Let\u2019s browse for DIY dog-friendly activities, too! \n\nI am best-suited for a small, active family that\u2019s outgoing and would enjoy being outdoors with me. All of my favorite things involve the outdoors, such as hiking, walking, and swimming. I am not suited for young kids, but teens who can help with consistency would be fun to play with. Now, as far as fur-siblings, it\u2019ll take a while for a symbiotic relationship, you\u2019ll just have to watch over me until I am used to things. I am ok around horses, but no cats or rabbits for me! \n\nMy foster dad likened me to a toddler that you need to watch and be one step ahead of at all times. Truth be told I can be a handful and harbor puppy tendencies. He\u2019ll also tell you I had to brush up on my house-training skills. I am my best with a routine and consistency. Please call or email to meet me!  508-586-2053, info@apcsm.org\nLove, Cupid xo\n\n\n~ THIS IS A COURTESY POST ~ PLZ DO NOT CONTACT MASSPAWS ~\n Please call or email to meet me!  508-586-2053, info@apcsm.org\nLove, Cupid xo\n\n",

            "description": "Squash is just adorable. He was adopted in January 2019 and was recently returned to us. He has neurological issues and general fear/anxiety. When he was adopted he had 1 seizure, but we don't know much about his medical history in the last year and a half. Unfortunately, he does have some neurological issues that affect his hind legs. Squash may walk a little funny, but he can walk and run like any other dog. He would not do well in a home with small children or a lot of activity. He takes a long time to warm up to new people and places so his forever family will need to be very patient. \n\nWe rescued Squash and his momma, Raddish, from Animal Control. Their owner had too many dogs and could no longer care for them, so she surrendered them. Squash was in a foster home when he was first rescued in 2018 and they told us, \"He is super affectionate and wants to be in the middle of any cuddle pile. He gets really bouncy when he\u2019s excited. He loves to jump in my lap to get some love from me and my dog Lady. I think he would be in heaven in a home with other energetic and affectionate dogs.\"  What a sweet boy! Squash's date of birth is 11/7/2017 and he weighs about 25 pounds.\n\nSquash has been neutered, is current on all vaccines, is on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, is microchipped, and comes with a 30 day pet health guarantee. The adoption fee is $95 with an approved application. A fenced yard is required. Visit fayettefcar.com to submit an application.",

            "description": "Mama T was brought in as an owner surrender. The owner could no longer take care of her. She is a little skittish but she warms up quickly.  HW+; 38lbs; 1-2 yrs old; lab mix; 8/27/18\n\nSafe- HAL\n\nUpdate Oct 16:  Mama T had 7 puppies.  Tragically all  7 of them did not make it.  The vet feels they had not been alive inside for some time now.  Not clear why they all died. \n\nFoster Update Nov 10: She\u2019s good with other dogs after she warms up to them. Loves to cuddle, crate trained, potty trained, and great on a leash. She does stay close by without a leash also.\n\n\nUpdate April 25: Mama T has a sad story to tell but still a joyful outlook. She came to the shelter when her owner was no longer able to care for her. She was pregnant with 7 puppies but sadly none of the 7 survived. Mama T hasn't let the loss of her puppies dim her sunny disposition though, she remains friendly and social with other dogs and especially loves getting love and attention from her person. She is a nice smaller size and packs a lot of love in a little package! She is a champion cuddler and walks wonderfully on a leash. Mama T has so much love to give to one very special person.  She is very affectionate and bonds with her person and thinks it is her job to be a protector.  Because of this instinct, we are recommending that she go into a one person home with someone who would appreciate a dog who wants to be their guardian and keep them safe. Mama T will make a wonderful companion for the right person. She is also crate trained and spent some time in a foster home where we discovered she was house trained as well. Mama T had her cat test and when she was walked by the cattery she didn't react to the kitties at all. This little love bug has waited for a forever home that will cherish her and treat her with love and the value every pet deserves. Let her spread a little of her love into your home, we think you'll never regret it!\n\nMama T gets some love and affection  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4G2ZSSXzc0&feature=youtu.be\n\nMama T and Sarge intro  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQBgD3fGwUM&feature=youtu.be\n\nMama T and Yvonne walking together https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFuh9m2wVUQ&feature=youtu.be\n\nAwesome Mama T gets lots of love  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7ISc28yaH8&feature=youtu.be\n\nMama T and her friend Ronnie  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwUjRuGHzy4&feature=youtu.be\n\nMama T's cat test, she's not interested!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sY7znzxFunw&feature=youtu.be\n\nMore Mama T and Sarge dog test  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0p112h0ZWI&feature=youtu.be\n\nSuper sweet Mama T, tail wagging! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct_xD99Mb58&feature=youtu.be\n",

Thankfully Bravo was able to rebound once he was placed in a foster home and is happy once again.\nBravo can still become scared at times and try to flee or hide. So he will need a home that has breed experience and is willing to continue working with him on his confidence.\nBravo will need a home that will be diligent with his safety and preferably has a privacy fence. A well balanced and confident dog in the home will also be required.\nThis boy has touched the hearts of many and we know there is a special home just waiting to help him continue his journey.\nPlease feel free to fill out an ADOPTION APPLICATION by clicking on the button below.\nThank You!\n\nor\n\nPETFINDER VIEWERS: Find our applications at www.midwestanimalrescue.org\n\n*The pet you are viewing is a rescued pet which is most often from an animal control facility and does not come with a pedigree. The breed(s) listed are our best guess and are in no way guaranteed. Sometimes the pets appear to be a particular breed(s) in the pictures we receive from our rescue partners and when they arrive we are surprised to see an entirely different breed(s) in person! If you choose to DNA test your adopted pet, test results may vary from company to company and our breed guess may not be reflected in those results as it is just that, our best guess. It is with deep longing that we wish there was a breed called \"cute\" as we believe all of our dogs would fall under this new breed classification!\n\n// 2/2/21 6:06 PM",

My dad\u2019s major life change has him traveling so much, it feels like all the time. Thankfully, he asked GPRA to find me a new home with a family who will always be around to rub my ears, hug me, and of course hand out many, many treats. So far, I have been an only dog and had a really quiet life with a quiet human. I need to work on some of my skills at home. I love to chase dogs passing by my window and sometimes I\u2019m a little nervous with people visiting my house. Are they friends? Do I protect my human? I get so confused. With a little help, I know that I can figure it all all. I love a nice soft sofa to snuggle up on and I\u2019m very happy when my people are home. I am ready for my own forever home and to start practicing all of those house skills so please email info@greatpyratlanta.com",

            "description": "(Version fran\u00e7aise disponible ici:  \n\nhttps://www.sitwithme.ca/fr/dogs/macaroon/)\n\nMacaroon\n\nAmerican Pit Bull Terrier mix\n\nFemale\n\n6 years old\n\n**Due to her breed label, she needs a home in an area that does not have restrictions on pit bull type dogs.  This means she must find her home outside of Ontario.\n\nDogs: She does do well with calmer dogs and can make friends, but needs slow and supervised introductions.  She would be quite happy as an only dog.\n\nCats: No, thank you.\n\nKids: No, thank you, only because she would prefer a calmer home life.\n\nHousing Type: Detached\n\nFenced in yard: Required\n\nSpecial Note: Macaroon is unsure shy when meeting new people but is easily managed for success with treats and kindness and must be given the ability to approach when she is ready (which is usually quite quickly and with gusto!).\n\n\nMeet Mac.  Mac is a beautiful girl ready to provide all of the drive by and bonking kisses you could ever want!  She adores her people and even making friends with even more people.  You see, she sees people as wonderful cuddling partners and just can\u2019t stand not giving out and kisses and cuddles like candy to kids on Halloween!   Mac knows a few impressive commands like sit, down, leave it and gentle and hopes that her new person would consider taking her to training classes or teaching her more as she is a fan of treats and praise too!\n\nMac is house and crate trained.  She is considered a low to medium energy girl and one walk a day and some play interaction with her people is enough to keep her very happy.  She is able to have dog friends but needs slow introductions as her first instinct is to not be fond of other dogs.  When Mac is in her crate, she will bark and so is not ideal in attached housing.  Speaking of barking, Mac is also a talker in play and will talk to you with grumbles and silly noises.  She\u2019s a bit of a clown sometimes and shows you both a goofy and sweet side.\n\nWhen meeting new people, as described above, Mac can seem shy.  This means she will needs some guidance to make sure interactions with people are always positive.  Forcing her into stranger situations, or living in a busy household (a home with new visitors weekly, for instance) might be too much action for Mac.  Once she knows someone, she certainly will shower them with love next time she sees them too.\n\nIf Mac sounds like the gal for you, please complete our online application: http://www.sitwithme.ca/dogs/macaroon\n",

Both dogs are extremely good climbers and are able to climb out of any fencing except perhaps high privacy.  They are gentle dogs, but both are very shy.  Even after being a The LAP Shelter for quite some time they often will not come inside their kennels when called and can be a problem tucking them in for the night.  A lot of patience will be needed in adopting both of these dogs.  Neither are in anyway aggressive.\n\nJo Ellen is sponsored by:  Mickey Thomas\nPhotography by:  Emily Manzano",

Can\u2019t wait to get his trust fund so he can donate some of it to PBS and post about it on social media.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Intake Date: 5 Nov 2018 \u2014- Adopted: 10 Dec 2018 \u2014\u2014 Returned to Rescue: 14 Nov 2020 ----- Age: 4 yr ----- Breed: Pug chihuahua cross ----- Size: 15 lbs ----- Status: owner surrender ----- Compatible with: dogs, cats, children ----- Suitable for: home with fenced yard. Apartment with adequate leashed exercise. ----- Medical/Behavioral Needs: FAT. ----- Additional Notes: Eldi came to us exactly 2 years ago as an abuse case. He was adopted and now returned 2 years later due to health issues in the family. He has been great in our house of 3 cats, 12 dogs and 4 sons! He wears a wrap because we are told he marks but he hasn\u2019t for us. He is a total couch potato and loves our 9 year old son. He is a sweet boy that is on a diet! -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- If interested in meeting and potentially adopting, please read the adoption requirements and complete the adoption application located at forbellessake.org. Once processed and approved a meet and greet can be scheduled and if a match an adoption can be finalized at that time. FBS standard adoption fee is $175. All residents are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, dewormed, microchipped, and treated for any known medical needs. Breeds are best guess. Housetraining is not guaranteed but crate training is worked on with all residents. A secure physically fenced yard is required.",

My foster Momma says I am the snuggliest puppy she has ever met. I love to play and stuffed animals are my favorite even though I was told I am not supposed to remove the stuffing but it's just so much fun. I do great with other dogs after a little introduction but I can play a little too rowdy. I have been told I am bossy so I would need a family that has submissive fur siblings or be the only dog. I am good with kids but would prefer older kids as little ones can be too much for me. I am 100% potty trained and use a doggie door. I need a home without cats because they look like a tasty snack. I love car rides and I'm always ready to go somewhere fun. I think I am a good gaurd dog and will bark to let you know there is someone who is at the door but don't let that scare you I am just hoping they are coming in to pet me. I am so happy my foster family saved me but would really love a furever family.",

To all of our potential adopters, please consider adopting or fostering animals close to home! To those potential adopters in other states, please remember us and revisit our available pet listing once the it is safe to travel more freely! Thank you!* \nRenee or Mama Renee, as we call her, came into our local shelter, as a stray, about to burst, she was so pregnant! Her nine beautiful puppies were born on Aug 18, 2018 in our foster care program. She was a wonderful mother and is now ready for a life of luxury with her forever family! We think her birthday is around Nov. 10, 2014. She would do great as an only dog in a home where her human will shower her with love and attention. She lives with lots of other dogs and foster puppies now but is ready to have a person and place to call her own.\nWe are unsure of Renee\u2019s true breed or age but we think she's a Labrador Retriever/Pit mix and about four years old. \nRenee is up-to-date on vaccinations, intestinal worm treatment, heart worm, flea and tick prevention and will be micro-chipped prior to adoption. Our foster families do their best to begin their house-training but please be patient with any dog you adopt. It's a learning process!\n\nIf you are ready for the work, time, patience, expense and commitment required to care for Renee her entire life, we welcome your adoption application! Sending us a completed application is the very first step so be sure to do that first thing! The adoption donation is $200. The adoption donation also includes a discount for our Canine Good Citizen Class. \n\nWhen applying for any adoption, please be aware that The Humane Society office is open Mon - Thurs from 10 - 3. We will respond to any inquiries or adoption submissions sent during non-office hours on the next day we are in the office. Thank you for your understanding!\n\nDog Adoption Guidelines:\n\nYou must fill out an application to be considered for adoption. You can find the application at www.ForThePets.org/adoption.htm or email humanesociety@murray-ky.net for an application.\n\nIt is not a first come process; we try to match the dog with the family for a FOREVER home. We process all applications at once and take the dog off the site, place on adoption pending status until a decision is made. If a suitable home match is not found, the dog returns to active status.\n\nThe dog adoption process can take up to two weeks; we are a small group of volunteers who mostly have full time jobs.\n\nAll of our dogs are indoor dogs with outdoor privileges, unless otherwise specified.\n\nWe do not fly or ship our dogs due to heat/cold concerns and safety issues. If you are willing to fly out AND fly the dog back in the cabin (size restrictions) with you, that would be considered.\n\nIf you apply to adopt a dog and are chosen, you must come to Murray, KY to pick up the dog and fill out the paperwork in person.\n\n\nWe can't provide individual meet and greet sessions for each applicant. If chosen to adopt, you will have plenty of time for your family and pets to visit with the potential new family member before signing any paperwork and will not be committed to adopt if you choose not to at that time.\n",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website. All of our dogs and cats are in foster homes and we have no paid staff. If you have questions concerning a specific animal, PLEASE fill out an application and the foster parent will be in touch. We will not arrange any home visits with any of our dogs and cats until your application is processed. Please understand our foster parents are precious to our 2nd Chance family; without them we cannot function, so we do our best to not burden them with multiple appointments. Our foster parents will choose their top 3 applications and arrange home visits with these applicants. The adopter will be chosen at that time. The process can take anywhere from a week to a month. We want to make sure our little furry ones are placed in their 'forever home' and never have to go through a rehoming again!My name is Taylor. I came to the ranch when I was 7 weeks old and have been here for almost 2 years. I have a bladder problem that cannot be surgically corrected. I could wear diapers but I absolutely hate them!! Here at the ranch I do not have to wear a diaper because they mop and steam floors several times a day but I drip and they don't make me feel bad about it :)I may spend my life here but if I do I will be loved and accepted even though I can't hold my bladder :)Please fill out an adoption application:\nAdoption application (Dog)\nAdoption Application (Cat)\n\nPlease understand we do not adopt out dogs to\nfamilies with children under the age of 5. We do not adopt dogs to renters. Some dogs will have fence requirements while others may not.\n\nA pet is a lifetime commitment. The dogs and cats in our system find themselves there, for the most part, because their humans did not have the same loyalty to them as they did to their owners. We do not take the adoption process lightly, and will do everything in our power to make sure the animal is placed correctly the first time around for your sake and theirs. Thank you for choosing to adopt not shop!",

            "description": "Lea likes to think of herself as a big baby! This lovely milk chocolate girl is a smidge under five years old and still has the playfulness of a pup. She loves long walks, car rides, and figuring out how to fit on your lap for a good long snuggle session! Lea enjoys playing chase-and-run and gentle wrestling with other big pups who match her enthusiastic energy level. When playing with her foster family, squeaky toys and chasing balls are two of her favorite activities. Although Lea loves everybody she meets, we don't recommend her for homes with little children on account of the fact that this goofy girl doesn't really understand her own strength when being affectionate! Lea has tons and tons of love and smiles to bring to the forever family that chooses her. If you are interested in meeting Lea go to la.bestfriends.org/adopt and fill out our Dog Adoption Survey and our team will reach out to you!",

I\u2019m still not sure why I ended up homeless. I was a good boy. I know I don't like to share my things with other animals but I am all you really need. I mean look at me. I would love a home to cuddle on the couch with my new human and watch tv, oh and eat some popcorn, or pizza, or chicken or... well anything really. I am around 6 years old and you can adopt me by going to www.libertyacresunited.com and submitting an application.\n",

Since he is anxious and afraid in new situations, he is very slow to warm up to new people and to new dogs. Once he's 10,000% comfortable, Mork loves people, cuddles, tummy rubs, treats and romping with his pup friends.As we know, with big personality comes big responsibility.

I love people and my foster mom says I am a cuddle bug. I would do best in a home with a physical fenced yard. I am a calm and quiet girl who is crate and house trained and walks well on a leash. I am very laid back and would prefer snuggling over play time. I prefer to be the only dog and cannot live with cats, rabbits or other small animals. Loud noises frighten me, so I would do best in a calm quiet home without small children. I love going on walks and car rides.

Quiet house preferred. \n\nGolf Buddy was trapped from a golf course by King's Island where he had lived for 6+ months. He had been let out from one of the people in the complex and abandoned. \n\nHe is very shy and quiet in the house. Enjoying being with you. He will allow some petting, but in general wants to be close. He sleeps on dog bed at night, crates up when asked (does not need in home without other fosters) and eats in his crate. He loves the other fosters, and is very vocal when playing with them. Not an aggressive bone in his body. Will not take treats. \n\nOutside he alerts to everything. Noise factor was one of the reason I was asked to trap him. Inside he does not make a peep. Recommended that he have outside access when owner home and kept inside when owner gone. He needs a secure fence with home visit. Must be within 50 miles of Cincinnati. No tie outs and no invisible fencing\n\nWould be considered a project dog, going to take time to become accustomed to another home situation. Does not tolerate a leash nor walk on one.\n\nAll of the adults in our program are fully vaccinated, spay/neutered, and have been microchipped.  The adoption fee is $175.

Maple is a fun and loving girl. Maple is a sweetheart, she loves to cuddle, she really likes being with you!! Maple really enjoys playing and snuggling with her people. We are unsure of how she would do with cats, so no kitties in the home. Maple would do best with older children because she's a big girl! Maple needs an owner who will carry through with firm leadership, and who will be consistent with training. Maple does need to be the ONLY dog in the home. Maple would do best with a fenced in yard or in a country setting.\n\nMaple is vaccinated for rabies, distemper, and bordatella. She is spayed and is microchipped. Maple's adoption fee is $350 plus WI state tax!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Maple, please fill out an application at luckypawsmidwest.org. Once your application is approved, we can set up a time for you to meet her!",

She is your perfect movie bing watching snuggle buddy. Mia's favorite thing is a bed with a cozy blanket. She is very attentive and seems to understand commands. Mia loves belly rubs. She is shy, but loyal and would make a wonderful companion. Mia would do best in a single pet household with older children (no babies or toddlers). Potential adopters can meet Mia at our rescue center, open 10-3 daily. \n\nAll dogs adopted through Troy Animal Rescue Project are up to date on vaccinations, spayed/neutered (age appropriate), and heartworm negative. All dogs are given monthly flea/tick preventative, monthly heartworm preventative, and are dewormed regularly. Dogs adopted through Troy Animal Rescue Project are microchipped. Adoption fee is $50. Home visit and vet reference required. Applications can be put in online at http://www.troyanimalrescueproject.org/adopt.php or in person at our rescue center.\n\nThe address for our rescue center is 34 County Road 2266, Brundidge, AL 36010. We are one turn off Hwy 167. If you use Google maps, type in Troy Animal Rescue Project and it will take you right to us. Hours of operation are from 10-3 daily. We are open Saturdays and Sundays. No appointment necessary for pets that are located at the rescue center. Appointments must be made to visit pets in foster homes. Location information will be listed beside the pets name if they are at a location other than our rescue center.\n\nQuestions can be emailed to troyanimalrescueproject@gmail.com or call 334-508-2367.",

We are very good dogs, we love food, walks, the outdoors, squeaky toys, car rides and so much more! We would love to find a home for the holidays! The perfect home for us would be one that takes us both, and with patient humans (we can be shy at first), also a home without cats! Our foster mom says we\u2019re housebroken and that I love to watch movies! (Shhh don\u2019t tell her I\u2019m really sitting still for all of the cuddles!) \n\nThe adoption donation for Karma and Twinkie is $250. This donation helps to cover veterinary expenses including spay/neuter, microchip and vaccinations.\n\nWish Upon a Rescue is a 501(c)3 non-profit, foster based animal rescue. If you would like to meet Karma and Twinkie, please complete our adoption questionnaire at www.wishuponarescue.org/adopt. We will review your responses and be in contact to schedule a meet and greet at a time and place convenient for your family and our team members.\n",

Being a little older, I've really learned to appreciate all the little things - but my two favorite things are being outside, and cuddling up with my people. The staff and volunteers here have worked on my walking skills, and one of them has even worked with me on being a great running partner (she tells me I'm a perfect running buddy, and I'm inclined to believer her...)! I can definitely keep up at pretty good pace, but when it's time to take a break, I'll admit I can be a bit of beach bum. Sometimes it's nice to just sit back, and take it all in. \n\nWhile I get to live out my dream every day of walks and playing outside, it all would be so much sweeter if I had a forever friend to wake up and hit the trails with every day. Fill out an application and mention me! \n\nMeet-Your-Match Caninality color is: Orange Busy Bee!!!\nFor safety's sake, we are looking for homes with physical fenced in areas.\nPlease fill out our online adoption survey at www.mackenzies.info",

Abandoned in rural Utah, Journey spent several weeks along the interstate alluding good Samaritans who tried to catch her.  Once caught and taken to the local shelter, poor Journey spent several more weeks cowering in the corner of her kennel growling and barking at anyone who came near.  She was just so frightened!   Finally, a shelter worker gained her trust and Journey's fun and playful personality came out.  Journey is still wary of people she doesn't know; but she warms up very quickly (typically 5 minutes or less).  She prefers women to men and is not tolerant of children (particularly small/young children)..  Journey is estimated to be 3-4 yr old.  She loves to play with other dogs once she feels comfortable with them (a proper introduction to a new dog is key); but, can be a bit of a pest, so a home without another dog or a puppy (who is as much of a pest as she is) would be best for her.   Journey is house-broken, crate-trained and walks well on a leash.  She is spayed and up-to-date on vaccinations.  If you are interested in meeting Journey, please respond to this post or contact kathie@herdinghaven.",

He is a bashful boy who is looking for an adopter to help him build confidence and realize his full potential. It takes Bailey a little while to warm up, but then he loves you. He likes playing with other dogs and enjoys being outside, basking in the sun.\n\nA home with other dogs is a must for Bailey, to help him feel secure. Bailey is not especially food motivated, but he likes cheese! \n\nThis boy will require an adopter who is committed to careful meetings. Due to his shyness, he will need to meet a couple of times prior to being adopted and moving into a new home. Bailey will also require a home with a physical fence. He is just learning to walk on the leash, so a fenced-in area will help him have comfort while getting to know his new family.\n\nIf you are interested in Bailey and would like to give him the loving home he deserves, please contact Mostly Muttz! You can apply to adopt Bailey at https://www.mostlymuttz.org/adoption-application/.",

PLEASE READ\n\nPosted animals are physically located at the above address except when indicated with the following notations after the animal's name:\n\nAnimal Name (FC=initials) -- indicates the animal is living in Foster Care. To meet the animal, please contact the foster directly when contact information is provided; otherwise call the shelter at 434 263-7722.\n\nAnimal Name (COURTESY) - this animal is posted as a public courtesy using information provided by the owner. Our shelter does not own or guarantee the information provided by the owner to be complete and accurate. Also, adoption does not involve our shelter but is strictly between the adopter and the owner.\n\nVERY SMART!!! GOOD HOUSE MANNERS!UPDATE 11/21/19:\nClaude is a large dog, just over 60 lbs. An all-American Mutt, he probably has some Collie, Great Dane, and Hound mixed in his heritage. His markings are similar to traditional black and white Border Collies. Claude has grey in his face, but it's not from old age. He's around 5 years old with plenty of spunk and energy, but enough maturity to settle down and enjoy the comforts of indoor living. Good looking Claude was found in early August 2018 as a stray. We don't know a lot about his background, but after spending several weeks in foster care his behaviors lend themselves to his having spent a substantial amount of time on a chain.\nClaude enjoys affection when he wants it, but not when he doesn't want it, and he can change his mind quickly. Difficult to read, he sends mixed signals to folks interacting with him.\nClaude hates living at our shelter because he hates being inside so much. Even though he gets yard time, it is never enough for him and it has gotten to the place where he has to be forced to go inside. We never like to force a dog to do anything, and Claude is a dog that does not like to be forced.\nFor the past 9 months he has been living in a foster home, with no incidents, with several dogs and cats. He loves the other dogs there, but he is \"too interested\" in the cats (though his foster mom has managed to keep the cats safe). She recently wrote: \"Claude wants to be essentially unconstrained, though he makes no attempt to get out of fencing. He became much calmer after he had been at my house for a couple weeks, no more jumping on me or tearing stuff up. He was great at the routine of going into his smaller yard during the day and waiting patiently to be let out into the big yard at night. During the day he often stayed in the very small room (with a dog door) attached to his yard, though he could have been outside. He seemed happier and friendlier after he'd been away from the shelter for a while. Now he really dislikes the confinement of the shelter. Claude would probably do best in a situation similar to his fosters (big fenced yard with other dogs, indoor/outdoor privileges, and no children), freedom mixed with restrictions, but without cats. I think he's a good dog whose had a bad start in life.\" He just doesn't want to be bossed around.\nIn a previous foster home last year (2018), his foster family learned:\nClaude wants very much to be social and be around people, but he has a hard time trusting them and can be defensive if he feels threatened. He is particularly sensitive about his collar and does not like to be grabbed or guided by it. When he came into the shelter, his old collar had a bolt in it that had rubbed into his neck. It was removed and replaced with a new collar, but Claude is still protective of his neck.\nHe jumps up wanting people to pay attention to him. Even though he can be told over and over to stop, he will continue to do so. This is a common behavior in dogs that have spent a lot of time on chains - their entire lives spent on their back legs looking for attention.\nHe pulls hard on a leash. Again, a common behavior for chained dogs who've strained against the restrictions of their small existence.\nHe is surprisingly good with other dogs, big and small. In his foster home there was a pushy, noisy, female German shepherd who is always yelling at him. Claude ignored her and removed himself from her vicinity, or appropriately corrected her if she pushed too far. The smaller dogs barked at him, but he paid them no mind.\nHe loves toys and will entertain himself with big balls like \"Jolly Balls\".\nHe was very interested in the cats in his foster home and barked at them. He met them in very controlled circumstances. He was not allowed to roam freely with the cats. He has seen chickens through fencing and tried to chase them. It is not uncommon for previously chained dogs to have strong prey drives, so a home without small animals such as cats or poultry is best.\nHe has good house manners and seems to be house trained. All dogs need refreshers in new environments, so his new family will need to provide him that guidance.\nHe rides well in the car, but will grumble if you try to pick him up into a high vehicle.\nHe has met children and is very excited to see them. Because Claude has trust issues he should not be adopted to a family with children and/or someone who has children visit. His new family should not be lulled into thinking his excitement is happiness and it is appropriate for him to be around children.\n- He needs work on his recall skills. Claude follows his nose (that hound heritage) and will wander away if given the chance. He will need a fenced yard to keep him safely at home.\nClaude is not a dog for beginner dog owners. He will require someone who is familiar with formerly chained dogs, and knows how to interpret his body language and stress signals.\nGOOD WITH DOGS. NO CATS. NO POULTRY. NO CHILDREN. NEEDS FENCED YARD.VOLUNTEERS and DONATIONS NEEDED. Visit our website for more info: http://nelsonspca.org",

I am a mix of a dapper gentleman, a stead-fast adventure pal, with a hint of a bad-boy. And will win you over with my big, brown eyes and gentle personality.\n \nI love it when people thrown my ball for us to play and just roll around in the grass. I also understand you need to work some time so will sleep at your feet to keep you company. When the day is done, I'll sit next to you but I sometimes forget I am not a puppy anymore when I crawl into your lap and hear a loud \"oof.\"\n \nAnother thing you should know about me is I'm board and trained meaning I got some mad skills. However, I will sometime test you so please give me some boundaries and help so I can stay on top of these skills. I respond well on the leash and will be a good boy on our walks. I do get excited when other dogs are around so be patient with me I am a cattle dog after all and love to look out for our home.\n \nDon't worry, I am definitely not bashful and will make myself right at home in your house, your yard, and win over your family. And I'm kennel trained, fully house trained, and will walk by your side on all our adventures. I am looking for someone to embrace my quirks and see this Forrest through all the trees.\n \n#forrestintheforest\n\nForrest video: https://youtu.be/c6-U02b9iok\n\nMore Forrest: https://youtu.be/pk4-PYNxt8k\n\nPlaying with Felix: https://youtu.be/PQClb5RvaNA\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

She loves to play and we believe she spent most of her life outside until she was rescued at the end of last year.  She loves to please but is still working on her basic commands.  She would do best as an only dog.  Moxie has had a rough early life. She was heartworm positive when she was rescued and had to have several growths removed.  She now has a clean bill of health, is heartworm negative and wants to find a family to give all her love to.\nBirth Date: 12/01/2010\n\nVisit SAFARI's website www.safarianimalrescue.org for a full listing of adoptable animals. Please check out the Upcoming Events menu for a list of upcoming adoption events.\n\n**Please contact us before an adoption event, to verify that the animal you are interested in will be in attendance. \n\n***At this time we are unable to accommodate out of state adoptions, or adoptions outside the metro Detroit area. Information requests on any of SAFARI's animals should be directed to us via email. With the call volume we receive, we are unable to return all inquiry phone calls due to time restraints. Listed breeds are a best guess based on animal appearance, and should in no way be considered a guarantee of breed.\n\nSpecial Animal Friends and Rescue, Inc. (SAFARI) is a non-profit, no-kill,  foster based animal rescue. SAFARI is currently seeking foster parents, volunteers, and donation to fund the continued rescue of these deserving animals. \n\n**Please note: SAFARI requires all applications to be submitted in person at an adoption event. All family members should be present for the application and the in-person interview with a member of our Adoption Approval Committee. All applications will require a home inspection prior to final approval.**\nA fenced yard may be required for bully breeds, and some dogs may require a household where all children are over the age of 5.***",

She doesnt like harsh tones and thinks she is in trouble if you say Abigail.  She wags her tail a lot.    She is not aggressive with her food or toys.    She is very curious about her surroundings.  She loves looking out the window.  Abbie is around 3 years young. Her vet records say PitX, but we believe her to be more on the Foxhound/Boxer mix side. Abbie is UTS on all her shots, housebroken, HW neg and microchipped. She LOVES people, but we recommend that she be an only dog. She does very well on leash walking and loves to go on walks.Abbie is a big girl around 60 lbs. If you would like to meet Abbie please let us know!!",

I'm really picky about my  other dog friends but I really like being the center of my person's world.  I can share I just rather not.    I can spend my days lounging on the sofa or strolling in the park. As long as you are near I'll go anywhere.  Those small humans are ok as long as they aren't too small. The ones under 3 are kind of wobbly on their feet and I'm kinda scared I'll make them fall over.  I think kids over 5 or 6 would probably would be more fun.  If you think you could use some BoBo in your life please call Ms Rhonda \n256-200-2094. you will also need to go to www.brindleemountainanimalrescue.com, click on \"our Animals\", scroll down and complete an application.",

This is creating an uncomfortable and unsafe situation for all involved. While they are truly devastated they know this is the best choice for Molly as well as for them and their growing beautiful family. The situation is obviously very urgent as not only does Molly's wellbeing hang in the balance but also the life of a little baby girl.\n\nMolly needs a calmer environment without young kids, she would likely be fine around older children 10+. \n\nIf you're interested in fostering or adopting this darling chunk of perfection please contact us!",

            "description": "Lois is a seriously gorgeous 10 year old GSD. Lois loves to be brushed. As she gets brushed I can see the smile spread across her face into her eyes. She'll roll from side to side allowing me full access to giving her the royal treatment and an enjoyable brushing. She's lay there all night being brushed while you watch TV with her. At home Lois is laid back and very affectionate, she's an attention hog and doesn't want to share her people with another pet. Lois would do better as an only pet. Lois is great riding shotgun on car rides. She doesn't mind the backseat either. Either seat she is the happiest of travelers. It makes me laugh out loud to see how excited she gets when she realizes she's going for a ride. If you would like to add Lois to your family please click on the link below to fill out our adoption application!\n\nhttp://baileyswayrescue.org/adoption-application",

We are not sure of exact age. He does ok with other dogs but can be picky on who he likes or doesn't. He is not a big fan of cats. No kids. If interested in adopting please fill out application at middletennesseetreasures.com. \n\nAdoption fees is $200.\n\nOur dogs and cats are kept in foster homes with volunteers who share their homes with these animals until the right adoptive home is found. These foster homes evaluate for temperament and also work on basic training with the dogs. Our dogs and cats have been seen by a vet, brought up to date on vaccinations, micro-chipped, heartworm tested, cleared of parasites and spayed or neutered if 6 months or older. \nThe first step in adopting from Middle Tennessee Treasures is to complete an adoption application.(http://www.middletennesseetreasures.com/adoption/) Vet references are usually called first. When we contact your vet we ask about current and past pets (both dogs and cats). We ask if all animals are spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccinations, seen on a yearly basis and whether dogs are on heartworm preventative. Personal references are called and finally a home visit is set up. The purpose of the home visit to meet you (must live with in 40 miles of Murfreesboro), your family, and any pets you may have. It also allows us to see what kind of dog or cat would be the best fit for your home. \nThis screening process helps to ensure that each rescued dog is placed in a loving, safe, and permanent home. We do not place our dogs on a first come, first serve basis, but according to the needs of the dog and family.",

She spent most of her time keeping off to the side but once she came into heat, the male dogs were all over her.   She recently had a litter of 7 pups and a local neighbor intervened to help care for the pups and also Clara.  Clara is so thrilled to now have some attention.   She thrives on receiving love and gives it back. She is very gentle, ignores cats, and gets along great with other dogs. She is no longer spending her life hiding in the back of a pen trying to avoid the large male dogs.   She is a docile girl and is submissive to most other dogs she has been around. Her second chance will now be complete when she heads on to her new home!   Note: She is a sweetheart.  9/1/2018; hw-; 1 yr old; 50lbs\n\nSally and Clara\nhttps://youtu.be/BhYhBWMALNg \n\nhttps://youtu.be/ZDeMYg9qJFs  \n\nhttps://youtu.be/BhYhBWMALNg \n\nsweet Clara June 1\nhttps://youtu.be/Ny4uVJ3D-xI\n\nClara and foster dad June 1\nhttps://youtu.be/KNHZlhfuPtQ\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ZDeMYg9qJFs",

Enzo can bite if cornered or feels intimidated and therefore a child-free home is a must.  We are also looking for an experienced adopter of abused dogs as Enzo will need some training and bonding time to feel comfortable.  Once Enzo has imprinted on his owner, he is the sweetest little boy, he is about 8lbs and is a TOTAL LAP monkey, he loves cuddling in laps and loves leash walks, gets along with dogs (we don't know about cats) he's got such expressive little eyebrows and loves everyone he meets.  Enzo was quick to house train, he's not a big fan of the dog crate but loves the elevated dog bed.  He is neutered, vaccinated, and microchipped!

I am now in a foster home that is cool and all but I would really like a family of my own. I am best with dogs that are bigger than me and I would be ok as an only as long as my people were home with me a lot. I am really a one person dog and once I pick that person I will go to the ends of the earth to hang out with them and be with them. I need a fenced yard in my new home too. I like women much more than men. I am actually afraid of men so it would seem that one wasn't very nice to me at some point. I would probably be fine once I realize that they aren't going to hurt me but that will take some time. My way of communication includes grumbles and mini growls but I don't mean anything by it and I listen very well when corrected. I like a routine and I sure don't mind being lazy all day if that's your thing. Everyone who has met me thinks I am a pretty cool dude. I even got to be interviewed on TV showing what a neat dog I am in hopes of finding a family. Did you see that? No? Ask my rescue to send you the link.\nIf you would like to meet me, send an email to theloveofk9s@yahoo.com. Please allow 24 hours for a reply.\n\nAdoption donation pays for all vetting...neuter, a heart worm test, all vaccinations, deworming, flea prevention and a wellness exam.",

He likes to take some time to observe new people before jumping right in for pets but once you have his trust, it is magical! \n\nRalfi is super calm inside.. he will snooze in his bed ALL DAY LONG! Once he is outside his brain is fully awake and he's ready for play.. sometimes he gets a little too playful and opts to jump on his handler, grab shoes and pretty much anything hanging within his reach! It was pretty cute and entertaining at first BUT clearly behavior a polite LOVE DOGS Pit Bull ought not be doing...  SO ...we've put him in a bit of a.. finishing school and he loves it! To Ralphie, obedience and learning is super fun for Ralfi. Its all a game to him and the more interaction the better. He soaks up praise and works for more! \n\nRalfi really enjoys being out and about.. hiking in the woods is one of his favorite things to do.. he is an active boy with an awesome chill button -- Ralfi does well with most other dogs. He often attends meetings and takes turns lounging in laps enjoying belly scratches and love gazes!! He's fun to have around... there's ALWAYS something about Ralfi that'll crack you up! \n\nFor more information and photos of Ralfi, be sure to visit our website at fortheloveofdogsrescue.org!!\n",

He is also very high energy so a home that has a fenced-in yard is a must. \n\nBo likes to play tug with toys and he LOVES to cuddle!

She still has puppy tendencies with jumping and nipping in excitement so no small children for her at this time. But she is working on learning her manners and doing well with basic commands and continuous training. \n\nAngel likes all types of toys and likes to carry her favorite with her when she goes outside to play. She prefers companionship over everything. She likes to snuggle and give kisses. \n\nAngel would do best in a home with a fenced-in yard due to her energy level. \n\nCould you be Angel's wings to help her fly?",

At one year old he had had very little human contact and it has taken us over a year to gain his trust, now he is ready to begin the search for his forever family. Moo Moo is shy at first but is very affectionate. Moo Moo is neutered, microchipped, up to date on shots, he was heartworm positive and is being treated.  He gets along with other dogs his size but has had no exposure to cats or children.  He walks pretty well on a leash, but can still get over whelmed at times.  He is crate trained and will let you know if he needs to go outside. A fenced yard is must for this boy.  If you have a true rescuers heart, you can email Sunny at  sunnyharting@yahoo.com .\n",
