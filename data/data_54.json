            "description": "This pretty lady is Mama Baker! She is a ~3 year old mixed breed who weighs about 60 pounds.  When she first came to us, she had a belly full of puppies.  They all found their forever homes and Mama Baker is still eager to find her pawfect match!\n\nMama Baker is sweet as pie, but she is also very timid at first. She'll need an adopter who will go slow and be patient with her while she adjusts to her new surroundings - new situations can be scary for a timid gal like her. An experienced dog owner who is willing to work with her on her fear would be ideal.  Once she warms up and realizes she's safe and loved, she will love you unconditionally.  Mama Baker is very gentle and loves to snuggle and lay her head on her person's lap. Keep in mind that her unconditional love can also lead her to be protective of her people.  For this reason, she needs a home with no other dogs.  It will also be necessary for her new family to let her hangout in another room if there are visitors. \n\nMama Baker prefers to hangout with adults and warms up to them much quicker than children, so she kindly requests no kids under the age of 16 in her forever family.  As with any visitor, if you have children that visit or neighborhood kids, Mama Baker would feel much safer and more comfortable if you let her hang out in another room.  A secure fence is a requirement to adopt Mama Baker.\n\nIf you can provide Mama Baker with the home environment she's looking for, apply to adopt today!  Her minimum adoption fee is $235 plus a $12 fee, if 4 months or older, for rabies registration for McLean County residents.\n\nShe has been spayed, microchipped, vaccinated, heartworm checked, dewormed, and is on flea and heartworm preventatives.\n\nFor information about this dog's breed(s), visit: http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/abc.htm \n\nTo fill out our adoption application, go to: http://fs16.formsite.com/WishBoneCanineRescue/adoptionapplication/index.html",

            "description": "Meet Jayden! Jayden is a dashingly handsome 1-year-old mixed-breed guy who currently weighs about 51 pounds. He came to SFAS as a stray found wandering the city. Now he is ready for a loving family to call his own. Here at the shelter Jayden has been friendly with humans and dogs alike and enjoys going on nice long walks with his favorite person. If you have other dogs at home please let the scheduler know you would like to bring them along for a Meet n' Greet. Jayden's adoption fee is $130. He is neutered, microchipped and has age-appropriate vaccinations. A licensing/microchip fee may apply. Interested in meeting with Jayden or being added to his waitlist? Please call (505) 983-4309 x 1610 and leave a voicemail message that includes the DOG'S NAME, plus YOUR NAME and A PHONE NUMBER - OR e-mail this information to adoption@sfhumanesociety.org. A scheduler will call you back within 48 hours to confirm your request. SFAS offers a variety of excellent training classes, seminars and Trainer Talks led by animal behavior professionals. These are $50 off for animals adopted from any shelter or rescue group! Due to current COVID-19 restrictions, classes and talks are all presented virtually using Zoom.

She has been living outside in a kennel and gets along with other dogs. She is about 47 lbs and is very excited and friendly and needs a little direction. She does not like CATS. She likes to play with a ball and will play fetch - she also likes rope toys. She is treat motivated and working on basic commands such as sit, stay, down, and leave it. She does pull a little bit here and here when walking. On a short lead she is content beside you. She will tuck her tail and cowers a bit at loud noises. She likes to be close to you and cuddle. Ladybug got to go Home for the Holidays. While she was away for the week we found that she: loves people and other dogs but needs to be slowly introduced and integrated into the 4 legged part of the family. She loves stuffed and squeaky toys. She is working on becoming housebroken and will walk around when she has to go out. Ladybug will sleep on the floor on a doggy bed if you want her to but prefers to sleep in the people bed. Please call and schedule an appointment if you would like to meet her.",

            "description": "This beautiful girl is Magnolia and she is looking for her forever home. Magnolia came to Animal Friends via transfer with another shelter. She is about 3 years old and 75 pounds.\nMagnolia is deaf. She would need a family that would be willing to work with her and learn how to communicate effectively with her. Magnolia also has lots of energy. She enjoys going for walks, sniffing, and exploring. Using her brain is another one of Magnolia's favorite pass times. She would love a new family that would be willing to keep her active and continue her training. \nMagnolia would do best in an adult only home. She can be a little selective with other dogs and she can not live with cats. A family with dog experience would be beneficial for Magnolia as well.\nIf you are interested in adopting Magnolia, you will schedule several meet and greet appointments to work one on one with the staff and volunteers who know her best. This will give you time to get to know Magnolia and her cues, while starting to bond with her.\nThe first step to any adoption is filling out an application (thinkingoutsidethecage.org/application). If you have any questions, please reach out to the adoption team (adoptioninfo@thinkingoutsidethecage.org)",

He is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4511568.\n\nReno is a beautiful brindle dog that needs a furever home! Reno loves to go for a walk and can't wait to get out of his kennel so he can GO!! He will start out in a run because he's so happy to get out but once he walks for a while, he settles down and walks at a fast pace. He likes to go out to the play yard and do the \"zoomies\" and he'll also come up and \"sit\" for a treat. Reno has shown that he doesn't like the other dogs in the kennels next to him and he will definitely need a dog introduction for someone who already has dogs at home.\n\nIf you think you'd like to meet Reno and see if he's a good fit in your home, come to the MCACC shelter today. Reno would love to go home soon!\n\nIf you are interested in saving this pet, please reach out via this link: https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/foster/BPAZ/Dog\n\nTo actually visit with this pup, please make an appointment here: https://mcaccappointments.as.me/adopt. NOTE: People who sign up for these appointments often no-show, and we have seen that you can generally show up and let them know you are there to meet this particular dog and the shelter will squeeze you in, except from 12-3PM or closer to the 6PM closing time. (Please know this is not a guarantee). If the dog is at risk, please ask for a supervisor to meet that particular dog.\n\n*Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG. MCACC is located at 2500 S. 27th Avenue, Phoenix. Different adoption fees/policy may apply. Please visit MCACC's website http://www.maricopa.gov/pets/locations.aspx for hours. You may also wish to call 602-506-7387 (PETS) and provide the animal's A# above to verify is still available.",

He's as tall as a med sized dog, but a thin frame. He loves to sit on your lap and being cradled like a baby.\nUnfortunately, we believe Jesper may have been mistreated and is affraid of being hurt. He's looking for a very patient family that uses care when handling him. He can be sensitive to touch during certain situations and may be a little nippy to let you know he's uncomfortable and doesn't like something. We recommend adults only in the home.\n\nJesper may be better as an only pet or maybe one other pet. His housebreaking is still in progress. He does better with a consistent schedule and may need to be crated when unsupervised or use a gate to limit his access.",

He wasn\u2019t finding his family while at county, so he has come to Home Fur Good to see if he can find that perfect fit.  When Viktor first arrived at county, he was so nervous around the leash that they had to use the transport bucket to wheel him from place to place.  By the end of his stay at county they were able to take him on walks off-campus.  HFG looks forward to having Viktor join the Dog Walking Club to help him gain his confidence on leash adventures.  Viktor is very friendly and willingly comes out of his kennel for anyone; he is always amped up for an adventure. The adoption fee is $225 and includes spaying/neutering, age-appropriate vaccinations, microchipping, and a free wellness visit at Phoenix Mountain Animal Hospital. Our adoption hours are Thursday-Saturday from 11:00 am-4:00 pm by appointment only.",

Charlie got to where he was nipping at the owner and will need time and training to teach this handsome guy some manners. He has been great with the shelter staff but does not seem fond of other dogs. We also do not believe he likes cats but he does seem to be house broken since he keeps his kennel pretty clean. We would not recommend he go to a home with kids since he has a tendency to nip. Charlie weighs around 58 pounds and is HEARTWORM NEGATIVE as of 1-12-21.\n\nHis adoption fee is $61.50 and he can be microchipped for $8.25. Due to the outbreak of Covid-19 our adoption policies have changed. All adoptions are by appointment only. Call to set up an appointment to meet the animal. Dogs are $61.50 and puppies are $59 unless otherwise noted. All cats and kittens are $44 unless otherwise noted. Our system automatically updates petfinders every two hours.

In 2018 Chance was in a high kill facility and needed our help. Chance arrived to us covered in ticks and getting sick. Once we had his nursed back to health he showed us how happy and goofy he is. A few months later Chance was adopted. In early 2020 he had become protective of his new human and had an issue with her boyfriend. For safety Chance was returned to us. Chance lives in a foster home with a male and female and does not show these behaviors to them. Chance has been adopted briefly to another home where he would growl and lunge at the man of the house but never the woman or son. We have introduced him to many men at stores and in home and have yet to have an issue with him ourselves. We are looking for a specific type of home for Chance to help him succeed in finding his forever home.\n\nFor Chance we are looking for a home that will have no kids, no cats, no dogs under 40lbs, no other small animals. All of that is due to his prey drive and history. Chance will also need a home that is able\n\nto walk him or use tie outs\n\nto let him out. He will run away off lead and can escape a secure privacy fence by climbing over it.\n\nThe most important thing we will be looking for is someone with experience working with dogs or the ability to work\n\nclosely with a trainer to overcome any issues that come up.\n\nChance is a happy, bouncy, sweet boy.\n\nHe is 4-5 years old and about 40lbs.\n\nHe loves hard and wants to show his affection to anyone he trusts. Chance loves other dogs once he gets to know them but does not like to be rushed by them at first or he will become defensive. He has 7 other dogs in his foster home and he gets along with everyone great. He is kennel trained, house trained, and has leash manners once he gets in the groove. We hope to find Chance the perfect home to work with him if things get tough and love him endlessly as he will them.\n\nHe has a history of being a runner but is comfortable on leash and on a tie out. He can escape a secure fence. He is house and kennel trained. Chance is a happy guy looking for a lifelong companion to help him be the fantastic guy he can be! If your family could use a wonderful fur friend like Chance please go to our website at www.emmetcountyanimalshelter.org to fill out the dog adoption application. Chance is ready for his forever home and his foster family is ready to rescue another pup in need. His adoption fee is $225.00_ and he is fully vetted and Microchipped.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Meet Chief! This handsome boy is a laid-back gentle giant. Born around January 2018, he is thin at 70 pounds. His ideal weight is closer to 90 pounds, and he'll get there after enjoying lots of yummy vittles and soaking up more tender loving care.\n\nSweet Chief is very loving. He loves being petted and being near his humans. He doesn't need toys to feel happy; he is super content just finding a comfy spot to lay inside or outside. At night, he loves sleeping next to you on the floor even when he has access to the rest of the house. He's hasn't yet shown interest in getting on furniture.\n\nChief does really well with someone home with him all the time. He also does fine when his people leave the house, he just needs a few minutes to get used to the idea, then he relaxes until you return.\n\nHe loves exploring and going on adventures! He is the best wingman on hiking trips - everyone along the way loves him and he is so good on the leash.\n\nChief must have a large fenced-in yard with lots of space to roam, run, and relax. Outdoors is his happy place!\n\nMr. Man (one of his nicknames) is house trained and he rarely barks. He has no need to be crated, and that's good, because he hates it!\n\nHe really enjoys car rides, but he needs convincing to get in it. For now, he needs a booty assist. In time, he might associate car rides with fun adventures, then he might climb in willingly. He wants to join you in a front seat! You'll need a firm blocking technique or strong netting to keep him safely in the back.\n\nHe adores being outside. He needs a sturdy, tall fence to keep him contained in the yard.\n\nHe is nice with other dogs, and he does fine with them at mealtime.\n\nChief will be an ideal family dog. He yearns for people to include him in their daily lives.\n\nSPIN Pyrs are all in foster homes in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. Potential adopters are asked to make travel arrangements if they live elsewhere. All SPIN dogs are spayed or neutered, current on vaccinations and on heartworm prevention. Please go to our website www.SpinRescue.org and fill out an application for this great Great Pyrenees!",

I would love to have someone help teach me basic obedience, and if you could, I would love to learn agilty or other dog sports. The staff here think I would pick it up easy with my toy motivation. I have been very scared of the men at the shelter, I will bark and growl at them until they go away, what can I say, I'm a ladies man.\n\nThe ideal placement would be with someone who understands working breed drive, can provide 1-3 hours of exercise a day, and help him overcome his fear of men. It would be a plus to engage him with any dog sports. Please ask staff members about me to get more info or to meet me.",

She had likely been hit by a car and has mammary masses. Beautiful and so friendly with gorgeous bi eyes that look right through you. Calia is a delightful dog that deserves so much more than what she has gone through. She just received some major grooming and looks terrific. She went to the vet to have her masses and xrays of her rear. More on that soon.\n\nCalia is currently in a foster home and this is what they have to say so far.\n\nCalia is showing zero signs of being an escape artist or even wanting to leave our property without us.\n\nShe is soooo happy lounging next to one of us and seems completely content just being inside the house hanging around her humans. This girl may be better as a solo dog but also seems fine with the other dogs- just doesn't engage them much and Calia would be an amazing addition to a family.",

If there is an applicant, it will say PENDING ADOPTION next to the dog's name. If not, please submit an Application that can be found on our site, www.fluffydog.net. \n\nMY AGE: approx. 8 weeks (1/21)  WEIGHT: approx. 4 lbs. (1/22)  WHERE I AM FROM: AL (arrival 1/16) \n\nMY STORY: This litter is just adorable. They are quite small, but also young. We asked the vet if they were going to be large or small dogs, and she said she had no idea. You could either look at weight charts or ask your vet based on the age and weights at 6 weeks. That is difficult, but being so young hard to say. I think we are about middle of the road. We have not seen either parent.\n\nWe don't know the breed, but from weight charts adult weight might be 30 lbs.\n\n\nThis dog does shed and is not hypoallergenic.\n\nHOUSEBROKEN?   GOOD WITH DOGS?  Yes  GOOD WITH CATS?unknown\n\nADOPTION FEE: $650\n\nTo adopt the FIRST STEP is to complete an APPLICATION. The application can be found on our site www.fluffydog.net, or by clicking on the purple Fluffy Dog Rescue wording found in the left corner of this page under the dogs name.\n\nOur dogs are located in foster homes throughout the state. We do not have a facility. Adopters must be 24 years old.We can not adopt to families with children under the age of six. We also adopt in WI, IL, and parts of MN. Most of our dogs are strays, so the breed is our best guess.\nWI License #270548.\n \nCheck out Fluffy Dog Wellness on our Home Page. Great Solutions to Enhance Your Pet's Health. www.fluffydog.net",

He does like to give gentle hugs where he wraps his little paws around you, but he also responds to correction very well. He is submissive enough and will sit patiently for brushing, bathing, whatever! This boy is mellow but still likes to play. He walks fine on leash and we are working on sitting for treats, he prefers to dance instead. He would make the perfect addition to any family!! He will be UTD and neutered before adoption.

If there is an applicant, it will say PENDING ADOPTION next to the dog's name. If not, please submit an Application that can be found on our site, www.fluffydog.net. \n\nMY AGE: approx. 8 weeks (1/15)  WEIGHT: approx. 10 lbs. (1/15) WHERE I AM FROM: AL (arrival 1/16) \n\nMY STORY: We are just getting to know these guys and considering they are pups really won't have much more info on them. They are typical pups that have no housebreaking, love to run and play, will play bite as they need to do that to get their adult teeth coming in, and also will do a small amount of snuggling. Many people want a snuggly puppy, but I have not found such a thing. They are busy, busy or sleeping. \n\nDogs are held for two weeks after arrival date. You are welcome to apply, but applications will be processed closer to the available date.\n\nDogs needing foster homes are available for adoption This dog does need a foster home. Have you ever considered fostering a dog?  For more information, see the Fluffy dog rescue home page. This dog does shed and is not hypoallergenic.\n\nHOUSEBROKEN?   GOOD WITH DOGS?  Yes  GOOD WITH CATS?unknown\n\nADOPTION FEE: $550\n\nTo adopt the FIRST STEP is to complete an APPLICATION. The application can be found on our site www.fluffydog.net, or by clicking on the purple Fluffy Dog Rescue wording found in the left corner of this page under the dogs name.\n\nOur dogs are located in foster homes throughout the state. We do not have a facility. Adopters must be 24 years old.We can not adopt to families with children under the age of six. We also adopt in WI, IL, and parts of MN. Most of our dogs are strays, so the breed is our best guess.\nWI License #270548.\n \nCheck out Fluffy Dog Wellness on our Home Page. Great Solutions to Enhance Your Pet's Health. www.fluffydog.net",

She does take a little time to warm up but once she does she will be your absolute best friend! Ashley is good with other dogs, cats, bunnies and kids over 12 years old. Ashley really enjoys playing with stuffed toys, chewing on bones, car rides, and giving kisses when she cuddles! \n\nIF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING, PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n- The first step towards adoption is to complete an adoption application, which can be found online at our website www.roadtriprescues.com, under the \u201cADOPT\u201d tab.\n\n- Do not use the Petfinder links or email to ask us about our adoptable dog listings - we do not always receive these messages and will not respond to them.\n\n- Please do not ask if a dog is still available - we do our best to update their status as quickly as possible.  If a dog is listed for adoption, it means we have not yet approved an adopter and are still accepting applications.\n\n- PLEASE NOTE THAT ONLY APPROVED ADOPTERS WILL BE PERMITTED TO MEET OUR RESCUES - WE ARE A FOSTER BASED RESCUE AND ALL OF OUR DOGS LIVE WITH US AS FAMILY. \n\nThanks for considering a rescue pup!",

We're more mature in age than others at the shelter which just means we know what we want in life. Give us a cozy bed and a loving family and we're two happy dogs. We're more mellow so we don't require a lot of excercise or attention, just a nice evening walk and some playtime is a good day for us. Since we are older we do need a little more medical attention than those young whipper snappers though. So if you have room in your heart and your home for two older pups, then we would love to meet you and get aquainted. Our friends at the shelter would be happy to set up an appointment!",

(especially if theres a treat or two involved). Im starting to figure out my new digs, and while I miss my friends at Wilco, Im making so many more here at AAC! Im also starting some force/fear free training with my new human friends, and am so excited to know so many good boy tricks! I love ALL THE THINGS!!!- Cheese, chicken, hot dogs, lamb loaf, training treats, bones ... Oh! And dont mind my big-boy borks when you first walk up... its just my way of saying Hi! I am silly and goofy and full of playful energy, the kind of dog that will have you laughing at my antics every day. The kind of dog that has a special knack for bringing a smile to your face, no matter what kind of day you're having! Im dreaming of a forever home with my own person. Is that you? Scout is one of our very first Shelter Exchange Program participants from Williamson County Regional Animal Shelter. The Shelter Exchange Program is an innovative new partnership to give longstay dogs stuck in the shelter system exposure to new adopters and a new community in hopes of finding them the perfect family.

She is eager to learn and is a quick learner. She is highly treat motivated and would do well with a positive reinforcement based training regimen. We have been working on the \"touch\" command with her to help with her focus, and she also knows \"sit\".\n\nShe would do best with owners who have an active lifestyle, and that can give her lots of enrichment and exercise. Baby is not able to go home to a family with other animals as she is reactive due to past trauma. \n\nWe think it is best that Baby not go home to a home with children under the age of 15 due to her energy level and fear based behaviors towards children due to previous experiences. \n\nBaby is an amazing girl who just needs someone to take a chance on her so she can be the most precious version of herself.\n\nIf you are interested in temporarily fostering her, please send us an email adopt@foxvalleypets.org .",

            "description": "Lovely Lucy is big (some might call her big-boned), beautiful lady who is learning to blossom. Timid and sensitive in new environments, Lucy was at first reserved and unsure about kennel life but she's slowly started to realize that people can be friends! And as she does, she shows off her more fun and bubbly personality. In the hubbub of the kennel, Lucy's adorably wrinkled face is often creased into a look of concern and she is quite watchful of all that's going on - but in quieter, peaceful moments she reveals her capacity for affectionate and love! Plus, you will discover a delightful secret soon after getting to know her... Lucy has a charmingly derpy overbite! Lucy would likely thrive in a quiet home where she can build her confident and trust - we believe once she settles, she will make an adoring companion. Lucy is estimated to be around 4 years old and she weighs a slightly thick 78 lbs. \n\nVisit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog to set up a meet with Luc\nDue to COVID-19, CITY DOGS is currently doing adoptions by APPOINTMENT ONLY. Please visit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog to request a meet and greet! \n\nQuestions? Email: citydogs@city.cleveland.oh.us | Call: (216) 664-3476\nVisit: 9203 Detroit Avenue Cleveland, OH 44102\n\nHours:\n10 AM - 3 PM Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday\n10 AM - 6 pm Tuesday & Thursday\n\nFee: $61 | Includes spay/neuter, shots, microchip, license, 30 days free pet insurance (when registered upon adoption)\n\nThe CITY DOGS mission is to increase adoptions from the City Kennel by changing the image of the pit bulls who make up the majority of the kennel population, by preparing all adoptable dogs in the kennel for lives in loving homes and by creating as many opportunities as possible for the public to meet and get to know our dogs for the terrific pets they are meant to be.\n\nOur Adoption Process...\nHere's a little about how things work:\nAll of the CITY DOGS posted for adoption are available for direct adoption from the kennel, unless noted otherwise. You must schedule a meet with a dog in advance - we are not currently accepting walk-ins. Please look online first to see if there are any dogs you think would be a good fit for your home before scheduling a meet. To get the process started, visit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog and fill out the form. One of our adoption counselors will get in touch to schedule and confirm your meet! At the kennel, an adoption counselor will introduce you and your family to the adoptable dogs, share information we know about them, and discuss our suggested ways for successfully integrating a new dog into your home. You are welcome to meet multiple dogs. If the dog you adopt is already fixed, he or she may leave with you that day - otherwise, the dog can go home after receiving the spay or neuter surgery.)\n\nAbout Our Dogs: All available dogs have gone through a behavioral and medical assessment. This assessment is a snapshot of who the dog is at that given time. We cannot make any guarantees with regard to behavior, temperament or health of any City Dog once they are in the home. Most of our dogs are picked up as strays, so we do not know what kind of home environment they were living in (i.e. with kids, other dogs or other cats), nor do we know if most of them are house trained. Everything we know about them is based on volunteer and staff observations. We do have some dogs in foster homes, where they will have more information about how the dog is in a home environment. It is very hard to tell with certainty whether or not a dog will be good with kids, cats or another dog. If you have kids in the home or another dog, we do require that they be present for a meet and greet with the dog you are considering for adoption.\n\nHeath/Vaccinations: Dogs that are adopted directly from the kennel need to go to your personal vet within two weeks of leaving the kennel. All dogs receive their DAPPL, Rabies, and Bordatella vaccines, though you may be required to get follow up boosters. All dogs come microchipped and with a Cuyahoga County license.?  \n\n\n\n \n",

I'm finally starting to come around, but it's going to take some time. When I first arrived I was so scared that I slipped out of my original collar and ran right back into the back seat of my owner's car. I was brought to Lakeshore PAWS because my family was moving and couldn't take me with. I am house trained and crate trained. I'm really one of the sweetest girls. I'd prefer that my new home is calmer and has kids 10+ in it that are friendly and respectful. I want my new family to know that I will take time to adjust. I also am skittish, so they need to use caution while I adjust to my surroundings. I know a few tricks like sit, shake, down, and come. I enjoy sleeping in bed with you and cuddling at night. I haven't been around cats before, but my previous family said that I interacted just fine with other dogs. I'm quiet in my kennel for the most part. I sit on my bed and watch the world go on around me. My heart is broken, but I know another family can help me pick up the pieces and mend it back together. Once I warm up I'm a playful girl that enjoys treats and stuffed toys. I hope you give me the chance I've been waiting for to be with a family forever.\n\nLove, Kenzie",

Peanut is timid at first but LOVES LAPS & getting his ears stroked once he knows you.   Good with other small dogs in his foster home & good about going out.   Peanut just needs some time to adjust and know who you are.  Just remember that once you start giving him some attention, he doesn't want you to stop.  Pure sweetness!!\nBecause of Covid restrictions; we would like to stay within a 20 mile radius and it may take 3-5 days to receive our adoption application.",

I\u2019m a large girl weighing in at just over 70 pounds! I show interest in interacting with other dogs, although due to my size I might be too much for small dogs. I am a professional treat catcher. The staff has fun tossing treats in the air and I catch them. If you don\u2019t like dogs that drool... I\u2019m not your girl! I know how to sit so nicely and I can even stand up on my back legs for a few seconds while waiting patiently. When it comes to kids I would prefer that they are 8+. I am a very sweet girl, but sometimes I don\u2019t know my size. I have quite the bark when you don\u2019t pay attention to me. I just love to talk and tell you all kinds of things. My brindle fur is so beautiful. I can\u2019t wait to continue to receive all of the TLC Lakeshore PAWS has to offer, but I\u2019m excited to be in a home too. I\u2019m going to be spoiled. I just know it!\n\nLove, Venus",

I'd like to be the only pet in the home getting all of the treats and toys a girl could ever want. You'll be happy to know that I'm house trained and crate trained. You don't have to worry about me making a mess. Loud noises such as fireworks scare me. I've been tossing around some stuffed toys here at the adoption center and some of the volunteers have been running around with me outside. I am a chunky girl weighing in at 71 pounds. I need to lose some weight but it's hard because I just love food so much! I'd prefer that any kids in the home are 12+ because I am not a fan of a lot of chaos and I enjoy my space. My new family should be familiar with Hounds! We like to bark, play outside, and we enjoy our good. I seem to prefer being around men rather than women, but I interact just fine with females. I'm a social girl and I like to greet every one in the room. I sit nicely when asked. A senior girl like myself shouldn't be in a shelter. I should be in a home curled up on the couch, or maybe a dog bed by the fireplace. I can snooze while you'll cook or clean. I promise to be a good girl. I just need a family to promise to love me unconditionally and spoil me for the rest of my life!\n\nLove, Lilly Mae",

Bernard was picked up on a reservation where he had been an outside dog running with a number of other dogs; he had no real home. When he got to the county shelter he was considered almost feral, he had rarely been touched by humans. They worked with Bernard for weeks and he came around much faster than expected. We decided to bring him in with us to help continue his progress in a much more \u201chands-on\u201d environment. We\u2019re smaller and are able to give more individualized attention. Bernard is doing really well with us. He is learning to trust people and loves those that he\u2019s comfortable with! We\u2019ve found that if you take him for a long walk, he thinks you\u2019re his best friend. Bernard is very sweet, loving, and curious of all that life has to offer. He\u2019s looking for a calm home with understanding owners that will take their time to introduce him to new things. He\u2019d do best with another dog in the home, as it helps with his confidence. We know that, with love and patience, Bernard will grow into an amazing companion and his family will have his unconditional love and devotion. To have the opportunity to meet our sweet boy, please fill out an application today. \n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/91891552799173\n",

A nice lady brought me to Lakeshore PAWS and I\u2019ve been living a good life ever since. Now it\u2019s time for me to live my best life. You should know some important information about me. While I\u2019m not the biggest fan of other dogs, I was in a holiday foster home with kids and I was a good girl overall. I am well behaved in my crate at night if my family feels I need to be in one, but my foster mom thinks I\u2019d be okay without one. I get a little nippy and mouthy when I get bored and want to play, but I easily transition to a toy if given one. I am a little difficult to walk as I pull a lot and need some redirection. Treats and training will hopefully help with this. I\u2019m very sweet and I just love people. I was good and not over reactive to people coming over. I slept by my foster family\u2019s feet when they watched tv. I only got on the couch once, but otherwise I never got on the furniture even if I was invited. I\u2019m a little nutty in the car, but with more exposure and training I just know I will be the perfect girl. I can\u2019t wait to meet you!\n\nLove, Quinn",

Rex and Renny are two charming guys who have become orphans in their mature years.  Rex is a smiling Boxer mix who will turn 9 in March.  Renny is a lovable Golden Retriever mix who will turn 9 in June.  Both boys grew up together from puppyhood with a kind-hearted gentleman who loved them dearly. Sadly their owner died in November from Covid, leaving them to carry on by themselves.  The boys had the best care which included a senior support group so they are in very good health.  They have some arthritis to deal with but it does not stop them from enjoying a little wrestling now and then.  They are just a lot of fun.  Rex and Renny are two wonderful companions that are low maintenance.  They still enjoy doggie daycare once a week.  Rex and Renny are sweet old souls with so much more to give .....  each one is special in his own way.  They are happy to lounge around the house or soak up sun in the backyard. They don't require lots of walks.  Their hearts are longing to fill another home with the brightness and joy that has become part of them.  Contact us on how to meet Rex and Renny and give your heart away.",

            "description": "KEANU is a helping dog. He's playful with dogs, excellent with cats, and affectionate with humans. He's been helping a dog named Haley who was thrown from a building - he motivated her through her healing and is her best friend. He also became instant friends with a deaf dog named Daisy who's the same size and almost looks identical. He's welcoming to new puppies in the rescue as well. He has his own story to tell -- when he was a puppy, he was placed in a sealed box and left on the side of the road. He is a bit shy at first, especially with men, but his true nature, once he feels secure, is very playful and affectionate. \n\nHis adoption fee includes his neutering, vaccinations, microchip, and deworming. He was born on a reservation we work with in 2019.\n\nWe would love Keanu to adopt with Haley or Daisy if you don't already have a young playful female dog. \n\nWe have specific ADOPTION and COVID rules listed below.\n\nRevised adoption policy\nDue to Covid -19 pandemic and social distancing requirements, we've revised our adoption policy. \n\nFirst, please email (desertpawsnm@gmail.com) to inquire before you fill out the online application to see if the pet is still available. (Please do not call or text). We'll send you a link to the application.\n\nWe are unable to do multi-dog/cat meetgreets or adoption events at this time or bring multiple animals to your house to choose from, so please only inquire if you're serious about adopting this particular animal. If you're just shopping around with several shelters and rescues, please let us know this. \n\nIf your application is approved (which \"could\" take up to one week) then we will contact you to set up a Zoom chat or ph call to answer questions/clarify anything and set up a day/time to bring the pet to you. \n\nSince we can't come into the home/yard due to Covid-19, we ask that you send us pics /video of your home/yard/living area/current pets. \n\nWe will discuss with you about meeting your other pets. At the meeting/adoption at your house (outside) please wear a mask (as will we), keep to a properly distanced social distance and have hand sanitizer and your own leash.\n\nWe adopt locally to Central Abq, Santa Fe, Los Alamos and Rio Rancho. No out of area adoptions inquiries please. No young children for our adoptions please.\n\nThe animals are fostered and our foster families like to know their fosters are happy, healthy, and cared for during their lifetime. We appreciate staying in touch periodically (just a pic, holiday card, social media, pics/videos  etc will make our work worthwhile :-))\n\nOur volunteers and adoption board are working diligently with an overload of inquiries since Covid to match families and forever pets. Our workload on the reservations has also increased. We're sorry, but if you email us with questions that are already answered here or fill out an application that does not fit the parameters of our procedures we will not be able to reply to you. Thank you for your understanding on this!\n\nThank you - we look forward to hearing from you and having another furbaby united with a furever family!\n\n",

He is still slow to trust but is doing much better. Buddy has a very sweet and mild demeanor. He is pretty mellow overall. He is good with other dogs, kids and even cats! Once you earn his trust all he wants to do is kiss and cuddle! Buddy is a climber and can easily scale chain link or any kennel type fence. He will need a home with a 6ft privacy fence. He loves to be with his foster mom and follows her like a shadow. He is housebroken and is doing very well on his kennel training. Unfortunately, he is heartworm positive and will have to undergo treatments. His new family will need to be patient earning his trust while he adjusts to his new surroundings the first few weeks. Once he settles in and realizes he is loved you can expect a loyal, forever friend in Buddy! \n\nFor adoption please fill out an adoption application at www.spcaeasttx.com.",

I weigh about 91 pounds, but I need to lose a little bit of this quarantine weight I\u2019ve put on. Every one here loves me and they can\u2019t wait for me to find a home. A senior like myself deserves all the love in the world. I am very selective with other dogs, so it might be best if I was the only one. The staff doesn\u2019t know how I would do with cats. I can be strong on my leash when I want to sniff around and I smell something delicious or intriguing. When it comes to kids I\u2019d prefer that they are 8+. I have the sweetest eyes and they are begging for someone to love me. I don\u2019t like being here, but I am well behaved. I am looking for a home where I can snooze in peace and quiet and be spoiled with love. I\u2019ve waited my whole life for a family that will love me and keep me forever. 9 years is too long to wait. Help me find that forever home.\n\nLove, Big Mama",

She is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4498743.\n\nBillie Jean is a fun, energetic girl that has been at the shelter for over 60 days and it's time for her to go home! She loves to go for a walk and walks well on the leash once she gets away from the shelter. She loves to show you how much she likes you by leaning in for pets and jumping up to show you she wants to be petted. That's where Billie Jean needs to learn her manners and not jump. She knows \"sit\" for treats and takes them gently so she's a smart girl and she can be trained. Billie Jean would do well in a home with a yard so she can do the zoomies back and forth. But, she's also happy to have some down time and will crawl in your lap for some nap time. The shelter staff has recommended that she be the only dog in the home because she is reactive to other dogs when she sees them. She would probably not do well in a dog park. Because of her energy, she should go to a home with older children.\n\nIf you think Billie Jean could be the dog you've been looking for, please come and meet her today!! She would love to find a home soon.\n\nIf you are interested in saving this pet, please reach out via this link: https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/foster/BPAZ/Dog\n\nTo actually visit with this pup, please make an appointment here: https://mcaccappointments.as.me/adopt. NOTE: People who sign up for these appointments often no-show, and we have seen that you can generally show up and let them know you are there to meet this particular dog and the shelter will squeeze you in, except from 12-3PM or closer to the 6PM closing time. (Please know this is not a guarantee). If the dog is at risk, please ask for a supervisor to meet that particular dog.\n\n*Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG. MCACC is located at 2500 S. 27th Avenue, Phoenix. Different adoption fees/policy may apply. Please visit MCACC's website http://www.maricopa.gov/pets/locations.aspx for hours. You may also wish to call 602-506-7387 (PETS) and provide the animal's A# above to verify is still available.",

I don't need a fourth leg to keep up with and out run you, I'm great at it ?\n\nI'm wonderful with kids 2-20 and I haven't met any babies yet but my foster mom thinks I'd do just fine. I sleep in my kennel all night and I'm learning to walk on my leash really well! \nI can get a little noisy when I'm bored or I want you to pay attention to me, but a few pets and I'm calmed right down. I love other dogs and  want to play with all of them, but I do have a prey instinct so cats and small fluffy dogs might remind me too much of a rabbit. \n\nI'm learning to sit and lay with my sister pup and mom thinks I'll be very easy to train- she says I'm brilliant!\n\nI would be best in a home with a large fenced in yard where I can run to my hearts continent, and with a family who spends a lot of time either at home or places I can go too! If you would like to meet Sammy please fill out an application at\n\nwww.lowridersofthewest.org\n\nSammy\u2019s adoption fee is $375.00 - she is spayed, up to date on all his vaccinations and chipped.\n",

            "description": "To be considered for adopting a dog from Canine Lifeline, you must have an approved application must be on file. Please visit http://www.caninelifeline.org/adoption-process/ for more information about our adoption process and to submit an online application.\n\nMeet Jack, a very handsome and well-mannered 8 year-old Shepherd/Cattle Dog mix neutered male who was surrendered to a county dog shelter when his owner could no longer care for him. Apparently, his family now has a 6 month-old baby who was making Jack very nervous so they no longer wanted him in their home. Jack is a nice dog who is looking for a mature, quiet home without any young children so he can relax and enjoy his life. He walks very nicely on a leash for a big guy and knows some commands including sit and shake hands. He will shake with one paw and then give you the other when you ask for it! Jack isn't a fan of his crate so perhaps had never been crate-trained in the past but he does keep it clean so may be housetrained although we can't guarantee it. He would make a great companion for a retired person or couple who wants a dog who'll walk right into their house and make himself at home. Jack would love to have his humans around much of the time so his crate time would be minimal. Jack weighs about 66 pounds and his adoption fee is $200. He's neutered, heartworm negative and on monthly preventative, up to date on vaccinations including bivalent canine influenza, wormed, on flea and tick preventative, and microchipped. As part of the adoption process, all adopters must commit to a two-week adjustment period to make sure it's a great match before the adoption is finalized. Please email info@caninelifeline.org if you're interested in Jack. An approved application is required before we schedule meets with any of our dogs. Please note that we don't place our dogs in homes with children under 7 years of age. We correspond via email so please check your junkmail or spam folder to make sure our reply hasn't landed in there. Please visit our website at www.caninelifeline.org to see more photos of Jack and to submit an online application if you live in Northeast OH.",

Lizzy had been rescued from the shelter when she was 2 yrs old 8 lbs. Saving K9 Lives Plus was asked if we could help her.  We found out that Lizzy was 16 lbs and blind.   Her foster mom put Lizzy on a diet.  She lost 4 lbs, currently weighing around 12 lbs.  Lizzy has an appointment with the specialist at Eyecare for Animals.  Lizzy's foster mom discovered that Lizzy is defense around other dogs and is better in a home without another dog.  Lizzy is sweet and loving.  She wants to hang out with her person giving kisses. \n\nThank you to Second Chances for Blind Dogs for helping with Lizzy's medical.\n\nIf you are interested in Lizzy, please fill out an application on our website: www.savingk9livesplus.org.

She is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4522655.\n\nJillie is a young, beautiful girl that is at the shelter with her best friend Jenny (A4523835) and she doesn't know why she is there. She's so confused and scared. She won't walk on a leash but the kennel staff took her out to the play yard and she was cautious at first but when Jenny came out to the yard too, Jillie perked up and was very happy. You can tell that these two lived together and they love each other. Once they could see and play with each other, Jillie walked up to the staff person and play bowed and wanted to be petted.\n\nJenny and Jillie don't have to be adopted together, however, wouldn't it be a great ending to their story to find a home together? Because they are so timid, the shelter recommends that they go to a home with no children and the whole family should come and meet them before they are adopted. Can you give one or both of these pups a loving home? If you can, please come and meet them today!\n\nIf you are interested in saving this pet, please reach out via this link: https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/foster/BPAZ/Dog\n\nTo actually visit with this pup, please make an appointment here: https://mcaccappointments.as.me/adopt. NOTE: People who sign up for these appointments often no-show, and we have seen that you can generally show up and let them know you are there to meet this particular dog and the shelter will squeeze you in, except from 12-3PM or closer to the 6PM closing time. (Please know this is not a guarantee). If the dog is at risk, please ask for a supervisor to meet that particular dog.\n\n*Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG.

Meg has come a LONG way and is now ready to find her forever home. Meg will need a patient adopter, or a foster to adopt home. She is slow to trust, and will bark and/or growl when she meets new people but shows zero aggression. She's cat friendly but hasn't been around children and would probably do better with older children. She will need a confident dog in the home for her to play with and learn from. She also needs a fenced in yard. A must for her forever home is someone who allows pets on the furniture. The couch is her absolute favorite spot.\n\nMeg's adoption fee is $250. We require a home visit and vet reference.\n\nPlease fill out an application to start the approval process at www.LuckyPupRescueSC.com",

She is very high energy and would LOVE an active owner to take her on long walks or runs! She still has some puppy behaviors such as mouthiness and jumping, so she is looking for a patient, active owner willing to give her of training and stimulation. She can be vocal at times, so she would likely not do well in an apartment. \n\nOur big goofball Ella came to us from a shelter in Maryland in July of 2020. She was adopted out quickly, but once the adopter didn't have the time to train her, so she is now back with us. \n\nIf interested in adopting Ella, please submit an online adoption application! Due to COVID-19, all animal meetings must be scheduled by appointment. Once we receive and review your application, we will contact you to schedule an appointment. Thank you!",

Toby has not met a human he doesn\u2019t immediately love and enjoys anytime he can go on walks, runs and especially cuddle time. He is extremely intelligent and very eager to learn new things. Toby spent time with our dog training friends at Tug Dogs for a few weeks to refine his manners and work on his social skills. He will need someone who can provide continued training and follow the guidelines provided by his trainer. Toby has had some scary situations that have made him feel unsafe in the presence of other dogs so he must go to a home where he is the only pet. He is a very special boy and with continued training we know he will become the best version of himself. When he looks at you with those big brown eyes, you\u2019ll know how he feels about you. Come meet your new best friend!!\n\nIf you would like to learn more about Toby or learn how to set up an appointment to meet him, please email us at adoptions@hstt.org or call (530) 587-5948.\n\nToby is microchipped, neutered and current on vaccinations.\n\nHis adoption fee has been waived.",

Nor, can we say with any certainty what kind of mix he might be - perhaps hound and maybe shepherd? \n\nWe're estimating him to be between 3 and maybe five years old.  He really enjoys his time outdoors so would love a quieter home with active adults or perhaps one with older teens.   He really enjoys his walks and walks well on a leash. A perfect day for Buck would start with a long walk or maybe a run in the morning, followed by or perhaps before that a great breakfast, an afternoon nap, another good walk or time exploring his fenced yard, a good dinner and then a long snooze in front of the woodstove.  \n\nBuck can be a bit aloof when meeting new people and in fact, may be somewhat protective of those he considers family.  He probably prefers to be your only canine companion.  He's the kind of guy who strikes you as being wise waaay beyond his years when he looks at you with those deep brown eyes.  \n\nWhen Buck came to us he tested positive for heart worm and has subsequently undergone all the heart worm treatment.  Consequently, he's been with us for several months on strict crate rest while he recovered from the treatments. That was tough for  a big active guy.  He is now ready for the next adventure. and is waiting patiently for someone to share that with.",

            "description": "Hi, I'm Harrison! I'm a 2-year-old male Treeing Walker Coonhound mix who is searching for my forever family! It took me a little while to really settle in at my foster home but now I'm really letting my goofy and loving personality shine. I like to play with toys and kick all of my foster mom's couch cushions on the floor while I do it. I love to wrestle with my foster brother, he's a hound too, and when he doesn't feel like playing with me I bark right in his face. I love to look out the window and make sure everyone knows when any people or animals walk past. I'm working on my manners and walking on a leash without pulling. My foster mom says when I'm properly motivated, I pick things up really fast! I get along well with humans and dogs and have even lived with a cat, but I shouldn't live with young children. I'm a medium energy guy, I'm house trained, and I love to be involved in everything you're doing. Can we be best friends forever?\nYou can watch for stories, pictures and videos about me on our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/groups/40103261297/\n \nAdoption fee: $375.00\n \nAdoption fees for all dogs/puppies include a $50 refundable training deposit. Complete your basic training program and provide a copy of the certificate within 4 months (120 days) of adoption and we will refund $50 of the original adoption fee.\n \nAll dogs/puppies have been fully vetted including spay/neuter, micro-chipping, worming, heartworm testing and preventative treatment, flea/tick preventative, and all required age appropriate vaccinations. As required by Wisconsin Act 90, all dogs will have received a veterinarian exam (CVI) within the past 30 days.\n \nOur adoption process requires the submission of an application.

Yes, but that's ok; Opal has enough going for her to compensate for that quirk. If you are looking for an only pet to love forever, who also has a charmingly crooked nose, email humanesociety@hsscg.org and ask about Opal. We think she is a very subtle jewel.

He a tripod Vizsla mix who has been friendly with any dog or person he met. He will make someone a best friend and is low energy. \n\nHogan had not lived the life of a loved family member. He was untrusting of humans and human touch. He escaped from a small rural shelter, lived as a stray for over a month and during that time got hit by a car. His leg was mangled and infected. In addition, his spleen had a tumor on it and fluid surrounding his organs and some sort of obstruction. The injuries were severe and infection had set in. So much needed to be done and worry was whether he could make it through any surgery. After much debate, they went in...his spleen was removed, his leg amputated and they did exploratory surgery. He had a long road ahead of him but he made it!",

Unfortunately they had to surrender him because of a change in family circumstances that had nothing to do with him. He lived (and played) with his sister, and they got along great; she has been adopted and now Boston needs his home too. He also got along with cats outside. Our staff says he's sweet and enjoys going for walks. His owner called him a \"sweet protector\" because he's a good guard dog. He's playful and enjoys playing with dog toys; he likes to be petted on his beautiful, soft coat (not a fan of being hugged or having his head held).  He's kennel-trained and only rarely has accidents in the house. He also knows commands. Boston is accustomed to living in a loving home, and we'd love to get him back into one -- and you could make that happen! Please come meet beautiful Boston!",

I'm not big on toys I may move them around but don't really play with them. I will bark at new people or if you aren't passing attention to me, I'm an attention hog. I am crate trained and know sit, down, stay. I m a pretty girl and I'd love to be your best friend.\n\n*Daisy is not in the shelter*\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Daisy Mae, please call the PAWS program 720-404-9659\n\n*Adoption only*",

He is an 11 month old Border Collie possibly mixed with Lab because he loves the water!! He loves to run and play as much as he loves to curl up right next to you!!  He gets along well with other dogs and cats.  He is a little shy so would probably be better in a home with out young children as louder noises can scare him.  Jameson is going to need to go to a home that has time to work with him so he can grow his confidence.  We think he would do best in a home with a fenced yard and a family that enjoys the great outdoors as much as him.  His new family needs time to teach him tricks and learn how to be the perfect pet!!! If you think you would be a good fit for this handsome dude, please email us at LongJ1003@aol.com and Katybug6067@gmail.com!",

I really like cuddles, scritches and hugs, but also doing my own thing - sometimes I'll just nap in a different room or go to my crate for some alone time. Right now I still think breakfast should happen at 5 am, but I'll go back to sleep if you feed me and let me out! I get along with all the people I've met, but haven't met any kids. I got a little scared of a small dog, although eventually I walked within four feet of him! I did chase the resident cat once, but when I got scolded I didn't want to be anywhere near him, so we'll have to see if I ignore him now or if I'll get the courage to chase him again! I would rather not leave my safe, warm home right now, so I don't let us take very long walks and I'm much quicker when we turn towards home! Sometimes I try every path, in case it's the one to our house. I need a family that will help me build confidence and experience a lot of things!\n\nTo see other hounds currently in our care please visit the Hounds in Our Care page on our website.\n\nYou can also learn learn more about our adoption philosophy and find a link to our online application at our website: www.gpa-mn.org\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about adopting from GPA MN, please contact us at adoptioninfo@gpa-mn.org",

For the first hour after breakfast I like to be your shadow, so I can get pets first thing in the morning. Then I'll relax and lay a few feet away.

I will chill in my crate with the door open, and if it needs to be closed I'll whine a tiny bit but settle with a treat or reassurance. I like to investigate my surroundings and have recently realized that squeaky toys are the best! I'm rather shy of loud noises and fast movements, so I'm looking for a quiet home! I do pretty well with kids as long as they don't move too fast and scare me - otherwise I like their gentle pets. I have gotten surprised when someone enters the room suddenly, and so I bark at them! Otherwise I'm pretty quiet. I'm doing really well with my feline housemate, I listen really well to leave him alone and get treats when I do!\n\nTo see other hounds currently in our care please visit the Hounds in Our Care page on our website.\n\nYou can also learn learn more about our adoption philosophy and find a link to our online application at our website: www.gpa-mn.org\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about adopting from GPA MN, please contact us at adoptioninfo@gpa-mn.org",

My favorite thing to do is snuggle up in my bed and, although I'm not supposed to, the couch! What can I say, it's amazing! I am a little nervous, so I will need a family that is patient with me. Right now I am still very anxious in the car and in new places, and I had an accident at a friend's house because of my nerves. It's slowly getting better, as I get more confident. I have one sensitive foot, so for walks I wear boots, and even for quick potty breaks I wear a boot on one foot - it might look a bit silly, but I'm fine with it! I'm doing very well meeting new people, including some kids, and learning to leave my feline housemates alone. I do really well with praise and treats when I ignore them!\n\nTo see other hounds currently in our care please visit the Hounds in Our Care page on our website.\n\nYou can also learn learn more about our adoption philosophy and find a link to our online application at our website: www.gpa-mn.org\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about adopting from GPA MN, please contact us at adoptioninfo@gpa-mn.org",

I like going on walks, although my feet get cold quickly. I'm super eager to meet all the dogs and people we see outside! Ironically, I'm a bit shy when I finally get a chance to meet those new people. Loud noises still scare me, and I'm a little bit stubborn so it takes a little work to get me to move along, but eventually I do. I would rather not go outside even to potty by myself, and if I am alone I make it super quick! I currently live with a feline housemate, and I still think it's really fun to chase but I'm slowly learning. I have a little bit of a stubborn streak, but treats are helping. I do spend time in my kennel, but only with treats to lure me in and I still spend a little time whining about it!\n\n(Littermate to Justin)\n\nTo see other hounds currently in our care please visit the Hounds in Our Care page on our website.\n\nYou can also learn learn more about our adoption philosophy and find a link to our online application at our website: www.gpa-mn.org\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about adopting from GPA MN, please contact us at adoptioninfo@gpa-mn.org",

I'm tall and curious, so I'd really like to know what's on the counter, but luckily I listen very well and am easily persuaded that my nose doesn't need to be in the way. My foster mom says I'm easygoing and handsome! I whine a bit in my kennel, and would clearly prefer to sleep all the time on a dog bed, which could be because any kennel is a bit small for me. I really like food and being around people, especially my foster teenager! I'm well behaved in the house and on leash, although I would not do well with a feline family member. I could use some gentle obedience, because everything is so in reach for me!\n\n(Littermate to Scion)\n\nTo see other hounds currently in our care please visit the Hounds in Our Care page on our website.\n\nYou can also learn learn more about our adoption philosophy and find a link to our online application at our website: www.gpa-mn.org\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about adopting from GPA MN, please contact us at adoptioninfo@gpa-mn.org",

            "description": "DOB: 2/22/2014\n40lbs\n\nWe are currently accepting applications to adopt Newton. If you are interested in meeting and adopting him, please submit an adoption application by visiting our website (www.HarborOfHopeDogRescue.org). Due to COVID19 safety measures, meetings are currently only being scheduled with approved adopters.\n\nCute, affectionate, and WICKED smart..thats Newton in a nutshell! If dogs had IQ scores, Newton would be considered exceptionally gifted. He currently lives with 5 other dogs and does well with both male and female companions. Despite being a heeler, he isnt tremendously mouthy, so would do well with kids. \n\nThis boy does have a bit of a stubborn streak (he is part heeler afterall!), so he will need an owner who is committed to continuing his current training plan. This includes setting healthy boundaries, giving him plenty of mental exercise learning new commands and tricks and taking him for walks to work his brain and body. He does incredible on a leash and is not reactive to other people or dogs while out and about. If youre looking for an outstanding companion who will adore you and will always make life exciting, Newton may be the dog for you!\n\nAll of our dogs are fully vetted before adoption, including vaccinations, spay/neuter, and a microchip.\n\nThe adoption process consists of an online application, a vet reference, two personal references, and a home visit. If approved to adopt, there is an adoption contract and an adoption amount. The adoption amount for Newton is $300 and goes toward the vetting and care of all the dogs in our rescue.\n\nAll adoptions will take place in the Omaha NE area and must be done in person. We are willing to adopt to out-of-state applicants, contingent on our ability to complete a home visit, but you must be willing to come to the Omaha area to complete the adoption. We do not ship, transport or deliver our dogs.\n\nIf you would like to learn more about Harbor of Hope Dog Rescue, please visit our website (www.HarborOfHopeDogRescue.org) or our Facebook page. Thank you for your support!",

I was mainly an outdoor dog for most of my life, but this inside gig is sweet. I am energetic so don\u2019t look at my age and think I am low key. As far from low key I am as you can get. My heart is still in puppy mood (not sure if there is any other mood). I am very jumpy and learning more about manners currently. For this reason, I should only live with older children (8 and up.) I may do best without other dogs and would prefer I not live in an apartment as I am a confident boy who wants to protect his family and space. I\u2019m ready to bounce out of here!

He absolutely loves attention! He happily meets people and other dogs from what we have seen, and his favorite thing to do in the world is to have a ball thrown for him. Joey is skittish of thunder and was very confused about the ceiling fan here at the shelter. We think that he has never seen one before and did not know what to make of it! He knows lots of tricks too!\n\nCall the Salmon Animal Shelter to ask about Joey today!",

Now I need somebody to teach me how to be a good boy in my forever home. I have no manners yet, so I need a stern, consistent person to work with me. I am very food motivated! I'm 7 years old and I weigh 95 pounds. I could lose a few pounds, but I'm very fond of my food and treats. If you are the one for me . . . please help me have a new and better chapter in my life by adopting me into your home!\n\nNo need to call about me, but please do put in an application to adopt me here: https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/1369/generic . The online application form has a place for your questions and it is pretty easy to complete. The nice people here will review it, and give you a call with any questions. If you seem like a good fit, they will invite you out to meet me in person and decide if you'd like to take me home.",

            "description": "Sky, Pit Mix, 2 years, 53 lbs,\nThis sweet girl found her way to a rural shelter after someone in her family developed a bad allergy to dogs. We took her in and are determined to find her a new home! Sky is extra snuggly and super playful! She loves flopping on your lap and chewing on a toy. She gets along well with other dogs and follows all the play rules. This cutie is good in a crate and even hangs out in there when she\u2019s not asked to. She\u2019s also great with kids!\n\nSky is working on leash training (she is very strong) and learning how to respect people\u2019s personal space (she likes to lick faces and jump a bit). She needs a home without cats.\n\nSee more of her personality on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/skysofly614/\n\nRequirements for Adoption:\nSorry but we only place our dogs in the Columbus area.  For rescues/shelters across Ohio, visit:  ColumbusDogConnection.com/RescuesShelters.html\nMust be over the age of 24 to adopt.\nYour resident pets must be spayed/neutered.\n\nAdoption Process:\nWe do not have an application. Adoptions are pet-adopter driven.\nTo meet our pets:\nCall our office at 614-471-9000 or click on the pet which you are interested in and send email. We will be happy to discuss the adoption process with you and set-up a visit at time of contact. The foster dogs are in foster homes and most of the cats reside at our office.\n\nThe adoption process includes a lease manager reference (if applicable) , a veterinarian reference, a home-visit (in-person or virtual).\nIf you've never owned a pet, part of our adoption process requires that you call several vet offices to compare services, prices, and availability. \nQuestions to ask include:\nHow many doctors are at your practice?\nCan I request to see a specific Vet or would I be scheduled with first available?\nWhat are your hours?\nHow much is:   annual exam, heartworm test & tablets, an x-ray,  vaccines, a non-emergency office call? \nDo you recommend vaccines every year or every three years?  (every 3 yrs as suggested by the AVMA)           \n\nThe pooches that visit your home will not be left there at the end of the visit. We take them back home with us so your family can discuss to ensure he/she is a good fit for your home.\n\nThere is an adoption agreement and adoption fees as follows:\n $300 for Adult Dogs (6yrs  & younger)\n $200 for Senior Dogs (7 yrs and older)\n $80 for Cats  \n\n All pets are spayed/neutered, up-to-date on vaccinations, heartworm tested (dogs), fiv/leukemia tested (cats), & micro-chipped.\nKnown medical conditions are discussed at time of inquiry.",

            "description": "Hey all you Harry Potter Fansyou will be excited to know that Boston Buddies has our very own Alastor \"Mad Eye\" Moody. He came to us late last year from the Carson Shelter and got his name because of his little shrunken eye. We took him to the eye doctor who confirmed his little eye was not visual. He does see out of his other eye but there is some scar tissue from an old injury so he will continue to need lubricating eye drops to keep it feeling comfortable. Once this Wizard worked a little magic and lost some much needed weight he was ready for a full makeover. He had surgery to remove that little eye, the family jewels and a couple bad teeth and drank a magic potion (Panacur & Metronidazole) to rid him of any pesky parasites. Alastor is estimated to be 8 years old and currently weighs 27 lbs. Wish we knew more about his previous life because it seems that living with muggles is totally new for him. Any time he is faced with something he is unsure of he just \"freezes\". Maybe he thinks he is wearing a coat of invisibility? Or maybe he just thinks if he remains totally still no one will know he is there? You can't help but fall in love with this quirky guy. Leash walks are a work in progress. He uses the doggie door to go outside to potty but take him out the front door with a harness and leash to go on a walk and he digs his heels in and won't move an inch. Mr. Moody enjoys the company of other dogs and bootie scratches from his humans. He is great for baths and nail trims. Initially, Alastor would \"mark\" in the house but since being neutered that unattractive behavior has subsided. Alastor \"Mad Eye\" Moody is up to date on his vaccines, microchipped and ready to add a little magic to your life. If you want to make 2021 and beyond more mystical and incredible than you could ever imagine, you should fly on over to our website and complete an adoption application for Alastor Moody -\nhttps://www.bostonbuddies.org/adoption-application/\n\nAdoption Donation is $300.00\n\nView more pictures on our facebook page https://www.facebook.com/BostonBuddiesInc",

He is extremely affectionate and a very social animal. He wants to be near his people at all times - he will forfeit his position on the dog bed or couch just so he can lay by your feet. Don't let his age fool you - he gets very excited for walks or playtime and he is in great physical shape!\n\nBubba gets overwhelmed in busy environments so it is best if he goes to household without children as their hyperness and playfulness overwhelm him. He may never be a dog that can join you at a sporting event or festival but he will give you more love than you could ever ask for! He is totally fine with hanging back at the house and waiting for you. Bubba is good with dogs with the right introduction and lived with one in his foster home for 3 years!\n\nFor the right home, Bubba will be the perfect addition. If you would like to meet with him, be sure to go to our website, EHRDOGS.ORG, and submit an application! Don't forget to mention his name, BIG PAPI STEELE!",

You see my mom did something really bad. She has kids! All was great before, so now I am acting up as there are now TWO of them invading my peaceful home. I am a very lucky fellow as I had some great years, now it's gone. I need a get out of jail card now!!!\n\nAs you can see I am real cute and a great guy at 6 years old. I need a new home as an only dog. A single guy or gal would be grand as I like to protect my owners from interlopers. I am a big guy of unknown Westie mix gene pool and I weigh in at approx 40 lbs. Yep, That right, I am extra large so there is more to love.\n\nSunshine State Westie Rescue - Florida folks have told me that they will find a new home for me, which turned out to be the luckiest thing of all this mess. They promised to take really good care of me and pick out only the right home. I am with my original owners as my home gets lined up. So HURRY up and pick me!\n\nThe Westie Rescue-Florida lady wants to tell you some more stuff, but I can't wait to meet you and come live with you forever. XOXO, Charlei\n\n\nPlease take a few minutes and go to the website http://westierescue.com/. Take a look at the Frequently Asked Questions to familiarize yourself with all the factors affecting your decision to adopt a rescued westie like Charlei.<P> \nIf you think you could be the perfect forever home for a rescued Florida westie, please fill out and submit the Adoption Application. PLEASE MAKE CERTAIN TO FILL OUT EVERYTHING COMPLETELY. The incomplete applications are filed until someone has time to get back to them, which unfortunately, in an all volunteer organization, could take quite a while. <p>\nWhen your finished, send an email to: aggie.sswr@gmail.com to let her know you are interested in my big butt. She will smile and say \"Congrats\".<p>\n\nASK ABOUT CHARLEI (FLORIDA)",

            "description": "Benny is a 1-2 yr old Boxer mix, whom was found to have heartworms when he came to us. He has had treatment for the heartworms but will need to continue on monthly heartworm preventative for the rest of his life. He has been retested on 1/21/21 and that test was negative. Benny likes to give gentle kisses. He will stay next to his person without being called. Benny is mellow most of the time but will have bursts of energy. He pulls on a leash but with some basic obedience training, this could easily be resolved. Benny is food motivated. He knows the sit command. Benny is intensely interested in cats in a shelter atmosphere. Dogs are generally tested with dogs of their own size; and dog meets with the resident dogs are always encouraged. Our cat test should be used as a general purpose screening only to rule out overt aggression; we always recommend caution when introducing dogs to cats in the home. Recommendation on suitability of placement with children by their ages is based on behavioral observations including energy level and response to body handling. We never recommend leaving young children unsupervised with dogs, and we cannot guarantee the behavior of dogs with children, other pets or cats. Behavior evaluations should be considered as a snapshot of the behavior of the dog at this point in time; JHS believes all dog families need to be prepared to invest time and energy into training as well as provide common sense management of their new dog. We always encourage family to do some research on the breeds or mixes of breeds prior to adoption as many can have some unique characteristics that may or may not fit into their families. Always remember that the majority of dogs at our shelter have been exposed to or may have kennel cough. Kennel cough is contagious to other dogs, please talk to your vet if you have any questions about kennel cough prior to adoption. Please ask your adoption counselor at time of adoption if you have any unanswered questions regarding illnesses and treatments of the path that you are adopting. For more information about this dog or any others at our Shelter, please visit www.joplinhumane.org. We are the Joplin Humane Society in Joplin, Missouri. 417-623-3642",

Sadly, we are no longer able to respond to every application, but will contact the one that is a good match within 3 days.\nJacob is a male 15 lb chubby chihuahua, he is very chubby and should be closer to 12 lbs.   He was born 1/2012.   He is super sweet once he warms up to you, but is cautious for the first 10-15 min.  Probably not ideal with small children.   He is quiet and crate trained and good on the leash on a harness.  He likes other dogs and is very cute with the best colors and a cute face with blue eyes.   He does have a small \"cherry eye\" on one of his eyes, but since its not bothering him, has been there a very long time and is very small, we are opting not to put him through surgery.\nMost of our dogs are not available to an out of the area adoption because of difficulty to follow up.  If you do not live within a 2 hr drive of Orange County, please email us before applying to see if the dog you are interested is may be a candidate for long distance adoption.    We only make consider long distance adoptions for dogs who have been in our rescue for 6 plus months with no local candidates.\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our rescues, please visit our main website for adoption procedures at www.pupsandpals.net and then fill out our application.  Please note that we are all volunteers so it may take up to 3 days to process your application, but you will hear back from us if your application is a good match for the pet. \nWe do not have a shelter so individual appointments must be made to meet the pet you are interested in.  Our pets are fostered/boarded all over LA and Orange County.  \nThis pet is altered, vaccinated, microchipped, and has had a brief temperament evaluation to help us determine what type of  a home he/she would thrive in.  Please note that we put lots of time and effort to make sure our pets are ready to be someone's perfect pet before they go home.... and to make sure that we will have the best possible match for this pet we do require an : application, interview, adoption fee and in some case a home check.  \nListed for adoption: 1/12/2021\nAdoption fee: $300\nPLEASE DO NOT call or email to see if a pet is available.  We update our pages daily so if he/she is pictured here in the available dogs section, we are accepting applications at this time.",

He is very playful and happy, loves to play with the other dogs, and loves to be with his people.  He is in need of some training in manners and socializing.  He would love to go on walks/runs/hikes with anyone who would take him!\n\nBear is looking for a forever family to call his own. His adoption fee is $200, which includes  neuter surgery and vaccinations (parvo/distemper and rabies.) If you would like to meet this dog, please email us: scfourpaws@hotmail.com or leave a message @ 435-764-3534. Please be patient with us getting back to you as we are all volunteers with full-time jobs. Thanks for your interest in this wonderful dog!!",

            "description": "Hey, y\u2019all! My name is Dioja, but everyone calls me Hoss. I came to TIRR Rescue in late 2020.\n\nI have some separation anxiety, and my family wasn\u2019t quite sure how to handle it. I was my mom\u2019s constant shadow and panicked whenever she wasn\u2019t around. My parents finally decided it was best for everyone if they let TIRR Rescue find a home that was better able to handle me.\n\nI\u2019m a VERY sweet boy and I like just about everyone I meet. However, just like with my mom, I\u2019ll pick a person and stick to them like glue. If I can see them nearby, I\u2019ll cry and whine until I can get out and be right next to them. I have no idea just how big I am, and I can cause quite a bit of damage when I\u2019m panic, so it\u2019s important that I find a family who knows how to handle separation anxiety or is willing to keep me with them all the time. I would also do best in an active family; I like going for daily walks (or jogs)!\n\nIf you think you might be my forever family, be sure to contact my rescue people!\n\n~~~~\n\nPERSONALITY:\nDioja is a super sweet boy who has some separation anxiety. While he likes just about everyone he meets, he will pick one person and stick to them like glue. He tends to panic when he\u2019s not around them. He\u2019s a large, active boy who will need an active family that will keep him busy to help him with his anxiety. While Dioja\u2019s association with other animals is still under review, he is very much a ladies\u2019 man and loves cuddling and getting belly scratches.\n\n~~~~\n\nFor more information on Dioja, please visit tirrrescue.org/dioja.",

            "description": "Elsa is a lovely 3-year-old mixed-breed girl who currently weighs about 58 pounds. She came to SFAS when her guardian could no longer care for her. Here at the shelter, Elsa has been quite shy and unsure of new situations. Although she is very sweet she will need a quiet home to gain confidence at her own pace. She also may love to be the center of attention as she has been nervous around other dogs. If you have another dog at home, please bring them in for a meet n greet during your appointment. Elsa's adoption fee is $130. She is spayed and microchipped and has age-appropriate vaccinations. A licensing/microchip fee may apply. To meet Elsa or to be added to her waitlist, call (505) 983-4309 x 1610 and leave a voicemail message that includes the DOG'S NAME, plus YOUR NAME and A GOOD PHONE NUMBER - OR e-mail this information to adoption@sfhumanesociety.org. A scheduler will call you back within 48 hours to confirm your request. If you have other dogs at home, tell the scheduler you would like to bring them along for a Meet n' Greet. SFAS offers a variety of excellent training classes, seminars and Trainer Talks led by animal behavior professionals. These are $50 off for animals adopted from any shelter or rescue group! Due to current COVID-19 restrictions, classes and talks are all presented virtually using Zoom. For course descriptions, schedules and registration, visit https://sfhumanesociety.org/our-programs/behavior-training/group-training-classes/ for classes and https://sfhumanesociety.org/our-programs/behavior-training/special-seminars-and-workshops/ for seminars and Trainer Talks.",

            "description": "In Greek mythology, Apollo is the ultimate well-rounded man, the god of archery, music and dance, healing and diseases, truth and prophecy, the sun and light, poetry and more. Well our buddy Apollo is also incredibly well-rounded. Apollo is a sweet, handsome boy. He's easy to leash up and handle and takes treats gently. Apollo was found as a stray, but he spent time in a foster home where he was on his very best behavior. In his foster home, Apollo learned to be crate-trained, but he most enjoyed sleeping on the couch. He's housetrained and loves to play fetch with tennis balls or tug with a rope toy. His foster family tells us he was a good and friendly boy and the perfect houseguest, but they brought him back when they realized they didn't have enough time to spend with him. Apollo is a very good boy and he'd love to get out of the shelter and into a home. He would like to meet any resident dogs to make sure it's a good fit, and is looking for a home with no cats. If he sounds like your type of pup, make an appointment to meet him today. Ask Apollo's volunteer advocate, John, about him!: mclean.johnw@gmail.com APOLLO IS ENROLLED IN THE GOOD DOG PROJECT AT PACC - Read a message from his case manager here: tinyurl.com/gdpmessage - Ask his case manager about him: rachel.jones@pima.gov",

My life with AAP started after I was picked up as a pregnant stray with horrible skin and missing part of my tail. I don't like to admit that I was also a bit shy. I am much more comfortable in my skin these days (literally and figuratively) and am glad to be a proper house dog. It is amazing what some good food and a warm bed can do for a soul! And a bath, too. I'm not a big fan, but I will tolerate it. Something I will not tolerate, though, are cats. They get on my nerves! And if they run it is game on! I was a really good mom to my pups. I had a litter of 10! That's why my foster family calls me Big Mama. Don't let my size fool you, I have a big personality and lots of love to give. I know my puppies will be in good hands with AAP and will find great homes, but right now I am looking forward to finding a forever home for myself. Big Mama's adoption fee is $175. She is up to date on age appropriate vaccinations, spayed, and microchipped.\nAll of our dogs are spayed or neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccinations, microchipped and if over 6 months of age, heartworm tested and on heartworm preventative in their foster home.\n\nWe require an approved application to meet any of our dogs. We do not have a shelter location and will not arrange a meeting without an approved application.\n\nWe strive to make sure the bios provided for our dogs are complete and accurate; we do understand that mistakes happen, however, so if you absolutely cannot find the answer to your question in the dog's bio, you can contact us for more information.\n\nWe require a home visit for each dog we adopt out, so we adopt within a 2 hour radius of Dayton, OH.

Espi was in dire need of medical help.  She had numerous  large and infected mammary gland tumors, was skin and bones and terrified.  Espi under went major surgery and the vet not only removed the large tumors that lined her belly, we also learned that her uterus was stretched and torn beyond recognition.   It has been nearly four months since this gal has been in our care and we feel it is time for Espi to continue her journey.  Espi will need to find a  loving, understanding family that has a quiet routine so she can continue to gain confidence.  Espi does enjoy the company of other dogs and we feel she can learn from them.  Mostly, she still needs time to warm up to people and settle into a routine that will allow her to trust.  Espi is currently with her foster family and is becoming quite the couch potato.  She increasingly enjoys human touch and loves to be in the company of humans.   It is the quick movements, loud noises that will startle her. We think Espi will do great with a family that has kids, other animals but also allows her time to continue to heal.  A consistent routine will benefit Espi.  She will no doubt make a sweet, sweet companion.  We estimate Espi to be about three years old, she is slight dog, about 40lbs.  She is very sweet and has paid her dues.  She deserves to be spoiled every single day she is on this earth.  If you are interested in giving Esperanza the best home in the world, please take a moment to fill out an application: https://www.povertyspets.org/adoption-form .  You will be contacted within 48-72 hours.  $200 adoption donation.",

Please visit http://www.caninelifeline.org/adoption-process/ for more information about our adoption process and to submit an online application.\n\nDorian is a handsome 2 year-old Black Lab mix who's short, stocky, and a solid 57 pounds. He was found as a stray and taken to an overcrowded county dog shelter. When he wasn't claimed there, he made the trip to Canine Lifeline so he could take his time finding the perfect new home. Dorian seems to enjoy meeting new people and has done well with everyone he's met since coming to us. He has also been fine with female dogs but has been a little growly with other males. That is likely to tone down now that he's neutered. Overall, he's a gentle boy who walks quite nicely on a leash, has excellent crate manners, and may be housetrained too although we can't guarantee that. Dorian is happy to have a tennis ball to play with so might be a good fetcher with a little more practice. He was very well-mannered when his photos were taken and was interested in the squeaky toys we used to get his attention. Dorian is very food-motivated and eager to please so it should be a pleasure to work with him on obedience training. His adoption fee is $350. He's neutered, heartworm negative and on monthly preventative, up to date on vaccinations including bivalent canine influenza, wormed, on flea and tick preventative, and microchipped. As part of the adoption process, all adopters must commit to a two-week adjustment period to make sure it's a great match before the adoption is finalized. Please email info@caninelifeline.org if you're interested in Dorian. An approved application is required before we schedule meets with any of our dogs. Please note that we don't place our dogs in homes with children under 7 years of age. We correspond via email so please check your junkmail or spam folder to make sure our reply hasn't landed in there. Please visit our website at www.caninelifeline.org to see more photos of Dorian and to submit an online application if you live in Northeast OH.",

She was wonderful with all the humans in the house but was miss bossy pants with the other dog. The goal in life for a Great Pyrenees is to protect livestock, children, people, grass, flowers. lawn furniture, bird feeders, the moon, and any other real or imaginary predators that may intrude on your personal space,  She is about 1 year 3 months old and has been spayed, fully vaccinate, blood tested and microchipped. \n\nShe is affectionate, but not needy.\nShe is a huge alarm barker! If she hears something, she barks, a lot!\nShe is fearful of strangers but warms up after 10-15 minutes.\nWhen she is worried, she get close by your side. She is insecure.\nShe is super playful.\nShe knows paw and sit.\nShe doesn't seem to be a fan of cats.\nShe is very dog selective.\n\nLunas ideal home should be:\nA house and NOT an apartment. Apartment living for Petunia may not be ideal because of her barking.\nExperience and an understanding of working dogs is required. Luna needs a job and will need a large amount of exercise not only for her body, but for her brain.\nOlder kids (8+), because the young ones may just be\ntoo scary for her and she can be like a bull in a china shop.\nEnrolling her in obedience classes IS REQUIRED for adoption. Proof of enrollment is required. Training not only will this help forge a lasting bond with Luna, it will help her to be a better pet.\n\nIf you fit the bill and think you would be a great pet parent for Luna, please let us know. Showings are by appointment only, due to COVID. We are sending adoption applications to interested people. If your application is approved, we schedule a meet and greet appointment.\nIn the message box of your inquiry for Luna, please put to the attention of Adoption Counselor. \n\nHer adoption fee is $165.00",

            "description": "Lucky came to us when he was hanging out in the middle of a busy road; just laying there. The lady did not want to see him get run over, or injured, so she loaded him up and a Deputy met her here to impound him. No one has claimed him. \nHe has had quite the life and the battle scars to prove it. He has seen his share of fights- his face is scarred, and his back foot has found a snare or something similar to it in the past. He has a healed scarred back foot that does not bother him \nHe is true to his breed, he is not good with other dogs. We tried a foster with him because their dog was so sweet and gentle. We have added his foster mom's comments below. \nHe will need a truly escape proof fence as he has been allowed free rein in his past life and he looks for ways to escape.\nHere at Paws, he is absolutely no trouble. He is house trained, sleeps on his nice comfy bed, doesn't bark and is genuinely a sweet guy. \n\nLucky was very calm and gentle while he was here, but he was quick when he wanted to escape. He seems to get too hot indoors, but is house trained and did let us know when he wanted out and did not chew on anything in the house. \nIf a door is even cracked a little he will push through, and he does not come back when his name is called or other common recall commands, but he definitely does know his name and would *sometimes* come when called if we called him in an excited tone. He seems to actively search for an escape route and did appear to be afraid he was in trouble for running off, because he would whine and roll over as soon as I got out of the car to bring him back. He's such a sweet, gentle giant who loves head pats. He loves duck treats, but didn't show interest in any of the toys I got for him. He just loves exploring. He was good with my dog because she left him alone when he made it clear he wanted space. \nYou were right, he just has some special needs, the main one being a yard he can't escape at all, or he will take off down the road. He is just a sweetheart! Thank you for all you do for these sweet animals!!\n\nIf you feel you can help this guy, we would love for you to come and meet him!",

As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals or how large puppies will be when fully grown.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our 'Visit' page for hours and directions to our shelter.

You see my mom did something really bad.  She has kids!  All was great before, so now I am acting up as there are now TWO of them invading my peaceful home. I am a very lucky fellow as I had some great years, now it's gone.<P>  I need a get out of jail card now!!!\n\nAs you can see I am real cute and a great guy at 6 years old.  I need a new home as an only dog. A single guy or gal would be grand as I like to protect my owners from interlopers. I am a big guy of unknown Westie mix gene pool and I weigh in at approx 40 lbs. Yep,  That right, I am extra large so there is more to love.<P>\n\nSunshine State Westie Rescue - Florida folks have told me that they will find a new home for me, which turned out to be the luckiest thing of all this mess.  They promised to take really good care of me and pick out only the right home. I am with my original owners as my home gets lined up. So HURRY up and pick me! <P>\n\nThe Westie Rescue-Florida lady wants to tell you some more stuff, but I can't wait to meet you and come live with you forever.  XOXO, Charlei<p>\n\nPlease take a few minutes and go to the website http://westierescue.com/.     Take a look at the Frequently Asked Questions to familiarize yourself with all the factors affecting your decision to adopt a rescued westie like Charlei.  If you think you could be the perfect forever home for a rescued Florida westie, please fill out and submit the Adoption Application.  PLEASE MAKE CERTAIN TO FILL OUT EVERYTHING COMPLETELY.   The incomplete applications are filed until someone has time to get back to them, which unfortunately, in an all volunteer organization, could take quite a while.  When your finished, send an email to: aggie.sswr@gmail.com to let her know you are interested in my big butt.  She will smile and say \"Congrats\".\n",

I can be shy at first but a few treats help me move past my nervousness pretty quickly. I would prefer to go to a home with adults and children over the age of 15. Once I'm comfortable I love toys, belly rubs and more treats! I'm not quite comfortable with other dogs at the moment, but I may become more comfortable as time goes on. I've not been tested with cats. My ideal home includes regular walks, lots of belly rubs, occasional adventures and lots of treats. If you'd like to meet me, please submit an application and a Dog Adoption Counselor will contact you to schedule a meet and greet! You can also call to get more information at 530-343-7917 x 201.",

This gentle giant is housebroken and loves affection from his human. TJ enjoys romantic strolls - he's great on a leash (side note: he even knows how to stroll on a treadmill!). For dinner he'll treat you to his favorite meal of little smokies and string cheese, and after dinner, he'd love nothing more than to snuggle up in bed and watch your favorite rom-com. Adopt TJ today and get yourself a furever man. \n\nTJ is about 6 years old and weighs about 88 pounds.\n\nIf you're interested in meeting TJ, please visit our website to learn about our adoption process and to fill out an application, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs and cats will be micro-chipped, spayed or neutered, and up-to-date on vaccinations at the time of adoption. For more photos of TJ, follow us on Facebook Gateway Pet Guardians and Instagram @gatewaypets ... #gpgTJ. \n\nTo view other adoptable pets from our shelter, please visit, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nGateway Pet Guardians is proud to offer a variety of mixed breed dogs available for adoption. However, please keep in mind that we rarely know the genetic background of the animals we rescue and, as such, we cannot guarantee the exact breed combinations found within this dog. However, we do not know his/her actual genetic makeup. Just know that this dog is probably a variety of several different breeds that have combined to create one very amazing and unique animal.",

            "description": "\nSamson was born in October of 2016 and came into rescue because he nipped two people when they came into his wireless fenced yard area.  This is not uncommon for this breed, as they protect everything within their area. He was also in a wireless fenced area, which is one of the many reasons why wireless fencing does not work for this breed.  He is a friendly and outgoing boy, who enjoys human attention, and who does well with other dogs.  He was previously with chickens in the past, and does not harm them.  He is unproven with cats.  He is a fence jumper, and will need a 5' - 6' fenced area.  He was a house dog the past few years, and also spent time outside too.  If you have free range chickens, and a structure for shelter, not a lean to or dog house, and a 5-6' fence, Samson could be the boy for you.   To apply for him, send a message to info@igpr.org to receive a livestock guardian application. \n\n We recommend obedience training for all newly adopted pyrs, to help you create a special bond with you and your new friend, and so you have a well behaved canine. Great Pyrenees are willing to learn, but are not as eager to comply with commands as much as other breeds. They are bred to be independent thinkers. Applicants must be over 25, own their own home and all children in household must be over 6 years old. Your resident pets must be up to date on vaccines, sterilized, you must have a good history of vet care for them, and you must have used heartworm preventative year round for your dogs. \n\n\nSamson can be placed as a livestock guardian, but he will need a structure, not a lean to, or dog house for shelter.  You must have  5'-6' fenced area. \n He can also be placed as an inside pet with outside privileges. You MUST have a securely fenced 5'- 6' fenced yard accessible from your home. Invisible fencing does not work with this breed and they will take the shock for the freedom, or bite anyone who enters their territory.  Great Pyrenees are bred to roam and will create their own territory if not secured, which can led to them being lost, hit by vehicles or shot by people who see them as a threat. The breed is not a good off leash dog, and cannot be trusted to not run away.  A Great Pyrenees off leash is a \" DisAPyr.\" \n\nIf you are interested in adopting or fostering, please complete the appropriate application on our website, www.igpr.org under the Adopt tab. \n\nAll of our dogs marked as needing foster homes are also available for adoption.  If a dog is listed on this site, it is available.  No need to contact us to see if it is,  We do require you  complete the adoption application prior to meeting a dog.\n\nWe also offer a foster to adopt program. You foster the dog, and have first right of refusal on them if an approved application is submitted for them. \n\nIn fostering a dog, the dog comes to you fully vetted. and groomed. You provide good quality food, grooming, and we provide the heartworm preventative and medical care, if needed* .(*Based on approval from IGPR.)\n\nAdoption fee is $300",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.ADOPTION PENDING!! I am so very thrilled for my sweet little lady Amy that she met her parents last night. It was a 100% love-fest all the way around. She was nervous at first, sure it's so confusing for all these dogs seeing all these new people wearing masks, but after they took their time, sat on the floor with her, fed her small pieces of meatballs -- she was able to be sure they only wanted to love her.\nHer Mom & Dad are even going to get a new fence installed for her safety & enjoyment so it will be a while before that can happen but she is 'Going Home' to be the beloved baby girl & start her new life. She's even going to be living nearby here in DE so I'll get to see her & babysit as needed. She will be my #565th adoption since 2-24-2004! Amy's 'Meet Your Match' designation is Teacher's Pet - I've got the whole package - smart, four legs, love to learn, and live to please. Go ahead, teach me anything. Sit, stay, balance your checkbook, I can do it all. Keep me entertained, and I'll be yours forever. **Be sure to look at Amy's videos & photos below**\nI'm Amy's foster mom & she is a pure delight! She's very smart, so much so that you can see her thinking & most of all she wants to please. She also seems to love -- love -- love kids which here at LNF makes her a 'Bona-Fide Kid Lover!' She was introduced to several little girls from 8-10 years old & she just wiggled all over with joy & rolled over to give everyone 'belly' at meeting them! She actually does lots of wiggling -- she is a true wiggle-butt!\nNO KITTIES! I feed birds & squirrels, so I have many of them out front on my lawn. When she comes back from a leash-training session, she really wants to chase them!\nShe's truly such a good young lady, and very sweet & friendly & generally comes when I call for her. I would say about 90% of the time. She has had extensive professional training & as stated before, she really wants to please you & tries to figure out what you want from her.\nShe's just turned 1-year old & she still has lots of puppy in her behavior. She's petite at only 35 lbs. I don't have children, so I have not been able to test her but given her gentle disposition, I'm sure she'll love kids as much as people -- but she will need to be tested with kids to be sure.\nYou can see how shiny her coat & very short & very soft! She's housebroken & she goes to the backdoor to let you know to let her out to potty. Amy does not want to potty in the house!\nHere is a photo of her on my sofa with her girlfriend Reese. She has earned the right to be in my home & on my sofa. She loves other dogs, but given her youth, she can get rough & sometimes she has to be corrected -- which she accepts.\nShe would love to be adopted into a home with another dog, but it should be with another young playful dog like her -- so they can be buddies. An older, more mature dog would not enjoy her always wanting to play.\nWhat she adores, most of all, are sticks - I put a photo of her in when she is happiest - when she has found \"a stick!\" When she's out on a training walk or in my fenced-in yard, she's always on a mission to find them. She's such a fun-loving, playful baby girl! The other thing she LOVES is water! When I bring the hose out to clean & fill up the water bowls she loves to play in the water. (There is a video of her showing her joy) & she loves ice as much as water. She stomps on ice & throws chunks up in the air with complete abandon!\nIf she sounds like the kind of young girl you would like to bring into your life & home, be sure to read our adoption requirements first & if you can meet or exceed them, you can apply online. Both are listed on the left side of our website.\nWe accept or credit cards & PayPal for the adoption fee.\n~ All LnF pups/dogs have been temperament tested & live in a foster home. ~ All pups and dogs have been housebroken (puppies are paper trained) & crate-trained and have had basic training ~ All pups/dogs have been Microchipped ~ Tested for Heartworm, Ehrlichia & Lyme ~ Each dog is on Heartworm Medication & Flea/Tick year-round while in our care ~ Up to date with Rabies ~ Distemper, Parvo & Leptospirosis vaccines ~ de-wormed.\nOur adoption fee includes (30) days of FREE pet insurance with an option to purchase -- but there is no obligation. We strive to provide the BEST medical care available so that YOU are assured all our pups/dogs are healthy, up-to-date on all necessary shots, spayed, or neutered by our rescue.\n\nClick here to watch a video of Amy/ADOPTION PENDING!!. 1/26/21 9:55 AM",

I'm ready.....come and get me!\n\nI'm a sweet pup, but I was never neutered so my family turned me into the county shelter because I \"humped\" a lot.  Being approx. 10 years old I should have been neutered unless I was used for breeding.  I'm a good looking fellow so that's a possibility.  Anyway I'm getting neutered.  My teeth are awful.  My first vet check found 2 teeth just hanging with a thread.  The vet removed them and I feel much better.  I'm o.k. with other pups and I'm sure I'd be fine with cats, but not sure.  I'm a gentle little soul.  My foster moms biggest complaint is I'm not potty trained completely.  I go outside, but sometimes I hike my leg.  Not good, but I know I can get better.  I could have been an outside pup.  I do love being inside, so I say I'm an inside pup.  I'll soon be ready for my forever home.",

            "description": "This gorgeous fluff ball is our very sweet Pickles! A few months shy of her birthday, Pickles' biggest wish is to be able to celebrate it with her own furever family. Pickles is believed to be a purebred Pyr, she only came to us because her previous owners had their own health issues to tackle with and were unable to adequately care for Pickles. These days, Pickles has settled in wonderfully in her foster home, and is an exceptional playmate with her foster siblings. Pickles has this superb ability to win you over in a few seconds with her puppy charm - she is adorably sweet, and absolutely LOVES being hugged or brushed. She is happily playful, just as a young dog her age should be, and will happily show you her invented games so you can be involved as well :) Pickles still has a lot to learn, but she is a fast learner and always eager to please, making training sessions a fun and rewarding experience for her and her people. Pickles would love to have a family who has the time to help with her training and guide her along as she adjusts to new environments; in time, Pickles will no doubt mature into the pyrfect companion who will bring you years of joy. Now, who wants to grant Pickles her wish in time for her birthday?\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nView full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed. \n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

Needs a strong handler who will work with him. Great boy. Good with kids.\n\nTOTAL FEES FOR ADOPTION:   Adoption Fee of $275 + Texas Sales tax of 8.25%  + $150 transport fee for a total due of $447.69. The adoption fee includes all age appropriate vaccinations (spay/neuter, microchip, health certificate) and the transport fee covers transport to the Pacific Northwest on the next available date).\n\nTRANSPORT: Currently we have monthly transports. It will be up to the adoptive family to meet the transport to pick up your new family member. Please be advised that our dogs are adopted to their forever families prior to being transported to the Pacific Northwest. Unfortunately at this time, we cannot bring dogs for a typical meet and greet situation, due to the extensiveness of the transport distance and it being unfair for the dogs who are not adopted to have to make the trip back. \n\nDue to the number of requests that we receive on our puppies and dogs, please be advised that all adoption applications are processed in the order received.

Needs a strong handler who will work with him. Great boy. Good with kids.\n\nTOTAL FEES FOR ADOPTION:   Adoption Fee of $275 + Texas Sales tax of 8.25%  + $150 transport fee for a total due of $447.69. The adoption fee includes all age appropriate vaccinations (spay/neuter, microchip, health certificate) and the transport fee covers transport to the Pacific Northwest on the next available date).\n\nTRANSPORT: Currently we have monthly transports. It will be up to the adoptive family to meet the transport to pick up your new family member. Please be advised that our dogs are adopted to their forever families prior to being transported to the Pacific Northwest. Unfortunately at this time, we cannot bring dogs for a typical meet and greet situation, due to the extensiveness of the transport distance and it being unfair for the dogs who are not adopted to have to make the trip back. \n\nDue to the number of requests that we receive on our puppies and dogs, please be advised that all adoption applications are processed in the order received. Once we send you an application, your place in line does not get reserved until your application is returned to us.",

A good Samaritan brought her to Loving All Animals,  fed and groomed her and she is thriving! Marzipan weighs about 17 lbs. and is approximately 6-7 years old. This girl would make a wonderful companion pet. She is NOT leash trained and this could possibly due to the fact that she was possibly tied up most of her life. If you are interested in this precious girl please call Loving All Animals @ 760-834-7000",

Needs a strong handler who will work with him. Great boy. Good with kids.\n\nTOTAL FEES FOR ADOPTION:   Adoption Fee of $275 + Texas Sales tax of 8.25%  + $150 transport fee for a total due of $447.69. The adoption fee includes all age appropriate vaccinations (spay/neuter, microchip, health certificate) and the transport fee covers transport to the Pacific Northwest on the next available date).\n\nTRANSPORT: Currently we have monthly transports. It will be up to the adoptive family to meet the transport to pick up your new family member. Please be advised that our dogs are adopted to their forever families prior to being transported to the Pacific Northwest. Unfortunately at this time, we cannot bring dogs for a typical meet and greet situation, due to the extensiveness of the transport distance and it being unfair for the dogs who are not adopted to have to make the trip back. \n\nDue to the number of requests that we receive on our puppies and dogs, please be advised that all adoption applications are processed in the order received. Once we send you an application, your place in line does not get reserved until your application is returned to us.",

Needs a strong handler who will work with him. Great boy. Good with kids.\n\nTOTAL FEES FOR ADOPTION:   Adoption Fee of $275 + Texas Sales tax of 8.25%  + $150 transport fee for a total due of $447.69. The adoption fee includes all age appropriate vaccinations (spay/neuter, microchip, health certificate) and the transport fee covers transport to the Pacific Northwest on the next available date).\n\nTRANSPORT: Currently we have monthly transports. It will be up to the adoptive family to meet the transport to pick up your new family member. Please be advised that our dogs are adopted to their forever families prior to being transported to the Pacific Northwest. Unfortunately at this time, we cannot bring dogs for a typical meet and greet situation, due to the extensiveness of the transport distance and it being unfair for the dogs who are not adopted to have to make the trip back. \n\nDue to the number of requests that we receive on our puppies and dogs, please be advised that all adoption applications are processed in the order received. Once we send you an application, your place in line does not get reserved until your application is returned to us.",

I was living on the streets in Houston for a while until I came to live with my foster mom. When I got here I had bad eye and ear infections, and although I didn't fully trust her, I let my foster mom treat my infections and was never sassy to her. She says I don't have a mean bone in my body. Since my infections got all cleared up, it's been determined that I don't see or hear to well anymore, so it takes me a bit to warm up. I'm housetrained, but when I get to your home I ask that you please don't give me full access to the house right away, at least until I know my surroundings a bit. This will help me to learn where I need to go to get outside to go potty. I get along with other gods of all sizes, who are calm and can show me the ropes of my new home. I'd actually really love another dog around, but if you don't have one that's okay, I have confidence that you, as my new family, will help me learn my way around my new environment! I'm a bit curious about cats, but I'm not mean to them, and I don't chase them. I would do okay with older kids too. I just need them to understand my seeing and hearing issues, so no little ones please. \n\nSince I was living on the streets, I'm having a good time learning how to be a dog in a home environment, and playing is one of the things I'm learning. I have a sister dog here that plays with the humans, and I try to watch her and follow her lead. Since I don't see too well, I will sometimes take your hand in my mouth, but I never do this to bite or hurt you, I'm just not sure how to play yet, so please don't be scared, but instead help me learn. I walk really close to my people so I know where to go, and this makes me feel more comfortable. Sometimes I will mouth your shoes while we walk, but with time and training, I'm certain I won't do this for long. I really like going places with my humans once I know I can trust them, but the act of riding in the car isn't my favorite activity. I sure hope I find a family soon, who is willing to help me be a dog and work with me to build a bond that is unbreakable! Maybe that's you?\n\nAlbert's Dog Lounge is a transporting dog rescue, meaning that we rescue many of our dogs from high kill shelters in areas of dog overpopulation. We are a specialty rescue focusing primarily on senior and special needs dogs.  The vast majority of our dogs come from the Houston, TX area where we have an entire team of volunteers, coordinators, and fosters. We do also work with local shelters, rescues, and owners.  If you apply for a dog that is currently in our local Houston program, we will work to get your dog transported to WI as quickly as possible. We ask that you have patience during this time of uncertainty and unprecedented dog adoptions nationwide. \n\nLearn more about Albert's Dog Lounge, our mission, and adoption policies by visiting Albertsdoglounge.org. \n\nOur process includes an approved application, reference checks, a homevisit, and then a meet and greet with the dog. Adoption fee is $275.\n\nBegin your application process by copying this link into your web browser: https://www.albertsdoglounge.org/apply\n\nWI Dept. Of Agriculture License Number: 474085-DS",

            "description": "Georgia is a 2 yo female Husky/Terrier mix weighing approx. 40 lbs rescued from a North Carolina Shelter.\n\nGeorgia is a gorgeous husky mix who is looking for a furever home. She had a rough start to life and ended up in a high kill shelter in North Carolina. Due to her rough past, she needs patience and someone who is willing to teach her the world and things aren't scary. She is so smart and currently has already mastered \"Sit\" \"Stay\" \"Kennel\" \"Timeout\" and \"Get out\". She loves playing with her dog foster brother Roscoe and they do everything together. She does need slow introductions to other dogs and would do best in a home with a submissive dog her size or larger. She will require a 6 foot fence or an owner who will never leave her outside unattended due to her husky instincts to look for things to keep her busy lol. She would be an amazing candidate for training and LOVES to impress you. She has learned so much and has come so far in her short time at her foster home, she would truly make an excellent addition to anyone's family. She is kennel and potty trained and LOVES her kennel.\n\n** NO Cats or small animals for Georgia\n\nIf you would like to meet Georgia please complete an online application that can be found at: http://hopeanimalrescueofiowa.org/forms/196/dog-application\n\nAdoption fee is $250 which includes spay/neuter, age-appropriate vaccines/tests, and microchip.",

Bandit would need a home without children under 13, Male dogs, and no cats.

Bandit has been neutered, vaccinated and micro chipped. Large and in charge Bandit would love to be your one and only and help him gain confidence in this world that is new and scary for him.

He is a lover of all people and would love a home  that will keep him as part of the family (walk/play) and also allow him to snuggle up with you in the evening. He would be best with a family with older children and breed experience.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Terrin, please complete an application and then reach out to roxy@bigfluffydogs.com\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please apply online, at https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/. \n\nOur main website, www.bigfluffydogs.com has more information about us and the rescue process. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters should understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. Homes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for 1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (i.e. a 4-month-old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break). 2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise. 3.) Socialization.  The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home. 4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded ten-fold, for years to come.  Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy.  Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time-consuming and can be expensive. All dogs require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well-socialized dog is more than worth the effort to get them there.",

            "description": "Hi my name is Inka. I\u2019m 4 years old and 47 lbs. I came all the way from Puerto Rico to find my furever family. So far, here\u2019s what the volunteers at ODHS have to say about me:  \n\nWhen Inka arrived he had a lot of pent up energy and quite frankly, he needed to be neutered!  Since that has happened, wow, he has really mellowed out. He\u2019s now so sweet, curious (but not obnoxious), and much more gentle. He walks pretty well on his leash (and that gets better everyday too). He plays nicely with other dogs. He crates well too. He\u2019s a handsome fellow with a great personality.  He will be a wonderful dog for his furever family. Below, is information from his Puerto Rico foster: \n\nInka is a very intelligent boy. He likes to be the alpha male and has alot of pent up energy that he needs to get out. Inka is very sweet but also very sensitive. He doesn't like to be yelled at and he doesn't like to be handled roughly ( like for medical things or \"helped\" into a crate). He has been through alot and needs an understanding family.\n\nYou can still come adopt me or even join our foster program to help the humans learn all the awesome things about new dogs like me! Learn more on our website! \n\nHope to see you soon! \n\nWhat breed am I? Mixed mutt! ODHS does not breed label (unless there\u2019s official paperwork), as studies show it is nearly impossible to tell the exact breed of each dog based off of their appearance.\n\nEducational article:\n3/3/3 rule:\nhttps://www.rescuedogs101.com/bringing-new-dog-home-3-3-3-rule/?fbclid=IwAR2iv5m7fqk3FieO7LOsstGeGsYYV_F1rJOd1BPxaImofLpcinpYsUbFRWs\n\nAdoption Donations are $250 for an adult, $350 for puppies (a dog under one year of age), and $125 for a senior dog (based on the age of the dog). Adoption donations are to be made via cash, and credit/debit card. There is a $5 fee to run cards.\n\nPlease remember to bring a collar and leash (non-retractable) with you the day of the adoption. Note: Martingale collars and slip leads are strongly recommended.\n\nDue to COVID19, we aren't having as many open, public adoption events.  Current schedule is pre-determined meet and greet appointments are Wednesday evenings and on Saturday from 12-2.  \n Our adoption center is located at 3602 Lafayette Blvd, Suite 102, Fredericksburg, VA 22408. It's important that you keep an eye on your emails for any changes or updates during the adoption process.\n\nVisit our website for an application to adopt. \nhttps://www.olddominionhumanesociety.org/adoption-application\n\nOld Dominion Humane Society is a volunteer based organization. We are run completely by volunteers, who also have full time jobs, so we appreciate your patience.  Currently, the average timeframe for a response to your application is 1 week.\n\nLike us on Facebook \"Old Dominion Humane Society\"\nand be a part of promoting forever homes for dogs in need.\n#Adopt #Donate #Foster #Volunteer \n\nNote: ODHS only adopts to Virginia and surrounding states (including D.C.). A $50 out of state fee applies.",

Koa's a good boy...suuuuuuuch a good boy!! This pup will do best in a home of his own where he can get a lot of activity and attention. He loves people and especially getting belly and ear rubs. He walks great on leash and does very well in the car, so will be a joy to hike with! He knows 'sit', 'down', and is very receptive to voice, even coming when called. This polite boy will also give you his paw for a shake! With all that intelligence there has to be a little malamute mischief and here it is...he can open doors! So typical of his breed, he will need a secure space and activity so he doesn't get bored and decide to take himself for a walk. That challenge is easily overcome by ensuring he is exercised and engaged - which will be super easy with his personality - I mean who wouldn't want to pay him all the attention? As one of our volunteers aptly put it, Koa is 'ready to hop up on his forever couch soon'!Interested in sponsoring? See our sponsorship information.",

            "description": "Tall, dark & handsome young man seeks adoptive family that loves outdoor activity and adventures \u2013 running, urban mushing, hiking, camping and more with at least one other large-breed, playful canine companion. I love playing with other dogs and they help give me confidence to explore the world. \n\u00a0\nChildren confuse me and give me anxiety. No children; teenagers would probably be ok. I am very weary and very scared to meet new people or be in loud & busy places. My adoptive family will need to have experience with fearful dogs and a lot of patience.\n\u00a0\nI do have house manners but I absolutely need consistency, boundaries and continuous training. I go urban mushing 3-4 times a week, in addition to daily walks, multiple but short training sessions throughout the day and love playing with puzzle feeders every day.\n\u00a0\nApplication Requirements:\n6 foot fence or higher. 10 foot fences with lean-ins are not required but advantageous.\nPrevious German Shepherd, Belgian Malinois or Siberian Husky ownership & training experience is required.\nGeographic exclusions apply, e.g. applications may be rejected simply based on home location. Home location must be within 5 hours driving distance from the greater Los Angeles area. \nAt least one other large-breed, active canine companion is required.\nNo children; households with teenagers may be considered.\nInterview & home visit are required.\n\u00a0\nJack will be 1 year old in February. He is a German Shepherd/Malamute mix with a sprinkling of Siberian husky, Samoyed and other breeds. He is currently 80 pounds and will likely be 100+ pounds when fully developed. He is neutered, microchipped and current on vaccines.",

I am learning my leash manners but really I just want a big ole yard to run and play in. I am very sweet and cuddly too!!  But so far, the only friends I\u2019ve wanted to cuddle with are my human friends. I most likely need to be the only dog in your family.,\n\nI just arrived to ODHS but the humans promised to update my bio as they learn more about me! I traveled all the way from Puerto Rico to find my furever family! I'm what you call a street dog, the product of little to no spay/neuter in my area. \n\nYou can still come adopt me or even join our foster program to help the humans learn all the awesome things about new dogs like me! Learn more on our website! \n\nHope to see you soon! \n\nWhat breed am I? Mixed mutt! ODHS does not breed label (unless there\u2019s official paperwork), as studies show it is nearly impossible to tell the exact breed of each dog based off of their appearance.\n\nEducational article:\n3/3/3 rule:\nhttps://www.rescuedogs101.com/bringing-new-dog-home-3-3-3-rule/?fbclid=IwAR2iv5m7fqk3FieO7LOsstGeGsYYV_F1rJOd1BPxaImofLpcinpYsUbFRWs\n\nAdoption Donations are $250 for an adult, $350 for puppies (a dog under one year of age), and $125 for a senior dog (based on the age of the dog). Adoption donations are to be made via cash, and credit/debit card. There is a $5 fee to run cards.\n\nPlease remember to bring a collar and leash (non-retractable) with you the day of the adoption. Note: Martingale collars and slip leads are strongly recommended.\n\nDue to COVID19, we aren't having as many open, public adoption events.  Current schedule is pre-determined meet and greet appointments are Wednesday evenings and on Saturday from 12-2.  \n Our adoption center is located at 3602 Lafayette Blvd, Suite 102, Fredericksburg, VA 22408. It's important that you keep an eye on your emails for any changes or updates during the adoption process.\n\nVisit our website for an application to adopt. \nhttps://www.olddominionhumanesociety.org/adoption-application\n\nOld Dominion Humane Society is a volunteer based organization. We are run completely by volunteers, who also have full time jobs, so we appreciate your patience.  Currently, the average timeframe for a response to your application is 1 week.\n\nLike us on Facebook \"Old Dominion Humane Society\"\nand be a part of promoting forever homes for dogs in need.\n#Adopt #Donate #Foster #Volunteer \n\nNote: ODHS only adopts to Virginia and surrounding states (including D.C.). A $50 out of state fee applies.",

PLEASE READ ENTIRE BIO BEFORE EMAILING****\n\n*Name: Faith \n*Age: 10-11 years \n*Current Weight: 99lbs \n\n*Rescued from: \n*Adoption fee: $250\n*Health: up to date on required vaccines requires daily meds and supplements  for arthritis \n\nFaith is a super sweet old lady that loves to relax on a comfy bed, or lay out enjoying the sun! She is house trained, never chews and stays out in the house alone. She likes other dogs but she has a hard time getting around sometimes due to her arthritis, and would do best with a calm dog. She likes to go for short walks, and does great in the car (just needs a little help getting in!) She is a 99 lbs Rottweiler mix, and is about 10-11 years old (maybe older). She has osteoarthritis and takes Gabapentin and Rimadyl to help her get up and down, and around easier. When she is feeling good, she is a very happy girl and loves human attention! She is truly a sweet heart, and deserves to live out her golden years in a relaxing, loving home! \nFaith  was rescued when she was near death in a rural shelter in Texas; an area where there is an abundance of homeless dogs, and not a lot of shelter space for them to go while they wait for their forever homes. Faith had contracted a bad case of pneumonia and she was fighting her life when we rescued her! She pulled through like a champ and deserves a second chance. To apply to adopt Fairh fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. \n**Meet and greets will not be scheduled without an approved application.**\n\nIMPORTANT: This dog has not yet been altered. For any dog or puppy that is not able to be spayed/neutered prior to adoption, SNARR requires a $125 deposit in addition to your adoption fee, as well as a strictly-enforced signed Spay/Neuter Contract stating you will have this dog altered within 6 months of adoption. The $125 deposit will be returned once the contract has been fulfilled. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n-------------------------------------------------------\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $375 for adults. Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n\n\n",

I am great at entertaining myself to I will play all day if I could. I would love a fun family to take me to see all kinds of new things in life! I also ride great in the car so we can go wherever you want. \n\nI just arrived to ODHS but the humans promised to update my bio as they learn more about me! I traveled all the way from Puerto Rico to find my furever family! I'm what you call a street dog, the product of little to no spay/neuter in my area. \n\nYou can still come adopt me or even join our foster program to help the humans learn all the awesome things about new dogs like me! Learn more on our website! \n\nHope to see you soon! \n\nWhat breed am I? Mixed mutt! ODHS does not breed label (unless there\u2019s official paperwork), as studies show it is nearly impossible to tell the exact breed of each dog based off of their appearance.\n\nEducational article:\n3/3/3 rule:\nhttps://www.rescuedogs101.com/bringing-new-dog-home-3-3-3-rule/?fbclid=IwAR2iv5m7fqk3FieO7LOsstGeGsYYV_F1rJOd1BPxaImofLpcinpYsUbFRWs\n\nAdoption Donations are $250 for an adult, $350 for puppies (a dog under one year of age), and $125 for a senior dog (based on the age of the dog). Adoption donations are to be made via cash, and credit/debit card. There is a $5 fee to run cards.\n\nPlease remember to bring a collar and leash (non-retractable) with you the day of the adoption. Note: Martingale collars and slip leads are strongly recommended.\n\nDue to COVID19, we aren't having as many open, public adoption events.  Current schedule is pre-determined meet and greet appointments are Wednesday evenings and on Saturday from 12-2.  \n Our adoption center is located at 3602 Lafayette Blvd, Suite 102, Fredericksburg, VA 22408. It's important that you keep an eye on your emails for any changes or updates during the adoption process.\n\nVisit our website for an application to adopt. \nhttps://www.olddominionhumanesociety.org/adoption-application\n\nOld Dominion Humane Society is a volunteer based organization. We are run completely by volunteers, who also have full time jobs, so we appreciate your patience.  Currently, the average timeframe for a response to your application is 1 week.\n\nLike us on Facebook \"Old Dominion Humane Society\"\nand be a part of promoting forever homes for dogs in need.\n#Adopt #Donate #Foster #Volunteer \n\nNote: ODHS only adopts to Virginia and surrounding states (including D.C.). A $50 out of state fee applies.",

He was at the veterinarian on 1/26 and it is believed that it is cosmetic as of now, but will likely need to be removed in the next six months to a year.\n\nChad had a fun afternoon snacking on yummy cookies and a duck foot from Dog Krazy.  I think his favorite part was napping in the car. He's a very sweet calm puppy who enjoys kids, snuggles, and giving kisses. He does seem a little nervous when outside.  I also believe that he tries to wait until he's outside to do his business.\n\nI traveled all the way from Puerto Rico to find my furever family! I'm what you call a street dog, the product of little to no spay/neuter in my area. \n\nAs a puppy, I am required to go to training within 90 days of my adoption with a professional trainer. Paws and Heels is recommended.\n\nHope to see you soon! \n\nWhat breed am I? Mixed mutt! ODHS does not breed label (unless there\u2019s official paperwork), as studies show it is nearly impossible to tell the exact breed of each dog based off of their appearance.\n\nEducational article:\n3/3/3 rule:\nhttps://www.rescuedogs101.com/bringing-new-dog-home-3-3-3-rule/?fbclid=IwAR2iv5m7fqk3FieO7LOsstGeGsYYV_F1rJOd1BPxaImofLpcinpYsUbFRWs\n\nAdoption Donations are $250 for an adult, $350 for puppies (a dog under one year of age), and $125 for a senior dog (based on the age of the dog). Adoption donations are to be made via cash, and credit/debit card. There is a $5 fee to run cards.\n\nPlease remember to bring a collar and leash (non-retractable) with you the day of the adoption. Note: Martingale collars and slip leads are strongly recommended.\n\nDue to COVID19, we aren't having as many open, public adoption events.  Current schedule is pre-determined meet and greet appointments are Wednesday evenings and on Saturdays.\nOur adoption center is located at 3602 Lafayette Blvd, Suite 102, Fredericksburg, VA 22408. It's important that you keep an eye on your emails for any changes or updates during the adoption process.\n\nVisit our website for an application to adopt. \nhttps://www.olddominionhumanesociety.org/adoption-application\n\nOld Dominion Humane Society is a volunteer based organization. We are run completely by volunteers, who also have full time jobs, so we appreciate your patience.  Currently, the average timeframe for a response to your application is 1 week.\n\nLike us on Facebook \"Old Dominion Humane Society\"\nand be a part of promoting forever homes for dogs in need.\n#Adopt #Donate #Foster #Volunteer \n\nNote: ODHS only adopts to Virginia and surrounding states (including D.C.).

            "description": "Adopt or foster Lucy today !!! This lovable girl is waiting patiently for her forever home. Lucy is approx 6 years old and weighs about 50lbs. She Is a very easy going girl who would do great with another dog as a playmate. She really likes to play with other dogs. She is great with kids and gives very gentle kisses whenever she gets the chance. Lucy is crate trained/potty trained and can be in her crate for hours without whining or complaining. Lucy pulls a bit on leash but only because she loves going on walks so much. She would do best in a home with no cats as she is not cat friendly. Lucy was found abandoned on the side of a country road, along with 3 other dogs in Houston. When Lucy was found she was very thin and found to have heart worm disease.  Lucy has since completed her heartworm treatment and is ready for her forever home! It is very important that Lucy stays on monthly Heartworm preventative. \nLucy will be arriving into NY from Texas on 1/23. \nTo apply to foster or adopt  Lucy please visit www.snarr northeast.org",

The home he lived in suffered from domestic violence causing Amos to have some stranger danger issues. He\u2019s young. Around 3 years old. He plays well with most other nice dogs. Amos is smart and learns quickly. His benefactors from Sonoma paid to have Amos trained by Renee so he is undergoing boot camp training. His eventual adopters will be eligible for two private lessons with him so you will be getting a well trained dog. The private lessons will train you to be a good dog handler. Amos probably needs a home with just adults. Come meet this handsome dog!",

Although he has had a difficult life up until recently (he used to live with a homeless person who had to give him up), you would never know it from his personality.\n\nThere is one word that best describes Harley: Sweet sweet sweet. Harley is the sweetest dog his foster mom has ever cared for (and that is saying something!). He is a big baby that loves to be on your lap and just chill on the couch. Harley\u2019s tail never stops wagging! He can also be very active; he loves to play fetch. \n\nHarley is well behaved.  He walks well on a leash. He can sit, stay, give paw, lay down and come. He has no food aggression with his own food and does not bother people when they are eating.\n\nIf you would like to adopt Harley (and we sure hope you do!), please reach out to Safe Paws Rescue and they will send you an application to begin the adoption process. Safe Paws is a small rescue, so they accept inquiries from residents in Pinellas County only, please.\n\n",

He has a seroma on the left side of his penis from the procedure.\n\nThis gorgeous red coat boy is a sweet lap dog. He does seem to prefer men.\n\nLil Bit has been working on potty training and has learned to use Pee Pads. He would do best with an owner who has a fenced area and would be able to let him out frequently for potty breaks.\n\nLil Bit likes to have a quiet snooze by himself, but would like for his owner to be home more often that not.\n\n*Lil Bit will only use a step in harness. He does not like a harness or collar put over his head.\n\nLil Bit is blind in his right eye and is missing some teeth. He is looking for a patient adopter that will let him have his nap while they watch over him.",

PLEASE READ ENTIRE BIO BEFORE EMAILING****\n\n*Name: Titan and Jasper \n*Age: 1 year and 3 years \n*Current Weight: 125lbs and 65lbs \n*Rescued from: South Carolina \n*Adoption fee: $750  (plus $125 spay/neuter deposit each, which is refundable when spay/neuter agreement is fulfilled)\n*Health: Both are up to date on required vaccines, microchipped, neutered. Jasper is heartworm+ (SNARR covering treatment)\n\nTitan is a pure bred Great Dane and Jasper is a Shepherd Lab mix. This adorable pair are best buddies and need to be adopted together :-) They were found running loose and when animal control was made aware of who their owner was and checked their living conditions, they seized the dogs. Jasper and Titan lived in a tiny outdoor pen which was very dirty and unkept. Despite where they came from, these boys are super friendly and social and very good boys! They both tested well with other dogs too. Titan is Heartworm negative and will need to be adopted with a neuter contract. Jasper is HW positive and the rescue will provide his medication for whoever adopts him. These boys deserve a great home where they can stay together and be spoiled and loved!  \n\nTitan and Jasper are currently waiting for their forever home at SNARR's Adoption Center in Brewster, NY. They arrived in NY on 1/16 and quickly became a favorite pair among SNARR\u2019s volunteers! To apply to adopt or foster this awesome duo, please fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. \n**Meet and greets will not be scheduled without an approved application.**\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n-------------------------------------------------------\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $375 for adults. Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n\n\n",

            "description": "Meet Gertie! Gertie is a shy, petite, pittie lady, 50lbs, around 3yrs old, fully vetted and HW Negative. She loves people but is a bit weary of anything new. Her Favorite thing is to cuddle, she is very gentle and would make a great companion. She tolerates other animals (dogs and cats) and likes to play outdoors, indoors she wants nothing more than a couch and you. She walks very well on a leash and enjoys any time she gets to spend with you. She does well in a crate, she still has her meals there, but has progressed to sleeping on a dog bed in the bedroom. She is potty trained, unless it's cold outside then she will use a puppy pad. She hates cold and humid weather, and refuses to be exposed to it. She is soft spoken, she very rarely barks. However, she will occasionally grunt or sigh. Gertie has done well around children, but will do best is a calm environment as she's still gaining confidence and is easily startled. She is very sweet and appreciative. I think Gertie will adapt to almost anything as long as she is properly introduced and given time. She has obviously had a rough go in life and deserves to have warmth and love for the rest of her life. Can you open your home and share your couch with this sweetie?\n\nTo set up a meet and greet or inquire about a dog, please first fill out an application at https://savinghoperescue.org/contact.

            "description": "Meet Noah, the spunky and incredibly sweet chihuahua mix. Noah came to Real Good Dog Rescue as a stray, and the vet suspects he is approximately one year old! Noah loves to play fetch, have some zoomies and then cuddle up in your lap for a well-deserved snooze and snuggle. Noah loves to chew on his bones, play with his teddy, and toss around his other toys. Noah can walk on a leash (he loves the park!), ride in your car, and go in a sling. Noah has mastered potty training #1 but struggles with #2 when it is cold (typical chihuahua mix!). He needs a coat/sweater when he goes outside, and luckily, he loves soft cozy items. He has learned sit and is working on down. We just get too excited for treats! He loves tummy rubs like nobody\u2019s business and loves treats. Noah is the sweetest boy with a heart of gold. Noah is heartworm positive and has started his preventative medication. His adoption fee is $200\n\n\n\nAfter reading this pet's info, if you are still interested in adopting, please fill out the online adoption application found at www.realgooddogrescue.com \n\nThe ideal home for this Real Good Dog will have a secure fenced yard.  A solid history of excellent vet care for current or previous pets is required.  Preference will be given to applicants who have specific breed experience.  \n\nPlease visit www.realgooddogrescue.com to submit an electronic application if you are interested in adopting this or any other Real Good Dog.",

I had an ulcerated paw, which really hurt and my choke chain collar was way to tight and had started to imbed in my neck. The people here give we medications and I am all healed up. My fur will take a while to grow back on my neck were it was shaved. My tail was never bobbed so I do have a long tail. I know Rotties normally have a bobbed tail so I am special cause I do not! I am approx. 1 year to 2 years but very puppy like. I am a big love bug. I would like to be on your lap! OK at approx. 99lbs that is a lot of lap dog I know but still. Snuggles then. I love to play ball. Run the yard and have a blast!!! Who knew life could be this fun! I am a strong boy and I am a hand full on leash but working on that. I know how to sit and give paw. So I am a smart boy and good learner. As for other dogs I would say maybe a girl friend would be OK but NO male dogs! I have to check out the cats too. I can let you know later how that goes. As for little people. I think if they are nice and have manners with a dog I could like little people especially if they will play ball with me! So I am hoping to find a active fun loving family. We will all have a great life together and have lots of fun!\n\nBoone met Ned the cat. He had to be encouraged to check him out. He barked at him once which startled us all but that was it. For the most part he had no interest. Ned seemed comfortable. I would suggest a highly monitored case as running loose is not the same as crated! Cat runs he could decide to chase.",

            "description": "COURTESY LISTING--- INFORMATION AND CONTACT IS LISTED BELOW. \n\nMy name is Val and I'm an approximately 5 year old pit bull, lab mix. I had a rough start to life being neglected and abused by humans only to be dumped at the shelter. I had suffered a broken ankle and hip which had been left untreated and had skin infections and was underweight. I laid shaking in the back of my kennel too scared of what would happen to me next when a dedicated volunteer took special notice of me and got a team of dog lovers and rescue organizations to get me out. \n\nI was lucky enough to find my way to a trainer who helped me learn how to trust again, build my confidence, and teach me how to be a good house dog. My trainer fell in love with me and decided to keep me but sadly medical issues force her to find another loving home for me. Maybe you're who I'm looking for!\n\nWhat You'll Love About Me: I am such a sweet (and sensitive) young man. I absolutely love snuggling and giving kisses. I will do anything for a tasty treat and I will chase a ball but have no idea that I should bring it back to you! I am absolutely adorable launching into the pool to make splashes that I chase and can keep myself entertained doing this for quite some time. \n\nI am potty trained, rarely bark, know how to rest quietly in my crate, never guard food or toys from people, and am not stressed if my humans are gone. I'm very polite while driving in the car and I love a good nap and also chewing on a nice bone.\n\nWhat I Need in a Home: Because of my past, I can be a little shy (especially with strange men) so I'm looking for a home without big parties or lots of visiting strangers....I'm not aggressive, just a little unsure. I don't have a lot of experience around young kids so it's probably best I don't live with them either.\n\nI'm more of a home body and am not the kind of dog who would enjoy going to busy spaces. So a house with a quiet neighborhood to walk in or just a nice yard for me to get my wiggles out in is perfect.\n\nI can also be dog selective (I like some dogs once I've gotten the chance to know them) but my trainer thinks it's best I am the only dog in my home just to make sure I'll feel safe. I have previously met cats and did fine with them and I can be retested around kitties if needed. \n\nAdopting Me: If I sound like a good fit for your home and you're dedicated to helping continue my journey in trusting humans and believing the world is a safe and wonderful place, please get in touch with Erin at Tug Dogs by emailing: tugdogacres@gmail.com or call/text 916-426-6469. I am currently living in the Sacramento area. A home inspection will be required to adopt me (may be done virtually due to Covid) and transition/training support will be provided.",

            "description": "Hi friends. I'm Lily, aka Mama Lily, aka Lily Pad . Like many of those before me, I'm from Texas, with a heart just as big. Love hard and snuggle harder, that's my motto. My life BB (Before BUR) was a sketchy one, one I'm trying to forget. I also had heartworm and missed a transport while I recovered, but was able to come up last Oct. My life AB has been pretty good. I'm still learning to trust, I love everyone I meet when I'm given the chance, and I even have a new puppy friend. We take walks together, AND I have booties for when it's snowy. Don't really know about kiddos and other critters, since my foster mama doesn't have any of those. \n Living inside is a new experience. Really made a place for myself in the big, comfy chair. I get to sleep there all night too. I don't really like being home alone but foster mama always comes home so I'm getting used to it. I just love to snuggle, and take walks, they're my favorite things in this new life. That's all I'm really looking for...\n Well, my doggy doctor says I'm ready to go, so if you think you would like to add me to your family, please send in your application. See you soon!! Apply on our website: www.buffalounderdogs.com\n\n \n\n*our adoption radius is with 45 minutes of zip code 14226, US only.",

For more photos of Cherry, follow us on Facebook Gateway Pet Guardians and Instagram @gatewaypets ... #gpgCherry. \n\nTo view other adoptable pets from our shelter, please visit, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nGateway Pet Guardians is proud to offer a variety of mixed breed dogs available for adoption. However, please keep in mind that we rarely know the genetic background of the animals we rescue and, as such, we cannot guarantee the exact breed combinations found within this dog. However, we do not know his/her actual genetic makeup. Just know that this dog is probably a variety of several different breeds that have combined to create one very amazing and unique animal.",

She's just as sweet as those marshmallows on top, loving to get cuddles and pets from her humans. Justine also loves the company of a confident dog to learn from, and even cats too. She's housebroken, crate trained, and is a dream on a leash. Adopt Justine today and get yourself a sweet treat without the calories.\n\nJustine is about 3 years old and weighs about 45 lbs.\n\nIf you're interested in meeting Justine, please visit our website to learn about our adoption process and to fill out an application, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs and cats will be micro-chipped, spayed or neutered, and up-to-date on vaccinations at the time of adoption. For more photos of Justine, follow us on Facebook Gateway Pet Guardians and Instagram @gatewaypets ... #gpgJustine. \n\nTo view other adoptable pets from our shelter, please visit, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nGateway Pet Guardians is proud to offer a variety of mixed breed dogs available for adoption. However, please keep in mind that we rarely know the genetic background of the animals we rescue and, as such, we cannot guarantee the exact breed combinations found within this dog. However, we do not know his/her actual genetic makeup. Just know that this dog is probably a variety of several different breeds that have combined to create one very amazing and unique animal.",

However, please keep in mind that we rarely know the genetic background of the animals we rescue and, as such, we cannot guarantee the exact breed combinations found within this dog. However, we do not know his/her actual genetic makeup. Just know that this dog is probably a variety of several different breeds that have combined to create one very amazing and unique animal.",

Winter is fantastic with other dogs and really wants to play with the cats. She is fully vetted and ready for her new home.

As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals or how large puppies will be when fully grown.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our 'Visit' page for hours and directions to our shelter. We look forward to seeing you soon!\n\nLink to the Adoption Application: \nhttps://www.animalhouseshelter.com/adopt/adoption-application/\n\nAnimal House Shelter\n13005 Ernesti Road\nHuntley, IL 60142\n\n847-961-5541 phone\n847-961-5537 fax\n\nOpen:\n\nSunday-Friday from 11 AM to 7 PM\nSaturday from 9 AM to 7 PM\n\nConnect With Us:\n\nLike Us On Facebook\u00a0!\nWatch Us On YouTube\u00a0!\nFollow Us On Twitter\u00a0!\n\nAdoption Application:\u00a0https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/adopt/adoption-application/\n\nAdopt a Pet:\u00a0https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/adopt/\n\nDirections to Shelter:\u00a0https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/visit/\n\nAdoptable Dogs:\u00a0https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/dogs/\n\nAdoptable Cats:\u00a0https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/cats/\n",

To set up a meet, an application must be submitted.**\n\nFinley will be 10 months old on the 15th, and around 45 pounds. Her mom is a Shepherd/Husky mix, not sure what dad was, but she definitely has shepherd/husky characteristics and looks. \n\nShe will need an adopter that is experienced with the breed. While she is a sweet girl, and wants to listen and obey, she will continue to need training and work and does have some of the Husky anxiety they are known for. She will need a fenced in yard, but hasn\u2019t shown any interest in jumping her fosters 4\u2019 fence. She is awesome with other dogs of all sizes, but will need a cat free home. She will do best with kids 12 and over, as she is still young and working on controlling her impulses. She is house broken. She is available for foster to adopt if you are local to the Fredericksburg area. If interested in meeting or adopting Finley, please submit the adoption application on our website. pp2crescue.com \n\n\n\n",

He is so sweet and lovable, and just wants a person or family to love and lean on.  He will need patience and understanding in housetraining and leash walking, but he is very eager to please.  He will require a fenced yard or leash walking; he can\u2019t be let loose, as he will put his nose to the ground and take off.  He seems good with other dogs, and okay in the car.  He is quite stressed right now, being away from the only home he has ever known, but once introduced, he is anxious to become your best friend.  Rowdy is a special guy with lots of love to give!\n\nRowdy has been dewormed, microchipped, tested for heartworm and is on preventive, neutered, and has received the Distemper-Parvo combination vaccine, Kennel Cough vaccine and Rabies vaccine.  \n\nFor more information, please call the Bedford Humane Society at 540-586-6100, or go to www.bhsva.org/adoptions-home.htm to fill out an adoption application.  \n",

He's an interesting dog in that he loves some people at first site and others not so much so introducing him to strangers can be a little difficult. He would do best in a home with low traffic where he can get to know and trust the people coming through his territory. Watson is strong minded and needs a dog savy person. He likes to sit on your lap and is very affectionate but he doesn't care to be smothered in any way or have people in his face. He likes to play with ropes and chewy toys and sits like a perfect gentleman in the car. This boy is looking for someone to bond with who understands him. He'll be your loyal companion for life if you're the one for him.\nWatson is guessed to be 6 years old and weighs approximately 70 lbs. For an appointment to meet him, please email adoptions@satchelslastresort.org or call 941-924-5070.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Mama Martina is a stunning 7 lb brindle chihuahua who they estimated at approximately 1-2 years old. She came into rescue with two beautiful babies. The babies are ready to find their new homes and Martina is too!!\n\nMartina is the epitome of a chihuahua! She is a Velcro dog and is literally glued to your lap. She had no sense of personal space and loves her people with all she has. She is friendly to strangers but she does bark at anyone entering the home initially. She has been around an 8 year old child and has done fine. As well as cats. She lives with other dogs and tolerated them but her true love is of her people.\n\nMartina does know what to do when taken outside but in true small dog fashion she will also sneak and pee on occasion especially when it's cold or rainy. She does have pee pads available to her in her foster home. She has been on a leash a few times but will need more work on this in her forever home.\n\nShe does sleep in a puppy pen with her puppies but she does not like being in it. She also hates the crate. She has a high pitched shriek she lets out when she is done and is relentless until you let her out. She will probably do better gated in a room or left loose while you are gone.\n\nMartina has made herself right at home with her foster family and would love a family all her own. She is a lap dog and will want to be allowed on your furniture. She will make a wonderful companion for someone and we can't wait for her to find the perfect family for her!\n\nMartina is spayed, up to date with vaccines, microchipped, flea/worm treated and tested neg. for heartworm. Her adoption fee is $400",

Visit our FAQ webpage for commonly asked questions about our adoption/foster process.\nMy name is Petey and my owner of 7 years recently passed away. Now I wait for my new forever people. No one is entirely sure how I feel about dogs yet. I am not sure how to react to them on walks and could use a little help learning to walk better. I am a strong boy with a bit of a prey drive. But in the house I am very sweet and have never thought about touching anything that's not mine, including food on the counter. I love stretching, belly rubs, making funny snorting noises, and playing. I would love a fenced yard to run around with a tennis ball. I can get very excited and make some scary noises but soon you'll learn that I just want to play. (I can be a bit exuberant, and at 70 pounds, maybe would inadvertently knock a little person over, but never on purpose.) As long as I've had my daily exercise, I am a big couch potato and will sleep all day. I could even be a good running companion with a little training. Please fill out an application - I would love to meet you! Click here to watch a video of Petey Pooh.Last Day Dog Rescue now microchips all animals before adoption. Microchips are implanted between the animals shoulder blades and are a permanent form of identification. The microchips are registered to Last Day Dog Rescue with the adopter's info added once adopted. If the animal is ever lost and slips his/her collar/tags the microchip allows the finder to know who to contact if scanned for a microchip. Animals MUST still have a collar with tags on at all times. Per our contract, we take all our animals back if for any reason you can't keep your adopted animal.\n\nPlease understand the statements about this animal are based upon the foster home's evaluation of the animal. The animal might behave differently (negatively or positively) in your home. While the animal might be good with the current foster's dogs, cats, children, etc., it may not be with your animal(s) or children. The animal may be housebroken or litter trained in the home of the foster but may relapse in your home. The animal is represented to the public as it performs in the foster home and any statements made regarding the animal are conditional to that foster home setting. Please understand that statements made regarding this animal are simply overviews and are not guaranteed.\n\nThe Petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our animals. Visual breed identification in animals is unreliable so for most of the animals we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each animal as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our animals based on personality, not by breed label.\n\nThank you for looking through our list of animals needing forever homes and choosing rescue first. We appreciate you stopping by.",

            "description": "Domino is a 53 lb, 2 year old male terrier mix who is a fun-loving, high energy, extremely smart dog, totally housebroken. He loves to run, dig, jump and chew big sticks. He will return toys and balls that you throw but doesn't like to let go, he likes to shake it with you. Speaking of shaking, he will shake hands, sit and beg, if you say ''belly rub'' he will roll on his back to get a good rub. If you ask him what he wants, he will go to the jar where the dog cookies are and hit it with his nose. Or, he will bump your leg if he wants to go out. He loves to sit in the chair with me and he sleeps in our bed very well. He is very attached to his owner, fearful of other people and animals. He would do well with a fenced yard and being the only dog. His adoption fee is $200.00~~If you are interested in this animal, you can complete a questionnaire at http://www.hbpr.org/hb-adopt-web.html, email homeward@ellijay.com, contact us on facebook at https://www.facebook.com/HBPR30540/ or call 706-698-4663.Thank you for considering a rescue dog or cat! Don't shop when you can adopt!",

His momma Venus was pulled from an Oklahoma shelter just in time to give birth in her foster home on 1/10/21. Gravity wants a furever home that can provide a safe and loving environment for a new puppy to learn and explore. He will be available for adoption when he turns 8 weeks old on March 7th. More info and pics to come as he grows!\n\nSince this puppy may be too young to be altered at the time of adoption, the adopters will be provided with a voucher to have the puppy altered and microchipped by the time he is 6 months of age. This must be done at Nebraska Humane Society. If you prefer to take the puppy to your own vet, we will pay a PORTION of the cost ($69) to your vet of choice.\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Gravity is $500. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

Her momma Venus was pulled from an Oklahoma shelter just in time to give birth in her foster home on 1/10/21. Sirius wants a furever home that can provide a safe and loving environment for a new puppy to learn and explore. She will be available for adoption when she turns 8 weeks old on March 7th. More info and pics to come as she grows!\n\nSince this puppy may be too young to be altered at the time of adoption, the adopters will be provided with a voucher to have the puppy altered and microchipped by the time he is 6 months of age. This must be done at Nebraska Humane Society. If you prefer to take the puppy to your own vet, we will pay a PORTION of the cost ($69) to your vet of choice.\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Sirius is $500. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

His momma Venus was pulled from an Oklahoma shelter just in time to give birth in her foster home on 1/10/21. Galaxy wants a furever home that can provide a safe and loving environment for a new puppy to learn and explore. He will be available for adoption when he turns 8 weeks old on March 7th. More info and pics to come as he grows!\n\nSince this puppy may be too young to be altered at the time of adoption, the adopters will be provided with a voucher to have the puppy altered and microchipped by the time he is 6 months of age. This must be done at Nebraska Humane Society. If you prefer to take the puppy to your own vet, we will pay a PORTION of the cost ($69) to your vet of choice.\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Galaxy is $500. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

            "description": "Phoenix is the smallest male but can hold his own when it's feeding time. He likes to hang out with his twin sister Mercury. His momma Venus was pulled from an Oklahoma shelter just in time to give birth in her foster home on 1/10/21. Phoenix wants a furever home that can provide a safe and loving environment for a new puppy to learn and explore. He will be available for adoption when he turns 8 weeks old on March 7th. More info and pics to come as he grows!\n\nSince this puppy may be too young to be altered at the time of adoption, the adopters will be provided with a voucher to have the puppy altered and microchipped by the time he is 6 months of age. This must be done at Nebraska Humane Society. If you prefer to take the puppy to your own vet, we will pay a PORTION of the cost ($69) to your vet of choice.\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Phoenix is $500. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

            "description": "Ford is an inquisitive, playful, loving little guy. His interests include treat puzzles, naps, zoomies, and sunbathing. Ford's most distinguishing features include big, perky ears and a smile that takes up his whole face. Ford came to APA! after he was believed to have been hit by a car. His back legs are still a little clumsy, but he doesn't let that stop him from having a good time! If stumbles, he gets right back up and keeps going. He's still a little unsure about the stairs, but he's gaining more confidence climbing up every day! Ford is the perfect co-worker. His foster mom works from home and he lays quietly on his bed beside her either playing with a toy or taking an afternoon snooze. He does snore, but don't worry, it's cute! He's also really good at pawing at her to let her know he needs to be let outside to potty. Ford is great on a leash and loves exploring all the sights and smells of the neighborhood. He doesn't pay much mind to other dogs out for walks, but he always wags his tail and smiles at people walking by! Ford would love a home with another dog to call his friend. He has a blast chasing his foster sisters around the yard and playing tug-o-war. When he starts running faster he leaps and catches some air - it's so cute! His favorite pastime in the yard is running up the hill, rolling down and then running back up to do it all again. Of course, he'll only do it a few times before needed a puppy nap. He loves spending time outside playing and sunbathing, so a house with a yard would be ideal. Will you be Ford's fur-ever home? Be sure to follow him on Instagram for adorable photos @Adopt_Ford_APA! or @ford.is.on.automatic.",

Lou is super chill, loves walking the streets and is a dream on leash. He's crate trained and housebroken so no mishaps to worry about. Lou loves hanging with his homies including people and dogs of all sizes. Adopt Lou today and start living it up to the fullest! \n\nCharles is about 4 years old and weighs about 45 pounds.\n\nIf you're interested in meeting Lou, please visit our website to learn about our adoption process and to fill out an application, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs and cats will be micro-chipped, spayed or neutered, and up-to-date on vaccinations at the time of adoption. For more photos of Lou, follow us on Facebook Gateway Pet Guardians and Instagram @gatewaypets ... #gpgLou. \n\nTo view other adoptable pets from our shelter, please visit, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nGateway Pet Guardians is proud to offer a variety of mixed breed dogs available for adoption. However, please keep in mind that we rarely know the genetic background of the animals we rescue and, as such, we cannot guarantee the exact breed combinations found within this dog. However, we do not know his/her actual genetic makeup. Just know that this dog is probably a variety of several different breeds that have combined to create one very amazing and unique animal.",

He is a very friendly, social boy that will be a wonderful family dog.  He loves long walks, hiking trips and playing in the yard so an active family is required.  He is a typical shepherd so can be somewhat protective of his family when other dogs visit in the home so he must be the only dog.  When outdoors and away from his home, he does love to play with other large dogs.  He has great house manners and has some basic obedience but additional training will help him continue to be a well balanced pup.  Because he is such a large boy, kids must be over 14yrs old and he MUST have a large breed, German Shepherd experienced home.  He must also have a 6ft securely fenced yard... the bigger the better!",

When she first came to us, she was very nervous but once she got more comfortable, she would give so many kisses. She loves to be cuddled and is very affectionate. Violet loves to play with toys especially plush squeaky toys. Violet opens up very quickly to strangers and wants a new fur ever home to get lots of love. She just wants to have a second chance and she is such a good, sweet girl. Violet would have to do a meet n greet with any dogs before going home with them. She would do best in a home with no kids under 10.",

He has partial vision out of that eye and gets around perfectly fine (it should not get worse, but will not get better). \n\nHe is a total love bug. He currently lives with a cat and another dog, and gets along well with everyone - he would love a home with another playmate to keep him entertained. \n\nAll of our animals are examined by a veterinarian, given age-appropriate vaccinations, de-wormed, microchipped, spayed or neutered, heart-worm tested, and treated if necessary. Vet references and a home/family visit are required, and an adoption fee applies. \n\nVisit www.pmarinc.org for more information, and to fill out an application.\n\n*Please note that due to COVID we are taking extra precautions. Pre-adoption visits are at the discretion of the foster home, and transport options are not available. In most cases, prospective adopters will need to pick up the pup at the foster home.",

Haku is a 5 year old, white Great Pyrenees who has experienced some ups and downs in his life and his owner knew he deserved more so made the hard choice to surrender him to rescue. Haku was originally saved from an owner that was mistreating him but his current owner feel onto some hard times which lead to a move where Haku had to be kept outside. Understandably all of these changes have made him a little anxious, confused and depressed. Thankfully a foster home has stepped up to take this sweet boy in and we're happy that we can now provide him with the needed medical care (he has a growth on one of his hind legs), grooming, and decompression time he needs. Haku is leash trained, knows sit and down, sometimes enjoys car rides. He is a big baby who loves cuddles and playing with rubber toys, he is a couch potato.\n\nTo see the most up to date adoption status of this dog, please visit www.bigdogshugepaws.com\nThis is just one of hundreds of gentle giants available for adoption at BDHPI! It is best not to get your heart set on any one particular dog upfront because there is no guarantee they will still be available once you are approved or that they are even the right match for your family. Purebred puppies are only eligible for adoption to giant breed experienced homes.",

I have a puppy diploma in basic skills and manners class, I am potty trained, and I am looking for a family that is experienced with training that wants to continue to teach me skills. I am very smart and eager to learn, my foster parents work with me every day.\n \nThings you should know about me:\n1.     I love dinner time! I will hop around on my hind legs from PURE JOY at the sound of food.\n2.     I am working on my manners around crates, gates, and doors\u2026 sometimes tough (treats help), I love to jump and whine and bark sometimes.\n3.     I have THE FLUFFIEST tail. It curls over my back and it's really cute, probably my most adorable feature, other than my cool fur pattern.\n4.     I LOVE playing with my foster dog siblings, but sometimes I struggle with meeting new dogs when I am on a leash. I\u2019m getting better with this in training.\n5. I am awesome at playing fetch!\n \nI haven\u2019t been tested around cats or kids, I think I would very much like to chase them, like I try to chase squirrels while on walks. My prey drive is strong. Also, I am very good at catching stink bugs :)\n \nI know you will get lost in my loving stare, and make me yours!\n \nLove,\nBasil",

However, no one has told this handsome boy yet that he is a BIG boy as he believes he is a lap dog ? He loves to be around his people. He is good with other dogs and my children (youngest is 11yrs old.) Charlie would love to have his own backyard as he enjoys being outside. He is also very happy on a walk and minds his manners well. He knows sits and takes treats gently.  He would be great as an only dog or with other younger to middle aged playful dogs.\n\nCharlie is up to date on shots, rabies, microchipped and is heartworm negative. He will be available for adoption after January 18th when he gets neutered. If you are interested in being Charlie\u2019s forever family please submit your application to myhappytail@yahoo.com. His adoption fee is $125 and an application can be found under the How to Adopt menu on our website at \nwww.myhappytail.org\n\nNo doubt Charlie will be a loyal friend for life!",

We were originally on a rescue for another dog when our director Lisa spotted Godiva and her brother being transported loosely in the bed of a truck. When Lisa inquired with the drivers, they said the puppies were for sale and Lisa paid them off to bring these babies into our care for medical, and to find them an incredible forever home.\n\nGodiva is super friendly, smart, curious and adventurous. She greets every human and dog with a wagging tail and just as much as she loves to play with her brother and other dogs, she loves for the humans to join. While playful, she is also very laid back and will put herself to bed when she\u2019s tired. According to her fosters, she is nearly potty trained and we\u2019re very happy about that!\n\nGodiva is going to grow up to be a big, strong girl (60-70lbs) and will need a dedicated family preferably with bully breed experience who will give her LOTS of needed daily exercise. Like any of our Pitties, her adopters will be required to invest in training! Applicants must have a backyard and preferably another doggy sibling.\n\n**We are looking for applicants who are based in Southern California and if there are children in the home, children must be 10 years or older.\n\n**The adoption fee is $500. Our rescue covers microchip, vaccinations to her adoption date, and spaying at one of our veterinarians when she's old enough.\n\n**If you're interested in Godiva, you must visit our website and fill out an application here: https://bigloveanimalrescue.org/adoption-application-form/\n\n**No meet and greets prior to approved application.\n\n**Due to the volume of messages we receive on all of our platforms, we do NOT send follow up emails to our applicants and do not reply to messages here on PetFinder. We\u2019re a small, volunteer ran rescue so we can only do so much in 24 hours. Thank you for understanding!\n\nAgain, please no repeat emails. If we feel you're the right fit, we will contact you.\n\nwww.bigloveanimalrescue.org",

I can be a little stand offish when I first meet strangers, but I warm up fairly quickly. I love to run the play yard here, but I also love to nap and to chew on my bone. I like getting attention on my terms, as I can be quite independent. I LOVE treats. They are the way to my heart. Right now, I'm a chunky hippo and could lose a few pounds so don't over do it! I'm such a sweet girl once I get to know you. I'm looking for my fur-ever home and I'm ready to settle down. Sometimes I show some signs of separation anxiety when I'm away from the caretakers. It could be because living in the kennels can be so stressful sometimes, but I tend to bark when no one is around. I can get worked up sometimes around other dogs, so it would probably be best if I were the only dog in the home. I could probably go home with some older kids too. I might be a little rough with youngins. Come stop by Stray Haven so we can meet!! I'd love to eat some treats you wanna give me.\nStray Haven Humane Society & SPCA\n194 Shepard Rd., Waverly, NY 14892\n(607) 565-2859, www.strayhavenspca.org \nOpen hours (winter): Tues, Wed & Thurs Noon - 6pm; Sat 10am-4pm",

The shelter has a few options to help with treatment, and if I steal your heart you should talk with them and your vet about what my treatment is like. For more information on heartworms, please visit the American Heartworm Society here https://www.heartwormsociety.org/pet-owner-resources/heartworm-basics\n\nI am currently in a foster home and not at HSNBA, if you are interested in meeting me, please contact the nice folks at HSNBA so they can put you in contact with my foster family to set up a meet & greet. E-mail HSNBA at adoption@hsnba.org, call us at: (830) 629-5287 or stop by and speak with the folks at HSNBA at 3353 Morningside Dr. to get your information sent over to my foster home. My foster family is the best and can give you more information on me.HSNBA lists all animals online from the moment of intake, and our listings are updated automatically every midnight. Some of these animals may not be available for adoption at this moment, but you can always call the shelter at 830-629-5287 for clarification on the adoption process or the animal's current status.",

In addition to running around and playing with my toys I love endless amounts of cuddles! I have been learning some basic commands and am working on my potty training. I just want to find my loving furever home! I don't think I would be very comfortable with children in the home, their high energy is a bit too much for me.\n\nAs for dogs, I LOVE PLAYING, and I am a good player, but sometimes I can be a little too much because of my energy. I also still need to be tested with cats.\n\nIf you think your dog can handle a ball of joy like me, please let the shelter know!All cats and dogs adopted from the Chequamegon Humane Association are spayed or neutered, up-to-date on age appropriate vaccinations, dewormed, and microchipped. Dogs are tested for heartworm and cats are tested for FeLV/FIV (results negative unless otherwise noted). A tax-deductible adoption fee of $150 is required for adult dogs, puppies are $200, and dogs over the age of 10 are $85. Adult cat adoption fees are $50, kittens under one year are $90, and cats over the age of 10 are $35.",

            "description": "Breed: Labrador Retriever mix\nSex: Male\nDOB: ~12/31/2014\nWeight: 41 lbs\nEnergy Level: Medium\nPersonality Type: Sweet, \nHistory: Surrender/Transfer from animal control\nGood With: Dogs\nIdeal Home: Low traffic home where someone is home with him much of the time! Apartments could be ok.\nFence Requirements: Not required.\nSpecial Info: Buddy LOVES to go for walks and car rides! He can be a bit protective of his kennel. Buddy can climb chain link fences.\n\nThe information we are providing for this animal was developed based on observations and assessments in a shelter or foster environment. We do our best to provide information that will help determine if the dog might be a good fit for you. Please note that behaviors may change in a home environment. We also ask our applicants to assume that any animal they adopt from us will need to be potty trained and learn house manners, although this is not always the case. Our online animal bios are designed to provide as much information as possible and answer some anticipated questions. We do not have the resources to respond to emails with more specific questions.\n\nWe are receiving an unusually high number of applications per pet at this time! Please follow the rules below to ensure your application is reviewed; pay attention closely to these instructions because applications will NOT be processed if they are not followed. Please keep in mind that dog/cat availability is currently changing by the hour; you will receive an email if the animal you are interested in is no longer available. New dogs become available almost every day, so feel free to let us know if someone else interests you if your initial choice is already adopted! \n\nFill out the application (DOG: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IHD-DOG-Application-9-10-18.pdf, CAT: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IHD-CAT-Application.pdf) completely. Every question must be answered, and it must be signed. If you are going to type your responses, open the application, save it, type your answers, and save it again. \n\n-Applicants must be 21+ years old and live within a 50-mile radius of our shelter at 22415 Groesbeck Hwy, Warren 48089.\n\n-You must identify at least 1 dog/cat that you are interested in. If there are multiple dogs/cats, number them in order of priority. \n\n-Scan a copy of proof of home ownership (i.e. tax bill, deed, or mortgage payment - you can black out the account #, etc.) or animal clause/agreement of your rental agreement.\n\n-Attach the application and home ownership proof/rental agreement animal clause to a new email and send it to bark@iheartdogs.org. The subject line must be formatted to read \"\"#1 choice of dog/cat, Your First and Last Name\"\". Example: Subject: Fido, Jane Doe\nOnce your application is received, it will be assigned to an Adoption Counselor who will follow-up with the applicant who is the best fit within a few days, or to discuss other dogs/cats. It could take up to a couple of weeks for you to receive a final disposition on your application so there is no need to check on the status.\n\n-Introductions will be scheduled by appointment only, 45 minutes per appointment. The entire household, including current dogs, must be present for the appointment. The introductions will take place outside in our parking lot.\n\n-We will continue to perform vet checks for current and prior pets in the household.\n\n-Home visits will be in person for the yard and virtual for inside the home.\n\n-Finalizing the adoption will also be scheduled by appointment.\n\nWhile this process may seem cumbersome, it is interim during COVID-19, and it is designed to help us respond to the volume of emails we receive every day. Since we are receiving a high volume of applications, please be patient if a dog/cat is no longer available. \n\nThank you for your understanding.",

            "description": "Hello everyone, my name is Xena! My breed is a Pitbull mix, but really Im a big ball of love. Im around a year old and I love all humans and all dogs!! I have a lot of energy and would love another dog in my forever home.\n\nMy ideal play mate would be okay with playing rough and also be okay with me being a little vocal while playing too. I have a pretty high prey drive and though my foster mama doesnt think Id hurt the cats, its probably best I go to a home that doesnt have any so I dont accidentally hurt them while Im trying to play.\n\nIm great with kids of all ages, but because of my energy level itd be best for a home without littles that I might accidentally knock down with the endless kisses I give.\nAlthough Im a tank right now, that wont last with a diet and a little exercise, cause I know I kind of need that to help slim down a bit. I also have really good recall and learn really fast, so training will be a breeze!\n\nCurrently, I'm intact and have a spay surgery scheduled at the very end of December that my adoptive family will be required to keep. So we'll be requiring a spay contract with my new family to ensure that happens.\n\nApply here: https://www.fetchfosterandrescue.com/adopt\n\nName: Xena\nSex: Female\nBreed: Pitbull Mix\nAge: 1 year\nWeight:\nCurrent on vaccines: Yes\nAltered: No (*spay contract)\nMicrochipped: Yes\nAdoption: 300\nGood with Cats: No\nGood with Kids: Older preferred\nGood with other Dogs: Yes\n\n*Positive reinforcement obedience training is a great way to bond with your new family member. It can also help set up a relationship with greater odds of success integrating your new pet into your family. Anyone who provides proof of completed positive reinforcement training will receive a 50 dollar refund from Fetch Foster and Rescue Inc! If you have questions or are wondering if the class you want to take qualifies please reach out! \n\nFetch Foster and Rescue Inc is a 501c3 non-profit organization",

My foster mom is available 24/7 to tell you all about how perfect and special I am.\n\n \n\nOnce I feel a bit comfortable, I am a pretty funny little dude, similar to a Mexican Jumping Bean; spunky for sure! I have so many toys here I just dont even know how I will find time to play with them all. I really like toys, so if you have toys I can definitely help you play with them. I have had some pretty bad and scary stuff happen to me in the past and I dont want to talk about it. That's why I want to move forward with a patient, forever family and leave that icky stuff behind. \n\n \n\nIm not a fan of sudden moments, so screaming children running around the house doesn't sound like a good match for me. It just makes me uneasy. I have a foster sister who is sooooo cool. She is older than me, but she still plays with me and we have a hoot! So if you have another dog, I would really like that and if they happen to be confident that would probably be pretty cool too.\n\n \n\nIm going to need time to warm up and Im really not looking to be fixed so I may never be outgoing, however I know I am lovable and entertaining and I will be so loyal to you if you love me forever. So if you want to meet me and fall in love with a guy like me, please apply and we can set up a date!\n\n \n\nName: Mark\n\nBreed: Hound Mix\n\nAge: 4 years\n\nWeight: 35 lbs\n\nCurrent on vaccines: Yes\n\nAltered: Yes\n\nMicrochipped: Yes\n\nAdoption: 300 + GPS collar\n\nGood with Cats: Unknown\n\nGood with Older Kids: Yes\n\nGood with other Dogs: Yes\n\n \n\n*Due to this dog's history, for their safety, they will be adopted with a GPS collar. The cost is $149, which includes the collar and a 1 year subscription of the gps tracking services.\n\n \n\n*Positive reinforcement obedience training is a great way to bond with your new family member.

            "description": "**PLEASE READ ALL - TWO MONTHS AGO I WAS COMPLETELY FERRAL**\n\n \n\nHey there everyone. Im Blossom and Im a work in progress. I havent had much human interaction before coming to Fetch and I have no idea what it is to be a house dog, but man Im learning. \n\n \n\nIm nervous of people and need time to come out of my shell, but Im learning ear scratchies, treats and cuddles on the couch are pretty nice things. I still get nervous with fast movements (so little kiddos scare me) and retreat to the safety of my kennel when I get nervous so please have patience with me. \n\n \n\nIm learning so many new things including walking on a leash (man that stuff touching my neck is annoying! Sometimes I bite at it to try to get it off yet, but just go slow and remind me its no big deal). Im also learning how to potty outside and am doing great! But keep in mind, Im a work in progress and so are ALL my new skills. \n\n \n\nI LOVE other dogs and will need at least one fur sibling (but I would love more too). Having other dogs around really helps me loosen up, try new things, and find my confidence. \n\n \n\nIm young and I have my whole life ahead of me. I still do puppy things like grab paper towels and shred them (man theyre just so fun) and annoy my foster siblings to play constantly. I hope one day Im not scared when people move off the couch or when I hear a new noise outside, but right now thats where Im at. Like Ive mentioned, work in progress. Im a huge flight risk outside so even if you have a fence, I will always need to be leashed when going outside for potty breaks or play time. \n\n \n\nI would love someone with lots of patience and time to help me find my confidence and just be like any other dog. This process could be super bonding for us and I would love you forever for helping me, but it will be a process. Please, if youre interested in me, be willing to meet me where Im at and take extra precautions to keep me safe in your home. \n\n \n\nI would really love a family of my own if youre ready for me.\n\n \n\nApply here: https://www.fetchfosterandrescue.com/adopt\n\n \n\nName: Blossom\n\nSex: Female\n\nBreed: Shepherd Mix\n\nAge: 10 months\n\nWeight: 20 lbs\n\nCurrent on vaccines: Yes \n\nAltered: Yes\n\nMicrochipped: Yes \n\nAdoption: 300 + *GPS contract \n\nGood with Cats: Yes\n\nGood with Kids: Yes, older kids\n\nGood with other Dogs: Yes \n\n \n\n*Due to this dog's history of being feral, they are considered a possible flight risk. Just to be safe, there's a $99 GPS collar they'll be adopted with. \n\n \n\n*Positive reinforcement obedience training is a great way to bond with your new family member. It can also help set up a relationship with greater odds of success integrating your new pet into your family. Anyone who provides proof of completed positive reinforcement training will receive a 50 dollar refund from Fetch Foster and Rescue Inc! If you have questions or are wondering if the class you want to take qualifies please reach out! \n\n \n\nFetch Foster and Rescue Inc is a 501c3 non-profit organization",

If you're willing to give him the time that he needs the payoff will be well worth it. He hasn't shown aggression toward other dogs from a short distance, but he would still need to take things slow, same as with people. Norman needs a patient, loving home in order to really come out of his shell. \nWill you give Norman the space and understanding he needs? The payoff will be a very loyal and loving dog who will follow you around and sleep close to you.",

Bishop is roughly 7 years old and from our best guess is a Beagle, Terrier mix weighing about 35 lbs. Pictures of him are deceiving because he looks much bigger but he is a pretty petite dog. He is microchipped, fixed and fully house trained.\n\nBishop ideally needs a home where hes:\n\n The only dog, or with smaller dogs, preferably. He loved our Pomeranian but was sometimes scared of groups of larger dogs or in-your-face dogs. He has done well with larger dogs in our home (never on leash) but was never a fan of dog parks. \n\n A home without cats. Cats, squirrels and rabbits are practically all the same in his eye and will be chased.\n\n A home without small children. Hes perfectly accepting of older children, adults, groups and every stranger [ not a great security dog ] He finds children very scary and did bite the toddler in his home after being chased- ultimately leading to his rehoming. \n\n Able to be active but also lounge around to his hearts content. He gets spurts of energy but is a very chill, old soul.\n\n Accepted as either big spoon or little spoon because hes a professional cuddler. \n\n A home with a great cook because he hates the sound of the fire alarm and one where pillows are abundant because he takes comfort pretty seriously.\n\nBishop loves a good nap on furniture but he also knows no. He is allowed on some of our furniture and not others and fully abides, he hates his kennel but can be trusted when away from home (never chews, scratches, barks or counter hops). \n\nYou can also look at our old Instagram account @sabestagrams for more insight into this quirky, loving dog who is sure to win over someones heart as he did ours. Bishop just wants to love and be loved back",

At 4ish months and 15 lb, Fantine is the biggest of her litter of 4 but was also nervous at first despite her size. Gentle, curious, and playful she was nonetheless mostly interested in resting in her crate. But after just a day and night in her new foster home, Fantine has totally come out of her shell (and the crate).\n\n \n\nShe loves to play with her many toys, is playfully chatty, super cuddly (so so so soft!), endlessly curious, and always sporting a big grin. She sleeps through the night in her crate other than to tell you she needs to use the bathroom. Out on her walks, she does great on the leash, does her business, likes to say hi to the neighbors and their dogs, and catching her reflection on glass doors. Fantine will make a fantastic dog for just about anyone -- she loves to cuddle and hang out just as much as romping around and adventure -- and she's got plenty of energy for both!\n\n \n\nFantine is spayed, up-to-date on vaccinations, microchipped, and heartworm negative.\n\n \n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

I am still working on my basic commands but I am great in my crate and sleep well overnight without accidents. I am eager to learn and please. I would be a great addition to any family and since I love to play a fursibling would be awesome. \n\n \n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

Albert is shy at first meeting new people but he's been working on his confidence in his foster home and he is starting to warm up quickly.\n\nAlbert loves to do zoomies around the yard, chew bones, and event cuddle on your lap. Albert is great with other dogs and we feel like he definitely watched other dog's interactions with humans so it would be great if he could be adopted to a home with a confident. Also because of his timid nature, we would recommend a home with kids over the age of 12. \n\nHes also house trained, crate trained, and sleeps through the night without making a peep. He's also been working on leash training and basic commands.\n\nAlbert is an easy foster that enjoys quiet time in his crate. We know he would make a great addition to the right family!\n \n\nAlbert on a walk: https://youtu.be/KOwteLQVlyM\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

For a dog who spent much of its life as a stray I really, really adore life and everything in it. I am about 8 months old mix (Australian Kelpie looks like) and will give you a toothache is so sweet. My brother and I were both found on the street and I am overcoming being scared slowly, my family takes me on hikes and walks and I'm slowly becoming braver, another dog would definitely help with that. I love all other dogs even though I will need slow intros and time to warm up as initially I'm very defensive. I'm so sweet and submissive, all types of dogs love me once I warm up! My scars tell a very different story than I would. Before coming to 2 Blondes I got hit by a porcupine when arriving my face was pretty messed up and now it's been taken care of and I'm healing. I'm excited to start my new life getting belly rubs, cuddles and kisses all day long. I'm working hard on sit and other manners. I definitely have some herding breed in me as I'm VERY mouthy at this time small children would not be good for me as I bite to show my love. I will sleep in the kennel at night but I don't go in willingly, I am about 99% potty trained, I know sit and my family is slowly working on other skills. I enjoy all toys including the puzzle ones, mom says since I've got some herding breed is very smart. I really want to be the best girl and I am looking for my furever home to show me that chance! As my face is still healing I may not be available immediately, but am still available for meet and greets!\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

He has done this twice, once when the fedex man came and once with the toddler, in both situations he was asleep and was startled awake. Both broke the skin but didn't require medical attention. His family has spoken about euthanizing him but instead they are willing to allow us to step in and help. We need a foster or adoptive home willing to work with him to feel safe. We will also get his hearing checked to make sure there isn't an impairment that is also attributing to the situation. \n\nWill have a behavioral waiver\n\nDue to his predominant breed being an English Bulldog we are seeking an adopter with BRACHYCEPHALIC BREED EXPERIENCE. Further all our brachycephalic dogs MUST vet at an AAHA certified vet, this is because of their extreme vet needs. Brachycephalic dogs are extremely expensive dogs to upkeep so please bare that in mind when applying and make sure you're in a financial place to take it on.\n\n \n\n $400.00 Adoption Fee \n\n(Which is considered a non refundable donation and being we are a 501c3 organization it is tax deductible. The fee itself is not negotiable, our vets don't negotiate and thus neither do we.)\n\nIf you can help please contact us ASAP!\n\nTo Contact Us\n\nMessage us through our website http://www.highplainspaw.org\n\nMessage the Facebook Page at https://www.facebook.com/HighPlainsPAW\n\nFill out our Adoption Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/adoption-application\n\nFill out our Foster Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/foster-application\n\nEmail us at highplainspaw@gmail.com\n\nCall our VOICEMAIL at (402)957-1578\n\nWE DO NOT HAVE A FACILITY ALL OUR DOGS ARE LOCATED IN FOSTER HOMES. This means there is no place for you to go in person to view our dogs. We ask that an application be filled out and we will go from there!",

My foster family lovingly calls me Bonnie Roo because when I get excited or happy my bark sounds like rooster roo-ing! \n\nI\u2019m a young girl (about one year of age) and I\u2019m pretty petite, and weigh only 7 lbs.  \n\nMy friends at Rhodie\u2019s Rescue saved me when they were notified by a property owner that I was living in a pipe. I don\u2019t know how I ended up there, but I was so terrified and cold I was shaking bad and I was starving cause I hadn\u2019t eaten in a while....my bones were showing everywhere. As soon as they caught me and brought me home, I felt safe and I got to eat really good food! My bones are no longer showing and I don\u2019t even think about my \u2018past life\u2019 anymore! I\u2019m having way to much fun in my foster home! \n I Love other small dogs and will play all day with them. I really want to have a young, friendly and playful small doggie in my new home so we can play and have fun together. \nI like the cats in my foster home and try to play with them so if you have a cat(s) I hope they are dog friendly. \nI\u2019m always on the go, play play play, then eat and back to play!  \nI absolutely LOVE toys! I play tug-of-war, and if you throw balls \nI\u2019ll go run to pick them up but, I won\u2019t bring them back to you! LOL  \nI\u2019ll jump up on your lap for a little cuddles then off I go\nI\u2019m full of energy so another little doggie to play with will be ideal. \n\nI\u2019m still working on house training and getting the hang of it, but I still have accidents. \nI\u2019m learning to walk on a leash but will need continued training... I\u2019m very scared on the leash so my foster Mom has been working with me just in the house and yard. \nI sleep quietly in my crate at night. \nI\u2019d love to have a gentle family and playful doggie friend to call my own! \nMy adoption fee is $300 which includes health examination, current vaccinations, spay, microchip, along with any other medical or dental deemed necessary by our veterinarian.\n\n\n\n",

Multiple dogs and cats come to the shelter EVERY DAY, which means animals must also be moving out at the same rate. Unfortunately, sometimes there are larger adult, \"pitbull\" or mix-breed dogs that are continually overlooked for their younger or more \"adoptable\" counterparts.

He was rescued from Texas, where there is an overwhelming number of homeless pets, with limited resources to help them. Pepper is an active boy who loves to play. He is friendly and outgoing with everyone he meets. \n\nPlease fill out the adoption application at https://snarrnortheast.org/ if you are interested in adopting Pepper. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n-------------------------------------------------------\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES: $495 for puppies / $375 for adults. Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n\n\n\n",

            "description": "Lexi was rescued from Texas, where there is an overwhelming number of homeless pets and limited resources to help them. Lexi is around 2 years old and very loving and outgoing. She is friendly with everyone she meets. She loves to play ball and loves attention. She has a cute short and stocky body. Lexi would love to find a family to call her own and will arrive in New York on January 23rd. \n\n**PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING**\n\nIf you are interested in adopting any of the puppies, our adoption fee is $495 ( puppies) $375 (adults) which includes transportation from the South and we do suggest putting a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several littermates.\n\n**Please understand that we are a volunteer based organization. While our volunteers try to answer all emails/questions as quickly as possible, below please find answers to some of our most frequently asked questions. We ask that you please read these FAQ's to see if your question has already been answered before emailing additional questions:\n\n- If a dog or puppy is listed on Petfinder, they are still available. Please do not email asking if they are still available. If a dog or puppy is still listed, then we are still accepting applications :-) We do not go on a first come first serve basis, but on best fit for the family and most importantly, the puppy or dog.\n\n- We are taking our best guess on breed and size when fully-grown (or already an adult), based on the puppy's/dog\u2019s physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. We rarely are able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. \n\n- Our dogs/puppies are either at our Adoption Center in Brewster, NY, in foster care, or are adopted straight from transport. An application is necessary to meet any dog/puppy. Often, dogs and puppies are spoken for before they arrive. Many people feel more comfortable with a meet and greet which we completely understand and respect, however please know you are taking a chance of that puppy/dog getting adopted by someone else before hand.\n\n- The way to start the process for any dog or puppy is by filling out an application. Applications for foster or adoption can be found at www.snarrnortheast.org and by clicking either adopt or foster from the main menu. If you fill out an application, please make sure you answer all the questions in as much detail as possible and that you receive a confirmation email, otherwise we did NOT receive it.",

            "description": "***Meredith is available only through the Foster to Adopt Program***\n\nHi, my name is Meredith but you can call me sweetie because everyone says I'm so sweet. I love to greet friends at the door. I just love to see company and to be honest, I do good in anyone's arms. I just love giving hugs and have no problem putting my head on your shoulder for long periods of time. I'm good at calming you down and have no problem doing what you say. I just want to make you happy and I think you will be when you come to see me :-)\n\nFOSTER TO ADOPT:\nMeredith is Heartworm positive and is starting her Heartworm treatment. This treatment takes about 3 months with 3-5 appointments at our vets in Minnetonka. After the treatment series is completed, a heartworm test is done a month later and repeated in the months following until a negative test result is achieved. A negative result can take up to 2-9 months after treatment. During the treatment and until the test result is negative, she will need to make sure her heart rate is not elevated due to high energy play or exercise. Meredith is only available through the Foster to Adopt Program at this time. The foster to adopt commitment will be for an ADOPTION but will be actually fostering until she is cleared with a negative Heartworm test result, which at that time, we will make the adoption official. It is a program for a commitment. All of the medical expenses will be paid for by the rescue while she is in a foster to adopt home. Food, kennel, grooming and other supplies will be provided by the foster in the foster to adopt program. \n\nMeredith also will need to be spayed as her puppies just turned 8 weeks old and are in the process of getting adopted. The spay will happen over the next few months at the rescue's vet in Minnetonka. \n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nAll our Warrior Dogs will have all age appropriate medical care and vaccines, a microchip, and spay/neuter before adoption unless age is a factor with a puppy younger than 6-12 months at the time of adoption. If that is the case, the spay/neuter will be covered in the adoption fee and the owner will be responsible to have the procedure completed at a Warrior Dog Rescue Veterinarian at the appropriate time.\n\nPlease note that the majority of our dogs in rescue are from shelters where they have been found as strays or abandoned. Their breed description is based on our very best educated guess based on physical characteristics and their dispositions. If they came to our rescue as an owner surrender, the breed description will be listed as provided by the previous owner.\n\nAdoption Fee - $450\n\nTo apply for this pup, please submit an Adoption Application at http://warriordogrescue.com/adopt/adoption-application/",

A year ago Frida was saved by rescue near Skopje, Macedonia. She was emaciated and her front leg cut. Humans had let her down until a local hero step in and rescued her.  She was treated by a vet and taken to the rescue kennel. Frida never lost her faith in humanity. She is a happy girl, loves everyone, kids and dogs. She gives so much love that you wouldn\u2019t think is possible. She is arriving in Los Angeles from Macedonia January 18th week. She has 3 legs and a minor heart murmur that is treated with medication, this that doesn\u2019t stop her from running around and enjoying life and spreading love. She is looking for her perfect forever home where they would love her unconditionally.  Frida is a sweet, kind and gentle dog.\n If interested adopting, please contact for an adoption application or any questions you might have Silvia 914-519-8771 or Silvia.pogosyan@gmail.com",

She\u2019s curious about other dogs and walked nicely side by side on leash with another calm female her size.\n\nShe is scheduled to be spayed and microchipped in 2 weeks.\n\nWe are now accepting applications for her forever human!\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in meeting this angel, please tap the link in our bio to fill out our adoption application.",

He currently weighs about 20 lbs and we think he\u2019ll weigh 50 lbs or more when fully grown.\n\n\u2022 Ian is very energetic and loves to play!  We feel that he needs a home with another young playful dog or puppy. We\u2019d ask you to bring your dog to meet Ian to see if they could be good buddies.  He lives with other dogs in his foster home.\n\n\u2022 Ian will need a house with a fenced yard.\n\n\u2022 Ian had a rough beginning. He and his mom and his brother, Fergus, were very neglected and had been wandering the streets. They were very skinny. (Fergus has an adoption pending and is scheduled to go to his new home later this week.)\n\n\u2022 Ian can be a teeny bit timid at first, but he\u2019s playful and fun-loving, so it doesn\u2019t take him long at all to warm up to new people and situations.  He's also food motivated!\n\n\u2022 Ian is just a baby, so he\u2019ll need more work on house training and other basic training. \n\n\u2022 He\u2019s been vaccinated, neutered and microchipped. \n\nMORE ON ADOPTING OUR DOGS... \n\n> COVID-19 UPDATE:  PLEASE SUBMIT AN ONLINE ADOPTION APPLICATION AND A MEMBER OF OUR ADOPTIONS TEAM WILL REACH OUT TO YOU.  Please visit our web site at HSGKC.ORG for an adoption application, our current COVID-19 adoption protocol, and other adoption info.\u00a0\n\n> If you decide you'd like to adopt one of the pets you meet, we reserve the pet for you but we generally don't send the pet home with you that day. We\u2019ll instead schedule a pick up date and time that\u2019s convenient for you.\u00a0  \n\n> Our goal is to send you home with a healthy pet and any information and support you may need to help your new pet adjust to his or her new home.  All of our dogs & puppies have been spayed or neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, treated for fleas & ticks, tested for heartworms (7 mo. and over), and are on monthly heartworm preventative. Puppies who are too young to receive all the necessary puppy boosters and/or first rabies shot may be brought back to us for those vaccines at no extra charge. You will also receive a leash, collar, coupons for pet supplies and services, toys, and educational materials. And we'll give your dog a bath before he or she goes home! \n\n> Please note that we prefer and may require a fenced yard for many of our dogs.  Exceptions are made on an individual basis depending on the dog's needs, the person's dog experience, the dog's and person's activity levels, home environment and other factors. \n\nThank you for searching for a shelter pet!\n\nDog Adoption Contact Info:\nEmail: christine@hsgkc.org\nPhone: 913.521.2339\nhsgkc.org",

He was so well-behaved on the leash and although he is incredibly strong, he walked very well on the leash. Stopped promptly at all intersections when we did with minimal effort.\n\nAs a puppy, he did get a burst of energy and played tug of war with his leash, and he some playful growls and very soft playful nipping. He was so sweet and gentle with his playfulness and eventually was ready to walk alongside us again.\n\nDog for a day 1/21\n\nWe had a great time with\nTydus\non the UCF campus.\nTydus\nwas great in the car and walked with us very well. He is very friendly and loved to bounce around and play with us. He loved meeting new people and it was so much fun to see him make friends. After a good walk, he just laid down in the shade and fell asleep leaning on us. This is an incredibly sweet, high-energy dog. Go say hi to\nTydus\n!!!\n\nTydus is a beautiful and friendly Akita. When he first came to our facility, he was very excited to be around people and acted friendly to everyone. Tydus was owner surrendered to a high kill shelter as his owners were concerned with his food aggression around the kids.\n\nTydus is up to date on all vaccinations, microchipped, and neutered. His previous family recommended no children or cats. They stated he is good with other dogs, housetrained, and good with both men and women. An Akita or large/dominant breed experienced owner and a 6' fenced backyard is required.\n\nIf you would like to meet Tydus, please put an application in. We will update his webpage as we get to know him better here at the center.",

I an crate trained and house trained. I get along with other dogs but can also be an only dog as I am very human oriented. I can be a perfect companion for a human that is looking for a low key girl that is not a crazy youngster and already has manners. I am very sweet and would do anything for a treat. I am working on my leash/heeling technique. I ride great in the car and love all humans.

Loves people, dogs, cats, you name it. She is very loving and affectionate, she insists on cuddles. She requires a loving home that is at least somewhat savvy with beagles and doxies because they will no doubt follow their noses.  Therefore, a fenced yard  with supervised yard time is ideal, or a very active walking schedule. She loves to play and really enjoys the company of other animal in the household.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blanche, you could submit an application online to our website www.Valhallarescue.org\n\nBlanche's adoption fee is $500 and helps to ensure that all our animals are vaccinated, microchipped and altered. Due to the pandemic, we currently have her on a Foster to adopt contract until we can arrange to get her spayed. Please contact the rescue for one information and to discuss our policy and adoption options for Blanche.\n\n Thank you for looking at Blanche and have a nice day",

Unfortunately his owner became ill and needed to move in with his family for assisted care. His owner was completely heart broken to not be able to take Spike with him. We took Spike into our care and reassured his dad that we will do all that we can to make sure Spike gets a good loving home. \nSpike is an approximately 4 years old neutered McNab Dog (commonly referred to as a McNab Shepherd or McNab Collie). As you can see in the pictures, Spike\u2019s nose is \u201cabnormal\u201d. While with his previous owner he got amazing vet care and was diagnosed with Discoid Lupus Erythematosus (DLE or just Lupus). This is a non-contagious skin condition. \nAccording to VCAhospitals.com, \u201cdogs with Discoid Lupus Erythematosus (DLE) develop crusting and scabbing of the skin, most commonly around the nose, as well as a loss of skin pigmentation in the affected area\u201d \nIt is an auto-immune disease and the underlying cause is unknown. After some trial & error treatments Spike has greatly improved simply by taking a daily dose of Prednisone (a steroid prescribed by the veterinarian) and having a prescription cream.\nSpike would do fantastic in an active home and would love to have a job. He is one of the smartest dogs we have met. It may take some time for him to warm up to a new environment but once he does he is totally engaged in the family. It is important that his forever family have an understanding of how DLE can effect him such as using proper protection on his nose while in the sun for long periods of time. UV light can be harsh on a bald nose. He also has a condition called Pannus which is autoimmune and requires protection from the sun and daily eyedrops.  He is willing to wear his Doggles when he is outdoors with his people but it takes some convincing. Veterinarians and Google are a great source of information on Pannus and DLE.\nSpike would love to meet you to see if he could be yours forever. Please don\u2019t be scared of his mild \u201cspecial needs\u201d. As I always say, adopting a new family member, no matter the needs, isn\u2019t a challenge, it\u2019s just an adjustment. Call or text us if you would like to set up a meet & greet with this special boy!! PJ @ Fetch Cares 540-383-7522, Tori @ Fetch Cares 540-383-7521\n#needsahome #fosteringsaveslives #fosterdog #fosterdogsofinstagram #fetchcares #fetchparkcity #parkcitydogs #mcnabdog \nJuly 19, 2020 UPDATE: \nSpike who we now refer to as Mike (he doesn\u2019t seem to mind ?). As you may remember, Mike was diagnosed with Lupus which causes lesions and crusting of the skin usually around the nose and face. Taking care of him following a recent flare up has been challenging, but he is certainly worth it. He has been visiting the specialist dermatologist at Blue Pearl, Dr. Layne, who has been wonderful. You may also remember that Mike has an autoimmune issue called Pannus that affects his eyes. To care for his eyes, he has been seeing the specialist ophthalmologist at Blue Pearl, Dr. Disney who has been awesome. Unfortunately the symptoms for both Lupus and Pannus are exasperated by UV light and, of course, one of Mikes\u2019s favorite things to do is sunbathe. Dr. Layne recommended a nose cover and RexSpec goggles which are specifically designed for dogs with these types of conditions. He sure looks handsome in his gear but, as you can imagine, it takes GREAT patience for him to get used to wearing them. He has been doing really well considering how weird it must feel for him to be wearing them. One of our Fetch staff members, Christie, has taken on Mike as her \u201cproject\u201d. She takes him swimming, hiking, car rides, works on training etc. He has been living the life that every dog dreams of. He is completely in love with her and it\u2019s so awesome all of the socialization and active exposure he has been getting. However, Mike is looking for his forever home. Mike would make a amazing dog for someone who would be willing to take him into their family knowing he has these lifelong conditions. You wouldn\u2019t be sorry, this boy loves his people with every inch of his big heart. \nIf you would like to meet Mike contact us at 435-777-3771 or fetchcares@gmail.com #fosteringsaveslives #fosterdog #fosterdogsofinstagram #fetchcares #fetchparkcity #parkcitydogs #mcnabdog\n\nTHIS IS A COURTESY LISTING. HUNAH IS NOT PLACING THIS DOG. PLEASE CONTACT THE OWNER DIRECTLY.\n\n\n\n",

Loves people, dogs, cats, you name it. She is very loving and affectionate, she insists on cuddles.\n\nDorothy is the most submissive of her litter and may have submissive behaviors while she gets used to her new environment. Don't let that deter you though it's part of her amazing charm and when she is comfortable it goes away.\n\nShe requires a loving home that is at least somewhat savvy with beagles and doxies because she will no doubt follow her nose.  Therefore, a fenced yard  with supervised yard time is ideal, or a very active walking schedule. She loves to play and really enjoys the company of other animal in the household.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Dorothy, you could submit an application online to our website www.Valhallarescue.org\n\nDorothy's adoption fee is $500 and helps to ensure that all our animals are vaccinated, microchipped and altered. Due to the pandemic, we currently have her on a Foster to adopt contract until we can arrange to get her spayed. Please contact the rescue for one information and to discuss our policy and adoption options for Dorothy.\n\n Thank you for looking at Dorothy and have a nice day.",

I am a handsome, sweet and docile 8 month old, 48 lbs boy! \nI am very crate trained, house trained, ride great in the car. \nI have a great personality  I am mellow and in despite of my age I don\u2019t require a ton of exercise. I still love to play but I know how to settle with a toy in my crate when my foster mom is busy or has to go out to run errands.\nI still need work on the leash but because of my mellow and docile demeanor is not difficult. Also Im very food oriented what makes training a walk in the park!\nI love to play with female dogs, male dogs I hang out as long as they are not mean but I do feel iffy about them also I can be an only child as long as you have time to take me on walks and dedicate time to stimulate me physically and mentally with games or one on one time! \nIf you are looking for a young companion that has a great balance between active and mellow Im your guy! \nWe love inquiries and questions through Petfinder but we receive so many is impossible for us to answer, the best way to contact us is visiting our website. There you can find an explanation of the adoption process/ fees /requirements and you can follow a link to fill an adoption application. Thanks!  Www.RociosRescues.org\nThanks for wanting to make a rescue dog a part of your family!!",

            "description": "Meet Prince! He's a goofy, loveable two-ish year old boy who is eager to play. He's a silly boy who has had a rough go of his early life. Shelter records prior to his arrival at Fur Angels indicate he may have been part of a cruelty investigation. After lots of TLC in the shelter and even more in foster, Prince is learning that people can be trusted and that life can be a lot of good, silly fun. Prince shies away from loud noises and has some anxiety that is manageable with Trazadone as needed. He is also crate trained and will take space in his crate when things get too chaotic for him. He is skittish and slow to warm up to new people, but once he does, it's game on and time to snuggle and play! Prince loves spending time in his fosters' home office and is always nearby. He loves napping with the humans and will happily cuddle up on the bed for a good snooze. He loves any toy he can chew, tear, or shred and is especially fond of squeaky toys. Treats are always welcome for this guy, and he is intelligent and loves training, though he can be easily distracted. Prince loves to play in the backyard and to go for walks and runs, and he would love a good running buddy or hiking pal as much as he would love to loaf around and be a home body. Prince enjoys the company of large dogs and/or young dogs the most but does well with energetic, friendly smaller pups as well. He does well with his foster sibling kitties who are quite familiar with large, curious dogs, but he may be too curious and playful for a kitty that's easily startled or fearful of dogs. He is working on his basic manners and will need a home where his people will help him develop into the best dog he can be (and we know he can be great!). Prince has an adoption fee of $250.00. Check him out at furangelsas.com/adopt today!",

She is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4498990.\n\nIsn't Joni pretty? She's been at the shelter for more than 60 days now and she'd love to find her furever home. Joni is shy when she sees people that she doesn't know and that could be why she hasn't found her perfect home yet. She gets scared when the shelter staff tries to leash her but once she's on the leash, she loves to get out of her kennel to walk or go to the play yard. Once she gets out to the yard, she loves to do the zoomies and play. And, once she gets to know you, she will come to you for affection and pets with her tail wagging.\n\nJoni needs an adopter that understands that it's going to take a while for her to get comfortable in a new home with people that she doesn't know. If you can give Joni the time, patience and loving home that she needs, then come and meet her today!! Please bring any dogs that you already have at home to come and meet her too.\n\nIf you are interested in saving this pet, please reach out via this link: https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/foster/BPAZ/Dog\n\nTo actually visit with this pup, please make an appointment here: https://mcaccappointments.as.me/adopt. NOTE: People who sign up for these appointments often no-show, and we have seen that you can generally show up and let them know you are there to meet this particular dog and the shelter will squeeze you in, except from 12-3PM or closer to the 6PM closing time. (Please know this is not a guarantee). If the dog is at risk, please ask for a supervisor to meet that particular dog.\n\n*Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG. MCACC is located at 2500 S. 27th Avenue, Phoenix. Different adoption fees/policy may apply. Please visit MCACC's website http://www.maricopa.gov/pets/locations.aspx for hours. You may also wish to call 602-506-7387 (PETS) and provide the animal's A# above to verify is still available.",

Her brother looks very pitty, but Jersey looks very very lab. We almost aren't sure if they are related! Jersey is 25 pounds and we expect her to be 35-45 pounds full grown. She is a very happy girl doing very well with her puppy manners. She has been working on her potty training and is doing fantastic! She is working on crate training, leash training, and all the fun stuff. She is a very smart girl!! She is social with kids and other dogs. She does chase cats. \n\n If interested in sweet Jersey please send in an application as the first step towards adoption www.soardogs.org \n\nAdoption donation required. This covers altering, DAP series vaccinations to date of adoption, Bordetella Vaccination, Rabies vaccination if over four months, Microchip, Deworming, heartworm test (if over 8 months), monthly flea/heartworm prevention to date, grooming, full veterinary examination, and temperament evaluation. Please e-mail us for more information or go to our website https://soardogs.org/adoption-application for an application. Thank you very much!\u00a0\n\n\nAll SOAR dogs go through a ten-day quarantine period to ensure they are healthy, before being adopted. We do not operate on a first come first serve basis, but screen applicants in order to find the best fit for our adoptable dogs.",

Please consider opening your heart and home to this precious little boy. Gosling is recovering from Mange he has been treated snd once his hair grows back he is going to be a gorgeous boy!!\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, rabies (if puppy is old enough), distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing (if puppy is old enough), monthly heartworm prevention while in our care, monthly flea/tick prevention while in our care, and our transport costs. As part of the adoption agreement, adopters agree to get the pup spayed/neutered and provide K-9 Lifesavers with proof of spay/neuter. K-9 Lifesavers does not cover the cost of spay/neuter for puppies 6 months or younger.\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\nHelp Save Lives! Make a tax-deductible donation today and help save a life. Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support! We are all volunteer based organization so every cent from your donation goes directly to the dogs in our care.\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\nCheck out our social media!

            "description": "No longer accepting applications.\n\nAnimal Profile: Betty, also goes by Bear arrived in Seattle on 5/17 from California. She is estimated to be 1 year old and weighs 50 lbs. She was surrendered to a high kill shelter in California with four other dogs. The owners said all four dogs were outside only dogs. Our volunteer transporter reports that Betty is shy and overwhelmed but does better once outside the kennel environment. She is interested in things and will welcome attention from people. Seattle\n\nFoster Update: Bear actually found a home but unfortunately was returned back to us due to no fault of her own. She takes some time to warm up, but then is the sweetest girl. She will give kisses sometimes and when she's comfortable with you she is very treat motivated. She is crate trained and is most comfortable in her crate when she isn't sure what to do or nervous. She knows \"go home\" means go to her crate. She is perfect on a leash and doesn't pull. She knows sit, shake, \"bump it\" (I make a fist and she bumps it with her nose). She is fully potty trained, she has the best inside manners, and chill throughout the day. She is respectful of the inside and boundaries. She isn't allowed in the kitchen or bathroom and I've never had an issue with her testing it. She doesn't fetch yet but loves to chase the resident dog and toys in the yard. She enjoys laying out in the front yard and sunbathing. She is getting more and more comfortable out and around people but still is reserved and doesn't enjoy a lot of attention. It just takes time with her and the more positive experiences she has with people the more comfortable she'll become. She does great with the resident dog after they had a chance to get to know each other so slow introductions are a must.\n\nBetty's ideal home will be someone who has previous dog experience, no small kids, is active, is willing to continue her training and will be patient with her. she requires a stable home.\n\nAdoption Info: Adoption fee is $500 which includes spay/neuter, all core vaccinations, microchip, heartworm test and health certificate. Your adoption fee may be tax deductible as Dog Gone Seattle is a federal 501c3 organization. Apply online: www.doggoneseattle.org/adoption-application",

Approximately 1-1/2 years old, and because she was mistreated by being made to live\nin a crate for most of her life, her hind legs did not develop properly.\nWhen we received her the hind legs were crippled up but she was determined to walk! Now that she has been in a foster home and free to roam the house and yard, her legs are improving. She lives with other dogs and does fine but, understandably, is very leary of humans until she gets to know you - which sometimes is quite quickly, other times she keeps her distance. She would do best with a quiet home that will give her love and exercise. She is not trusting of children and we think kids were mean to her as a puppy. Very sad past but she has the ability to be a wonderful pet for someone who will take the time with her.\" NalaLee is housetrained and good on a leash.\n\nAdoption fee includes spay/neuter, microchip and rabies and other core vaccinations.",

What Maggie lacks in front teeth (due to chewing on a chain) she makes up for in smiles and cuddles for her humans; wanting nothing more than to be with her family as much as possible. Lower energy (but still very young so able to get up and go when the urge hits her), Maggie's favorite hobbies include napping in a sunny spot on the floor, napping on a soft spot on the couch, napping with her humans, barking at birds in the backyard, and eating all the snacks she can get.\n\nMaggie is potty trained, spayed, up to date on all her vaccines, and heartworm negative. She has not been cat tested, but does well with other friendly dogs after a slow 3 to 5 day crate and rotate introduction period (as her way of \"talking\" when she is super happy sounds a bit like a growl and can confuse brand new dogs that don't know her).\n\nMaggie LOVES children, but would be just as happy with ANY kind of family that is ready to make her a priority and one of their own!\n",

He is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4497475.\n\nLook at that big smile on Johnny's face. He's still smiling even though he's been at the shelter for more than 60 days now and he's ready to go home! All of the volunteers that have taken Johnny out for a walk say he is fun to walk. He pulls a bit when he first gets out of his kennel because he's so happy to get going but once he starts walking, he slows down and takes in his surroundings. He loves his treats and will \"sit\" and \"shake\" for them. He even knows how to \"high five\"!! He recently went out for the day with a foster and they said he did great. He rides well in the car and went to the park to burn off some energy. He got a hamburger treat to end his great day out. His foster says he is a fun, confident boy. And, he's potty trained!!\n\nJohnny has reacted to other dogs in the shelter so if you have another dog at home, please bring them with you to meet him. Johnny would love to go home soon. Please come and meet him today!!\n\nIf you are interested in saving this pet, please reach out via this link: https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/foster/BPAZ/Dog\n\nTo actually visit with this pup, please make an appointment here: https://mcaccappointments.as.me/adopt. NOTE: People who sign up for these appointments often no-show, and we have seen that you can generally show up and let them know you are there to meet this particular dog and the shelter will squeeze you in, except from 12-3PM or closer to the 6PM closing time. (Please know this is not a guarantee). If the dog is at risk, please ask for a supervisor to meet that particular dog.\n\n*Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG. MCACC is located at 2500 S. 27th Avenue, Phoenix. Different adoption fees/policy may apply. Please visit MCACC's website http://www.maricopa.gov/pets/locations.aspx for hours. You may also wish to call 602-506-7387 (PETS) and provide the animal's A# above to verify is still available.",

She is a little bit shy and submissive at times, but after she gets comfortable, she is a very lovey and affectionate girl. She is the type of dog who would love to sit on the couch at home with you and take a nap. She would do best in a home with older children and no other animals. Chata does not do well with other dogs so she cannot be taken to dog parks or doggy daycare. Chata would be good in an apartment since she does not require a lot of exercise, but she will still enjoy daily walks. Chata is doing a two week board and train with Dogtown Pet Spa and will know all of her basic commands, how to walk nicely on a leash, and how to be calm in a kennel",

We suspect he was thrown in there and probably suffered from abuse. A person heard him crying and DRWB went to his rescue. Poor Sam was in bones, very hungry and afraid.\n\nSince his rescue he was transferred to a loving foster parent that owns a few cats, a senior golden retriever and a senior poodle. Sam has bonded with the golden retriever, even sleeps with her!\n\nSam is very timid, which is totally understandable given that he was the victim of abuse and the time in the ditch caused him to be afraid. Despite all of this Sam likes humans, he is not a biter and has never attempted to bite anyone; on the contrary, he is very passive and cowards when he feels he is in danger.\n\nSam needs a family that will give him lots of love, patience, and show him that this world can be a better place; he just needs to build confidence in himself and in humanity. He is a sweet boy that only wants to be loved, he enjoys cuddling with his foster parent, and sitting by her side to watch TV. He is not a barker.\n\nSam requires a calm environment, a secure place with no openings or easy escape, he will probably try to run away the first few days after moving to a new home. But he will adjust and learn to trust his new human. A home with another sweet dog would be a big plus.\n\nWe don't recommend Sam going to a home with children, as he is afraid of loud noises and abrupt moves.\n\nHe will need to learn to walk on leash and get used to traffic noises.\n\nThis boy just needs a chance to thrive. He is a true gem, he only needs love to work its magic for him to come out of his shell and leave behind all of the bad memories and experiences he suffered at a very young age.\n\nPLEASE only serious and experienced dog owners.",

This just means she can't be too active until they are gone, but she doesn't mind the couch potato life one bit!\n\nWe're sure once you meet Olive she will have you saying \"Olive you too!\"",

She loves to play and is extremely intuitive.  If you are active and need a buddy, she is your gal!  If you already have a dog \u2013 then she is not for you.  She needs to be the ONLY pet.  She will be a great family dog, but needs to be the only family pet.  Trust us, you will not regret only having her as she will form a bond that will be unbreakable!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Creek, please email sln2310@yahoo.com and request an application. Once your application has been received and reviewed, you will be contacted via email or phone by one of our volunteers. After your application is approved, the foster parent for the dog you have selected will contact you to answer any questions you may have and determine if that dog is a good match for your family. \nIf you have no particular dog in mind, we will be happy to keep your application on file and notify you if the right dog should come into rescue. Catahoula Rescue of New England is an all-volunteer group. Dogs in our program are fostered by volunteers. The foster homes care for our dogs as if they were their own. All dogs have received vaccinations appropriate to age and are spayed or neutered. \nCreek\u2019s adoption donation is $400 which includes Rabies, DHLPP, Bordetella, fecal test, heartworm test when appropriate and is on preventative, microchip, and neuter. We do not have a physical shelter, all of our dogs are fostered in individual foster homes across the New England and Canada.\n",

I have a pretty sad backstory, but none of that matters anymore. New life. New name. New me!! I was pretty lost and alone and not sure how to handle the good life, so the good people of SSOMN sent me to learn the basics (and then some!) at Premier K9 Center of Minnesota. I learned to be nice to strangers, that kitties are not for eating and that I have to tolerate other dogs. But all that aside, I'd rather have a home to myself. No dogs. No cats and No small humans. Just me and my human to play and cuddle up at night. Rocky is a stubborn 3 1/2 year old neutered male. He is up to date on vaccines and heartworm negative. He has completed intense rehabilitation training and is hanging out in his foster home until his forever family finds him. He will require significant breed experience and a strong handler to remind him he doesn't make the rules. If you think he might be your guy, you can submit an adoption application here: https://www.savingshepherdsofmn.org/info/adoption",

He does great with cats, is house/crate trained and just loves to be with his people.  ADOPT HIM!!\n\nIf interested you must complete the application on our website: shelterfriends.org\n\nHis adoption fee includes: neuter, vaccines, deworming and microchip.\n\n**NOTE** DO NOT EMAIL US QUESTIONS, IT'LL BE DELETED SINCE OUR RESCUE IS RAN BY VOLUNTEERS.

He\u2019s right there with our top \u2018most photogenic\u2019 dogs and photographs beautifully.    His coloration resembles a Doberman but his size, build and temperament reflect that of an ACD.   Dash is up-to-date on all medical and is an extremely handsome fellow.    We know with a little time and attention, this fellow will make the right person a loving, smart and attentive pet.     Dash was surrendered because of his high energy level and the time and attention he requires and deserves.   While he loves to play ball and frisbee, he doesn\u2019t care to return them or bring them back to you.  \n\nThis 15 month old dog has been in two households and his energy level outlasted his owners.    He needs a family who can provide him exercise BOTH during a normal routine day AND while the owner is otherwise occupied.    He absolutely requires a fenced in yard and preferably another high energy companion pet. \n\nDash walks well on the leash and, while a little timid and hesitant initially with new people; he warms up quickly allowing you to handle his mouth, ears and feet.    He\u2019s good with the veterinarian, children and other dogs but is an unknown with cats.\n\nGo on line to https://www.godbeycreekcaninerescue.org to complete an application for Dash.    To schedule an appointment to meet this handsome hound or for more information, contact skylara@godbeycreekcaninerescue.org, mariamw@godbeycreekcaninerescue.org OR phone 336.972.4511.",

She is in a foster home with a male and a female Doberman and she gets along with both and plays nicely with them.  She was previously in a home with 2 small, elderly dogs and she was snappy with one of them, so her owners turned her in for fear she'd hurt one of the little dogs. \n\nDella needs regular exercise.  She would do well in an active home.  She is very well behaved indoors.  She is crate trained but does not need to be crated when left alone.  She is obedient.  She has shown no toy or food possessiveness. \n\nDella has been spayed, microchipped and is fully vaccinated.  Her adoption fee is $300.",

We need someone with no other dogs or with a male dog, and someone who owns their home so we do not have to worry about breed issues with a rental.\n\nRayla is a sweet girl! She is around 2 years old. She is happiest when sleeping on the couch with her people and getting belly rubs. She has been through a lot of trauma recently, with the death of her human and going into rescue. She is adjusting well and has been mostly tail wags and smiles. She would prefer to be with someone who is home a lot or able to take her with them on their adventures. She loves all people she meets but has not been around kids. She has never shown any aggression to people and loves everyone that meets her. She is learning her doggy social skills. She likes to play with goofy boys. She could get along with a goofy or chill male dog with proper SLOW introductions. She would be totally fine being the one and only center of attention too. It was said that she spent her nights, sharing a pillow with her human. Rayla has not been cat tested. She is learning her basic obedience and leash skills. Crate trained and house broken. Rayla is going to be an amazing companion for someone who wants company. She is so loving and her presence is delightful! \n\nRayla is fully vetted. We are working on loosing a couple of of pounds now. \n\nPlease inquire by submitting an application to jaime@threelittlepittiesrescue.org\n\nApplication link: https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/21733/generic\n\nPlease go to our website to see more about our rescue and what we do! We are very proud of our hard work in saving as many animals as we can, giving them what they need, and matching them with the right families.",

Ski recently had some stitches removed and is loving that she is now allowed to run and chase her toys. She loves to play for a while or go for a walk and then take a long nap on her dog bed or the couch.\n\nSki is new to living as part of a family. She is gradually gaining confidence and learning that she does not need to be afraid of new sounds or experiences. When she is frightened, she usually hides behind people that she trusts, or barks. She needs someone with the time and patience to train her.\n\nSki is making great progress with house training. She does her business whenever we take her out, but so far, she does not ask to go out. In foster care, we have been taking her out every 3 hours or so and she has been doing great on this schedule.\n\nFill out an adoption application to schedule your own private meet and greet with this furry friend.\n\nFollow us on Facebook for additional updates and sneak peeks of new dogs! https://www.facebook.com/reachrescue",

After a few days we realized something may be causing him discomfort in his hips. After xrays we found out he had a shattered pelvis. The doctor couldn't believe he was even walking. Even through all of that pain he just wanted comfort and love. After seeing a specialist it was determined his breaks were too healed to do anything about, except pain management and rehabilitation. \nTad will be starting rehab soon. He may need it for 4-6 months. He is 1-2 years old. He's good with other dogs and cats. Older children in the home would be best. He's learning to be kenneled and to go potty on pads between potty breaks. Now that he isn't in pain he tries to play with the other dogs in the home. He loves to snuggle in bed. When you stop petting him he'll growl toward you for your attention or gently grab your hand with his mouth to keep petting him. He gets excited to greet you when you come home and will cry and bark and paw at the back of your legs to let you know how happy he is you have returned. He loves car rides and walks. He has also gained some weight and doesn't look so emaciated.",

I am here because The Animal Pad rescued me from a shelter in Ensenada called Ellos Son La Razon. Currently, I am working on potty training and leash training, I just have a few accidents here and there that my foster is helping me out with. I dont have leash training yet, but I am also working on it! Maybe you can lend a paw?\n\nI am very shy and timid and with help from my foster mama and my doggie sibling, I have bloomed! I have even started to cuddle on the bed and it makes her so happy! My foster believes its because I had an abusive past getting bullied. Even though I require a lot of time and patience for me to trust you...I just want love all day every day. Ill even whine when you stop petting me. My favorite activity is getting lots of belly rubs. But Im also a huge sucker for treats!! I am doggo and little hooman friendly. If you're willing to put in the time, then I am willing to put in my trust in you. Pinky Pawmise.\n\nMy perfect furever home would be a place where I have hoomans/big or small and definitely other doggos to bring out the dog I am. I adore being with other dogs! I have struggled with my past life but I would like to move on with a lot of patience and love. I will need some decompression time, but I do love fully once I trust. My adoption fee is $400 and that includes spaying/neutering, shots, and microchip. If you want to take me home, please fill out the form on the website here https://theanimalpad.org/adoption-application/",
