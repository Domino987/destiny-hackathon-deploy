            "description": "Things did not work out for Theodore in his adopted home, so we welcomed him back to Rescue Row with open arms. Once a Rescue Row dog, always a Rescue Row dog. He is reactive and will bite, but when taught by every member of the family that this behavior in unacceptable, he has no issues. Theodore is looking for a small family with no young children that has had experience with a dog with similar issues and is willing to work on modifying his behavior. He is a 4 year old Shorkie (Shih Tzu/Yorkie Mix). Applications can be found at RescueRowInc.org\n\nTheodore joined Rescue Row after a horrific attack by a larger dog. We are not sure how he did not sustain more serious injuries other than multiple surface wounds and a few punctures. On top of having wounds covering the backend of his body, he had mats everywhere preventing us from cleaning out his injuries properly. After being shaved down, we were able to clean out the wounds and assess the damage. He is in very good spirits and is resting and eating and drinking well. Theodore is a 3 year old Shorkie (Shitzu/Yorkie mix). Theo would do best in a home without children becuase sudden movements startle him. He also needs a home with another dog that he can play with and someone that can continue with his daily walks!\n\nIf you would like to adopt a dog from Rescue Row please fill out an application at https://form.jotform.com/91767055990166 \n\n*Please check your junk email folder if you do not receive a response from a Rescue Row member within 48 hours.\n\n*You must live within an hour of the DFW Metroplex because we do trial adoptions and require a homecheck\n\n*Our adoption fees are as follows (paid by cash or a check made out to Rescue Row):\n\n Dogs 12 weeks-6 months old: $300 adoption fee\n\n Dogs 7 months and older: $275 adoption fee\n\nRescue Row is a 501(c)3 (non-profit) all volunteer dog rescue organization serving the DFW Metroplex. We are dedicated to rescuing dogs in shelters, dogs in abusive or neglectful situations, and dogs surrendered by their owners because of difficult circumstances. We place dogs in loving, responsible, committed permanent homes, following a comprehensive adoption process, which includes taking considerable care in finding good matches and educating prospective adopters about the responsibilities and costs of bringing a dog into their homes and lives. Dogs in our care are spayed or neutered, microchipped, receive all appropriate veterinary care and treatment, and placed in nurturing foster homes while they await placement in their permanent homes. We assist dogs in distress without regard to age, breed or ease of placement. Dogs in the greatest need take priority. Finally, we strive to work with shelters and other rescue and humane organizations to develop a network of supporters and volunteers in order to create a better world for homeless dogs.",

She's been frightened at the changes in her life but is now warming up while receiving gentle loving care in a comfortable foster home. She's ADORABLE in both looks and personalityshe'll mesmerize you with her beautiful, big brown eyes. She loves to give kisses and wag her tail, and she's a champion snuggler. She has a sweet disposition, and is well-behaved and is good with other pups.\nIt is felt that Mystic would do best in a home with no small children. If you're looking for a precious companion to share all good things in life with, please submit an adoption application for Mystic.

            "description": "Meet Rosebud. This sweet bully girl was surrendered to the rescue when her owners moved to a community that did not allow \"Pit Bulls.\" Rosebud's owners rescued her from a family who wasn't taking great care of her and keeping her outside. They loved and cared for her, and she was up to date on her vet care when we took her in...something we don't often see. They are an older couple, and the husband was dealing with health issues, so she wasn't getting the amount of daily exercise a young Bully girl needs to stay fit and healthy. She was also a bit spoiled from eating table scraps and has gotten a little thick around the middle.\n\nRosebud is currently in a SC foster home with one of our favorite families, Laine, Gary, and their pack of four pups. She is housetrained and crate trained, and does well with the other dogs. She prefers dogs who are more laid back, and her BFF is Mr. Charles, their dapper senior Boxer mix. She is not a fan of hyper pups who get in her face or try to take her toys, but do you blame her? Rosebud will hang out and sleep with the pack but is not super playful. That's just not her MO. She does like to fetch, but her favorite things include morning snuggles with Gary when she sneaks into bed, daily walks through the woods, chasing small critters while sniffing around the yard, and she loves sunbathing on the back deck.\n\nLaine describes Rosebud as having a moderate energy level and some mild separation anxiety. Initially, she was anxious about being left alone and would bark/whine and try to get out of her crate. Now, she will whine but has earned free roam privileges in the home. She's respectful of things in the home and would do well with a good couch to nap on.\n\nRosebud is very friendly and loves to be near her people. She greets new people well and likes men and women equally. We feel a family with another mellow dog and a flexible work schedule would be the best fit for her. We also want to see Rosebud go to an active family who will make sure she gets daily walks and help her trim down to a healthier weight. Rosebud is still a young dog who is very connected to her people and has so much love to give.\n\nThis pretty Bully girl is ready to start her new life. Apply today!\n\nPreference will be given to...\n\nFamilies with another calm dog in the home\n\nOwners with bully o\nr large dog experience\nFlexible schedule\nNO CATS\n\nBREED ESTIMATE: AmStaff (Bully) mix\nGENDER: Male\nAPPROXIMATE WEIGHT: 62-64lbs\nAPPROXIMATE AGE: ~ 3 years\nCOAT TYPE: short\nADOPTION FEE: $400\nOTHER INFO: utd on shots/spayed/microchipped\nLOCATION: Sterling, VA\n\nFOR MORE INFO OR TO ADOPT: Please go to https://adopt.worthydog.org and complete the application.\n\nYou can also help save dogs like this one by becoming a foster, providing a rescue dog with a temporary home and giving them the love and care they need until they are permanently adopted. Every person who fosters is directly responsible for saving the life of a dog, because we can only save as many dogs as we have foster families available to welcome them into their homes. If you think you might be interested in becoming a foster and want to learn more, please go to https://foster.worthydog.org and fill out an application.\n\nWorthy Dog Rescue is an all-volunteer, foster-based rescue that primarily adopts to families in the DC Metro area.\n2/2/21 11:48 AM",

            "description": "Meet Bea! Born in May 2018, Bea is a miniature poodle mix seeking a special forever home. Bea\u2019s foster mom describes her as a very shy girl who is still learning to be a real dog. After about a month in her foster home, her playful side really started to show with the other dogs but she is still learning to fully trust humans. Bea MUST have a home with other sweet tempered dogs who can engage in play with Bea. At least 1 other dog is required, but in Bea\u2019s eyes, the more the merrier. She is currently fostered with other dogs of all sizes and cats but prefers the dogs with gentler souls in the home. Bea would do best in a home with gentle kids over 12. Her home will require a securely fenced yard as she still needs work on her leash skills and she likes to try to escape when left alone. Bea has bonded quickly with her foster parents but does get nervous when guests come over, so a quiet home would be best. Bea is not crate trained but does well with free roam of the house and is working on her potty training still because life inside a home seems to be a new experience for her. Bea\u2019s forever family MUST be patient as it will take her weeks to adjust to a new family. After almost 3 months in her foster home she still startles very easily at loud noises, loud voices, etc. She does tend to try to hide and run away when left alone with new people. If she should get loose out an open door or through a fence, Bea will be difficult to catch again. ***Only dog homes, apartments, and families with children under 12 will NOT be considered. Applications for this sweet girl can be completed at www.mikeyschance.com.\n\nNo children under 5. \n\nLike all Mikey's Chance dogs, this dog will come to you from a foster home that has provided loving one-on-one attention, socialization and some basic training, as well as quality food and exercise. \n\nApplications can be found at www.mikeyschance.com and completed on a computer, tablet, and/or phone. Please note that adopters are not chosen on a first come, first served basis, but full consideration is given to the best fit for the dog AND the adopter. Applications can take up to 3 weeks to process. Application submission DOES NOT guarantee approval for adoption.",

She will not be a dog park dog, but has learned how to play well with others in her current foster pack. Mayven is on the medium to low energy wise, and has learned how to connect with her human and follow their lead. She is very sweet, and enjoys well earned affection from her human. She is currently almost fully recovered from a skin infection, and is a chunky burrito. Mayven's future home will be able to reinforce boundaries, understand the importance of the use of \"place\", and will not be looking for a social pawn to take to Mutts or the dog park. She can be a bit pushy, and hardheaded. Her new home will also understand that it takes more than just love and affection to make a dog good. She will be a great addition to a well mannered dog pack that knows how to play and knows when to chill.",

            "description": "STELLA\nChihuahua\n(DOB: 10/19/16)\n\nMiss Stella was turned into the shelter because her owners said she had no quality of life being overweight with skin issues. DITR took her in and she\u2019s already down from 11 lbs to 8.10 lbs. and on her way to being a healthy weight. She loves to walk! Exercise and a good diet does a body good. \n\nShe is 4 years young and full of spunk.\n\nStella is sweet as sugar, but oddly has an issue with being picked up. She is getting better but it takes several tries of getting her to come close enough for her foster mom to pick her up!! She does love to be held or to sit in your lap! \nShe loves the other dogs but is an attention hog and fusses at everyone for trying to sit with foster mom! Stella is totally house-trained and sleeps well in her calming bed all night without being crated. She is so precious!!\n\nStella is up-to-date on vaccines, spayed, microchipped and being maintained on monthly heartworm and flea/tick prevention. \n\nStella would do well in a home with possibly 1 other dog, but she would probably like to have a house all to herself!\n\nThis dog is currently being fostered as part of Diamonds in the Ruff Canine Rescue. An application is required, along with a home visit and small adoption fee.  Applicants must be at least 21 years of age. **FENCED IN YARD REQUIRED**\n\nPlease visit us on our Facebook page for additional photos, give us a like while you're there! \nhttps://www.facebook.com/diamondsintheruffNC\n\nAll of our dogs are fostered in homes and are INDOOR dogs. We believe all dogs are family members and should be treated as valued members of the household. \n\nPlease review our adoption guidelines for further information on adopting from Diamonds in the Ruff Canine Rescue before submitting an application. www.DITRnc.com.\n\n\n.",

Found as a stray in Alabama, he had to have surgery on his hip to remove the femoral head (the \"ball\" part that fits in the hip socket).The good news of surgery is that he is all healed and that relieved his pain. He'll never be a long distance running partner but he loves his walks, playtime, and all those fun dog activities just like any other dog.Boxer is well mannered, housetrained on a schedule, and crates well. He is about 5 years old, 60 lbs so past those obnoxious puppy stages. He gets along great with other dogs, fine with cat, and loves kids. He is a total snuggle bug and loves to curl up with other dogs or people. Boxer is an easy dog to lose your heart to, he's just such a good boy. He was heartworm positive and has been treated,\n\nBoxer was positive for heartworm disease and has recently been treated. More information on heartworm and treatment can be found here: http://headinghomek9rescue.com/Heartworm.pdf\n\nRequirements: Home with yard space. \n\nAdoption Fee: $450 + tax. This includes neuter/spay, current vaccinations as age appropriate, heartworm/tick testing if appropriate, deworming, microchip, and current preventatives\n\nInterested in adopting?  Fill out a preadopt application here: https://form.jotform.com/203104997748162\n\nYou can email fostersheadinghomek9@gmail.com with additional questions.\n\nThis dog is located in Minneapolis, MN",

I'm a giant love lovebug and I would really love it if I could find an experienced Malamute owner who understands my high energy level, love of the great outdoors, and specific grooming needs. I love to play with other big dogs like myself and due to my high energy level, and I think I would really enjoy living in a family with young children. I don't appear to have much of a prey drive so I may be able to live in a home with some feline companions. I absolutely need to have a big yard space to run around and play in to help me burn some of my endless energy. I think I could be happy living in either a busy or a quiet household, as long as we get plenty of visitors because super friendly. I think I would enjoy going out and about with you, if you'll have me. I appear to be well-trained, however I may not be completely potty trained, and I love to go for nice long leashed walks!",

IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN APPLYING TO ADOPT, PLEASE DO NOT REPLY VIA PETFINDER, INSTEAD GO TO  www.arizonapoodlerescue.org TO THE \u201cAdopt Me\u201d SECTION TO FIND OUR ONLINE APPLICATION.  WE WILL NOT ADOPT OUR DOGS OUT OF STATE.   PLEASE RESPECT OUR PROCESS AND OUR TIME AS WE ARE ALL VOLUNTEERS.  WE WILL BE GLAD TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS DOG ONCE WE HAVE AN APPLICATION IN HAND.  PLEASE NO PHONE CALLS! \n\n Mitchell is a 14-year-old black mini poodle mix and Snickers is a 7-year-old apricot terrier mix. They are a bonded pair whose owner passed away. The boys came to us rather obese, Mitchell was 25 lbs and Snickers 35 lbs. They have been working on their weight with a good diet and exercise. They have dropped quite a few pounds already. These two boys are rarely far apart. Snickers loves to play with other dogs and Mitchell will watch. Mitchell takes an OTC joint supplement and is still on a diet. Snickers wants to play and loves attention. He loves to follow his foster mom around He too is still on a diet. Snickers sheds some. The boys are working on their housebreaking, but do well if let out regularly.  They like to talk at dinner time, \"hurry up with the food we are hungry\". They enjoy sleeping together at night. Both boys are affectionate and social and happy to greet anyone. The boys need to go to a home together. There must already be a playful dog in the home. The boys get along great with people and other dogs.\n\nThere is an application and possible home visit or reference check prior to adoption.   Applications can be found on our website www.arizonapoodlerescue.org.   Click on the \"Adopt Me\" tab.    Snickers and Mitchell are being fostered in Phoenix.  Their adoption fee is $300 for the pair.\n\nArizona Poodle Rescue is an all volunteer non-profit organization.  We do not have a shelter.  Our dogs are currently being fostered in private homes generally located in the Phoenix and Tucson area.",

He's a smallish 7-year-old fawn male who presented to us as shy and insecure, but apparently that all changes when he is confronted with another dog close by on leash. This was likely the root of the problem at his home: when he behaves aggressively toward another dog he may \"redirect\" his aggression at his owner or whoever is walking him. It seems that the simplest answer would be to make sure he gets plenty of exercise and stimulation at home in his yard, but perhaps that wasn't an option for his owners, and since he's somewhat overprotective of his home and owners anyway, it might preclude his success in a home with many visitors as well. On the plus side, Boogie is housebroken, and good with cats as well as kids, though once again we'd be concerned that kids typically have friends over and Bookie might or might not be ok with that. Ideally, especially at his early-senior age, he would be best paired with an older person or couple, perhaps retirees, who mostly keep their own company and enjoy having a lovable house dog to spend relaxing time with.",

            "description": "Lipton, 9 month old pup. 50 lbs. Needs a home with a yard.\n\nMeet Lipton! This awesome boy will fill your days with joy. He is an affectionate dog who loves to play, run, hike and keep you company in whatever you are doing.\n\nHe is young pup and explores the world with his mouth so appropriate chewing toys must be available to him. He is a little timid on busy streets so we prefer to see him in a more quiet area rather than a busy city area. He gets along with all people but needs a bit more time to warm up to men.\n\nLipton can guard his toys and food which is something that needs work. We have him in boarding at the moment and working with a trainer so he can learn and improve. A committed owner who is willing to learn these skills and continue to work with him will be crucial to set him up for success. Since he also guards his food and toys from other dogs, Lipton will be best as an only dog. We prefer to see him in a home without kids.\n\nLipton knows basic commands. He sits very well. Learning to \"stay\" and \"leave it.\" He plays very well with other dogs but can play hard which some dogs don't appreciate.\n\nHe walks well on a leash.\n\nHe is extremely loving and loves to give kisses. He is crate trained and will let you know if he needs to go potty.\n\nLipton needs an active family with a fenced backyard.\n\nHe is vaccinated, chipped and neutered. His adoption fee is $495.\n\nWe cover the medical to prepare the pet for adoption and the adopt donations go directly to cover those costs and range from $295-$495. Thank you for stepping up to save a life!\n\nTo expedite to meet with this dog, please go to our site at www.savinggreatanimals.org and fill out an application. We look at the first applications to arrive, so we hope to hear from you soon!",

The circumstances were not known, but Jack grazed the family's 14-year-old daughter near her eyebrow. It was not a bite and he was not quarantined. When he was surrendered to their local animal control, the officer apprehending him also reported a negative experience where the dog seemed fractious and defensive, but we feel this behavior would be fairly normal under the circumstances. The animal control facility employees became well acquainted with Jack during his stay there, and they found him to be a good dog who appears to prefer women. He's 4 years old and has the solid build typical of European breeding lines. It was mentioned that he likely would not do well with other male dogs or small animals, and we're offering Jack for adoption only to an adult adopter, preferably a woman.",

He/She is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A448823.\n\nBuck is a happy-go-lucky dude ready for his forever home. He seems happiest playing off leash in the play yard and would love his own backyard to romp around in. Buck is very smart and will enjoy some training with his new family. Buck is friendly with the staff and likes to go for walks. He's still a little unsure of the shelter and a bit skittish of traffic noises, so he will benefit from some socialization adventures with his new family. He can be a little wary of dogs he doesn't know, so bring Fido with you to the shelter for a meet and greet. if you're looking for a handsome young dog to join your family, look no further. Head on down to the shelter and give Buck a visit.\n\n*Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG. MCACC is located at 2500 S. 27th Avenue, Phoenix. Different adoption fees/policy may apply. Please visit MCACC's website http://www.maricopa.gov/pets/locations.aspx for hours.

She was suffering from extreme malnutrition but has since achieved a healthy weight while in foster care. She now becomes very talkative if her foster mom is late with dinner! Hope lives in a foster home with other Great Danes and she interacts nicely with them - although she does not put up with any nonsense from the energetic younger Great Danes.\nHope did test positive for ehrlichia which is a bacteria infection caused by a tick bite and she completed a 30-day course of doxycycline.\nPlease understand you are committing to providing a good home for her entire life (up to 15+ years or more.)\nYou must be committed to housebreaking, age-appropriate enrichment and exercise, leash training, grooming needs, and positive socialization.\nHer adoption fee is $250.

She has been doing great in her foster home. She is housebroken and working on her walking skills. Lila is a little shy at first and would benefit from a home with calm older children. Lila is also dog selective. This means some dogs she is amazing with and others shes not too sure about. Do you feel like you are the perfect person for this amazing girl?\n\nPuppies have special needs and require a home where there will be someone available to care for, socialize, and train them during the day. If your family is away from the home for several hours at a time, please consider adopting a teenager or adult dog.\n\nOur standard adoption fees are as follows $400 for puppies up to 12 months, $300 for adults, and $200 for seniors 7yrs and up with cash or check. It includes spay/neuter, age appropriate vaccinations, fecal testing, deworming, flea and tick preventative, heartworm preventative, free vet visit at one of our participating vets, and micro-chipping.\n\nWe must have an application, conduct a phone interview, and meet your entire family to approve an adoption. Please visit www.rescuedrascalsil.org for an application. \n\nPlease note that the breeds and sizes posted in this biography are educated best guesses and are not guaranteed.",

He does pull moderately hard when walking on the leash and did pull towards the other dogs, but when he was walked around the play yard, he softened and was better with greeting other dogs. He is very smart and treat motivated, so he is easy to train. But he be a bit grabby with them, so smaller kids probably wouldn't be a good idea.\n\nHe is wary of\n\nmen...but does seem to do well with women and well with people he knows.\n\nIf you would like to meet Chuck, please visit our website for our application www.underdogaz.com",

I initially came to the rescue over 100 pounds with two torn knees and I am now down to 47 pounds and the vet thinks that the low 40s would be an ideal goal weight.\n\nI likely have a little bit of basset hound in me which is why my ideal weight is in low 40s. I do need to stick to a strict diet of 600 calories a day until I reach my goal weight and then the calorie count can be readjusted if needed by the vet. I am prone to skin infections so I take an allergy supplement to help and the vet said baths with a medicated shampoo will also help keep infections at bay.\n\nI had both of my knees repaired with a TPLO procedure which means I have two new knees with screws and plates which is pretty cool!! Both of my knees were torn due to being obese. The vet said there is no reason why the replaced knees shouldn\u2019t last my entire life which is awesome news. And if it weren\u2019t for the scars, you wouldn\u2019t know my knees were replaced because I am very active and go for regular mile long walks several times a week.\n\nI would do best in a home with no other dogs (unsure on cats) and no small children. I get along with my foster brothers most of the time but I have tendencies to resource guard items from other dogs. I am the most docile dog around humans. I am also doggy door trained but I do not like to be crated.\n\nI love my foster home but I am looking forward to finding a forever home and hope you will want to meet me!",

            "description": "The best part of rescuing a dog is being able to provide a happy home for the imperfectly perfect souls of this world! To give the \"underdog\" a chance at a beautiful life. They sometimes come with the very best stories and make the very best companions. \n\nLet me introduce you to Beylita and her daugter, Lolita. They are two of the sweetest Chihuahua mixes- who weren't always that way. Due to their skin condition, they have run into not the nicest of people in the past and it took a while for these sweet girls to learn trust. They have been in an amazing foster home for the past few months learning what love is. What it is to always have full bellies, furry friends and hooman friends. Love is all around them now and they reciprocate it! These girls are now so amazing and loving, greeting you with bounces, tail wags, tongues out and bellies up! They look to be friends with everyone and every dog! A little timid at first but once they feel comfortable, it is all fun and love thereafter! They are fearless and love to be around dogs of all sizes, and are not afraid to give off a corrective growl toward another doggo when they feel uncomfortable. It never goes past that-- they just say \"give me space\" and trot along in the other direction, tail wagging! Now full of life and confidence, they can be yappy when excited but simmer down quickly. They are both crate and house trained and ready for a start to their new lives. Mom and daughter have lived all of their lives together and rely on eachother for comfort, so they will need to be adopted together. They are so tiny that two dogs is no different than having one-- double the love without taking up much more space! \n\nBeylita is estimated at 3 years of age and teeny tiny but a CHUNK, weighing in at 10 lbs! Her daughter is slightly bigger (also a chunky monkey), weighing in at approx 13 lbs. They both suffer from alopecia. We initially believed it was mange or some sort of skin infection but after medical treatment and different treatment approaches, we have learned that it is what it is. This is who they are and how they will always look-- nothing short of BEAUTIFUL! Convenia injections very temporarily make a difference. You will see some hair growth, but it quickly goes back to the adorable patchy look. It's very adorable, if you ask me! Beylita's chest and head are smooth like a baby's bottom! Their foster momma has also been working on nail trims and slowly cutting back at the overgrown nails they first started with-- huge progress!\n\nIf you are ready to fill your heart with so much love, please don't sleep on these two diamonds in the ruff! Apply here to bring them home https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/19764/generic or email cynthia@threelittlepittiesrescue.org if you have an application on file.\n\nTheir combined adoption fee is $900 and includes all vaccines (DHPP & booster, Bordatella, Rabies), spay microchip, multiple dewormings, heartworm treatment, flea and heartworm preventative with 2 month of heartworm preventative for each after adoption, a high quality nylon Martingale collar, a 30 day trial of pet insurance, and transport from TX to the PNW.\n\n**APPLICATION REQUIRED FOR A RESPONSE**",

            "description": "UPDATE: ZOEY WAS ADOPTED BUT NOW IS AVAILABLE AGAIN\n\nThis poor girl, she just doesn't know how to act in every situation, definitely has some social issues, and always needs time to adjust. We thought we had found the perfect humans for her - they gave her tons of time to adjust and tried to make it work and did slow intros. She was VERY comfortable and loving with them, and they loved her too! Unfortunately she just couldn't get comfy with their little dog and ended up hurting her pretty badly - the other pup had to have stitches and will be ok, but now we are just scratching our heads as to what home will be the perfect fit for Zoey.\n\nShe is currently in a foster home with 5 other huskies and a cat all allowed to wander at will when humans are home, and after time to meet / greet / adjust with very close supervision, she is ok with all these animals. But she seems to have had a fair amount of issues in homes with other animals, sometimes seemingly at random.\n\nShe either needs a home with no other pets, or a very experienced owner who is able to monitor closely and allow her to adjust slowly, and have patience and hope she is a good fit with the other pets! She just seems to be pretty selective with others, and we can't really figure out what the determining factor is :( Total derpy, goofy, lovable sweetheart with humans though!\n\n******* ORIGINAL BIO ********\n\nMeet Zoey - we traced her history, and she used to be Princess, who was found as a stray in the summer of 2018 and adopted from the county shelter (https://www.facebook.com/.../a.21202.../2072127552838875/...) - she was listed as a project dog then, and unfortunately it doesn't seem much has changed. From what we have been able to figure out, she has likely been in AT LEAST 6 different homes by now. Her age estimate is 6-8, but she still has quite a lot of energy!\n\nHer first night in a with us she was so skittish she barely allowed anyone to pet her and wanted to stay outside as long as she could - she acted petrified of the large dogs in the home. Next day, after receiving treats (she is SO food motivated!! Perfect for training!!), she warmed up a TON and has been wanting pets nonstop. Day 2 she was annoying the bigger dogs pretty nonstop barking at them and seeing how they would react to her and being pretty pesky overall - we are pretty sure this was just a total lack of socialization and no understanding of how you are supposed to make new friends! There is a small dog (11lbs) here as well and she has absolutely ignored him. A couple sniffs but hasn't barked at him once.\n\nWe are now onto Day 4 of Zoey with us, and she has had quite the transformation! Totally fine with the other big dogs, doesn't bark at them at all and wants nonstop love from humans - the problem is that with 6 dogs (and a cat) here she can't get the amount of attention and one-on-one training time she needs and deserves to thrive! She slept on the bedroom floor right next to the other dogs quietly through the night (though she does snore a tiny bit!) with no issues at all.  \n\nWe think her ideal home would be either as an only dog, with smaller dogs, or with one or two larger dogs coupled with an experienced owner who understands that her first few days anywhere are going to be an ADJUSTMENT! Once she opens up and warms up she is extremely sweet, but she desperately wants one place that is her own and after having been moved around so much, we think every time she is moved she is so stressed because she doesn't know where she belongs.\n\nThe original adopter who had her for 6 months stated that she lived in a home with a cat for that period of time, and that she had no aggression to the cat, but would chase here and there - not nonstop or relentlessly but that when the kitty ran, she would follow. If the cat swatted her she would accept correction.... there is a cat here that she has met and has had the same behavior. Runs up tail wagging to sniff curiously. Since the kitty is 13 and a grumpy old man, I would call her back every time and she would (with a little effort) pull herself away and come over with no aggression. Supervision still recommended!\nShe is going to need someone with patience to work with her! When she opens up she becomes extremely loving and snuggly and paws for pets even! But she clearly has some sort of trauma that is making it hard for her to trust instantly!\n\nPlease please let us know if you can help Zoey!",

            "description": "Emma is being foster in a loving home near Pennington, NJ. Her foster writes..\n\nEmma\nis adjusting well... I do think that she was never an indoor dog and everything thing inside is new to her.... She is very relaxed at home and seems to enjoy being in.... she is doing well in the crate but has figured out how to escape by pushing out the bottom layer, lol. We have kept her out of the crate for a few days for an hour or two and besides a few toilet paper rolls she has not chewed or disrupted much. You can see with each passing day she gets a little more comfortable but she is still very skittish when doing something for the first time. She has not had an accident inside and does her business on the leash within a few minutes of a brisk walk around the block.\n\nWe do notice that she much prefers the company of females. While she is daily warming up to me she absolutely LOVES Erin, she is MUCH more cautious around men. But everyday she is changing into a loving family pet.... but as you said when we started our foster she is adjusting well to a calm relaxed home\n\nEmma and her sister, Ellie, were found as strays by a couple of men who were working in a wooded area. Ellie was fully pregnant and in need of some help if she were to be able to nurse her pups properly and Emma seemed a bit hesitant of the two men. When the two men returned to the job site the next day, they discovered that Ellie had delivered 9 puppies and that Emma seemed a bit more welcoming to them. They took the girls and puppies to their home and contacted their pastor, who then contacted SoCo Rescue.\n\nWhen members of the SoCo team went to get Emma, Ellie and the pups, they discovered that Emma has also delivered two pups overnight. This came as a surprise to the two men as Emma hadn't looked pregnant the day before. SoCo Rescue took both moms and all 12 newborn pups into their care.\n\nEmma initially was scared and apprehensive of our offers of help but quickly shed her fears of all that was new and uncertain to her. While she's still a little shy, she is now interacting very well with our staff. Her ideal home would be one without small children and a bit on the calmer side to give Emma the opportunity to adjust. We're positive that Emma will open up toher new family the same way she has with our staff.\n\nEmma has been fully vetted, started on her monthly preventatives and de-wormed. Her recent heartworm test came back negative and she appears to be in excellent health despite her homeless ordeal. We don't think Emma has ever been an indoor dog or received much training so her adopter should be prepared to offer basic training to her.\n\nIf interested in adopting Emma, please submit an application at socorescue.com",

            "description": "FULLY SPONSORED ADOPTION\nMeet our beautiful 4 year old girl Hope!\n\nHope came to Partners for Pets in January 2018. She's been in our care for just over 2 years now, and she's more than ready to find a home of her own. Will you help us find it??\n\nIf Hope had a Netflix account (or even knew what Netflix was) her go-to movie category would be \"movies that feature strong female leads.\" Hope is an effervescent, intuitive and\n\nplayful girl who is looking for the right match in a playmate.\n\nShe needs a male playmate who is also very playful but will let her be in charge. Basically, she is the canine embodiment of every Beyonc song. She tends to be a little selective in a male partner, but honestly? Good for her. She knows her worth.\n\nIn terms of other pets, Hope gives cats a two thumbs down. (If she had thumbs, that is.) No small children, please.\n\nIf you're interested in adopting Hope and have a male dog who you'd like to introduce to her, fill out an application and we will be more than happy to schedule a meet and greet. This girl is something fiercely special to us, and we want to make sure it's the right fit.\n\n\n\nHope is spayed, current on all vaccinations, heartworm negative, dewormed and microchipped.\n\nAdoption applications are available at\nwww.partnersforpetsil.org/\napplications.\n\nAdoptions are held at the O'Fallon, IL PetSmart every Saturday of the month from 11am-3:30pm and at the Glen Carbon, IL PetSmart every Sunday from 11am-3:30pm. We are also at Petco in Edwardsville Crossing on Sundays from 11:30-3:30 pm. The cats are only at Glen Carbon Petsmart. Please let us know if you are interested in a pet and we can arrange to have them meet you at one of the adoption events.",

I'm very sweet and I love to be touched and petted. There is nothing better than the love from my family!!\n\nI have come to really enjoy taking walks! I am trying really hard not to be too nervous on the walks and like to stay near my person, so sometimes I try to stay right by my foster mom's legs while we are walking.\n\nI'm really good about going potty outside and I've figured out how to tell them when I need to go. I sleep on a dog bed in my foster mom's room and I do fine with that but I am ok in my kennel if that's what you prefer as well. I really like being outside and I feel most comfortable in the fenced yard! I am a little anxious while riding in the car but with each trip I am getting much better!\n\nMy perfect family would be someone who is willing to be patient with me as I learn to understand all about this big new world. I have so much love inside me to give. I just know with love, patience and positive reinforcement I am going to blossom into a beautiful smiling flower!\n\n\nFOSTER TO ADOPT:\nSmiley just completed Heartworm treatment and is waiting for a negative test result which can take 2-9 months after treatment. During these months, she will need to make sure her heart rate is not elevated due to high energy play or exercise. Smiley is only available through the Foster to Adopt Program at this time. The commitment will be for an adoption but will be fostering until she is cleared with a negative Heartworm test result. All of the medical expenses will be paid for by the rescue while she is in a foster to adopt home. \n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nAll our Warrior Dogs will have all age appropriate medical care and vaccines, a microchip, and spay/neuter before adoption unless age is a factor with a puppy younger than 6-12 months at the time of adoption. If that is the case, the spay/neuter will be covered in the adoption fee and the owner will be responsible to have the procedure completed at a Warrior Dog Rescue Veterinarian at the appropriate time.\n\nPlease note that the majority of our dogs in rescue are from shelters where they have been found as strays or abandoned. Their breed description is based on our very best educated guess based on physical characteristics and their dispositions. If they came to our rescue as an owner surrender, the breed description will be listed as provided by the previous owner.\n\nAdoption Fee - $450\n\nTo apply for this pup, please submit an Adoption Application at http://warriordogrescue.com/adopt/adoption-application/",

Farah really enjoys snuggling with her people (foster dad even calls her \"velcro\"), she loves playing with her foster dog sibling, and tennis balls are a favorite! She is crate trained, house trained and non-destructive, making her the perfect pup. She's also learning basic commands and doing a great job! Farah loves wearing her fancy sweater so she may request her own wardrobe closet but it's negotiable because mostly she just wants a family to love her forever - could it be yours?\n\nFarah is about 4 years old and weighs about 37 pounds.\n\nIf you're interested in meeting Farah, please visit our website to learn about our adoption process and to fill out an application, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs and cats will be micro-chipped, spayed or neutered, and up-to-date on vaccinations at the time of adoption. For more photos of Farah, follow us on Facebook Gateway Pet Guardians and Instagram @gatewaypets ... #gpgFarah. \n\nTo view other adoptable pets from our shelter, please visit, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nGateway Pet Guardians is proud to offer a variety of mixed breed dogs available for adoption. However, please keep in mind that we rarely know the genetic background of the animals we rescue and, as such, we cannot guarantee the exact breed combinations found within this dog. However, we do not know his/her actual genetic makeup. Just know that this dog is probably a variety of several different breeds that have combined to create one very amazing and unique animal.",

            "description": "Please email info@prairiepaws.org to fill out an application and arrange an appointment to meet the pet. Want to get a head start on the application? Here's the link: DOG ADOPTION APPLICATION: https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/PPAS/Dog\n\nHadley is a young fun-loving, happy Retriever mix with an estimated DOB of 12/05/2019. He weighed 50 lbs at intake.  He came to us as a stray. Hadley just wants to say that sure girls just wanna have fun but he WANTS to have fun too! This goofy, life-loving, happy goofball just wants a family to call his own and teach him to be the best family member he longs to be. He wants to learn EVERYTHING! Helps that he is smart too. He LOVES toys, especially stuffed ones. He WILL chase cats and needs to be taught boundaries with the feline cuties. Hadley's adoption fee is $190 which includes a medical exam, sterilization surgery, age-appropriate vaccinations, dewormer, heartworm testing, and a microchip.\n\nVisual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. As we get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n\nOur animals change daily, so please check our lists of adoptable dogs and adoptable cats frequently. Once you find an animal you\u2019d like to adopt, the next steps are to complete an application and request a meet and greet with the foster. Make sure to be thorough and help us understand why you\u2019re interested in that particular animal \u2014 and why your home is a great fit. Based on your answers we may even have a better fit for you.\n\nAll PPAS dogs are up to date on all of their vaccines (including rabies if age appropriate), and will be microchipped and registered in the adopter's name at the time of adoption. Adopters get a free consultation at an area vet partner within 14 days of adoption. Any dog that is six months of age or older will be tested for Heartworms and if found negative, will be kept on Heartworm prevention during their shelter stay, after the adoption it is up to the adopter to continue the highly recommended Heartworm preventative treatment. Also all PPAS shelter dogs are treated with a monthly topical flea/tick preventative and we ask that adopters continue that treatment as well.  All dogs and cats per state law are sterilized before they begin their new fabulous lives with their new families.\n\nAdoption fees: Adoption fees must be paid in full at time of adoption \u2013 no partial payments are accepted. All major credit cards are accepted. Adoption fees vary. Please note if you live in the city of Ottawa a dog license fee must also be paid at time of adoption. Annual renewal of dog licenses is required between January 1st and February 15th.\n\nTaking your animal home: The State of Kansas requires that all cats and dogs must be sterilized (spayed/neutered) before going to their new homes. In most cases animals will have already been sterilized before being placed on the adoption floor and you will be able to take your new companion home with you the day of adoption. However, if the animal is not yet sterilized, they will need to stay at the shelter and we will schedule the surgery on the next available date (usually within a week). We do request that all dogs go home with a collar/leash.\n\nIf you are interested in this pet, please either email Prairie Paws Animal Shelter at info@prairiepaws.org, for an application or visit our website @ prairiepaws.org for more information.\n\nPrairie Paws Animal Shelter\n3173 HWY K68\nOttawa, KS 66067\n785-242-2967\nprairiepaws.org\ninfo@prairiepaws.org",

I'm not just \"kinda\" looking forward to meeting you and finding a forever home, I'm REALLY excited about going home with you. I love to be petted and touched and will let you know when I want more. My body will wiggle, and my soft tail will wag a lot! My favorite thing is belly rubs, and I will roll over on my back so you can give me lots! I'm always on the go and would enjoy exercise, training and playing with you. I enjoy toys, and I could use some training to improve my leash manners. I enjoy seeing other dogs and so want to go to them to say \"HI\", so I tend to pull on my leash to get to them peacefully. I'm not at all dog aggressive-just being friendly. I don't have any know history living with other dogs, cats or children, and I would like to meet your family to see if we'd get along. I'll always have a big smile and be ready to love you when you return home to me. Best part of my day, in fact. I hope to meet you soon. Love, Kynda",

Experience with the bully breeds and understanding how to be a good consistent pack leader is a must for your application to be considered. They say I am a really sweet and silly girl; I can be a bundle of fun with a happy tail. I know sit, down and come. I am eager to please so I learn quickly. My 3 favorite past times are snuggling with my special person, taking walks and taking naps. I even get along well with cats. I am crate-trained and house broken. If you have room in your heart and family for a silly bundle of love, please ask about me today. Oh, I also must have a secured fenced in yard. Apply to adopt me @ http://www.arfla.org/info/adoption Updated: 12/14/2020\n\nClick here to watch a video of Farrah.\n\nSee our Adoptions Info webpage\n\nfor more info on our adoption requirements, fees.

He loves to play with other dogs but doesn't really have the skills to stop when play is over, so he needs someone who will put him through school to teach him the proper way to engage with friends.Here is the thing.... He doesn't really want to share his home with other animals. He can go out and about (daycare) but he needs a few time outs during the day to settle down and relax. Remember he doesn't always know the cues. But he wants to learn.Another important thing.... He will, and I mean will protect you from the evil vaccum who wants to obviously eat the house. He will chase that vaccum and make sure it can't harm you. So might be better to have floors over carpet as the broom is not as evil.He will make you laugh. If you are a terrier person and have the patience to really give him a chance to be the great dog he can be, he would love to come learn from you....\nIf you have previously applied with us please email mars.apc.dept@gmail.com to reactivate your application with new interest.\n\nor\n\nPETFINDER VIEWERS: Find our applications at www.midwestanimalrescue.org\n\n*The pet you are viewing is a rescued pet which is most often from an animal control facility and does not come with a pedigree. The breed(s) listed are our best guess and are in no way guaranteed. Sometimes the pets appear to be a particular breed(s) in the pictures we receive from our rescue partners and when they arrive we are surprised to see an entirely different breed(s) in person! If you choose to DNA test your adopted pet, test results may vary from company to company and our breed guess may not be reflected in those results as it is just that, our best guess. It is with deep longing that we wish there was a breed called \"cute\" as we believe all of our dogs would fall under this new breed classification!\n\n//",

She was totally shut down and won't get up to walk. It was originally thought that she may have back leg issues but that is not the case she was just terrified and sick. It has taken some time but she is finally eating well and has gained a couple of pounds. She needs to be potty trained and leash trained. When you take her outside and close the door behind her she pancakes and won't move. Her iron numbers are slightly down but she came to us during her heat cycle. Currently, on a iron supplement her numbers are going down slowly. There is a scheduled spay date of 2/1/21 and we are hoping that will help most of the iron deficiency. Her favorite thing to do is cuddle, so if you are looking for a great companion and have the love, patience and understanding for our Mastino Royalty Princess Barbarella please go to our website at www.mastinorescue.org and complete a Family Profile and a volunteer from our team will be in touch. Please be patient as we are extremely busy. Due to our insurance restrictions you must own you home, have a 6 foot privacy fence and no children under the age of 10 to be consider. Barbarella is currently in Missouri but transport to the perfect home can be arranged.",

            "description": "Have you met Wolfie?\n\n5-year-old Wolfie was brought to the Lancaster Shelter with his 9-year-old sister Sofia after their owner passed away. They are very bonded, and we are looking to place them together in a home.\n\nShortly after becoming Frosted Faces on October 10th, Sofia and Wolfie went to live in a Foster home, and we've learned so much about what these two cuties are like in a home environment!\n\nWolfie weighs 25 lbs and follows boss Sofia. He is a happy-go-lucky guy and has the biggest heart. He has never met a stranger and loves it all, from kisses to cuddling and belly rubs. He is very well-behaved and loves to nap. Wolfie's limited vision does not stop him from enjoying anything in life. He mapped the house in about a day and confidently walks around without any problems. He adapted quickly and also follows his favorite human and Sofia for additional guidance as needed. Wolfie also has a skin issue which caused him to lose a massive amount of fur, but he has been receiving a medicated bath every few days and his fur has been growing back very quickly. His coat looks amazing now! His future family will need to continue to monitor this issue and possibly continue the medicated baths. The good news is that Wolfie is great at bath time and happily cooperates for some peanut butter. Wolfie's shedding is also very minimal.\n\nSofia and Wolfie's Foster Mom shared, \"Sofia and Wolfie are a very special, bonded pair who love nothing more than to cuddle, nap, and follow their favorite human around the house. Sofia can typically be found burrowing under her favorite blanket on the couch with Wolfie following her along wherever she goes. They are typically mellow but do have an occasional burst of energy once or twice a day and comically wrestle with each other. Sofia does not seem to like large dogs but they both got along well with other small dogs at the Frosted Faces play yard. Wolfie does not appreciate it when other male dogs try to hump his sister Sofia, but who can blame him! They also enjoy taking short walks around the neighborhood and are both outgoing and friendly greet people of all ages.\n\nSofia and Wolfie are lovable couch potatoes and bring out the silly side in each other. They still have a fun, playful energy about them and are quite the comedy duo. Some people can be hesitant to adopt two dogs but when you meet them and see their relationship dynamic, you quickly realize why they should stay together and that having two dogs is not such a dramatic difference. They follow each other everywhere and do most things together, often simultaneously, so there is not much additional effort required. The biggest problem that you will encounter is deciding who to pet first! Sofia and Wolfie are the quintessential low energy lap dogs who are looking for a forever family with a comfy couch and two free hands for lots of petting.\"\n\nPlease see Sofia's profile for additional information about her!\n\nWolfie and Sofia are having a great time in their Foster home, but a Forever Family is what they want most of all! Apply to meet this amazing duo: www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nVisit during Open House: Saturdays & Sundays, 10 am - 1 pm\n\nLearn more about our programs at: www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family No adoption fees and we help with medical costs!\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\nUpdated: 1/20/21 KG",

            "description": "Have you met Sofia?\n\n9-year-old Sofia and her brother Wolfie were brought to Lancaster Shelter after their owner passed away.\n\nThey are very bonded, and we are looking to place them together in a home.\n\nShortly after becoming Frosted Faces on October 10th, Sofia and Wolfie went to live in a Foster home, and we've learned so much about what these two cuties are like in a home environment!\n\nSofia weighs just 12 lbs., but she is the confident leader of the pair. She is potty trained, has good house manners, loves to burrow and nap, has no known health issues, and according to her Foster Mom, she is one of the easiest foster dogs they've ever had. Sofia is adorably sweet, loves all forms of attention, is always wagging her tail whenever eye contact is made, and loves to flip over for belly rubs. As a bonus, she has velvety soft fur, and the shedding is very minimal to nonexistent.\n\nSofia and Wolfie's Foster Mom shared, \"Sofia and Wolfie are a very special, bonded pair who love nothing more than to cuddle, nap, and follow their favorite human around the house. Sofia can typically be found burrowing under her favorite blanket on the couch with Wolfie following her along wherever she goes. They are typically mellow but do have an occasional burst of energy once or twice a day and comically wrestle with each other. Sofia does not seem to like large dogs but they both got along well with other small dogs in the Frosted Faces play yard. Wolfie does not appreciate it when other male dogs try to hump his sister Sofia, but who can blame him! They also enjoy taking short walks around the neighborhood and are both outgoing and friendly greet people of all ages.\n\nSofia and Wolfie are lovable couch potatoes and bring out the silly side in each other. They still have a fun, playful energy about them and are quite the comedy duo. Some people can be hesitant to adopt two dogs but when you meet them and see their relationship dynamic, you quickly realize why they should stay together and that having two dogs is not such a dramatic difference. They follow each other everywhere and do most things together, often simultaneously, so there is not much additional effort required. The biggest problem that you will encounter is deciding who to pet first! Sofia and Wolfie are the quintessential low energy lap dogs who are looking for a forever family with a comfy couch and two free hands for lots of petting.\"\n\nPlease see Wolfie's profile for additional information about him!\n\nSofia and Wolfie are having a great time in their Foster home, but a Forever Family is what they want most of all! Apply to meet this amazing duo:\nwww.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nVisit during Open House: Saturdays & Sundays, 10 am - 1 pm\n\nLearn more about our programs at: www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family No adoption fees and we help with medical costs!\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\nUpdated: 1/20/21 KG",

Daisy has been in a home this whole time but unfortunately, has been returned because the other dog in the home was very jealous of Daisy.\n\nDaisy LOVES PEOPLE and has the CUTEST wiggle butt!!!! However, she needs a home with older/considerate kids only (older teens) and a family that has experience with dogs. Daisy is good with most dogs but really should be the only pet, as cats aren't her thing either.\n\nDaisy is a smart girl & she knows some commands - Sit, Stay, Done. She's playful and she loves to play with her toys or a good game of \"Fetch\". She's also a well-mannered houseguest who is both housetrained & good in a crate! She really just wants to please you & love you, being loved in return by her family.\n\nTo fill out an application on Daisy, visit EHRDOGS.ORG and don't forget to mention DAISY SCAS!",

            "description": "IMPORTANT!!!   All adoptions are by appointment only going forward and are spaced 30 minutes apart. PLEASE call the shelter directly during business hours for more information (see number below).  You need to make sure that the animal in which you have an interest is still available and to set up an appointment to meet the specific animal.  Once you arrive at the shelter for your scheduled appointment, please follow the directions that you were given over the telephone. If you are running late for your appointment or will be unable to make your scheduled appointment time, notify staff immediately. This will enable them to schedule that time for another prospective adoptive family. If necessary, they will be able to reschedule your appointment to a more convenient time.  \n\nADOPTION RETURN: If you are looking for a happy dog, be sure to ask to meet SHIRLEY TEMPLE. This female bulldog/lab mix is a happy girl, as you can see from her photos. Getting outside even if it is just for a photo shoot is a big deal for shelter dogs.  She weighed 47 pounds at intake, but has been there for a while getting treated for a skin condition which has now cleared up. She was adopted at the end of December, at which time she was spayed. The family had other dogs and SHIRLEY was not able to successfully bond with the other dogs. It was determined that she might be best in a one dog home. She is available for adoption and can go home the same day because she has already been spayed. Please be sure to take an appropriate size dog crate with you in your car, as well as a dog leash, to your adoption appointment. Staff would like to ensure that both of you arrive home safely together. If you do have other dogs and want to consider her for an addition to your family, check with staff about how they can help to safely introduce her to your dogs at the shelter in a neutral environment first.  Call to schedule an adoption appointment now.\n\nAdoption fees are $80 for dogs.  Cat adoption fees are $50. Cash or check only. Please be sure to take the exact amount with you.\n\nNOTE: All shelter fees are under review and may be changed or modified at any time without advance notice.\n\nThe shelter routinely vaccinates all healthy appearing animals upon their arrival at the shelter and deworms them.  Any animals not already spayed/neutered must have the procedure done through the veterinary clinic that contracts with the county before that animal can be released from the clinic to the new family. By state law, animals old enough to be given a rabies vaccine, must have that vaccine done, as well.  The vaccine is given by the veterinary clinic staff at a separate cost to the adoptive family. \n\nHold periods for every incoming animal vary for several reasons including, but not limited to, whether the animal came in from the Cumberland County area, or from the City of Crossville, which contracts with the county for its animal shelter services.  Check with the staff to verify the availability date of every animal for which you have an interest.\n\nFor more information on this pet, call the shelter at (931)484-8525. The shelter is open Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday from 10am to 2pm. Closed Wednesday and Sunday and county observed holidays.",

My foster family has a little girl and a grown-up dog and I like playing with them too. I'm working on crate and potty training and I already walk to the grass to potty (sometimes). My foster family is starting to teach me basic commands like SIT, STAY, COME and LEAVE IT. I\u2019m gonna be a big boy!\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2020 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq",

Throughout his time with his first adopter, he developed severe skin issues. He became very itchy and started to lose his hair; specifically on his belly, neck, and behind. His past owner did their best to find a diagnosis and get him feeling better, but had to surrender him eventually due to financial constraints. He was slightly thin when he arrived too, but has been putting on weight with a special diet. He will have to be on this special diet until we find out more answers.\nYou can tell his body has not been kind to him. He looks older than 6 years old, but through it all he has not let that dull his sparkle. He is such a lover boy. He loves to cuddle and likes to be a lap dog if you let him. He is house trained and great in his kennel. He does really well with all the dogs in his foster home. Even the grumpy girl dog there likes him! He also does well with kitties.\nSince he arrived back at BDAR, we have been in constant contact with a veterinarian about his diagnosis. We recently found he has a skin infection that was resistant to the antibiotics we were trying. He is now on new antibiotics and we should see improvement soon! He will likely be on this medication for 6-8 more weeks. After that time, Logan may not be out the woods completely and will require follow-up veterinary visits. Right now, he is on three types of medication and a special diet, all of which add up to a significant monthly expense. We are hopeful that the new antibiotic will do the trick and as time goes on, the other medications and maybe even the prescription diet can be eliminated. Anyone that adopts Logan can expect the need to have regular visits with their veterinarian for several months.\nIf you are interested in learning more about Logan and his needs or would just like to meet and adopt him, fill out an application today! You can also give us a call at 307-514-4024. We will be more than happy to answer any questions you may have about this sweet boy.If you are not viewing this adoption listing from our website at www.bdar.org, please go there to get more information, find our adoption application, or submit an inquiry.

Sweet Beverly stayed by his side until someone found him :(  \n\nThis old gal still has a lot of life left in her!  She's very sweet and good with kids and other dogs, but is a bit too interested in cats.  She is deaf, but that doesn't effect her one bit!  She's housetrained and does great outside of a crate when you leave.  Her energy level is such that she would be a great companion for an older person.  \n\nBeverly's adoption fee is $150 and she is spayed, vaccinated, and microchipped.

Here at the shelter he has hung out with other dogs without incident so he may be happy living with another mature, calm dog. Shogun enjoys going on walks and rolling around in the grass and would love a belly rub once he knows you. He has a lot of typical German Shepherd characteristics and is protective of his home so he is looking for a home without kids and someone experienced with German Shepherd or guardian-type breed characteristics. If you think Shogun would be a good fit for your home, please make an appointment with one of our virtual adoption counselors to get more information on him! Check out my photos/videos!",

            "description": "\nWhy Choose Me?\n\nI remembered Mia as soon as I saw her, and she remembered me. She came bounding out of the back of her kennel and was thrilled to see an old friend. Mia had been adopted from ACCAS earlier this year, and she was the same sweet dog I remembered. She sat next to me on the picnic table enjoying pets and being close. Her coat was soft and well-cared for. \n\nWhen I got home, I looked up her old bio and read that she had originally been nervous and always going to the gate like she was ready to go home. It also said that she could climb fences. Mia wasn\u2019t nervous today, but after we visited for a while, she did go to the gate and stand and look at me like she was saying it was time for her to go home. \n\nI bet Mia is a wonderful companion. Hopefully, she\u2019ll be reunited with her owner, but if not, she\u2019ll bond with a new family. I don\u2019t know if she can still climb a fence but being inside with her loved ones would probably suit Mia just fine.\n\nIf you are interested in fostering, adopting, or rescuing Mia, call 706-613-3540 to discuss options with staff.\n\nYou can read more about this dog and check out additional photos here: https://athenspets.net/Adoptables/54673-mia/ OR check out our urgent dogs (http://tinyurl.com/Athenspets-FB-URGENT-Dogs) on Facebook!\n\nThis dog is currently at Athens-Clarke County Animal Control, located at 125 Buddy Christian Way, Athens, GA. For the most timely information on hours, location, availability and how to adopt, call the shelter any day from 10am-4pm at 706-613-3540 or go to https://www.athensclarkecounty.com/133/Animal-Control.\n",

            "description": "Choco came to us from an upstate animal shelter after his owners surrendered him because they had trouble confining him. Apparently he was typically tied up, but when the family's kids came home from school they untied him and left gates and doors open. He went to a neighbor's house and initiated fence-fighting with the three resident Jack Russell Terriers. There was difficulty with the animal control officers determining specifics about Choco because of a language barrier. From what was learned, Choco can be quite protective of his home, owners and car, even jumping out of a car window after perceiving a threat. He's reactive on leash to other dogs but appears to be able to live with compatible dogs, and he was good with the kids he lived with. If we place him with kids, they should be old enough to responsibly keep gates and doors closed since Choco has shown he'll dash out and be territorial about his home. It was also noted that he had killed a cat. He's about 2 years old.",

I'm a short, stocky, big headed, blind in my left eye bundle of love. I love to get in your lap. I don't know I'm 100 plus pounds. I am housebroken and crate trained but I have escaped a time or two .I like to play fetch with my squeaky toy fox. I sit for treats and love peanut butter. My back left foot is bigger than the rest and it is missing a toe .I have hip dysplasia due to past trauma but none of that stops me. I do have a small problem with who the boss is and like most 3 to 5 year old's I have a problem listening sometimes. I have been good with kids, cats, my foster sister and my foster mom. I have been neutered and have had a gastropexy. I walk well on a leash. I am up to date on vaccinations too. If you want to play with me and have me give you love back please apply to adopt me at KGDR.org",

He is mostly a good boy but we have noticed that he doesn't like being snuck up on by strangers and will become territorial or defensive.  He will need an owner that can strongly advocate for him when out in public or in the home and someone that can help him learn better coping mechanisms for dealing with the unexpected.  For this reason, we do think a home without young kids is better.",

She is 64 pounds of loves, cuddles and kisses. CC loves taking walks and would be a fantastic running partner. Her leash manners need some fine tuning. She is highly motivated by treats and quickly picks up on routines and wants to learn new skills. CC would be a fantastic fit for an active family. She adores people, but sometimes forgets about her size and can get overexcited. CC would also do best as an only dog. CC knows basic obedience commands like sit and wait. Chasing after balls, loving on her \"baby\" and playing tug are just a few ways she likes to spend her days. CC is crate trained. If she doesn't win you over by just her sweet nature, she certainly will with her \"singing\" skills where she can say \"I love you\".\n\nAll our dogs require secure VISIBLE fencing. Height dependent upon the dog.\n\nAll current pets in adoptive home must be spayed/neutered and up to date on vaccinations.\n\nAdopter must be at least 21 years of age.\n\nAdoption Fee: $300\n\nAll our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped and up to date on vaccinations.\n\nAdoption applications can be found on our website: www.connectionspetrescue.org\n\n2/2/21 1:19 PM",

He went straight in to training to address some behavior/socialization issues he had not yet learned but has done very well. He is fully vetted and chipped HW+ but has started a slow kill regimen. \n\nThis is the trainers take on Milton......\nMilton likes the company of the humans but he'll tell you when his not in the mood, so I'd say no small children. He does well with other dogs he's selective with who he plays with, I think he likes playful dogs, so young dogs will be ok too. He might need a confident owner, someone with alpha personality, someone that can give him Boundaries and not someone that thinks he's going to be his baby, at that point Milton will start becoming dominant again and his old habits will emerge. He's a dog that needs to understand his place in the house. As long as that is clear everything will be fine. He knows better, he listens and respond very well to commands so as long as the adopter uses the training he knows and treats him as a dog and not a baby things will be fine.",

It was not something we consider a provoked bite due to the dogs fighting at the time. She is a sweet dog and will just need a home without other dogs. She is very scared to be here so you need to go slow with her. Just let her get to know you at her own pace.  She  is 4 1/2 years old and available for adoption. She is housebroken!! Ellie Rose is spayed and has her 2021 rabies vaccination. Hurry in to meet her!\n\nEllie Rose is located at the Richland County Dog Shelter in Mansfield, OH\n\nPhone is 419-774-5892\nIt is an application process.

We feel his life in the lam has given him enough negative feedback so he is not sure when he first meets someone that they are friendly. He would do best in an adult household or kids over 12. His adoption fee is $200\n\n\nAfter reading this pet's info, if you are still interested in adopting, please fill out the online adoption application found at www.realgooddogrescue.com \n\nThe ideal home for this Real Good Dog will have a secure fenced yard.

            "description": "Daisy was surrendered to PNW Cattle Dog Rescue in August from a family in Texas. They had gotten her from another family that kept her in a 10' x 10' kennel for the first 8 months of her life. With her people, Daisy is sweet, affectionate and eager to please. She needs an adopter who is ready for a high-drive cattle dog. She is very smart and wants to engage with her people. She'll start predicting your next action if you're not paying attention! She'd love to do agility or other dog sports. Around the house she often acts before she thinks so she needs practice with impulse control and basic obedience.\n\nDaisy has struggled with the transition to life in the Northwest. She's reactive to moving vehicles, bikes, skateboards and other animals. We recommend an adoptive home without other animals. In the foster home, Daisy has will guard or steal food and toys from other dogs if given the opportunity. She'd need quite a bit of management in a multi-dog home til she feels more secure with family and routine. She has gone after cats and chickens in previous living situations, so we don't recommend an adoptive home with small animals. Given her current level of reactivity and her training needs, we will not place her in a home with small kids. \n\nDaisy loves fetch with frisbee or ball. She's very athletic and LOVES playing in water! She loves trail running with her foster dad. She likes dog toys and will happily entertain herself if there's nothing else to do. She's content napping on couch when things are mellow around the house. After a transition to a new living situation, Daisy initially shows mild separation anxiety when crated or alone (barking, whining). But once she's settled in the new environment and routine, she's comfortable alone. She loves Nylabones and chew toys.\n\nIn Jan 2021, Daisy is in board & train with Kay Fontaine of The Mindful Mutt in Seattle, WA. Her adoptive home will need to be dedicated to on-going basic obedience training, impulse control and a heavy emphasis on helping reduce her reactivity. Daisy will be available for meet & greets with potential adopters during this time! If you're interested in meeting Daisy, please fill out an adoption application on our website: pnwcdr.org/adopt \n\nDaisy is 1.5 years old, spayed, microchipped and has received age-appropriate core vaccines. Daisy's adoption fee is $330. Please note: We do not do DNA testing on our foster dogs. The breed description is our best guess based on the dog\u2019s appearance, mother\u2019s appearance, paperwork, etc. \n\nADOPTION PROCESS: \n- Adoption Application\n- Phone Convo \n- Meet & Greet \n- Home Visit \n- Application Approval \n- Adoption Fee & Contract \n\nADOPTION APPLICATIONS: \npnwcdr.org/adopt",

Mango is a sweet boy always looking for a little attention and even a treat or two. Sharing is caring, and Mango has such nice manners when it comes to sharing his toys. He is such a lovable boy- and handsome too! Mango is an energetic pupper with a lively personality, so it would be important for him to get the exercise he needs to tire him out. Mango has yet to find his perfect match, so he has been patiently waiting for his forever family to walk through the shelter doors...and walk him out! Mango would appreciate a family with lots of love and patience, because he is such a good boy who needs a bit of understanding. Mango is a bit nervous around other dogs, a dog meet would be a perfect way for Mango to become more socialized with a potential fur sibling. Interested in meeting Mango? Give us a call at (973)824-7080 to schedule an meet & greet with this handsome face!",

Chelo is spayed, up to date on shots and current on monthly heart worm prevention. To learn more about Chelo, please contact Rhonda at vzcountyhs@gmail.com",

To learn about fostering dogs like Thanos, please contact us at http://www.dogsxlrescue.org/volunteer/foster\n\nName: Thanos\n\nBreed: Great Dane\n\nApproximate Age: 11 months \n\nApproximate Weight: 110 pounds\n\nCurrently Living at: Local foster home\n\n\n\nMeet Thanos! Thanos is a big, rambunctious boy with a lot of puppy energy and a heart as big as his body! Thanos is an absolute love with his people, but he can be wary of strangers so he needs a quiet home without a lot of people coming and going and a family who\u2019s willing to help socialize him gradually so he learns that new humans = new friends! Thanos has not had much formal training and sadly, he's been bounced around a bit because of his size and energy, so Thanos is looking for a committed forever family who will help him learn his manners and can handle a bit of a bull in a china shop! Since Thanos is just a 110 pound puppy, he is looking for an adopter with large/XL dog experience who knows how to handle an overgrown pony who wants to sit in your lap and lean against your leg at all times. Thanos does well with other large dogs and would love a dog buddy to wrestle and play with! Though he is a sweet and affectionate guy, Thanos is probably best suited to an adults only home and is not well-suited to a family with young children. With some patient, consistent training, Thanos is sure to be the best ever companion for his new family! Apply today to meet Thanos! \n\n\nThanos needs a foster or a loving forever home to lavish love and attention on him. Please open your heart and home to Thanos!\n\n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $300, which includes the cost of heartworm treatment and routine vetting, including vaccinations and spay/neuter.\n\n \n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out the application online at http://www.dogsxlrescue.org/adopt/adoption-questionnaire\n\n \n\nThank you for considering adoption and helping to save a life!\n\n\nPlease visit us online at www.DogsXLRescue.org",

Poor Penny was in rough shape and wouldn't even walk. Within hours of being with us she started opening up into the beautiful and wonderful dog she is now. She delivered her puppies, was an excellent momma and her puppies have all been adopted. Penny has been cured of her demodex, gained some weight, has been spayed and is currently undergoing her heartworm treatment. She weighs in at 39 pounds. She is an absolute love. Just wants to be by your side. Absolutely loves playing with other dogs. \n\nFor more information on Penny, please EMAIL Info@BigHearts4PawsRescue.org\n\nOur dogs/puppies are spayed/neutered, current on vaccinations, microchipped, dewormed and have flea/tick prevention applied. Any dogs over 5 months of age are heartworm free and are on heartworm preventive.\nOur adoption donation for our adult dogs is $150.00 and for our puppies it is $350.00. Adopting a puppy is a lifetime commitment. Are you ready for a new found friend?",

            "description": "My human passed awayOreo was born around December 14, 2014, and weighs about 60 pounds. Oreo is with us because his human passed away. It seems Oreo may have not had much exposure to new situations or people and can be rather shy. It doesn't take long for him to warm up and once he does he is stuck to you like glue. Oreo rides well in the car. Oreo would not appreciate young kids running around but older, respectful children should be fine. The Adoption Fee for this dog is $300.00\nAdoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a 'complete' pet. We accept CASH or Visa/Mastercard ONLY.\n\nJoyful Rescues has no funding except for our adoption fees and miscellaneous donations. Pet care and vet bills are expensive - you must be ready to take on this financial (as well as emotional) responsibility. YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 25 YEARS OF AGE TO ADOPT A DOG FROM JOYFUL RESCUES\n\nWe keep our pet list as up-to-date as possible. As soon as a pet is adopted, it is removed from the list. If a pet is still showing, it is still available for adoption.\n\nCan't Adopt Me? SPONSOR ME\nLook for the Link 'Special Instructions to Seller' if you want to note a particular pet\nBefore you seek to adopt a pet from Joyful Rescues, please read our Pet Adoption page http://www.joyfulrescues.org/pet_adoption.html.\n\nOnline Application",

I'm Bunny, an incredibly sweet and snuggly 9 year old Pittie/Boxer mix. I love love love people so much! And I am an excellent co-pilot, listener, and greeter-at-the-door! I am a super sweet dog who loves to go for walks (this helps with my arthritis) and then take a good snooze in a patch of sun. I would be a good family dog, but I do need someone who is home more than they are away. I'm a healthy girl, I just take daily joint supplements and an NSAID to help with my arthritis. I'm house-trained, and I love to go for car rides with you! I can be choosy about my canine friends, though I've made a few that I really like, so it is possible for me to have the right canine friend. But I would be super happy being the only dog! There's nothing I like more than being showered with love and attention! I hope to meet you soon! ONLY ADOPTING TO ILLINOIS AT THIS TIME",

Calm for a Husky mix which is great thing for him and his family to be.\n\nLuca will put a smile on your face.  He is still a young dog at maybe just a year old, and he wants what every dog or cat wants: a safe, friendly, warm home to call his own.  He is waiting for the right family.\n\nHe is a sensitive boy who needs a moment to learn that you are a friend.  Once he's feeling safe and secure in a loving home setting, his adorable personality will shine.\n\nLuca will benefit from an adopter who appreciates his intelligence, diligence, and loyalty all of which he will show off through basic obedience training such as learning how to walk on a leash and basic commands.\n\nHe can live with another dogs similar in size and personality (mellow, aware).\n\nLuca is looking to join a family with an experienced adopter and kids 14-and-up.\n\nApplications are online at karmicrescue.org\n\nWhat breed is my dog? Please remember we do not complete DNA tests on our rescued pups. If we do not know who the mom or dad is for sure, we guess; we use Bing Visual Search. And, we look at their paws, ears, snout, coloring, and body build. So often, we are not spot on. Mutts are usually more healthy than not. And, remember too that even if you know the supposed dominant breed in your new puppy or adult dog, it does not mean that those particular genes will dominate your dog's personality.\n\n",

The foster has not been able to touch her but she follows her foster mom everywhere. She also wants to bolt so she has not even been outside she uses pads so that's good. The foster is currently just letting her do her thing and when she's ready she's hoping she will be a loving dog and that her resident dogs will show her the way. Honeymaren will need a very patient home and would do best with someone who has shy dog experience. She will need a very quite home as she is scared of noises. She does bark at noises so probably no apartments or shared wall living.\n\nAt her dental cleaning the vet did hear a heart murmur but she seems to be a healthy girl.\n\nAn adoption application is the best way to show your interest in an animal.\n\nPlease check out our website, www.ruffstartrescue.org for more details and additional pictures on any of our animals!\n\nAll Ruff Start dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccines, microchipped, dewormed, and on monthly flea/tick and heartworm prevention (dogs) as well as heartworm tested (dogs).\n\nRuff Start Rescue is a foster based rescue. Animals are located in homes throughout Minnesota. We do not have a facility where animals are kept.\n\nRuff Start Rescue Adoption Policies: http://www.ruffstartrescue.org/info/display?PageID=11744",

He'll benefit from an active family and a playmate equal to his energy level. He'd quickly overwhelm a senior dog or small children, so that should be considered in his new home.\n\nFound running loose in a Mesquite neighborhood; Maynard was turned into the city shelter when the finders couldn't keep him. When scanned for a chip, one was found and the owners were contacted but never replied to the calls, nor did they come to claim him. He'll make a great addition to an active household with the time to train him and focus his energies appropriately.",

I am also well trained and know quite a few commands. I would love to meet any other fur friends you may have before going home. I would also prefer a home with adults only. I have tons of energy and love to play. I also know when it's time to calm down and be an affectionate cuddler. I am definitely a ladies' man. Make an appointment to come and fall in love with me!\n\nKingston is currently living in a volunteer foster home.\nFill out this form https://forms.gle/pj317JttC7s38ibQA if you are interested in meeting him!",

He sits in the seat like a good boy and rides.\n\nHe's a big lovable teddy bear. He is also good with kids and other dogs.\n\nHe walks on leash pretty good. He is a stout boy so sometimes he likes to make you go his way.\n\nYogi is current on vaccinations and is neutered. This boy is ready for a home today!",

            "description": "Hi, my name is Hunter!\n\nI'm a 3-year-old, male, Red Nose American Staffordshire Terrier mix. Healthy, neutered, microchipped, and current on all of my shots. I love to go on car rides and walks. The humans say I'm great on a leash, have a sweet disposition and I'm well behaved. I have received training, so my new family can welcome a very well trained dog.\n\nHunter was abandoned by his previous owner and left in horrible, filthy surroundings. He was extremely thin and hungry as well as dirty and weak. Because of his unknown past, we believe that he will do best as the only dog in the home. This boy is so special and a Doggie Bonez favorite. Everyone that has met him has fallen in love. He has been in and out of foster homes and it is time that this lovely boy gets his break. Hunter is looking for his forever family. Are you a fun, loving, active family with older kids and looking to give this much deserving cutie everything he needs?\n\nIf so, please submit a completed adoption application found at www.doggiebonez.com so that we can schedule a meet and greet. He is also on all of our social media pages IG: @Doggie_Bonez_Inc_ and Facebook: Doggie Bonez.\n\nIf adoption isn't an option, please consider fostering one of our pups. We are a volunteer-run non-profit dog rescue and always welcome new short and/or long term doggie foster families. We greatly appreciate the help and time of our fosters. You provide all the love, comfort, and safety of a home and we supply you with everything else you may need, dog food, dog bed, toys, medical attention (if needed), etc. If you are interested please visit www.doggiebonez.com to see all of our available dogs who need a foster family while waiting for their fur-ever home and complete the foster application.",

If you have any questions regarding one of our Mastiffs, please read their bio and if you still have questions- drop us an email at info@greatplainsmastiffrescue.org . If you have questions about our adoption procedures, please go to our Pages of Interest on the left hand column under 'Adoption Info.' We answer email inquiries almost immediately-usually always within a few hours and phone calls are returned with 24-36 hours.\n\nGPMR does not have a shelter. All of our dogs are kept in loving foster homes. We must have a completed adoption\napplication on file before meeting any of our mastiffs.\n\nGPMR adopts to the states of Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, Arkansas, Missouri, Louisiana and parts of Colorado.\n!!!Any mastiffs being adopted out of the state of Oklahoma require a health certificate to be paid for by the adopter!!!\n\nMeet Sly! He came into GPMR with several of his relatives after being rescued by a local SPCA from a neglect situation. The breeder of these dogs was not providing adequate food or any vet care and turned them over to the SPCA. They were extremely underweight when they arrived at the SPCA. All of these dogs lived together and but were not socialized at all outside the home, and so in new situations they are very fearful. In their foster homes, they are doing great and do not show many signs of fear at all. We are working on leash training as only one of the dogs knew how to walk on a leash, the rest just dropped to the ground and wouldn't move. All of the dogs had fleas, intestinal parasites, and varying degrees of skin/ear/eye infections. The SPCA did an amazing job getting them started on the road to good health!Sly is 2 years old. He was one of the less fearful dogs in this group but while he has adjusted great to his foster family, he is very scared in new situations. He also is learning the comforts of sleeping on the couch and in bed with his foster mom. Sly is a velcro Mastiff for sure. When we first tried crating him, he panicked and immediately tried to break out of the crate. It's not uncommon for these guys to have some separation anxiety like this going through the rehoming process. We is adjusted to the crate now and does well in there, primarily used when his foster family leaves the home otherwise he will chew stuff up. Sly's adoptive family will need to be patient with him through this adjustment. He should have another dog as a canine companion which should help. He would love to have a family who is home most of the day. He is also good with cats! Sly lives with teenagers and does just fine with them. Since we don't have any history of him with young kids, a home with older kids 12+ would be best. He would do best with someone who is home part of the day.Sly is being fostered in Edmond, OK.Save a Mastiff...Adopt, Foster, Volunteer!",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.JAN 2021 UPDATE: Hi all! Jana here. I'm a sweet southern gal we loves life to the fullest. My foster mom says I'm a muscle bound ball of energy. I can run, jump & would love to play all day long. My fur foster brother is nice but a bit on the lazy side. He also can have a bad attitude. When meeting another dog, I need time. I do not know how to control myself so very, very slow intros are a must. I'm very well behaved. I know sit, shake, wait, come. I'm part hound so when my nose is going I'm busy. Lol. I love people so much. I get really excited when I see my people. I jump & jump some more. I might be too much for toddlers. I will need someone who will keep me in line or I will take over the household. ______________________________________________From the foster mom: Jana will need someone who can set boundaries and work on her obedience skills. She had too much freedom in her past home and took advantage of the situation. Jans is improving daily and is very smart. She wants to learn and please her people. No young children in the home until she learns more indoor manners. Jana loves to play and after appropriate introductions, she can have lots of fun chasing and playing with other dogs. Jana does have a prey drive for outside critters so probably not good with cats.In Jana's own words: 'My foster mommy took me to work today. It was fun & very exhausting. I sat waiting to be shown what to do. Mommy brought me to 'my station'. It had a comfy place to lay down, toys, stuff to chew on. I'm thinking jack pot! Then I heard noises from the ceiling. I knew mommy didn't hear them so I let her know something was up. She told me it was a karate class? So then I let them know that I was down below & they were disturbing us. I also greated people & asked them if they really truly liked what they were eating. It was the best day.'Jana is brand new to RCBR and we are just learning about her. A few things we do know already is -- she has her full tail and knows how to use it and she is so well behaved and will sit & wait before going outside or through a gate. Jana can be picky with other dogs. Might be best as an only pet, but with time could get along with the right dog. Stay tuned for more details! Current foster home location is Minnesota.

He had surgery and received the care he needed, but then it was discovered he was heart-worm positive.\n\nWith a face like that - we knew we had to save him! One of our volunteers stepped up to foster him and could tell immediately what a sweet boy he is. He's a 65lb, goofy, lap dog!\n\nSimba is VERY treat motivated! He knows his basic commands - sit, stay, down and rollover :) Even though he is a smart cookie and knows these commands, he needs to work on not stealing pizza off the counter.\n\nBecause Simba is currently going through heart-worm treatment, he can only go to a home that will get him through this treatment. He does get along with other dogs with slow introductions, but because he wants to play he will need to be kept separate and calm. He also gets scared / startled easily so would do best in a home without a lot of traffic coming in and out and needs to be slowly introduced to new people.\n\nPlease fill out an application today to meet this handsome boy named Simba!\n\n**Follow Simba's journey on Instagram at @snuggly_simba\n\nAdoption donation includes Spay/Neuter, UTD on Vaccinations, deworming, and flea treatment.",

            "description": "Fred is a 3 year old neutered male feist mix who weighs 26 lbs. Fred was rescued from a property with many other dogs. Sadly, he was never given the care and attention he deserved and is understandably shy in new situations as a result. Living in a home is totally new to this sweet guy, so he is looking for a patient family that will teach him about the finer things in life. Fred warmed up to his foster mom quickly and now greets her with lots of tail wags and excitement. He is as loyal as they come and loves to follow her around. Fred is looking for a home with a fenced-in yard, as he is still learning how to walk on a leash. Fred seems to be wary of dogs that are bigger than him, so he needs a home without medium or large dog. Fred has done well with the respectful children he's met that understand to give him space as he settles in. Once he settles in, Fred is a puppy at heart and is very playful. He is good with cats, and he has been making progress with housebreaking and crate-training. We are so excited to watch Fred continue to blossom in a forever home. Could that be yours?\n\nInterested in adopting?

Please follow the rules below to ensure your application is reviewed; pay attention closely to these instructions because applications will NOT be processed if they are not followed. Please keep in mind that dog/cat availability is currently changing by the hour; you will receive an email if the animal you are interested in is no longer available. New dogs become available almost every day, so feel free to let us know if someone else interests you if your initial choice is already adopted! \n\nFill out the application (DOG: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IHD-DOG-Application-9-10-18.pdf, CAT: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IHD-CAT-Application.pdf) completely. Every question must be answered, and it must be signed.

If there are multiple dogs/cats, number them in order of priority. \n\n-Scan a copy of proof of home ownership (i.e. tax bill, deed, or mortgage payment - you can black out the account #, etc.) or animal clause/agreement of your rental agreement.\n\n-Attach the application and home ownership proof/rental agreement animal clause to a new email and send it to bark@iheartdogs.org. The subject line must be formatted to read \"\"#1 choice of dog/cat, Your First and Last Name\"\". Example: Subject: Fido, Jane Doe\nOnce your application is received, it will be assigned to an Adoption Counselor who will follow-up with the applicant who is the best fit within a few days, or to discuss other dogs/cats. It could take up to a couple of weeks for you to receive a final disposition on your application so there is no need to check on the status.\n\n-Introductions will be scheduled by appointment only, 45 minutes per appointment. The entire household, including current dogs, must be present for the appointment. The introductions will take place outside in our parking lot.\n\n-We will continue to perform vet checks for current and prior pets in the household.\n\n-Home visits will be in person for the yard and virtual for inside the home.\n\n-Finalizing the adoption will also be scheduled by appointment.\n\nWhile this process may seem cumbersome, it is interim during COVID-19, and it is designed to help us respond to the volume of emails we receive every day. Since we are receiving a high volume of applications, please be patient if a dog/cat is no longer available. \n\nThank you for your understanding.",

Cricket was found exploring marshland along Hwy 17, so it's unknown if she has experience living in a home. She is very friendly with humans, and would thrive in a home without other animals or children. Cricket's favorite pastimes are exploring during leash walks, butt scratchies, and burrowing under a big blanket to snuggle. Contact Pet Helpers at 843-795-1110 to meet Cricket.",

She's always so excited to greet people and doesn't know a stranger. She is a higher energy dog and would love to find a family that will take her on lots of walks. Bella does not have a lot of social skills when it comes to other dogs. She wants to be friends but isn't quite sure how to do that, and can be a bit dominating when trying to play. We are unsure how Bella Jae would do with cats but when she saw them through a window she was wiggly and seemed like she wanted to play.\n\nAll dogs are $100 which includes having them spayed/neutered, current on vaccines (age appropriate) and microchipped.\n\nWhile the shelter is currently closed due to COVID-19, we are setting appointments for adoptions or fosters. Please call 812-376-2505 or email animalcareservices@columbus.in.gov.\n\n",

            "description": "Thank you for considering a homeless/rescue dog, it does not matter where dogs are from what matters is where they will live the rest of their life. \n\nIf you are looking for a walking and hiking partner Coco is the girl for you.  She loves to walk and explore the different surroundings in the woods.  Her daily walking route is a rural path in the woods, her foster home is in a rural area away from the city.  Coco walks very well on a long lead.  When she sees her walking harness she becomes very excited.\n\nCoco is very sweet with beautiful honey brown eyes that invite you in she has a face that no one can resist, her red nose is always looking for a treat.  She knows to sit for her treat and food.  After relieving herself she runs back for her treat, she\u2019s very smart, she\u2019s the full package, good nature, good temperament and an amazing personality; she is loving and loyal great companion and dear friend she will bring much affection and love to a good family. \n\nIt is difficult to identify mixed breed dogs without proper knowledge of ancestry; a guess assessment of breed and age has been made, Chocolate Labrador mix, keep in mind Coco was a rescue dog once a stray but it is a known fact that she is certainly a true gem and a keeper.  Coco is approximately 1 1/2 years old, 65 pounds of happiness, she loves life, loves everyone, always ready to play and ALWAYS ready for a snack. \n\nCoco is looking for a family who will open their home and invite her in to join their family, she only wants to belong.  Coco was owner surrendered, her family decided to surrender her to Paws & Claws Rescue the family was not active and Coco needs an active family and Coco was considered an added expense.  She had an unhappy beginning, she\u2019s 2 years old and has given birth to 5 puppies.  Her life began on a chain she shows her appreciation giving wet messy kisses.  She has left her miserable, depressing life behind.   Rescue dogs form a lifelong bond with their families and are forever grateful for their new happy family and life.  \n\nActivity level:        High energy\nFavorite toy:         Rubber Kong toy stuffed with peanut butter\nTemperament:      Friendly temperament/sociable loves everyone.\nPersonality:           Awesome\n\nNow, her dream is having a good home with lots of toys of her own, bed, a home with a family that will shower her with love and attention, please open your heart and home give Coco a chance to prove her love\u201d. She is looking ahead waiting for a forever home where she can hang her leash and call \u201cHome, Sweet Home\u201d.  Coco is potty trained she sleeps in her large wire crate at night, sleeps all night.    \n\nOn nice weather days Coco spends her days basking in the sun in a fenced yard she enjoys napping in her doghouse.  Her activity level is high energy still very much a puppy herself.  She has a lovely personality she loves children, older children are recommended she is a big dog and rambunctious too active for small children/toddlers.  \n\nCoco is up-to-date on all her vaccinations and has been spayed.  Her adoption donation of $395.00 includes all her expenses and vetting.  Please email Delia Coco\u2019s foster mom for an application at rubsch@sbcglobal.net and include your phone number.\n\n\n\n",

He enjoys playing with other dogs as they catch his tail winds trying to catch up in a game of chase. Sinatra is a smart boy who always is working, calculating his altitude and path through sniffing the ground and putting his nose to the wind to determine flight conditions. When he does take time off, this boy enjoys the comfort of a pillow and blanket with his head resting on his human's lap.\n\nSinatra is happy to work with other canines as flight attendants to his pilot. However, he has not yet been around with cats or children, so we are unsure whether they would make a good crew.\n\nSinatra is an energetic pup looking for a home filled with ample activity, a sense of purpose and lots of love. Once Sinatra finds his family, he looks forward to holding them near to his heart, and who knows, angels may cheer because he and his family are together. If you are interested in meeting Sinatra, fill out your flight plan (application) at https://rescuecrew.org/adopt-animal-in-need/#adoptionapplication\n\nThe adoption fee covers the cost of the animal's spay/neuter surgery, microchipping, FIV/FeLK testing (for cats) or Heartworm Testing (for dogs), deworming and all core age appropriate vaccinations. For the most complete information regarding this animal, and all of our adoptable pets, please ensure you are visiting our website directly at www.RescueCrew.org. You can also access the necessary online adoption application here as well. Thank you.",

            "description": "Lucy is a 2 yo terrier mix who LOVES to play.  She's all of 35lbs and QUEEN of the head-tilt.  She is one spunky girl, so an active family, who can spend some time playing fetch with her, would be ideal.  Lucy is part bunny, so a secure fenced yard (at least 6ft tall) is a must for this bouncy, happy girl.  Lucy is all about chew toys and stuffies!  When she gets her mittens on a stuffie, she goes into full puppy mode.   As active as Lucy is, she absolutely adores cuddling up to her people.  Lucy=Snuggle Bug\n\nLucy was found by a very kind woman, wandering the streets of Birmingham, with painful neck lacerations from having been tied out.  Because of her past, Lucy's neck is sensetive (but completely healed) to collars and slip-leads, and she requires a harness.  She is leash-reactive, so an expereinced adopter is needed.  We recommend she be the dog in the home, as her days of being tethered have resulted in her being very nervous around other dogs, especially when she's on-leash.  She seems to be disinterested in cats.   \n\nIf you're interested in meeting sweet Lucy, please submit an application on our website!\n\nhttp://mustlovepawsrescue.com/home",

She is a big-time resource guarder and will get fussy over toys she sees as hers in a home with other dogs. She would do best in a home where she is her person's one-and-only. She takes some time to decompress in a new home and really thrives when there is structure and a routine. If you show her she can rely on you to keep her safe, she will be your best friend and show you undivided devotion like only a hound dog can.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please fill out an application. We do allow out of state adoptions and any transport costs are at the expense of the adopter. If you have further questions about this dog, please email us at ccradopt@gmail.com and someone will be in touch as soon as possible.\n\nPlease understand that we are an all volunteer group and we have jobs outside of this organization. We do our best to provide quick responses but occasionally they are a little slower. If you do not receive a response in 48 hours, please resend to make sure it's received.",

He is a handsome American Bulldog mix with maybe Mastiff? He's a very large guy, very well mannered, and housebroken. He's pretty laid back, likes to lounge around, would make a fantastic inside house companion. He gets a little nervous with loud noises, etc, so we feel it be best, if kids are in the home, they be older such as 12 or older and preferably a quieter home. A secured fenced yard would be needed for exercise and bathroom breaks, the rest of the time, he must be indoors.\n\nRockwell is current on basic vaccinations including Bordetella, been dewormed and is microchipped. He has tested POSITIVE for Heartworms. He will need to be on Heartworm prevention for the rest of his life and stay as mostly an indoor dog. He has been started on the slow kill medications for Heartworm at the time of his neuter.\n\nRockwell has now been neutered as of  12/15/20 and has received his required Rabies vaccination. \n\nFor more information, please contact the City of Corsicana Animal Shelter at (903) 654-4928. The shelter is open Mon, Tues, Thurs and Fri from 12:00pm - 6:00pm and on Sat from 12:00pm - 4:00pm.",

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: 08/01/2020\nReason for being in rescue: Lavender and her 3 babies were seized as part of a hoarding case. Carolina Poodle Rescue partnered with a local shelter to help her and her babies.\nFoster location: Foster Home in Raleigh, NC\nSpecial Needs? Lavendar was spayed and had a dental on 9/25/20. Her days of making babies are over and she's ready for her forever home. Lavender requires an owner experienced with chihuahuas.\nWeight: 8.5 lbs\nHeight: 9 in\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $200\n\nFence needed? No, but she would love one\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Lavendar is a shy but very loving girl. She needs an experienced dog owner that has patience to earn Lavendar's trust. Once she trusts you, she is yours! Lavender is not for a first time dog owner. She is not for a home with children. This mama is looking for a quiet home where she will be the lap princess. Lavender needs another dog in the home. As she has come out of her shell she seeks out her foster siblings and loves to play and run with them. Other dogs help her build confidence.\n\nLavendar cannot live in an apartment or any other dwelling with shared walls. Her voice is simply too much. It will take Lavendar at least 5 days to settle into her forever home. For the first 5 days she will be nervous, anxious, and may even show her teeth. Change is very hard for this girl. Patience and calm are required for a successful adoption.\n\nWhat is my personality like? Lavender arrived in rescue as a very shy but calm mama with 3 very young babies. Given the age of her babies she was moved to a foster home immediately. Lavender was the best mom!! She was so nurturing and sweet to her babies. Now that they've found their forever home, it is this mama's turn.\n\nLavendar has really come out of her shell in her foster home. She loves to sleep in the bed, way down under the covers. She loves to play with toys. She loves to run zoomies in the yard with her foster siblings. She is incredibly food motivated and will work for treats. Lavendar wants to be where people are. Though she can be skittish, her heart is big and gentle and she loves with every ounce of it.\n\nLavendar has a voice. It is loud. Very loud. She is learning not to use it as much and responds when her foster mom talks to her. But her new owner understands this girl has a lot to say and sometimes it sounds like a screech. Lavendar is better with women, but warms up to men. Men have to put in more work to earn her trust.\n\nLavendar does not handle change well. She was adopted once but returned after less than 48 hours when she simply couldn't make the transition. We all learned a lot from this experience. Lavendar MUST have a home with an experienced chihuahua owner that understands the breed. She WILL be a nervous wreck and act crazily for the first 72 hours; then she will settle down. This girl is wonderful - she just has to get comfortable.\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Shy but curious.\n\nOther tips and tidbits: Lavender's estimated birthday is 9/23/2018\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

I am only 34 lbs right now, but I am very skinny. The shelter has been taking good care of me to get me back into the best shape. In addition to me being found very skinny, I was also found to have Heartworms. Thankfully for me, The Humane Society of Marion County will treat me for this (Please ask Kennel Staff or the Front Desk about Heartworm Fostering). Since I was a stray, not a lot is known about me or my past. I can be a little nervous and stiff around other dogs, perhaps I'll come around in time. I am not a fan of cats and I have not been tested for my temperament around children yet. I do like treats and will gladly 'sit' for you. If you think I'm cute and you want to give me the best life, please ask a Kennel Staff Member to arrange a meet and greet for us. Thanks!\n\nLove, \nNoah",

Brooklyn's favorite activity at the center is taking walks with volunteers but this wiggle butt often spends more time getting belly rubs then covering much ground! Although she lives for humans she does need to be the only pet in the home. This gal is house trained, microchipped, spayed and up-to-date on her vaccines. Brooklyn has put on her sweater and is ready to go home so please call the Montgomery County Animal Care and Adoption Center at 382-5795 ext 1 to make your appointment to meet her today!If you are interested in learning more about this pet, call the Montgomery County, Virginia, Animal Care and Adoption Center at 540-382-5795.",

            "description": "Kimiko (Kimmie) is a blue and white female Pit Bull, born September 2019. She was found as a stray in Missouri. Kimmie is a playful girl, who can be mouthy while playing therefore she needs a home with no kids under the age of 12. Kimmie is house trained, kennel trained, great with all pets. She can jump a 4ft fence with no problem, so a 6ft privacy fence would be best. Kimmie is currently undergoing heartworm treatment while in foster, and is excited to find her perfect home to start her future fresh start in.\n\nBefore applying to adopt Kimiko, you need to be familiar with your local breed-specific legislation regarding Pit Bulls. Applicants must live within 50 miles of the Omaha/Council Bluffs area.\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Kimiko is $400. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

            "description": "Are you in search of a friendly, energetic companion to go on adventures with you? Look no further! Meet Lucy, a 1 year old Border Collie mix weighing in at 40lbs.\n\nLucy is currently in a foster home in the Olympia, Washington area. To apply, please fill out an application at www.doggedly.org/adoption-app\n\nLucy is a beautiful, young Border Collie mix with a beautiful, silky black coat and piercing golden eyes. This stunning girl is very young, estimated to be around 1 year old and has a lot of love to give! Sadly, Lucy was found as a stray and ended up in a high kill shelter pregnant. The stress of the shelter caused Lucy to go into labor and she gave birth to 5 beautiful puppies in the shelter clinic. Due to Lucy's young age, we believe that she became pregnant during her very \n first heat cycle, ultimately setting up her newborn puppies for a rough life.\n\nLuckily for Lucy, she was pulled by Doggedly within a day of giving birth and placed with an experienced foster home to nurse her newborn babies. This didn't go as planned, and sadly Lucy was infested with parasites, which she passed on to her babies through her breast milk. Within days, her puppies started to cry in pain with bloody diarrhea. Lucy was absolutely distraught and being a new mom, had no idea what to do. She picked up her puppies and carried them around one at a time in a panic, before ultimately rejecting her litter and denying them milk. Two of Lucy's puppies died within the first 10 days of birth. The last 3 were taken in for emergency care with blood transfusions and hospitalization. Unfortunately, the runt baby passed and only two male puppies remained. Lucy's 2 surviving puppies are about 4 weeks old and were bottle fed with a foster. They are thriving and doing amazing.\n\nOnce Lucy's milk dried up, we spayed her, since she was already separated from her pups. Since then, this magnificent young pup has been enjoying the spoiled life in her foster home.\n\nLucy is as easy as it comes with high energy herding breeds. She is energetic, excited and loves to chase balls, play with toys and loves the company of other dogs. Lucy is wonderful on a leash, loves car rides and outdoors adventures. She would be an amazing running partner and has the drive and stamina as a herding breed to keep up with your daily activity. True to her breed, Lucy will require more exercise and mental stimulation than other breeds, as a highly intelligent and energetic girl. Her ideal home would have 1 or more energetic dogs, or the opportunity to socialize often. Due to her rambunctious nature, we recommend that Lucy only be placed with older children. Lucy has not been tested with cats.\n\nLucy is extremely intelligent and highly food motivated. Her highest motivator is praise, and she wants so badly to please her humans. This silly girl will roll over at the slightest hint of a belly rub, which is her favorite thing on the planet! At times, Lucy still behaves like a high energy puppy. She would do best in a home with the time and resources to dedicate to basic training and beyond, since she is a working breed.",

Like her momma, Ham, she's a sucker not only for fowl and swine, Pork Chop loves people. Warning: if you let her, she'll bathe you in kisses as soon as she meets you! Delightfully exuberant, anxious to greet everyone, she's a little excitable at first, but not overwhelming. A good walker, if Pork Chop's in a group and one of you falls behind she looks back to see if you're coming and doesn't mind waiting for you to catch up. Apparently the party can't go on unless everyone's present! Pork Chop sits on command without treats, but what she'd really like is to sit in your lap. She's a big sweetheart! Pork Chop's adoption fee is $125 and helps cover the cost of her spay, vaccinations, worming, monthly heart worm, flea and tick preventive, microchip and care while at CCHS. Who wouldn't want to wake up or come home to such a loving and vivacious girl as Pork Chop?",

Andy comes to his name, and knows many commands including sit, stay and down! Andy was seen by our private vet and is a very healthy boy about 7 yrs old. He had torn a ligament on his knee, and we got him the surgery that he needs. His recovery is going well and he is back to normal. He currently weighs about 60 lbs. He has a lean body with slim legs. Andy likes to play with his toys, but isn't rambunctious. Andy is house trained, knows many commands. Andy is a loving dog who deserves a home. Unfortunately, we have to board Andy because we do not have any available foster homes. Andy deserves better than that, and we are eager to find him a foster or forever home. He should go to an adult home as an only dog. He wants to be an alpha dog, so should go to a home with doggie experience. Andy has worked with a trainer, and is ready to go the right home. He is very loving and playful, and can be quite the sweetheart. He just needs an experienced adopter who can give him the structure and exercise. Andy is fully vaccinated, neutered, and microchipped. If you live in the Los Angeles area and would like to meet Andy, please complete our adoption application found on dexterfoundation.com If you can't adopt, can you at least foster, or know someone who can? We need a foster or adopter in the Los Angeles area. Thanks for sharing.",

            "description": "Meet Starlight, an adorable 8 month old fluff who had a very rough start to life. Starlight is a poodle chihuahua mix weighing in at just under 10lbs. She was found a stray with brother Midnight as a sickly puppy living in a pile of trash.\n\nStarlight is currently in the greater Seattle area. We would love for both pups to be adopted together, or go into a home with one or more playful pups the same size. To apply to adopt Starlight apply at  www.doggedly.org/adoption-app\n\nStarlight and her brother Midnight were found at just 3 weeks old, living in a pile of garbage in the streets of Mexico. A Good Samaritan found the pair and brought them back to Texas, but both puppies soon became extremely ill. Midnight was the worst of the pair, screaming in pain with a tight, sore stomach. As it turns out, Midnight was infested with intestinal parasites and was given to a rescue, where he was rushed to the vet for medical care. Midnight suffered from seizures, diarrhea, anemia and hypoglycemia from an extreme parasite overload for such a small, frail puppy. He was dewormed, given antibiotics and seizure medications to stabilize him and was tube fed until he gained strength. Midnight was hospitalized for a month to be tube fed and have his blood sugar levels monitored, as would suddenly go limp from low blood sugar. His sister Starlight received fluid therapy, antibiotics and deworming and was able to leave to a foster home after a week. \n\nWhen both pups were finally healthy enough to be reunited with a foster home, they needed round the clock care from a medical foster. Both puppies were hypoglycemic and would become cold and limp if not feed consistently. They still had large, wormy bellies and needed to be dewormed weekly, as they consistently had diarrhea and digestive issues for the first few months, which put them at risk for anemia and dehydration. These little pups were fighters and beat the odds of survival, weighing in at only 1lb at 4 weeks old when they first came into the rescue. Starlight and Midnight are now 6 months old, active and extremely healthy little love bugs. They are both ready to finally leave the nest and find their forever homes.\n\nStarlight and Midnight are both extremely social dogs, that enjoy the company of larger dogs, cats and children. Due to their small size, we do require a home with kids over than 6 years old. Larger dogs will be considered on a case by case basis, based on temperament around small dogs. Starlight is an extremely confident puppy that loves to play. Midnight is the baby of the pair, since he spent the beginning of his life being handled and tube fed, he knows that he is a little prince and loves to be spoiled. Both dogs are extremely friendly, curious and adore their humans. They love to play and tap dance for meal time. As much as they love each other, both pups are now old enough to go to separate homes. They would also thrive together, as they have been separated long enough to develop separately from one another with no concerns for littermate syndrome. Starlight and Midnight are both very independent, rambunctious little pups that are ready to take on and explore the world!\n\nBoth puppies are currently learning to potty train and are trained to pee on potty pads. They are kennel trained and have started to leash train. They love short walks in the grass, and absolutely adore little adventures where they can explore outdoors.\n\nStarlight is spayed, microchipped, and has received 3 rounds of puppy boosters, Bordetella vaccine, Canine Influenza vaccines, plus rabies vaccine. Puppy kindergarten classes are included in his adoption fee. Starlight has no known food allergies, but she can be a picky eater. She does require a high quality diet formulated for toy breeds (she is currently eating Fromm Gold Puppy Small Breed with wet food and fish oil), to fuel her growing puppy body. Her beautiful wiry coat is low maintenance, but does require regular bathing and brushing retain it's soft and shiny glow. A home familiar with extra small breed dogs is preferred.",

            "description": "Meet Midnight, an adorable 8 month old fluff who had a very rough start to life. Midnight is a poodle chihuahua mix weighing in at just under 10lbs. He was found a stray with his sister Starlight as a sickly puppy living in a pile of trash.\n\nMidnight is currently in the greater Seattle area. We would love for both pups to be adopted together, or go into a home with one or more playful pups the same size. Apply to adopt Midnight at  www.doggedly.org/adoption-app\n\nMidnight and his sister Starlight were found at just 3 weeks old, living in a pile of garbage in the streets of Mexico. A Good Samaritan found the pair and brought them back to Texas, but both puppies soon became extremely ill. Midnight was the worst of the pair, screaming in pain with a tight, sore stomach. As it turns out, Midnight was infested with intestinal parasites and was given to a rescue, where he was rushed to the vet for medical care. Midnight suffered from seizures, diarrhea, anemia and hypoglycemia from an extreme parasite overload for such a small, frail puppy. He was dewormed, given antibiotics and seizure medications to stabilize him and was tube fed until he gained strength. Midnight was hospitalized for a month to be tube fed and have his blood sugar levels monitored, as would suddenly go limp from low blood sugar. His sister Starlight received fluid therapy, antibiotics and deworming and was able to leave to a foster home after a week. \n\nWhen both pups were finally healthy enough to be reunited with a foster home, they needed round the clock care from a medical foster. Both puppies were hypoglycemic and would become cold and limp if not feed consistently. They still had large, wormy bellies and needed to be dewormed weekly, as they consistently had diarrhea and digestive issues for the first few months, which put them at risk for anemia and dehydration. These little pups were fighters and beat the odds of survival, weighing in at only 1lb at 4 weeks old when they first came into the rescue. Starlight and Midnight are now 6 months old, active and extremely healthy little love bugs. They are both ready to finally leave the nest and find their forever homes.\n\nStarlight and Midnight are both extremely social dogs, that enjoy the company of larger dogs, cats and children. Due to their small size, we do require a home with kids over than 6 years old. Larger dogs will be considered on a case by case basis, based on temperament around small dogs. Starlight is an extremely confident puppy that loves to play. Midnight is the baby of the pair, since he spent the beginning of his life being handled and tube fed, he knows that he is a little prince and loves to be spoiled. Both dogs are extremely friendly, curious and adore their humans. They love to play and tap dance for meal time. As much as they love each other, both pups are now old enough to go to separate homes. They would also thrive together, as they have been separated long enough to develop separately from one another with no concerns for littermate syndrome. Starlight and Midnight are both very independent, rambunctious little pups that are ready to take on and explore the world!\n\nBoth puppies are currently learning to potty train and are trained to pee on potty pads. They are kennel trained and have started to leash train. They love short walks in the grass, and absolutely adore little adventures where they can explore outdoors.\n\nMidnight is neutered, microchipped, and has received 3 rounds of puppy boosters, Bordetella vaccine, Canine Influenza vaccines, plus his rabies vaccine. Puppy kindergarten classes are included in his adoption fee. Midnight has no known food allergies, but he can be a picky eater. He does require a high quality diet formulated for toy breeds (he is currently eating Fromm Gold Puppy Small Breed with wet food and fish oil), to fuel his growing puppy body. His beautiful fluffy coat needs to be groomed regularly to avoid mats and to retain it's soft and shiny glow. A home familiar with extra small breed dogs is preferred.",

We picked Alvin up on November 17, 2020, and he has been a worthy little guy who doesn't object to handling and being picked up, and he's good with his tiny canine companion. He's chubby at 19 pounds, especially for a Chiweenie-type dog, which is what he appears to be.",

Woodstock came to us via Operation Helping Hounds which helps relocate homeless hounds from high-kill shelters in the SouthEastern US to the West Coast where hounds aren't as common. \n\nWoodstock is a very sweet, affectionate, long-legged boy who loves long walks and chasing after balls. He knows his basic commands and the volunteers are polishing up his leash training. Check out the video of Woodstock on our weekly Shelter Dog Hike! Come meet him at our Costa Mesa location.\n\n---\nWe know there are some 3rd party websites giving mis-information on the location of the pet you may be interested in. For correct information, please visit the location of the animal's name listed directly after their name, and visit the bio for more information. Thank you!! (Ex: \"Sparky - Chino Hills Location will mean you go to Chino Hills; \"Fluffy - Claremont Location will mean you go to Claremont; and \"Fido - Costa Mesa Location will mean you go to Costa Mesa) There may also be mis-information about the status of an available pet.

He\u2019s quiet and mellow, and perfectly content to just sit quietly by your side. Skippy makes a perfect couch companion, he\u2019s mellow and calm, and doesn\u2019t ask for much. \n\nSkippy was rescued from the shelter where he had been overlooked because he was scared, and often hid in his cubby. He\u2019s still a little shy, but he enjoys soft petting, and is fine being picked up as long as he\u2019s approached slowly.  \n\nSkippy gets along well with other dogs, rides nicely in a car, and appears to be housetrained.  He has been diagnosed with kidney disease and requires a special diet and sub q fluids several times a week. Skippy will make an ideal best buddy and companion.  \n\nSkippy is neutered, up to date on shots, dental, bloodwork, fecal tested, and microchipped. \n\nAdoption process includes application, interview, home visit, contract and donation.\n\nLos Angeles area adoptions only\n",

            "description": "Dancer has had a rough young life, and a rough road to recovery\u2026Dancer is a beautiful 1 yr old blond golden who was surrendered to GRRAND by owners in southern Indiana who were unable to manage the expense of her medical needs. They had only acquired Dancer 5 months earlier from another owner and while with them she became very sick. They spent $1,500 on her with 2 different vet clinics who were unable to diagnose her illness. Dancer has severely swollen joints and nose, bleeding sores and ruptures to her skin, had to have an eye removed because it also became infected, and lameness. When GRRAND acquired this sweet girl, we took her immediately to the emergency vet where she was quickly diagnosed with Blastomycosis, a severe fungal disease that is systemic and oftentimes fatal. The fungus is acquired from wet or moist soil, often around ponds. Dancer\u2019s former owners said that she loved to dig in the pond on their property! Dancer is now on expensive medications to treat the fungus and we hope that her therapy has come soon enough to save her life, and her other eye. This girl is in a lot of pain, but continues to be nothing but total sweetness. She is in a wonderful foster home with a foster mom who is monitoring her progress around the clock. We are so grateful that at this time, Dancer continues to eat and drink and doesn\u2019t seem to require hospitalization. We are looking for donations to cover the cost of Dancer\u2019s treatment which will extend for many months, perhaps as long as a year or so.\n\nAt this time, we are unable to process any applications that are outside of the geographic areas listed below:\nGreater Louisville, KY (including adjacent southern Indiana)\nGreater Lexington, KY\nSouthern Indiana Counties:  Clark and Floyd\nOhio Counties: Hamilton, Butler, Warren, some areas within Clermont county, Montgomery and Green\nNorthern KY Counties: Boone, Kenton and Campbell\n \nTo inquire about a specific dog, we require that you first submit an adoption application.  Visit http://grrand.org/online-adoption-application/  to access our online application.  You do not need to fill out an application for each dog you are interested in learning more about.  Once your application is reviewed a GRRAND volunteer will contact you to begin the process.  Our Adoption Placement Coordinator will work with you to find a dog with the characteristics to best fit your family.",

            "description": "Meet Maggie!\n\nSugar Magnolia (Maggie) - This Olde English Bulldog beauty queen is 5 years old, and sweet as can be. She will become your shadow in the house, with a cute nub tail wiggling furiously behind her whenever she looks at you. At other times, she will simply lean into you, and it\u2019s impossible to resist bending down to give her love. Her size is substantial, but she is very much a lap dog. \n\nMaggie is very well-behaved, and will fit into most homes from Day 1. If you work from home, she will usually lay in a dog bed next to you, either quietly chewing a bone or loudly taking a nap. She doesn\u2019t mind spending time in her kennel, and has always lived in a home so she is very well-mannered. Maggie was surrendered because she cannot be in a home with other animals, especially dogs. Her reaction is significant enough that her new home will need to proactively ensure that there are never dogs in her proximity (including on walks, at the vet, etc\u2026), but these accommodations are not necessarily that onerous, especially for homebodies. However, she will need to be in a home with no children who are more prone to accidentally leaving a door open. If you\u2019d like to meet Maggie, please fill out an application at NewOrleansBulldogs.com/adopt.\n\nAll of our dogs come fully-vaccinated, temperament-tested, and resources to set you and your dog up for success when adopting. Thank you for your support of our rescue!",

            "description": "Eli is a year and a half old male pit bull in need of his forever to start. You see, he thought he had it when he was first adopted as a puppy, but sadly he has found his way back to Partners because his big clumsy body kept knocking over his human brother. (Oops!) Eli is good with kids, but he doesn't know his own strength! A home with older kids will be the best for for Eli. Eli so badly wants to play with other dogs, but he's got some socializing and learning to do before being adopted into a home with another dog. He will need a home without cats. He's a sweet baby that just needs a little guidance and some patience! Do you think you could spare some for this handsome little butterball turkey?? Eli's adoption fee is $195, and he is neutered, microchipped and current on all vaccines.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting please go to our website at www.partnersforpetsil.org and fill out an online application.\n\nAdoptions are held at the O'Fallon, IL PetSmart every Saturday of the month from 11am-3:30pm and at the Glen Carbon, IL PetSmart every Sunday from 11am-3:30pm. We are also at Petco in Edwardsville Crossing on Sundays from 11:30-3:30 pm. The cats are only at Glen Carbon Petsmart. Please let us know if you are interested in a pet and we can arrange to have them meet you at one of the adoption events.",

She is a beautiful Rottie/Shepherd mix and making slow progress learning that not all people are bad. She loves taking treats as long as it is in a safe place, i.e. her kennel is her sanctuary. She will walk with you in a harness very cautiously and still gets startled at loud noises and sudden movements. It is very important that her permanent home has another confident doggy buddy to help her bloom. This is not a fast track type of rehab for MaBelle and she is hoping a family with experience and lots of patience will see her and be ready to commit to bringing her out of her shell. She deserves to be showered with abundant love and tenderness. She will show you forever love in return.\n\n \n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit our website and complete an adoption application at www.elpasocountycanine.org/available-dogs",

            "description": "Amelia, who answers to Momma, is done raising her babies and has finished her heartworm treatment with flying colors. She is a sweetheart who is fully housebroken, loves playing tug-o-war, and can be heard snoring on the couch. Speaking of couch, she sleeps through the night on the couch and will sleep till you come wake her. \n\nThe best home for her would be a home with familiar with pitties. Her bark definitely sounds intimidating as she sees other dogs outside, but she has gotten along wonderfully with the resident dog in her foster home. When she\u2019s not napping, she has lots of energy so a fenced in yard is needed. She\u2019s a love to kids, but because she loves to play and sometimes doesn\u2019t know where the toy stops and your hand begins, she needs a home with no young kids.\n\nTo be considered the first step is to apply here: https://www.pawsup4rescue.org/dog-cat-applicaiton \n\nWe are located in Joliet Illinois and require adopters be within a 100 mile radius to adopt. If your app is picked we will be in touch by phone to set up a private meet.  If the dog is adopted we will post the adoption pic. Information on fees can be found here: https://www.pawsup4rescue.org/",

He loves other dogs, and would do great in a home with other dogs or as an only dog. He doesn't exhibit signs of separation anxiety, and doesn't really make noise at all! He lets you sleep in and wakes up when you're ready to wake up! He loves to go on runs and bikes and play/run at the dog park. \n\n\"He needs more work with leash manners and gets distracted by passing dogs. In the two weeks I've been watching him he's been responding well to training and whoever adopts him will want to commit to continuing his training. When you drive in the car, his favorite thing to do is shove his head through the seat and rest his head on your shoulder.\"",

            "description": "Ginger is a 1.5 year old timid girl that is super sweet and well behaved.  She is a little leery of new dogs and would probably do best in a home that either has no other dogs or has calm well behaved dogs.  She was picked on by the other dogs in her previous home.  She walks well on a leash and seems pretty calm.  She is very well-behaved.  She just needs a calm quiet home where she can learn to trust people and other dogs again.  Ginger is a stellar car rider and will curl up in the seat next to you for her ride and not move until you call her.  \n\nThe standard adoption fee for a puppy or a dog is $200 which includes  rabies vaccination, at least one round of parvo distemper vaccine and spay or neuter.   ARF will adopt to residents who are out of state but will not furnish transportation.  Here are a few of our adoption requirements:  All adopters will be asked to fill out an  application. Adopters must be at least 21 years old. Renters must show proof that they are allowed to have pets, such as a rental agreement. If there is a pet deposit, please show us the receipt that this has been paid. Be prepared to take your pet home with you - bring a leash for all dogs, regardless of age or size (or a pet taxi for small puppies and dogs) and a pet taxi for all kittens and cats. \n\nFill out this form if you are interested in adopting a pet from Animal Rescue Foundation. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10mHOUH71ulyBm-xh0HZcOGsusvXJxrS3pXQHCz3f-tQ/viewform?edit_requested=true",

I\u2019ve learned a lot about trusting people again in my foster home and I can\u2019t wait to find a quiet, experienced human (or two!) who can give me all the love and adoration I so much deserve. \n\nI have a pretty medium amount of energy and will be active when you feel like being active, but will laze about if you\u2019re relaxing. I also have a nice voice and like to sing along with passing ambulances. I love to play tug and chew on my toys, but cuddling with my people is the best. I do fine when my foster parents are away from the house but I just love when they\u2019re home to give me all the love. \n\nI do bond really well with my humans and am affectionate and happy overall. However, new people still make me nervous and I need a slow introduction to new people overall. I\u2019ve learned SO much in my foster home and my foster parents really helped me build confidence with treats, redirection, and other positive reinforcement training. However, I can be reactive to strangers walking by me (men more so than women) so I need thoughtful management on walks and a slow introduction to visitors in the house (once I trust you in the house, I\u2019m great!) I also need to be in a home where there are adults only since my need to warm up isn\u2019t the right match for kids. I\u2019m also really uncomfortable at vet visits so I need an understanding vet and a thoughtful plan for any vet visits. \n\nI also am not a fan of other dogs and react to them when I\u2019m on leash and in the house. Therefore, I need to be the only animal in the home and I can\u2019t be in an apartment as I need that private yard space where I can relax and not interact with other dogs. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a pup who can just be your best friend, who will always be by your side, and you have experience with positive reinforcement and a general patience for pups who need some extra patience and love, I\u2019d be such a lovely match for you! Please email my friends at adopt@pawscoadoptions.org and check out this information page: https://pawsco.org/adopt/adoption-process.\n\n",

DOB 11-17-16), female, 38 lbs., vetted, is or will be spayed, and micro-chipped. Slinky's owner was detained at a quick stop in NC and Slinky found herself at the County shelter! She was very scared and confused! Slinky is hesitant and takes some time to warm up and would be best in a home with older kids that won't scare her. She is good with other dogs and we are not yet sure about cats but guess she might be ok. Stay tuned for more information as Slinky is a new rescue!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Slinky please fill out an Application at\n\nwww.Passion-4-Paws.org\n\n(please make sure you have the Vermont site not CT) - thanks!\n\nPlease note Fosters have 1st option of Adoption\n\nCheck out her Facebook page (please \"Like\" us while you are there)!\n\nDisclosure:\n\nBreed labels are often incorrect: we rarely know the genetic lineage of the dogs we rescue. Many shelters and rescues specify breeds based on appearance; however, research has shown that less than 2% of a dog's DNA determines appearance!\n\nPassion 4 Paws does not practice the use of labels pertaining to compatibility with others or dog breed. Labels such as \"dog friendly\" and \"child friendly\" should be used with caution as they often over-simplify the personalities and behavior of dogs.",

I thought they were coming with us because our collars and leashes were still attached, but they just drove off!  Despite this heartbreaking betrayal, I LOVE people!  I\u2019m a velcro dog that loves cuddling with humans and I expect belly rubs.  While I do well with other pups, I am more interested in you so I might not be a playmate for another pup in your home but will co-exist just fine. While I enjoy my naps while you are home working or chilling out watching football on the couch, I do have quite a bit of energy so I need someone who will make sure I get exercise. I\u2019m making progress on my potty training but it\u2019s still in progress.  So far I\u2019m not much of a barker or chewer, but I\u2019m still getting settled in at my foster home.  I have not yet been introduced to a crate, so if you plan to crate me, a slow and gradual introduction would be needed. My foster mom says I\u2019m one of the most adoptable dogs she\u2019s had the pleasure of fostering, so you better hurry up and apply for me!  The rescue gets 100s of emails a day so the best first step is to fill out the adoption application which is required prior to a phone call and meet and greet: \n\nhttps://nhanimalrescue.org/adoption-information/",

            "description": "Lucy is 9-year-old dog (doesn\u2019t act like it at all!) surrendered from a good family whose situation changed.  She has settled in very nicely with her foster family & always wants to be where the family is, but she is happy to watch events from the comfort of her dog bed.  At several points during the day she gets up and does a check to make sure she knows where every member of the family is and, once everyone is accounted for, she settles down in the room with the most occupants.  \n\nLucy loves snuggles: if you sit down on the floor you\u2019ll find yourself with a dog in your lap in no time, and on the rare occasion you invite her onto the couch or bed with you, she\u2019ll be up in a heartbeat and will certainly not be the first to leave.  She will never turn down a scratch behind her ears, but she is also not demanding of attention. \n \nLucy is a calm and steady household presence.  She lives with 2 young boys and the commotion of the busy house is of no bother to her.   \n \nShe has good household manners: she knows sit and down, she waits well at the door, she is a hopeful presence at the dinner table but does not beg.  She does not jump on people or lick.  She rarely barks in the home.  We do find her on the couch occasionally.  \n\nLucy does not love the crate but after a minute or two of whining she settles right down and then is fine in the crate through the night or for a couple of hours during the day. \n \nDespite Lucy\u2019s steadiness, she is an enthusiastic greeter when anyone returns home after being out, she has a boundless puppy enthusiasm for food, and she still loves to get outside and run and chase squirrels and birds, and she can\u2019t resist a squeaky toy.  On leash, she likes to be nose-down and on-the-scent so walks are purposeful rather than casual.  In the yard she barks at every passerby whether person, dog, or car (though she does not bark when on leash).\n \nLucy would be best in a household that wants a quiet dog to be a faithful by-your-side companion.  She would be fine in a household with children of any age.  She much prefers running free in the yard to walks, so a home with a fenced yard is preferable.  \n\nLucy did live with another dog, but that dog was placed before we evaluated her. We noticed in her initial foster home that she does not seem to be very comfortable around other dogs.  She is probably best in a single-dog household. She did display some resource guarding issues with her food both towards children and other dogs when there were other dogs in the home:in her presence. Her original owner confirmed the same.  However, current foster hasn't seen any display of this at all (there are no other dogs in the home). So we do think she would be best as a single dog but would be open to a meet and greet with another dog if the family was committed to feeding her separate and understood they\u2019re may not be able to be toys/high value items in her possession when other dogs are present.  \n\nIf you are interested  in meeting Lucy please submit an adoption application at: www.GSPrescuenj.com.  \n",

He knows sit, down, stay, leave it and drop it. Renzo loves to play (especially fetch) and is the energizer bunny while outdoors but as soon as he is indoors, he is mellow as can be.\n\nRenzo is super friendly with people. He loves giving kisses and being pet but can be very stubborn, as most huskies are, so he needs to be in a husky savvy home with a confident owner that can give him gentle correcting. He also has typical husky talk, and will tell you like it is. He and the female Siberian Husky, he currently lives with in his foster home, have contests to see who can talk the loudest.\n\nRenzo would do best with a calmer, female dog, or being the only dog in the home. He does have a bit of resource guarding when it comes to food and treats but easily manageable by giving him commands and feeding him separately away from other dogs.\n\nRenzo is the best pup, does not dig outdoors and does not chew up anything inside or out. How can you pass up a husky that doesn't dig or chew?! Renzo is looking for someone to give him the best life that he deserves and to have an owner that will always be by his side, something that he hasn't had much of in the past.\n\nWhen you hear the phrase, \"Man's best friend\", Renzo fits that to a T.",

What a shame for them. Continuing with the reindeer names, Prancer is quite a character and yes she does prance, jumped into the crate in the back of the truck, went willingly into the vet and otherwise was a very well behaved young lady at 2-3 years and about 50 pounds.\n\nPrancer is a very loving dog who knows her basic commands and would do great with active lifestyle owner. Though she gets along with dogs she will react back if challenged. She would do great in a single dog household environment. She walks great on leash with some correction in beginning. Do not recommend around kids. She is ready for her new home with a knowledgeable savvy husky owner.",

We can't imagine how scary all of these changes were in her life. Sophie has acclimated in her foster home, but can be a little shy when first meeting new people. Sophie seems to enjoy the company of other dogs in her foster home, and it's helped with her transition. Sophie loves going for daily walks with her foster mom and snuggling up on the couch for TV time in the evenings.  The best type of home for Sophie would be one that is on the calm side, no young kids, another dog is a plus but not a must. Sophie is fully vetted which includes a dental so her mouth will be in tip top kissing shape!\n\nSophie\u2019s adoption fee is $300 and that includes her spay, microchip, vaccines current, deworming, flea treatment and dental. Apply to meet her at www.lovebugsrescue.org\n",

            "description": "Hello, my name is Snow, as in Snow White.  I am about 13 lbs, 4 years old, sweet, and playful.  I am looking for a home along with my brother Charming (Prince Charming).\n\nI was one of 9 puppies born after our mommy was pulled from a very high kill shelter in Houston, TX (on the day she was to be put to sleep, as she was very pregnant with us, and they had no place for her).  I was born 10/7/2016.  My siblings and I have been trying to find homes in Houston since we were little, but it is very hard to find people there that want to take care of us the right way.  We sat at hundreds of events, and people would say how cute we were, but we never found our places.  We have 4 siblings that found their forever families in the PNW, now it is our turn. \n\nI am super sweet.  I can be a little bit shy at first, and will need a few days to acclimate to new situations, but once I trust my people, things are great.  My brother is the same way, so we are not the best candidates for doggie day cares and dog parks.  We play very well together, and will play with toys with our people,and that is plenty of entertainment.  We are still on the smaller side, so we will need people to accompany us outside to potty/ etc.  We do know how to use potty pads too (as long as they are not on carpet\u2026 sometimes they confuse where the edge is if on carpet).  Potty pads can be a great option if there is yucky weather/etc.  I am not used to children, so small children will not be a good thing for us.  I loooovvve kitties.  Sometimes I love them a bit too much\u2026 I lick all over their faces sometimes to show them how much I love them, and for some reason, some of them don\u2019t like this.  I would never hurt them, and have been around them my whole life\u2026 I wish they understood that.  Some do.  Some let me kiss them and play with me and let me snuggle with them.  One kitten I recently met, chased me too\u2026. It was SO FUN!!!!  If I didn\u2019t love my brother as much as I do, the rescue was going to say we should go to a new home together we did so well lol.  They couldn\u2019t find the kitty, and panicked running outside at 3 am etc, thinking maybe somehow he got out, but found him cuddling in my bed with me.  It was kind of funny to us.   Well, that is all for now\u2026 time to go play.  Let my rescue people know if you\u2019d like to meet me, and after you fill out an application to be an approved adopter, they will schedule a time for us to meet each other.  They will bring me to your house, as that is the best environment to meet in.  Oh, I am fully vetted and up to date on my healthcare too.  Please try to be within an hour (or close to that) of the Seattle area.\n\nAdoption fee:  $600 each (this includes a few months of heartworm/ flea medication, a leash/ harness for her, having recently refreshed vaccines (including a 3 year rabies vaccine), and a few other supplies)",

Barron is about 7 years old. We see some Lab and possibly some Great Dane in Barron, and who knows what else. He's a bit underweight, he should weigh about 80 lbs at a healthy weight. Barron likes to play, loves kids and enjoys belly rubs and a nice snooze on the sofa. He happily supervises kids' sleepovers. He's being fostered with our beloved Queen Caroline, whom he adores. He loves toys. Barron is housebroken, crate trained, already knows \"sit\" and \"shake\" and just an all around great dog. Barron is good with other big dogs but not good with small dogs or cats. If you'd like to meet Barron, please fill out a foster-to-adopt application at\ndreamhouserescue.org.\n\nAll of our fully-vetted adoptable dogs go to prospective homes for a one-week trial foster-to-adopt period to make sure the dog and home are the right fit before an adoption is finalized. We only adopt dogs into homes where all current pets are spayed/neutered and current on vaccines and heartworm and flea and tick prevention. We do check veterinary references to make sure adopters are compliant with standard veterinary care.",

The adopter is the alpha member of the pack, and the dog or puppy needs as much one-on-one contact with the alpha as possible. For this reason, all Route 66 Rescue Inc. dogs are adopted to inside homes only. They must be on leash, or inside a secure fence when outside, and not left outside alone when no one is home. Invisible fencing does not qualify as protection since other animals and strangers have access to the dog. The dogs must be returned to Route 66 Rescue, Inc. if ever given up by the adopter. Thank you for understanding we want only the best for the dogs you give a forever home.\n\nElle is one of eleven puppies abandoned at two weeks of age.  The puppies have been bottle raised and in foster homes, and are now ready for adoption.  They have had their first two sets of three puppy vaccinations.  At this time, they can only be adopted in the general Springfield, Nixa, Ozark area.   In order to adopt now, the adopter must be able to get Elle to her last vet appointment at Best Friends Animal Hospital in Ozark on January 19, for her last DA2PPV, rabies vaccination, and her spay.  She will need to be at Best Friends between 7:30 and 8:00, and picked up after three that day. \n\nElle has been exposed to house cats, and although curious, she does not chase them. She is a snuggler, and a very intelligent puppy.  She loves her sister, Vee, and would love to be adopted with her.  The girls are already fairly good about using pee pads and a potty patch with ASTRO turf\n\nElle will make a wonderful addition to any family with children over ten years of age.\n \nPlease complete and return the adoption application to meet Elle, or any of our adoptable dogs.\nhttp://www.route66rescueinc.com/adoption-application.html Thank you for visiting our site.

She would love to find a cozy home where she can bond with her forever human. She would most likely prefer to be the only animal in the home, as she doesn't really care for cats and is selective about her dog friends. She also doesn't like to share...Other than that, she is about as perfect as they come! Penny loves car rides and cuddles, but could use some training walking on a leash.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, and would like to make an appointment for a meet and greet, please fill out and submit our Canine Adoption Application on our website:\n\nhttps://www.apsfh.com/adoption-program/canine-application/\n\nCOVID-19: Due to the ongoing pandemic, APS-FH will be giving priority to local adopters, however an application must be submitted prior to any meet and greets.",

She will need to be at Best Friends between 7:30 and 8:00, and picked up after three that day. \n\nVee has been exposed to house cats, and although curious, she does not chase them. She is a snuggler, and a very intelligent puppy.  She loves her sister, Elle, and would love to be adopted with her.  The girls are already fairly good about using pee pads and a potty patch with ASTRO turf\n\nVee will make a wonderful addition to any family with children over ten years of age.\n \nPlease complete and return the adoption application to meet Vee, or any of our adoptable dogs.\nhttp://www.route66rescueinc.com/adoption-application.html Thank you for visiting our site. Please come back often.",

            "description": "Moony is a ridiculous, lovey boy. He had a rough start and never learned social skills. He is submissive to humans and eager to please.\n\nHe LOVES tennis balls and tough squeaky toys. His favorite toy is his squeaky Kong bunny. He needs lots of play, exercise and affection. Needs room in the yard to run. He gives the best kisses. (His teeth get brushed daily!) Moon is a ridiculous goofball who doesn't know his own size. He likes to sit in your lap and he enjoys feeling small and protected. \n\nHe likes sticking his head out the window on car rides and getting whipped cream treats from Starbucks. Known commands: sit, heel, catch, down, lay down, wait, up, come, and free. He comes if you whistle. He understands \"stay and \"place but doesn't always do it. He loves playing fetch with tennis balls and rope toys. He gives endless kisses! He hides under the bed when it rains or if he's scared. He is crate trained but gets depressed if he has to stay in the crate a lot. He needs a lot of human presence and love. In return, he will love you with all of his big, goofy heart. He will let you flop him onto his back and play with his paws, and he gets this relaxed, goofy grin. He seems to always do better if he has a strong male presence around; a male \"pack leader seems to make him feel more secure. He's very sensitive to his owner's moods and becomes fearful/hides if his owner is upset or crying. \n\nMoon does not do well with other animals and needs to be the only pet in the household. Moon is available for adoption in Texas ONLY.\n\nAs a small organization, we cannot answer emails about each of our pets. Please fill out an application for more information on this dog, and one of our adoption coordinators will contact you.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.LUCIA IS CURRENTLY BEING FOSTERED IN ILLINOIS\n\nLucia is a 3 1/2 year old, Blue, 130 pound female Neapolitan Mastiff. She is being fostered in Missouri. An individual rescued her and her sister Lilla from a dog auction, and then immediately surrendered them to Mastino Rescue. Very little is known about their previous life.. We speculate that they were used to living in a wide open space in their previous lives before rescue because many things in life are very new and frightening to them. She is a little cautious/shy/scared of new things but will build more confidence every day with love and security. She takes just a moment to warm up to new people. Once she does, she wants nothing but for you to be her person. Lucia will have to learn how to walk on a leash, be potty trained and learn how to be a dog. We do not know how she will do with other dogs/cats at this time. She will be spayed, UTD on shots, HW tested and parasite-free. If you are interested in adopting Lucia, please go to our website at www.mastinorescue.org and complete a Family Profile. Please remember you must own your home, no children under the age of 10 and have a 6 foot privacy fence due to our insurance requirements. STAY TUNED FOR MORE UPDATES TO FOLLOW.",

The adopter is the alpha member of the pack, and the dog or puppy needs as much one-on-one contact with the alpha as possible. For this reason, all Route 66 Rescue Inc. dogs are adopted to inside homes only. They must be on leash, or inside a secure fence when outside, and not left outside alone when no one is home. Invisible fencing does not qualify as protection since other animals and strangers have access to the dog. The dogs must be returned to Route 66 Rescue, Inc. if ever given up by the adopter. Thank you for understanding we want only the best for the dogs you give a forever home.\n\nJanet has had the first two of her puppy vaccinations.  She can only be adopted in the immediate Springfield/Ozark area.  Adopter must be able to take her for her last puppy appointment at Best Friends Animal Hospital in Ozark on \nJanuary 19.  That day, she will get her third round of DA2PPV with Corona vaccination, rabies vaccination, and be spayed.  She will need to be at Best Friends between 7:30 and 8:00 and picked up that afternoon after three.  \n \nPlease complete and return the adoption application to meet any of our adoptable dogs.\nhttp://www.route66rescueinc.com/adoption-application.html Thank you for visiting our site.

            "description": "Prince is a magnificent 1-1/2 year old male Chocolate Labrador Retriever mix who was surrendered by his owner on December 2, 2020 along with his two brothers (Damon and Rebel) because he was no longer able to give them the time and attention that they deserved.\n\nPrince has a chocolate brown short smooth coat, a large white bib on his chest which is sprinkled with brown freckles, a long tail, and an adorable face with a milk chocolate nose, a chubby muzzle, and short floppy ears. \n\nPrince has a sweet, very demure disposition and a friendly personality.  Prince was clearly 'out of his comfort zone' when HSOV Kennel Tech Madison Barnett took him outdoors for his photo session.  Prince reluctantly walked on a leash and accompanied Madison to a grassy area where he posed for one quick picture and then decided he wanted to go back indoors.  So most of Prince's photos were taken as he begged to get back into the shelter.   This was a 'first' for us since most often the dogs are reluctant to go back inside to the kennels after their photo sessions.  \n\nWe look forward to taking more flattering pictures of this beautiful boy but wanted to share the ones we were able to capture so that potential adopters would know that Prince is in our shelter and is looking for a fabulous home.\n\nPrince weighs 53 lbs. He doesn't appear to have had much walking-on-a-leash experience, but he is a clever young man who will quickly master that new skill with help from our kennel techs.\n\nPrince will be neutered before being adopted by his new family.\n\nUPDATE: Prince was neutered on January 18, 2021 and was also given rabies vaccine. \n\n",

I'm definitely a house dog and I'm very affectionate. I'm not a fan of livestock or delivery trucks and I think I'm allergic to cats!  I'm a very strong dog and a good protector but I like it when there is someone to hold and snuggle me the first and last thing everyday!  Someone that will look past my faults and love me for who I am. Someone that I can call mine. If you like tall, dark and handsome, I could be your man.\n\nNote:  Great Pyrenees are considered a Giant Breed.  Average weight can be 100lbs. or more.  They bark, shed and have a wanderlust, so secure fences are a must have.  They are NOT off leash dogs and a Pyr off leash is called a \"dis'a'Pyr\".  Some Pyrs do well with other dogs and some don't because by the virtue of their breed traits they were bred to keep out intruders and can consider some dogs as intruders. While they make wonderful pets and family dogs, they aren't for everyone so be sure to understand and learn about the breed traits of this breed or any breed you might be considering.",

You see, I was found wandering on my own and taken in to stay at this nice shelter.  That was my lucky day because they are very good to me here.  I love my caretakers (I know they love me, too), but I\u2019ve been waiting SO LONG for a real home of my own where I can hang my leash forever. \n\nWhat would you like to know about me?  As you can see in my pictures, I\u2019m a pitty\u2026.they tell me I\u2019m very handsome.   I am a big boy, weighing in at 75 \u2013 80 pounds.  I\u2019m  8 years old and my human friends at the shelter say that I am super sweet.  They know I can't stay here forever and really want to help me find my forever home.  I have learned lots of good manners since I came here.  I  sit nicely for treats and wait while I\u2019m getting harnessed for my walks.  I'm still a work in progress, but I try really hard to please.  \n\nI\u2019m house trained and (of course), kennel trained.  I also walk well on a leash, but sometimes new situations can get me worked up which makes me jump and bite at my leash.  I\u2019m working hard to overcome that \u2013 and I know I'll keep improving with a confident leader.  When it comes to other dogs, I like them just fine.  I have to admit that my greeting skills need a little polish because I get a bit excited  to say hello when new ones come to the shelter.\n\nHere are some things that I\u2019m hoping for in my new family:  Most important is a patient, calm home where my people will be willing to give me time to figure out what\u2019s expected of me.  They should be experienced with my breed \u2013 or large dogs.  I would never intentionally harm anyone but, since I\u2019m a strong energetic boy, my home should be with adults or teens.  I wouldn't want to accidently knock over a young child if I get a little jumpy.  A fenced yard where I can run around and play would be nice, but not required because I mostly just want to be wherever my people are.\n\nI am neutered and up to date with vaccines.  I\u2019m also heart worm negative and on monthly preventative.  If you are a pitty lover, I hope you will open your heart and home to help me become the best dog I can be.  I promise to be your devoted companion.  I\u2019m not perfect, but if you think I may be perfect for you, please email Chris at rescue3@earthlink.net and she\u2019ll contact you. She can arrange a meet and greet in CT.  Can\u2019t wait to meet you!! \n\nTHIS IS A COURTESY LISTING  \n",

He\u2019s a goofy boy that just wants someone to love him the way he deserves.

But don\u2019t let his size fool you, he is really very sweet.  He\u2019s big mush who loves his people. He is dog selective, so we suggest he be the dog only in the home.  Cats are unknown.  Due to his size, we recommend no young children.  He prefers a yard so he can run and play.  He loves his down time too and will make a great tv buddy or book reading pal.  He loves walks but is fine just playing in his own yard as well.  Spencer is neutered; fully vetted.\n \nIf you are interested in being Spencer\u2019s forever home and best buddy, please contact adoptions@paws-li.org or go to our FB page or call the number listed below.\n \nPioneers for Animals Welfare Society, Inc.\nhttp://www.paws-li.org\nPhone: (631) 306-4616",

She is also deaf.\n\nFrida recently went out on an outting with one of our wonderful volunteers and he is what she had to say, \"Frida was VERY happy to get out for an adventure with me today and I must say she is AMAZING company! I had to remind myself she cannot hear.  She gets around so well but jumps if she is touched from behind.  Fast movement also makes her a bit nervous but she recovers very quickly with gentle affection and calm reassurance.  She knows sit (sign language) and I'm pretty sure she can read lips.  She is VERY into eye contact!\n \nWe grabbed some vittles at Wimpies in Soddy Daisy then went across the street to eat at a table near Poe's Tavern.  I planned to share my ice water with Frida and put half in a bowl for her but she submerged her entire snout into my cup before I could protest. \n \nWhile I ate my lunch, Frida practiced her SIT and was rewarded with some bites of Wimpies cornbread.  I tried to get some pretty posed pics in front of the Tavern but Frida COULD NOT stop rolling and wiggling around in the grass.  Frida is a fun loving girl.\n \nWe took a short walk in the park.  Frida saw others but never barked.  In fact, she didn't bark one time while we were out and about (but I am told she does bark some in her kennel). Frida loved chillin' on the dock in the sun and watching the birds.\n \nFrida is such a good girl.  Due to the fact she is deaf, she probably should not be in a home with small children.  She is SO affectionate and calm.  She will thrive in a home where she gets lots of attention and love.  It would be really good for Frida if she has an adopter who is committed to teaching her how to communicate through sign language.  Frida wants to be a good girl and is very anxious to learn.\"\n \n\n\nWe're open Wednesday - Sunday 12 - 5 p.m but are doing meet & greets and adoptions by appointment only.  \n\nThe adoption fee is $90 which includes a free veterinary exam within 2 weeks of adoption at local participating vets, up to date vaccinations, heartworm test,  heartworm preventative, dewormer, flea preventative, microchip, & spay or neuter.\n\nIf you are interested in this pet, please fill out our ADOPTION APPLICATION at https://goo.gl/forms/9FdDBiPU5aa5ySTv1\n\nVisit our website at www.PetPlacementCenter.com",

            "description": "Cowboy was recently rescued as a found dog.  He had been surviving in sub-freezing temperatures with no shelter or food.  At the time he was rescued, this beautiful heeler was very scared and skittish (but it was obvious he wanted help).  This is normal behavior for a dog in deep survival mode.\n\nCowboy is a great dog in the process of learning to trust.  He is friendly, but unsure of what to expect in a shelter environment.  We think he will open up more quickly just as soon as he can get homed with someone who understands the needs of the breed (and specifically the needs of this guy who has obviously survived some very difficult circumstances).\n\nSomeone is going to get a fabulous dog when they adopt this guy.  He has such great potential.  You can see it in his eyes.  \n\nIf you are the right one to build up Cowboy's confidence, and if you can help him learn to trust in the goodness of human beings, please email us for a pre-adoption questionnaire.  woof@slvaws.org\n\nOnce you are approved for adoption, you may set up an appointment to come meet Cowboy at our shelter near San Luis, CO.  We practice safe COVID-19 protocols.\n\n",

He bit his senior owner, but we know why....he is completely deaf as some rough coat russels can be. She startled him from a sound sleep and scared him. :'( The prior owner didn't know he was deaf. Knowing this, he needs a special home that understands not to startle a deaf pup! He is not aggressive here with anyone, but we know to get the attention of dogs that can't hear us coming. He is housetrained and loves walks and running around. He may be 12 years old...but no one told him! P.S. I have a 20 year old JRT personally so they can live very long lives when well loved!",

She has not been offered for adoption prior to this time, but we feel she would enjoy being an only dog in a home that can meet her needs and decided we would see if that special someone is out there.  Jordyn is well trained,  well behaved, and extremely affectionate but quite timid and reserved and it will take her time to warm up to a new person.  The following are the requirements for her new home:\n\nAdult female home - Jordyn is frightened of children and men\nFenced yard.\nA human who will be available to her often during the day - someone who works from home would be ideal\nNo other animals.  Jordyn does not do well with other dogs and might well chase cats.\nRural home - loud noises and heavy traffic are very difficult for her.\nNot a livestock guardian dog - indoor pet home only\n\nAn understanding of the temperament of the guardian breeds will be a big plus!\n\nJordyn is healthy, spayed, current on vaccines and heartworm preventative.  Her adoption fee is $250.  For an online adoption application, please email reverence@ottcmail.com.  A telephone conversation will take place AFTER an approved application is received.  A meet/greet, veterinary references, and a home visit are also requirements for our adoptions.  Potential applicants should reside within a 50 mile radius of Ithaca, New York or in the Rochester area.",

            "description": "Chandler and Joey were rescued from a shelter. Both were sad and timid at the shelter. They have been neglected unhealthy and have severe flea dermatitis. Once out of the shelter he was very happy friendly and sweet. Good with other dogs. He needs healthy food basic home training and TLC. Chandler and Joey are already separated into two different foster homes.\nUpdate from Foster Home: Chandler truly is a lovely and sweet boy. He's not a big fan of loud noises or fast motions so I have been slowly introducing him to new experiences at his level. We have given him an area in the house where he can just relax process his new reality and feel safe. He is a little shy when meeting new people but will definitely warm up over time. Fortunately he has a very big appetite and is very treat motivated! I'm happy to report that he does not show any signs of food aggression. He also loves other dogs and loves to be in their company! He just wants to receive and give love so much but is wary possibly due to little human interaction in his past. Needs dog experienced adults. Chandler will surely share his affectionate personality with an appropriate family that understands his yearning to be loved. House-training is in progress. Need home with attached yard.\nOn 8/31/20 3rd vet exam and neuter the vet told us that he has 4 front lower teeth worn down (common with neglect case and from being locked in a kennel & chewing cage). 3 Vets confirmed they did not need extraction. Prior vets and shelter vet did not inform us of need to remove any teeth. Only noted tartar at shelter. His skin is now healed from the flea dermatitis. Looking great. Loves food and eating well.\nVet confirmed at time of neuter exam no dental extraction needed for worn lower bottom teeth.\nChandler is very bonded to his foster home with women and men. Also great with neighbors older kids and other dogs that may visit out front. However he will need time to adjust emotionally to new potential adopters since he wants to follow his foster home. He would love a dog friend at home that is polite and not try to challenge him.\nUpdate: Chandler was adopted but returned within the month due to sudden fear issues and nipped their adult daughter. We are unsure why he has these random fear issues when he seemed so happy go lucky before. He needs a very quiet routine and experienced adult home with yard to work thru his fear issues.\nUpdate 1/11/21: Chandler is crate trained. He generally gets along fine with cats and has learned to ignore his feline companions. I have taught him how to sit down shake hand spin roll over and working on soldiering (low body crawl)!!! He's intelligent and bonds through training!! Chandler is taking fluoxetine daily and trazodone on an as-needed basis. So far the medication seems to be helping calm his nervousness. He no longer looks around endlessly or in fear of noises in his surroundings.",

            "description": "Noelle (watch my video at the shelter and me at my foster home!) was neglected and thin when she was abandoned at a dog park. Shelter took her in and started her vet care. She had fly bites on her ear was thin had flea dermatitis needed dental (worn bottom teeth) and overall unhealthy.\nAfter a month at the shelter her time was up. She had no options left and was getting kennel stressed. Thanks to our foster home we were able to rescue her. Noelle is people friendly and loves attention. With dogs at the shelter play-yard she needed to meet first and then fine hanging out.\nShe does listen to corrections. When finally out of the shelter she did do excitement barking at dogs at a distance. We have to see if she was barking because she was excited to be out finally (after a month) or reactive to dog park. GSD do like to talk. Noelle did fine on walk and already knows 'sit' and 'down' for treats. She loves to play ball and will bring it back & drop it.\nNoelle is now relaxing at her foster home after her spay and dental/extractions. She needs time to relax learn and get healthier. Noelle is beautiful and smart. She will need an experienced GSD guardian. Adult-only and home with yard. More info. to come from her Foster Home.YouTube: https://youtu.be/zKA79Jy3Cxk",

I'm still a young guy and am working hard on my leash and house manners. I have lots of energy and sometimes that makes me overly excited when I see new people and other dogs, so I need your help with correcting that behavior I am especially reactive to dogs when I'm out on my leash and I see them. But, when I've been able to play with other dogs, we get along great. I would like to have enough room (maybe a fenced yard) to run and play and even invite some dog friends over to run off energy and socialize. I am crate trained and potty trained so no worries about that. I'm really a good guy--I just need some structure and training so hone my best behavior. I hope you will come meet me. We could have so much fun together. Love, Julius",

She is mostly potty trained - with a regular routine and no long periods at home she has no accidents, and she is crate trained and enjoys sleeping there (she knows the word \"bedtime\"!)\n\nGerdy will need a home willing to be understanding of her history and go slow in the beginning. She definitely has a big personality in her little body and over time you'll get to see that she's a diligent Squirrel Patrol Agent, has lots of opinions on dinner time, and loves to be scratched behind the ears.\n\nGerdy is spayed, up to date on all vaccinations, and microchipped.",

            "description": "Mr. Opie is 7 years old.  He apparently has been tossed around a lot in the past few months.  He was with an original owner for several years who could no longer keep him.  He got given away and the person who got him  only kept him for two days.  Then that person gave him to another person who let him run free and he got picked up by a police department.  They had him for a very short time and then were seen dumping him out of a truck.  As you can see it has been a while for this guy to get any real love.\n\nWe have done his vetting and he is now ready to go home.  He is neutered, current on his shots, wormed, heartworm negative and micro-chipped.  He just needs a committed owner who doesn't dump him or get rid of him.\n\nHe loves people - would recommend no children under 12..  He doesn't seem to have ever met a stranger.  We were told he is a \"handful\" - but most dogs are.  Our guess would be with a little love and attention he will settle in to be a great dog.  His original owner says he is a Mountain Cur.  He is NOT good with cats (or any small creature).\n\nHis adoption fee is $125.00.  In order to meet him or visit the shelter you have to submit an application and have that tentatively approved.  You will find the application on our website at www.patriotsforpets.com under the 'Adoption\\ tab.",

            "description": "Have you met Tessa?\n\nTessa was originally surrendered to the San Diego Humane Society-Escondido in August 2020, because her family moved and did not include her in their plans to take her along. Then she was adopted from Frosted Faces, and now she is back, due to no fault of her own. She is 9 years old, weighs 12 lbs., and needs a forever family!\n\nTessa went on a two week Frosted Fling over the holidays, and we learned so much about what she's like in a home environment. Here's what we know:\n\nTessa loves mealtime! There were six other dogs in her Fling home, and she was not food aggressive with the other dogs eating around her and did not attempt to go to other bowls once the other dogs were eating. According to her Fling Mom, Tessa integrated well with the rest of the pack. She occasionally became snippy if she was laying with her Fling Mom, and another dog jumped up next to them, but once everyone was laying down, Tessa was fine with sharing her and the space around her.\n\nTessa does have energy, and despite having a cast for broken toes during the first half of her Fling, she got around with no problem. She became even more agile when the cast came off, but her activity needed to be limited and didn't include walks, which she enjoys. Tessa played with toys a few times during her Fling and also chased her Fling sibling around the yard. Now that she's no longer restricted from activity, we can see Tessa being ready for all kinds of fun with her forever family!\n\nTessa knows to go potty outside and only had a few accidents in the house, before catching on to using the puppy pad if she needed to. Her Fling Mom learned it was best for Tessa to go outside immediately after eating.\n\nTessa is a very friendly girl and approached everyone who visited her Fling home hoping to be petted. Tessa was very calm around her Fling Mom's small grandsons. Even with their running around, she was completely at ease. As Tessa became more comfortable in her Fling home, she started sleeping with her Fling Mom at night, snuggled up against her.\n\nShe is a sweet girl who asks for very little other than to be loved.\n\nTessa is now living in a Foster home while she waits for her Forever Family. Might that be you?\n\nApply to meet her:\nwww.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nVisit during Open House: Saturdays & Sundays, 10 am - 1 pm\n\nLearn more about our programs at: www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family. No adoption fees and we help with medical costs!\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\nUpdated 1/24/21 KG",

I love to give kisses and cuddle and will follow you around wherever you go.\n\nI love my toys, especially my peanut butter bones. I love to run around and play with other dogs. I would do well with another dog in my home as its lonely being by yourself. I am dog friendly and I especially like more submissive dogs. Proper introductions would be required of course.\n\nSince I like having people and other dogs around, I would do well in a home where my humans are home a lot. After all, who wants to leave a handsome guy like me?\n\nYou must be over 21 and a home owner to adopt me. Please visit www.pittiesandpurrs.org to fill out an application.

Under all that beefcake, Mack is a loving sweet dog with a gentle disposition.  He is a friend to all and a wonderful family companion.  Mack is great with children and fun to be around.  He enjoys morning walks to see what the neighbors are up to, followed by a good hearty breakfast.  After that, it\u2019s playtime with the kiddos chasing balls or tugging on a toy.  He loves to learn new tricks and is quite bright.  Especially if you throw him a treat!  Mack also is good with other dogs and makes friends easily.  He\u2019s a rough and tumble player with his pals.  A fenced in yard will give him a safe place to run and play.  After a good workout, he likes to unwind with a favorite chew toy.  He calms down quickly and is well mannered in the home.  He is already housebroken, so you can skip the dreaded potty training.  He sleeps well in his own bed but wouldn\u2019t mind being your sleep buddy.  He won\u2019t hog the bed and promises not to snore.  Mack is a pretty chill dude and a fun family dog to have around.  \n\nTo adopt this pet, Click \"More About Us\" and then \"Adoption Application\" to be directed to our online HSNWGA application form.

Stretch was bought as a puppy and just left outside. He was surrendered to a local shelter where he tested positive for Lyme disease. We were asked to help. Of course we couldn\u2019t say no! Stretch finished out his treatment for Lyme disease in a warm, cozy foster home! We found out that Stretch is visually impaired, but that doesn\u2019t stop him from finding his way around! His foster home has stairs and he has mastered them! He knows exactly where the fence line is in the yard, and often enjoys sniffing up and down the fence. Stretch didn\u2019t even know what a toy or treat was when he got to his foster home. Now, he enjoys playing with toys and definitely loves treats!! Stretch is in a foster home with kiddos, cats and dogs. He LOVES new people! Stretch really enjoys snuggling up on the couch with his humans. He is a very laid back boy! \nAdoption fee is $200 and includes his neuter, microchip with registration, UTD on shots and current on heartworm, flea and tick prevention.

He's neutered now, so will never be bred again. He's doing great in his foster home. The 1st night he marked two things, but after a stern \"NO\", he hasn't marked anything else. He needs a home with no cats and a 6ft fence. He is starting to try to play with the other dogs in his foster home too. He does sleep through the night in his kennel, but he would love to share your bed with you. He is definitely a lap dog, and he gives hugs too. Watch for him to have his treatment completed, so he can be available for you to adopt!\n\nPlease visit www.handsheartspaws.org for an adoption application\n\nAll of our dogs are current on vaccinations, spayed/neutered, microchipped, fecal tested, heartworm tested, and they are all on heartworm and flea/tick preventative.\n\nThe adoption process is an application, a vet reference, a home visit, and a lifetime contract. The requested adoption donation for this dog is $350__.\n\nWe do not REQUIRE a fenced in yard (some dogs DO REQUIRE a fence.  Decide what is best for each dog), we do REQUIRE a means of safe outside containment.  We do NOT adopt to homes that use invisible fencing.  Invisible fencing is NOT a safe means of outside containment.\n\nWe are willing to adopt out-of-state, contingent on our ability to complete a home visit, but you must travel to Omaha to complete the adoption. We do not transport or ship our dogs.",

I'm housebroken, love walks, get along with other dogs. I choose to ignore cats, like to spend my days cuddling on sofa with Foster Mom. When I meet strangers or see them on walks I bark at them but after a minute or if you tell me no I stop. I love to go to the dog park and run. I'm a happy girl have lots of love to give and hope to find someone who would like to give me lots of love back. I am very attracted to my Foster Mom so my new family is gonna have to understand this and help me through the very difficult separation from her. I may cry and whine the first few days and nights. If you have the extra love and patience for me please submit an adoption application.\nI'm 7-8 years old and I don't bark in house unless a knock on door or see someone outside\nLily's former owner said she has seizures. Her current Foster Mom did see 1 short seizure beginning of June 2020 and bloodwork was done but was normal. No more seizures since. www.dashanimalrescue.org Dashrescue00@gmail.com",

He was extremely well taken care of and loved and they did what was best for him.\n?\nTucker\u00a0does need to be the only pet (no dogs or cats), but is great\u00a0with\u00a0people. He\u00a0lived\u00a0with\u00a0a 3 year old toddler in his previous home and did well!\u00a0Tucker is a goofball and typical bully! He knows some basic obedience commands and is very affectionate.\n?\nTucker is\u00a0fully vetted\u00a0including neuter, vaccines, deworm, 4dx heartworm test, bloodwork panel,\u00a0microchip, on monthly heartworm prevention, and on monthly flea/tick prevention.\n?\nNote: All of our dogs remain in foster care for a minimum of 30 days before eligible to go to their forever home. This gives them time to settle and time for us to learn more about them to better pair them with an adoptive home. We DO accept apps during this time! Tucker's 30 days end on 1/13/21.\n\nFor an adoption application, visit our website at bellareedpbr.com/adoption. \n\nFor more photos of Tucker, visit his photo album on our Facebook page at Facebook.com/BRPBR.",

            "description": "If you are looking for a super handsome, personable young pup\u2026look no further! Max is here!\n\nMax is a very energetic boy, believed to be a Lab-Great Dane Mix, possibly a bit of Pitbull too!\nHe\u2019s about a year old, and typical of Labs or Pitbulls of this age, he\u2019s full of energy and can be a challenge to those trying to train him. It\u2019s not his fault though.\n\nMax found himself at Chicago Animal Control when his family no longer wanted him. It is very obvious they never spent any time with him, and certainly never put any effort into training him with even the most basic of commands. So, he arrived at our Safe House, somewhat of a \u201cwild child!\u201d  The good news is however, that Max is eager to please, and is a quick learner. He just needs someone to pay attention to him, work with him, and help him evolve into a perfect family member!\n\nThe ideal family for Max is one with extensive dog experience with high-energy dogs, a fenced yard for Max to run and play, possibly a canine companion  of comparable size, and most importantly the time and commitment to Max\u2019s care and training. Due to his current lack of manners and bubbly personality, Max should not be placed in a home with children under the age of 12. He is not at all aggressive but is strong and relatively large (65 or so lbs) and could easily knock over a small person.  Obedience training is required to ensure Max will develop into a well-behaved canine companion.\n\nMax is fully vetted, neutered, microchipped, heartworm negative and on year-round heartworm preventative.\n\nIf you are interested in adding this handsome personable pup to your family, and meet the requirements noted, feel free to contact BAARKDogRescue@gmail.com or 847-852-0895.\n",

            "description": "Attention Rottweiler lovers! 3 year old Dieter is looking for a special owner. He requires an experienced Rottweiler owner willing to take on a challenge. Dieter came to us as a stray who was on his own for a while. He has resource guarding and has a bite record.  Dieter must be in an environment with no children, cats or other small animals. He is selective about which dogs he gets along with.  A fenced in yard is preferred and we are accepting applications from home owners only. \nDue to Dieter\u2019s special needs his Adoption includes a training course to be determined.  Attending this training will be a mandatory condition of adoption. \nDespite his challenges Dieter can be a playful and lovable boy. If you think you can provide Dieter with the environment he requires to keep him and others safe please fill out an application on our website. If you think you can give Dieter the life he deserves, please fill out an application at https://www.lakeshorehumanesociety.org/online-adoption-form",

            "description": "Currently in foster in Puyallup, Washington. Lobo was a drop-off out in the country. Heaven only knows why. He is a Lab mix (about 60#s) and very friendly and a bit rambunctious. Judging an energy level from 1-10 (1 is the old Hound Dog; 10 is the Jack Russell that is like the Energy Bunny)... he is about a 7-8. I believe with exercise and training, he will settle down... most of the time. He has not had any training but he's very happy. We think he is about 4 yrs old. He was very skinny but is doing fabulous. He is a higher energy dog and you would think he was 1 not about four! lol\n\n \n\nChildren: Lobo is great with children but because of his high energy level, I wouldn't have him around young children. They need to be at least 12 or older. He will be a good partner for hiking, swimming, bicycling ...(you, not him), etc.\n\n \n\nCats: He does chase cats. Must be in a cat-less house or at least keep them totally separate.\n\nHeartworm Tested: He is HEART WORM NEG.\n\n \n\nHouse Training: We believe he has been an outside dog most of his life. Along with the behavior training, potty training should be easy because he's never known he could do his business in the house. It's just a matter of bonding and communicating.\n\n \n\nAdoptions include neuter/spay, vaccinations (DHPP, Bordetella, Rabies), microchip, transport with one of our professional dog transporters, and 6 mos of heartworm prevention..\n\n \n\nIf you have any questions, text me... 210-394-6060.\n\n \n\nLobo is available for pre-adoption. If you are interested in adopting, please fill out the on-line application. COPY and PASTE the application link .\n\nhttp://shaynesrescue.com/adoption-application-pet-central-satx/\n\n \n\nYou can also go to our Facebook page...\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Pet-Central-SATX-866684826744181/\n\nand LIKE us to help us out.\n\n \n\nGET IN LINE FIRST: If you are interested in this dog, please fill out the application (link listed above). The rescue will contact you once the application is received. Although we strive to answer everyone, due to the high volume of inquiries we receive, we cannot guarantee a response to all emails. Filling out the application is the ONLY way to ensure a response from the rescue. In addition, while you are emailing us, if others apply, you lose out adopting the dog you chose. We have hundreds of puppies/dogs available so there really is no need to apply anywhere else. Also, one application is good even if you are interested in several different dogs...one application no matter which one you choose. We try to make it as easy as possible for you but if you are applying or have applied anywhere else, we do need to know that, too.\n\n \n\nSHANYE'S FOSTERS is a group of foster parents in the Olympia/Tumwater area. We foster dogs for rescues and assist them in adopting/rehoming of their pups/dogs by listing on this site. Many dogs posted here are available to pre adopt NOW directly from the rescue. The only ones in foster in the NW specifically state that. We have very few fosters so most need to be pre adopted. All adoption fees go towards rescuing more dogs in need. No one receives a salary. Shayne's Fosters is not responsible for any experience you have with any dog you might see posted on this site. They are the property of the sponsoring rescue who will supply all medical supporting records which is given with each dog when adopted.\n\n \n\nOur adoption fees cover all medical costs to make sure the pups are appropriately vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, and spayed/ neutered. It also covers the cost of transport from Texas and the necessary health certificate documentation. The fees also include a negative heartworm test for any dogs over 6 months. Some dogs have additional medical, such as FHO, ACL, hernias, dental, and a myriad of other vetting. We do full disclosure of medical care/situations. If the adoption fees seem high (which never cover the true cost of rescue), we recommend fostering for a good rescue. Fostering ensures you incur no vet bills and no boarding fees. We are always in need of good fosters. We are all volunteers who donate our time and resources to help save as many dogs/pups lives as we possibly can.\n\n \n\nThank you for choosing to adopt a rescue pup/dog. Over 1 billion dogs worldwide are put to sleep (PTS) annually... thousands daily. The dog pounds PTS entire litters, pregnant/nursing moms and wonderful dogs that can make someone a great companion. We firmly believe there is NO breed other than \"rescue\" for all species. Thank you for being part of the village it takes to save these precious lives.",

Mama can be very shy and timid with strangers but she warms up fast with the help of treats. She is a very easy going dog and likes to sleep for the most part of the day but will follow you everywhere to get some pets. Mama is great on a leash, she never pulls and follows your lead. She is great with cats and dogs, and shows little to no interest in them, preferring to keep to herself. She has been staying with a foster family for a couple of weeks and she is potty trained. Mama has experienced small and short head seizures a couple of times in the past. They are not frequent enough to require medicine but possible adopters need to be aware of them.  We would like to find a gentle and loving family who will welcome this sweet girl into their lives. If you\u2019d like to meet Mama or receive more information please text Lorena at 312-371-0284 or email bornfreepetshelter@gmail.com",

A little patience and understanding will go a long way with him. He must have, though, had some negative experiences with children, as he is not comfortable with them and therefore is looking for an adult only family. Currently he would be best suited as an only dog until he has had time to adjust to a new home and feels relaxed and loved and bonded, so he is more open to other dogs. Rusty is such a super cute and smart fellow, he would make the perfect addition to commited adopter family that shows him that their world can be a fun place with him in it.",

I love all the people and even give kisses to prove it! My foster mom calls me a chonker and tells me I'm down with the thickness. I don't know what she means but we're working on it. My happy place is in my big, soft, fluffy dog bed! You know what they say, the one who snores will fall asleep first and I'm a gold medalist. If you have any doggie friends at home, I'd love to meet them! I'm a pretty chill gal, but I still love to play! My squeaky tennis ball is my most favorite toy, and I really like when my foster mom zoomies around the house with me.\n\nI've never been one for the fast life though, I enjoy my walks nice and slow so I can take in the view and smell the roses. I take treats very gentle and have the cutest toots a girl could have. I let you know when I need to use the ladies room, or when I'm out of water and I always do it with a big smile on my face. So, what do ya say? Wanna chill, hang out, watch movie, play tag and maybe even just catch some Z's? \n\nLove is in the air, and it smells like COFFEE.\n\nI am currently in a foster home.

One of my favorite things to do issoak up the sunshine. I'd do best in a home without cats and a home with children 8years old and up.\n\nGeneral Socialization Notes:\n\n I am shy, at first, when meeting new people, but I will warm up. I am mostly potty trained, but I am still working on it a bit. I'm also working on crate training. I protest a bit when I'm crated. I'm very food motivated, so learning is fun for me. I live with small dogs in my foster homeand do well with all of them.\n\nDoes Tequila like other pets?\n\nI love playing with other dogs. I've been fostered with dogs under 30 lbs. I do like to chase cats, so a home without cats would be best.\n\nDoes Tequila like children?\n\n A home with children 8years old and up would be best.\n\nFavorite Toys:\n\nI love toys!I also like Kongs and chews like Bully Sticks and Cow Hooves.\n\nIdeal Forever Home:\n\n I'd love a family who understands that I will need time to warm up to new people. I want my family to love to spend time with me because I do love to spend time with my humans once I warm up.I'd be okay in an apartment, as long as I get enough exercise.

He also enjoys watching TV with you.\nSkoshie is a lover boy and wants to be close to you. \nHe will share your bed but does not mind staying in a crate when you leave the house. \nHe is a handsome well behaved pooch. I should have called him Fabio.\n    Adoption fee $400\n\nAll UnderDogs are spayed/neutered, heartworm checked, microchipped, up to date on vaccines and heartworm/flea/tick preventatives.  For consideration for one or more dogs, we require that an on-line application is filled out.  \n\nTO ADOPT THIS DOG PLEASE FILL OUT AN APPLICATION AT https://underdogrescueofflorida.com/. \n\nSorry, we do not adopt outside of Florida.  Applicants are subject to a home visit, and veterinary references will be checked. Please include a vet reference (including phone number) when applying online.\n\nOur application process:\nFIRST, an application must be approved for adoption from our rescue.\nSECOND, we determine whether the dog that has been applied for is a \"good match\" for the household that wants to adopt him/her.  We take into consideration the dog's activity level, compatibility with other members of the household (human and other pets), etc.\nIf your application has been approved, but the dog you applied for is no longer available, please take the time and look over our adoptable dogs again.  We will make every effort to find the right dog for an approved applicant.\n\nWe hope you agree and understand that our goal to find the best forever home is our #1 priority!

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.LILLA IS CURRENTLY BEING FOSTERED IN ILLINOIS\n\nLilla is a 3 1/2 old, Blue, 130 pound female Neapolitan Mastiff. She is being fostered in Missouri. An individual rescued her from a dog auction, and then immediately surrendered her to Mastino Rescue. Very little is known about her previous life. We speculate that she was used to living in a wide open space in her life previous to rescue because many things are very new and frightening to her. She is a little cautious/shy/scared of new things but will build confidence every day with love and security. She takes a moment to warm up to new people. Once she does, she wants nothing but for you to be her person. Lilla will have to learn how to walk on a leash, be potty trained and how to be a dog. We do not know how she will do with other dogs/cats at this time. She will be spayed, UTD on shots, HW tested and parasite-free. If you are interested in adopting Lilla, please go to our website at www.mastinorescue.org and complete a Family Profile. Please remember you must own your home, no children under the age of 10 and have a 6 foot privacy fence due to our insurance requirements. Transport can be arranged. Mastino Rescue also has her sister Lucia, who is looking for her forever home. STAY TUNED FOR MORE UPDATES TO FOLLOW.",

My life was not always great, my owners were about to move off and leave me behind when the nice rescue lady took me in. I never knew what shelter was other than under a mobile home. The nice rescue people gave me a real home and showed me what love was. I had ear infections so bad my ears were swollen shut. They fixed all of that and let the nice vet man fix me all up, get me current on vaccinations and spay me. They said I was heartworm negative and the rescue people were so glad and put me on preventative to keep me that way. I am a very sweet girl that is shy at first but loves to snuggle. I love to play with the other foster furkids and have learned how to walk on leash. My foster mommy tells me I am a very smart gal because I learned the doggie door like a pro and the crate training thing was a breeze. Can you give a great gal like me a furever home to call my own? I promise lots of snuggles and unconditional love abounding.",

He knows \"sit\" and \"shake,\" and he'd be happy to demonstrate when you come meet him. Oscar came into the shelter on Nov. 28 as a lost dog and his family has not found him. He is about 3 years old and weighs 71 pounds. He is up-to-date on vaccinations, now neutered, heartworm tested negative and will be microchipped upon adoption. Come meet him in Run 76, using ID#626227.\n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information. Shelter hours are: Tues. - Sun. 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. by appointment only until further notice, CLOSED Mondays & Holidays.",

We are bonded and it would be best for both of us if we could be adopted together. I am a sweet girl but very vocal and sometimes you might mistake those sounds as me being angry but I'm really not. I like to play with other dogs, but I can be selective with who I choose to engage with. As a Husky, I most likely have a high prey drive and would probably prefer not to be in a home with cats or other small animals. I would ABSOLUTELY LOVE if I could find an experienced Husky owner who is aware of our high energy levels, large size, and high-maintenance grooming needs (I need to be brushed daily!) I would love a great big yard for me to run around in and I think I'd be happiest living a rather quiet lifestyle with my new family. I can be a bit protective of my territory so it's best to go slow with me and let me warm up to you. I am most protective of my food and will become quiet vocal during mealtimes which may sound mean, but again, I am really a true sweetheart! I do require additional training, again I am VERY vocal, but I do appear to be potty trained and love to go for long leashed walks.",

We do require that all of your current dogs and cats are current on vaccines and spayed/neutered.  We do not have a shelter, and are a foster-home based organization.  Other than meeting our babies at events, we do require that you have an approved adoption application to schedule a meet and greet.

She is being fostered in Missouri (transport possible). An individual rescued her from a dog auction, and then immediately surrendered her to Mastino Rescue. Very little is known about her previous life. We speculate that she was used to living in a wide open space in her life previous to rescue because many things in life are very new and frightening to her. She is a little cautious/shy/scared of new things but will build more confidence every day with love and security. She takes just a moment to warm up to new people. Once she does, she wants nothing but for you to be her person. Leia will have to learn how to walk on a leash, be potty trained and learn how to be a dog. We do not know how she will do with other dogs or cats at this time. She will be spayed, UTD on shots, HW tested and parasite-free. If you are interested in adopting Leia, please go to our website at www.mastinorescue.org and complete a Family Profile. Please remember you must own your home, no children under the age of 10 and have a 6 foot privacy fence due to our insurance requirements. STAY TUNED FOR MORE UPDATES TO FOLLOW.",

I can tell you are a little afraid we will hurt you but you never show us any defense.... you just cower down when we reach out until you realize our touch is soft and you warmly lean into it. When I see you relax like that my heart melts. You have been so good for crate rest even though it stinks for a young dog. You rarely bark anymore or have an accident. I think you understand we had to save your life in more ways then one. We found you had heart worms when we rescued you and had you treated so your body needs to rest. We\u2019d love to find a real family for you to be with while you finish crate rest and then slowly get to bloom into the dog you were always meant to be.  We are looking my dear boy. I know you thought you were safe when the kind old man in Danville Arkansas took you in- it was supposed to be a life long sanctuary.... but he died. It didn\u2019t help that he had 30 of you living isolated on his property and this whole world seems so big and loud now. I know you were scared and sick but you never have to be scared again because we love you and will take care of you. We will find a warm and loving family, one with a spacious home and lots of soft places to lay. Tons of toys to toss and chew. And people who appreciate what an angel boy you are! Don\u2019t worry buddy - I will find them. They are out there looking for you and don\u2019t even know it yet. But they are waiting for you and you will complete their family. \n\nWinston deserves the nicest family for the nicest dog. He can jump fences so he can\u2019t go to a family that wants to be able to leave him play in the yard. He loves everyone. He loves toys. He\u2019s easily startled but is gaining confidence everyday. Winston needs another dog to take cues from and wilts when he is alone! So you MUST have another friendly dog to be Winstons best friend and guide!\n\nMusts:\nHave another dog\nAccept he can jump fences and not leave him alone\nPatience for a shy dog\nChildren over 10\nWants:\nCalmer household\nExperience with anxiety/nervousness\n\nWinstons fee is $800 and includes his heartworm treatment and all of our regular package of course!",

            "description": "Welcome to the Wonderful World of Rescue Dachshunds. Look around and read their bios. Find a few whose personality seems to fit well. Consider one of our Well Seasoned Seniors who are truly wonderful and have so much to offer. Need help finding the best fit? We'll help with that too. Please fill out an application and let's get you all matched up with a loving new \"furever' companion and friend. You'll find the application on the \"Available Dogs\" page.\n\nNOTE:\n\nAdoptions to Central/South Texas residents only\n\nStandard Adoption Fee Adult Dog: $250 ea. Puppy Adoption Fee: $300 ea. Reduced rates for Seniors dogs (10 and up). Reduced rates for pairs (when adopted together). All adoption fees are subject to sales tax per the State of Texas. DDRTX only adopts in Central/South Texas.\n\nEmail: ddrtxinfo@gmail.com Primary Website: www.DDRTX.org\nNutmeg Spice is about 6 years old, although she acts younger. She is a bigger dachshund mix at 20lbs. She has short red fur. She was found on the streets in San Antonio and was given all her vaccines at the S.A. ACS and is heartworm negative. She was spayed also.\n\nThe day she was taken out of the shelter and brought to her foster home, Nutmeg was very shy. It took a little while before she was comfortable.\n\nNow she is playful, loves toys!! She doesn't like sharing her toys though. She loves playing with the fosters dogs and can play for a very long time. She and the other dogs seem to like playing tag!\n\nNutmeg wants to be beside you wherever you go! She will chew her toys on top of your feet!! If you sit down, she will be on your lap and giving kisses and just loves hugs!!\n\nNutmeg would love a playmate but if she would be the only dog, she could get use to that, especially if you are there for most of the day.\n\nWhile under our care, Nutmeg started having a couple of seizures. We got her into the vet and she is now on seizure meds and she is doing great, no more seizures. She is ready for adoption. If you want a great dog to love and don't mind giving her medicine, then she could be a good dog for you!\n\nLove dachshunds and not ready to adopt or circumstances won't permit having a dog? How about being a sponsor or making a donation. Every one of our dachshunds receives excellent medical care along with day to day food, love and housing. Being non-profit, we rely on generous individuals like yourselves to help save these fur babies. You can do this specifically for one dog with the sponsor button on their webpage or a general donation on our \"How To Help\" page. Easy and quick through Pay Pal or your debit/credit card. You generosity is sincerely appreciated by all and is tax deductable. Need other ideas? You'll find tons of them on the How to Help tab. All contributions are tax deductable.\n\nDiamond Dachshund Rescue of Texas is a non-profit 501(c)(3) volunteer organization with focus on rescue and adoption of pure breed Dachshunds. All dogs are fully vetted and housed on private property. Meetings are scheduled upon adoption approval. Thank you for your continued support to the rescue and shelter communities!\nOpt to Adopt!",

She has expressive Yota-like ears and is a curious, gentle, and loving girl. A friend to all. Zella is proud of her toys - she loves toys! - and will show you her many talents. She learns new commands very quickly. She is both cute and one smart cookie!\n\nZella has a good balance of independence and a desire for human attention, with her first choice being cuddles and petting. She would love a home where she could have a dog sibling who also likes to run and play, but that is not an absolute requirement, as long as she has people to play with her. In addition to a regular, daily walk schedule, Zella does need ample time each day to run and explore freely. For this reason, she will be happiest in a home with a securely fenced yard to play in safely.\n\nZella is crate trained and house trained. She is looking forward to meeting her new forever family.",

I love to play and enjoy giving my love to my humans. I know how to sit, shake, and jump on command. That is pretty cool, right?\n\nI am not a fan of other dogs or cats, so I do need to be the only pet in the house. But you know what? I have such a strong personality that you will never miss having another dog!\n\nMy vitals? I am 4 years old, 55 pounds a Pittie and a Boxer mix. Sound just right for you? Then come meet me!!!!\n\n** If our dogs are posted online, they are available but may have other applications. To meet any dog, please fill out a short application in at CanineCollective.org. Our volunteers will process in about one business day and when approved you can text our kennel manager to make an appointment to meet/adopt your new forever companion. **",

He is non-reactive to small and female dogs, but needs a slow intro to alpha males. He loves going for walks and does great on a leash, but loves snuggling his human the most!\n\nAll he wants is a human (or family) to be his best friend, and let him lay his head in their lap.\n\nWhoever adopts him is going to be in for SO much love and appreciation!\n\nForever home application: https://puptowngal.formstack.com/forms/adoption_application",

            "description": "Say Hello to the Idyllwild Pups! These little Labrador Retriever mixes are the sweetest pups ever. They are around 2 months old and looking for families to play with, explore with, cuddle with, and love! They were born in a foster home where they received the very best care and lots of love. Their beautiful, sweet mama, Idyllwild, is on the medium to large side at about 40 lbs. We don't know dad or what exactly these pups are mixed with so are guessing that these cuties will grow up to be medium to large sized dogs like mom. Cove is looking for a family that understands the time, patience, and energy needed to raise a young pup. We require all puppy adopters to provide training that includes: house training, basic training, leash training, and socialization. Additionally, this cutie is going to need proper exercise, mental stimulation, and your attention and love to grow up to be the best companion. We do not allow our dogs or puppies to sleep or live outside; they must be incorporated into your family and be made a priority in your life. In return, you will have the most loving and loyal family member you could ask for. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting a puppy, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! Please note that processing time for applications is currently three to four weeks. We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs. Thank you for rescuing.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue. Please take a moment and go to www.labsandmore.org and click on Adopt to complete our online dog adoption application. If you have any questions email us at doginfo@labsandmore.org or call us at 858-273-5386. Thank you for looking to a rescue group to fulfill your dream of adding a new dog to your life!

            "description": "Hello there, my name is Lily. I'm currently residing off site, getting some much needed R&R. Life as a shelter pup can be stressful and we all need some \"\"me\"\" time every now and then. The staff at Nuzzles has learned lots about me, and what they've found is that I'm a picky girl who needs a very specific home. The thing is, I didn't live the best life before coming to Nuzzles, so I'm very leery of strangers. Sometimes I just hang my head and try to avoid them and other times I try and scare them away by barking. I feel misunderstood a lot of the time, and will need an owner who is patient, kind, and gentle. I need a quiet home with just one to two people who will be committed to following my behavior modification plan. I'm \"\"dog selective\"\" meaning I keep a tight circle of friends, so another dog isn't necessarily a deal breaker, but we definitely need to do a meet and greet before adoption. I've been working really hard becoming my best self, but certain things are deal breakers for me. First is cats. To me, they look like toys and I just don't understand why everyone keeps telling me I can't chase them! Second is children. They are small, loud, and move way too quickly for my taste. I know I've got some quirks, and that I'm not the dog for everybody but I still dream of having a family to call my own.

We are told that she has been around children and a small dog and did fine.

Telluride is a shy and modest guy who prefers to sit back and watch from the sidelines rather than getting into the thick of the action himself. He gets along very well with all dogs. He will just need a little extra love and patience to help him out of his shell, and blossom into his best self!\n\nIf you'd like to meet this pup, please visit www.thebarkinglot.net/adoptTo initiate the adoption process for this dog, please complete our online application by clicking below.

            "description": "Levi Strauss is the full package: athletic, playful and oh so handsome. If you're looking for the best of both worlds - a quiet homebody and an adventurous trail buddy - this big, beautiful dog is for you! Levi's idea of the perfect day involves going on long walks or hikes where he can sniff the good scents, and maybe even take a little dip in the water. Later on, he'd like to jump in the car (where he's always on his best behavior) for a burger at P. Terry's drive-thru. Then he would love to cap it off with a nice long nap on the couch. After he gets his second wind, Levi's ready to play fetch in the play yard or soak in the kiddie pool. At home, Levi prefers the quiet companionship of his person. This sensitive pup needs a low traffic lifestyle without many visitors. He's house-trained, and has been left free roam without a problem. He's just as comfortable being in the crate, and will sometimes even bring his toys in there to play. Levi figures out the rules of the house quickly, such as being allowed on the couch for snuggles, but not the bed. He's also working on his skills with his TOP (Total Obedience Program) trainer. Check out a video on APA's CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193 Are you ready to bring home a new best friend who will stay by your side through thick and thin? Levi Strauss is your guy! Follow Levi Strauss on Instagram @adopt_levi_strauss",

I just know that I love everyone and everything I meet. \n*insert puppy shrug here *\n\nI love dogs. I love cats. I love kids. I love old folks.  Heck! I even love grumpy, overwhelmed middle aged women!  I give lots of snuggles and tail wags to help them all. \n\nI walk beautifully on a leash. I never bark. I LOVE getting back scratches from anyone and anything. You name it- I\u2019ll ask it to scratch me. I\u2019m housetrained and go easily into my crate (when properly bribed, of course!) , and I still have enough pep in my step to run with my human foster brother. \nI may have a bit of gray in my beard,  but I have a lot of love to give and life to enjoy. I\u2019ll be finding my forever family soon and I can\u2019t wait! \n\nTo adopt me you can visit the website at rescueapittie.org to fill out an application online.  \n",

His paperwork says he's a Yorkie/Poodle Mix but we definitely see Schnauzer in that wiry hair and square face. He's a great size; small enough to be carried but not small enough to be stepped on. His tail is a little nub and his ears are nothing but goofy.\n\nAce is a sweet dog. He gets along great with other dogs and cats and has no issues with aggression or resource guarding. He loves curling up in a bed or a pile of blankets and he doesn't even snore. He rides well in the car and is a very quiet fellow. Ace believes that mealtime should be all the time and gets super excited when it's time for food. He's not a picky eater and enjoys both dry and canned foods.\n\nAce is an old dog. He takes medications for his joints but does have some weakening of his back end. He is full of lumps and bumps, doesn't see or hear well, and gets confused easily. Offering Ace a treat is a dangerous task, as he sometimes mistakes your fingers for the treat and chomps hard. He likes to go outside and is happy to potty out there, but he also has plenty of accidents in the house and is not consistent with a pee pad. Wandering around throughout the day and into the night sometimes leads Ace through his accidents and makes a bigger mess, but he doesn't notice so he's not sorry. Offering Ace a pat on the head confuses him and makes him nervous, but he likes body scratches once he figures out what's going on.\n\nAce is not a dog for everyone. He can not live with small children or with someone who will not have patience for his quirks and age-related issues. But he is a good boy and we are committed to finding him a real home! Ace is neutered, current on vaccines, heartworm negative, and had a dental cleaning 12/8. His bloodwork was normal.",

Lily was picked up from a breeder by her owner and then taken home. After getting home, the owner noticed that Lily would not eat or drink and that she just wanted to sleep in her crate. By the next morning, the owner found Lily unresponsive and took her to local Veterinary Specialty Hospital and asked that she be put to sleep. The Veterinary asked the owner to surrender the dog and then they called CTDR and we jumped into action to try and give Lily the care she needed.

For those who have completed an application or inquired about the puppies, we are working on responding to each of you.  Thank you to everyone looking to adopt through rescues.\n\n\nMeet the Reindeer Litter!  Blitzen, Comet, Dancer, and Prancer.  These pups are all males and believed to be Terrier mixes, possibly Lab or hound, but that\u2019s a guess. We do not how big they will be as adults but problem medium size.   On December 11, they were estimated to be 8 weeks and 7 days old.   They will be available for adoption after December 31, 2020.\n\nThey have received their first vaccination and will be microchipped.",

Luckily Herding Haven took me into rescue and fixed my leg.  I had to wear a cast and \"rest\" for what seemed like an eternity (my foster mom says it was only a couple of weeks), but that's like 6 months in dog years! Don't let my serious pictures fool you;  I'm a happy-go-lucky,  spunky little red head.  I love to play with other dogs, go for walks and chase frisbees. I'm a sock thief (but, I don't chew them) and a cuddle bug.  I love attention and show my happiness with little \"snorts\" of joy (my foster mom things I am part piglet!). I am house-broken, crate-trained, spayed and up-to-date on my vaccinations.  I would love an active family who will take me on lots of fun adventures.  If you are interested in meeting me, please contact kathie@herdinghaven.org",

            "description": "Nicolas is a 9 year old boy who is in desperate need of a new family. The only family who has had him since he was a puppy has fallen in some hard times so they can't have Nicolas anymore. Nicolas is a very noble dog, despite being a grown dog he still has the energy of a young one, he loves to play fetch with any toy you present to him, he understands commands like sit, paw and come. Nicolas loves to be praised as well as being hugged and being given lots of kisses and belly rubs as a reward as well as treats. Nicolas enjoys spending time sitting in the sun, adores early morning walks and car rides, he stays quite still when you give him a bath, he is not hard to deal with. When it comes to people, Nicolas is very nice to them, he likes to meet new people and to be petted, he likes attention. When it comes to kids he is nice to them but a family with kids over the age of 10 would be ideal since he can play a little rough sometimes. Unfortunately Nicolas was not really socialize with other animals so he will do better in a home where he can be the only pet. \n\nIf interested in Nicolas please visit our website www.bravebullyrescue.org and fill out our adoption application.",

I'm a big boy at 71 lbs and I LOVE to snuggle, but I have to be under the covers. If you don't let me, I will push my way under there. I would prefer to be in a home without kids, they scare me. Some dogs I like, and others I don't so a home with no dogs will be ideal for me.. I think cats are fun to chase, and lizards and birds too. In fact, I will chase just about anything. I have been professionally trained so I'm a good boy, but don't leave food on the counter, I just can't help myself. I would love to be an energetic, cuddly, hilarious new addition to your family!\n\nIf you would like to add me to your family please email my mom at sasha.lindley22@icloud.com\n\nI am located in Texas but can be adopted out of state.",

I\u2019m very playful and energetic, but I\u2019m also a great listener (did you see my ears?) and am overall very well-behaved.\n I\u2019m a great work from home companion and will happily play with my toys or nap next to you while you work. I\u2019m a fast learner and have quickly mastered basic commands - I bet you could teach me some really cool tricks! \nI\u2019m completely house-trained and am working on crate training, but would prefer to sleep near my humans - I\u2019m a total snuggle bug. \nI\u2019m about 2 years old and full grown at around 60 lbs. \n\nI\u2019m a great companion and would fit in well in any home, though if there are other animals it would be best if they want to play with me just as much as I want to play with them!\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2020 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq",

            "description": "Senior Hearts Rescue and Renewal is the only licensed senior dog rescue organization in Western Pennsylvania. We do not have a shelter or a public facility. ALL of our dogs reside in foster homes in the greater Pittsburgh, PA area. \n\nWe are a 100% volunteer organization. Please respect our volunteers' time. If a dog is listed on PetFinder, he/she IS available for adoption. We cannot reply to messages, phone calls, and emails about a dog until we have received, reviewed, and approved an adoption application. \n\nOur ADOPTION application is found at www.seniorhearts.org Completing this application is the first step in our adoption screening process. You MUST complete the application in its entirety in order to be considered as a potential adopter.  Please select \"More About Us\" for further details on our adoption requirements.  You can meet a dog ONLY after we have completed our adoption approval process.\n\nIf you are looking at the dog below, it most certainly means the dog is available for adoption. We look forward to receiving your application in hopes that you are able to meet our adoption requirements and provide this dog with a loving furever home.\n\nA little about Noella...\n I weigh 14 pounds and am ONLY 7 years young...not your usual senior. I am healthy and active. In fact I am VERY active. I love playing with humans and toys. Tug of war is my favorite game. I especially love being outdoors and going on long walks.  The more walks the better for me.\n\nI am vision impaired. But it certainly doesn't bother me. Sure I need carried up and down stairs. But I don't weigh much. I am house trained and crate trained. I am in good health too.\n\nI get along with all dogs and I dont mind cats. In facts I like dogs so much that I require a dog sibling in my furever home. We can play together and cause quite a ruckus! \n\nI could be adopted into a family with older repectful children or I'd be a great companion for someone who just wanted to have fun.\n\nIf you are looking for a young senior dog with a little spunk then I am your girl.  I can be adopted within a two-hour radius of Pittsburgh, PA. If you are interested in giving me a furever home, you must first complete the adoption application at www.seniorhearts.org\n\nPlease note we are unable to respond to any inquiries about a listing. If a dog is listed here she is available for adoption. If you are interested in her you must FIRST complete an adoption application at www.seniorhearts.org\n",

He came into rescue on December 1st after being surrendered by his previous owner who had no experience with the breed.\n\nKiko is not only strikingly handsome, he is also smart, learns quickly, and wants to please the people around him. But he is also an adolescent Akita and wants to test his boundaries, so only Akita-experienced families (without small children, other dogs, or cats) will be considered.\n\nWant to Get One Step Closer to Adopting your New Furry Family Member?\n\nVisit our website at www.akitaangels.org.

That\u2019s how Jenny prefers things for a while--she needs some time to feel at home. Her foster mom says slowly, but surely, Jenny is showing the dog that is inside of her: \u201cEven though she\u2019s shy, I know she\u2019s in a good mood when she wiggles or hops up onto the couch enthusiastically!\u201d \n\nA patient family that\u2019s willing to play the long game when it comes to bringing Jenny out of her shell would suit her perfectly--the sights and sounds of the world are still pretty scary to her, so having your steadfast support through it all (and your couch snuggs at night) is all she asks for! She\u2019s got a mellow energy, so she\u2019s happy to stick around the house and yard to keep things low key until she builds the courage to take on more of the world.\n\nAn important note Jenny wanted to make sure we included is that she is a big fan of peanut butter, cheese, and perked up significantly with take out from Dave\u2019s Hot Chicken entered the house. She may be a bit of a DoorDash aficionado and would happily help you select the most delicious smelling dinners Los Angeles has to offer!\n\nJenny would prefer to be your only dog at home, but could potentially live with a feline friend with a proper introduction.\n\nAbout 3 years old and 50 pounds, Jenny is crate-trained, house-trained, micro-chipped, up to date on routine vaccinations and knows her basic commands.",

            "description": "Jax is an awesome and beautiful, very active Redtick Coonhound. You'd never guess that Jax is 10 years old by the energetic way he walks and his melodious voice. Jax loves to be with people and he gets excited when he sees his person in the morning and when he knows it is walk time. Jax used to live with 4 small, dominating dogs and so he gets along with other dogs. He wants to chase cats, so we do not think he'd be good for cats. Jax is a tame, fun dog who must be given up by his senior owner due to the owner's increasing challenges with his own age and the ability to care for Jax. Jax would be great for a person or family who enjoys walks and would spend time with him. Jax is better suited for a house with a yard. He's an energetic and adorable fellow! Adoption Donation: $250\n\nNo out of state applications and applications required prior to meet and greets.\n\nEmail homeslesstoforever@gmail.com for an application or submit at our website www.homelesstoforever.com\n\n****Due to the pandemic, we are not having adoption fairs. Meet and greets are invited once applications are received. Meet and greets can take place at the potential adopter's home, but with safe distancing and masks.\n\nAll of our animals are fixed, chipped, and up to date on vaccinations. Meet and greets are done AFTER the submission of an application.\n\nPlease click on our Petfinder page to the right for more details on adoption fairs.

She is a 5-6 year old, petite pitty girl with a beautiful brindle coat weighing in at about 55lbs. She is very loving and eager to please. She loves human affection and just craves to be near you. She likes to play with her toys, and loves to delight you with zummies all around the yard. If you are looking for a best friend, Diamond is the girl for you.\n\nAs Diamond continues to work on her confidence, it would be best for now that she be the only dog and in a home without young children. She does great with older kids (teenagers and older). Other than these limitations, Diamond is an amazing girl with so much love to give. \n\nFor more info, please contact East of Eden Rescue at eoerescue@yahoo.com. If you are interested in adopting Diamond, you can find our applications on our website at eoerescue.org \nThank you for considering saving a life through adoption!",

I'm Audi. Yep, just like the luxury car....zoom zoom!! I'm around 5 and a half years old (a lady never tells her age, right?) and I am SPECIAL!\n\nWhat does that mean, you wonder? Well, it means that I am deaf - but no way do I let that slow me down. These days, I feel like I could run to the moon and back - and that makes me so happy cuz I was pretty under the weather when I joined the ranks of NWBR several months ago. But thanks to their committed dedication and my foster family's love and care, I am doing SO much better and I feel great. I do have some medication to take for the rest of my life but it's nothing scary or complicated & I think it's kinda cool, actually - cuz I get peanut butter or cheese every day now. Woo hoo!! Score!! Anyway, back to the \"about me\" show...\n\nBecause I cannot hear, I am a bit of a \"shadow\" pup - meaning I feel a LOT more secure when I am with my people. So, yes, I will definitely follow you to the bathroom, outside, to the kitchen.....you name it, I am there! But I promise not to get in the way - I just like to see you, it makes me feel safe. Speaking of which, if you have to leave the house for a while, I am happy to curl up in my crate with a nice blankie and some classical opera or 70's funk to listen to. (It helps me get my meditation on.) Because I am super smart, I could totally learn hand signals if someone wants to teach me some, but I promise I really am just like other dogs and you don't have to be scared of adopting me just because I cannot hear. I am a great best friend! In fact, having another fur friend in my forever home would be awesome too - I live with a big and a small one in my foster home, and I was kind of nervous about them at first, but they are totally my peeps now! They taught me about toys - which are so cool, and playing - which I love to do. I love a good walk or romp in a good sized back yard, and I am learning that the world is a wonderfully interesting place to do zoomies in. Human kiddos are ok with me, though I prefer the ones who are bit older. Not because I don't like the little ones - I love all people!! It's just because the littles are super bouncy and holy moly, do they move really fast sometimes! Because I am deaf, that kinda makes me a little nervous.\n\nSo, now that you know more about me, would you be interested in giving me a chance to show you how much I can love you? I have been hanging out with my foster family for quite a while, and I am having a great time here - but I feel in my bones that a special forever family is out there just waiting for me to call my own!\n\nInterested in adopting Audi? Fill out the application here:\n\nhttps://www.nwboxerrescue.org/adoption-form\n\nIf you would like to adopt her, fill out an adoption application on our website www.nwboxerrescue.org\n\nLike us on facebook for more photos of this pretty girl, as well as other boxers we have available! www.facebook.com/northwestboxerrescue\n2/2/21 11:17 AM",

THANKS FOR YOUR ATTENTION AND CONSIDERATION \n\nMEET ARTIE\u2026.a cutie patootie 6-7 yr old, 9.5 lb (underweight, should be 10-11 lbs), cream/tan, Shih Tzu boy, who came from the East Valley Shelter, suspected of being hit by a car.  The only thing our vet could tell was that Artie had very dirty teeth and was matted (and smelly) to the bone!  His teeth have been cleaned, he\u2019s had his makeover and he\u2019s been given two thumbs up!! \n\nIf you look closely, Artie has one blue eye\u2026very unusual!  Even though his coat was a mess, we could tell that when you let it grow out, it will be very pretty (if groomed and kept up!)  Artie is a sweetheart who is very quiet and curious and we believe he was loved at some time.  We can tell you he isn\u2019t quite potty trained, but if kept on a schedule, he\u2019s getting better.  We have yet to hear him bark, so no worries there.   \n\nWe have gotten to know Artie better and he is still coming out of his shell.  He is asking for attention, follows us around and LOVES to be rubbed\u2026esp his ears and head!  He likes squeaky toys, but isn\u2019t sure what to do with them!  Finally, he is curious and wants to engage with the other dogs but they could care less\u2026but another interested dog in the home who is small and friendly would be best for little Artie because he does not like being left alone.    He is probably fine with kids, since he has no aggression.  A home where he will get oodles of attention and love is the home where Artie should be!!  Does that sound like yours?\n\nOur website is updated daily. Please do not apply for this dog unless your home fits the specified criteria. All of our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, groomed, vet checked, dewormed, deflea'd and come with a leash, collar and ID If you are interested in adopting this dog from Lhasa Happy Homes, please complete the adoption application via the link below: Adoption (Online) Application: https://lhasahappyhomes.org/adoptions/adoption-application/. We will contact you once it has been reviewed. \n\nDuring the COVID-19 quarantine, Lhasa Happy Homes will NOT be holding weekly adoption events. We will set up individual meet & greets with APPROVED applicants once they have submitted a video tour of their home. \n\nYou can check our Events Calendar at http://www.lhasahappyhomes.org/HLM_Custom_Calendar.aspx.\n\nThanks for thinking rescue and adoption\u2026and for considering saving a life. It will be the best gift you ever give yourself or your family.",

Ragan's needs are very simple: she wants her humans to be around more than they are gone, and she wants to be loved, adored and the center of your attention. She's a 8/9 year old Lab mix. Although she has lived with dogs in the past, she is more comfortable being the only pup. She is child-friendly, but because of her blindness she would be more comfortable with older children and teens. She is not a fan of cats. Ragan copes well with her lack of sight; using snapping fingers, clicker or specific words to help guide her. If you are looking for a gentle and even-tempered companion that only wants to be where you are (especially next to you on the couch) please come meet our affectionate and lovable Ragan. If interested, please contact Our Companions at 860-242-9999 or email Helpline@OurCompanions.org.\n\n",

This jovial fella came to us with his fur sister, Meadow, after their owner fell ill.  \n\nBeau is around twelve years old and is a lover of life!   He enjoys spending time with people although folks wearing backwards ball caps or baggy clothes make him extremely nervous.  Sadly, we are thinking the first years of his life may not have been so great.   Beau has never been around kiddos or kitties, but did well his companion Meadow.  \n\nBeau is scheduled to have his teeth cleaned and a lump on his gums removed.   We would love to find this boy a foster to adopt family!   He deserves it!   If you are interested in meeting Beau, please visit www.crcpa.org and complete an application.",

I am quiet and housebroken in my fosters home. I like other dogs and cats but don't really know how to play with them so I ignore them. I am at my happiest when on the move as is evident in the videos below. True to hound dog behavior I like to explore and will wander off if left alone and not come back on my own. So an ideal home for me would be with an active individual or family with older dog-savvy kids, a fenced yard and another dog who is willing to teach me how to trust, play, and relax. It will take me sometime to build a relationship of trust so I hope my future person is very patient with me. I am a low maintenance, low to medium energy dog but still need to stretch my long legs and get exercise. You can see how much I love to run in the 3rd video.\n\nClick here and here to see more. .\n\nClick here and here to see him in action!\n\nThis is what we do know about English Spot: \n\nHe is crate trained. \nWalks very well on a leash.\nHe ran a 5k with 100+ other dogs and was in his element.\nHe's a very lovable dog, not a mean bone in his body.\nHe loves to sit on the couch with his human foster brother. \nHe came into a Virginia shelter as a stray with some head wounds. \nWas treated for heartworm.\nHe is a creature of habit and is sensitive to change. \nBecause he is shy, he likes to hide and put himself in corners. \nHe will not seek your affection but when hes relaxed in his environment he will follow your movements with his eyes. \nHe doesn't play with his 4-legged foster siblings but we see glimpses of a desire to learn. \nHes looking for that perfect active person who is willing to be patient and understanding with him. \n\nIf you feel that English Spot is a dog you could love knowing that he will require a lot of patience, proactive energy and time then please apply to adopt at www.OPHrescue.org.\n\nTo adopt this dog, or any OPH dog, fill out the simple online application at https://ophrescue.org \nOperation Paws for Homes, Inc. (OPH) rescues dogs of all breeds and ages from high-kill shelters in NC, VA, MD, and SC, reducing the numbers being euthanized. With limited resources, the shelters are forced to put down 50-90% of the animals that come in the front door. OPH provides pet adoption services to families located in VA, DC, MD, PA and neighboring states. OPH is a 501(c)(3) organization and is 100% donor funded. OPH does not operate a shelter or have a physical location. We rely on foster families who open their homes to give love and attention to each dog before finding a forever home.",

I need a home with kids age  6+.\n\nHi my name is Fudge! I\u2019m 8 months old and 40 lbs! I\u2019m very shy and would do best in a home with another canine companion to keep me company and show me the ropes! I am lacking some confidence but thats okay!\n\nI just arrived to ODHS but the humans promised to update my bio as they learn more about me! \n\nYou can still come adopt me or even join our foster program to help the humans learn all the awesome things about new dogs like me! Learn more on our website! \n\nHope to see you soon! \n\nWhat breed am I? Mixed mutt! ODHS does not breed label (unless there\u2019s official paperwork), as studies show it is nearly impossible to tell the exact breed of each dog based off of their appearance.\n\nEducational articles:\n3/3/3 Rule;\nhttps://www.rescuedogs101.com/bringing-new-dog-home-3-3-3-rule/?fbclid=IwAR2iv5m7fqk3FieO7LOsstGeGsYYV_F1rJOd1BPxaImofLpcinpYsUbFRWs\n\nAdoption Donations are $250 for an adult, $350 for puppies (a dog under one year of age), and $125 for a senior dog (based on the age of the dog). Adoption donations are to be made via cash, and credit/debit card. There is a $5 fee to run cards. ail you back.\n\nAs a puppy, I am required to go to training within 90 days of my adoption with a certified trainer. Paws and Heels is recommended. \n\nPlease remember to bring a collar and leash (non-retractable) with you the day of the adoption. Note: Martingale collars and slip leads are strongly recommended.\n\nDue to COVID19, we aren't having as many open, public adoption events.  Current schedule is pre-determined meet and greet appointments are Wednesday evenings and on Saturday from 12-2. \nOur adoption center is located at 3602 Lafayette Blvd, Suite 102, Fredericksburg, VA 22408. It's important that you keep an eye on your emails for any changes or updates during the adoption process.\n\nVisit our website for an application to adopt. \nhttps://www.olddominionhumanesociety.org/adoption-application\n\nOld Dominion Humane Society is a volunteer based organization.

            "description": "Crackers was originally part of a hoarding situation in the Tulsa area. The lady turned many dogs over to local rescues, but was allowed to keep 4 dogs. Snowbell and Crackers were two of the dogs that she kept. Unfortunatly a year later she passed away. The dogs then found themselves at Tulsa Animal Welfare. A foster family took the chihuahuas in to get them out of the shelter. They then came here to ARF. Snowbell is still nervous, but is a sweet dog. Her and Crackers are bonded and we would love for them to be adopted together.\n\nFill out an application at the link below. Find the dog/cat you are interested in and click the adopt button. That will take you to an application. Once approved you will be called for an appointment to meet your possible new family member, or at that time you can meet the other animals as well. https://petstablished.com/public/search/shelter/301551\n\nAdoption fee is $150 which includes, spay/neuter, vaccines, etc, and a free 1 year membership to our 5 acre ARF Park. For other dog questions please email ARFdogs74006@gmail.com\n\nWe do adopt out of state, but the adopter must travel to ARF to meet the dog they are looking to adopt. They must have an approved application before traveling to meet the dog. We do allow small dogs that are eligible to fly in the cabin of a plane. We DO NOT allow dogs to travel in the cargo area of the plane under any circumstances. Any dog that is adopted can of course go by personal vehicle. We do not allow dogs to be transported \"pony express style\" where they are passed from driver to driver.",

Playful towards other dogs in the foster or other people's homes. He LOVES saying hi, so does often pull on the leash toward other dogs while out on walks.\nObservations with Cats: Untested\nObservations with Kids: Untested\nHouse Training Progress: No recent accidents.\nCrate Training Progress: Does well in crate\nLocation: DC area foster\nRescued From: Columbus County, NC\nAdditional Information: Bartlett (Bart for short) is such a sweet boy and will approach you throughout the day for some ear scratches, which are his favorite. He loves long walks but is also content napping during the day as long as he gets a significant amount of exercise first. He is super friendly, and loves to say hello to everyone (humans, kids, dogs). Bartlett can be stubborn during walks, happily trotting where he wants or stopping in his tracks, but he has started to improve with training. Bartlett knows the word sit and is learning the words down, come, and off! This funny boy is sometimes scared to go through doorways, but with a little encouragement, he will go through and return to his happy self. Bartlett loves outings to the dog park, where he runs like a deer! He is a playful boy who needs to burn off his energy.\n\n*Bartlett is sponsored and named by Sara Swezy. Thank you for saving a life, Sara! \n\n__________________________________\n\nIf you are interested in meeting a dog or cat, we require an adoption application. If the animal has \"HAS APPLICATION\" listed, they are still available to receive additional applications but also may be in the process of being adopted soon. Apply for a DOG: http://www.citydogsrescuedc.org/adoptable-dogs.html\n\nInterested in saving more lives? Foster a dog today! Learn more, see our list of dogs needing foster, and apply, https://www.citydogsrescuedc.org/foster-a-city-dog.html\n\nCity Dogs Rescue & City Kitties is a foster-based rescue in Washington, DC. We do not have a shelter. We focus on local adoptions in DC and the metro area of Maryland and Virginia. CDR&CK has a thorough adoption process in order to find the best possible fit for each of our dogs and cats (we do not operate under a first-come, first-served model).\n\nUpon accepting a new cat or dog into the organization, we provide a basic vet visit that includes necessary vaccinations, disease screenings, deworming, microchips, and spay/neuter (unless specified). We do not provide a comprehensive medical exam prior to adoption. As a result, sickness, injury, and disability may exist unbeknownst to CDR&CK. City Dogs Rescue & City Kitties is not responsible for payment of any vet care, including known and unknown medical conditions once a cat or dog is adopted from us. \nDog specific: Rabies, DHPP, Bordatella vaccines. They are tested for HW, Lyme, Ehrlichia, Anaplasmosis.\n\nMost cats and dogs will have a house training accident in the initial days in their new home and we cannot guarantee any pet is housebroken or crate trained.\n\nWe also update our Facebook page daily with new cats and dogs.",

I feel most comfortable with a friend or two by my side, so I would do best in a home with another dog. I would be a great addition to your family if you know a thing or two about training me to grow up to be a well mannered lady. I can be a little skittish at times, so I believe I will do best in a home with no children or older children.

He is playful and loving, gets along well with other dogs and is great with kids. He would do great on a farm/in the country, or in a home that has a securely fenced yard and lots of love to give. He loves kids and would make a great family dog. He would also be a great dog for someone who loves to get outdoors and has time to give him the attention he deserves.\n\nAge: 3 years\n\nWeight: 65 lbs\n\nTemperament: Gets along with kids, dogs, no cats\n\nTraining: house trained, good on leash\n\nVetting: neutered, up-to-date on vaccines and heartworm negative\n\nEmail for questions: gabi.washburn@gmail.com\n\nTo ensure we're meeting both pet and adopters' needs, we ask potential adopters to complete an Adoption Application ( www.bit.ly/DH-Adoption ) for caretakers to review. Once approved, we will bring the adoptable pet to your home for a preliminary visit. We are 100% donation funded; unless otherwise noted above, please expect a minimal adoption fee of $250 to cover each pet's basic vetting.",

She is now in a foster home with other dogs and is improving but will still need patience and love. She will try to escape if left alone and has severe separation anxiety. She cannot be left in a crate as this will reverse the progress she has made. She would do best in a home with someone who has the time and energy to permit her to grow into the wonderful dog she will become and who has a quiet household and not a lot of people coming in and out. Goldie will also need a home with another dog so she can learn and build her confidence. She has no fear around big dogs and just wants love. She will be a great addition to any loving home!

He loves to be pet and will wag his tail even though you can tell he is scared. He will make a very sweet companion with love and patience. Russell came in with Oakley and they love to play together so please consider both.\nplease message Erin at muellenbergerin@gmail.com to schedule a meet and greet or to receive an electronic application. Thank you!\n\n---\n\nCome meet our dogs Saturdays and Sundays at Petsmart in Costa Mesa from 11:30-2:30. All A Home 4 Ever Rescue dogs receive a wellness exam by our veterinarian and are up to date with vaccinations. They are spayed or neutered and microchipped before they go to their adoptive families.

            "description": "Friends to the Forlorn\nAdopt-a-BullBreed: Pitbull Terrier\n\nGender: Female\n\nEstimated Date of Birth: September 26, 2017\n\nLocation: Dallas, Ga\n\nABOUT BLUEBELLE\nBluebelle found herself at animal control, along with her nine puppies, after her owner called AC on his own dogs when she become protective of her puppies. She remained protective of her puppies at the pound and other rescue groups would not touch an aggressive mom. When they started to get sick, they became urgent; AC was considering separating mom and pups, as other groups would likely take the puppies alone, but that's not how we work. At FTTF, we don't take puppies without the mother. Thankfully, one of our amazing foster homes stepped up to foster the entire family so we were able to bring all ten into FTTF.\n\nBy the time we got them, all were all very sick with pneumonia. We rented an oxygen generator and built a chamber for them but, even with around-the-clock care, we lost four pups. However, thanks to the amazing care given by their foster family and everyone at New Hope Animal Hospital, Bluebelle and her five remaining pups fully recovered and continue to show how resilient and incredible they are! Today, they are all thriving. Bluebelle will be available for adoption once she is fully vetted and spayed.\n\nOur adoption fee is $300. All dogs are current on vaccinations, spayed or neutered, micro-chipped, on heartworm prevention, and fed premium grain-free food.www.savingpitbulls.org",

Our adoption fee is $400-$800. Each biography will specifically list the adoption fee.Adoption Fee: $500\nDue to his level of under socialization, we are open to a foster to adopt situation for Jughead.\nJughead is a 1 year old Jack Russell Terrier mix who came to us from a hoarding situation where he and his nine siblings were left in a backyard, and thus emerged super under-socialized. In his foster home, he is slowly learning that people can be trusted, and he has benefitted from the presence of another dog in the home. That said, he still needs a lot of work to learn that he is safe with people. He came into his foster home completely terrified but now enjoys being near his foster mom and has proved to be a great work-from-home companion. On occasion, he has even been known to cuddle.\nJughead can be very loyal once he learns to trust. He enjoys laying near his foster mom and doesn't disturb her meetings. He is happy just as long as he has his blankets to lay on and likes it when you are in one place so he doesn't have to move around. He is really great with other dogs and would make a great playmate for a dog that likes to play. He has shown he can improve with patience, sometimes cuddling his foster mom in bed and letting her pet him. We are very positive that with love and patience he will make a perfect pup.\nThis is how his foster mom describes his current schedule:\n'First thing he does is get up and go to the bathroom with my dogs. He then goes back to bed for about an hour before he gets up again to eat. He likes to play a bit in the am before he settles back down and takes naps with my dogs. He gets up several times a day to go outside then play a little. He does like having a toy to chew on during the day as well. In the afternoon he is the most active and likes romping around with my dogs and taking walks. He naps in the evening and eats his dinner. When he hears us set our house alarm, he knows it is time for bed and runs in our room and jumps on the bed to go to sleep.'\nJughead loves playing with the other two dogs in his foster home and would do best in a home that has other dogs already, thus applicants that have one will be given priority in the interview process.\nJughead is only an option for homes that have had a dog of their own as an adult. Dog sitting and family pets do not count. If there are any children in the home they need to be over the age of ten.",

He does have a protector personality.  I have a complete medical file on him and his vaccines are up to date.  I am looking for a home where he is seen more as a companion than just a dog and where he will be fiercely loved.  Please email me with any questions.\nNikki Goodman\nsweeneyxoxo@mindspring.com",

As you can imagine, he likes to take in new things at his own pace. He can be a bit shy while he reorients himself in a new environment or around new people, but he will steal your heart (and your couch, if you let him!) in no time. New dogs have made him nervous so far, but it's possible that he may be able to get along with other dogs if introduced slowly. \n\nCharlie's favorite activities include snuggling up next to his humans and getting gentle face rubs. He's a smart boy who has already acclimated to his crate training, knows to follow on a leash by listening to where you are, and is ready to keep learning more!\n\nCharlie loves to play with toys, and tug of war is his favorite game so far. But give him a blanket and you might be in for a surprise - he loves to rub his face in it and hop around like an excited little bunny. Charlie's endearing quirks have won over the hearts of everyone who has met him - shelter staff, his fosters, and of course his rescue family. If you'd like to be the next heart stolen by Charlie, send in your application!\n\nCharlie is just over a year old, 78 pounds, and ready for his forever home.

She\u2019s not a barker and she\u2019s house & crate trained! She has not been exposed to children since she\u2019s been with us but she has shown zero signs of aggression with anything or anyone.

            "description": "Hutch aka Jackson is bouncy happy guy who has been starved for attention and neglected for too long.  While we don\u2019t know the specifics of his history, we can surmise that he had been an outside dog until he came to us, likely confined to a kennel with a dog house.  He came to us by way of the Perry County Dog Shelter as an unclaimed stray who tested positive for heartworm disease.  He has been in out care for several months now as he underwent treatment for his heartworm disease as well as learning to live like an inside dog and enjoying every day attention and individualized walks.  He is an energetic guy and looks forward to playing in the snow this winter with his new family and then curling up on a new dog bed to dream of all the good things to come.  Hutch is very sweet and loving....  He\u2019s not suited for living with cats and will do best if not exposed to other dogs--he lives with other dogs in his foster home but that was after a very slow controlled introduction..  We are estimating him to be a middle aged (maybe 5-6 ish) dog, likely Lab and another sporting breed mix.  He is approximately 70lbs. Vet reference required  No invisible fence and would do best with a 6 ft privacy fence.\n\nThis is a lovely note from a family that kept Hutch for a week, unfortunately he was not a good fit for them but they were hoping this would help him find the right home:\n\nHutch is very affectionate and loves to sit, sleep,\nand walk close to you. He made us think of the\ntraits of a golden retriever.\nWe noticed he that he is anxious when separated.\nHe did not like to be crated but he accepted his\n\u201cfate\u201d and joyfully embraced your return. That\nmight all change once he settles into your home\nand knows this is his safe place.\nHe loves baby carrots and ice cubes for snacks.\nHe loves to trash pick tissues from open trash cans\nand is a counter surfer. House training was easy,\njust had to be shown where to go. He paces when\nhe needs to go outside. He is eager to please so\nwith training those issues will be eliminated.\nWe believe he will be best placed in a home with a\nfence and no cats. Wait to introduce other dogs.\nHe LOVES to chase squirrels which is great in the\nyard, not so good when walking him. Trainable fix.\nHutch will warm your heart and be a great addition\nto any family. He loves children. Avoid balls and\nstuffed toys that squeak. He loves to carry them\naround but tears up for the squeaker.\nLove him and he will return that love 110%.\n\nAdoption fee $150\n\nIf you would like to meet Hutch please complete an application for adoption. LINK TO APPLICATION IS BELOW\nCopy and paste link into your browser\nhttp://fs17.formsite.com/adoptionscc/form1/index.html\n\n\nAny vaccinations/boosters due after adoption is finalized will be the new owner's responsibility. All animals are current at time of adoption but in some cases a booster series is required or a vaccine cannot be given due to age and cannot be completed prior to adoption\n\nOur adoptable animals come to us from various sources, the most common being from an animal shelter who is unable to handle their physical or mental needs in the shelter setting but believe with the appropriate care, they can become adoptable. Adoption fees vary based on age, needs and sponsoring.\n",

As you can see by Sam's ears his life hasn't always been pleasant but he tries very hard to be a good mannered boy.  He is affectionate with the volunteers and staff though it does take him time to warm up to new people.  He doesn't like strangers, loud noises, or quick, sudden movements.  Those things trigger something within him from his past that make him uneasy.  Sam would do well in a home without any other pets, no children and an extremely patient and loving adopter.  His adopter needs to remember Sam has had a hard life and deserves only the best, lots of treats, snuggles, and love.  Sam walks very well on the leash and loves to go for his daily walk.   Everyone at the shelter is rooting for this sweet boy to find his forever home.  \n\nFor more information, please contact Isle of Wight County Animal Services at 757-365-6318.",

Please make sure to read the adoption fee below in the bio.\n\nBREEDS: We are not breed experts. The breed(s) listed for each adoptable are best guesses or suggestions.\n\nSTEPS TO ADOPT:\n\nRead the adoptable\u2019s bio below, including their adoption fee\n\nRead \u00a0ADOPTION PROCESS page under the \"Adopt\" section\n\nComplete the \u00a0DOG ADOPTION APPLICATION (located on our website RARErescue.org)\n\n*Applications will be attended to before general inquiries. We may or\u00a0may not\u00a0have time to respond to general inquiries if you have not submitted an application.\n\nWe understand that it is important to you to find the right fit for your family. We feel the same way! The application is important and necessary for this reason.\u00a0\n\nAll of our Adoptables are:\n\n*spayed/neutered\n*up to date on vaccines\n*heartworm tested if six months or older (and kept on heartworm preventative and treated for heartworms if positive when entering our program)\n*microchipped prior to adoption\n\nBASIC INFORMATION:\n\nSuggested Breed(s): Boxer/Australian Cattle Dog\nGender:\u00a0Male/Neutered\nApprox. Age or D.O.B:\u00a0Approx 2-3 years\nApprox. Weight:\u00a065 lbs\nCoat Type: Short\nGood around most dogs: Yes\nGood around most cats:\u00a0Yes\nEnergy Level: Medium\nFence yard may be required: Yes, fenced yard required\nAny other specifics:\u00a0\u00a0 Check out that face!! Dawson is an adorable guy with a goofy personality and he had so much fun at the Christmas parade we attended last week!\u00a0\nWe're thinking he's a boxer/cattle dog mix from his characteristics, but he thinks he's a lap dog! Dawson needs a fenced yard do play in but he certainly can chill and hang out in the house too. He's great with other dogs and ignores cats.\u00a0\nDawson does not like to be kept outside, especially in a pen. He loves to be indoors with his people and he is house trained and crate trained! Dawson has put on some muscle since he has been in our foster home so he's a strong boy, but all heart. He tends to pull on a leash when he gets excited, so his adopter\u00a0will need to be willing continue working on the training that we've started with him.\u00a0\n\nWill you be a Hero in Dawson's story?\n\nVisit our website/Click on Adopt to APPLY today!\u00a0 RARErescue.org\n\nAdoption Fee: $185.00\n\n\n\nPlease REMEMBER, All of our Adoptables are:\n\n*spayed/neutered\n*up to date on vaccines\n*heartworm tested if six months or older (and kept on heartworm preventative and treated for heartworms if positive when entering our program)\n*microchipped prior to adoption\n\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE: We are a non-profit organization without municipal or government funding. Veterinary/Medical expenses are constant for an animal rescue. Our adoption fees not only help to provide vetting and care for the animal being adopted, but they also help to cover heartworm treatments and other treatable ailments that many animals, that would otherwise be euthanized, need in order to be made available for adoption.\n\n\nPlease understand that adopting an animal is a LIFETIME COMMITMENT to that animal and there will be veterinary expenses throughout their life that can often cost several hundreds, if not thousands of dollars (without pet insurance), especially without annual checkups and preventative care.\u00a0 As a potential family for this pet you are responsible for their safety and that includes keeping them on your property.\n\n***If you are not in the middle Tennessee area, transport can potentially be arranged to approved homes, depending on distance and local adaptability. We normally do not allow adoptions outside of 1.5 hours driving distance.\n\nThank you for choosing to adopt, foster, or aid in the rescue efforts of RARE!",

            "description": "Breed:  Labrador Retriever mix, possibly with Pit Bull\nAge:  as of 1.7.21, 8 months\nWeight:  54 lbs.\nGood with dogs:  yes\nGood with cats:  unsure\nGood with kids:  no kids under 8 yrs.\nEnergy level:  medium to high\nGood with men/strangers:  yes\nHypoallergenic:  no\n\nSpecial home requirements or medical:  needs a secure yard and another dog\n\nAdditional info:\n\nOzzy is a big happy puppy who gets the biggest wiggle butt when meeting new people! He loves attention and his person so does have some separation anxiety.  He is extremely playful and a very active pup that needs a secure yard to play in and would benefit from having another dog to play with or an active person that can work with him on basic training, socialization and give him regular long walks or runs. When playing, he can be mouthy and given his size he is very strong so it's best he not be in a home with little people, so no kids under the age of 8 years. Ozzy is a young very rambunctious boy and barks at noises that startles him so he should not be in a home with shared walls. When he gets proper exercise he does become calm and will chill at your feet for a good nap. He is still growing and can possibly grow to be around 80 lbs.\n\nINTERESTED IN THIS PUP?

He does have a few quirks so he is looking for just the right home that will be best for him. He gets along great with his fur sister and they play constantly. However, he does not like having a fur brother. Small children make him nervous but he is fine with his older 2 legged siblings. He is kennel trained and knows simple commands (sit, stay, lay down, shake). He is very smart and is a fast learner.

Gordon walks beautifully on a leash and knows his basic manners .  We feel it would be best for this boy to join a nice quiet environment where he will be treated like a prince and receive the love and attention that he really has not been privy too. Gordon is very affectionate and gives lots of kisses ! He would love to snuggle up on the couch with you for an afternoon nap or to watch a movie . We have been told he is diagnosed with a heart murmur and may need some medication in the future , but for now this boy is spunky and happy as can be ! This boy has truly won over our hearts here at the shelter - I\u2019d be very surprised if you did not feel the same once meeting him - if interested please come visit Gordon.",

            "description": "Updated: 01/26/2021\nMeet Jolene!!! She's about 3 years old, she was a skinny 45 lbs when she arrived from TX a few weeks ago, but has been in weight-gain mode and is filling out nicely. Jolene loves to have a warm body to cozy up to, she prefers the warm touch of her humans but will settle for the comfort of her foster sister dog as well. When you come home or simply come back into her view after a bit, she acts as though she hasn't seen you in years, she will always make you feel loved. She loves to play with her toys, especially tug of war. She is totally housebroken, she does her business like clockwork which makes for easy bathroom breaks in the cold weather. She enjoys car rides, especially if it involves a trip to the dog park or picking up her human foster sister and brother. Jolene can be as active or as content as you would like, she will join you on 5 mile runs, but will also settle next to you on the couch if you just don't have the energy that day. She has been a great office dog, my husband works from home, and he can conduct his business with very little distractions from her. She likes to wake up early to use the bathroom and eat breakfast but usually goes back to bed afterwards, she doesn't seem to be a morning dog. We crate her at night, during the day she has the run of our kitchen and family room while my husband is on the second floor. We have had little to no incidents of chewing on things that do not belong to her. Her most active time of the day is between 2:00 pm and 8:00 pm when everybody is home and ready for some playtime. She loves doing laps outside or chasing tennis balls. Inside, she likes soft or rubber chew toys. Oh, and NO CATS! She can't resist chasing and the cats aren't interested in waiting around to see what happens next.\nShe's a dog that loves her her doggy friends but adores her humans of all ages, she can't wait to start her forever life!\nAdoption Fee: $475.00\nWe are a Wisconsin state licensed dog rescue -WI# 402433\n\n***We do not have a central adoption center at this time. All our dogs are in private foster homes within WI. At this time we only place our dogs in areas of WI. The breed of our dogs is our best guess with the help of our veterinarians.\nOur Weight Classes are as follows:\n0- 25lbs - Small\n26- 45lbs - Medium\n46-89 - Large\n90+ X-large\nIf you are adopting an adult dog, which we consider 6 months of age or older, your adoption fee includes the following:\nSpay/Neuter, Rabies and Distemper shots, dewormed, flea & tick preventative, heartworm tested and microchipped.\nIf you are adopting a dog younger than 6 months of age, the dog will be up to date on the shots as per the dogs age. The dog will be dewormed, flea/tick preventative and microchipped. We only spay/neuter our dogs by 6 months of age. If you decide to adopt a younger dog than 6 months of age, they will need to be spayed/neutered at one of our preferred clinics. This will be determined by your contract along with the month they should have their surgery. This is included in your adoption fee.\nOnce you are approved with our rescue, you can meet any one of our dogs within the fosters home. If you are interested in the dog you met, you can take the dog home under our mandatory foster to adopt program. You receive 5 days to see if the dog is the right fit for your home.\nIf it is, we will conduct the home visit and finalize adoption. If it is not, it is returned to the foster. We are happy to find you another dog that meets your needs in your home.\nIf a dog is listed as PENDING, a family has met the dog and planning on adopting the dog after the home visit has been conducted. We always suggest sending in an application for a dog because there are times where the dogs are given back to us under the foster to adopt program. There are many reasons dogs are returned but normally it just was not the right fit for all.Please go to WWW.TAILWAGGERS911.COM under HOW TO ADOPT . We have an online application that is very easy to fill out.",

            "description": "Updated: 1/25/2021\n\nHi, I'm Bandit. I am about 6 years old and weigh about 45 lbs. Now, if you've clicked on my profile, then I'm guessing you know the challenges that Border Collies can be, so please give me a chance and keep reading!\n\nI spent most of my life outside down in TX, and have been working hard to get used to life on the inside, and I'm proud to say I've done pretty well! I've still got a ways to go, though, so I'm not a first-time dog owner kind of guy. I've conquered stairs (those were scary), and I still keep an eye on that big screen TV! Every day I see something I haven't seen before, but will slowly learn that these things just aren't scary as long as there is someone there to guide me. So far, I've done best by following the other laid-back dog that lives here and listening to foster mom tell me \"you got this!\", that lets me know that none of this stuff will bother dogs! That means I *need* a confident doggy friend as I learn to navigate this whole new world, and a patient and dog-savvy family that will help build my confidence and understand my needs. But you can cross housetraining off my list - I have quickly figured out that *outdoors* is where dogs go to do their business then they can come back inside! I do love my crate, it's a safe spot for me to hide out, and I sleep in it through the night without a sound. I'm not protective of my food or treats, and am learning to take snacks gently. I quietly lie down and ignore you while you eat, and I won't steal your sandwich! I do have energy, but I am a bit older so it's not a crazy thing. We go for a 2-3 mile walk in the morning, and a 2 mile walk at night, and then I spend the rest of the day supervising my foster mom while she works. And on the weekends we get to go to the dog park, which I love! I'm not the best around really small dogs who are submissive in that setting, I can't resist the urge to herd them and that can freak them out. Oh, and I do the same to cats, which of course they hate! There's a big fenced in yard where I'm staying, so I can do laps and zoomies with the other dog as much as I want, but truly what I really want is to be by you as much as I can once I've had my fun. If I do encounter something outside I don't like, I will run - so I *need* that fenced in yard! I don't mind the cold at all and really love the snow, I roll around it in every time we go outside, but that's only if you're with me - if you head indoors, I'd rather come back in with you. I also ignore all those small furry things outside, like bunnies and squirrels and chipmunks, I'm just not interested in them. I'm learning how to play with toys, the ones with squeakers still freak me out, but I'm slowly picking my (quiet) favorites out of the toy chest and carrying them to my crate. Outside, my absolute favorite is herding a 5 gallon bucket around, it makes my foster mom laugh! I'm super friendly with new dogs, and I greet the people I meet in the neighborhood with a gentle tail wag and sweet butterfly kisses. I love quietly looking out the window on car rides, and you can touch my ears, paws, tail - I'm not touchy anywhere!\n\nSo here's the thing - my breed was bred to watch over my flock and bring them back by any means necessary, so no small children please. I don't need constant exercise, but I do need a family who understands my requirements - if I'm left to my own devices, I can develop my own little \"quirks\". Right now, I am scared of the random electronic beeps I hear in the house, and last week I decided that I was scared of the backyard. So even though I'm adorable, I need constant work to keep me mentally healthy! I know my basic commands like sit and lie down, and as I get more comfortable with my foster family, I'm learning to come when they call me, cause they always have a treat or a scratch to give me! I wouldn't do well in an apartment type setting which requires me to always be on leash. I'm really good on my leash, but I still need room to RUN, it's just what makes me happy. I'm also a quick learner, so maybe we could go for a good long run, or try agility, or search and rescue, or anything else that involves FUN with my people!\n\nIf you're looking for a smart, fun, affectionate boy, know all of the fun and challenges I will bring you, and have lots of patience, get your application in so we can meet and we can start our amazing life together!\n\nAdoption Fee: $475.00\n\nWe are a Wisconsin state licensed dog rescue -WI# 402433\n\n***We do not have a central adoption center at this time. All our dogs are in private foster homes within WI. At this time we only place our dogs in areas of WI. The breed of our dogs is our best guess with the help of our veterinarians.\nOur Weight Classes are as follows:\n0- 25lbs - Small\n26- 45lbs - Medium\n46-89 - Large\n90+ X-large\nIf you are adopting an adult dog, which we consider 6 months of age or older, your adoption fee includes the following:\nSpay/Neuter, Rabies and Distemper shots, dewormed, flea & tick preventative, heartworm tested and microchipped.\nIf you are adopting a dog younger than 6 months of age, the dog will be up to date on the shots as per the dogs age. The dog will be dewormed, flea/tick preventative and microchipped. We only spay/neuter our dogs by 6 months of age. If you decide to adopt a younger dog than 6 months of age, they will need to be spayed/neutered at one of our preferred clinics. This will be determined by your contract along with the month they should have their surgery. This is included in your adoption fee.\nOnce you are approved with our rescue, you can meet any one of our dogs within the fosters home. If you are interested in the dog you met, you can take the dog home under our mandatory foster to adopt program. You receive 5 days to see if the dog is the right fit for your home.\nIf it is, we will conduct the home visit and finalize adoption. If it is not, it is returned to the foster. We are happy to find you another dog that meets your needs in your home.\nIf a dog is listed as PENDING, a family has met the dog and planning on adopting the dog after the home visit has been conducted. We always suggest sending in an application for a dog because there are times where the dogs are given back to us under the foster to adopt program. There are many reasons dogs are returned but normally it just was not the right fit for all.Please go to WWW.TAILWAGGERS911.COM under HOW TO ADOPT . We have an online application that is very easy to fill out.",

Nice to meet ya!  \n\nWATCH MY VIDEO:  https://youtu.be/1tXnnodjV3s\n\nIf you like me, ask my foster for a better video!\n\nA nice person came along and took me in and, now, I am ready to hit the road to your house!  Uh, make that \u201cour\u201d house, OK?  I definitely need a house with a fenced-in yard cuz I need room to run and romp and be safe!  The rescue requires (1) a fenced-in yard and (2) a vet reference from a vet that you have used for a current or previous dog to be sure that all vetting was done.  \n\nI am a Whippet/Terrier mix.  I am 8 MONTHS old and I weigh 25 pounds.  I will probably weight 35 - 40 pounds fully grown. I have been neutered and am up to date on vaccines so I'm ready to go to my new home with YOU!!  Those funny-looking 2-legged creatures said I\u2019m also microchipped \u2013 whatever THAT is.  At any rate, I am fully vetted.  Is that anything close to petted?  I love to be petted!  They say I'm precious.  Hmmm, Is my name Trevor or Precious?\n\nWanna hear some more good stuff about me?  OK, here goes.  I like ALL people and ALL dogs.  I need to have a DOGGIE SIBLING so we can run and romp together and burn up LOTS and LOTS of energy!   If you don't have a doggie sibling, I need someone who can play with me and love on me a w-h-o-l-e lot!  How about all day and evening, every day?  OK?\n\nI have lots to learn.  Will you teach me all the things a pup needs to know to be safe and happy? I LOVE to give kisses so get ready!  \n\nIf you have children, then need to be older children - 12 and up because I like to play hard and run fast!  It's fun!\n\nSince I was rescued, I've learned to use a doggie door at my foster's home.  Smart, huh? I like to take naps when I'm tired from playing.  I need  love, exercise and couch-sitting when we get tired!  Let's be a team, OK?\n\nIf you would like to take me home (and you know you do), please email doggydarlings12@gmail.com  and they can get me on my way to a new and loving home!  Once you adopt me, I will be flown to Seattle from Houston, TX.  (That's the only place we can fly to right now.)  My adoption fee is $450 and includes my vetting, neutering, flight cost, travel crate, Health Certificate and a microchip.\n",

Filling out this form does not obligate you to adopt.\n\nhttps://www.unitedanimalfriends.org/index.php?option=com_rsform&view=rsform&formId=2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet Lady, a beautiful and healthy 35-40 pound, 3 year old Cattle Dog mix. Lady has great energy and will be the perfect mate for an active family who likes to hike, camp, run , walk or just be outside. Lady is smart, very smart! She will be easily trained and will love being part of the family. She gets along great with other dogs in a pack like setting. We will have to do a proper meet and greet with your pet to make sure it's a match. Lady loves women but she can be a little wary of men but does warm up. She loves attention and will be your best buddy. We do not know how she is with children or cats since she has never met any but with calm older children she may be a match.\u00a0\u00a0Lady requires a secure fenced yard.  And, no apartment/condos. \n\n\n\n\nOur adoption fee of $250.00 helps cover expenses (vaccinations, microchips, spay/neuter, food, housing) for the homeless pets we rescue.  UAF does NOT ship or adopt our adoptables out of state (Arizona) and to ensure the best fit, UAF conducts a home visit to meet other pets and verify a safe, secure yard.\n\nTo start the process of adopting this dog or any other dog, please fill out our matchmaking form which can be accessed by copying the following address and pasting it into your browser.  Filling out this form does not obligate you to adopt.\n\nhttps://www.unitedanimalfriends.org/index.php?option=com_rsform&view=rsform&formId=2\n\nPlease email uafdogs@gmail.com to learn more about this dog.",

Clyde isn't an escape instigator but if the opportunity arises he is off!\nClyde is a little less confident and needs time to warm up to those around him. He lived with 11 year olds, chickens (he has to know they are part of the home or he will kill), cats, and livestock.\nIf you have an above ground, secure fenced yard and would like to foster Clyde on his own or with hisfarm-mate Bonnie please fill out an application.

They may subside some as she is allowed to be inside and feels safe.  She lived with 11 year old boys, chickens (she has to know they are part of the home or she will kill), cats, and livestock.  \nIf you have an above ground, secure fenced yard and would like to foster her on her own or with her farm-mate Clyde please fill out an application.  https://www.southcentralbloodhounds.org/adoption-1",

My name is Lloyd, and I am part of the construction trio that came to rescue. I came with my 2 brothers after we were found living in an abandoned house by some construction workers. No one is sure how long we were living there, but it is approximated by a vet that I am 10 months old, and I am all puppy! What does \u201call puppy\u201d mean? I have been in rescue for a couple of weeks now, and I am learning everything about life, but I am going to need a patient person to love me while I learn. I have no manners, so you might need a hard hat to wear while you are teaching me about all the things that I need to learn so that you don\u2019t hurt your head from the potential frustration that might come with this. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, because I am truly amazing, have the sweetest personality, absolutely LOVE people, and I love to play, but there is a lot that I am working on. These are the things that I am working on. I am still potty training, so I need a strict routine that will make sure that I continue learning how to go outside when I need to go. I will go in my kennel when I need to, but I am not a fan of it. I eventually settle down in there, but I want to be there the action is, so we\u2019ve learned that being in my kennel in view of my family is what makes me settle faster. As you might imagine, I have had to learn to find food my entire young life, and so food for me is a great motivator, but it also means that I am very protective of my food because I am still learning that it will always be there, so for now, it is best that I am fed separately from any other dogs that might be in my new home. Due to food being a high value possession for me, bones and treats are something that I only get while in my kennel. It\u2019s being used in a 2-fold manner in the sense that it\u2019s making me realize that my kennel is a great place to be, but it\u2019s also not creating a potential issue if there are other dogs in the home. Did I mention that I love to play? Oh boy! I have energy and love to run and play with my toys and people. I am not aggressive at all, but I am still learning when play time is over or when I need to settle because I am getting a little too excited. Well, there\u2019s where I am in this great big world. I am learning so much, but I still have a ways to go. I know that I am cute and cuddly looking, but I want make sure that you know I am a work in progress. I will get there, but it will take some time, some love, and a whole lot of patience. Up for the challenge?? If so, head on over and fill out my application, and let\u2019s get this party started! Hard hat potentially required, Lloyd. (UPDATED 12/09/20)",

Goldie is a sweet girl that\u2019ll need some work and in return, be your loyal companion.\n Put simply, Goldie is an introverted gal that can be overstimulated easily. Good news: her foster home knows a lot about her and all the ways to make her a happy pup that\u2019s fun to live with.\n She is super smart and highly treat motivated. She enjoys learning new tricks. She does well with other dogs when given a controlled environment like hiking or walking with friends. When off leash, she gets too aroused and it\u2019s a bit frustrating to other dogs. For this reason, Goldie is looking for a home without other dogs or cats, but would do fine with having dog friends on adventures.\n She loves playing fetch with stuffed toys and working on enrichment puzzles. She finds a lot of self soothing in sniffing and gnawing, so she does awesome with \u201cfind it\u201d games outside, licky-mats, and sniffing out food in snuffle mats. She loves chewing on sticks, bully sticks, frozen bone marrow bones, and working on kongs as a nice night-time routine or chill-out activity.\n She\u2019s crate trained, house trained, and knows a lot of tricks - sit, down, shake, etc. She is super smart and eager to learn more.\n Goldie is working on mouthiness when aroused while running in the backyard (already SO much better), counter surfing, and walking well on leash. For this reason, we are recommending kids 12yrs+ and a strong owner for her until she\u2019s a bit more mature and trained.\n She takes 5 mins to settle in her crate at night and then is silent and keeps her crate clean, so we are looking for a living situation without shared walls. Goldie would benefit most from an adventure lifestyle, country living, agility training or a strong running buddy that can exercise her and then veg out at night. Goldie is looking for someone who understands that she\u2019s an adolescent. After all her adventures, she benefits from a nice nook to decompress in. To help her decompress, she likes to take a chamomile + hemp edible, simmer in lavender, chew on a bone or sniff something out, and listen to relaxing music. Can you be that forever home she\u2019s looking for?\n\nApply today at http://www.underdogpetrescue.org/dog-application\n\n**Please note: Our animals live in foster homes throughout the Madison area. We do not have a shelter where animals are available for daily viewing. Applying is the first step in our process.**\n\nDogs from Underdog Pet Rescue come with the following medical care already provided:\nSpay/Neuter\nRabies, Distemper, and Bordetella Vaccinations (as age appropriate-puppy adopters may need to cover some vaccine boosters)\nHeartworm Test (for dogs over 6mo)\nMicrochip\nDeworming\nHeartworm and Flea/Tick Preventative\nAny other necessary medical treatment as recommended by veterinarian\n\nOur adult dog adoption fee is $300. Our puppy (under 5 mo) is $375. Our senior dog (over 8 yrs) is $250.\n\n*Please note that all breeds noted are estimates or best guesses.

My name is Gauge, and I am part of the construction trio that came to rescue. I came with my 2 brothers after we were found living in an abandoned house by some construction workers. No one is sure how long we were living there, but it is approximated by a vet that I am 10 months old, and I am all puppy! What does \u201call puppy\u201d mean? I have been in rescue for a couple of weeks now, and I am learning everything about life, but I am going to need a patient person to love me while I learn. I have no manners, so you might need a hard hat to wear while you are teaching me about all the things that I need to learn so that you don\u2019t hurt your head from the potential frustration that might come with this. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, because I am truly amazing, have the sweetest personality, absolutely LOVE people, and I love to play, but there is a lot that I am working on. These are the things that I am working on. I am still potty training, so I need a strict routine that will make sure that I continue learning how to go outside when I need to go. I will go in my kennel when I need to, but I am not a fan of it. I eventually settle down in there, but I want to be there the action is, so we\u2019ve learned that being in my kennel in view of my family is what makes me settle faster. As you might imagine, I have had to learn to find food my entire young life, and so food for me is a great motivator, but it also means that I am very protective of my food because I am still learning that it will always be there, so for now, it is best that I am fed separately from any other dogs that might be in my new home. Due to food being a high value possession for me, bones and treats are something that I only get while in my kennel. It\u2019s being used in a 2-fold manner in the sense that it\u2019s making me realize that my kennel is a great place to be, but it\u2019s also not creating a potential issue if there are other dogs in the home. Did I mention that I love to play? Oh boy! I have energy and love to run and play with my toys and people. I am not aggressive at all, but I am still learning when play time is over or when I need to settle because I am getting a little too excited. I currently live with my foster sister, and I do great with her even though she doesn\u2019t always want me to play, so I am learning how to take correction. Well, there\u2019s where I am in this great big world. I am learning so much, but I still have a ways to go. I know that I am cute and cuddly looking, but I want make sure that you know I am a work in progress. I will get there, but it will take some time, some love, and a whole lot of patience. Up for the challenge?? If so, head on over and fill out my application, and let\u2019s get this party started! Hard hat potentially required, Gauge. (UPDATED 12/09/20)\n\n",

However, he was in dire need of medical attention for his eyes.  Due to the lack of vet care, he is partially sight impaired.  The medications he is now on will keep him comfortable and stop him from going completely blind. \nHe has an inoperable tumor on his spleen.  However, one would never know it. He loves going for walks, enjoys the company of smaller dogs and would be okay with older, respectful kids ages 11yrs. +.  \nDue to his age and health condition, we are seeking a local foster or forever home as he may have weeks to months to live the best time of his life. \n\nIf interested in fostering, please contact us at 845-986-2473.  We will cover all food and medical expenses for Casper.  \n\nOur adoption policy is to process applications first and then set up individual appointments. \nYou are welcome to download and complete our adoption application from our website at wvhumane.org.  You can either fax it to us at 845-987-8995 or scan and email it back to us. \nOnce processed, we will contact you.\nIf you have any questions, you are welcome to speak with our adoption counselor, Kelly, who can be reached Monday through Friday between 12 and 3 at 845-986-2473. \n",

More importantly, what a good guy at the vet and with everyone he meets! He came from a local animal control facility where we saw him and knew immediately we had to rescue him. Those eyes, that grey face, the love he has to share. We will never know his past but his future looks exciting. #spoiledpup\nHardy has some aging changes in his joints which causes him discomfort at times so he will need to be kept on joint support, pain management, and fish oil to maintain his good looks and great demeanor. \n?Hardy Heart Love, welcome to the world of RESCUE?\n\nFrom his foster family  - We LOVE him, he loves to snuggle, he runs in the yard like a puppy, he is quiet, loving and just a great friend.  He loves his naps, his jogs, his food and his toys.  \nHe has no separation anxiety, no food aggression, knows  no stranger.",

AN APPLICATION IS THE FIRST STEP TO ADOPTION AND WILL BE GIVEN PRIORITY.\n\nIDGSR WELCOMES  NIKON INTO THE SAFETY OF THE RESCUE!!!!\n\nNikon is a handsome male German Shepherd who is approx. 2 yr. old and is  extra-large. He is not overweight, just big and tall. Nikon was found as a stray wandering around a mountainous area alone. He is strong physically and he is strong-willed.  Nikon will need a more advanced owner/handler, someone who is a strong pack leader and can set boundaries for him. Nikon could be in a working home he has a high ball drive that potential search and rescue work or narcotics could be in his future. Nikon did not do well at the vet's office and had to be muzzled. We have started working with him on some basic commands but Nikon will definitely need obedience training. He is friendly to people and he\u2019s fine with female dogs but no male dogs. In the right home with the right owner, Nikon will do very well. \n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Nikon, please apply by\n\nCOPYING AND PASTING THE LINK BELOW FOR THE APPLICATION.\n\nhttps://www.idgsr.org/applications\n\nPlease note that submitting an application and fee does not guarantee that you will be approved or guarantee the adoption of any specific dog, since that dog may have other applications being considered.\n\nAll our adoptable dogs are up to date on vaccinations, heartworm testing, monthly preventative, and have been spayed or neutered.\n\nEveryone must submit an application before an appointment is made to meet the dogs.

I ended up being a very active dog that needs a good bit of training. I also like jumping fences to explore, so I will need a home that can work with me.\n\nI was originally found as a stray in August and was brought to Pet Savers. it looked like I had a pretty rough time while I was on the streets before, but I recovered wonderfully. I am very sweet and would love to meet you!\n\nFee $100If you are interested in adopting, please visit petsaversshreveport.org and find our adoption application under the 'Dogs' tab. Completed applications can be emailed to our Adoption Team at petsavers@petsaversshreveport.org - all adoptions require a vet reference.

She will alarm bark when someone new enters her environment. She is great with people she meets outside of the home, loves walks and cuddles with her person.   She does best in a calm environment so needs an adult only home that does not have too many visitors. She does have some minor leash aggression to other dogs if they get too close but her foster is working on this with her.   Mary will likely do best as an only dog. She does need someone that can work with her on building her confidence so she no longer feels the need to be the protective.\n\nIf you are not ready to adopt just yet and would like to help in other ways, please consider clicking on the green \u201cSponsor Me\u201d button above to help this dog receive the best care we can give. We rely on the generosity of others to make rescuing dogs possible.\n\nIF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING THIS DOG, PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU HAVE READ THE DOG'S INFORMATION CAREFULLY.

We hope to find Mina a family who will fill the time she has left with love and happiness. She will be in our hospice program; she can go to an adoptive home, but her necessary medical expenses will be covered by NMDR. Mina is also heartworm positive and is undergoing treatment. She needs to stay calm.\n\nThe NMDR Rehab Team is working with Mina to help her work through some behavior challenges. She needs a family who will be extra patient with her, and who preferably has previous experience with dogs. The NMDR Behavior Manager will talk to prospective adopters to explain the work we've done with her, and what will be the best home situation for her. \n\nTo submit an application to adopt Mina, visit https://nmdr.org/our-dogs/adopt/\n\nFun Facts about Mina:\nFriendly with people\nLikes other dogs\nDoes great on leash\nSocial butterfly\nEnjoys attention\nLikes to play tug\nLoves belly rubs and snuggling\n\nChallenges for Mina:\nMina has some ear issues that we are treating \nWhile she loves other dogs, her dog play manners are a little rough. If she goes to a home with other dogs, they need be young, healthy, large and very tolerant.\nShe can play a little rough with her human friends, too.\n\nTo submit an application to adopt Mina, visit https://nmdr.org/our-dogs/adopt/",

In the months that he has been with us, Brodie has come a long way in his healing. He is currently blind-but his eyes have been responding to light and shadows. We are not sure what the outcome will be for his vision, but in the meantime this sweet boy is looking for his forever home. \n\nHe will need someone who is willing to help him navigate the outdoors again, though he is perfectly content to be cuddled up in a cozy, warm bed all day!\n\nBrodie has won our hearts here at CVAR and has quickly become the perfect little office dog. This couch potato loves to cuddle and be in the vicinity of people. He would most likely do best in a quiet household where he can feel safe and cozy for his golden years! \n\nIf you are interested in adopting this amazing dog, please fill out an online adoption application on our website: centervalleyanimalrescue.org.",

In true Beagle style, Minka loves to run around the yard trying to get the scent of whatever critter may have run by.  Minka also loves being part of a pack.  She would do best in a house with other dogs.  \nMinka's disability has never slowed her down. She is incredibly active.  She is fostered on a home that has an acre of land and Minka runs every inch of it.  She plays with a 65 lb dogs, runs around the yard with puppies and wrestles with pitbulls.  Minka also loves to cuddle with the small dogs.  She does howl at cats, but overall does well with them.\n\nMinka does have potty accidents, mostly because she can't go outside whenever she needs to use the bathroom.  Diapers don't typically stay on her, and we use a lot of washable pads with her.  She weighs around 25 lbs and is good about being picked up and carried.  \n\nMinka does try to stand and she can move her legs.  She just doesn't have strength.  We have tried hydrotherapy and exercises, and although she has improved a lot, we think she will need a chair for the rest of her life.\n\nWe know it will take a special family to want to adopt a special needs dog.  Minka deserves to find a loving forever home and we just know her perfect family is out there.",
