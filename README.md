# Destiny
Many of us live alone and wander through life. Enter Destiny. Destiny matches you to a pet and a passion to help you devote yourself to caring for another living thing and refine a craft to call your own. Our focus is increasing pet adoption in the California area and swapping idle hands for joyous memories.
