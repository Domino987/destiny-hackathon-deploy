He is a happy guy! We have not cat tested yet. He will be ready for a lifelong home once neutered but applications are accepted now. We have not cat tested yet. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- If interested in meeting and potentially adopting, please read the adoption requirements and complete the adoption application located at forbellessake.org. Once processed and approved a meet and greet can be scheduled and if a match an adoption can be finalized at that time. FBS standard adoption fee is $175. All residents are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, dewormed, microchipped, and treated for any known medical needs. Breeds are best guess. Housetraining is not guaranteed but crate training is worked on with all residents. A secure physically fenced yard is required. See Less\n",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\nHow to perfectly summarize Venus: \"Though she be but little, she is fierce\". Venus originally came to us before Thanksgiving as one of the members of the Sunshine Kids litter. Right off the bat, Venus was special. She was quiet and sweet and always expressed gratitude by giving kisses whenever something was done for her. Beautiful in her own way, Venus was passed over several times before being adopted as she wasn't as blonde as her siblings / she looked \"too different\". Over time, her \"mask\" has faded but she is as beautiful as ever.\n\nVenus was adopted around the same time as her siblings at around 10 weeks old, but was promptly returned for behavioral problems.... none of which she exhibited prior to adoption. With either a few weeks maturity or just a very different environment, she seemed to shift into a dog who resisited handling quite fervently.\n\nAfter confirming that her growling at being picked up was not medically related, we put together a program to help build her trust, solidify fair boundries, and associate restraint and handling with positive things.\n\nVenus has come a very long way since returning to our care. She has learned how to express her boundaries and communicate when she doesn't want to be picked up/held, in a calm voice.\n\nVenus does display affection, but on her own terms. She prefers to climb into your lap or sit next to you vs being picked up or placed where you want her. She does respond to her name, sits when asked, and will come to you when called (most of the time). When she wants to say thank you or just let you know she's happy, she will come up to you and wait for you to lean close so she can steal a kiss. She LOVES to run around in the fenced back yard of her foster home and play with all the toys. Venus does not like to be alone. However, while she likes the company of another dog to play with, she is a bit sassy and bossy. Her ideal playmate is a dog that doesn't mind being told what to do.\n\nVenus would thrive in a home without cats or children, a fenced area to play in, and active loving parents who will continue to work with her, show patience, and reassure her that she is safe and loved. She would love to meet any potential dog siblings before deciding on her forever home.\n\nVenus is a smart girl who is crate trained and ready to continue potty training, learn new tricks, and be a permanent part of a family.\n\nOur first step is an application which can be filled out at: www.cvrrescue.org The adoption fee for this dog is $250.00 which helps to cover a portion of the care provided, including: spay/neuter, microchip, heartworm testing, deworming, age appropriate vaccinations: DHLP/P, Bordetella, Rabies, and any medical care received while with CVRR. All animals are on flea/tick and parasite prevention for the duration of foster care. CVRR is a nonprofit organization, we have no paid staff. Applications are reviewed and processed by our volunteers. Please be patient and understand that it takes an average of 7-14 days to process the applications including reference checks and follow-up questions. You can expedite the process by providing accurate phone and email info for all your references. Once your application is approved, we will schedule a meet-and-greet to see if the dog picks you too. If it seems the adoption will be a good match for all, there is an adoption fee and an adoption contract to be signed. The adoption fee helps to cover a portion of the care provided to the animals. By the time of adoption all dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vetting. CVRR is a NO KILL rescue organization and we have a LIFETIME COMMITMENT to all of our animals. If for any reason the adoption does not work out the animal is to be returned to CVRR. We will re-evaluate and choose a new home based on the best fit for that particular animal. A note about puppies: Adopters can expect a new puppy to have accidents, chew things they shouldn't, and have other normal energetic puppy issues such as jumping, mouthing, and general youthful naughtiness, until they are trained. If you are having puppy issues please feel free to contact us, we are happy to give you guidance. Because this is a mixed breed we cannot guarantee an adult weight. If your residence has weight restrictions or you are looking for an ideal weight we don't recommend applying for this puppy (you can always check out the adult dogs whose weights we do know).",

That was how Charlotte greeted Wilbur in Charlotte's Web, and like that Wilbur, our Wilbur is SOME PIGer, dog! Wilbur is a two year old cutie who has been in a home for the last several months after being found as a stray. According to his former owner, Wilbur has done great with other dogs and has also done fine with young children, generally keeping his distance. Wilbur has been an outside pet, but unlike his porcine namesake who was comfortable in the barnyard, he would prefer a place indoors next to his family in his future home. Wilbur is a timid boy who could use help gaining confidence- a patient, calm home with a confident doggy friend to guide him would be just the ticket! Ask about Wilbur today- we think he's TERRIFIC!",

Strangely, it is probably the best thing that ever happened to him because now he is a PAWS New England dog and our mission is to find him a perfect home.\n\nStax is very gentle, young, with smooth brindle fur, and captivating amber eyes. He is sweet, quiet, crate trained, and plays well with others too! \n\nHis favorite activities with his canine pals are playing chase and wrestling. \n\nStax also loves to cuddle with his people, have his back scratched, and give lots of kisses.\n\nHe is a popular guy so get your application in fast! Stax is ready to rock-n-roll north to his forever home!\n\nCheck out his videos! \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaQaUWUcVpc\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNWmUvwFRzE \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNWmUvwFRzE Stax and Babie\n\n\nName: Stax\nBreed: Plott Hound/Pit Mix\nSex: Male\nAge: 2-3 years of age\nWeight: 60 lbs\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\nVaccinations: Up to date\nHeartworm: Positive, has begun treatment\nMicrochipped: Yes\n\nBASED ON OUR OBSERVATIONS: \nGood with Children: Over 12\nGood with Dogs: Yes\nGood with Cats: Unknown\n\nAdoption Fee: $475.00\n\n\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION:\nInterested in a specific dog, please fill out an application if you are interested in a dog. The number of individual inquiries is overwhelming and we are finding it difficult to respond to each one. We cannot guarantee you will receive a timely response.\n\nPaws New England is a rescue, not a shelter, and as such we do not have our dogs housed in one location - they are in foster homes both in New England and in our southern foster homes. If you're interested in a specific dog, please complete a short online application and you will receive a reply within 48 hours so you can ask questions.\n\nAt present, if a dog is listed on our website, the dog is considered still available HOWEVER, may have applications that have come in before yours but it's still too early to know if any are a good match; therefore we encourage you to apply.\n\n\nNOTICE WITH REGARD TO LOCATION OF DOGS: Please note: Paws New England is a foster-based rescue. We do not have a brick and mortar building to house the dogs we rescue. We have found that dogs in foster homes are much more adoptable because they have been observed in a home setting. Dogs listed with Paws New England typically reside in various locations throughout the south (primarily Tennessee, Texas, and Arkansas) and New England (not necessarily in the state of Rhode Island). You will be notified by the adoption coordinator of the location of the dog you are interested in so you have the ability to decide whether to pursue adoption or not.\n\nDogs transported to New England are done so at a fee of $150.00 paid directly to the transporting company by Paws New England; no additional transport costs are responsibility of adopter. This fee is included in the adoption donation.\n\nAdoption donations cover pre-adoption vet costs (including vaccinations, spay/neuter when age appropriate, and heartworm testing/treatment when necessary), a microchip, and transportation to New England if necessary.\n\nDonations for our young, healthy puppies and dogs support their fellow canines of advanced age or suffering from injuries and abuse whose donations are reduced but whose veterinary costs are typically much higher. We appreciate your understanding that your dog will help others in need.\n\nAll known information about the animal is listed above. We do our best to give accurate information, but most of our dogs are rescues and do not come with a known history.\n\nPaws New England abides by the dog importation regulations set forth in the states of MA, CT, NH and RI.",

That said, she is very loving to her pyrents and there is nothing bad to say about her (except she doesn't like wild turkeys) - only being offered for placement as her elderly pyrents are giving up their ranch and moving to town.\n\nMaisy is up to date on all vaccinations and will be at Old Farm Kennels in Florence, MT either the 16th or 17th of this month.

I'm guessing this is quite cute because I notice my foster mom smiling at me all the time! \nHave you heard of zoomies? Well, I have achieved a gold star for zoomie ability. In fact, I love to run a few laps of zoomies in my fosters fenced yard right before I pick the most perfect spot to complete my outside business. \nClassified as a \"Timeless Treasure .... (aka. Senior) I am proud of my maturity. Free from puppy shenanigans, I am a wonderful companion. Sharing space with my humans is amazing. I love couch time and simply hanging out together in the house. Other dog companions are totally awesome for me too. My foster sister is the best. She was once a homeless pup too. She inspires me everyday to believe that I can have my own family! \nBeing 11, I have experienced a significant amount of life experiences. Some good.... Some I would rather leave in my past. \nI am searching for a home filled with love and kindness. I like a more chill pace to life where I can decide when it's time to run around and be silly. Since I have been let down for so many years, I am initially a bit reserved. Be patient, I will allow you into my world. Be kind, I will work to build new levels of trust. Be ready to offer me a world filled with love, and I will open my heart to you. \nPs. Remember I love rump rubs and to happy prance. \nAlso, consider the world of a difference you could make in my life by choosing to allow me to live the remainder of my days knowing that I am valuable and worthy of being adopted. \n~Love, Mrs. Howell \n\nContact Unleashed if you would like to give this Timeless Treasure a chance for the best future ever.",

He is now in a loving foster home and receiving treatment for heartworm. He is doing great! His foster mom says, \"Bodhi continues to amaze me with his sweet, affectionate nature. This boy is so grateful and will be an amazing family member for someone once he is healthy. He is a cuddly love bug who would do great with a family or person who is around a lot. Bodhi gets along with other dogs but seems to prefer to have all of the attention for himself. He is mellow and probably doesn't need to have a yard to run in. He would likely be happy having leash walks and an occasional off leash romp in the park. Healthwise, Bodhi is currently undergoing treatment for heart worm but should be ready for adoption around April. He is otherwise healthy, has been vaccinated, and will be neutered on February 1.\" The vet believes Bodhi is around four years old.\n\nIf you are interested in giving this sweetheart a home, please contact Ellen at ellenpberrios@gmail.com or 617-905-8694. Bodhi is available for adoption on- and off-island.\n\nIf you don't find the pet you are looking for at Defensa, please consider adopting from another organization helping homeless animals on the island or from one of the high-kill shelters (e.g. Villa Michelle).\n\nThank you for considering adopting a rescued animal. Learn more about what we do and support our efforts to help the street animals of Puerto Rico at\n\nwww.DefensaAnimalDePuertoRico.org",

You can apply for a dog at www.adoggie4you.org. This pup is approximately 6 years old, weighs 13 pounds and is HW Negative. The adoption fee is $300.00\n\nCayden and Clifford came to us from a horrific hoarding case in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas. They were kept in a warehouse with over 100 other dogs, deprived of light, food and interaction. They were a mess when they came to us. They were used to fighting for every bite of food and fighting humans that were abusing them.\n\nCayden and Clifford blossomed under our care. They play with other dogs now and even play with toys. They love the handler's that take care of them and they are no longer terrifed when they are being groomed. Both these dogs have come a long way.\n\nBoth Cayden and Clifford were adopted a year ago by a very nice family. Cayden was returned within a week for trying to bite the husband. We suspect it was because he was wearing a uniform. Clifford lasted four months longer. He was doing great, but he tried to bite the husband and he was returned. He did good with the wife and children. Over the last year they both have really become more social and we want to give them another chance to find a family.\n\nIf you don't have an abundance of patience and the experience to work with a dog that has been mistreated, please don't apply. These boys need an opportunity to shine.",

The only time she might seem a bit bear-ish is when someone tries to take away her rawhide bone, those manners need some work! Otherwise, Layla is a polite older girl, who is potty-trained, walks well on a leash, knows how to sit, and loves to shake hands (especially when she spies some food she wants). She loves kids, but would probably do best in a house with children who are old enough to understand her need for some space and gentleness. She doesn't seem to mind other dogs as long as they follow the not-in-her-face rule. Layla hasn't been observed around cats, but likely wouldn't have the energy to chase them. \n\nLayla is what they call geriatric, and her body fits that description, however, her spirit is younger than her ten years! She does have some health needs including joint pain, a heart murmur, and poor hearing and eyesight, as well as undergoing treatment for heartworms, but she still has so much life left in her! She loves riding in the car, and gets very excited for her brief walks. If you are looking for a quiet couch potato to be your giant teddy bear, we hope you will give this precious girl a chance!",

            "description": "Are you looking for a big fella with an even bigger heart? This gorgeous boy (about 80 lbs.) is looking to become someone\u2019s BFF. Remi is a very affectionate dog that loves being with his people. He\u2019s gentle and loving, a bit of a couch potato, but ready for a long walk or hike when he\u2019s not chillin\u2019. Although he has lived with other dogs, he does best as an only pet. Unfortunately he is not cat friendly. With humans though, he is sweet and gentle and submissive. Remi would do best in an active home where he is an integral part of the family. He\u2019s not a back yard dog in any sense. He has excellent house manners, is never destructive and completely house broken. He walks well on a leash and rides well in a car. In fact, if you like road trips, Remi would be an excellent travel companion. Like camping?  Remi would love to share your tent. If a part adventurer / part couch potato sounds like your kind of dog, please consider adding Remi to your family.  \n\nRemi is neutered, up to date on vaccinations, microchipped, heartworm negative and current on flea/tick medications.  His adoption fee is $200",

If there are multiple applications for a puppy, after all home checks are done, then the puppy is adopted out to the home that is the best fit for that puppy.\n***** All breeds listed are a best guess or based on information from our rescue partners and are not guaranteed*****\n \n ******Chicagoland Dog Rescue reserves the right to restrict adoption of a dog to potential adopters who live within a fifty (50) mile radius of Schaumburg, IL *****\n\nWho has the best ears and the most beautiful eyes and is a total softie on the inside? Me! I am the sweetest and most polite girl you will ever meet. I LOVE every person I meet. I will ALWAYS be excited to see you when you come home, or even back into the room after you\u2019ve left for a while! I am good with kids and I am dog friendly. I am a sweet, playful, and curious pup! My hobbies include belly rubs, back scratches, playing with my ball (and other toys), sniffing and running around in the yard, and going for walks. My foster mom says I am awesome on a leash! Bonus: I am already potty trained and crate trained! I know sit, come, and paw. I am working on down and stay. I bet I will learn them soon because I will do anything for a treat, and I am one smart girl. My foster mom tells me all the time what a good girl I am and how quiet I am- she has never heard me bark! I would love to be a part of your family! If you would like to meet me, please send an email or fill out a pre-adoption application and a CDR volunteer will get back to you just as quick as they can!\nCuddles and kisses-Jolie\n\n\n\n**The ADOPTION FEE for this pet is $450 which includes getting the puppy/dog up to date on rabies, distemper and bordetella vaccines, fecal test and deworming if necessary, heartworm test, spay or neuter (not including pre-surgical bloodwork) and a microchip. Free access to our weekly training classes is also included for the life of the dog, something no other rescue in the area offers.***",

            "description": "Medical Note: I am Ehrlichia positive. Treatment is 28 days of doxcycyline (an inexpensive antibiotic). The adopter is responsible for treatment of the dog. ODHS does not pay for this treatment. I also have a deformity on my front left paw and am missing a couple toes. I went to a vet, received x-rays, and gave me the all clear. I may need amputation later in the future as I get older, but for now it does not bother me.\n\nHi my name is Peggy I am about 2 years old and weigh about 35lbs. I love walks and running in the backyard. I was born with what my foster mom calls a special paw. I don\u2019t have all my toes on my left front leg, but it does not slow me down!\n\nI don't mind being the crate, but my foster mama gives me lost of blankets and some music so I don't feel so alone. I really like to lay on my bed around people. I love company! I have great potty manners. I sit or go to the door if I want out (that might not be to go to the bathroom. I might just want to go outside and see the world!)\n\nI am excited to meet new people, but am a little shy at first. Once I know you, I get excited to see you and my tail won\u2019t stop! I love other dogs and want to go meet everyone on a walk. \n\nI do really well on a leash. My foster mom walks on my right so the leash will not get caught up on my special paw. She also walks in the gravel most of the walk so I can walk in the grass. Walking in the grass helps me be able to walk longer. I can walk on all surfaces, but grass is my favorite. \n\nI learned how to go up and down stairs and now I can\u2019t stop - they are so much fun! I also am working on sitting on command and I am learning fast! I also don\u2019t bug you while you eat I just lay and rest. \n\nI do a nice job staying off of most furniture, but love the human big beds and snuggling up. I correct easily so even if I get up somewhere you don\u2019t want I will learn fast. \n\nI have met a cat. She was mean and tried to swat me and made a horrible hissing sound. I just ignored her and ran away because it was pretty clear she did not want to be friends.,\n\nYou can still come adopt me or even join our foster program to help the humans learn all the awesome things about new dogs like me! Learn more on our website! \n\nHope to see you soon! \n\nWhat breed am I? Mixed mutt! ODHS does not breed label (unless there\u2019s official paperwork), as studies show it is nearly impossible to tell the exact breed of each dog based off of their appearance.\n\nEducational articles:\n3/3/3 Rule;\nhttps://www.rescuedogs101.com/bringing-new-dog-home-3-3-3-rule/?fbclid=IwAR2iv5m7fqk3FieO7LOsstGeGsYYV_F1rJOd1BPxaImofLpcinpYsUbFRWs\n\nAdoption Donations are $250 for an adult, $350 for puppies (a dog under one year of age), and $125 for a senior dog (based on the age of the dog). Adoption donations are to be made via cash, and credit/debit card. There is a $5 fee to run cards.\n\nPlease remember to bring a collar and leash (non-retractable) with you the day of the adoption. Note: Martingale collars and slip leads are strongly recommended.\n\nDue to COVID19, we aren't having as many open, public adoption events.  Current schedule is pre-determined meet and greet appointments are Wednesday evenings and on Saturdays. \nOur adoption center is located at 3602 Lafayette Blvd, Suite 102, Fredericksburg, VA 22408. It's important that you keep an eye on your emails for any changes or updates during the adoption process.\n\nVisit our website for an application to adopt. \nhttps://www.olddominionhumanesociety.org/adoption-application\n\nOld Dominion Humane Society is a volunteer based organization. We are run completely by volunteers, who also have full time jobs, so we appreciate your patience.  Currently, the average timeframe for a response to your application is 1 week.\n\nLike us on Facebook \"Old Dominion Humane Society\"\nand be a part of promoting forever homes for dogs in need.\n#Adopt #Donate #Foster #Volunteer \n\nNote: ODHS only adopts to Virginia and surrounding states (including D.C.). A $50 out of state fee applies.",

I asked him to include a picture of her so yu can see. She says my papa was a rolling stone??  Paw brought us to Marley's World Dog Sanctuary because he needed some puppies to love and we have done a great job of taking care of him. Through all the baths and shots and icky wormer stuff and drives in the car to the vet, we never fussed any more than necessary. We got neutered last week and a couple of us have already been adopted. There is just three of us left and we are so totally ready to have a family of our own. Paw said the hardest part of having us was trying to get a picture that showed our color. If you watch my whole video you will see that sometimes I look red and sometimes chocolate and sometimes a little silver and sometimes shiny jet black.  I can hardly wait to meet you!\nFor more information about me and Marley's World you can go to Marley's World Dog Sanctuary on Facebook, Visit our web page at https://marleyworld.net       Email us at marleysworld@tutanota.com or as a last resort call 870-373-6669.\n",

You can still adopt me, but the cost of the treatment will become your responsibility, ODHS always recommends you contact a vet to price this treatment if you are interested in adopting me beforehand. I am also Ehrlichia positive, which is a tick-borne disease. I will need to be treated with 28 days of doxycycline (an antibiotic).\n\nHi my name is Lemon! I\u2019m 1 year old and 22 lbs! \n\nI just arrived to ODHS but the humans promised to update my bio as they learn more about me! \n\nYou can still come adopt me or even join our foster program to help the humans learn all the awesome things about new dogs like me! Learn more on our website! \n\nHope to see you soon! \n\nWhat breed am I? Mixed mutt! ODHS does not breed label (unless there\u2019s official paperwork), as studies show it is nearly impossible to tell the exact breed of each dog based off of their appearance.\n\nEducational articles:\n3/3/3 Rule;\nhttps://www.rescuedogs101.com/bringing-new-dog-home-3-3-3-rule/?fbclid=IwAR2iv5m7fqk3FieO7LOsstGeGsYYV_F1rJOd1BPxaImofLpcinpYsUbFRWs\n\nAdoption Donations are $250 for an adult, $350 for puppies (a dog under one year of age), and $125 for a senior dog (based on the age of the dog). Adoption donations are to be made via cash, and credit/debit card. There is a $5 fee to run cards.\n\nPlease remember to bring a collar and leash (non-retractable) with you the day of the adoption. Note: Martingale collars and slip leads are strongly recommended.\n\nDue to COVID19, we aren't having as many open, public adoption events.  Current schedule is pre-determined meet and greet appointments are Wednesday evenings and on Saturdays. \nOur adoption center is located at 3602 Lafayette Blvd, Suite 102, Fredericksburg, VA 22408. It's important that you keep an eye on your emails for any changes or updates during the adoption process.\n\nVisit our website for an application to adopt. \nhttps://www.olddominionhumanesociety.org/adoption-application\n\nOld Dominion Humane Society is a volunteer based organization. We are run completely by volunteers, who also have full time jobs, so we appreciate your patience.  Currently, the average timeframe for a response to your application is 1 week.\n\nLike us on Facebook \"Old Dominion Humane Society\"\nand be a part of promoting forever homes for dogs in need.\n#Adopt #Donate #Foster #Volunteer \n\nNote: ODHS only adopts to Virginia and surrounding states (including D.C.). A $50 out of state fee applies.",

I am a little shy, but its going to be short lived.  I just need to get out and experience the world.  A good Samaritan took me and my three littermates in after our mom was run over by a vehicle.  We were only eight weeks old when we lost our mother.  The nice lady did not have permission to have us in her apartment, so she kept us hidden.  She taught us to use potty pads and really spent a lot of time loving us.  After we grew, it was impossible to hide us anymore and she was forced to ask for help.   \n  \nHomeless days are behind us now and I am looking for a new place to call home.  I am looking for an endless supply of fun toys and doggie treats!\n\nI am learning to walk on a leash and its coming right along. \n \nI am neutered, microchipped and up to date on vaccines.\nI\u2019m in Seattle now!",

Percy is doing great with kennel training, house training, and is great on a leash. He has quickly learned to take treats gently and is making great progress at learning to not jump on his people friends. \n\nPercy will thrive best in a home that is fun, happy, and attentive. He will do best in a home that understands the importance of kenneling while alone, especially through the remainder of his puppyhood. Percy has not been observed with children or cats but he is eager to learn and I believe he could do well in any home with proper training and guidance.\n\nPercy's adoption fee is $250, and he is up to date on age appropriate vaccines, dewormed, current on vaccines, heartworm negative, neutered and microchipped. To meet him, just fill out an application at www.pawsitivetailskc.org",

She loves backyard time too (fence required) and knows commands like sit and lay down. Phoenix is dog selective and needs an owner who will be confident and firm with her on walks. Inside the house, she's a total love bug. ** An adopter with breed experience preferred as she is all shepherd!\nWe think this beautiful girl has soooo much potential and she deserves the best family out there! If that's you- please apply at www.pupandcatco.comWe do not have a shelter facility and our pets are housed in foster homes, vet clinics and local boarding facilities.\n\nMany of our adoptable pets attend adoption events each Saturday at Mall of Georgia Petsmart in Buford, Georgia from 11:30-3:00 pm\n\nPlease check with us to find out if a particular pet will be available. Dogs going to adoption event are typically posted on our Facebook page the day prior.\n\nDetails about our adoption procedures can be seen at www.pupandcatco.com.",

She was no longer producing so the breeder let her go (thank goodness). She has very long teats from having multiple litters and they may or may not shrink up. She is urinating blood so we will have our vet test a sample for a possible (likely) UTI. She's heading to our vet the week of 1/11/21 for spaying, vaccinations, heartworm/fecal testing, etc. She is a LOVE BUG!! Seriously... what a doll and total wiggle/excited worm when she sees you!\n\nNOT TAKING APPLICATIONS: We are not taking applications yet. We will post when s(he) is ready for adoption. In the interest of fairness, EARLY application submissions will NOT be considered. Please note we cannot respond to messages/emails, etc., on dogs that are NOT yet available for adoption.

I know my hand signals, am potty trained, crate trained, and love going for car rides. I LOVE kids, but because I'm so high energy, a home with older kids may be best. I get along great with other dogs I meet when I'm out and about. I'm a big time cuddler and will make sure my new family stays well cuddled every day! \n\n********PLEASE READ BELOW PRIOR TO EMAILING IN**********\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog or any other from our rescue, please go to https://www.hobocare.org/adopt to review our home requirements and fill out an application.

Because of my size though I would do best in a home with older children. I love going on walks and that's a good thing because I could use to shed a few pounds! Could you be my new walking buddy? I am told that I am very good on a leash! I am also pretty smart and well behaved -- I already know how to do a perfect sit and will even give you my paw upon request! And to top it all off I am strikingly handsome. I am pretty much the whole package -- handsome and smart. So if you are looking for a really cool dog, make an appointment to see me today. I will be waiting!\n\nIf you would like to meet me,  please go to AlexandriaAnimals.org/Adopt-By-Appointment to get more information and to schedule a time to meet with me either via video call or at the shelter. If you have questions about this process, please email info@alexandriaanimals.org or call 703-746-4774. \n\n* All cats and dogs are spayed/neutered prior to adoption *",

I think my photo shows that Im friendly and unafraid of the camera, but Im worried that Im never going to make it as an Instagram influencer. Hey!I have an idea! Why dont we team up? You can take my photos, and then I can spend my time being sweet and charming. Here are my selling points: Im social. I like to play, and I have a gentle play style with other dogs. Im clearly adorbs. (Are the kids still saying adorbs? Im a few years old, so Im not a puppy anymore.) At fifty pounds, Im not going to fit in your purse or lap, but I can still keep you company if you let me sit beside you. What do you say? Can we be a team?",

While that home was not ultimately a good fit for her, we did learn that Stella was housebroken and dislikes having her tailed pulled by wee young 'uns. Fair enough! While in PACC playgroup, Stella greeted the other dogs appropriately but preferred to spend her time with the handlers. She seemed a little overwhelmed by the antics of the rowdier pups, and is definitely a people- oriented pooch. Stella would prefer a home without very young children. Ask about Stella today!!",

I was bounced around for my whole life and have had approx 3-4 homes. I was given up each time at no fault of my own.  All of my human owners were not settled and I was not a part of their forever plan. Even still I love humans. I love affection and I am a very good natured and have a sweet temperament. \n\nI am good with dogs who like to play and who are also behaved. I am sort of a parrot. I am fresh with fresh dogs , good with good dogs, and submissive with submissive /laid back dogs. I would love a doggy friend to play with. I like to play, and have a up beat play style. \n\nI like laid back, submissive, sweet dogs. I tire out quick and would prefer someone who likes to play but isn\u2019t hyper. Hyper or rowdy would be too much for me and work me up!\n\nI have never met kids but I most likely would be good with older kids and teens. I am not aggressive in any way but am excited when I am doing something new. So older kids are probably better for me. We would have to see with your kids !\n\nI don\u2019t like cats so I can\u2019t live with cats.\n\nI am spayed, microchipped and up to date on vaccines. I am totally healthy and have no health concerns at my young age of 7. \n\nAs a pre senior I want someone who is dedicated to loving me through my life and who will be invested in caring for me through my later years.\n\nTo apply to adopt fill out our app https://www.secondchanceranchrescue.com/apply-to-adopt",

            "description": "Lucca was a holiday surprise that was born into rescue after his Mama was saved from a euthanasia list in Texas. His mom is a gorgeous, full golden retriever who had a little oopsie with an unknown Texas fella. So far, little Lucca has jet black, thick, soft fur with dots of white on his paws, chin, and chest. Lucca is a stout little guy, weighing in at 5 lbs at just three weeks old (!) so we anticipate him being a big boy when he's full grown. Lucca is learning about life as a happy, healthy puppy and getting lots of snuggles with his foster family. *Please note - As an only pup, Lucca's ideal home will be a multi-dog household. This will help Lucca to learn important socialization skills that he would otherwise be learning through interactions with littermates.\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Lucca is $450. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes. \n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver. \n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months. \n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

I am looking for my special someone to let me cuddle with them and watch Netflix during this next phase of the pandemic! I am a mature boy so I do all of my \" \"business\" outside, love walks, eating my meals and treats, but most of all I love to spend time with humans. I come when called, have learned sit, wait for my turn to eat and wait patiently at the door to go out. I will either sleep in MY bed or will gladly sleep with you in yours.\n\nI have heartworm so my rescue group has been kind enough to pay for my treatment at the vet. I am done with the first phase of the antibiotics and will be starting one shot on January 21 with 2 more at the end of February. I heard it is tough on a guy like me, I will probably want to sleep alot and just go outside to go to the bathroom. It's not hard to keep a couch potato like me quiet, though, so that is good news!\n\nIf you have a home with no other dogs living there, to steal my thunder ( or food) would you consider fostering me and then adopting me when my treatment is done? I promise to love you SO much!",

My name is Honey! I am an older gal 8 years young, but I still have lots of spunk and love to give! I have been with my foster family for a few weeks now, and living the good life. I have a foster brother to keep me company, and I have found that I do well with mellow male dogs. I have some health issues, so my new family will need to be aware of those, but my foster family has worked through them with the vet already!\n\nI love my foster family, but it is time to find a family of my own! I am very vocal at meal time, and I will let you know not to forget my meal. I just love to get my food! I make some silly noises trying to get your attention so you'll feed me. My foster parents say I'm very smart and know sit, down, shake, wait, and crate. I am very loving and affectionate, and I can't wait to find my forever family! If I sound like your type of girl, please fill out an application today.\n\nhttp://Bit.ly/WHBRadopt\n\nwww.Wigglinhomeboxerrescue.org\nEmail: wigglinhomeboxerrescue@gmail.com\nPhone (360) 723-0219",

Wylie has a shorter coat and a sweet face of black and tan. Wylie came accompanied by her puppy Beckett (who has been adopted) The girls were rescued from a 20 dog hoarding home. They came to us with 3 other dogs. Maya and Wylie have been slowly been coming around, will eat out of my hand and are seeking out attention now. We want the girls to have a yard since they are not yet leash trained and this will help them go potty safely as they become accustomed to leads and harnesses.\n\nBoth girls needs an adult only home with people who have the time, commitment, and EXPERIENCE with shy dogs or rescued dogs. a yard and time to spend with dogs. They will do wonderfully from with a work from home, retired, or home most of the time couple. They need a child-free home as they are not accustomed to children\n\nBoth girls are just so sweet and just want to be someone's lapdog and will be very loving dogs with Time, Patience, and Love. Maya and Wylie have been transitioned to Raw and Human grade dog foods. The owner must commit to staying with this high-quality diet. Rompin Paws will educate the adopters in species-specific feeding and care\n\nPLEASE do not write and ask if these dogs are available.\n\nIf they are listed, they are available. We are 1.25 people who are volunteers and we work 20 hour days and have dozens of applications to review on top of the hundred other things necessary to run a rescue and adoption operation.\nTo fill out an application to adopt Please use this link, You will need a computer to complete as cell phones will drop the application\n\nhttp://rompinpawsrescue.rescuegroups.org/forms/\n\nThe site will ask you to create a password and will send you an email. For ease of use, just use the password they create for you and save that password. This will ensure you have access and can fill out the application.",

            "description": "Tuxedo is a one and a half year old spitz mix. He currently weighs 19 lbs and is working on gaining a couple more. Tuxedo is shy (at first), but loves fiercely. He is a perfect work from home companion. He loves nothing more than to relax in a room with his humans and getting an occasional head scratch. Because he loves his humans so much, he has some separation anxiety when they leave. Tuxedo has been working on building his confidence to overcome this. He has already improved by leaps and bounds because he is so eager to please. Tuxedo would benefit from someone that is willing to continue to train and work on his confidence. He is potty trained. He does not like being in a crate but can be enticed into one with a kong toy full of tasty treats. Tuxedo is learning how to have fun with dog toys and his other dog playmates. Tuxedo has also been great living with a small child. He also is a great walking buddy and gets so excited when he sees his leash.\n\nPLEASE READ: Please read all information about this pet provided below.

I can be a lot to handle on leash if I haven't gotten a lot of play time that day. A fenced in yard where I can run and play would be best for me. My dream home would be a place that has lots of room indoors for me to take naps, and lots of room outdoors as well for running and jumping around! In terms of other pets, I seem to be friendly with other dogs, but can become frustrated when I cant get to them. It is unknown how I do with cats or small kids. Bring in your older,  10 years old and up, respectful children for a meet and greet. I can be jumpy at times, so keep that in mind if you have small humans at your house all the time or just as visitors. If I was on a dating app, my pick-up line would be \"you throw, I catch\". Do you like it? Will you give me a try? \n\nSUBMIT AN APPLICATION HERE: https://www.baltimorecountymd.gov/departments/animalservices/adoption-resources.html\n\nFrom a volunteer\nThis is 6 yo Alpine aka Mr Pibbs who came in as a stray. He was confused and very timid at first being in the shelter and didn't present well. However volunteers took him under their wings, and started working with him daily. He's very intelligent and likes challenges like food puzzles and obedience training.\nHe's a handsome Lab mix just waiting for a forever home, with a big fenced yard for playing ball. He has medium energy and loves activity with his people. He went on a day trip to the park, and was well behaved in the car and walking at the park.",

Lucy is about 3 years old and weighs 35-40 pounds.  Lucy is not overly energetic but healthy and properly vetted.  With proper introduction she could be good with dogs her size.

I am a very sweet lady who walks nicely on a leash. I take treats gently and know how to sit. Cheese is my all time favorite snack! *Please apply on our website at indy.gov/activity/adopt-a-pet. Go to the website, click on the adoption application link, enter the information and hit submit. After the application is submitted a staff member will contact you within 48 hours.

He is a 2 year old 20 lb Rat Terrier mix. \nNew Orleans, LA\n\nLeopold is a sweet boy who was turned into the shelter as a stray. The shelter thinks he was hit by a car but he suffered no real injuries, he just had a wound on his arm that is healed now. \n\nLeo is a calm, shy boy with lots of love to give. He needs a patient home who can house train him and work on building his confidence. Hes not skittish but you can tell hes been abused in his past. He doesn't seem to know how to play much but he has his own version of playing that tells me he's happy. \n\nHe's a quirky, fun little boy who is sure to find his match soon. He's good with other dogs as long as they aren't too intimidating to him. Hes sensitive, so a large dog who wants to play might scare him, but hes perfectly fine with other dogs who mostly mind their business. He needs a home without cats or kids. He is kennel trained, neutered, and heartworm negative. \n\nApply to adopt at: \nhttps://form.jotform.com/92846379021159",

So it's best if she is your one and only. This yellow lab mix is about 7 years old. She is a couch cuddler, think she is a lap dog (at 55 pounds), is well mannered in the house and loves to play so a fenced yard would be ideal. She is fine being walked by other dogs. No small kids, teens fine. Mature household best. Ask for more pics. Pls apply on www.crisisdogsnc.org Vet reference and virtual home visit required. We will transport.

NOTE: THIS IS A COURTESY POSTING ONLY! THIS DOG IS NOT AVAILABLE THROUGH BROTHER WOLF ANIMAL RESCUE. \n\nGreat Natured, Needs Urgent Re Homing\nThree old Griffin is one of the best natured dogs we've ever rescued,: trusting, smart, playful, loves everyone , great with dogs (not cats) His foster says,'Griffin is a lovable lug with a constant smile on his face.' This 68 pound pup is a great companion for an active household, but he must have a high secure yard since he will jump a 4 foot fence. Teens fine but no small kids who can leave the door open since he will bolt...the hound in him. He would enjoy a resident dog buddy. Griffin is heartworm positive and has begun treatment. We are paying for treatment, no longer a deal breaker and easily cured. Pls apply on www.CrisisdogsNC.org Vet Reference and virtual home visit required. We will transport in NC where he will get his 3 heartworm treatment shots. This is a wonderful dog! No calls we reply fast to applications.",

He has jumped over fences to race off following his nose so a secure yard will be a must. He also can open latches if they are the right kind. Because he is a hound, he needs some help on his house manners. Anyone who knows hounds, know that they DO get it, it just takes time, patience and persistence. The pay off would be lots of cuddles and a happy smile added to the family. Cruz may need to meet your dog before you decide to love him forever.

            "description": "Elodie is a 2 year old Boxer/Hound mix looking for her forever home.  She is about 60 pounds,  Elodie is sweet, playful, and loving. She would love a home with kids ( 8 and up) to play with and people that will walk her and snuggle with her.  She is a little shy of men, but does warm up after a bit. Another dog in the home may help her gain confidence with men . And she would really love another dog in a fenced in yard to romp with. If you are interested in learning more about Elodie, please complete an application and then reach out to Jen.Lu@bigfluffydogs.com\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please apply online, at https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/. \n\nOur main website, www.bigfluffydogs.com has more information about us and the rescue process. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters should understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. Homes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for 1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (i.e. a 4-month-old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break). 2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise. 3.) Socialization.  The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home. 4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded ten-fold, for years to come.  Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy.  Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time-consuming and can be expensive. All dogs require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well-socialized dog is more than worth the effort to get them there.",

According to the people who brought her to the shelter, she lived her life tied up outside and she was left abandoned at her residence when her owners moved.  \n\nAbbi is a 4 year old Rottweiler (possible Rottweiler mix), weighing about 70 lbs.  Abbi is petite, but strong and loves, loves, loves to snuggle. She likes to jump up on the couch next to you and lay right across your lap, getting as much human contact and love as possible.\n\nAbbi is housebroken, she does fine in a crate if you aren't at home, but she also does fine left unattended in the house while we are away.  She sleeps on a dog bed at night, she rides well in a car and does great at the vet. She gets along well with her very passive male Lab/Golden foster brother.\n\nShe is learning her leash manners, she is doing well but sometimes does pull. She is a bit of a work in progress because she gets so excited to go for walks. When excited she can be mouthy and jump up but does not bite. \n\nAbbi is kind of a spaz when she plays with toys.  She never had them before in her life so it is understandable, and pretty adorable. She can be a bit growly if you try and take a toy away from her, she doesn't want to stop playing!  She has been learning about trading toys for high value treats.\n\nAbbi does have a high prey drive, a home free of cats and small dogs/animals would be best.\n\nAbbi would love to find a forever home with people who love to go on walks, who will give her plenty of toys that she can toss up in the air and run around with and who will allow her to snuggle up to them as much as possible.\n\n\nIf you're interested in meeting Abbi or in learning more about her, please contact Golden Bond Rescue at info@goldenbondrescue.com.\n\nAdoption Fee: $500 + $35 microchip fee\n \n\n* * * * * * * * * *\nEvie is being fostered in West Linn, Oregon\n\nPACIFIC NORTHWEST APPLICANTS ONLY: Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Northern California and Southern British Columbia.

She will need a fence that is hard to climb (as she is a climber). If you would like to learn more about Julie, please complete an application and then reach out to Mandy@bigfluffydogs.com \n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please apply online, at https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/. \n\nOur main website, www.bigfluffydogs.com has more information about us and the rescue process. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters should understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. Homes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for 1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (i.e. a 4-month-old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break). 2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise. 3.) Socialization.  The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home. 4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded ten-fold, for years to come.  Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy.  Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time-consuming and can be expensive. All dogs require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well-socialized dog is more than worth the effort to get them there.",

He is very cautious with new people and new surroundings. With patience and training we know Zigi will be a great companion to a person that has experience with insecure dogs.\n Zigi's insecurities can come of as fear aggression. The ideal home for Zigi would be a calm single family home with no small children under 15yrs old with no other dogs. Cats are ok. To ensure Zigi is comfortable with his new family member he does require multiple visits before finalizing the adoption.  \nNo out of state adoptions for Zigi.\n\n\nFor more information on Zigi, call AWS at 860-354-1350 email animalwelfare.socty@snet.net or visit our website aws-shelter.org for a pre adopt application. Adoption fees for Dogs (8yrs and up) is $150  Adult Dogs is $350 and Puppies under a year is $450.",

But 2020 struck again, and now she\u2019s living the good life in the Big Easy with another foster puppy who is her best friend and wrestling partner. She idolizes the adult dog she\u2019s living with and gets along great with the two resident cats. \nShe was born in late October 2020, she\u2019s UTD on vaccines and is microchipped. She\u2019ll be a large girl when full grown. She\u2019d be great in a home with other dogs and/or children or with someone who is active. \nShe loves to play chase and run around, and then nap for a few hours. She sleeps through the night, gated in a room with her foster sister. \nShe knows sit really well and we are working on potty training. This little star is hours of entertainment and is looking for a permanent gig with her forever family!\n\nPlease note: as with most rescue puppies, we have no way to guarantee this puppy\u2019s breed or size potential. \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq",

He is tolerant of older children and small dogs, but no large male dogs, please.  Hercules is a bit shy when being touched by people and will sometimes pancake down.\n\nHercules needs a committed family that will take their time and have patience with this boy, to show him what being part of a household really means for a Doberman.  \n\nA $300 adoption fee applies.",

            "description": "Meet Stanley. He is a 95 pound Black and Tan coonhound. He is 7 years old. Stanley does need to lose some weight so he is on a diet. \n\nStanley would do best as an only pet. He definitely cannot live with cats, small mammals, or dogs under 30 pounds. Being a hound he has a high prey drive. He also can be protective of his toys with other dogs.\n\nStanley loves people! He is all about his family. He has been around kids, but would recommend older kids due to his hunting instincts. He has never shown any aggression towards people. \n\nWe are working on some manners with Stanley. He does have a very bad habit of counter surfing which we are trying to break. He pulls on leash, but does well with a no pull harness. He is crated when we are not home. He is not a fan, but will go in with some prodding. At night he sleeps in a dog bed in the bedroom.\n\nStanley does well in the car. He rides well in the back seat. We do have to help him into the car. \nStanley is a great dog, but needs the right home. If you would like to meet this dog please call Annie at 815-685-0746.  The adoption fee is $225.\n\nAdoption fee includes:\n- microchip\n- spay/neuter\n- age appropriate vaccinations:  Bordetella, DH(L)PP, rabies\n- heartworm preventive & flea/tick preventive \n- deworming",

Other dogs are okay with a proper introduction, but I am a little protective of my toys, so may do best as an only dog in the home. Some of my favorite things are: being around my people, going for walks, playing outside in the yard, and taking car rides. I do alright with kids and new people, as long as they respect my space and take things slow at first. Positive reinforcement, patience, and love will go a long way with me. One interesting fact is I occasionally have seizures, usually brought on by stress, so a quieter home would be best. \nIf you are interested in being my forever friend, please apply at: AHeinz57.com",

Whether you like lounging on the couch or going for runs, he will happily be by your side. He even knows some basic commands! \n\nDuke came to Lollypop Farm due to not getting along well with other dogs. Since Duke has been with us, we have noticed that he can by shy at first but warms up quickly. From day one, Duke was stressed by being in a kennel so we enlisted the help from one of our wonderful foster parents to take him in while he awaits being adopted. \n\nThe recommendations for Duke's success is a home that has kids over the age of 12 due to some handling sensitivities. He must also be the only pet in the home as he has a history of not liking other dogs or small animals.\n\nIf you would like to know more about Duke or to set up an appointment, email Hannah at hhecht@lollypop.org!",

He is not good with cats and other small animals, and needs to be the only dog in the house. Unfortunately at this time we are needing to rehome him. We\u2019ve had him for about 5 months and the other dogs in the house and him are not getting along and it\u2019s become a stressful environment for him. Dexter deserves a good and loving home where he can be the center of attention. He\u2019s been very good with emotional support and can make an excellent companion for one person or for a couple. \n\nHe\u2019s current on all vaccines, and was adopted from Nevada Humane Society. The shelter is our last choice for him as he has been returned several times for not being in the perfect home environment that he needs. They\u2019re very vague on describing exactly where he needs to be placed. Please contact me for more information.",

My name is Belle. I'm one stout and round gal that is looking for my forever loving home today! I kind of look like a potato with legs right now or as others call me, a pittopotamus. I might be a bit big, but that just means there more to me to love. I'd love to find a loving family that will help me get down to my healthy weight by taking me on walks and engaging in play with me every single day. I don't seem to enjoy being around other dogs for now, but I loooove to snuggle with my humans, play with toys, and go for walks. I'm an extremely nice, loving, and happy dog that just can't wait to go home with you today! Primary Color: Grey Secondary Color: White Weight: 69.2lbs Age: 6yrs 0mths 3wks Animal has been Spayed",

            "description": "This strikingly beautiful girl is Lucy!  We believe her breed to be Rat Terrier (possibly Australian Shepherd mix) born 04/08/2020.  In her previous young life, Lucy had been in a sad situation that led her to come into rescue extremely underweight.  These pictures are deceiving, in that they make her look much bigger than she really is.  Lucy is a very sturdy dog in a small dog body.  Currently she is 16 pounds and will probably, at her ideal adult weight, be about 18 pounds.  With her still being considered a puppy, we would like to find a home for her where there is someone home with her most of the time who will put her on a schedule and work with her.  She would do well with children at least 14 years and up.  We will also require that her new owner will enroll her in training classes.  Lucy is very energetic and is a hard, roughhousing player with the other foster dogs, of all sizes, in her temporary foster home.  She would love another dog in her new home to play with.  She loves to play ball and enjoys a good game of tug of war with the other fosters.  A fenced yard would be a plus!  Her adoption fee includes a crate, training literature, toys, collar, leash and name tag. If interested in Lucy, please call 248.344.0181 (no emails!) and leave a message...if we are not able to answer at that time. If the dog you are inquiring about is still available, your call will be returned. Thanks so much!",

The FRGSR volunteers are working with me on my interactions with other dogs as it appears that I may not have been properly socialized in my younger days. I can be mouthy when redirected. I do like to play ball and go for long walks. I will need a GSD experienced adopter who will provide me with calm, consistent leadership and direction. I may do best as an only dog. If you are interested, please submit an online application at adoptagsd.org.

I didn't look like I'd been on the streets for long, but nobody came to claim me, so the shelter asked FRGSR if they could help me find a new home. I recently arrived, and the FRGSR volunteers are getting to know me. I love to run and play and my recall is great! Most people melt when they see how cute I am! I seem to be very friendly with other dogs too. I am able to climb chain link fences, so I'll need a yard with secure fencing. More info to come. If you are interested, please submit an online application at adoptagsd.org. My adoption fee is $350.\n\nAlthough we do our best to keep our adoptable animals page as current as possible,the animals you see may already be in an adoption process.",

She is full of joy and energy and is VERY food motivated. Drucilla is experiencing the world for the first time, learning how to play, how to walk on a leash, and how to snuggle. She loves her people and is getting braver every day.\n\nDrucilla needs an experienced dog owner who will commit to further training and is ready to provide her with all the love and guidance she so craves. She is not in the main dogroom and will require an appointment to meet. If you are interested in Drucilla please submit an application to begin that process!",

They listed him as a Rottweiler mix based but we really don't know what breed he is.  They asked us to take him because he was completely shut down in his run and wouldn't lift his head or even look at anyone.  We didn't want him to die there so we went and picked him up.  We are so glad we did.  \n\nHe is a very friendly, calm dog.  He is very shy at first, but once he's comfortable in a new home his personality really starts to shine.  He loves all people and seems to get along with all dogs.  We don't know about cats.  \n\nMo enjoys hanging out with his family and will lie quietly chewing a bone or a toy.  He loves the company of other dogs, both male and female.  He plays a little, but isn't energetic enough to play much.  He struggles a little with stairs, so he'd do best in a home without stairs or with very few.\n\nMo is currently going through heartworm treatment and will be finished in mid-February.  He will be ready for adoption at that time.\n\nMo is housebroken and very well crate trained.  He has been fully vaccinated, neutered and microchipped.  His adoption fee is $250.",

She has suffered - so she needs lots of love and good food!!\n\nShe doesn't trust bigger dogs - she must have had an altercation with on during her previous life on the streets - but with love and patience, we think she could overcome it since she is so young and loving.\n\nShe loves to walk and snuggle.\n\nShe knows how to stand up for herself, but luckily in her new life she won't have to.\n\nShe's a survivor, and it shows in her personality. This girl will need some TLC.\n\nFor more info on how to apply to adopt Sweety, please email:\n\nrescue@mayte.com\n\nmichael@maytesrescue.com",

He loves to play with ice.  Good with other dogs and he'd love to have a dog brother or sister.  Sister would be preferred :)   No kitties for this boy though.   Crate trained.   He is a little mouthy  (when playing he uses his mouth like other dogs play with each other) so the children in the home should be teens or older.\n\n\nAdoption fee for all dogs and puppies is $130.00 each, which includes spay/neuter, vaccinations (including all puppy boosters for puppies under 4 months), worming, flea/tick treatment if needed, microchip and collar/leash/tags.\n\n\nPlease email us directly for a faster response and we will send you our questionnaire.   info@petsandpeople.com   We get many each day so please watch your spam/trash folders for our replies.\n\nAdoption fee for all dogs and puppies is $130.00 each, which includes spay/neuter, vaccinations (including all puppy boosters for puppies under 4 months), worming, flea/tick treatment if needed, microchip and collar/leash/tags.",

She is definitely nervous but is settling in. We are starting to see her personality. She loves to play with the tennis ball and she loves to cuddle with us on the couch. She had a couple accidents that we think were from nerves, but is otherwise housebroken. She knows sit, stay, paw, and no. Princess seems to have a high prey drive, she wants to chase all the bunnies and squirrels, so we are not sure she would do well with cats.\n\nWe are working to get her to walk better on a leash, she is controllable but walks very fast. She sleeps well and waits for us to get up in the morning. She definitely has some separation anxiety, as she follows us everywhere, but she did okay in the crate when we left. She went right in, it just took her a bit to settle (we left our blink camera out to keep an eye on her). \n\nShe loves to run and play fetch, she will do best with a secure, fenced yard. Altogether she is a really good dog! A couple of things to work on but she will make a great companion.\"\n\nFOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS TO BE CONSIDERED: \n\nTo adopt, complete the application at tarnj.org/adopt\n\nIf you have any questions at all, please DO NOT use the PetFinder inquiry form as we do not respond to those. Questions should be sent to info@tarnj.org. \n\nAn application is required before any meets are scheduled so the best way to be considered is to apply ASAP at tarnj.org/adopt.\n\nWe are all volunteer-run and do our best to respond to every application. If there is a match with your application, you should hear from us within 2-5 days. If you do not hear from us, please check your Junk folder or email us for an update.",

            "description": "Hi, my name is Cash. I am an approximately 5 year old male staffordshire pit bull terrier mix that weighs around 63 lbs. I am neutered and up to date on vaccinations, microchipped, and heartworm negative. They don't know a lot about my past, but I lived outside my whole life on a run. I had a family before but my little human brother was diagnosed with cancer and I was no longer able to live with them anymore. My foster parents knew my previous family and they couldn't stand to see me go to a shelter, so they brought me to their house to find a new family to love me forever. Since then, I have discovered there is nowhere I'd rather be than in the laps of my foster parents getting cuddles and snoozin the afternoon away! I have also learned many new tricks like sit, place, stay, down, and paw. I love tiny humans and am very gentle with them, but they tell me I'd do best as an only dog as I tend to be somewhat dog selective. Despite this, I could probably pair well with a non-dominant dog with a proper introduction. I will need an adopter who is willing to be patient with me, as when I get nervous or scared sometimes I have accidents inside, but I am a quick learner and always aim to please. Thanks to many unfortunate changes in my environment, I can be a little anxious sometimes and cry because a lot of change can be scary, but with the right family who will work with me and teach me how to be an inside dog, I will relax and settle in quickly. I am crate trained and house trained, aside from my occasional accident when anxious. My ideal family is one that will not give up when I don't understand and that will be patient with me, maybe someone with kids that want someone to play and cuddle with me. I have a few quirks, but I'm a giant goofball who loves to \"\"tap\"\" dance when I'm happy and chew on bones. If you look past my breed's bad wrap and give me a chance I'll be the perfect addition to ant home. Don't you want me in your family?\n\nIf you are interested in giving Cash a forever home, please visit the link below to fill out an application! http://fureverafterrescue.org/adoption-application.html It is best to submit an application through a computer.

This brother and sister duo were adopted together at 8 weeks old to a wonderful family and we\u2019re living their lives when their world crumbled around them .  Their forever family had no choice but to return them to rescue.  They are both perfectly socialized, friendly and walk on the same leash that splits at the end.  Roman is 60 pounds and Gracie is 40 pounds. Both are spay/neutered and are litter mates. That being said Roman and Gracie are a bonded pair. They are about to be 6 years young. They are fully vetted, on flea and heartworm prevention. House and crate trained, walk wonderfully on a leash. What they are looking for is Someone  who is home a lot, who can take them for long leasurely walks. Rides in the car, and a quiet place to spend the rest of their lives. They were raised with older children. No cats or livestock. To make the dream team yours apply at www.brantleyanimalrescuecoalition.com",

            "description": "\nHi, my name Betty Jo. I recently came into VIP Rescue and I am looking for my new home soon! I am very smart and I love to be outside. I a, thought to be a street dog, my rescuers think I have never had an indoor home. Now that I know what this is I love it. I recently learned how to walk on a leash, and I love that too. I prefer to do by business on the leash. I love to explore my fenced backyard.\n\nI am potty trained, I need my new home to offer lots of love and patience. I prefer a home with a fenced yard, as I mentioned I love to be outside. I\u2019m good with other dogs, I\u2019m not picky about age or size. If I had a furry sibling that would probably be good thing I like to play with my foster brother, although he isn\u2019t much interested in me. I am not cat tested, however I do have a prey drive, and love to look for squirrels and birds while I\u2019m on my leash walks. And if given the chance I will chase them.\n\nI am eagerly looking for my perfect forever person or family to call my very own! A meet and greet will be required.\n\nBetty Jo is thought to be approximately 3 years old and weighs 17 lbs. I am most likely a terrier mix. I am spayed, current on my shots, microchipped, and on flea and heartworm prevention. I am heartworm positive. This means I have to take things easy for a while. I also must go see my doctor to get treatments\u2026. so you have to be available to take me to these date sensitive appointments in Palm Harbor. My new family must be in Pinellas, West Pasco or NW Hillsborough. We are accepting applications from experienced pet parents with a fenced yard. Please submit your application to VIPRescue.org. And please share this post to help Betty Jo find her forever home.\n\n\n\nIf you would like to know more about this dog, please complete an adoption application so that our volunteers  may contact you.    To do so, go to our web site:  http://viprescue.org/jobs/apply/?j=772\n\nAll of our available dogs for adoption are are on our website at:  \nhttp://viprescue.org/available-for-adoption/\n\nCheck us out on FACEBOOK and learn more about our adoptions and current events:   \n https://www.facebook.com/VIPRESCUEFLORIDA/\n\nTHANK YOU for thinking Rescue,\nVIP RESCUE OF FLORIDA\n\n",

            "description": "Hi there!  My name is Sebastian! I am a Labrador Retriever and I am 7 years old and I weigh 70 pounds!\n\nI was part of a group of dogs that a rescue started helping in a bad part of town. Rescues had come in and picked all the youngsters and left me and an older lady doggie friend all by ourselves on the street. Finally, after a lot of networking, a rescue heard we were still there and came to get us. I hopped right in her car but my friend, well, she had to get fancy and corner in someone's yard! I was SO friendly, I was trying to help our rescuer get my buddy the whole time! Didn't she know a good person when she saw one???\n\nI had called shotgun in the car and was immediately our rescuer's best bud. I kept popping her hand off the shift to stick my head under it so she could pet me better. I'm very considerate that way and still do that whenever I'm sitting next to someone and I think they've forgotten how to pet me. They got me neutered, up to date on shots, current on heartworm/flea prevention and microchipped. Unfortunately, after a long time of being on the street with no one to take care of me, I was heartworm positive but I have already been through treatment and am raring to go....to my new home with YOU, of course!  I would make you proud to be my parent!\n\nI really love all people....little ones, big ones, tall ones and short ones, young ones and old ones..... it doesn't make any difference to me! I would love a home with just about anyone who would show me affection even if they've got kids or grandkids running around. I'm a little bit older boy so I don't need quite as much action as some of those youngsters out there but I still like to go for a walk down the road with my foster mom and I get super excited when I see people! I would probably do best in a home as an ONLY DOG or maybe just with a SUBMISSIVE FEMALE. My foster mom is still working with me all the time to make me the best boy I can be!\n\nI am still located in Houston, Texas but am super excited to find my forever home and get transported to your area! Will you be my family? I promise you won't regret it.  I will be your best friend for a long, long time!  If you would adopt me, my adoption fee is $450 and that covers my flight to Seattle (only availability during COVID-19), my vetting, microchip, travel crate, cost of the flight and a Health Certificate needed in order to travel out of state.  See?  I'm a real bargain!!!  So, if you live anywhere around Seattle or within driving distance, please email doggydarlings12@gmail.com and you will make me a very happy boy!\n",

            "description": "Samson is a gorgeous fawn-colored boy with a sweet disposition. He's estimated to be around 2 years old and still has quite a bit of that playful puppy in him, but it's definitely manageable as he is well behaved and easily corrected. This big boy (about 65 pounds), will need a home that is somewhat active, has a fenced yard for his playtime and he needs to be an only dog. He also must go to a home that has no cats ... he's not a fan. \n\nSamson does great on leash and presently walks the neighborhood every day in his foster home. His only issue with walking is he does not care for other dogs, so he barks when he sees one. He is corrected by simply turning in another direction away from the on-coming intruder. After a walk, he's all about snuggling ... in your lap, if you will allow! Well, what dog doesn't think they will fit in your lap?! He loves all people, young and old, big and small and on his walks when kids see him and want to pet, that's just fine with Samson. With all of this said, Samson gets to go to Hound Lounge every week to play and he does just fine there with other dogs, so his barking at other dogs when walking might be a \"\"being protective of his human\"\" thing and with some training, this may be something that can be corrected. \n\nSamson came into our program when he and another dog, possibly Samson's mother, were dumped near PInnacle Mountain State Park, west of Little Rock. Once at the vet's office, it was discovered he had several things going on, mostly parasites, but he did have a light care of the dreaded heartworms. His rescuers took care of all of his vetting (shots, neuter, microchip) and he is now 100% up to date and heartworm free! \n\nSamson is a polite dog and a calm dog. He is excellent in the house, never bothering a thing inside. Samson's foster mom is quite petite and she handles him beautifully. Samson is also good in the car and great at the vet. He is housetrained and kennel trained too! HIs adoption fee is $150.\n\nIf you are interested in adoption, please begin with our adoption application. The link is just below. \n\nPLEASE MAKE SURE YOUR CITY ALLOWS THIS BREED BEFORE APPLYING. THIS DOG IS PUREBRED PIT AND SOME MUNICIPALITIES DO NOT ALLOW THIS BREED. PLEASE VERIFY THIS BREED IS ALLOWED BEFORE APPLYING.\n\nTo make the best possible match for you and the pet, please click below to complete the Adoption Application. \n\nOnce your application has been processed, we'll be in contact. \n\nWe cannot schedule a meet and greet without a completed application. \n\nIf you are viewing this page through PetFinder, Adopt-a-Pet, etc., please go to http://ootwrescue.org/adoption.html to fill out an application or review our Adoption Process.",

We were told he does need to be fed separate from other dogs, as  he reacted to other dogs walking by his kennel while being fed (not unusual).\n\n\nIf interested in adopting please fill out our no obligation online application at www.puppypawsrescue.org \n\nNote: Our rescue requires that all adopter's current and prior animals are up-to-date on vaccinations (DHLPP & Rabies)  and preventatives (heartworm and flea and tick), unless there is a medical reason not allowing it. All animals in your household should be spayed or neutered unless medically indicated that they should not be or are currently still too young.",

Blue recently arrived to our shelter after her owner was no longer able to care for her. In the home Blue was completely housebroken and very laid back. She can be shy when meeting new people, and sensitive to new situations, but once she warms up she is a big love bug. Blue is selective with her canine friends, so she would need to be the only dog in the home. If there are children in her forever home, they would need to be ages 10 and up. This senior sweetie is an affectionate pup who can't wait to find her forever home. \n\nIf Blue looks like your new companion, give us a call at 234-212-9843 to schedule an appointment to meet her today!",

            "description": "Thor is a bully breed male dog about 2 years old. He absolutely loves people and will hug you and try to get in your lap if you sit with him. He craves attention and really wants an owner and a home, but staff and volunteers are so limited, it's tough to give him more than a few moments of attention per day in a busy shelter setting with so many other pets to tend. Please come meet him and spend some time with him. Thor is desperate for a forever home. He likes to play, but in a shelter setting with a lot of dogs, he is excitable, so we have him in his own fenced area when he goes outside. He may not be the best with other dogs. Thor is a beautiful, muscular dog with ears that stand up. These photos were taken 1/9/20. He came to LCSPCA several months ago as a transfer from county animal control. This wonderful fellow has not gotten adopted yet because his ad fell through the cracks and we just found he was not even on Petfinders. Please call (434) 374-8076 or email lakecountryspca@yahoo.com to adopt. Visit LCSPCA Mon-Sat. from 12-4 om at 11764 Hwy. 15, Clarksville, VA 23927.",

            "description": "Hello!  Thank you for checking out McBugle's listing.  Please read carefully for details on our adoption process:\n\u2022First, please note that we are unable to receive correspondence through Petfinder\u2019s system.  Any messages sent through Petfinder or any buttons on this listing will unfortunately not reach us. If you\u2019re interested in adopting please visit www.sanctuaryrescue.com and submit an adoption questionnaire under the forms section.\n\u2022 Applications for puppies are open for two to three days in order to give ample opportunity to prospective adopters. At the end of this 48-72 hour period we will change the adoption listing to \u201cApplications Closed\u201d. At this point we will begin reviewing all applications received. Next, foster parents will contact approved applicants to set up a meet and greet. This can take up to 1 to 2 weeks.\n\u2022 Once a dog is officially adopted we will remove its listing from Petfinder. So if this listing is gone, this dog has found its forever family and is no longer available.\n\u2022 Since Covid lockdown orders, we have seen a massive increase in people interested in adopting dogs (yay!). This means each dog, especially puppies, receive multiple applications in the couple of days we have applications open. There is usually several applicants for one puppy. If it doesn\u2019t work out this time, please understand this is not a personal judgement but likely a result of supply and demand. We encourage you to reapply in the future.\n\nThis lucky pup landed in the lap of Sanctuary Rescue with five siblings We are estimating them to be about nine weeks old. We never met mom or dad so breed and size is a pure guess. We estimate they'll be in the 40-50 pound range when full grown. These pups spend their time wrestling with the siblings, lounging around the house, playing tug and just enjoying some good old puppy fun. These pups are well socialized and love everyone they meet. They are young enough to learn about cats.\n\nMcBugle's foster says: \"McBugle loves to snuggle. She is shy, sweet, and curious about the cats in the house (who are less than interested). She loves to play with her toys. Laesh and potty training are in progress.\"\n\nMCBugle's adoption fee is $295, which includes age-appropriate vaccinations, spay, and microchip. If you would like to make this gorgeous girl a part of your family, please visit sanctuaryrescue.com and complete an adoption questionnaire under the \u201cForms\u201d tab.",

            "description": "I'll be your best friend!\nI am looking for my forever best friend! My personality is the epitome of what it means to be a heeler. I want to be around my person and alwaystouching them when we are together. I love to play tug, chew bones, and get exercise. If I can cuddle while doing so, even better! Most importantly, I LOVE CARS! I always want to hop in the car or truck.I am afraid of new experiences, but I am brave. As long as I can smell around, I will warm up to the new person, place, or thing. Although I am deaf, I constantly check in and read the social cues given by people and other animals, aswell. I'd do best in a home with children 13 years and older.\n\nGeneral Socialization Notes:\n\n I have lived with cats and older children. I do fine with some dogs, but will need a slow introduction and very specific boundaries in the house as I tend to guard resources. While outside on a leash, I have only shown positive interest in other dogs. When I am uncomfortable with another dog, I will warn them with a low growl.Typically, I warm up quickly after my warning. I have not had any accidents inside.I am fully potty trained. I love my crate!I am learning to walk on a leash, but I pull and try to play tug with it. I am a bit mouthy and need help to curb that behavior.\n\nDoes Stark like other pets?\n\n I have lived with cats prior to my foster and showed little interest. I show a lot of interest in the cats I live with currentlybecause they react to me.I do betterwith female dogsthat are my size.I have shown extreme resource guarding with the large dogs whom I live with currently. I am working on that. Outside of the house, I only show positive interest in all dogs.\n\nDoes Stark like children?\n\n I have only lived with teenagers prior to my foster home. Outside of the home I have not enjoyed watching kids run around. They make me nervous. I'd do best in a home with children 13 years and older.\n\nFavorite Toys:\n\n I love rope toys to play tug. I also enjoybones, kongs, and other hard chew toys. I would probably enjoy soft toystoo, but my foster siblings rip soft toys to pieces before I have a chance to play with them.\n\nIdeal Forever Home:\n\n A home with active people think bicyclists or runners would be wonderful!I have alot of energy.I would love it if you allow me to go on car rides with you daily because I love the car.I need someone with a lot of patience and someone willing totrain with me especially since I'm deaf! I would love a place that likes cuddles and constant interaction. I bond with my person& quickly and would love to give you all my loyalty and companionship!",

I love meeting new people.I love laying in my human'slap and getting all the attention. Being close to my human means a lot to me.Walks are my favorite part of the day and I love running around outside, especiallyin the snow. I'd do best in a home as an only dog. I'm still learning my manners. A home with children 13 years and older would be best too.\n\nGeneral Socialization Notes:\n\nI am great with people. I love getting attention. I get very excited when I see dogs while I'm out on a walk and I might do best in a home as an only dog. I would love to train with my human, so I can learn my manners and bond.\n\nDoes Amari like other pets?\n\n I get extremely excited initially when I'maround other dogs. It is hard to control my excitement.I might be a bit pushy. I'd do best in a home as an only dog. I'm not too sure about cats because I haven't met any.\n\nDoes Amari like children?\n\n I am not too sure. I have not met any children while I've been in my foster home. I might be a little over exuberant being aroundlittle ones, so maybe a home with children 13 years and older would be best for me.\n\nFavorite Toys:\n\n Ropes and bones are my favorite! I love burying my bones too.\n\nIdeal Forever Home:\n\n I would love to be ina homewhere Ican take frequent walks, play ina nice backyard. I'd enjoyhumans who cangive me lots of attention. Training will be very important for me. I sometimes do not like being alone, but I am doing okay with that. I'd do best as an only dog and in a homewith children 13 years and older.",

If you are expecting me to be loving, easily trainable, and a best friend -- you are right on the money. In addition, if you think I might like water, swimming, and going on adventures with you -- you would win an award for Accuracy! I am all of those things! I like affection, I like people, I love to play with other dogs (though, while playing, I may intimidate small dogs because of my big size), \n\nI am truly am a great mix of the best parts of being a dog: I love to play and run and chase, and then I also love to sprawl out across my person's lap (taking up half the sofa hahaha). I soak up your love because I am perfectly happy being quiet and content too. I am a big lover. \n\nI am a happy boy and I love treats so when we meet, it's best to have a pocketful of them ready to share with me. I had a very wonderful previous owner who took great care of me but who recently passed away. In me, you get a Great Dog who is already had a good amount of training and who is the perfect mix of Fun and Cuddle. If I sound like the dog for you, let's meet soon! Love you, Lil Bit\n",

            "description": "\"Sometimes, best friends have four paws.\" Lada is a happy, friendly, submissive girl who enjoys belly rubs. She will stand and stare at you to get your attention. Lada gets along with other dogs and will play when she wants to. Lada is a low to moderate active Pyr who enjoys sleeping on the chaise.\n\nThe Great Pyrenees Rescue Society retrieved Lada, born around November 2016, weighing about 72 lbs, from a Texas animal shelter as a stray. Lada is house trained and has had some basic training (knows to sit and shake). She walks well on a leash, rides nicely in the car, and loads in and out without help. Lada will bark if something isn't normal outside but will quiet down with a simple \"uh-uh.\" She doesn't like cats and stray dogs.\n\nShe would do well as an \"only dog\" in a family with older, considerate kids, and a securely fenced yard to lounge around would keep Lada happy and safe. She would also thrive in a family with a resident canine companion but must be near her size. She is an affectionate, intelligent girl and needs a confident leader in her family that is familiar with Pyr traits and habits. If you are looking for a best friend with four paws, complete an application for Lada.\n\nAll dogs and puppies require VISIBLE fencing\n\nAdoption Fee: $325. (Adoption fee includes spay/neuter, heartworm test, rabies, distemper, parvo and health certificate for travel). Northwest adopters pay the cost of transport to independent transport service ($200). Adoption applications can be found on our website at https://www.greatpyreneesrescuesociety.org/.\n\nADOPTION, FOSTERING, AND DONATIONS are just some of the ways you can help a rescued dog. We have worked hard to cultivate a large network of volunteers to save this majestic breed. While monetary donations are always much appreciated, you can also help by donating your time as a GPRS foster or volunteer!",

            "description": "Hi there!  My name is Sebastian! I am a Labrador Retriever and I am 7 years old and I weigh 70 pounds!\n\nI was part of a group of dogs that a rescue started helping in a bad part of town. Rescues had come in and picked all the youngsters and left me and an older lady doggie friend all by ourselves on the street. Finally, after a lot of networking, a rescue heard we were still there and came to get us. I hopped right in her car but my friend, well, she had to get fancy and corner in someone's yard! I was SO friendly, I was trying to help our rescuer get my buddy the whole time! Didn't she know a good person when she saw one???\n\nI had called shotgun in the car and was immediately our rescuer's best bud. I kept popping her hand off the shift to stick my head under it so she could pet me better. I'm very considerate that way and still do that whenever I'm sitting next to someone and I think they've forgotten how to pet me. They got me neutered, up to date on shots, current on heartworm/flea prevention and microchipped. Unfortunately, after a long time of being on the street with no one to take care of me, I was heartworm positive but I have already been through treatment and am raring to go....to my new home with YOU, of course!  I would make you proud to be my parent!\n\nI really love all people....little ones, big ones, tall ones and short ones, young ones and old ones..... it doesn't make any difference to me! I would love a home with just about anyone who would show me affection even if they've got kids or grandkids running around. I'm a little bit older boy so I don't need quite as much action as some of those youngsters out there but I still like to go for a walk down the road with my foster mom and I get super excited when I see people! I would probably do best in a home as an only dog or maybe just with a submissive female. My foster mom is still working with me all the time to make me the best boy I can be!\n\nI am still located in Houston, Texas but am super excited to find my forever home and get transported to your area! Will you be my family? I promise you won't regret it.  I will be your best friend for a long, long time!  If you would adopt me, my adoption fee is $450 and that covers my flight to Seattle (only availability during COVID-19), my vetting, microchip, travel crate, cost of the flight and a Health Certificate needed in order to travel out of state.  See?  I'm a real bargain!!!  So, if you live anywhere around Seattle or within driving distance, please email doggydarlings12@gmail.com and you will make me a very happy boy!\n",

            "description": "This adorable little girl is Piper!  We believe her to be an Italian Greyhound mix.  Those long, long legs and deep chest features are classic!  She currently weighs 12 pounds and may be 14 pounds when fully grown.  Piper loves to play with the foster dogs in her temporary home so we would prefer to place her in a home with another dog for company and play.  Since Piper is still a puppy, we would like a stay at home parent for her and also one that will enroll her in training classes.  We would require that the youngest family members be at least 14 years of age.  Her adoption fee includes a crate, training literature, toys, collar, leash and name tag. If interested in Piper, please call 248.344.0181 (no emails!) and leave a message...if we are not able to answer at that time. If the dog you are inquiring about is still available, your call will be returned. Thanks so much!",

Boarding is not the best situation for her.\n\nHer story is slightly different from most. She is a 70 lb 8 month old boxer mix girl who has sadly spent most of her life in a crate. The owners bf would kick the crate and curse her when she used the bathroom in the crate (after not being taken out all day). Thankfully, a friend convinced the owner to surrender her to us. She is a great dog with a loyd, ferocious bark. (A good guard dog) but the bark is just that. She loves being loved and getting lots of attention. We arent sure how she would do with other dogs. We would also not want her to be with small kids only because she mat knock them down not meaning to. She is a very strong girl who as you might guess LOVES running and playing. She still has alit of making up to do for being caged. (See her video). She is scheduled to be spayed next week and needs to be moved from boarding as soon as possible. She needs more love and attention than a boarder can give. She is crate/potty trained. Please consider either giving her a temporary home or possibly a permanent one. She deserves the best from an active owner/family!\n\nFoster Application Link:\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf2s67Gs7HN4IYvl42qprtJYyitT7HSUiDTa6N6y_ll-4TXVA/viewform",

This handsome boy is fully trained and knows all his basic commands and very well behaved.\nHe walks really well on leash, doesnt pull.  He is good with dogs that he lives with after he accepts them in his pack but not a dog to take dog parks. Rex is a dominant dog so any other dogs in his future home needs to be ok with a dominant male.\n\nHe is housebroken, crate trained  and not destructive when left alone..He is very calm in the house, loves to hang out with his owner. \nHe was purchased from a breeder when he was a puppy, but due to personal problems within the family, Rex needs a new home..\n\nBest type of home for Rex : \nAdult only home no kids.\nSomeone knows and understands  protective breeds.\nSince he was owned by the same family since he was born, he needs someone patient to take their time for his adjustment to his new people.\nA house or a condo with a yard.",

Both my sister (Brandy) and I love to army crawl into your lap. If you are sitting on the floor and you call us, we are sure to get low and crawl into that lap of yours. I really think I am a lap dog! I am around 7 months old, and around 35 pounds. I am believed to be part shepherd and maybe part cattle dog as well. My foster mom is still working on potty training as well as crate training as I am still young. If you are interested in me, reach out to my foster mom Liz at 214-616-6128, or if you think im the perfect match, fill out an adoption application on our website! Hope to be in your forever home sooner than later, and if you have a deck for me to lie on, that's a plus!\n\nJohnny Walker is heartworm tested, neutered, as well as up to date on vaccines and even microchipped! If you are interested in adopting him, fill out an application at https://shelter2rescue.org/DogAdoption.html",

He was found on the train tracks in Tribes Hill and noone came looking for him. \nCan you believe it? Us either! \nHe is gorgeous!\nJones needs some training. He is not housebroken and had very little manners when he first came in. He may be able to live with a female dog - but he plays veryyy rough. Until he has a little more maturity and training under his collar, then it may be better for him to be a solo pup. But we would absolutely do a meet and greet if we felt it was possible. He needs a home with no kitties or small children. Older kids if any. Jones takes some time to warm up to new people, he is very timid of new people and loves to hang close to those he knows best. \nJones LOVES to play. And I have a feeling he would be quite the adventure buddy!",

I was a little skinny and had a lot of scabs and boo boos on my head, but my great new friends at Ayres fixed me right up and now I am ready to find a family who will make sure that I never feel like I did wandering alone and with those injuries ever again. I love people that I have met so far, but I may be a little too much for small kids right now. I want to be friends with another dog, but I play really rough and a lot of dogs cannot handle it. So maybe for now, a family all of my own would be best. I really just need someone to love me and continue to teach me what life is and what I am supposed to do. I really want to be the bestest boy. I paw-romise! I am still a young guy - only about 2 years old, even though I look much more distinguished. I got to see the doggy doctor and now all is left is seeing a new family who wants me to be theirs forever. That isn't too much to ask is it? I hope someone sees my soulful eyes and just melts into them and then has to message my friends at Ayres to see how to come meet me! Until then, I will continue to love and play with a full belly and warm blanket. And I will hope that my friends that see this may share me and tell friends about me until my happily ever is found!\"\"",

Frosty is a special boy who has an incontinence issue. Frosty is constantly dripping pee. We have ran many tests and tried all recommended medications without success of fixing the issue.\n\nThe following is list of the tests that we have run on Frosty:\n\nBloodwork CBC & superchem\nUrinalysis\nUrine culture & sensitivity M130\nSecond Urine culture & Mic susceptibility was ran at different vet\nUltrasound (results were normal)\nSenior profile with heartworm\nCT Scan (results were normal)\n\nFrosty was then put on medications, and sadly they did not help.\n\nNow Frosty is in a foster home wondering if the perfect family will ever come for him. We reassure this handsome boy that they will, and when they do it will be meant to be. ?\n\nFrosty is fixed, utd on shots, dewormed, flea treated and microchipped. He is a goofy lovable dog. He has a dominate personality, plays great with other dogs but does have dominate issues and will start fights over food and toys. For this reason we suggest an only dog home.\n\n\nAlthough Frosty is a special needs boy, that doesn't make him less deserving of a forever home. Frosty is just patiently waiting for that wonderful family to see him and know that he was meant to be theirs\n\nHelp us help this boy find the home of his dreams. ??",

            "description": "Name: Norma Jean (fka Treasure)\nSuspected Breed: Rottweiler\nApproximate Age: 7 years old\nApproximate Weight: 95 lbs\nPersonality: Sweet and sensitive\t\nObservations with Dogs: has done well with other dogs\nObservations with Cats: not yet tested\nObservations with Kids: not yet tested\nCurrently Living at: DMV-area foster\n \nNorma Jean was a staff favorite at our partner shelter in PG County. She came to the shelter when her owner passed away. She is friendly with people and gentle when taking a treat. She would love to warm your house with her love this winter.\n\nSadly, she will have to undergo heartworm treatment and will need 8 weeks of recovery. This means she will need strict crate rest for a few weeks and only short trips outside to go potty. We can provide guidance and information, but dogs in heartworm recovery tend to be fairly easy to care for as long as they are not super high energy. Heartworm is not contagious among dogs or between species, including cats and humans. She may have a cough the first several days and will need to take 30 days of antibiotics to prevent complications, but otherwise should be easy to care for. She will need to be retested for heartworm in 8-10 months to confirm that the treatment was successful in eradicating all heartworms (treatment rarely fails).\n\nLike most shelter dogs, Norma Jean may need a refresher on housetraining and crate training. We ask all of DC PAWS' fosters to work on both house and crate training with their foster dog.\n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $200. If you are interested in adopting Norma Jean, please submit an adoption application at https://dcpawsrescue.org/adoption-info/adoption-application-dogs/ABOUT US & IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES:\n\nPlease note that you must use our official adoption application in order to be considered for adoption. Applying through other sites (i.e., Petfinder) will not work. The following are our applications:\n\nDog application: https://service.sheltermanager.com/asmservice?account=bg0781&method=online_form_html&formid=1\nCat application: https://service.sheltermanager.com/asmservice?account=bg0781&method=online_form_html&formid=6\n\nDC PAWS Rescue does our best to provide accurate and complete information about our adoptable animals. Please note that we cannot make any guarantees about age or breed; we rely upon our rescue partners and their veterinarians to make those assessments. We also cannot make any guarantees about housebreaking and animal temperament, as animals can behave differently through transition and in different environments.\n\nOur shelter partners provide a basic vet screening for each animal we rescue, which includes necessary vaccinations, deworming, microchipping, and spay/neuter (unless the animal is too young or otherwise deemed by the vet to not be a good candidate for surgery). Please note that this is not a comprehensive medical exam and as such, may not identify any and all medical issues, though our goal is to flag any obvious health issues through the basic vet screening. We share all medical records with adopters and are completely transparent about any known issues prior to adoption finalization. \n\nABOUT DC PAWS RESCUE\n\nOur rescue is an all-volunteer, foster-based dog and cat rescue in the DC area. We rescue locally from Prince Georges County, MD, and from rural shelters in the south (presently Pickens County, Anderson County, and Greenville County in SC, and Raleigh County, WV).\n\nWe partner with a local rescuer in Pickens County, SC, who saves adoptable cats and dogs from the three area shelters. For the animals in this rural area, rescue is a critical lifeline, and often the only lifeline. Our rescue partner not only works with DC PAWS to save as many dogs and cats as possible, but she has also established a successful spay/neuter program in the community to decrease the number of homeless and unwanted animals over the long term.\n\nFOSTER AN ANIMAL IN NEED\n\nFosters make it possible for DC PAWS to save and care for homeless, neglected and abandoned animals! To learn about fostering dogs or cats for DC PAWS Rescue, please visit: http://dcpawsrescue.org/volunteer/fostering/foster-application\n\nSPONSOR AN ANIMAL IN NEED\n\nFor any of our animals! Sponsors help us provide critical medical care, food, boarding, and other support for animals facing euthanasia. Individuals who sponsor a dog or cat receive special recognition on the animal's profile. Sponsorships can also be made in honor or memory of a loved one, and you may designate to whom DC PAWS Rescue should provide notice of your gift. Sponsorship levels of $250 and $150 include \"\"naming rights\"\" for a future dog or cat (respectively) that we rescue.\n\nTo learn more about sponsorship, please visit: http://dcpawsrescue.org/donate/",

Max was extremely stressed at the shelter (as many dogs are). He was snappy with their staff, but once he made it to a foster home, he finally found some sweet relief! However, he did end up at the shelter because he was in a home with children that were really stressing him out. For this reason, he needs a patient adopter with an adult-only household and no plans for child visitors. \n\nMax's ideal adopter is someone who is patient and willing to work with him to become even more confident in himself! Max needs slow introductions, so his adopter must not rush into introductions. We can recommend a trainer who can arm you with the knowledge of how to read him and help set him up for success. The other benefit of training is to help build trust between you and Max and a deeper bond. \n\nMax has done well with other dogs. He has not been cat tested yet but can be. \n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $350.

While indoors, this super cuddly boy mainly wants to drape himself across his human's lap. This loving, goofy dude came to his foster with a possible spinal injury that has affected his walking. He's energetic and appears to be recovering nicely. For now, he is on crate-rest with only a few short, slow walks in the front yard for bathroom breaks. His walking is improving, and he especially walks well on his leash. Once he is healed, he is going to be a great companion for someone who enjoys outdoor activities. Poland seems thrilled to have a home and shows his affection every chance he gets. He's happy to carry around his favorite toy, a skunk that crinkles and squeaks, but rests comfortably in his cage when his people are away. When they're home, he is content to sit at their feet all day long. He's also housetrained so you don't have to worry about accidents while you're away! Poland hopes for a home with people he can be near all day who will take him for walks whenever they have a few spare minutes. He'd also prefer not to have to deal with any of those cat creatures. Come meet this lovable boy. He'll want to observe you and then follow you home!",

She is great with kids and treats them as her own. She is house trained and crate trained. She is very smart and very obedient, she knows how to 'sit, 'come, 'stay, and 'shake. Snow is slower to warm up to new people (mainly men), but she warms up to them over time. She can be left at home, but will miss you greatly the first 20 minutes and then wait patiently until you return. Her energy levels are versatile as she will rest as you work (but paw you for the occasional hug), and she is ready to run when it's time to play. Snow White would love to have friends, but on her terms as she likes to be the center of her human's attention. She can play nicely with others, but needs to be watched closely. She would love to move to a calm home where she can spend time with the ones she loves. She would do best as the only pet and a quiet home with a large backyard and few visitors. Come meet Snow White, she would love to cuddle!",

He already spooned with you before you left in the morning, and now when you watch TV, he'll put his head in your lap if that's okay. He's also happy to settle on the couch just for your belly rubs. This gentle, calm boy's perfect day starts with a good breakfast. Then he'll want a power nap, followed by a long walk with lots of water. Then he'd like another nap with snuggles, another walk, then night bedtime. He walks well on his leash, pulling when he's excited, but he is easily called back. He'll roll on his back and wiggle when he finds a good patch of grass. Get down to his level and he may tackle you with kisses, then wait for those belly rubs. At home, he is a house-trained boy who sleeps well in his crate with adorable snoring. Oz is an easygoing, affectionate boy who will love a home with people who can give him a comfy couch, plenty of room to stretch out in and those weekend hikes he enjoys. Come meet him. He's your next loving, loyal buddy.",

            "description": "Tobias may still look puppyish with his little face and his floppy ears, but this funny boy is a grownup who's already mastered so many skills. Tell him to Sit Pretty, Sit Down and Shake and he'll say, 'Sure. Now let's play ball!' This clever boy always has pep in his steps and loves fetching tossed balls, especially when he can bring them back for treats. And then he'll take off running goofy zoomies. He can be reserved and cautious when meeting new people, but becomes very affectionate once he gets to know them well. Play with him and he's off to those zoomies again. And he walks pretty well on his leash. Tobias is a house-trained boy who's happy to spend the night in his crate, especially if his people are near him. He prefers to be the only pet in a home with human grownups so that he can have all their attention - and treats. And he hopes they'll be home with him most of the day. This fun and funny dog has a lot of character and quirk. He is definitely not here for the couch potato lifestyle, but if you have some active, sporty people in your home, he will be a great fit. If that describes you, come meet him!",

            "description": "Sweet Tortilla is a special lady who needs a human who can provide her love and take care of her. This gentle lady was not around humans for most of her life, and as a result she can be extremely shy, and takes time to warm up to new humans. Once she does, she is a gentle lass who is sweet and learns quickly. She does well when her humans are away and will hang quietly in the house. She also gives good eye contact, with expressive eyes, eyebrows and brow wrinkles. She is starting to come out of her shell in her foster home, and is making good progress. Tortilla is a retired mama who was very dedicated to her pups, but for the moment prefers to be around very chill pups, or would prefer to be the solo dog in the house. She would also thrive in a low-traffic, adults only home. She is house-trained and if taken out three times a day, she will quickly take care of business and walks around the yard. She would love a fairly quiet home that has a backyard where she can learn to stay calm in the yard. Once her foster gave her time to adjust, Tortilla will touch her nose to her foster's hand and give little kisses. She will also allow short pets and seems to enjoy it. She gives good eye contact and responds when she is talked to. She walks on leash, but gets anxious with new surroundings. She is on anxiety medicine to help curb her fears, and she just loves her medication in peanut butter! Given time, patience, and gentle people she will snuggle someday. She responds well to praise and is food motivated. If you have a low-key, patient, and loving home, come meet this sweet and gentle spirit, her expressive eyes will make you melt.",

            "description": "Achilles was found as a stray, but he has so much affection for people that we think he may not have always been on his own. He constantly wants to snuggle and when he sees his people coming, he wags his little tail with all his might! He loves to be by your side and will lay his big adorable head on your leg Or lean his whole body against you. His APA! friends rave about his kisses and how speedy and sneaky he is with them. Achilles is great on leash and loves to go on long walks. He's also a very patient guy and is perfectly content to let you stop and chat with people along the way. He's not particularly interested in other dogs and seems to prefer just spending his time with his people, but he has become enamored with playing fetch, if fetch means running around with the ball in his mouth. He hasn't figured out the other half of fetch yet, but we're working on it. Achilles is also working on being the best dog he can be in APA!'s Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC's Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Achilles has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told 'free,' and coming when called. Once Achilles successfully completes all the skills on his training plan he will be considered TOP Dog Ready. Achilles is working hard to become a wonderful companion, and as a part of APA's Total Obedience Program you can work with APA! staff to continue to build a training relationship with Achilles after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA's CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193 This easy-going pooch is a joy to be around and can't wait to meet his family. A more loyal companion you'll never find. Come meet him! Follow Achilles on Instragram @achilles_austin",

She has so much training that she has a blast showing off her skills to the people she loves. Then, this goofy, mischievous girl loves to play with her humans. This playful girl is always friendly with strangers she meets, offering them her adorable 'shake.' She's a very affectionate lady who enjoys snuggling with the human best friends she hangs out with. She also enjoys car rides, leash walks, and romping with her toys, especially the stuffies she loves. Cali had an unfortunate incident in her past. She got in a fight with a neighboring dog in 2019. That dog's owner reported her to Austin Animal Services, which then ruled that she can't be adopted inside the Austin city limits. So, she hopes for a home in a suburb or even out in the country with adopters who can continue her training. With all the fun skills she's already learned, she'll be so entertaining! Come meet Cali, she would love to show off her skills.",

As a young Whippet mix, Oreo would love life in a home with a fenced yard where he can run and play to his heart's content... but he would also like to be welcomed indoors as a part of your family. In his short life, Oreo has not known life indoors but he would love to learn... and this kid is a fast learner. Oreo is eager to learn and connect with a family of his own. Oreo is still discovering how to be social with other dogs and may benefit from a mature, social, friendly dog to share his home with. During his behavior test at the shelter, he was happily curious about other dogs but a little unsure how to play! He would benefit from positive reinforcement training to learn new skills and tricks. He would also love to have daily enrichment opportunities, like solving food puzzles or sniffing lots of smells, so that he can use his active and keen brain. Oreo already knows his name, ''sit'', and ''high five.'' Oreo has a lot of energy and can be nervous around new people so he would be best suited in an adult only home, with humans who will give him the time and patience he needs to be his best self. Once he gets to know you, Oreo is a fun pup who listens well and loves to engage with you by showing off his skills! If you're looking for a friend who will blossom into your bestest buddy, Oreo may be just the one for you. Overall, Oreo is a really good boy who deserves the chance to shine - will you be the one to help Oreo be his best self?",

            "description": "Jean-Michel is little brother to Frida from the Artists Pallet Litter.  He is 4 months old, 20 pounds, born in mid September. Based on current weight we can only estimate that he will be medium size as an adult (between 45 and 55 pounds).\nMore information will soon be provided along with more pictures.  Her breed may include Pit Bull, Carolina Dog, or Mountain Cur according to Bing Dog Breed Selector. He has a mellow but playful attitude.\n\nRequirements include applicant be a minimum of 25 years old, long term renter or home owner.  Previous personal experience raising and socializing large breed dogs will be given priority.\n\nApplications are at karmicrescue.org\n\nWhat breed is my dog? Please remember we do not complete DNA tests on our rescued pups. If we do not know who the mom or dad is for sure, we guess; we use Bing Visual Search. And, we look at their paws, ears, snout, coloring, and body build. So often, we are not spot on. Mutts are usually more healthy than not. And, remember too that even if you know the supposed dominant breed in your new puppy or adult dog, it does not mean that those particular genes will dominate your dog's personality.",

Both were turned over to rescue from the shelter, so that we could provide immediate medical attention to both.  Maurice has had surgery for bilateral \"cherry eye,\" and has healed nicely.  He is currently on medication for heartworm treatment, and can go to  his forever home now with special instructions to remain quiet.  Maurice has been described as a bit of a spaz because he is so high-energy, but he is learning to walk nicely on a leash and to stay quiet when he is in his wire cage.  Maurice is very sweet, but he will need to learn some manners such as not jumping and barking at his water bowl!  \n \nADOPTION INFO:  Maurice's adoption fee is $395.00, which includes a physical exam, all vaccinations, neuter, cherry eye surgery, deworming and any other care received while in rescue.  If you would like to adopt Maurice, please complete an application on our website at: www.HoustonBostonRescue.org   \n\nFACEBOOK:  Be sure to follow our current events and new incoming rescues on our Facebook page at:  Facebook,com/BostonTerrierRescue \n\nVIRTUAL FOSTERING:  If you are unable to foster in person, but would still like to help, you can become a virtual foster!  For as little as $20,00 a month, you can virtually foster any of our rescues!  More information can be found on our website at:  www.HoustonBostonRescue.org\n\nNOTE:  All of our foster parents and volunteers work full-time, so please respect  their personal time. Our rescues are available to meet once your application has been approved. Thank you for your understanding!",

If you would like to adopt Margaux or any of our other rescues, please complete an application on our website at: www.HoustonBostonRescue.org  Please note that we process all applications in the order received.\n\nFACEBOOK:  Be sure to keep up with all of our new arrivals and rescue activities on our Facebook page:   Facebook.com/BostonTerrierRescue\n\nSPONSOR A RESCUE: If you would like to sponsor Margaux or any of our other rescues, please go to our website to find out how you can help:  Thank you! \nwww.HoustonBostonRescue.org",

All of his nine siblings are just as beautiful and look just like him. We are so excited about the puppy palooza going on at our shelter we wanted to share some of the cuteness so you could get your application filled out and come to visit all of the pups. They won't be ready for adoption for a couple of months but now is the time to pick out the one you want to make a member of your family!Contact us at straydogshelter@gmail.com for more information on this dog.",

            "description": "Age: Approx 5 Years Old\nLocation: Calgary\nBreed: Chihuaua\nSex: Spayed Female\nWeight: 10lbs\nEnergy: Medium\nHealth Notes: Chronic dry eye requires daily eye ointment\nCats: Not Tested\nDogs: Ellie Loves Dogs and needs to live with another dog that will engage with her. \nKids: Ellie is ok to be around kids, but prefers to live in an adult only home\nAdoption fee: $475\n\nMeet little Ellie. This sweet girl can be described as gentle, playful, cuddly, affectionate, loving, and smart. Ellie has come a long way since arriving at her dedicated foster home. Once a scared, overly shy, and reserved girl, she has slowly come out of her shell  with both dogs and humans (once she gets to know them).\n\nIn her day to day, Ellie can be found entertaining herself with toys and puzzles, playing with her foster siblings or snuggling up with her foster mom in cozy blankets. She loves toys so much, she will empty the toy basket, cover the floor in her toys and go to town for hours! Ellie is great at puzzles and figures them out quickly, she has even shown her foster siblings tricks on how to find all the treats!\n\nAs a very smart girl, Ellie has come a long way with her house training but accidents can happen if she\u2019s not being carefully watched or isn\u2019t let outside often. With consistency, we believe Ellie will master this soon!\n\nEllie seeks guidance from other dogs and although is friendly with dogs of all sizes, she absolutely adores smaller dogs and wants to have a forever fur sibling of her own. It takes Ellie some time to get comfortable with new humans. It took weeks before she allowed her foster parents to give her pets, but once she realized how good the pets felt she quickly took up cuddling, asking for more pets, giving kisses and even playing with them. Because she is nervous at first, Ellie will require a slower adoption including a few visits with her adopters before starting a trial.\n\nWhen Ellie arrived into care with RDDR both her eyes were infected as she has chronic dry eye that had not been treated. We quickly got her infection dealt with and her eyes are now feeling good. She requires eye drops administered twice a day for the rest of her life. A bottle of her drops costs about $70 and lasts about 1.5 to 2 months.\n\nEllie's requirements for her forever home includes:\n-Another small dog that will engage in play.\n-A patient and loving adopter who will give her the time to adjust to a new home.\n-A quiet home with no children \u2013 Ellie gets easily scared of fast movements or busy environments.\n-A mom or dad who is comfortable administering her daily eye drops.\n-Toys, toys, puzzles and more toys! (also lots of treats)\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Ellie, please fill out an adoption application at rosierday.com/adopt\n\nThe application must be submitted and reviewed before a meet and greet will be arranged.\n\nPlease be patient in waiting to hear back from us as the dogs care is our priority and all of our volunteers work as well as run the rescue in their spare time. You should hear from us within 72 hours.",

Her first year of life, she was tied on a short rope outside and was never given the love she so deserves. She is working on gaining some weight and her skin is becoming healthier with each day in her new home.\n\nIt's unfathomable that someone could treat her soo poorly because as she has settled into her warm foster home, she has shown herself to be an absolute lover. She loves to sleep in the chair next to her foster mom during the work day. But then every few hours she realizes she needs some more love, so she crawls up on her mom's lap for some pets and kisses. She is starting to get the zoomies every so often, so she feels safe and relaxed in her new home. With time, we hope she will continue to feel more comfortable and start to become more independent. But for now, she's her mom's little shadow.\n\nShe is working on certain manners still, like not jumping up to check out what's on the kitchen counter or up on new people, but she is cat/dog/people friendly, tolerant of baths, loves car rides, and does not chew on anything she shouldn't. She is learning that life is different now and that she will get food on a regular basis, so she will patiently sit when she knows it's meal time. She does appear to be a bit protective of her toys and foster mom around other dogs.\n\nUnfortunately she hates the crate, but she sleeps great on her mom's bed all night long with no interruptions. On the bright side, she doesn't seem to need a crate for potty-training. She had only one accident in the house her first day here (whoops!) but nothing since!\n\nShe loves going for walks and will spin in circles with excitement. That excitement leads to her pulling at first, but after that she walks nicely...unless she sees a squirrel; in that case, she is dying to chase it! With some good leash training, these issues could be fixed.\n\nOverall, Angel is an amazing dog who is looking for a family that will be accepting of all the love she has to give.\n\nThe adoption fee covers the cost of the animal's spay/neuter surgery, microchipping, FIV/FeLK testing (for cats) or Heartworm Testing (for dogs), deworming and all core age appropriate vaccinations. For the most complete information regarding this animal, and all of our adoptable pets, please ensure you are visiting our website directly at www.RescueCrew.org. You can also access the necessary online adoption application here as well. Thank you.",

She loves long walks to get out her abundant energy, and has been working on leash manners, an education which will need to continue in her forever home. Tasia has been learning how to be goofy like the mad hatter, enjoying toys and marrow bones during tea time. She will close the day's adventures by putting her paws up on the bed asking whether she can join her human for an overnight snuggle session.\n\nTasia does well in a home with other dogs of any size, ready to make them tweedle dee to her tweedle dum. She has not yet been to a realm with cats or young children, so we are unsure whether a home with either of them will grow or shrink her confidence.\n\nTasia is a gentle soul, ready to open herself up to new adventures in a forever home filled with kindness, safety, patience and love that will help her bloom into the heroine she is destined to be. Don't be late for a very important date with this sweet girl, apply to meet Tasia at https://rescuecrew.org/adopt-animal-in-need/#adoptionapplication\n\nThe adoption fee covers the cost of the animal's spay/neuter surgery, microchipping, FIV/FeLK testing (for cats) or Heartworm Testing (for dogs), deworming and all core age appropriate vaccinations. For the most complete information regarding this animal, and all of our adoptable pets, please ensure you are visiting our website directly at www.RescueCrew.org. You can also access the necessary online adoption application here as well. Thank you.",

Gracie is around 2 years old and has had a pretty rough life.\n\nHer first owner was diagnosed with cancer and Gracie stayed with her owner until her owner died. She was rehomed after spending nearly a year with her original owner.\n\nHer second owner was diagnosed with cancer and Gracie again stayed with her owner until she died a few months ago.  A family member of the second owner took her for a while but was not able to keep her.  HappiDog stepped in and now \n\n\nGracie is in love with her foster family, even though this is now her 4th placement in 2 years!  She follows the family's teenage daughter everywhere!\n\nWe think Gracie will do best in a home with teenage or older kids. She is a bit nervous around younger kids.  She loves older people and she is particularly fond of women. We think all of her previous owners were female.\n\nGracie does like to play but is content to hang with her person. She is a very petite little girl, weighing only about 8 pounds.\n\nIf you are interested in welcoming Gracie into your family, please go to happidogrescue.com and fill out an online application.\n\nAdoption fee is $295.",

He is very friendly and playful with the other dogs. He would love a doggy friend to play with. Fine with the cats. No food aggression with people. The young lady who found him loves him & knows he will find an amazing home. He has an amazing personality.  Goof is approximately 4 years old, 49 pounds (thin) and will arrive from Chesapeake, VA on 1/20.  We still need a foster as he waits for approved application to be adopted.   neuter next week !!\n****\nWe look forward to your interest in applying to adopt ! Events are on Saturdays..watch facebook!  All available listed on website, donation button(we are non-profit) & links to adopt/volunteer www.lovemuttsrescue.org , We will email you our process & fees.  Thank you, The Love Mutts Rescue Team",

Russo is a sweetheart, and is currently in a foster home in the Austin area. As you can see in the photos, Russo and his best buddy Landon share lots of good times together!\n \nADOPTION INFO:  Russo has limited sight due to cataracts. He had chronic skin issues when he arrived in rescue, but his foster mom Kelley has been taking great care of him and his skin has healed nicely.  Russo's adoption fee is $295.00, which includes a physical exam, all vaccinations, neuter, heartworm test, deworming and all medical care received while in rescue.  If you would like to adopt Russo, please complete an application on our website at: www.HoustonBostonRescue.org   \n\nFACEBOOK:  Be sure to follow our current events and new incoming rescues on our Facebook page at:  Facebook,com/BostonTerrierRescue \n\nVIRTUAL FOSTERING:  If you are unable to foster in person, but would still like to help, you can become a virtual foster!  For as little as $20,00 a month, you can virtually foster any of our rescues!  More information can be found on our website at:  www.HoustonBostonRescue.org\n\nNOTE:  All of our foster parents and volunteers work full-time, so please respect  their personal time. Our rescues are available to meet once your application has been approved. Thank you for your understanding!",

She does have some kidney insufficiency not uncommon in dogs her age but is not requiring treatment currently. She also has an eye ulcer which has improved significantly but will likely need to stay on eye meds for life. She is good on leash, tolerates a crate though has excellent house manners so it is not necessary. She is housebroken with access to a dog door. She had a dental while in rescue and has recovered well. Fiona is approximately 11 years old and about 7 lbs. She is looking for a lap of her own",

When we took her into rescue, our vet found that not only did Martee' have a severe case of heartworms, but she also appeared to be going into heart failure. Martee' is on heart medication, and although we continue to pray for a miracle,, we realize she may not make it out of her foster home. Thank you to the wonderful Lopez family for fostering Martee' and taking such great care of her; and for making her part of their family.\n\nPlease keep Martee' in your thoughts and prayers.   \n\nFACEBOOK:  Be sure to follow our current events and new incoming rescues on our Facebook page at:  Facebook,com/BostonTerrierRescue \n\nVIRTUAL FOSTERING:  If you are unable to foster in person, but would still like to help, you can become a virtual foster!  For as little as $20,00 a month, you can virtually foster any of our rescues!  More information can be found on our website at:  www.HoustonBostonRescue.org\n\nNOTE:  All of our foster parents and volunteers work full-time, so please respect  their personal time. Our rescues are available to meet once your application has been approved. Thank you for your understanding!",

She had a large mammary mass, and vetting found that she was heart worm positive.  As it  turned out she was pregnant delivering 7 pups 2 weeks after rescue.  She didn\u2019t seem to know what petting, ear scratching and hugging was all about when she first arrived.\n\nShe has been in foster for a year now and is on slow kill heart worm treatment (last check still pos).  The mass was removed and she was spayed earlier last year. She recently had dental cleaning.\n\nNola is very smart and learns quickly.  She is house trained, kennel trained, adores taking walks.  She doesn\u2019t get on furniture and doesn\u2019t lick.  She has lived with cats and kittens and with an old chi mix dog with absolutely no problem (except they won\u2019t play with her).  She seems to love every person she meets.\n\nShe is full of life and energy and needs a human or furry companion to play with and a place to run.\n\nOur senior dogs are so grateful of a save, permanent place to lay their head.   Are you interested in meeting this perfect angel?    Contact us about a meet and greet.  \n",

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: 11/19/2020\nReason for being in rescue: Laurens Co AC seized\nFoster Location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SC\nSpecial Needs? Frida was spayed on 12/29/20. She also had a dental with 3 extractions. Frida is up to date on all vaccines and heartworm negative.\nWeight: 16 lb\nHeight: 13 in\nSpayed/Neutered: No\n\nAdoption Fee: $200\n\nFence needed? No\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Frida would thrive in many environments. She is a great companion and easy going pet.\n\nWhat is my personality like? Frida is a happy dog that would like a person with a comfy lap to sit on. She enjoys sitting in high up places so she can observe her surrounds. She has been around other dogs majority of her life and would be more comfortable with at least one other dog in her home. Frida tends to bark a lot when meeting new people, hearing a car or even at the wind. She will alert her owners to anything out of the normal. Due to this she may not do well in an apartment or where there are neighbors in close proximity. She is a laid back dog and would do great in a home where they have plenty of love to go around! A fence would be recommended in her future home.\n\nFrida loves to sit up high and can often be found on the back of the sofa or up on the grooming table.\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Interested\n\nOther tips and tidbits: (11/13/2018 est birthday.) Frida walks well on a leash and is great in a car. She thoroughly enjoyed sitting in the booster seat and watching out the window.\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

Miller would break loose every now and then and got hit by a car several years ago. His leg is so badly bent that it grew that way and cannot be fixed. It doesn't stop him from living a normal life. He came to us with mangled fur, most had to be shaved off and had hot spots all over his back and hips. He had no shelter so it was him verses the weather.\n\nMiller is 4 years old, heartworm positive and very leary of strangers. If he loves you, you have a best friend for life, if he doesn't, he will let you know.\n\nMiller loves his foster mom, loves her dogs, and loves protecting her. He comes inside and loves to check on everyone, but then back outside to guard her property. He would make a wonderful livestock dog or a companion dog if you could keep him from interacting with strangers on his own.\n\nWe have neutered him, put him on slo-kill heartworm treatment, groomed him, vaccinated him and loved him like crazy.\n\nIf you would like more info on Miller, please fill out the online application at www.fots.petfinder.com\n\n\n\n",

We believe the first diagnosis of Fanconi Syndrome given to her was incorrect. She spent 2 days with our vet and after many tests it appears she is diabetic and has mammary tumors. She was just spayed which will hopefully help her sugar levels as it did with Stevie. She is however still insulin dependent and requires daily insulin injections. After she heals from the spay and is better regulated, the doctor will look at removing her mammary chain (tumors). If the surgeries go well, we are hopeful that Kialey will have many years left with us.",

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: 10/20/20\nReason for being in rescue: Lex was found as a stray in Inman SC. The good people who found him advertised and looked for an owner but with no collar/id tag and no microchip, that search was unsuccessful. Lex was listed on several lost and found sites but no one came forward for him.\nFoster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SC\nSpecial Needs? Lex had horrible dental problems with over 30 extractions. He has a 4 out of 6 heart murmur and has been started on Vetmedin (1.25 my twice per day to support his heart. Cost is approximately $2 per day). With all of the nasty bacteria from bad teeth out of his mouth we're hoping the heart will improve. His mouth has healed well. He also has developing cataracts which dims his vision.\nWeight: 12 lbs\nHeight: 11 in\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $200\n\nFence needed? No\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Lex is a gentle little old man looking for a soft place to retire.\n\nWhat is my personality like? Lex is a super chill old soul. He gets along great with everyone and everything. He's a gentle old guy looking for a quiet place to retire. He does take vetmedin for a heart condition. (Vet port). He lost a lot of his teeth so he would have to have extra care when preparing his food. He lays around and sleeps most of the day. He would love a fuzzy bed and lots of sunshine to warm his old bones. He would need a home with other older dogs as the young's ones would run him over. He doesn't move fast. He will come over and ask for affection and loves to sit on your lap. He loves treats and loves to eat. He couldn't do long walks but would love a yard to just wander and sit in the sun with you.\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Friendly\n\nOther tips and tidbits: Estimated birthdate 10/20/09. Please note this is ONLY an estimate. His true age is unknown. He could be older or he could be younger and have had a rough life\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

            "description": "MILLIE is such a very, very sweet Beagle girl. She is everything for why people love Beagles. Running down the side of a Millington highway, she was found by a Good Samaritan and turned into the Millington Animal Hospital for lack of a local shelter. The clinic could not keep her, so we agreed to take her into rescue to keep her from being taken to Memphis Animal Services.\n\nOur doctors and staff quickly fell in love with her, just as everyone else has who has had any interaction with her. One of the first things she received at our clinic was a much needed bath that she thoroughly enjoyed. Her ears were infected, so they were cleaned thoroughly and packed with meds to be checked again in two weeks with another ear cytology. Her bloodwork, thankfully, was great, so we wasted no time in spaying her and did dental care to avoid putting her under anesthesia again. As expected, she tested positive for heartworms, but we are already on that with Doxycycline pre-treatment.  She will be heartworm treated before adoption is permitted. Otherwise, she is in surprisingly good health. She has received both a heartworm preventative, required during heartworm treatment, as well as flea and tick preventative. \n\nMillie is such a loving little Beagle and we are looking for an equally loving family to foster her through heartworm treatment, and that family will be given first consideration for adoption. We call these foster-to-adopt families, and those are the only applications we are considering at the present time for Millie since we never permit adoptions until heartworm treatment and ALL vetting are completed. \n\nIf you are interested in being a part of Millie\u2019s journey to wellness  and be considered as her adopter, we would love to send you our adoption application. We require our fosters to complete the same application as adopters. Please contact Diana at dmoore2003@bellsouth.net if you are interested in Millie.\n\nWe should tell you that all of our Beagles are very popular. Please ask to apply only if you are a serious adopter willing to foster her through vetting and plan on completing our adoption application. We are inundated during the pandemic with adoption application requests. We take great care in the placement of our companion animals and work hard to find as near perfect match as possible between our dogs and their potential adopters.",

She is currently still insulin dependent but that could possibly change in the future. Spaying is so important for a multitude of reasons. If Stevie had been spayed, she may not have developed this condition. We think she has a bright future ahead of her now though. Stevie is much younger than her transfer paperwork had stated. We believe she is only about 4 years old. Despite her age, she does have cataracts which impair her vision. She is young and they could possibly be removed. She is up to date on vaccinations, heartworm and lymes negative, flea treated, wormed, and microchipped. She is an active dog, so she will need a family that can accommodate that. Since she is vision impaired, we will require a home with a secure physical fenced in yard. Medical experience would be preferred as she currently requires 2 insulin shots a day. ** Applications will not be screened if they do not meet the listed requirements.**",

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: 11/17/2020\n\nReason for being in rescue: found as a stray locally\nFoster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SC\nSpecial Needs? none\nWeight: 25.4 lbs\nHeight: est 14\" at the shoulder\n\nAdoption Fee: $ 200\n\nFence needed? No but she would enjoy an area to romp and play off leash several times a week\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Luna is a sweetheart who will thrive in a variety of homes. She would be great for a young family starting out or for a newly retired couple. She is versatile and easy to love. Love you all miss you all stay safe\n\nWhat is my personality like? Luna is one sweet girl she loves to be petted and cuddled. She is good on a leash and is crate trained. She has gotten along with every dog she has meet and been with. When it comes to food she is not a picky eater she loves all food and treats. She is not shy when it comes to new people. She is respectful at the first meeting.\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Sweet and happy.\n\nMore tips and tidbits: Estimated birthdate 6/11/20\n\nPUPPY POLICY:\nThank you for carefully considering the addition of a puppy to your family. Puppies can be a joyous experience, but they can also be a tremendous amount of work. Since our goal is to place each of our dogs in forever homes, we are especially cautious with puppies. We like to stress 3 major things when considering a puppy vs. an adult dog: 1) many adult dogs are well bred, well trained dogs who find themselves in rescue through no fault of their own, 2) adult dogs are eager to share their love and bond with their new family, and 3) puppies will always require far more time, energy, and training than an adult dog.\n\nOur ideal puppy adopters are:\n-experienced dog owners with a solid record of excellent vet care of their previous pets\n-scheduled away from home for no more than 4 hours per day OR have another canine companion already in the home\n-stay at home type of people (work at home, home schoolers, retired, etc)\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

He is not housebroken,  but seems pretty smart and would probably learn quickly. He even waits patiently for treats. He is ready for his forever home! He weighs in at 42 pounds and is heartworm negative.\nThe standard adoption fee for a puppy or a dog is $200 which includes  rabies vaccination, at least one round of parvo distemper vaccine and spay or neuter.   ARF will adopt to residents who are out of state but will not furnish transportation.  Here are a few of our adoption requirements:  All adopters will be asked to fill out an  application. Adopters must be at least 21 years old. Renters must show proof that they are allowed to have pets, such as a rental agreement. If there is a pet deposit, please show us the receipt that this has been paid. Be prepared to take your pet home with you - bring a leash for all dogs, regardless of age or size (or a pet taxi for small puppies and dogs) and a pet taxi for all kittens and cats. \n\nFill out this form if you are interested in adopting a pet from Animal Rescue Foundation. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10mHOUH71ulyBm-xh0HZcOGsusvXJxrS3pXQHCz3f-tQ/viewform?edit_requested=true",

She is a nice young dog that we pulled from the local Animal Control.  Many of these spots in Texas are kill facilities and when they fill up they have to euthanize.  We pulled her before that happened.  She is an active girl and will do best with an outdoorsy family.  She would make a great running, hiking or walking companion.   She pulls when she sees something interesting while on leash but she is attentive and wants direction.  She is good with other dogs but she is a bit much from some dogs because of her enthusiasm.  She is social and will be fine as an only dog.  If you have a fenced yard then some of her exercise could be met playing in the yard.  She hasn\u2019t had any formal training so she has skills of a younger dog.  Someone willing to teach her the ropes would be great.  She is in Texas and can be adopted locally or we can work with one of the wonderful transporters to deliver her to Washington, Portland, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Vermont or all along the East Coast.  Her adoption fee is 250 and transport is 185.  Rhode Island and Massachusetts are not states we adopt to because of the regulations imposed by these states. \n\nContact Marlene at 210-867-1769 or email to ccpalinquiries@gmail.com if you have questions.

            "description": "Welcome Buddy to CCPAL Rescue.  He is an 8-year old (young acting and looking) Rottie/Chow mix is our best guess.  He has had a home but she has to move to an apartment so she can no longer have any of her dogs.  She has asked CCPAL to step up for Buddy.  He is very attentive, potty trained, good on a leash, fine in a car and has lived with an 8-year-old child for several years.  He is good with another male dog in the home but sometimes this younger energetic dog is irritating to him.  He is loyal and will make a great companion and will be protective.  He is independent enough to do his think and not require too much attention.  He is only moderately active so a walk or two will be sufficient.  He would be perfect for an older couple or single person that would like a nice companion that would be easy and have some skills already.  He is in Texas and can be adopted locally or we can work with one of the transporters to deliver him to Washington, Portland, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Vermont or all along the East Coast.  His adoption fee is 200 and transport is 180.  Rhode Island and Massachusetts are not states we adopt to because of the regulations imposed by these states. \n\nContact Marlene at 210-867-1769 or email to ccpalinquiries@gmail.com if you have questions.

He was hit by a car and then abandoned in a cage for 5 days with no food, water or medical attention.  He had a broken pelvis and needed emergency surgery to amputate his tail.  He had a severe wound on his leg with bone exposed.  After much TLC, Major is on the mend and thriving!\n\nMajor does well in play groups but is a really rough player.  Whether or not he will do well with another dog in the household will be dependent on how they do together.  He has been around cats and has done very well, as long as the kitty doesn't run.  He absolutely loves squeaky toys.  He is crate trained and house trained, but he does excited pee.  \n\nIf you are interested in adopting Major, please email us at therescueboutique@gmail.com",

He has been a good boy since being with his foster parents.  He has done well with potty training.  Bowser likes to burrow under the blankets to sleep.  He gets along with other dogs as he came from a house where his owner died and had 2 other dog siblings.  He is friendly and loves cuddling on your lap.  Since he came from a household with other dogs, he probably would do best in his new home with another dog friend.  Once he gets vetted, he will be ready to go to his new forever home.  \n",

Daisy was wearing a collar but there was neither an id tag nor a dog tag to enable us to locate her owner ... And she was not microchipped.\n\nDaisy has a white short smooth coat with tan markings on her back/hind quarters, a long tail, and a symmetrically-marked face with amber-colored eyes, a liver-colored nose, a slender muzzle, and extra-large erect ears.\n\nDaisy was full of energy when we took preliminary photos as HSOV kennel tech Brad Loyland was taking her back to her kennel after she had enjoyed some fresh air and sunshine on a cool afternoon.  Daisy wasn't ready to pose for boring still-life photos :)\n\nDaisy weighs 37 lbs and is energetic on a leash.\n\nIn compliance with the Ohio Revised Code, Daisy will be held for three days so that her family will have an opportunity to reclaim her with proof of ownership.\n\n",

            "description": "George is a very sweet Hound that just came in as a transfer from county animal control. He stands up on his door and tries to reach through and hug people. He is quiet and loving and no trouble at all. George is guessed to be about 6 years old. He is 46 lbs. He may have been a hunting dog lost during hunting season as he is a bit thin and his skin and fur is beat up. Despite this, he has a wonderful disposition and is happy for any scrap of attention, food, water, or his cot and a toy. Please call (434) 374-8076 or email lakecountryspca@yahoo.com to adopt. Visit LCSPCA Mon-Sat. from 12-4 pm at 11764 Hwy. 15, Clarksville, VA 23927.",

Yesterday he got his neuter and dental surgery, so he is officially ready for a forever family. He does have a heart murmur and the cracking back of an old man, but otherwise, he is healthy and loves to play with other dogs. Isn't he so dapper??? To have your home considered for adoption, read about our adoption process or fees, and find out about interstate transport, please visit our website, www.LongWayHomeAdoptables.org and click the adopt tab!\n\nOur adoption fee is $200 for dogs, $100 for cats, and it includes spay/neuter, all vaccines, heartworm testing, fecal testing, deworming, flea/heartworm prevention, and a microchip. \n\nNATIONWIDE TRANSPORT available for an additional $200 fee. See our website for more info!\n\nPlease note: breed listings are based on educated guesses. Shelter animals and abused pets do not come with DNA profiles, so breeds listed on the profile are based on size, coat, markings, and body shape, but are in no way guaranteed. \n\n_______\n\nLong Way Home is a volunteer organization, comprised of a network of foster homes. Please keep this in mind, as we only have so much time to volunteer around full time jobs, family obligations, etc. It may take us several days to respond.",

            "description": "Don't let this pretty, seemingly innocent face fool you! Two year old Chloe is a bundle of energy! Not a mean bone in her body but quite an exuberant pupper. Belly rubs and petting do settle her, She will settle down in a comfy spot. She's very sweet and affectionate, just hyper. Due to her energy, small children are\u00a0not a good match.\n\nAs for other dogs, she's overwhelming to them. She invades their personal space and has no off button. It's pure play, not aggression, but other dogs do not appreciate it. Chloe would do best as an only dog for this reason. Her dream home is an active one where she can wear herself out productively. Cats are a definite no for all the reasons above.\u00a0\n\n**If you are serious about adopting , you must head to our website at www.kodisclub.org and submit a completed application . We will not do anything without an app. Due to the small size of our volunteer-run rescue, only the approved adopter may be contacted. It is not first come first served, but the best match. Yes, if you are reading this, the dog is available so no need to check **",

His foster family calls him a \"Gentle, quiet, happy\" boy who LOVES stuffed animals and will chew on them gently without tearing them up. He likes to play lazy living room fetch with his stuffies and bring them back to you while you sit on the couch. He LOVES being allowed next to you on the couch to hang out, but will settle for napping on the rug at your feet. He is well-behaved on a leash and around other dogs on walks, and doesn't beg for people food. Prancer would do best in a home where he can be with his people most of the time, as he is a sweet old man who doesn't have fun being left alone. If you are interested in perfect Prancer, please complete a dog adoption survey at la.bestfriends.org/adopt for a team member to reach out to you!",

If they were casting for a dog on a Dove commercial, Duke would be the choice. From any angle, this refined beauty looks like a science experiment on how to create a beautiful, unique breed mix. Almost gray with a warm overtone, his soft and suede-like coat combined with those moonbeam eyeballs that look at you in earnest for some direction, attention and treats. Duke is still in a semi-clumsy puppy body, but he sure wants to please. At only about a year old, Duke is ripe for training and ready to follow-through.\n\nApproved applicants receive priority.\nClick on the \"More About Us\" link to get to our \"Adoption Application\" link.\n\nEmail completed applications to: sandraschiller3008@gmail.com\n",

Homer came into rescue in horrible condition. He had skin issues, was malnourished, and was very shut down. With the love of an amazing foster Mom, Homer has become a healthy, happy guy who is quite the character! Homer LOVES attention from his humans and expects to be pampered. He demands his daily walks, he is wonderful on leash, and loves to eat. Homer gets along with all the dogs in his foster home but can be an only dog that is spoiled and has his new family's full attention. He is house trained and will let you know he wants to go outside by standing by the door. Homer likes to bark at dusk just to make sure his people and property are protected but is otherwise quiet. Homer can be stubborn and would do best with a Pyr experienced owner. He is also very smart and can open gates and doors. He would love a secure yard to lounge in and patrol when the need serves him. Homer is currently in Texas but can be on the next NW transport.\n\nAll our dogs require secure VISIBLE fencing. All current pets in adoptive home must be spayed/neutered and up to date on vaccinations.\n\nAdoption Fee: $350\n\nAll of our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped and up to date on vaccinations.\n\nTransport Fee: $300\n\nTransport fee includes the cost of transport plus the Health Certificate required for USDA approved transport.\n\nAdoption applications can be found on our website: www.greatpyrsandpaws.org\n\nhttps://greatpyrsandpaws.rescuegroups.org/forms/form?formid=5959\n\nNorthwest adopter pays cost of transport to independent transport company.

He is learning manners on a leash, obedience, and other skills that would make him more acceptable for adoption. He can sometimes be mouthy but generally not rough but he does do it frequently when he doesn't get his way. \nWhile Gideon is learning proper dog skills he also is recovering from Demodex mange that had him almost nearly bald but thank goodness he has been treated and had 2 skin scrape tests that have been negative, besides having a beautiful chocolate colored coat grow back in. Gideon does have a few scars from the mange mostly noticeable on his nose and bridge of his muzzle. In addition to coming to rescue with mange, Gideon came with a prior injury to his eye that has left it scarred and uncertain if there is any visual abilities of the eye but it doesn't not seem to slow him down, just cosmetically distracting. We have been told at present time it does not appear as though the eye needs to be removed but can not speak for the future. \nGideon is scheduled in April to be neutered, he is current on vaccines, dewormed, chipped, and heartworm negative. If adopted prior to his neuter date, he will require a spay/neuter contract. If you would like more information or would like to meet him please contact us via email or phone.",

You found me!\n\nI'm a \"perfect angel\" (my foster mom said so!) and I would love a lowkey family to call my own. I love to take naps and cuddle on the couch. I would choose sunbathing in the yard over a walk ANY DAY. I would do best in a home where I don't have to climb too many stairs. \n\nI'm dog-friendly, and I do best with calm dogs who aren't in my face all the time. Any dog who loves to partake in being a snuggle puddle will be my best friend! I haven't been around kids too much, but as long as they are respectful of me I will be just fine. I have some problems with my left eye, so my foster mom gives me drops a few times a day. She says I'm already looking so much better! \n\nWith a great pit bull (that's me!) comes great cuddles. Apply to meet me now!",

At 5 years old and 15 pounds he is an all-around great boy, unless you're a cat or a chicken - his terrier instinct will drive them crazy!  Rocket has everything going for him - he's playful, personable and companionable with people and other dogs.  In fact, he's happiest with a canine companion to pal around with.  We prefer a fenced yard for Rocket so he can explore in a safe environment.  He is a digger but he's not interested in escaping!  Those little moles underground are an amusing pastime for him.  Rocket is housetrained and up to date with vaccinations and will be neutered by this rescue under the NJ low cost spay/neuter program.  If you think your family dynamic is a good match for Rocket, please complete an application at www.pounddogfounddog.org.\n",

We will not respond to petfinder inquiries regarding any information already publicly posted.** Please take time to read the information provided and complete an application if interested.** Incomplete applications will not be considered.**\n\nHi! My name is Jennings! \nI am about 1.5 years old and I weigh around 9 pounds. I am neutered, current on vaccines, microchipped, and on heartworm and flea prevention. I came to my rescue after being abandoned out in the woods with another pup. My foster has worked hard at socializing me as it seems I didn\u2019t have much interaction with people prior to coming to rescue. I will need a quiet, patient home with a physically fenced yard and another confident, like sized pup to play with and show me the ropes. Once I warm up I am the sweetest most cuddly guy and I give lots of kisses! I will require consistent professional grooming. Please list the groomer that you use or intend to use in the, \u201canything else\u201d section of the application. \nMy adoption fee is $425.\n\nPlease submit an application if you want to make me part of your family! \nMeet and greets are scheduled with approved adopters. \nCopy the link below and paste it into your browser for an application:\n\nhttp://www.emailmeform.com/builder/form/wACc22HN2JDb60dtb465Z \n\n\nOur adoption process consists of an application, and reference checks. We do home visits when a reference check is not enough. You must be at least 21 years old to apply to adopt.\nPlease fill out all fields as accurately as possible. We will not process incomplete applications. \n\nAdoptions are made on a best home basis. If two excellent applications come in for the same dog, our policy is first in time, first in line. Our goal is to have the very best home for all our dogs. Our dogs are in private foster homes waiting to be adopted. Due to limited foster space, we are unable to hold an animal to be adopted out at a later time.\n\nPlease keep in mind that we do our best to make an educated guess as to the breeds of our rescued pets. In rescue we rarely see the parents of our dogs and puppies, and even when we do, they are usually mixed breeds as well. \n\nWe rely solely on adoption fees and donations to provide care for our rescued animals, many of whom have incurred medical bills that are much higher than any possible adoption fee. The fees received act to help support the organization as a whole, allowing them to continue efforts to rescue animals from high-kill shelters in South Carolina and Georgia.",

Lucy is working on manners and obedience. She is learning crate training and housebreaking. Lucy is getting better with housebreaking with scheduled feedings and routine outdoor time. Lucy does require crating when not supervised as she will chew on inappropriate items (meaning bedtime and when not home)\nShe does have issues with prey drive and not particularly fond of other dogs but we are trying to work on this issue. She is definitely not recommended with cats, small animals, pocket pets, birds, or livestock. \nLucy has begun vaccinations, she is heart worm negative, she is dewormed, chipped, and awaiting spay. If adopted prior to her spay, she will go out on a spay/neuter contract. \nLucy would thrive in an home that is active and can keep her busy, she still has alot of puppy left in her.",

The nice people  that saved me said I should tell you about myself so I can find my forever home. \n\nI\u2019m estimated at two years old and am a mixed breed boy of about 50 pounds. I am potty trained, neutered and vaccinated. Yay!\n\nI had a very hard first couple of years so I really need a special home. I am a smart boy who craves companionship and am eager to please my people. I absolutely love being part of a pack so my home must have at least one other dog, preferably of similar size or larger. I have a high prey drive so there should be no cats or other small animals in my home. I can also get overly stimulated and forget all my manners sometimes so I need a home without small children. Safety first!!\n\nI need a strong, confident person. I am a very good boy and I really need structure, routine and exercise. \n\nI know my perfect home is out there! If you have no little people or animals in your home, at least one other dog (or two!) and can provide a strong lead and structured life...we could live happily ever after together!!\n\nApply to adopt here: https://www.dogsdeservebetterblueridge.org/adopt",

When he runs, he hops like a kangaroo.  Watch the video and see just how happy Archie is.  This boy loves everyone he meets \u2013 especially children.  He is also good with other dogs and loves to have playtime.  Archie will make a wonderful addition to any family.

            "description": "Quinn was picked up as a stray on a busy 4-lane highway. She was matted, nails were very long and curled, and she had 3 very large masses on her abdomen. Animal control guessed her age at 8 plus. She is a very sweet little girl her loves to snuggle. Our vet also found bladder stones and her teeth are rotten. In addition, she was not spayed. To date, she has been spayed, had the stones removed and had the mass removed from under her front leg which has made it much easier for her to walk as that mass was a cyst that was full of fluid and kept filling up after it was drained several times. A malignant mass was found at the center. It was described as a slow growing mass and was completely excised. Soon she will have the mammary masses removed and will have a dental to address her teeth. She would do best in a quiet home with a family who will love her and take her for walks. She can be a bit bossey if she is hungry and you are too slow. She would also do well with older, calmer children who will be gentle as she only weighs 15 lbs. She is in foster care with other dogs and cats and does quite well. If you are that special family who will give her plenty of love, tlc, and a permanent home, please contact Rainbow Animal Rescue at rainbowanimalrescueva@gmail.com",

She is good with dogs, unsure with cats, and unsure with kids and cant wait to find a family that has other pups to play with. Carin does have year round allergies, they are easily managed though. She has slight anxiety with new places/things and needs a loving family that will give her the support and love she deserves. Carin would do best in a home vs an apartment because she can do an excited bark. \n\nCarin has to find my new forever home because her current owners do not have the ability to provide her with the care or time she needs. \n\nPlease note, Carin is part of Happy Trails Animal Rescues rehoming program. She has not been tested or evaluated and the information gathered is from the current owners personal statements regarding health and temperament. The owner is subject to placement outside of our organization. We cannot guarantee availability.\n\nAdoption requirements are as such:\n\n\n\tNo apartments \n\tAnother dog friend",

            "description": "Holly is a stunning 1 year old, 45 lb Husky pup. Her previous foster mom states that she is very sweet and loves kids. Holly was around children that were 16 months and 4 years old and did wonderfully. Holly walks nicely on leash. She gets along with all sized dogs and prefers to live in a cat free zone. Shes curious of all the scents on her walks, loves to be outside in the fresh air and loves to run around in the play yard. Were working on sit and down and shes doing very well. Holly would love to have a big 6 foot fenced yard to spend time in. She did remarkably well with house training and made a mild fuss with the kennel but respected it. She is a typical husky that would make a great jogging partner. She just finished training with Second Chance Pups. Come visit with her and youll see how special she is.\n\nThe adoption fee is $300 and covers age appropriate vaccines, a microchip, and a spay/neuter.\n\n Applications are typically worked in time stamp order based on date/time of submission. If you have other dogs in your home, they must all meet the potential adoptee. It may save you a trip to bring them with you when you visit, if you are certain you want to adopt a new family member. \n\n*****We are currently operating by appointment only during the social distancing stage of quarantine. If you want to meet this pet, or are interested in adopting, please submit an inquiry or email to email@townandcountryhumanesociety.org.\n\nSomeone from the rescue will contact you and/or your family and determine, on a broad level, whether you might be a fit for the animal. If so, they will provide instructions for completing the application. Your application will be reviewed and you will be contacted to set up a time to meet at the shelter or the foster home. The introduction between you and the pet will be supervised by one of the dog counselors or the foster. If all goes well, you can adopt during the same visit.\n\nPlease be sure to follow us on Facebook to learn more about Town and Country Humane Society and our mission.",

Once approved you will be called for an appointment to meet your possible new family member, or at that time you can meet the other animals as well. https://petstablished.com/public/search/shelter/301551\n\nAdoption fee is $150 which includes, spay/neuter, vaccines, etc, and a free 1 year membership to our 5 acre ARF Park. For other dog questions please email ARFdogs74006@gmail.com\n\nWe do adopt out of state, but the adopter must travel to ARF to meet the dog they are looking to adopt. They must have an approved application before traveling to meet the dog. We do allow small dogs that are eligible to fly in the cabin of a plane. We DO NOT allow dogs to travel in the cargo area of the plane under any circumstances. Any dog that is adopted can of course go by personal vehicle. We do not allow dogs to be transported \"pony express style\" where they are passed from driver to driver.",

Toffee is housebroken, great with children, cats and other dogs.\n\nFill out an application at the link below. Find the dog/cat you are interested in and click the adopt button. That will take you to an application. Once approved you will be called for an appointment to meet your possible new family member, or at that time you can meet the other animals as well. https://petstablished.com/public/search/shelter/301551\n\nAdoption fee is $150 which includes, spay/neuter, vaccines, etc, and a free 1 year membership to our 5 acre ARF Park. For other dog questions please email ARFdogs74006@gmail.com\n\nWe do adopt out of state, but the adopter must travel to ARF to meet the dog they are looking to adopt. They must have an approved application before traveling to meet the dog. We do allow small dogs that are eligible to fly in the cabin of a plane. We DO NOT allow dogs to travel in the cargo area of the plane under any circumstances. Any dog that is adopted can of course go by personal vehicle. We do not allow dogs to be transported \"pony express style\" where they are passed from driver to driver.",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Lala. I am an adorable medium sized young dog weighing in at about 30 pounds. I've been told that I'm a super sweet girl. In fact, I can be a total lap dog! But mostly I am an active working breed dog and likely more blue heeler than not which means I am smart, active, and able to think on my own. I enjoy playing with toys and with other dogs but my sense of personal space is not that great. If you're interested in someone who is sweet, sassy, adorable, and fun - I might be the girl for you! I must have a home with a fenced yard, another dog-friendly-dog would be ideal, and an experienced dog owner with time to spend on me. Older children, over the age of 10 should be fine, as the smaller oneswell they are way too fun to herd. Cats are fun to herd, too.\n\n \n\nTo adopt Lala visit our website for more details regarding our adoption criteria and complete the easy online no obligation adoption application at www.dsda.org/adopt. \n\n* Adoption Fees:\n\nPuppies (12 months and under) - $325 (includes tax)\n\nDogs (over 12 months) - $275 (includes tax) \n\n \n\nQualifications for Adoption: No dog is alike and each dog has different requirements based on breed, age, energy level and life experiences. DSDA is very careful to place our dogs in homes that we believe are the best fit for the dog based on our experience with each dog. All of our dogs live in foster homes which allows us the opportunity to learn about their individual needs. \n\n\n\tMust be 21 years or older with identification showing present address.\n\tMust have the knowledge and consent of all adults living in the household.\n\tVet checks are required. All resident animals must be spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccinations and on monthly heartworm and flea/tick preventative (if applicable).\n\tMust receive proof of pet deposit and lease allowing pets if renting.\n\tWillingness and capacity to spend the time and money necessary to provide training, medical treatment and responsible care for a pet.\n\tApplicant is home more than not.\n\tAny poisonous plants must be removed from the yard before the home visit.\n\tHome visit is required. For this reason, we adopt locally in the Dallas and immediate surrounding areas.",

This is all the information we have currently.\n\nHW+ simply means the dog has tested positive for heart worms in our screening process. We utilize what is called the fast-kill method which means we place the dog on antibiotics for 30 days and then administer 3 injections in increments afterward. The cost to treat heart worms is rather steep. However, thanks to our generous donors, we are able to cover that cost for our adopters so long as they go to our veterinarian, Red Rocks Animal Center in Lakewood.\n\n\n\tApproved Applicants may make the adoption fee payment by clicking donate above. Partial adoption fees will not hold a dog.\n\tDogs adopted with our rescue come with FREE training from #GoodPup to help you build strong bonds from the start!\n\tIf upon meeting the dog of your choosing at an adoption event you find that you aren't a good match, your deposit will be refunded minus a 10% administration fee.\n\tAdoption fees include vaccines up until time of adoption, microchip, spay/neuter and 1st 30 days of free Pet insurance. We are not affiliated with Pet First pet insurance. (you have to sign up for the insurance or it will not go into effect). \n\tAdopters can go to our vet for medical issues that may arise in 1st 3 days of adoption. \n\tThe dogs in our care are fostered in Colorado, Texas, and New Mexico.

We will not respond to petfinder inquiries regarding any information already publicly posted.** Please take time to read the information provided and complete an application if interested.** Incomplete applications will not be considered.**\n\nHi! My name is Herbert! \nI am about 13 years old and I weigh around 12 pounds. I am neutered, current on vaccines, microchipped, and on heartworm and flea prevention. My foster mom says I am the most well mannered of pups and an easy guy to have around! I love to cuddle and have great appreciation for a soft bed and fuzzy blankets! \nMy adoption fee is $325. \n\n*Herbert is eligible for our seniors program. Our Seniors for Seniors Program offers senior citizens 65 years or older the opportunity to adopt a senior dog at a reduced adoption fee. Adoption application and screening still apply.* \n\nPlease submit an application if you want to make me part of your family! \nMeet and greets are scheduled with approved adopters. \nCopy the link below and paste it into your browser for an application:\n\nhttp://www.emailmeform.com/builder/form/wACc22HN2JDb60dtb465Z \n\n\nOur adoption process consists of an application, and reference checks. We do home visits when a reference check is not enough. You must be at least 21 years old to apply to adopt.\nPlease fill out all fields as accurately as possible. We will not process incomplete applications. \n\nAdoptions are made on a best home basis. If two excellent applications come in for the same dog, our policy is first in time, first in line. Our goal is to have the very best home for all our dogs. Our dogs are in private foster homes waiting to be adopted. Due to limited foster space, we are unable to hold an animal to be adopted out at a later time.\n\nPlease keep in mind that we do our best to make an educated guess as to the breeds of our rescued pets. In rescue we rarely see the parents of our dogs and puppies, and even when we do, they are usually mixed breeds as well. \n\nWe rely solely on adoption fees and donations to provide care for our rescued animals, many of whom have incurred medical bills that are much higher than any possible adoption fee. The fees received act to help support the organization as a whole, allowing them to continue efforts to rescue animals from high-kill shelters in South Carolina and Georgia.",

He is good on a leash and would do just about anything for a treat or a tennis ball. Beethoven is deaf but that doesn't slow him down. If anything he is more attentive than hearing dogs because he looks to his person for direction. Beethoven knows sign language and is a velcro dog: wherever his person is, that is where he wants to be. Beethoven loves the water and will spend hours splashing in a baby pool. This sweet guy would make a great running buddy or agility dog. Beethoven would prefer to be the only 4 legged member of your family! His favorite spot is on the couch..... UNDER the blankets! Looking for a couch buddy??? Apply to adopt Beethoven today!\nBeethoven is neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccinations, microchipped and heartworm tested and on preventative. His adoption fee is $175.\nTo apply to adopt Beethoven, visit www.adoptapitrescue.org/apply\nAll of our dogs are spayed or neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccinations, microchipped and if over 6 months of age, heartworm tested and on heartworm preventative in their foster home.\n\nWe require an approved application to meet any of our dogs. We do not have a shelter location and will not arrange a meeting without an approved application.\n\nWe strive to make sure the bios provided for our dogs are complete and accurate; we do understand that mistakes happen, however, so if you absolutely cannot find the answer to your question in the dog's bio, you can contact us for more information.\n\nWe require a home visit for each dog we adopt out, so we adopt within a 2 hour radius of Dayton, OH. If you are outside of this radius, we encourage you to contact your local rescue or shelter.",

She prefers male dogs and doesn\u2019t like girls much. She growls at the girls ! Hence she needs to go to a home with another male dog or as an only dog with someone who is active. \nLayla is about 2-3 years old. She came to us with a painful damaged eye that had to be removed. She so much happier not being in pain. \nShe does have some reactivity around her collar and with mouth if grabbed. We are working on this and is improving. \nIf you may be interested in Layla please go to our  website - www.LunaSiberianRescue.dog and fill out the online application.",

She likes to take things slow and get to know you before she lets you in, but is so lovable and affectionate when she does! She loves to play with toys, and will carry around her favorites! There hasn't been much structure in her life and she needs some help learning the basics still, like housebreaking and leash walking, but she is very eager to please! She's been happy to welcome her human friends into her kennel for cuddles or tug-o-war. She wants to be the queen of the castle as an only pet in her new home, soaking up all the love. \n\nKey Notes:\n-2 year old spayed female.\n-Pit bull terrier mix.\n-65 pounds and a healthy weight.\n-Brought to animal control when found as a local stray.\n-No apartment style or multi-family homes, city living, or busy/loud neighborhoods.\n-Has not been around kids yet, but should not live with any younger than 12.\n-Should be an only pet.\n-No more than 5 hours alone a day; will need a potty and play break.\n-Experience with dogs recommended.\n-Medium energy; loves to play with her toys and also loves snuggling and pets.\n-Not yet housebroken.\n-Walks well on leash, but can be strong.\n-Shy at first, especially with men, but warms up quickly and is very loving.\n-Basic obedience training recommended.\n\n--THE ADOPTION PROCESS--\nIf you are interested in adopting this animal, please submit an online application. Applications will be reviewed as received. If in our opinion a pet is a good candidate for you, an adoption\u00a0counselor will contact you to schedule a zoom chat. If you do not hear from us it simply means either the animal has been adopted or we have not received the right pet for you. The application process is at no charge to you and only needs to be completed once as all applications will be kept on file.\n\nOnline applications can be found here: www.buddydoghs.com/forms\n\nCheck out our FAQ for answers to most questions here: www.buddydoghs.com/faq\n\nAdopters must be at least 21 years of age and a Massachusetts resident.",

This chapter receives only applications from applicants living in Texas and Oklahoma. If you live outside of TX or OK, you will need to contact our organizations Management Team first: managementteam2@yahoo.com. Out-of-state adoptions are considered on a case-by-case basis.\n\nOur organization requires prospective adopters to complete an approval process prior to meeting with dogs in our program. This includes:\n*Completion of Adoption Application\n*Veterinarian Check\n*Reference Checks (non-relatives)\n*Home Visit\n\nOur ultimate goal is to screen and counsel potential homes to the best of our ability in an effort to find the most perfect match and fit for their lifestyle.\n\nPlease keep in mind that color and appearance of the available dog is last on our priority list, and will have no bearing on adoption placement decisions.\n\nPlease refrain from contacting members of our organization or asking about specific dogs/potential matches until after your screening process has been completed and approved.\n\n***$300 Adoption Fee + state-required tax.***\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT ROGAN\nRep: Laura - aussie330@aol.com\n\n\nRogan is an approximately 1.5yo Aussie that came to us from a shelter after he was picked up as a stray and never reclaimed. He is fully-vetted, house-trained, crate-trained, and does well on a leash.  He is currently located in Bedford, TX and it is required that you travel there to meet him in person to adopt, no exceptions. We do need the entire party to be involved when meeting available dogs, including every family member and dog(s) that currently live in your home.\n\nRogan is still very new to our program, but so far, he has been a very sweet and intelligent boy.  He does have some uncertainties that make him a big anxious, so a home with children is best.  He does great with other dogs and bonds deeply to \"his\" people.  He also had a cat-test where he showed a bit too much interest, so a home without cats would be best.\n\nPlease check back as we get to know him more!",

Landru is a big goofy sweetheart who loves to snuggle and love on his people and has a wonderfully loving personality. Landru is friendly with new people, gets along great with the other dogs in his foster home and doesn't bother their dog savvy cat too much (any cats in the home should be used to living with dogs). Landru is a very affectionate boy who has great in home manners, is house broken, walks well on the leash and does well in the crate if needed. \n\nWe will be looking for a home for Landru who has experience with Great Danes and/or Giant Breed dogs (i.e. dog breeds over 100 pounds at a healthy weight). Landru is the second Great Dane we have rescued from the same household with 6 children plus neighborhood children frequenting the home. Expectatiins of Landru and the other Great Dane (already adopted) were unrealistic and we don't want to put Landru back in a home with young children (12+ is ok but must be experienced and respectful with dogs). We don't want to put him back in a situation that he's uncomfortable with. We will be seeking a calm environment for Landru. \n\n$250 Adoption Fee.\n\nA $10.00 non-refundable application fee is required to submit your adoption application and will be deducted from your adoption fee if you adopt.\n\nAll Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue dogs are spayed/neutered, current on vaccinations, heartworm tested, current on heartworm and flea prevention, and microchipped.\n\nAlong with other criteria evaluated in the adoption application, a Fenced Yard is required to adopt. \n\nPlease see our Fenced Yard Requirements tab on our website for more information, here:\nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/fenced-yard-requirements/\n\nOur adoption area, unless otherwise specified in their bio, is within a two hour radius of Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue for adult dogs, and within a one hour radius for puppies. \n\nPlease see our Adoption Radius tab on our website for more info, here:\nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/adoption-radius/\n\nTO CHECK AVAILABILITY of any of our adoptable animals, please go to our available pets tab, here: https://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/available-pets-for-adoption/\n\nAll pets listed here are updated regularly to reflect their availability.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR PEPPERMINT PIG ANIMAL RESCUE:\n\nBefore completing the application, please read our ADOPTION PROCESS tab on our website, here: \nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/how-our-adoptions-work/\n\nTo complete our easy online adoption application, please visit our website at PeppermintPigAnimalRescue.org.\n\nAll adoption information and applications can be found under the ADOPTION CENTER tab.\n\nAdoption events are held every Saturday in our thrift store from 1:00pm to 4:00pm.

This giant German chocolate boy was found roaming a park with other pups and eventually someone realized he had no human with him. He was picked up and when no one came forward to claim him, he came to Buddy Dog to find his furever home! There's no mistaking the shepherd in this boy; he walks, talks, and thinks just like one. He needs a family who can keep up with him. He's a fast thinker and is easily stressed if not properly entertained. While he has not yet learned his manners, he is a friendly boy who greets everyone by jumping up to sniff their face, and he is big enough to reach! His misbehaviors, like jumping and play biting, worsen when stressed. Plenty of exercise, training, and playtime is needed to keep this boy happy and on the path to a being a polite pup. He overwhelms most dogs as he likes to \"tackle first, greet later\" and doesn't understand that not all dogs want to play with him. He would do best as an only pet until he learns boundaries and will take \"no\" for an answer.\n\nKey Notes:\n-2-year old neutered male.\n-German shepherd dog and husky/malamute mix.\n-74 pounds and underweight.\n-Brought to animal control when found as a local stray.\n-Experience with dogs needed; experience with active and intelligent breeds recommended.\n-No apartment style homes, small homes, or city living. A large fenced-in yard is ideal.\n-Needs and adult only (18+) home.\n-Should not live with other animals; could eventually live with another dog after he's had training to learn manners and boundaries.\n-No more than 6 hours alone a day; will need a potty and play break.\n-Basic obedience training required; would thrive with more advanced training.\n-High energy; needs lots of mental and physical stimulation daily.\n-Almost housebroken.\n-Very strong on leash; still strong but better with a no-pull harness; best on a head collar but still training.\n-Jumps up and playfully chews on people.\n-Food motivated; knows \"sit\" and \"paw\".\n-Enjoys playtime with sturdy dogs closer to his size who don't also do not have boundaries.\n\n--THE ADOPTION PROCESS--\nIf you are interested in adopting this animal, please submit an online application. Applications will be reviewed as received. If in our opinion a pet is a good candidate for you, an adoption\u00a0counselor will contact you to schedule a zoom chat. If you do not hear from us it simply means either the animal has been adopted or we have not received the right pet for you. The application process is at no charge to you and only needs to be completed once as all applications will be kept on file.\n\nOnline applications can be found here: www.buddydoghs.com/forms\n\nCheck out our FAQ for answers to most questions here: www.buddydoghs.com/faq\n\nAdopters must be at least 21 years of age and a Massachusetts resident.",

I did well with my finders small dog, but it is unknown how I do with larger dogs or cats. I am looking for a home without young children as they make me nervous. I am currently staying offsite to receive some extra love and training. I would love to show you all the new tricks I'm learning, so come meet me! *Please apply on our website at indy.gov/activity/adopt-a-pet. Go to the website, click on the adoption application link, enter the information and hit submit. After the application is submitted a staff member will contact you within 48 hours.

She's people-oriented and mostly kept to herself in the yard, but she engaged in a bit of play and seems to enjoy the company of other dogs. Staffers say she's an easygoing and sweet girl. Daisy walks well on a leash and would do best in a home with a secure, fenced yard. If you think Daisy would make a great addition to your home, make an appointment to meet her today! PUPDATE: Daisy was recently adopted for a brief period and we learned that she will do best in a home without cats. She was also housebroken and quickly caught on to a potty schedule, and did fine with an infant in the home, not paying much attention at all.",

            "description": "Suki is a big boy. He is about 90 lbs. He is so cute and has such a sweet goofy face . He\u2019s mostly a mush although he does have some collar reactivity if someone were to grab him forcefully. He is a pretty good listener and he knows how to sit and wait. He does jump up sometimes which this command is a work in progress. He\u2019s a big brute and a teddy bear too. He loves to cuddle , thinks he\u2019s a lap dog , loves to give you a hug \u201cslurp\u201d in the face occasionally. When your dad and if you cry , he wants to be right on you and kissing your face. He gets very concerned. We have had Suki for 2 years . He came to us with a broken leg . He was rescued by animal control and taken from his previous  owners for neglect . His leg healed perfectly but we as a rescue made a mistake on handling him in the very beginning. Being he wasn\u2019t a behavior dog , and was just medical , one of our rescue partners grabbed his collar to get him into his crate,  and he freaked out and snapped at her face. Being that she has a of short stature he bit her top lip and nose and she had to have many sutures. We have now had him over 2 years and never had there been an incident again. He has never bitten anyone. Our friends come over and he jumps up and gives kisses. We made a mistake in the way we handled him when we first got him , but he has shown us over and over that this is not who he is. He was scared and hurting with his broken leg and reacted,  but he has never had any issue again. We know this may dissuade you from adopting and that\u2019s ok. We are a full disclosure Rescue. We want Suki to be in a home that\u2019s perfect for him. We think Suki would even be great with kids but we can\u2019t adopt him to a home unless children are grown. My 9 year old niece lived with us a while and he was great to her, but that\u2019s our rules, an adult home. If you\u2019re young and newly married and starting a family ,a different dog might suit you better. \nIf your the perfect person for Suki you will understand the things I am saying and be mesmerized by his adorable \u201cScooby Doo\u201d face and googly eyes. He\u2019s such a happy boy and so deserving of a wonderful family who can pay more time and attention to this doll! He is great with other dogs. He does get nervous and uptight sometimes but we have a whole pack of huskies and they are overwhelming sometimes. \nIf you may be interested in Suki and you meet the qualifications, you can go to Www. LunaSiberianRescue.Dog and fill out the online application. \n",

I need a fully fenced yard as my breed can be pesky about listening when it\u2019s time to come inside LOL \n\nThe adoption donation fee is $500 which is tax-deductible and goes towards the care of homeless pets with Pals for Paws. \n\nTo expedite the adoption process you can fill out an application online at www.palsforpawsinc.com/adopt.

            "description": "Ralph was returned today because he is territorial. Ralph loved the dog he lived with and he did well at the dog park. He is very protective of his home and when on a leash protective of his family with other dogs. This is something that can be fixed with appropriate training. Training sessions with an appropriate trainer will come with Ralph. Ralph is great with people but does not care for cats. Ralph is 2 years old. When Ralph first came to us he was vomiting quite a bit.  We took him to the vet where they discovered that Ralph swallowed a string that got wrapped around the back of his tongue and went down into his stomach and started to grow into the stomach lining. He went through surgery \nto have that removed.\n\nThe dog adoption application is located here:\nhttps://form.jotform.com/31997643682166\n\nThis dog is at the Granite City Animal Control in Madison County, Illinois. \n\n\n\nOur Adoption Process: \n*You must complete an adoption application before meeting an animal.\n*We do all checks on references and vet checks.  \n*Please let your references know we will be calling. \n*Once approved, you can set up an appointment to meet any of the animals at the Granite City Animal Control, or the ones in foster homes. \n*There will be a meet and greet and then a home visit.\n*After that you will sign an adoption contract and pay the adoption fee.  \n\n$85 for Rabbits / $80 for Cats / $100 Kittens / $150 for Dogs / $200 for Puppies Six Months & Under\n\nThe dog adoption application is located here:\nhttps://form.jotform.com/31997643682166\n\nAll our animals are completely vetted with the required vaccinations, microchipped and spayed/neutered before leaving the rescue. \nIncluding: \nCats will have FIV/FeLV testing\nDogs will have Heartworm testing\nRabbits will have a wellness check \n\n______________________________________________________________\n\n\nMany times we also get feral cats or semi-friendly cats (can be petted but doesn't like to be held) needing barn homes. You will need to provide shelter and food. There are not any adoption fees for barn cats (donations are accepted) but you will still need to fill out the cat adoption form. Just list the number of barn cats you are wanting.  \n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nWe are a small foster based rescue but some of our animals are residing at the Granite City Animal Control in Madison County, Illinois until they can be adopted, fostered or pulled by another rescue. \n\nPound Pets Inc Rescue can always use more fosters.\nIf you are interested in fostering, the foster application is located here:\n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/50784968756173\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nPound Pets volunteers cleans the animal control building, we are the caregivers for the animals brought in. Once they come through the door, they become our responsibility. We photograph all animals and post to the Pound Pets Facebook page. We provide them clean kennels, beds, blankets, toys, treats, outside play time, walks and human interaction. We try to comfort the scared, keep the high-energy ones exercised and provide plenty of love and affection to make their time at animal control as less stressful as possible. \n\nSometimes they get reclaimed by their families and sometimes they don't. If they don't it is our responsibility to find the adopters, fosters or rescues to save them from euthanasia. \n\nWe get in sick and injured animals as well. They do not sit in their kennels or cages needing veterinary care. Once we see the need for care they are taken to the vet. Sometimes the illness or injury is minor and the city will cover the bill, Other times when it's not, we do. We do all of this on our own dime. We buy the food, the beds, the blankets, the toys, and all the other things that go into care for the animals. Sometimes things are donated and that is wonderful!! We pay the medical bills that the city doesn't. As with most animal controls, there is a limit on what they will do or cover. At Pound Pets, there is no limit. Broken Bones, Surgery, Parvo, Heartworm, etc., if the animal has a chance the animal is given that chance. This is not a shelter but an animal control. \n\nPound Pets Inc Rescue can always use more volunteers.\nIf you are interested in volunteering, the volunteer application is located here:\n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/40307066949156\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nWe are always looking for licensed rescues to pull cats (including FIV+ cats) and dogs from the Granite City Animal Control in Madison County, Illinois. It's a very small animal control and strays keep coming in.  There are no fees for a rescue to pull. If you can help us, please email the volunteers at poundpetsinc@gmail.com \n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nPound Pets Inc Animal Control Facebook Page:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/poundpetsincorporated/\n\nPound Pets Inc Rescue Facebook Page:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/poundpetsincrescue/",

Though she loves to play with Barney in the big field, she needs the opportunity to come inside and spend time with her people.\n\nShe has worked with our trainer and shows great promise. She learns quickly and is going to make a fantastic companion. \n\nIf you would like to apply for this darling girl, please visit our website for an application. ?????\n\nHttps://pawsofchinook.rescuegroups.org",

She was an owner surrender who spent all her life in a backyard with three other German Shepherds. As a result, she had no knowledge of indoors or walks outside her yard. She has been picking up the indoor life quite well. She learned the stairs within a few days, and with only one accident, she now appears to be housebroken, with the use of a dog door. She is also learning how to go on walks and she walks calmly next to her human. She will go into a crate, but it is not her favorite thing, however, she does get crated when the family is out and she has been fine. Kyda sleeps in the bedroom with her foster parents.\n\nKyda is very uncertain of new humans initially, men more than women. She shies away from big arm/hand movements, but when she gets to know you, she is very affectionate. Kyda is a very sweet girl and takes instruction quite well.  She will be an easy dog to train. She shares the foster home with another German Shepherd alum of GCGSR and does well with her.\n\nKyda is currently overweight and is on a weight reduction regime. This includes daily walks and two smaller meals a day. Although she is large, she is a slow, picky eater.  \n\nCats & small critters unknown.\n\nThis dog is a Level 2. Please be sure you understand what a dog of this Level requires. Go to our home page for an explanation of the Dog Rating Levels.\n\nFor more information and to see when this dog will be attending an Adoption Day, please see our Dogs page on our main website at www.gcgsr.org. \n\nWe operate within a reasonable driving distance from the Greater Sacramento area, the \tCentral Valley down to Merced, and Lake Tahoe. A reasonable driving distance is determined by where one of our volunteers is willing to drive within our areas of service. That means we don't adopt out of our area, to Southern California, or Out of State. \n\n\nThank you for visiting!",

Who could shoot a 2 year old pup?!?! \n\nLenny is an easy-going, docile and smart boy. He LOVES people (velcro dog!), loves to cuddle, loves to please and loves calm interaction! A quiet home with older kids may be best since he seems to thrive best in a calm environment. \nYou can tell he is a bit shy from what has happened to him, but he is also curious, very sweet and very smart- is even learning new commands!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Cliff, please apply at www.twotailzrescue.org!",

Both can be found under the Adopt menu item on the website. A veterinarian evaluates all dogs taken in by Mo-Kan Border Collie Rescue . All required shots are administered; checked for intestinal parasites; heart worms and they are spayed/neutered.\n\nDogs on the Sponsorship page may or may not be available for adoption yet, but can be Sponsored. Read more under the We Need You menu item on the website.\n\nCourtesy Listings have not been evaluated by MoKanBCR. Please refer to the contact info in the bio.\nHope is an approximately 5 year old border collie or Australian shepherd mix as best as we can tell! Hope came to us extremely under socialized and terrified of people. Her initial reaction was to bolt if possible and flatten herself to the ground or floor if she had nowhere to run. Hope also came into rescue very pregnant and raised five adorable puppies in her foster home.\n\nHope has come a long way since arriving in rescue. She has progressed from needing to be taken out on a long line and harness in a fenced yard to being able to go in and out with the other dogs without issue. She enjoys being around her foster family and will often follow them from room to room during the day but she is not yet to the point of enjoying a lot of petting or cuddles. She will let us walk up to her in the house or yard (usually) and pet her or put a leash on her but she does not really come up to us and seek attention. She is getting less picky about treats and has taken a definite interest in \"snack time\" in her foster home. She really enjoys playing with her foster brothers but also doesn't mind living with dogs who don't want to play. She enjoys rawhide strips and nylabones but does not yet play with toys. She likes dogs beds and would be happy to hang out on the couch if we let her! Hope is good with cats as well as other animals.\n\nHope walks quietly on a leash but but does still get startled and may balk or spook at times. She is housebroken and crate trained. She is getting better about being led by the collar and nail trims. Things like being picked up or bathing or being restrained can still cause her to panic some but I expect her to continue to make progress.\n\nHope is about 36 lbs but short and stocky. Radiographically, Hope has significant hip dysplasia. While she currently has no clinical signs she could benefit from joint supplements or joint diets and may need additional medication or therapy in the future. Maintaining a lean weight will be important for her.\n\nHope requires a secure, standard above ground fence. She should still be considered a flight risk, especially in a new environment. Her new family will need to leash walk her even in the fenced yard until she reliably can be caught or defaults to returning to the house when startled or is done being outside. She is a low energy dog who has potential to be a nice companion or walking partner. Young children are not recommended at this time as they could be scary to her.\n\nHope is being fostered in the Ozark, Mo area.Click here to watch a video of Hope. 2/2/21 11:17 AM",

Logan is a laid back, easy going boy who likes to chill with his people. An evening stroll with his best friends is enough activity for this couch potato but a hike in the woods or jogging trail is great, too. He is an outdoorsy guy.\n\nLogan has been friendly towards his foster family, all the adoption center staff love him, and anyone else he has met along the way. Logan has done well and been friendly with dogs and cats he has met.\n\nHe rides very well in the car and loves to go anywhere he can. He walks well on a leash, he is crate trained, house trained, and has started basic training. He would love a family to call his own. His ideal home should have another laid back dog and a fenced yard.\n\nThe adoption fee for Logan is $250. He is neutered, up-to-date on vaccines, deworming, heartworm prevention, flea/tick prevention, and microchip. Will you be his buddy? Logan currently lives in Rutherford County, NC.

Breezy is a low to medium energy girl who enjoys a stroll around the block and a ride in the car with her friends. She has good manners and is just plain fun. With people, she is a submissive girl, who does best with gentle training and correction. She always wants to please!\n\nBreezy has a goofy smile when she is happy. She is a great pet for the right someone, but she is not your fist dog. She needs a loving owner experienced with her breed.\n\nBreezy arrived at Lee Shore with 8 tiny puppies and has done a good job of raising them. Now it is her turn to find that special home. Could it be yours?\n\nShe has been friendly towards her foster family and people she has met. Breezy can get along well with other dogs, and enjoys playing. However she is selective and also needs a slow warm-up to new dogs. Her play style is enthusiastic, so her playmate needs to be another strong dog. She should not be around small dogs or cats. She would not mind being the center of attention in a single dog home either!\n\nBreezy can be protective of her people and of herself if there are strange dogs. Her desired home has loving people who will let her be the couch potato of her dreams, has a covered outdoor kennel run, and people who will keep her on a leash, in the house or out for air in a covered run.\n\nBreezy is house trained, crate trained, and leash trained. She has knows basic obedience training. Breezy is spayed and up to date on vaccinations, deworming, and flea/tick meds. Breezy was heart worm positive and has had treatment. The adoption fee for Breezy is $250.\n\nTo adopt this loving girl, please go to\nhttps://www.leeshorerescue.com/apply.html\nand fill out an application today!",

She is a happy healthy 6 month old pup who has not let her rough start in life get to her. She will need lots of exercise, so if you need a running buddy Jovie is your girl. She is ready for adoption today.\n\nPlease contact Andrea @ andrea@oglalapetproject.org for an adoption application. Adoption fee is $200. Adoption applications are processed by OPP volunteers, since we do not have a shelter facility we check references and meet with you in your home to discuss the pet you are interested in adopting. The adoption fee for all OPP dogs/puppies is $200 which includes vaccinations, dewormer, flea/tick treatment and spay/neuter surgery - and in many cases we've treated the pet for much more if it arrives to OPP ill or injured. Our adoption fee helps cover to cover some of these costs - adopters are welcome to make an additional donation to the program at the time of adoption so we can continue to help other unwanted pets on Pine Ridge.\n\nVisit us on Facebook to learn more about our work facebook.com/OglalaPetProject Thank you for choosing to adopt a rescued animal!",

He's very sweet and would enjoy having at least one dog in the home to help keep him company and help show him the perks of family life!\n\nHank's adoption fee is $225 plus tax and that covers his vaccinations, microchip, neuter and he's on heartworm prevention.

            "description": "Age:5\nWeight: 125\nLocation: New Britain, CT\nNicknames: Maximus, Lil' Bit, Bubba\nGood with other dogs?: Dog selective.\nIn his previous home, Max lived with three other dogs who were a but smaller than him. I mean, how couldn't they be? Max used to weigh 144.6 pounds! They ate together and played hard together as Max was described as being the most submissive of the four. He came to us with lots of scabs and scrapes which have since healed up. He is happy to see other dogs on walks and wants to play. We are working on introducing him to his foster pack this week.\nGood with cats? other: He is interested but isn't quick enough to catch our cat.\nGood with children? unknown, will not be adopted to a home with kids under 10\nActivity Preference: Needs a couple walks a day.\nIQ: Smart\nMax's favorite things: Max loves his stuffed toys. He definitely uses them to self-sooth. They last awhile until they die a very fluffy death. He likes a walk around the neighborhood and always needs to say hi to folks, so be ready to meet some new neighbors. He is highly motivated by treats due to his extreme and necessary diet.\n\nMax likes neck scratches and belly rubs and body hugs. But he does not like kisses on his nose at all. It makes him nervous. You can kiss the top of his head if you must.\n\nHe also likes to play ball. He loves a tennis ball which was his reward for hitting his first weight loss goal!\nMax is good at: meeting people, behaving in the house, going for car rides, making me feel safe, walking on a leash, playing, following commands, other: Taking treats gently\nIdeal home: someone at home most of the day, other: Someone who understands dog body language\nTraining Needs: socialization with dogs\nHealth issues: Max came to us in an extremely obese state. We are working very hard to get him to a healthy weight and Max is making great progress. Due to his natural size (he should probably be anywhere from 95-115lbs) it is important that his forever home recognize that he stay trim for his overall health. His energy and happiness have increased dramatically now that he is more than 15 pounds lighter in his first month with us.\n\nMeet Max\n\nI'm sure you're familiar with Grumpy Cat. And it could be that Max is related. But don't let his resting frowny face fool you. Max smiles all the time now. Except when I'm trying to get cute photos of him ;)\n\nMax had a really tough start. And we mean really. He was found tied to a poll covered in blood at a young age. A very nice woman took him in and worked with him to get him to trust people again. Max lived with three other dogs who were described as fairly dominant. Max was apparently the submissive one of the group. They were provided with food all the time and we think Max ate his feelings.\n\nMax came to us severely overweight. His long-term foster mom had to move and made the tough choice to give Max a chance at a better home where he could get more attention than her schedule would allow. Tipping the scales at more than 144 pounds, we had to get him to a healthy weight pronto. Max had a tough transition into our house, doing a lot of crying for his lost life. We have never experienced that kind of sadness from a foster and it was heartbreaking to watch. But having been with us for a month now, he is much happier and loves attention and playtime.\n\nMax is perfectly house trained. He will do his business on walks or in the back yard. And he is a pretty easy walker. He takes his harness like a champ and learned the route very quickly. He will let you know if he wants a long or short walk.\n\nMax lets us know when Amazon is here to make a delivery but other than that, he only barks when he really needs to go outside or when one of his toy is stuck. He is completely non-destructive and has not been crated due to his size and initial anxiety. He has his own open space in our home and has been a gentleman. Max joins us downstairs during our Peloton rides. I think he wonders why we are doing all that work, but he keeps us safe while we get our sweat on.\n\nMax loves to have someone by his side. It is when he relaxes the most. However, he is still wary at times, giving me the side eye. He does not like to be kissed on the face therefore, small kids are probably not a good fit for Max. He takes kisses on his head and lets us hug his around his body. He likes neck scratches and will lean into them. When he is comfortable with you, you'll know because he will finally give you his belly. And that is huge and so rewarding. He loves playing with his toys and showing them to you; that is when you will get the biggest smile. Max knows how to sit and shake with both paws. I'm sure he can learn even more tricks. He also likes a car ride.\n\nMax is at the point now where we can tell he wants to be integrated with our group. We have six personal dogs who are all seniors and super seniors. We will be working on introducing him this week to see how it goes with dogs of different sizes.\n\nAnyone interested in Max will get a very easy going dog once he settles into your home. It is important to give him time to adjust. This could take two full weeks or more. But given our experience, it is quite possible that he won't fully blossom until then. He is completely worth it!\n\nPLEASE READ: Adopters will not be considered without completing an application. Please visit www.AmericanBulldogRescue.org to apply!

Because of the patience, kindness, and introductions to great friends-- each day I have come forward to meet people more and more!\n\n\n\nEach morning, I excitedly greet the staff, and every potential adopter who walks throughout the day makes me ecstatic and I have to definitely say hello! I walk very well on a leash, especially when I know it is because I am headed to Rescue Recess playgroups with my friends, humans and doggo's alike! One of my playgroup handlers says \"I am a super sweet, cuddly, gentle lady looking for some love\" and if you came to meet me, you would see how true that is! I LOVE treats, they are the way to my heart and \"[She] would be the perfect friend to cuddle up with.\"\n\n\n\nYou should come meet me and experience my wonderful personality for yourself. You would not want to leave the feeling of love and happiness that I give you behind!\n\n---\n\nMacei is a 2 year old female Black Mouth Curr/Feist Mix. She weighs about 29 lbs and is HEARTWORM POSITIVE. Her adoption fee is $0.To learn more about how our variable adoption fees are saving more lives than ever before, please visit: http://bit.do/SPAS_Adopt\n\n---\n\n*Regular adoption policies and procedures apply",

            "description": "Rocky is a bright, bubbly, brindle boy that is about 3 years old and is so ready to leap into your arms and be your best friend forever!  Rocky was turned in by his family along with another dog because they were moving and couldn't take them along.  Although Rocky is ok with the other dog, he is very dominant with dogs and it would be best if he were an only pet.  He sure loves people though!  Rocky is your buddy the minute you meet him.  He's all smiles and butt wiggles, and he sits right down expectantly, hoping for a treat, a toy, or all of your attention.  He's full of energy and goes from sitting to leaping in the air in a second.  He needs a home with no small kids, simply because he'll inadvertently knock them over.  He would love a home with a fenced yard that he could get his jumpies out in.  He'll keep you active and keep you laughing too if you give him a chance!  File#29930  12/30/20  Call 609-693-1900 or email:  office@ahsppz.org to meet Rocky.\n<p>\nIf interested please visit our Forked River Shelter. We are open Mon. - Fri. from \n12:00 P. M. - 6:00 P. M.; and Sat. & Sun. 12:00 P. M. - 5:00 P. M. for directions call 609-693-1900. There is an adoption donation required. The society cannot accept personal checks but we do accept Visa, MC, AE, Discover and cash. As part of our adoption process, we must have proof of residency. Homeowners must show proof of ownership; landlord approval is required for renters before an adoption can be approved.And as always we thank you for your kindness in opening your heart & home to a Society orphan.",

My name is Cheyenne and I am anywhere from 1-2 years old but no one really knows for sure my exact age! When I first came to my foster family, I was a VERY skinny, shy pup and wasn't really sure how to act like a dog. After a few weeks, I have come out of my shell a little and showing everyone what a SWEET girl I really am! I get along well with my two foster fur siblings and they are teaching me how to be a dog. I have met cats at the shelter in Alabama and ignored them all but if I lived with one,  I really don\u2019t know if I would want to hang with it or chase it?!? But, I am very calm and good with kids! I feel safe in my crate, but don't like to go in there with the gate closed and will sometimes cry at night. I REALLY love to snuggle and my favorite part of the day is meal time! I sometimes have had some accidents in the house because I don't like going outside in the cold, but I'm working on it!  I am looking for a home with other calm canine buddies, kids, and grown-up people that will understand that the beginning of my life was pretty hard and I will need time to build up my confidence and trust in the outside world.  But I promise to give you lots of love and companionship and all the snuggles you want!  If you would like to meet me, please fill out a pre-adoption application and a CDR volunteer will get back to you just as quick as they can!\nTail wags and snuggles-Cheyenne\n\n**The ADOPTION FEE for this pet is $400-450.00,  which includes getting the puppy/dog up to date on rabies, distemper and bordetella vaccines, fecal test and deworming if necessary, heartworm test, spay or neuter (not including pre-surgical bloodwork) and a microchip. Free access to our weekly training classes is also included for the life of the dog, something no other rescue in the area offers.***",

He was adopted out as a puppy but found himself coming back to rescue after his family struggled to work through some of his quirks. *Did I lose you already?* What are Mac's quirks you say? He seems to be afraid of men, at his previous house the man wasn't always home so working with him to adjust to \"men are okay\" didn't happen and it became to much. Mac is shy and can be afraid at first, but once he knows he is safe he is a true cuddle bug and loves to run and play with the other dog in the house. He has also been extremely gentle and fascinated by the fosters almost 6-month old baby, he likes to keep watch over her.\n\nMac's adoption fee is $250.00 which includes 3 rounds of shots, neuter, microchip and 1 month of heartworm preventative. If you are interested, please complete the\n\nAdoption Application\n\non our website at\n\na4apetpantry.org",

He is crate trained and housebroken though. He just needs the right person to teach him some manners.

This sweet girl is house trained, crate trained, leashed trained and knows commands such as sit, stay, down, okay, no more and heel! She will bark to alert but knows not to dig or chew. She\u2019s still a pup at heart, so she is not entirely trustworthy with free roam yet. Billie is good with other dogs and loves to play with her ropes and stuffies or enjoy a bully stick. Unfortunately, Billie is looking for a new home after an incident with a younger child. Billie was sound asleep when the little kiddo spooked her and she reacted, as most pups would. Due to her history, older children, if any, are advised so they can properly respect her boundaries and needs. Billie is a true sweetheart who loves her people and wants all the snuggles. Could you give her the second chance she deserves?\n\nGiant Breed Experienced Homes Only.\n\nTo see the most up to date adoption status of this dog, please visit www.bigdogshugepaws.com\nThis is just one of hundreds of gentle giants available for adoption at BDHPI!

Looking forward to learning more about him. Please consider adoption or sharing his post. Potty training and crate training unknown. Maze is said to have lived with other dogs so he is thought to be dog friendly. Cats unknown. \ntapsshelter.org\n\nUPDATE: This sweet boy came home with me today and he was a TON of fun! In his kennel, he is scared and unsure of his surroundings and once I got him to my home, he smiled ear-to-ear with joy. It is evident that this boy has lived in a home before and thrives in a home environment. His timid demeanor at the shelter quickly shed away as he pranced through my house with several toys crammed in his mouth. Maze was playful, yet slightly reserved as he learned his new surroundings of my house. He did not have any accidents in my home, and in fact, he clearly knew what \"gotta go potty\" means as he tilted his head in acknowledgment of that phrase. I think sweet Maze will make an awesome companion!",

Please call the front desk to leave a message to be listed on him. He is very popular and no phone calls will be returned on Milky Way until he's released for adoption. \n\nMilky Way is an approximate 8 month old hound mix that was transferred in from a high volume, low resource animal control. Milky Way is erlichia positive so will need to be on 21 days of antibiotics before he is neutered. \n\nMilky Way is a large breed puppy that will need work on obedience, manners, potty and crate training, need lots of chew toys and exercise to help him grow into a healthy and well adjusted adult. \n\nMilky Way will most likely be released in late January for adoption. He has multiple applications. They will not be processed until he is released for adoption.",

That is how I ended up here in the first place. I climbed. Silly me. I am friendly to people and I think I like other dogs. I will be okay with older children but not little ones. By older, I mean teen and up. My adoption fee is $100.00 this includes my spaying, shots, worming and micro chipping. Contact the shelter by this site, email, or calling to start the process  so  you can come see me. The shelter is closed to the public right now  due to Covid -19  and appointments are given for a visit.  I am Heather.",

Some were dumped, abandoned in an empty house, left tied to a tree, picked up by animal control as strays, or simply unwanted by their owners. We ask that only serious and committed adopters apply as these dogs have suffered enough.\nIf you are interested in meeting this pet please apply to adopt at http://www.wagsandwhiskerspetrescue.com/adopt.html if the pet is still available for adoption and you are approved to adopt we will contact you.\nCalling and checking the status of your application will not increase your chances of adoption",

I am kinda shy until I get to know you but I am a pretty good dog and I get along with other dogs and this a a plus if you already have dogs in your home. I am heartworm positive and will get treatment here at the shelter but you can still adopt me now and decide how treatment will be for me. Sometimes when heartworm positive dogs are treated they stay here until  all treatment is finished and sometimes they get to go with their new family and then brought back to shelter on days treatment is given. The shelter will decide this for me and I am okay with that. My adoption fee is $100.00 and this includes my neutering, worming, shots, and micro chipping. I maybe an older fellow but I am a great guy who is needing a loving family to take care of me and I will be their bestest dog.  Oh, almost forgot.... The shelter is closed for a time so just call, email, or use this site to contact the shelter to get an application to be able to see me and adopt me. You will be given a date and time to come to the shelter when approved and then the wheels are put in motion for me to find a new family. Remember I am Lil Bit....",

She will be arriving to us with her siblings Blair and Chuck on January 30th.\n\nJenny is pretty independent and easy going.  She is ready to either play or chill out with people.  She just follows along with whatever everyone else is doing.  She is indifferent to cuddling.  \n\nAdoption fees cover age specific vaccinations, spay/neuter, microchip, heartworm/lyme/ehrlichia test, worming and transport fees. \n\nAdoption fees: \nThrough 6 months of age $450; \n7 months to through 5 years $400; \n6 years and under 9 years $325: bonded pairs are $500; \n9 years and older $250: bonded pairs are $300 \n\nFOR PUPPIES: PLEASE READ!!\nHomes considering Puppies must be prepared for:\nFlexible Schedules for Potty Training. Puppies can only hold urine for one hour per month of age. Crate Training for the next 10 months to keep them safe from chewing on everything in your home. Supervision with Children and Obedience training. \nSocialization; both with new people, children and other dogs outside of the home.\nHomes that want a well behaved dog, must be prepared to put the time, effort and costs associated to train a puppy. Well behaved dogs are not born, they are trained!  Please do not apply for a puppy if you cannot or do not have the time for a puppy.\n\nAlmost Home Rescue of New England is a 501 c 3 non-profit rescue; rescuing dogs since 2005. All Adoption applications are completed on line at www.almosthomerescue.net \n\nThis dog is available unless it is marked as Pending, meaning Pending Adoption. This dog is in foster care locally, ONLY if Maine or New Hampshire is listed next to the dogs name; otherwise, the dog is still waiting with our partner rescue for an adoption or foster home in New England. \n\nPLEASE NOTE - We will check your veterinary reference, to ensure that current and prior dogs have a history of being kept up to date on rabies and distemper, have had annual heartworm tests, and are on heartworm preventative at least 6 months of the year. Current pets must by spayed/neutered. \n\nImported dogs are transported on a USDA approved transport with a Health Certificate. All imported dogs are quarantined 14 days prior to getting on transport.\n\n",

I love going on walks, and swimming, but my favorite activity is being a lapdog and hanging out with my people. I do not do well with small animals probably because of my sporting ancestors, but I love children of any age and have lived with kids ages 7-19 with my brother Wolf! I\u2019m not quite housetrained yet, because I love being outdoors!\n\nI am smart and I pick up things quickly; I even know how to sit when asked! I am also food driven; I love milk bones and pretty much anything else! I don\u2019t dig and I always stay in my yard. My favorite kind of toys are stuffed animals and sticks! I am a content dog, happy to play and relax whenever. I am very low maintenance, super excited to hang out with people and I am well behaved! If you are looking for a wonderful, fun-loving and easygoing canine companion, I am the one for you!\n\nIf you feel your home might be the right place for such a great dog - the place to start is with the adoption application found at www.dfwrescueme.org/adopt. Once submitted, the foster will contact you promptly to tell you more and to arrange a time to meet!\n\nThe adoption fee for all of our dogs is $250.00, which includes their vaccinations and spay/neuter.\n\nGarrett is participating in the DFW Rescue Me Guest Dog Program, so ongoing care and custody are provided by their foster, not by DFWRM.",

            "description": "Introducing this radiantly wonderful German Shepherd  angel named Elena! She was found in a physical state of actual skin and bones- in advanced starvation, in a busy intersection navigating city streets trying to survive. Thankfully, after what was surely a long time on the streets, a wonderful person welcomed her into their car to try to save her life. They could tell she was in poor shape and brought her to the vets. Fortunately their vets office immediately fell in love with her and wanted to ensure this girl got great care, and wanted to help navigate her towards a better life! \nShe had her medical work completed and went to a super nurturing, doting foster home who was happy to welcome this girl into their home and feed her lots of delicious food and bring this girl back to life!\nShe is definitely a senior, but boy is she absolutely amazing! She is smart as a whip and her foster parents said she can learn just about anything in practically seconds! She knows sir, stay, paw, and has beautiful house manners. She is so eager to please and so sharp. She is confident, strong, silly, a little sassy, and 500% lovable. Anyone with a soft spot for shepherds will be head over heels in love with this girl! She will have conversations with you and is so super loyal and eager to connect! She has a moderate energy level and loves to play! She prefers the companionship of male dogs, though has been good with the ladies also! As a shepherd, she just has a stronger personality with pups- but she loves them. She would love a brother her size but also loves to play with smaller pups too! Her two favorite things to do are to be outside exploring and hiking and taking in nature, or being on the sofa snuggled up with her favorite people resting her head right on their lap!! She is so loyal and affectionate- she really is an amazing old soul. She has gained weight beautifully, and is super great motivated! She is so devoted, she wants to go anywhere she can with you, including lots of car rides and anything fun where she can be by your side! She has done great on and off leash and while she is a senior, she truly is a sharp girl who has so much spunk and wit! She doesn\u2019t show her age a bit. She is in search of a loyal human who will be as devoted to her as she is to them- who will cherish and spoil her through her golden years! \nIf you would love to make her dreams come true, and give her the love she has waited most of her lifetime for, please visit our website and submit an application for adoption today! www.greatdivideanimalrescue.org\n",

My name is Winnebago (Winnie for short), and I am a playful, affectionate little lady who would love an active family to enjoy strolls and hikes with for the rest of my life. I have a medium energy level: I love to be your exercise buddy on long walkies but am also a great work-from-home companion and happily lay next to you while you take care of human business. I am one of the friendliest furballs you will ever meet: I get along with people of all ages (even kiddos) and looove saying hi to everyone we pass while strutting around the neighborhood. I get along with other dogs but my excitement to make new pals can be overwhelming to some pups, so a slow introduction is recommended.\n\nI'm a smartypants, too: I am potty trained and love my crate when the door to it is open. I much prefer to be around my people and can be vocal when crated while you are gone so I would do best in a single-family home without shared walls (no apartments/townhouses/condos for me, please!) I would also love a yard with a tall fence (5-foot minimum) at my forever home so I can run some zoomies to my heart's content. I know a bunch of commands already including sit, come, lay/down, up, and even know my name already. I would thrive with continued training so I can work on my leash skills and focus when outside since I am such a social butterfly and pull to greet potential new friends. I think training will be the first of so many fun adventures we have together! Just imagine it: long, beautiful hikes followed by cozy cuddles on our comfy couch. If that sounds like the dream life to you, please fill out an adoption application so we can live the dream together!\n\nLove,\nWinnebago\n\nADOPTION REQUIREMENTS, NO EXCEPTIONS:\n*ADOPTION FEE: $300\n*Be at least 21 years of age\n*Live in a 50-mile radius of Itasca, within the Illinois border\n*Have the knowledge and agreement of all adults living in the household\n*Have approval from owner of residence (written in lease)\n*Have a valid ID with current address (please provide proof of address if ID address is not up-to-date)\n*Be approved as a suitable adoptive home by Fetching Tails Foundation\n*Be prepared to make a lifetime commitment\n\nIf interested please fill out an application on our website at www.fetchingtailsfoundation.org; please make sure you fill in every required field/question or your submission will not go through. Please note that we take time to learn as much as we can about each dog in our care and our bios are our current observations; we are unable to make any guarantees on the future health or temperament of your adopted dog. Most dogs in our care come with unknown pre-rescue history and as such breed and age estimates are an educated guess.",

I am about three years old, well  about four after Jan. 28th. I am very handsome. I am picky in who I like and I am a fear biter. I do not need to be around children at all because of my biting habit. I would make a good farm dog where I could do my own thing and nobody would have to touch me. The manager here thinks I would be better with men. I do know I am so tired of this cage. I do get to go outside in one of the fenced in areas and I love that. One day I actually got to walk around the building my cage is in and  I was a different dog. I was nice. I will just have to be honest with you, I do not like things done to me like shots and I have to be muzzled for that. I just want to be and to be left alone. You can talk to me but I will be barking at you at the same time. I sure hope there is someone out in this big world that wants a Bear in the family. Contact the shelter by email. this site, or calling and ask for an application to see me. Just maybe I am  the dog you have been looking for and need for your farm. I am Bear and yes, I am a hard to place dog but there is someone for everyone in this world, just have to keep looking and looking and hoping.",

He is still learning how to walk on a leash, as it's really new to him.\n\nPhil does not like energetic dogs. He likes mellow, go with the flow kind of dogs that are more his age and who will respect boundaries. He is not a good fit with cats. Due to his age, he would not be a good fit for small children, as older dogs can be cranky if children don't respect boundaries.",

Other than that, he is the sweetest, most chill guy ever. (and as a bonus, he can sleep thru anything!)  He gets noisy when he needs to go out or wants attention, but is an absolute mellow sweetheart the other 98% of the time.\n\nThis pup was born on 11/3/2020,  so he's 2 months old.   There is a $50 spay/neuter deposit that will be refunded upon proof of procedure.  All adoption fees are used for future rescue efforts.

Plus, we are world travelers \u2013 I was once a street dog from Azerbaijan which you\u2019d never be able to guess with how well behaved I am! My foster mom says I am the \u201calerter\u201d, while my sister is the \u201chunter\u201d when we see squirrels! We absolutely love one another and can often be found snuggling, wrestling, or sneaking a kiss or two.\n\n\nHeartbreakingly, we found out I have Stage 3 Kidney Disease and a kidney stone that is being treated with a special diet and quarterly blood tests that will need to be kept up for the rest of my life. We are searching for a super loving home that will provide the dedicated care needed while I am here and for my sister, when I am no longer around. Luckily, I am not showing many negative symptoms yet, so we still have plenty of wrestling to do and will not be separated! \n\nLikes: Staring lovingly into your eyes, barking at squirrels, running around and playing with my sister makes us feel so free!\n\nDislikes: I can be a little shy and reserved when I first meet you. I am not a fan of quick movements around my head, but I usually am the first of us to warm up to people!\n\nLooking for: A compassionate home dedicated to keeping a close eye on me, my Stage 3 Kidney Disease, my strict diet, and my sister! \n\nWeight: 22 lbs \n\nMy estimated birth date is: 3/5/2016\n\nI'm in a foster home so if you want to meet me please fill out an adoption application at www.animalaidpdx.org.\n\n\nPlease note: due to our screening preference to view the potential home and interview the prospective guardian, we rarely adopt out of our local Portland metro area.",

My sister, Nutmeg, and I are frequently described as the most \u201cbeautiful and perfect pair\u201d! Plus, we are world travelers \u2013 I was originally rescued from a dog meat farm in South Korea. My sister may be shorter than me and born in another country, but I love to chase when she alerts me of a squirrel! We absolutely love one another and can often be found snuggling, wrestling, or sneaking a kiss or two.\n\nHeartbreakingly, we found out my sister Nutmeg has Stage 3 Kidney Disease, so we need a home that can provide the dedicated care needed while Nutmeg is still here with me!\n\nLuckily, she isn\u2019t showing many negative symptoms yet, so we still have plenty of wrestling to do and will not be separated! \n\nLikes: Cuddling up with you at night, yummy treats, and greeting you with my favorite toys while standing on my hind legs when you get home! I also love to run and play with my sister! \n\nDislikes: I can be a little shy and reserved when I first meet you. I am not a fan of quick movements around my head, but I gain confidence very quickly\u2026 especially when treats are involved!\n\nLooking for: A compassionate home dedicated to a bonded pair, and who will spoil me with treats, toys, and a lifetime of adventures! \n\nWeight: 26.4 lbs \n\nMy estimated birth date is: 8/20/2017\n\nI'm in a foster home so if you want to meet me please fill out an adoption application at www.animalaidpdx.org.\n\n<p><strong>Please note: due to our screening preference to view the potential home and interview the prospective guardian, we rarely adopt out of our local Portland metro area.</strong></p>",

I do not know what a complaint is but I was one. I would probably make a good guard dog for you. I am iffy with other male dogs and children. I might be good with female dogs but I really have not decided for sure about this. I am really, really handsome. I like to run around in  my dog run and bark really loud. My adoption fee is $100.00 and this includes my neutering, shots, worming and micro chipping. Because the shelter is closed to the public because of this awful stuff you can only see me when approved. You can get approved by first contacting the shelter by this site, email, or calling and asking for an application to come see me. After filling out the papers and returning to them to the shelter if approved you will be given a day and time to see me. When you come DO NOT forget your mask. You can visit with me and hopefully fall in love with me and want me for your family. I sure hope I will fit into a family and my new human and I will have a great life I just know.

He's been very affectionate with people, he's learning his manners and would benefit with continued basic obedience. Since he is very exuberant we're recommending that he go to a home with children 15 and older. Ragnar has been a bit nervous with other dogs, so long introductions or perhaps even an only dog home would be the best fit for him. He's such a sweet boy just waiting to find a new home to share his love with.",

I especially love to play ball. Life is fun and I want to experience all of it! When I'm not busy playing, I can be found lounging in bed waiting to get my belly scratched. Shelter staff and volunteers are working with me on basic commands, but I need an adopter who will provide me with structure and ongoing training. I respond well to treats, and am eager to learn and please my people. To meet me, please make an appointment with our adoption staff by calling, 916-875-2287. The appointment phone lines are open Tuesday-Sunday from 9:30am to 3:30pm. The phones get busy, so if you don't get through right away, keep trying. We're working hard to provide each potential adopter excellent customer service!",

And Aspen is a typical Malamute / Husky. To adopt this beautiful creature the adopters must commit to training for this girl!! Which will be totally worth it because she responds to praise and loves learning.  She should be a great friend for the next 10-15 years. Aspen also has an up coming spay surgery which is covered by her adoption fee as long as you take her to our vet in Simi Valley! Here\u2019s to seeing Aspen live her best life ever with you guys!!",

I'm a bit shy but very sweet and loving. Also, check out my best buddy, MORGANA! Unfortunately, I've been diagnosed with heartworm disease. If you'd like to donate to help with my treatments, you can call the SPCA at 803-773-9292. You can also donate directly to our website at www.sumterscspca.com or come in person to our shelter at 1140 S. Guignard Dr., Sumter, SC 29150. Woofs and Kisses... SHY! PLEASE call 803-773-9292 after 11:00 AM if you are interested in this pet. If you receive a busy signal, try again. Our call volume has been heavy.

            "description": "In our time with the very handsome 18 month old Ben, we have learned lots of things about him.\n18 m Ben is so very ready for a forever family. He is good with most humans he meets and with a proper intro, good with dogs his size. Due to his prey drive, little kids, cars and small dogs are a no. He\u2019s housebroken and knows a few commands but needs training and someone who\u2019s had experience with working dogs.\nHe enjoys a bit of counter surfing for snacks if given the chance but corrects quickly with a stern OFF.  He is high energy, the kind of high energy you think 45 minutes straight of fetch will burn off and then he\u2019s staring at you and crying to keep going.  He whimpers and vocalizes during play.  Its adorable.  He gets over stimulated and over exuberant and needs to be taken in hand sometimes so a confident owner would benefit him.  We make him sit before we throw his balls so he doesn\u2019t lunge and grab for instance.  We also make him sit for his meals, which he has no problem with any humans being around.\nHe\u2019s a lover.  A jump up in your face, hug you, and beg you to pet him and throw his ball, l.o.v.e.r.  He can be mouthy when he\u2019s amped up, like most of his breed, but a loud \u201cOW\u201d stops him in his tracks.  With guidance he\u2019s truly a phenomenal dog.  He can be picky about new furry friends but for the most part, if introduced properly, he could easily live a happy life with another dog his size.  We wouldn\u2019t recommend small animals as he has displayed some prey drive and a willingness to act on it with bunnies in our yard and small dogs he\u2019s met.\nHe is potty trained and will hold it all night or during a work day easily if he doesn\u2019t have access to outside.   He can be a handful but no more than most dogs at 18 months of his breed.   He has a tendency to grab first, ask questions later when it comes to his toys if not kept control of and guided to make the right decisions.  He\u2019s great in a car and loves to go places.  His preference is to ride shotgun in his own way, standing with his head between the seats to see the world around him.\nThink you\u2019re Bens dream family?  You can apply to foster or adopt at www.Vegasshepherdrescue.com.  Already approved?  Reach out to us for a meeting.\n?",

            "description": "Twizzler was left at vet clinic and his family did not return to pick him up. After several weeks the clinic manager, a Southern Skies Adopter, called and asked if we could help a very sweet young lab. Twizzler is a handsome 1 year old, all black with a small white mark on his chest. He weighs 54 pounds but should probably weigh 70 pounds. He was very thin when he arrived at the clinic he was left at, he started gaining weight there and is continuing to eat well. He is currently on puppy food for the extra calories and extra vitamins and nutrients. Twizzler is potty trained. He complains a little at first when he is crated but then calms down. If he barks in the crate it usually means he needs to go to the bathroom. Twizzler is cautious when meeting new people but warms up quickly to them. He is discovering lots of new things, like steps, various outdoor noises and is handling each new thing better as the days go on. He would love another dog to play and has not been tested around cats. He also is so good with young children, no jumping, very gentle. He is young and likes toys but will occasionally grab a shoe or other off limited item, so he needs to be monitored when out of the crate. He does not know any commands but stands still to have his leash put on and is beginning to understand kennel up. I believe he would love the one-on-one experience of training and excel at it. Twizzler is not a jumper, enjoys TV, loves being outside, easy on a leash, very gentle and inquisitive. He will make great hiking walking buddy. He is discovering snuggling; belly rubs and ear scratching are among his favorite things. He likes treats but I do not believe he has ever been handed one so taking one is new, but he is very gentle, no mouthing. He knows when he gets in trouble and does not like it, he is a pleaser and a tail wager! Twizzler would love a fenced in yard. Twizzler is up to date on vaccinations, microchipped but sadly he did test positive for heartworms making him the 31st dog this year SSLR has taken in. His treatment has begun, and Southern Skies will provide the needed treatment that can then go with him. Twizzler also had a common eyelid condition called entropion and he had surgery to correct it. The whole world is just opening up to this sweet, calm, loving boy, would you like to show him how great the world can really be? Please apply and complete our online pre-adoption application if you are interested in Twizzler becoming a part of your family. http://www.southernskiesrescue.org/adoption-application",

I am friendly to people but do not need to be in a home with children. I would do better at a farm. I was running around an RV park in the area and picked up by animal control. Did I tell you I am a large boy? Yes, I think I have already. I am scary looking to some people but you will just have to get to know me. My adoption fee is $100.00 and this includes my neutering shots, worming and micro chipping. Because of Covid you can not just come see me. You will first have to contact the shelter by email, this site, calling and then request an application to see me and if approved you will be given a time and day to come to the shelter. I am here waiting for my new home and I hope you will consider me if you like big dogs and want to give me a wonderful loving home. I am Pepper",

Bishop is 8 months old, weighs 35#, is neutered, fully vaccinated, microchipped, HW negative and on preventative.  He's learning that humans are really nice and playing with other dogs is fun!  He hasn't met a cat yet.\n\nWe adopt in the Dallas/Ft. Worth and East Texas areas.  A fenced yard is required and a vet reference is appreciated.",

Please don\u2019t leave your shoes around because I love those too. I don\u2019t mind sleeping in a crate with my dog bed and blanket but my favorite time is to cuddle on the sofa with my human. I am not fully house trained, but I am trying really hard to do good, please have patience with me. I am good on the leash but do get nervous and don\u2019t want to move at times. So you might have to nudge me a little. I love to be around other dogs and wouldn\u2019t mind having a dog sibling. As another dog helps me to be more confident, then I am much more comfortable. I am good with children, but I might accidentally knock over a toddler as I love to play. I am such a snuggle bug, and truly love those I am around.\"\n\nLilly is about 10 months old and weighs 34 pounds. She is gorgeous and will make a wonderful new BFF ! She is healthy, up to date on her shots and is spayed. Lilly is currently in New England and can travel to her new home ASAP. Lilly would love to be with an active person and could live as the only dog or if you are trying to add another dog to your family. She is flexible!\nHer adoption donation is $400 .\n\n*Unless stated otherwise, all dogs will be spayed or neutered, on flea/tick product and heart worm prevention medicine (if older than 5 months) and micro chipped prior to adoption.\n\n*Please note that while we do our best to accurately state the breed or breed mix of a dog, we often have very limited information to draw from. Identifying the breed without pedigrees and information on heritage can be very challenging!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our animals, please go to www.angelsamongusanimalrescue.org and fill out an online adoption application. Thank you!\n\nMassachusett's Residents: Effective September 28, 2017 a Quarantine Fee of $120 will be required  (in addition to the adoption fee) to adopt a dog that has been Quarantined. Massachusetts mandates that all dogs entering MA shall be quarantined for 48 hours in a state approved facility.",

He would do best in an active home with at least one fur sibling for him to play with and run around in the backyard. A fenced yard is recommended as well. He is full of cuddles and as much as he likes to run and play, he loves to nap and especially looks forward to sleeping with his person at night. He does well with kids, but can get overly excited at times, and could possibly knock the little ones over. He LOVES to go on walks and is very curious about his surroundings, especially when he sees squirrels, rabbits, etc. He has lived with cats, but again, can be overly excited when trying to play with them.",

He was with the same owner nearly all of his life over the past 8 years.   He\u2019s been having problems coping with that loss.   He is undergoing treatment for his condition so we can get him as healthy as possible for adoption.\nMicah was able to go to a foster home.  At first he was stressed and anxious and confused, but he came around and showed all the love he has to give.  He is friendly to small humans so far and seems less reactive to calm small dogs.  He does not seem to be a fan of dogs his size.   He\u2019s a dream of a dog for the right family.   He walks well on a leash once he bonds to you but can be reactive to barking big dogs.\nHe will require a lifetime of management of his condition but he\u2019s fantastic about allowing handling and easy to care for.  Once his condition is under control, it will be relatively simple to manage.",

Please read carefully for details on our adoption process:\n\u2022First, please note that we are unable to receive correspondence through Petfinder\u2019s system.  Any messages sent through Petfinder or any buttons on this listing will unfortunately not reach us. If you\u2019re interested in adopting please visit www.sanctuaryrescue.com and submit an adoption questionnaire under the forms section.\n\u2022 Applications are open until we will change the adoption listing to \u201cApplications Closed\u201d. Next, foster parents will contact approved applicants to set up a meet and greet. This can take up to 1 to 2 weeks.\n\u2022 Once a dog is officially adopted we will remove its listing from Petfinder. So if this listing is gone, this dog has found its forever family and is no longer available.\n\u2022 Since Covid lockdown orders, we have seen a massive increase in people interested in adopting dogs (yay!). This means each dog, especially puppies, receive multiple applications in the couple of days we have applications open. There is usually several applicants for one pup. If it doesn\u2019t work out this time, please understand this is not a personal judgement but likely a result of supply and demand. We encourage you to reapply in the future.\n\nMeet Smits! Smits is approximately two years old and weight under 10 lbs. Breed heritage is pure guess. He is working on crate training and basic commands. He likes other dogs but needs to work on boundaries and how to engage in play. He has met one cat during is time in rescue, he was interested but the cat was not. \n\nSmits would love a person or small family who wants a constant companion and a lap dog. Someone who is looking for a goofy friend to entertain them. Smits would like someone who enjoys daily walks that do not need to be strenuous. Smits is super sweet, funny, goofy little guy that is active but not hyper. He is a velcro dog who  loves to be on his person's lap a lot! \n\nJimmy Smits' adoption fee is $250, which includes age-appropriate vaccinations, current on preventatives, neuter, and microchip. If you would like to make this handsome boy a part of your family, please visit sanctuaryrescue.com and complete an adoption questionnaire under the \u201cForms\u201d tab.",

Her tail wags with the fun when greeting her person and going out for a walk. Her leash manners are lovely, her tail wags as we walk, and she gives off such a pleasant 'vibe', if she catches a scent, you can give her a light tug . She loves to be petted and snuggled by her person, leaning in for better cuddles and all the while wagging her tail, That made her happy!! Chasing a tennis ball is just as much fun and she bounds after it bouncing it around. you can take it right out of her mouth for another throw and her tail wags more as she leaps after it. Shes an absolute doll!!! She was/is a very good mama but she is sooooo ready to be a puppy herself and be loved and shown direction/guidance/training so she can become her best self. Some good exercise, followed by some good snuggles....what could be better than that? Well, since you asked, it could be better if she were in her own home, surrounded by people who love her. She's an easy girl to love, so meet her and find out for yourself. With Mama by your side you'll have it all! She is potty and crate trained.\n\n \n\nAll dogs will be altered, microchipped, and receive age-appropriate vaccines prior to adoption.

            "description": "Sadie is a highly intelligent and energetic young Lab / Antolian Shepherd mix who is looking for an active family. Sadie is only one year old, but she is already fully housetrained, crate trained and knows many commands like bye bye, bed, look for/find it, and bring it! Not only does Sadie love to use her mind, but she also likes to stay physically active and would make an excellent agility, field or diving dog. Sadie doesn't realize her size and strengh; so while that means she thinks she fits perfectly cuddled up in a lap after a long day of adventures, it also means she would do best in a home with no small children. Sadie also has a high prey drive, so she needs to be in a home with no cats or small dogs.\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Sadie is $400. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

            "description": "~~~~~\nWe are SO SORRY TO ADVISE YOU ... We are NO LONGER ADOPTING TO MASSACHUSETTS RESIDENTS DUE TO STRICTER AND UNATTAINABLE REGULATIONS !!\n\nArriving 2.20.2012  \nSkipper is a 5 month old Dachshund (Beagle??)  mix that weighs 12 pounds. HE was found loitering around the town dumpsters and our volunteer , Daphanie scooped him up and took him home. \nAfter a warm meal, a warm bath and a soft bed, he looked a LOT better. \nWe have since had all of his vetting tended to and he will be here 1/23/2021. He is energetic and \"BUBBLY\" Perhaps we SHOULD have called him Champagne - or per haps Prosecco! \n He is only 5-6 months of age  and an absolute love-bug... Thanks to Mister Robinson for modeling!  \nWe think that he will only get 18-20 pounds as a full adult size! \n\n~~~~~\n\nDue to Covid-19 concerns, we are not planning any public adoption events. If you are pre approved , we will call to set up an appointment to come and meet the dog and potentially take them home. It is by appointment only- \nDogs will be brought into the outdoor kennel for you to meet and make your decision. MASKS WILL BE MANDATORY to maintain EVERYONE'S safety  NO EXCEPTIONS PLEASE !! Unless otherwise noted, the puppies and dogs listed will arrive on Saturday, January 23rd 2021 .\nPlease follow this link to fill out an application. It is step one in adopting a pup from our rescue.\nhttp://littlerhodyrescue.com/adoption-application/ \n \n\n*Filling an application does not guarantee you as the adopter. All applicant's references will be called. PLEASE call your veterinarian and personal references and allow consent to speaking with us ! \nWe cannot process your application otherwise. Failure will put your application in 'Limbo\"  \nWe process applications as they arrive. The first approved applicant will be called and the pup taken off of Petfinder. We do not have the man/ woman power to all all other applicants to advise them. \nIF there s another dog that you are interested in as well, please list at the top of the application and we will enter your application for that pup if the first choice has been adopted. \n\nTHANK YOU !!! You are giving a first rate dog a second chance....By adopting! \n\n***** SADLY , we need to put this in print: THIS IS A RESCUE DOG. We do NOT know their birthday / age.  (unless other wise noted)  \nMore often than not, OUR TEAM  has saved them from euthanasia in Southern shelters. \nWe do not know any more than our Veterinarians offer to us. \n We often have them in kennels, and utilize crate training.  House training status is often NOT KNOWN. \nPrior Health, estimated weight  (as an adult), breed (Including the parents' breed , size or mix)   and some health concerns are  NOT KNOWN unless our veterinarians discover it and offer the information to us.   Again, these are strays and turn ins from all over the country. They do NOT come with labels; nor guarantees. \n\nCharacteristics and disposition can and will evolve with time.\nYOU the adopter are responsible to train and keep up to date on vaccines and preventatives.  \nYOU the adopter are responsible for taking care of this new member of your family. \n *************\n\n****\nOur adoption fees are $ 600. This fee includes the transportation of the pet from one of the organizations that we work with in TX, LA or TN. Before joining us in RI all dogs are: spayed/neutered, microchipped, up to date on age-appropriate vaccines, and on de-wormers, flea/tick and heartworm prevention. In addition, all adults (6 months +) are heartworm tested and MUST be negative for both heartworm and microfilaria before transport. \n\nIn addition to the above, all dogs must have a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection and be deemed healthy per USDA law in order to travel. Once they have been certified they are then transported via USDA transport services only, which is required by law. \n We  sometimes don't understand how bad the situation is for these pups and dogs in southern states.  Many people in the south don't spay or neuter their pets as we do here. Subsequently, there are thousands of beautiful , worthy pups and dogs, kittens and cats  that are dumped, shot, abandoned, brought into shelters, neglected, abused and abandoned.  We step in , tend to their veterinary needs. As you can see above, we never fail to properly spay and neuter. Everything is done with the  caring , capable hands of our veterinarians to get them healthy and ready to place them for adoption. That's when we put the demand for family- friendly pets with the supply ..... \n\nGive a first rate dog a second chance!!!! ADOPT! \n\n\nKeep in mind that we also offer a two week return policy for the return of a healthy dog that includes a full refund. We want to make sure that the adoption is a perfect fit for both you and the dog.\n\nIf you would like more information about adopting please select \"More About Little Rhody Rescue\" where you will also find our online application if you'd like to proceed with the adoption process.

            "description": "~~~~~\nWe are SO SORRY TO ADVISE YOU ... We are NO LONGER ADOPTING TO MASSACHUSETTS RESIDENTS DUE TO STRICTER AND UNATTAINABLE REGULATIONS !!\n\nComing 1/23/2021\n\nSpike is a 1-2 year old Saint Bernard mix!\n He is roughly 70 pounds and will not gain that much more - perhaps another 5-10 so that he is in full weight! \n He is sweet on everyone but thinks that the cat is a play- thing... so perhaps NO CAT for you! \nHe gets along beautifully with kids- especially that he is STILL a pup and he is 70+ pounds! \nHe is now fully vetted. We admitted him into the shelter when no one came for him... he was initially taken in as a stray and when no one came, we offered to take him in! \n\n\n\n~~~~~\n\nDue to Covid-19 concerns, we are not planning any public adoption events. If you are pre approved , we will call to set up an appointment to come and meet the dog and potentially take them home. It is by appointment only- \nDogs will be brought into the outdoor kennel for you to meet and make your decision. MASKS WILL BE MANDATORY to maintain EVERYONE'S safety  NO EXCEPTIONS PLEASE !! Unless otherwise noted, the puppies and dogs listed will arrive on Saturday, January 23rd 2021 .\nPlease follow this link to fill out an application. It is step one in adopting a pup from our rescue.\nhttp://littlerhodyrescue.com/adoption-application/ \n \n\n*Filling an application does not guarantee you as the adopter. All applicant's references will be called. PLEASE call your veterinarian and personal references and allow consent to speaking with us ! \nWe cannot process your application otherwise. Failure will put your application in 'Limbo\"  \nWe process applications as they arrive. The first approved applicant will be called and the pup taken off of Petfinder. We do not have the man/ woman power to all all other applicants to advise them. \nIF there s another dog that you are interested in as well, please list at the top of the application and we will enter your application for that pup if the first choice has been adopted. \n\nTHANK YOU !!! You are giving a first rate dog a second chance....By adopting! \n\n***** SADLY , we need to put this in print: THIS IS A RESCUE DOG. We do NOT know their birthday / age.  (unless other wise noted)  \nMore often than not, OUR TEAM  has saved them from euthanasia in Southern shelters. \nWe do not know any more than our Veterinarians offer to us. \n We often have them in kennels, and utilize crate training.  House training status is often NOT KNOWN. \nPrior Health, estimated weight  (as an adult), breed (Including the parents' breed , size or mix)   and some health concerns are  NOT KNOWN unless our veterinarians discover it and offer the information to us.   Again, these are strays and turn ins from all over the country. They do NOT come with labels; nor guarantees. \n\nCharacteristics and disposition can and will evolve with time.\nYOU the adopter are responsible to train and keep up to date on vaccines and preventatives.  \nYOU the adopter are responsible for taking care of this new member of your family. \n *************\n\n****\nOur adoption fees are $ 600. This fee includes the transportation of the pet from one of the organizations that we work with in TX, LA or TN. Before joining us in RI all dogs are: spayed/neutered, microchipped, up to date on age-appropriate vaccines, and on de-wormers, flea/tick and heartworm prevention. In addition, all adults (6 months +) are heartworm tested and MUST be negative for both heartworm and microfilaria before transport. \n\nIn addition to the above, all dogs must have a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection and be deemed healthy per USDA law in order to travel. Once they have been certified they are then transported via USDA transport services only, which is required by law. \n We  sometimes don't understand how bad the situation is for these pups and dogs in southern states.  Many people in the south don't spay or neuter their pets as we do here. Subsequently, there are thousands of beautiful , worthy pups and dogs, kittens and cats  that are dumped, shot, abandoned, brought into shelters, neglected, abused and abandoned.  We step in , tend to their veterinary needs. As you can see above, we never fail to properly spay and neuter. Everything is done with the  caring , capable hands of our veterinarians to get them healthy and ready to place them for adoption. That's when we put the demand for family- friendly pets with the supply ..... \n\nGive a first rate dog a second chance!!!! ADOPT! \n\n\nKeep in mind that we also offer a two week return policy for the return of a healthy dog that includes a full refund. We want to make sure that the adoption is a perfect fit for both you and the dog.\n\nIf you would like more information about adopting please select \"More About Little Rhody Rescue\" where you will also find our online application if you'd like to proceed with the adoption process. Thank you!",

We are NO LONGER ADOPTING TO MASSACHUSETTS RESIDENTS DUE TO STRICTER AND UNATTAINABLE REGULATIONS !!\nCOMING 1/23/2021 \n\n\nAmerican Eskimo X  ????  mix! She\u2019s only about 25 pounds, pictures can be deceiving! \nShe\u2019s about 1  1/2 years old \nShe looks SO much bigger than she is!!!!!  \nShe was taken in from a rural Texas shelter when her time (and Spike's time ) was 'up\" \nshe is so gentle and sweet. After being in her foster home, she is also proving to be a great love bunny! \nShe doesn't really care for cats, but is wonderful with other dogs and kids and older folks too- \nShe is working on her house training skills and will be  a wonderful addition to any home- so long as you win't mind a bit of white fur on the sofa! \n\n\n\n~~~~~\n\nDue to Covid-19 concerns, we are not planning any public adoption events. If you are pre approved , we will call to set up an appointment to come and meet the dog and potentially take them home. It is by appointment only- \nDogs will be brought into the outdoor kennel for you to meet and make your decision. MASKS WILL BE MANDATORY to maintain EVERYONE'S safety  NO EXCEPTIONS PLEASE !! Unless otherwise noted, the puppies and dogs listed will arrive on Saturday, January 23rd 2021 .\nPlease follow this link to fill out an application. It is step one in adopting a pup from our rescue.\nhttp://littlerhodyrescue.com/adoption-application/ \n \n\n*Filling an application does not guarantee you as the adopter. All applicant's references will be called. PLEASE call your veterinarian and personal references and allow consent to speaking with us ! \nWe cannot process your application otherwise. Failure will put your application in 'Limbo\"  \nWe process applications as they arrive. The first approved applicant will be called and the pup taken off of Petfinder. We do not have the man/ woman power to all all other applicants to advise them. \nIF there s another dog that you are interested in as well, please list at the top of the application and we will enter your application for that pup if the first choice has been adopted. \n\nTHANK YOU !!! You are giving a first rate dog a second chance....By adopting! \n\n***** SADLY , we need to put this in print: THIS IS A RESCUE DOG. We do NOT know their birthday / age.  (unless other wise noted)  \nMore often than not, OUR TEAM  has saved them from euthanasia in Southern shelters. \nWe do not know any more than our Veterinarians offer to us. \n We often have them in kennels, and utilize crate training.  House training status is often NOT KNOWN. \nPrior Health, estimated weight  (as an adult), breed (Including the parents' breed , size or mix)   and some health concerns are  NOT KNOWN unless our veterinarians discover it and offer the information to us.   Again, these are strays and turn ins from all over the country. They do NOT come with labels; nor guarantees. \n\nCharacteristics and disposition can and will evolve with time.\nYOU the adopter are responsible to train and keep up to date on vaccines and preventatives.  \nYOU the adopter are responsible for taking care of this new member of your family. \n *************\n\n****\nOur adoption fees are $ 600. This fee includes the transportation of the pet from one of the organizations that we work with in TX, LA or TN. Before joining us in RI all dogs are: spayed/neutered, microchipped, up to date on age-appropriate vaccines, and on de-wormers, flea/tick and heartworm prevention. In addition, all adults (6 months +) are heartworm tested and MUST be negative for both heartworm and microfilaria before transport. \n\nIn addition to the above, all dogs must have a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection and be deemed healthy per USDA law in order to travel. Once they have been certified they are then transported via USDA transport services only, which is required by law. \n We  sometimes don't understand how bad the situation is for these pups and dogs in southern states.  Many people in the south don't spay or neuter their pets as we do here. Subsequently, there are thousands of beautiful , worthy pups and dogs, kittens and cats  that are dumped, shot, abandoned, brought into shelters, neglected, abused and abandoned.  We step in , tend to their veterinary needs. As you can see above, we never fail to properly spay and neuter. Everything is done with the  caring , capable hands of our veterinarians to get them healthy and ready to place them for adoption. That's when we put the demand for family- friendly pets with the supply ..... \n\nGive a first rate dog a second chance!!!! ADOPT! \n\n\nKeep in mind that we also offer a two week return policy for the return of a healthy dog that includes a full refund. We want to make sure that the adoption is a perfect fit for both you and the dog.\n\nIf you would like more information about adopting please select \"More About Little Rhody Rescue\" where you will also find our online application if you'd like to proceed with the adoption process. Thank you!",

Nice to meet ya!  \n\nWATCH MY VIDEO:  https://youtu.be/C6OmmW1qWzY\n\nhttps://youtu.be/7j6NvJyryLo\n\nA nice person came along and took me in and, now, I am ready to hit the road to your house!  Uh, make that \u201cour\u201d house, OK?  I definitely need a house with a fenced-in yard cuz I need room to run and romp and be safe!  The rescue requires (1) a fenced-in yard and (2) a vet reference from a vet that you have used for a current or previous dog to be sure that all vetting was done and (3) a comparable-sized doggie sibling)  \n\nI am a Retriever/Staffy mix.  I am 10 MONTHS old and I weigh 55-60 pounds. I have been neutered and am up to date on vaccines so I'm ready to go to my new home with YOU!!  Those funny-looking 2-legged creatures said I\u2019m also microchipped \u2013 whatever THAT is.  At any rate, I am fully vetted.  Is that anything close to petted?  I love to be petted!  They say I'm precious.  Hmmm, Is my name Milo or Precious?\n\nWanna hear some more good stuff about me?  OK, here goes.  I like ALL people and ALL dogs.  I need to have a DOGGIE SIBLING about my size so we can run and romp together and burn up LOTS and LOTS of energy!   I know basic commands.  I respond very well to consistent, positive reinforcement training and I'm a good learner!  Smart, huh?\n\nI am attentive, affectionate, silly, playful and loyal.  I LOVE cuddles, car rides, holding hands and tummy rubs.  I am a beta doggie.  I back down when prompted by aggressive dogs. I'm an amazing companion!\n\nI have lots to learn.  Will you teach me all the things a pup needs to know to be safe and happy? I LOVE to give kisses so get ready!  \n\nIf you have children, then need to be older children - 12 and up because I like to play hard and run fast!  It's fun!\n\nI like to take naps when I'm tired from playing.  I need  love, exercise and couch-sitting when we get tired!  Let's be a team, OK?\n\nIf you would like to take me home (and you know you do), please email rescuedogsgalore@gmail.com  and they can get me on my way to a new and loving home!  Once you adopt me, I will be flown to Seattle from Houston, TX.  (Seattle is the only place we can fly to right now.)  My adoption fee is $450 and includes my vetting, neutering, flight cost, travel crate, Health Certificate and a microchip.\n\n",

Nice to meet ya!  \n\nWATCH MY VIDEO:  https://youtu.be/C6OmmW1qWzY\n\nhttps://youtu.be/7j6NvJyryLo\n\nA nice person came along and took me in and, now, I am ready to hit the road to your house!  Uh, make that \u201cour\u201d house, OK?  I definitely need a house with a fenced-in yard cuz I need room to run and romp and be safe!  The rescue requires (1) a fenced-in yard and (2) a vet reference from a vet that you have used for a current or previous dog to be sure that all vetting was done and (3) a comparable-sized doggie sibling)  \n\nI am a Retriever/Staffy mix.  I am 10 MONTHS old and I weigh 55-60 pounds. I have been neutered and am up to date on vaccines so I'm ready to go to my new home with YOU!!  Those funny-looking 2-legged creatures said I\u2019m also microchipped \u2013 whatever THAT is.  At any rate, I am fully vetted.  Is that anything close to petted?  I love to be petted!  They say I'm precious.  Hmmm, Is my name Milo or Precious?\n\nWanna hear some more good stuff about me?  OK, here goes.  I like ALL people and ALL dogs.  I need to have a DOGGIE SIBLING about my size so we can run and romp together and burn up LOTS and LOTS of energy!   I know basic commands.  I respond very well to consistent, positive reinforcement training and I'm a good learner!  Smart, huh?\n\nI am attentive, affectionate, silly, playful and loyal.  I LOVE cuddles, car rides, holding hands and tummy rubs.  I am a beta doggie.  I back down when prompted by aggressive dogs. I'm an amazing companion!\n\nI have lots to learn.  Will you teach me all the things a pup needs to know to be safe and happy? I LOVE to give kisses so get ready!  \n\nIf you have children, then need to be older children - 12 and up because I like to play hard and run fast!  It's fun!\n\nI like to take naps when I'm tired from playing.  I need  love, exercise and couch-sitting when we get tired!  Let's be a team, OK?\n\nIf you would like to take me home (and you know you do), please email rescuedogsgalore@gmail.com  and they can get me on my way to a new and loving home!  Once you adopt me, I will be flown to Seattle from Houston, TX.  (Seattle is the only place we can fly to right now.)  My adoption fee is $450 and includes my vetting, neutering, flight cost, travel crate, Health Certificate and a microchip.\n\n",

            "description": "Teddy Bear Bruce is now available for adoption! <3\n\n\"Bruce is an oversized puppy. He is playful, he is curious, he has spurts of energy, and he seems to be looking at the world through new eyes. I don't think he was ever part of a family before coming to us. He has scratches across his nose that we fear may have been from a fight with some wild animal. He also has scabs on his body and head. They have healed nicely, but this boy has been through something. He came to us a rambunctious puppy. He wanted to play with other dogs, he was food crazy, and he had manners to learn. In the almost week he has been with us, he has settled in nicely. \nBruce is starting to try and play with the other dogs. You can tell he never has before. He plays rough, but the other dogs are teaching him how to play. He sometimes gets so excited he turns into a jumping fool and barks around. He has so much life in him, and is learning how to be a dog again. It is really fun to watch him come around. To watch the light return to his eyes. To watch him learn what having a family feels like. He still has some manners to learn, but that is what comes with having a rescue dog. He knew nothing and has come so far in the few days we have had him. \nBruce is potty trained, good with other dogs, and has good house manners. Right now, he just wants to be with his people and will jump up at the door and whine when his people leave. He settles down shortly after, though. He LOVES attention and will lean against you so much you think he will fall over. He loves giving you this big ole grin that will melt your heart. He also has the head tilt down to a T. This dog will steal you heart, let me tell you. If you know big dogs, you will understand this boy is all puppy still. He didn't get to just have fun. He didn't get to have a carefree life, but he sure is getting to now! With some more training, this guy will be the most amazing family member. He just has this aura around him that draws you in, and before you know it...he has stolen your heart.\" \n\nI showed up as a stray to the shelter. It is pretty scary to not have anyone. No one came for me. No one adopted me. No one seemed to want me. And why I don't know why. I wanted a home so bad. Then, something did happen. A rescue stepped up for me. Before I knew it, I was in a foster home and my life flipped. I got to come inside the house, which was a totally new concept. There were other dogs around, and I was so excited to play with them. Now that I have settled in, I am ready to search for my forever family! My name is Bruce and I am a 2 year old male Great Pyrenees/Anatolian mix. I currently weigh about 72lbs, and will top out close to the 85-90lb range. I believe my coat is going to come in thicker as well. \n\nMy Personality: \nI am a mix of calm and playful. If the other dogs are excited, I get super excited. If everyone is calm, I am pretty calm too. I tend to match the energy of my family. I am indifferent when it comes to meeting new people. I would rather explore my surroundings. I have not been to any public outings, but figure I would be excited to check out my surroundings. I don't seem to be interested in playing fetch. I am unsure if I am a water dog or not. I am unsure of what toys are right now, but my fosters think I will start playing with them soon. I was pretty crazy about food when I first came into rescue. I have settled down since, and am fine as long as another dog doesn't try taking my treat/food. I don't seem to have any issues with resource guarding. I don't seem to be much of a jumper/hugger with people. I do load up pretty easy in the car. Once in, I tend to just lay down and chill. I do walk well on a leash, but may pull some. Especially if there is something I want to check out. \n\nI am good with other dogs. I am learning to play with them, and can be a bit rough at times. I run/jump around them trying to get them to play. My fosters dogs are teaching me the proper way to play, but I definitely need a playmate my size. I would be too rambunctious for a smaller dog. I am okay with cats, but will give chase if they run. I have not been around any kids. Since I am rowdy at times, the kiddos should be 12+. \n\nMy House Manners: \nI am a big ole puppy. I am curious about things and like to explore the house. I have not attempted to chew on anything I shouldn't. I am pretty excitable still and don't believe I would be a good candidate for apartment living. I can be vocal when I get excited or hear other dogs barking. When no one is home, I am given free roam of the house. At night, I sleep downstairs. I am potty trained. I am NOT kennel trained, though. I panic in a kennel and need a home that won't kennel me. \n\nTo My New Family: \n\n-I am looking for a home that has at least one other playful dog my size. \n\n-I would love a family that is home most of the day. \n\n-I am looking for a home that won't kennel me. I panic in one. I know some dogs see it as their safe place, but I don't. \n\nIf you are looking for a big ole puppy/teddy bear than I am totally the boy for you. I am a playful and loving guy looking to find his place in this world. https://www.pyrpawsandfluffytailsrescue.com/adoption-app \n\nMy adoption fee is $225. That includes my DHLPP, Rabies, and Bordatella shots. I will be micro-chipped, heart-worm tested, ehrlichia tested, have a fecal done, be de-wormed, be spayed/neutered and will be current on my heart-worm and flea/tick prevention.\n\nLastly, I am being fostered in Kiowa, OK. I have no qualms about going out of state if my adopters don't live in Oklahoma. All I ask is they come pick me up. Those transports are too stressful and this rescue doesn't put us on those or ship us.",

He is a blank slate and does need some basic training. He is full of life inside the home, loves to play and adores his person but is a little skittish and timid when on walks and hears loud noises. He has lots of energy so is looking for a home that is active and has another playful dog. He still has a lot of his young puppy traits and when he gets bored, will find something interesting to chew on.   He is working on crate training so he can understand boundaries.

You can tell he may have had a rough time so far.  He is about 4 years old.  He seems good with other dogs.  At first he's a little timid about a gentle touch, but he's going to get a lot more at ARL!   He so deserves them and hopefully a loving forever home this time.  My adoption fee is $125 which includes my spay/neuter, age appropriate vaccinations,  heartworm disease test,  microchip/registration fee and collar .  ADOPT ME TODAY and find a friend for life!

I ended up being pregnant again (surprise!) and had 6 more adorable babies. They have all found their homes and now its my turn. When I first came into rescue I was really scared and shy. I was also very protective of my babies, so it made it difficult to work on socializing me. But the past few weeks I've really been coming out of my shell. Turns out I LOVE dogs! I love to play chase, and wrestle - I have a fairly rough and rowdy playstyle with another dog that plays the same way - but also tone it down and just throw playbows at the more mellow dogs. I prefer female humans, but am learning that the male ones aren't too bad either (as long as they have lots of treats). I am very food motivated which is helpful. I am trusted loose in the house, and am a really good girl inside, I usually just sit and stare out the window. But then as soon as we go outside, playtime is on! I'm looking for a loving home that will be patient with me as I continue learning and socializing. Another friendly dog my size would be great too! \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/thegooddogrescue/videos/1844508895705399\n\nDue to the current events, the rescue is not able to host adoption events.  Please fill out an application and we will conduct phone interviews and set up outdoor meet and greets! www.thegooddogrescue.org\n\nMy adoption fee is $250 and I will be spayed, microchipped and up to date on vaccinations prior to adoption",

            "description": "~~~~~\nUno is a 3 month old Maltese Chihuahua mix- she her mom (Maltese) and her siblings came into the local shelter in Louisiana ALL of them had Canine Parvo virus.  A deadly horrible virus whose morbidity is extremely high. \nShe is only of the only survivors. Momma never made it , either.  So a bottle feeding we will go! They were lucky - at such a small size and young age; many won't make it. \n\nat any rate, they survived and are here to tell the tale !  Fill out an application if you are interested?? \nLittleRhodyrescue.com\n\n~~~~~\n\nDue to Covid-19 concerns, we are not planning any public adoption events. If you are pre approved , we will call to set up an appointment to come and meet the dog and potentially take them home. It is by appointment only- \nDogs will be brought into the outdoor kennel for you to meet and make your decision. MASKS WILL BE MANDATORY to maintain EVERYONE'S safety  NO EXCEPTIONS PLEASE !! Unless otherwise noted, the puppies and dogs listed will arrive on Saturday, January 23rd 2021 .\nPlease follow this link to fill out an application. It is step one in adopting a pup from our rescue.\nhttp://littlerhodyrescue.com/adoption-application/ \n \n\n*Filling an application does not guarantee you as the adopter. All applicant's references will be called. PLEASE call your veterinarian and personal references and allow consent to speaking with us ! \nWe cannot process your application otherwise. Failure will put your application in 'Limbo\"  \nWe process applications as they arrive. The first approved applicant will be called and the pup taken off of Petfinder. We do not have the man/ woman power to all all other applicants to advise them. \nIF there s another dog that you are interested in as well, please list at the top of the application and we will enter your application for that pup if the first choice has been adopted. \n\nTHANK YOU !!! You are giving a first rate dog a second chance....By adopting! \n\n***** SADLY , we need to put this in print: THIS IS A RESCUE DOG. We do NOT know their birthday / age.  (unless other wise noted)  \nMore often than not, OUR TEAM  has saved them from euthanasia in Southern shelters. \nWe do not know any more than our Veterinarians offer to us. \n We often have them in kennels, and utilize crate training.  House training status is often NOT KNOWN. \nPrior Health, estimated weight  (as an adult), breed (Including the parents' breed , size or mix)   and some health concerns are  NOT KNOWN unless our veterinarians discover it and offer the information to us.   Again, these are strays and turn ins from all over the country. They do NOT come with labels; nor guarantees. \n\nCharacteristics and disposition can and will evolve with time.\nYOU the adopter are responsible to train and keep up to date on vaccines and preventatives.  \nYOU the adopter are responsible for taking care of this new member of your family. \n *************\n\n****\nOur adoption fees are $ 600. This fee includes the transportation of the pet from one of the organizations that we work with in TX, LA or TN. Before joining us in RI all dogs are: spayed/neutered, microchipped, up to date on age-appropriate vaccines, and on de-wormers, flea/tick and heartworm prevention. In addition, all adults (6 months +) are heartworm tested and MUST be negative for both heartworm and microfilaria before transport. \n\nIn addition to the above, all dogs must have a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection and be deemed healthy per USDA law in order to travel. Once they have been certified they are then transported via USDA transport services only, which is required by law. \n We  sometimes don't understand how bad the situation is for these pups and dogs in southern states.  Many people in the south don't spay or neuter their pets as we do here. Subsequently, there are thousands of beautiful , worthy pups and dogs, kittens and cats  that are dumped, shot, abandoned, brought into shelters, neglected, abused and abandoned.  We step in , tend to their veterinary needs. As you can see above, we never fail to properly spay and neuter. Everything is done with the  caring , capable hands of our veterinarians to get them healthy and ready to place them for adoption. That's when we put the demand for family- friendly pets with the supply ..... \n\nGive a first rate dog a second chance!!!! ADOPT! \n\n\nKeep in mind that we also offer a two week return policy for the return of a healthy dog that includes a full refund. We want to make sure that the adoption is a perfect fit for both you and the dog.\n\nIf you would like more information about adopting please select \"More About Little Rhody Rescue\" where you will also find our online application if you'd like to proceed with the adoption process. Thank you!",

            "description": "\"Trek\" is around 2 years old, a Mountain Cur and Pit mix, around 45 pounds.  Neutered, vaccinated and heartworm tested.  He gets along with other dogs, is probably too big for small children but older, respectful kids would be fine.  NO cats!\nTrek was surrendered by his owner because she allowed him to roam the neighborhood and she was going to start getting citations for a dog at large.  Trek came into animal control fearful and aggressive.  The animal control officer worked with him and after several days, he showed his true colors....a big playful softie.  Trek is in a foster home now and has been a joy to have around.  He's housebroken and gentle.  Walks nicely on a leash and is getting along very well with another much smaller foster dog.  No problems with meeting new people while on walks.  Not pesky when you're trying to eat and he takes treats gently.  Was cooperative getting a bath, even though he really didn't like it much!  If you'd like to have a meet 'n greet with Trek call Friends of Horseshoe Bend Animals at 870-373-2649 or shoot us a message.  Adoption fee is $30.",

I\u2019m Tanner McGhee and I\u2019m on the hunt for a wonderful home.   \nTanner is a stunning walker hound who is still just a pup at barely 12 months old.  He is energetic,  playful, and super sweet!   Although he is a house pet, he requires a securely fenced yard  to run off his energy (which he has plenty off right now).\nHe is doing good.walking with his gentle leader.  He would love a family that routinely walks, jogs, and spends time outdoors  \nHounds are loving and loyal dogs!   They have comical personalities and make fantastic pets.  He is great with kids and other dogs NO CATS.\nIf you\u2019re active, have an above ground secure fence, don\u2019t have cats, and are willing to work with a young sweet floppy ear hound please apply!   We do adopt out of state however we do not put our dogs on transport.  \nHe is neutered, vaccinated, and on HW prevention.  \nApply here to adopt or foster \nhttps://forms.gle/i6vCT6447Eew8NCg9\n\n\n",

He does seem to have a few issues with other large male dogs so we need to be cautious with what home he goes to if there is another dog in the home.  He is a big boy at 72 lbs.\n\nHe is neutered, current on shots.  He has been treated for heartworm and the treatment is complete.  We were told he is great with adults and kids.  We were also told he is housebroken.\n\nWe have no cat information. \n\nHis adoption fee will be $150.00. \n\nHe is available to go home.  \n\nIn order to adopt you have to complete an adoption application - you will find that on our website at www.patriotsforpets.com under the 'Adoption' tab.",

Don has a curious personality and loves exploring new spaces. If you have another dog in the home, Don will need to meet them before going home. \n\nAge: 2-3 years\nSex: Male\nWeight: 53 lbs\nHW +",

            "description": "Tazzy was found alone in an apartment complex in December 2020. I took her in to foster her. She is young, very playful, and she is teething at the moment. She does not like to be loved on too much, she thinks she is independent. She also does not like to be alone. I have other dogs and cats that she likes to play with and be around. Taz likes to chase my cats around the house, she is learning her boundaries with them. Taz sleeps well in her kennel, but she does not like to be in it when she is not asleep.\n\nTazzy is available for foster to adopt in the Greater Houston area only. Apply at hhfrescue.org.The adoption fee includes vaccinations, bordetella, deworming, rabies, spay/neuter, microchip, a lifetime registration of the microchip, and sales tax. If adopting a puppy, the rabies and spay/neuter will be done at the same time by our vet once they are 4 months old and billed to us. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.",

I need slow intros and space!\nGood with Cats? I like them more than they like me! (\nDog-savvy cats may be okay)\n\nGood with Kids? I love little ones!\nGood with Strangers?\nI need slow intros and space!\n\nPotty Trained?\nI'm a puppy so I'm still learning!\n\nCrate Trained?\nI bark some, but quiet down quickly!\n\nInterested? Learn more about Cinnabon Delight below!\n\nAbout Cinnabon Delight:\n\nMy name is Cinnabon Delight! I am a 3 month old Lab mix. I'm sweet, playful, curious, and active. I'm working on my potty training. I usually go to the door and make it outside in time. I'm comfortable sleeping in my crate, but I don't want to be in there if there's fun to be had! Recently, I got the chance to meet some other dogs. I was timid and shy when I first met them, but once I had some time and space, it was a lot of fun! I have met a family cat, and we had a lot of time figuring each other out. But it seems like I like her more than she likes me! My foster mom taught me to sit and stay, and I've gotten really good at it! She has me do it before going out and before my meals. I have started to walk on a leash and am getting better each time! I am a puppy and still learning to come. I love playing with my foster mom and her daughter, they both play games with me and let me run after they throw my toys around. After a long day, I like to snuggle up!\n\nAdoption Fee: $550\n\nTraining Requirement: Obedience Training Level 1\n\n*Foster to Adopt: I am looking for a forever home now, but I still need all my puppy shots and to be spayed! So I'm looking for a family that will be able to commit to bringing me to all of my appointments with TCPR until I'm ready to be fully adopted by you!\n\nMEET ME/ADOPT ME: If you'd like to arrange a meeting or begin the adoption process, please fill out an adoption application by visiting www.twincitiespetrescue.org/adopt/adopt-a-dog/ . A volunteer from Twin Cities Pet Rescue will contact you once your application is reviewed.\n\nFOSTER HOMES NEEDED!!! Twin Cities Pet Rescue is a volunteer-run, foster home-based organization.
