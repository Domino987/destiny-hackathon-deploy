            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Bacall (GA) is a spayed 2 year old female Labrador Retriever mix rescued in Georgia from a neglectful life where she was living strictly outside with many other dogs. She had no human contact and never heard a kind word or felt a gentle touch. Bacall is a sweet pup, but she is a bit overwhelmed at all that her new life has to offer. For that reason, Bacall needs a kind, patient forever family who will give her a quiet, safe environment and the space and time she needs to adjust. Her forever home must have a fenced yard. She likes other dogs but is pretty much a 'velcro' dog with her humans, always wanting to be near them. At this time, we believe a home without young children would be best for Bacall. If you have it in your heart to lead and support Bacall in her journey to a happy life, please apply online to adopt Bacall (GA) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

            "description": "Teddy, an approx 1 year old red pitbull mix is looking for his forever home. He was neutered and vetted yesterday. He walks pretty well on a leash but he is a strong guy who hasn't learned all of his manners yet. He was raised with kids but probably older kids would be best as Teddy has a lot of energy and is very rambunctious. An active home would be great for him. He will need training as he really never got any..he was just left to his own devices and that just leads to an unruly dog. He is slowly learning that he doesn't get to do whatever he wants here but that will need to continue to be reinforced. He has been around other dogs, was raised with them but would probably do best with dogs his size or larger. He can be food aggressive but was very skinny when he came to us so resource guarding became important to him so that he wouldn't starve. He does understand that he must wait when being fed, if you make him wait before feeding. He has no food aggression towards people that we have seen, only other dogs. This should be able to be overcome with regular meals and getting him over feeling that he needs to guard his food or starve to death. Feeding separately is also an option. We do not know how Teddy does with cats. As far as we know, he has had zero experience with cats.He would probably chase them so a home without cats is recommended. With patience and consistency,  Teddy will make an awesome companion. He is a young guy with lots of potential!! Teddy's adoption fee will be $175.00 and will help to cover his neuter, vetting and cost of care while with us. If interested in giving Teddy his forever home, please complete our adoption application and email your interest. You may also text ONLY to 352-215-3260 (phone calls will not be answered or returned from this number), FB message us or call 352-493-1255(please leave a message at this number if no answer. Text, email or FB message is best for quickest response.",

Her previous owners stated she lived with children and a cat and did well - she's a bit nervous at first so older children would most likely be best.

She was rescued from a really bad home where she lived outside with two other Great Danes, a 6-year-old black male and her sister, Annie. The owner needed money for rent (and alcohol), so he agreed to sell his dogs to a good Samaritan who was determined to get these dogs away from the horrible place they were kept.\n\nEmmy Lou is very sweet and loving. She is now current on vaccinations and she is HW neg. She is scheduled to be spayed on Jan. 29th, after which she will be ready to go to a new forever loving home.\n\nIf you are an experienced Dane owner and you have would like to give Emmy Lou a new home, where she will get the care, attention and love she needs, please go to our website and fill out the adoption application.",

She was rescued from a really bad home where she lived outside with two other Great Danes, a 6-year-old black male and her sister, Emmy Lou.  The owner needed money for rent (and alcohol), so he agreed to sell his dogs to a good Samaritan who was determined to get these dogs away from the horrible place they were kept.  \n\nAnnie is very sweet and loving.  She is now current on vaccinations and she is HW neg.  She is scheduled to be spayed on Jan. 29th, after which she will be ready to go to a new forever loving home.  \n\nIf you are an experienced Dane owner and you have would like to give Annie a new home, where she will get the care, attention and love she needs, please go to our website and fill out the adoption application.",

Unfortunately, Brutus is heartworm positive, and we need to raise $320 for his treatment before he can be adopted. If you would like to make a donation towards his adoption, please donate at https://humanesocietynmb.org/give/ (just indicate it's for Brutus), or you can stop by the shelter.",

Based on the size of his head we think he's a mix with mastiff, but his body is normal size as a Labrador.   He came to us after living his entire life on a chain outside.  He's doing great in his foster home getting all the attention. He does ok with  other dogs, prefers to be the only dog in the home. And no  cats.  He needs a quieter home with maybe someone who works from home and older kids. .  He loves his walks, but pretty chilled.  He's a cuddler and loves his humans.  He takes treats nicely and free feeds.  He rides nicely in a car. From the pictures you can see his colorful belly bands. Since he's been outside his entire life potty training took a little longer, but now he's doing well.  His tail appears half the length of a normal tail so we assume some type of previous injury. He's a good boy looking for his forever home. Chocolate is fostered in Crystal, MI.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting and possibly adopting any of our dogs, please visit https://3clr.org/adoption-process to read through our process and requirements.Adoption Fee: $350, which includes spay/neuter, age-appropriate vaccinations, up-to-date monthly heartworm preventative and microchip with lifetime enrollment. One of our volunteers will send you an application to fill out.\n",

DOB tbd), male, 58 lbs., vetted, is or will be neutered, and micro-chipped. Max was living life on a chain and was a product of a relationship parting along with Missy and Princess.\n\nIN HIS CURRENT DAYCARE/BOARDING ENVIRONMENT (we make no guarantees starting over in a new dynamic):\n\nGood with Dogs? Yes\n\nGood with Cats? NO\n\nHas a prey drive? Yes\n\nGood with smaller kids (mouthy, nippy, jumpy, chase, scared)? 5+ due to prey drive\n\nEnergy Level (low, low-medium, medium, medium-high, or high)? Medium+\n\nScared of people or socially outgoing? Outgoing\n\nNeeds another dog in the home (if scared of people), ok as only, or either way? Either way\n\nCrate trained? Kennel trained\n\nDoes he like the crate? Yes\n\nPotty trained? Clean in kennel\n\nChewer/destructive? No, but likes chew bones/chew toys in kennel\n\nSeparation Anxiety from people when left alone? No\n\nVocal? No very quiet\n\nBehavior on leash when walking near lots of people/dogs? Ok\n\nConcerning behavior: No\n\nBest in the busy City or rural calm or doesn't matter? Doesn't matter\n\nStay tuned for more information as Max is a new rescue!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Max please fill out an Application at\n\nwww.Passion-4-Paws.org\n\n(please make sure you have the Vermont site not CT) - thanks!\n\nPlease note Fosters have 1st option of Adoption.\n\nCheck out his Facebook page (please \"Like\" us while you are there)!\n\nDisclosure:\n\nBreed labels are often incorrect: we rarely know the genetic lineage of the dogs we rescue. Many shelters and rescues specify breeds based on appearance; however, research has shown that less than 2% of a dog's DNA determines appearance!\n\nPassion 4 Paws does not practice the use of labels pertaining to compatibility with others or dog breed. Labels such as \"dog friendly\" and \"child friendly\" should be used with caution as they often over-simplify the personalities and behavior of dogs.",

Unfortunately more downs than ups.\n\nHe was picked up as a stray in Laurinburg with a leg that had a bad old injury.  The leg just hung limp. But he was just the sweetest boy ever.  No one wanted to take this on from a rescue standpoint.  Humane Society of Union County agreed to take him in and get him the care he needed.  Once he visited our vet it was recommended he have his leg amputated. He had a rough surgery due to the fact the leg had been broken and healed in the wrong position.  He made it through the surgery and rehabbed with the vet that did the surgery.  He did great!\n\nAfter he healed we took him to several adoption events.  He did good at the events.  He found his FUREVER home.....well, that turned out not to work out.  Roo became to attached to his new owner.  This was a single lady.  \n\nShe was having a hard time with him being to protective.  We took him back and he returned just as happy and sweet as ever.  Maybe he wasn't in the best spot for him.  He needs a home with a leader that will keep him calm and focused.  We are offering a trainer to go along with the new owners to get him acclimated and get the right start. \n\nIf you would like to met him please complete a non binding application at HSUC.ORG and we will get right back to you.  Thank you so much for considering giving this very sweet boy a home!!!\n\n",

He does great with all kids but would do better in a home with older kids as the loud toys and screams kind of freak him out. He will play all day and night but as soon as you pick him and put him on the couch he just lays there and goes to sleep. He whines for a few minutes of putting him in his crate for bed but that's it until he is ready to be out the next day.\n\nIf youd like to adopt me, head over to eastcoastboxerrescue.org and apply to adopt me!",

            "description": "So often people look at photos of rescue dogs listed on shelter pages and say \"Hey, I think that is the dog for me\"!  And that is fine with the average dog. But we would really like you to look beyond Silas's gorgeous looks and read his bio thoroughly. It is important to us, and to the person who rescued him, to make sure he gets the perfect home for his specific needs.\n\nYou see, Silas was found as a stray after roaming a neighborhood for over 2 weeks. Maybe his owner allowed him to roam, or maybe he escaped a fenced yard. We just don't know. But we would like to make sure that his new owner either has a securely fenced yard (at least 5' high) or plans to give Silas a good deal of exercise on leash every day (maybe someone who wants a running partner or wants to add a dog to their daily walk). We will not hand him over to someone who plans to tie him in the yard or allow him to just run free.\n\nNext on the list of \"must haves\" is a house, not an apartment, that is located a good distance from the neighbors. This is because Silas doesn't bark, or at least he doesn't bark in the way you would generally think of. When Silas vocalizes it is more like a high pitched scream. It is kind of funny, but neighbors likely wouldn't find that to be the case.\n\nWe notice he makes the sounds mainly when he can't be with his people, and while we don't know for sure, we suspect it might be a bit of separation anxiety. So a home where someone is home often would be the best option. He definitely is not a dog that can be tied or kenneled in a yard without alarming the neighborhood.\n\nSilas's adopter will need to be prepared to go through training the basics. He will need to learn all the common commands such as \"Stay\", \"Down\" and \"Come\". \"Heel\" would be a nice bonus as well.  He already knows \"Sit\" and is VERY food motivated so training will be a breeze.  He takes treats so gently!  It would be great if his adopter could take Silas to local training classes. This can be fun for both the owner and the dog and it helps form a bond that will last a lifetime!\n\nNow that the 'Must Haves' have been established we will tell you a bit more about this handsome fellow. Silas is about 4-1/2 years old. He has a very striking look, with a white head on a blue body. His ears are the cutest, standing up straight and tipping ever so slightly at the top. Silas just LOVES attention, never passing up a belly rub. We suspect that he is housebroken but do not know if he is crate trained.\n\nSilas is about 50 pounds which is a nice size. But typical of his breed, that 50 lbs is all muscle and he tends to pull a lot on leash. We would recommend the use of a Gentle Leader Easy walk harness (it latches in the front). We all know it is no fun walking a dog that pulls, but there are plenty of great collar and harness options that could be employed to help with this.\n\nSilas most definitely can not live with cats. There is no easier way to put it. A cat and Silas would not make good housemates! He is not aggressive with other dogs, however, he has a very overwhelming personality with other dogs and they often don't like it. Have you ever been in the presence of someone obnoxious and you couldn't wait to leave the room? Well this is the way other dogs sometimes feel about Silas. It may be his vocalizing or maybe he is a little too 'in your face' for some dogs. Whatever it is we feel he would likely do best as an only dog in his new home.\n\nWe have found Silas to be good with children but he would likely be too much for younger kids. He is built like a brick and is as bouncy as a rabbit so children over the age of 10 would be recommended.\n\nNow that you know what we would love to see for this sweet boy we can assure you that he is a sweet and loving soul who just needs the guidance he lacked in his early life. We just love him and know he is a diamond in the rough. Once polished he will shine so bright!\n\nPLEASE NOTE:    DO NOT CALL THE SHELTER!!!   \nIf you have questions please EMAIL:  HSPCdogs@gmail.com   \nWe are open for adoptions Thursday - Saturday from 12-4pm (excluding holidays).  Adoptions are on a first come, first serve basis.  Adoption fee is $100 (cash or check only, NO credit cards).   Meet and greets with kids and other dogs are required.\n",

            "description": "1 and a half years old. 53 lbs. Female yellow labrador mix. House trained. An affectionate girl who thinks she's a lap dog! Vanilla was turned in to us from a home; the reason was that she had too much energy for their small property. She lived with children who took her for walks. Her family said she is generally well behaved, but sometimes she can get too excited. She may chew things when left alone, and she can jump fences.\n\nShe was the only dog in the home, though she did well when meeting dogs at the vet or on walks.\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment. Please look at our website and make a list of one or more dogs that you would like to see.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf you have a question about adopting, giving up a dog, boarding, or volunteering, please visit the appropriate tabs on our\nhome page.\n\nFor more specific questions, call 626-444-9664 (please leave a voicemail if no answer) or email at beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Note that\nEmailing\nis always preferred!\n\nThanks!\n\nPlease note: If you are viewing this profile anywhere other than Beagles & Buddies own website, you are not receiving full info.

She even greets and gives kisses to visitors, actually, loves giving kisses to everyone!  9 years old, and weighs about 68 pounds.   We do not know about little kids, but we can test her.  Honey wants to be the only pet in the home.  She is being rehomed because owner cannot care for her due to personal issues so honey is with owner's parents, and has conflicts with their dogs.  She is pretty laid back, will play ball out in the yard, and pretty much lays around on the couch with you when she is inside.  She is well mannered and trained, healthy and happy and takes treats nicely.   She does pull on leash if you like to walk when she sees other dogs, so a harness or gentle leader may help.  She is a great dog.  If you would like more info, or like to meet her, please contact me.  thanks for loving Honey.  Asking 100. Donation.",

DOB tbd), female, 67 lbs., vetted, is or will be spayed, and micro-chipped. Princess was living life on a chain and was a product of a relationship parting along with Missy and Max.\n\nIN HER CURRENT DAYCARE/BOARDING ENVIRONMENT (we make no guarantees starting over in a new dynamic):\n\nGood with Dogs? Yes\n\nGood with Cats? NO\n\nHas a prey drive? Yes\n\nGood with smaller kids (mouthy, nippy, jumpy, chase, scared)? Should be ok w kids\n\nEnergy Level (low, low-medium, medium, medium-high, or high)? Medium+\n\nScared of people or socially outgoing? Outgoing\n\nNeeds another dog in the home (if scared of people), ok as only, or either way? Either way\n\nCrate trained? Yes\n\nDoes she like the crate? Yes\n\nPotty trained? Clean in Kennel\n\nSeparation Anxiety from people when left alone? No\n\nVocal? When excited\n\nBehavior on leash when walking near lots of people/dogs? Ok\n\nConcerning behavior: None - nice dog, beautiful, white as snow\n\nBest in the busy City or rural calm or doesn't matter? Fine either way\n\nStay tuned for more information as Princess is a new rescue!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Princess please fill out an Application at\n\nwww.Passion-4-Paws.org\n\n(please make sure you have the Vermont site not CT) - thanks!\n\nPlease note Fosters have 1st option of Adoption.\n\nCheck out her Facebook page (please \"Like\" us while you are there)!\n\nDisclosure:\n\nBreed labels are often incorrect: we rarely know the genetic lineage of the dogs we rescue. Many shelters and rescues specify breeds based on appearance; however, research has shown that less than 2% of a dog's DNA determines appearance!\n\nPassion 4 Paws does not practice the use of labels pertaining to compatibility with others or dog breed. Labels such as \"dog friendly\" and \"child friendly\" should be used with caution as they often over-simplify the personalities and behavior of dogs.",

I love to play fetch  and run around in the yard. I am good with dogs and cats but sometimes don't understand how big I am and can be a little rough on accident. So dogs my size that are ok to rough house would be good. I am very good about not going potty in the house and will let you know when I need to go out. I just want a good loving family to spend the rest of my years with.\n\n**If interested please fill out an application on our website www.mendingheartsrescue.org and we can set up a time to meet them, as we are a foster based rescue**\n\n**adoptions fees include spay/neuter, microchip, vaccines, heartworm check for dogs, FeLV test for cats, and flea/heartworm prevention**",

She is fostering with other dogs but typically does not play with them. Don't think she learned how yet.\n\nVery intelligent, very stubborn, medium to high energy,  Was trained with a training collar and some improper use of it by newcomers to her world. Now being trained with positive reinforcement and learning she won't get hurt. She's responding well so far. More details to any serious prospective candidates that have experience and a calm environment.\n\nDoes have a loud voice (typically barks not bays) when she wants something and would not be a good apartment dog.   High prey drive and will rid your yard of any critters or cats.  Thin build like a doberman (Greyhound?) but strong and likes to drag her walker. Working on that next!\n\nShe is going on 2 years old. Pictures will follow soon. She's black with tan. Ideal weight around 55 pounds.\n\nSpayed and vaccinated.\n\nNot recommended with small or timid children at this time. She is \"scary\" with her barking when she's upset but we have been concentrating on that and she is improving greatly. She has not bitten but is intimidating until you get to know her. (Great against intruders though!!).\n\nPlease email petangels@gmail.com or text 7346457705 if you might be a good fit to help her continue learning to love again.",

            "description": "Meet Rufus!\n\nRufus is a character and anyone that meets him is bound to love him!  If you want some laughter in your life you will love this one.   He is a SUPER playful and spunky pup.  He loves to play with other dogs, toys and the people in his foster home.  The foster has a lot of great stories about this goofy dude to share in the short time they have had him already.\n\nHere is a video of him from day one in their home playing with one of the kids in the foster home: https://youtu.be/HP1u-NsEEA0     \n\nHe is a very friendly dog.  Great with other dogs.  So if you are looking for a buddy for your current dog he is a contender.  Walks well on a leash.  Foster hasn't heard him bark yet.   \nHe demands attention! lol!  He will rub his face up against you and put his paws on you asking for pets.  \n\nHe is an active and fun dog.  If you would like a running buddy he would enjoy runs.  If you are not a runner he would enjoy daily walks and trips to the local dog park so he can get his zoomies out.  \n\nYou can see from the pictures he does have a little cute crooked face.  Unsure of what happened, but it does give him character.\n\nHe was pulled from a local rural shelter in the Houston area by one of our rescue partners so we don't have much background history on him.\n\nHe is now here with a foster in Dyer, IN and is looking for a home of his own.\n\nWe are guessing he is a young adult - 1 or 2 yrs old, 75lbs, neutered, up to date on vaccines and rabies.\n\nAdoption Process:\n\n- please fill out our adoption application: https://www.dayofthedogs.org/adoption-application\n\n- one of our team members will get back to you. \n\n- our dogs can be seen by appointment only after an approved application has been received.\n\n- Adoption fee helps to cover his neuter, initial vaccines, rabies, initial worming, and microchip.\n\n-We cannot place holds on our dogs. Please do not contact us until you are prepared to adopt.\n\nNOTE:  We are very good about updating the pet's profiles once adopted.  So no need to write us to ask \"Is he/she still available?\"  If the post is up, the dog is still available. \n\nAbout Us:\nDay of the Dogs is a 501c3 nonprofit that is dedicated to helping shelters increase live release.  We coordinate 2 - 4 transports per month from TX, OK and AR to NW Indiana/Chicagoland area.  We do direct adoptions ourselves out of Dyer, IN area and partner with 12 other rescues and shelters in both IL and IN that are willing to help southern pets in need.   \nWe rely on donations to help fund our ongoing transports.  Please donate if you can.  Every dollar adds up and we are grateful for any help we can get: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/DayoftheDogs\n\n\n\n",

I would probably do best with older children if any. I have been described to be very friendly. **Please apply on our website at indy.gov/activity/adopt-a-pet. Go to the website, click on the adoption application link, enter the information and hit submit. After the application is submitted a staff member will contact you within 48 hours.

My foster mom trusts me in the house uncrated and I am doing great with house training (I learned to go to the door to give her my signal). But I am also mischievous because I'm still puppy-like. Favorite past-times.....playing with my canine friends and snuggling with my humans. I do have energy so I will need a fenced yard. I would not do well in an apartment setting. My foster mom says I'm like a deer....I can leap and jump like one. I love to take snuggle naps especially if you have a fleece blanket! I'm still young and would love to find my forever home soon so that I continue to blossom into the perfect forever friend!\n\n(AF/AF)\n\nUp to date on age-appropriate vaccines, neutered and micro-chipped.\n\nAdoption Fee: $200.00",

            "description": "Meet Wesley (aka: Paki).  Wesley is a 3 year old male Shepherd/Collie/??  mix.  Wesley came from an overcrowded shelter.  He is a medium sized dog at about 35 pounds and is full grown.  He is an absolute love bug and wants to be with his human(s) and make them proud of him.  Wesley is extremely smart and loves learning new things.  He is learning to play with the other dogs in the foster home as well as learning what toys and treats are all about.  However, his absolute favorite thing in the world is to be close to his family.  Wesley is learning some basic commands such as sit, down, wait, off, crate, etc.  Wesley loves to be out in the fully fenced back yard, playing in the snow.  He is OK playing in the yard by himself but really enjoys having one of the resident dogs or a human outside with him.  Wesley still has a lot of young dog energy and has a habit of jumping up to greet people and give them a hug (literally hugs people around the waist).  The foster is working with Wesley to train this as a command, and that he is to sit and wait for people to pet him (as opposed to him jumping up on them) - he\u2019s really catching on to this well.  Wesley is crate trained for a full 8 hour work day, and is reliably housebroken once he learns the routine in his home and where he\u2019s supposed to go outside. Although Wesley will go into his crate willingly, and is OK in his crate, it\u2019s not his favorite place to be and he will bark when he hears noises so he would not be suited for an environment with shared walls / ceilings / floors as he does bark periodically throughout the day when he hears things outside.  Wesley is a bit nervous in new environments and also gets excited to see his human(s) when they come home. Given the fact that Wesley is an active dog, a fully fenced yard will be a requirement for his forever family.  Wesley has been great with all humans and dogs he has met.  Given his energetic personality and that he still jumps to greet people occasionally, a home without young children or individuals unsteady on their feet will be best.  We expect children approximately 8 years of age and up will be OK.  Wesley would do well in a home with another playful dog, and would also do well as an only dog as long as his forever family is familiar with shy dogs and their socialization needs.  Wesley is extremely smart and wants to make his humans proud of him so obedience class would be a great way to build his confidence and build a lasting bond with his family.  Wesley was heartworm positive on intake and has completed his treatment for this.  He will need to remain on oral heartworm medication and will need a follow up heartworm test in May 2021, which will be free of charge if completed at Life Care Animal Hospital.  Wesley is current on his rabies and distemper vaccinations and his microchip is registered to Second Chance.  Wesley is a sweet dog who has so much love to give to his forever family.  The adoption fee for him is $395.   If you would like to learn more about Wesley, please contact us at 651-771-5662. Remember\u2026\u2026. adopter must have a secure fenced yard and not live in an apartment or condo.",

Juude is being a great mom! There are 6 boys and 6 girls. Some are blue, and some are a light, dusted cinnamon color! We will have them up on Petfinder soon, as we are accepting applicatios now! Jude just came to us on 1-16-21. She is, as you can see, about to have several babies! She will have an ultrasound on 1-18-21 so we can make sure everything looks good and see about how many babies we are expecting, and when they might be here! We are thinking she has about another week, but will know more after her ultrasound. She is as sweet as she can be and looks alot like a silver Lab. Rides like a dream in the car! We are taking applications for the babies now and get people pre approved so they can pick when the babies get here!",

He just uses it to get treats! \n\nHe's a happy, affectionate pup who adores humans, and is game for car rides, playing, cuddling (on your lap if you'll let him), snacking, and just being with his people. He's also a fan of toys, treats and bones. \n\nTank is housetrained and a perfect gentleman when left alone in the home when his humans are gone. He doesn't even require a crate! He will greet you upon your return with full-body wiggles and even the cutest \"ah-ROOOO\" when he's especially excited. Tank is a very laid back, and some would say lazy, pooch, but he does get the pit bull zoomies on occasion. He's pretty darned irresistible, really. \n\nTank is very in tune with his humans' emotions and loves to wiggle with you when you celebrate, or snuggle you all day when you're not feeling well.  \n\nTank gets along great with kids, but he's a door dasher so would be best in a home with older or no kids so that he doesn't escape through a door inadvertently left ajar. Tank prefers to be the only dog in your home. \n\nHis family loves him so much, but they have health issues and can no longer care for him.

We rescued this sweet girl from being euthanized at a vet's office by her owner. The reasons were unclear. We got a call asking if we could save her. Because this was an emergency, we took her immediately and brought her to boarding at CARL (No open foster homes).\nChevi is a super sweet, affectionate girl who gives lots of kisses! She even loves to sit against you or kind of on your lap, if she can, lol... Chevi is a little scared of some men, although she has loved the male vets and male vet techs she has met!\nChevi is only 3 1/2 years old, and is a beautiful girl. Unfortunately, we have noticed that she is having pain walking, and that she has been limping more and more, and not wanting to walk. We just got her in for an orthopedic exam and consult, and found out that she has ACL tears in both legs and needs bilateral TPLO surgery. We URGENTLY need to raise $10,000 to cover her surgery and pre-surgery tests and meds. We already have Chevi on several pain meds, joint support, CBD, fish oil, and Adequan injections, so her medical bills have been mounting fast.\nCONTACT info@allforloveanimalrescue.org to help CHEVI\n805-445-3535\n\n",

I love to sleep in in the mornings & to take my time doing things. So if you like to take your time in the mornings, I might be the perfect buddy for you! I really enjoy being outside, so a home with a fenced yard would be fantastic! But it's not necessary.  I walk great on a leash  & I love walks! I also love to play with my blankie & to roll around on my back! I'm ADORABLE when I do that! I really need a home with no steps (or just 2 or 3 to get outside) since I'm partially blind & I become afraid. It's very hard having to go to a new home & being older & not being able to see much. I ride great in a car. Just secure me to the back seat, & I'll just enjoy the ride. I belonged to a person who had to go into a nursing home & I was going to be euthanized, but this kind woman offered to take me. She thinks I probably lived outdoors. She was able to teach me house manners & I made great progress on housetraining. (I poop outside!) But I still need some work. I'm in a temporary foster home with other dogs & a cat, & children as young as 8 years & I do fine with everyone. But my foster home has stairs, & I really need a home with no steps (or just a few). Occasionally I will randomly bark, but that is decreasing the more familiar I become with my foster home.  I become with So I need a long-term/permanent foster home or an adoptive home. I'm anxious to find my forever home! I probably weight about 40 or 45 lbs. Please think about making me part of your family! I will warm your heart once you get to know me!",

A mix between boxer and the Little Rascal's dog, Kammie is a sweet and gentle soul who just arrived at the farm quiet as a mouse and is building her confidence daily, venturing into dog fun and pets and schmoozing with the volunteers, quickly become a fav on the farm. Kammie is definitely a mix, at about a year or so old, Kammie weighs around 45 lbs full grown. Kammie would love to move into a home with another dog as she is still unsure of lots of things and does well with the guidance of doggo friends. That being said, she also really loves attention being showered on her and would also do well with folks who have patience while she settles in as well as some interest in confidence-building activities like training.\nShe has shown some interest in stuffed toys, and we\nthink once she gets more confident, she would love to play!\n\nShe's an incredibly sweet and gentle girl with good house manners.\n\nHer favorite things to do are nap and watch TV, and she loves treats! At bedtime she will go right in her crate and not make a peep.\nKammie is ready to move onto a life in quiet suburbia that involves all of the niceties and luxuries she has yet to have experienced. There is a big world of wonderful out there and she is ready for it!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

            "description": "Meet Theo! He is a sweet boy who is looking for a home with adults only. He would love a home that is active and can provide lots of exercise. He is not dog friendly and would do better in a home that is in a rural setting where there is not many dogs, small animals walking around. He would love a home with big yard that he can run around in and be silly! He loves to go in the car and will try to make his way up to front seat to sit next to you! He needs owners who have had lots of experience with dogs as he does have some quirks to him, but with the right home, training and confidence, he will make an amazing new addition to your family! He is allergic to some food and currently only eating a specific brand, we ask that if you adopt him to please keep him on that food. He has been taking medicated baths every 3 days and it helps with his allergies as well. He doesn't like to be left alone, so preferably a retired couple or a home where someone is always home will be best for him. \n\n\n\nFoster notes: \nTheo is curious and loves to cuddle and play with humans. He also likes to sleep in the room with his people, and if you allow him on the bed, he gradually will take over it, cuddling closer and closer. \nTheo is the kind of dog who will notice when we're working long hours without moving and ask us to take a break and play with him - by pushing his nose under our elbow.\nHis favorite games generally involve running all over the place. He doesn't play fetch, but he runs with us around our backyard. Theo sprints back and forth. He also likes to pull on a thick rope while we hold the other end.\nWhen he gets very excited, he runs to the living room, jumps on the couch, jumps off of it from the other and sprints back around the coffee table to jump on again. He can spend several minutes in total excitement running in a circle like this.\n\nHe gets anxious around other dogs and chases cats and squirrels. In a new home, we'd suggest avoiding other dogs and give Theo treats when dogs are in his proximity, say \"yes! when giving the treat. With this approach, 95+% of the time he will be fine with the other dog passing by.\n\nWe have seen significant improvement in his behavior (which primarily was separation anxiety and aggression towards other dogs), which our friends and family have also noticed and are able to share with you. We have not seen resource guarding issues at all in over two years, and have been able to take him on hikes and trips all over California. Occasionally, we introduced him to dogs in our neighborhood and were able to have another dog with him on his walks. He has been calm and affectionate, sensitive, smart, and happy.\n\nWe have been working with a trainer recommended by the Milo Foundation to gradually address his issues. We've also met with a dog behaviorist.\nCommands Theo knows: \"Leave it\", \"Yes\" \"No\", \"Off\", \"Come\", \"Go away\", \"Out\", \"Up, \"Down\", \"Sit\", \"Touch\". He also responds well to descriptions of what's about to happen (e.g. \"we're going to brush your teeth) and shows a general interest in communicating and listening to us. Even if he doesn't understand, he'll make an effort to interact.\n\nApply today to meet this amazing fellow. Adult only home with experienced owners",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Bogie (GA) is a neutered male Shepherd/Hound mix rescued in Georgia. Our veterinary partner estimates Bogie to be 2 years old at the time of intake in January 2021. Bogie is good with other dogs. We took Bogie out of a hoarding situation where he was living outside with many other dogs but with little, if any, human socialization. Bogie is a sweet boy, but he is understandably unsure of the attention he is receiving from humans for the first time in his life. For that reason, Bogie needs a forever person who will have patience and afford him the time he will need to\ndecompress and learn the skills he needs in a quiet, safe environment. A confident, friendly and not pushy doggy sibling would be a plus for Bogie's forever home. At this time, we believe a home without little children would be best for Bogie. If you are that special person who can open your heart to Bogie and help him adjust to a happy life, please apply online to adopt Bogie (GA) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

We were going to be euthanized, but this kind woman offered to take Spot & me. She thinks we probably lived outdoors. She was able to teach us house manners & we made great progress on housetraining (we poop outside now). But we still need work. Its very hard to housetrain 2 dogs at once, and so Nittany Beagle Rescue will place Buddy & Spot in separate homes. (You can read about Spot's own set of issues & his need for a special home). But I love to play & be loved! I have a corky personality! I'm also very sweet & gentle! I still need some work on house manners, but I learn quickly, especially if someone can focus on me 1-on-1! I've lived in a home with Spot & another dog & several cats, & I did fine with them. I'm crate trained. I will be neutered before I'm adopted. Please think about making me part of your family! I'm living in a boarding kennel now. I'm anxious to find my forever home - or a foster home while I wait for my forever home to come!",

Not as much of a roamer as a Husky.\n\nStella is very smart & very focused on her people. She wants to please and will be a great dog to train!  She does need some polish but is learning the basics quickly.  She has a nice recall & wants to stay in close proximity to her person.\n\nShe plays a little rough & tumble which can be a bit much for a little dog but she will do well with a dog that is okay with her puppy exuberance.\n\nStella would be a wonderful hiking companion.. She might even be a good contender for Agility or other K-9 sports. She will settle quietly at your feet when it's time to calm down.\n\nIf you like the smart, velcro dog that wants/needs to learn and you have the life style that can incorporate a dog into your daily schedule - this girl is one to consider!  She is going to be a memorable pet.\n\nAPPLICATIONS BEING ACCEPTED NOW. (Online application available at www.savingpetsoneatatime.org)\n\nStats: Husky mix, spayed female, current on specific vaccinations; parasite control, and micro-chipped. Weight: 45 lbs. Age: 8-9 mos. old. Adoption rate: $400.00 each  (Cash or credit).\n                                            \nDogs maybe shown by appointment if Adoption Application reflects the desired home. \n\nThank you!",

            "description": "Daisy / F / 6 yrs / 80 lbs / Mastiff Shepherd Mix / Toronto\n\nMeet Daisy! Daisy is described as a sweet and gentle girl who despite her size, is a total lush. She is loyal, eager to please, and more than ready for the right family to expose her full potential. Daisy has not always had the community of people currently advocating for her success, but we are confident that with the right leadership her true nature will shine through.\n\nDaisy\u2019s foster describes her as loyal and hilariously vocal when she greets people she trusts. Generally she is calm and gentle, and likes to be close to her people. Her playful side comes out in bursts, where she loves to dart around the backyard.\n\nDaisy is insecure and will need ongoing support from her forever family. In her amazing foster home, she has done well and taken steps in the right direction. She is currently being muzzle trained, and it is advised this continues in her forever home. She will require more time than your average dog to decompress in a new environment and begin to trust her new family. Once she is comfortable, training can start to build her confidence and socialization. She is truly a people pleaser, and very sensitive, so only positive reinforcement based training will be permissible for her success.\n\nDaisy's new family will have large dog experience and live in a low traffic area like the suburbs. Her fosters need to remain at least 25 meters from other dogs for Daisy's safety, and the safety of other dogs. Due to this, Daisy will not be suitable for condo or apartment living.\n\nDaisy is medium energy and would do best in a home that can provide her with smaller walks throughout the day, as well as time in the backyard to use the washroom. Daisy is reactive on leash, so she will require a strong and calm leader. When she sees other dogs, she pulls and barks and therefore will require an adopter who is committed to redirecting her attention with treats or a toy when she sees other dogs on walks. New environments and situations are very stressful for Daisy, including walks. She is best walked for shorter periods, in areas where she will have less exposure to triggers. This training will be ongoing, and will require time and patience to help her overcome her insecurities.\n\nTrue to her breed, she is smart and eager to please. Daisy knows sit, lie down, stay, recall, paw and other fundamental basic commands she is working on in her foster home. Continuing her obedience and trick training will be an important part of confidence building over time.\n\nDaisy is house trained and can be trusted with free reign when left alone. She is not crate trained but chills out in her dog bed or on her favorite part of the couch. When you come home she may bark out of excitement to greet you but settles quickly as long as unbalanced energy is not rewarded. She has not been left alone much, but has shown signs of separation anxiety when she is left alone by whining or crying. Her forever family should be prepared to deal with this as part of her ongoing training.\n\nDaisy\u2019s ideal family will live in a detached, low traffic home as too many visitors in the beginning could potentially hinder her success. Given she is fearful of loud or unexpected movements and noises, she is looking for a home without children or other pets.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adopting Daisy, please apply at https://www.fetchandreleash.ca/adoption-info#adoption-form\n\nDaisy's adoption fee is $800 and will be donated towards sessions with a Fetch & Releash approved trainer.

She is also doggy door trained. Apartments and condos are not a good fit for Bonnie.\n\nCrate Trained: Yes\n\nSheds: No\n\nBarks: No\n\nCar Rides: She is nervous in the car\n\n\nBonnie is a beautiful full of life and loving girl. Bonnie is very playful with other dogs. She has lots of energy but also likes to cuddle and be loved on. Bonnie was rescued from the streets of a small village with a pack of 8 dogs. She was very emaciated. It\u2019s was apparent that she had just had a litter of puppies. Although no puppies were ever found. Bonnie has since gained weight and some muscle. \n\n\nBonnie has deformed legs --- Bonnie loves to play with other dogs. Although he can over do it at times. By the end of the day she is tired and worn out. She has shown some signs of discomfort (limping) when she over does it. Bonnie won\u2019t be able to hike or walk miles. She will need short walks and lower activity (she is a great couch snuggle buddy). She would also do well on some joint supplements and some anti inflammatory meds. \n\n\nShe has old trauma to her legs. Her left leg is worse than her right leg. One is an old fracture that healed wrong the other was from trauma being hit by a car. \n\n\nWe currently have her on a joint/bone supplement to help stop any bone deterioration or osteoporosis. Our vet in Mexico will send his report and the xrays, that we took on Bonnie's legs.\n\n\nCould you be her happily ever after?\n\n\nBonnie was rescued in Guadalajara, Mexico and fostered in Mexico through our organization \u201cThe MexiMutt Project\u201d (You can read more about our organization on Facebook and Instagram). Please keep in mind that our dogs are rescued off the streets or were living outside 24/7 --- so they are NOT always 100% housebroken and will need time to adjust and transition.\n\n\nAdoption fee is $550 - that covers all of the vaccines (DHLPP, Rabies and Bordetella), current on flea/tick treatment, fecal testing, deworming, sterilization (spay/neuter), Heartworm-Lyme-Ehrlichia-Anaplasma Blood Test, dental cleaning (if needed), Distemper and Parvo blood test to make sure the dog is disease-free, Health Certificate, Microchip with registration, grooming before transport and the flight transport from Guadalajara, Mexico to Portland, Oregon. We will also send the dog home with a brand new collar, ID tag, leash and a small bag of the kibble.\n\n\nFill out an online adoption application here: www.BAPBR.org\n\n\n*Please know that we are a 100% volunteer ran organization, with no paid employees and we work full time jobs and have our own families to care for as well. Due to the large number of applications we receive - we are not able to reply to everyone individually. If we think you are the right match for our dog, we will reach out to you and set up a meet and greet. Thank you in advance for understanding.",

She has shown some signs of discomfort (limping) when she over does it. Bonnie won\u2019t be able to hike or walk miles. She will need short walks and lower activity (she is a great couch snuggle buddy). She would also do well on some joint supplements and some anti inflammatory meds. Bonnie is currently on joint supplements and has shown major improvement. \n\nShe has old trauma to her legs. Her left leg is worse than her right leg. One is an old fracture that healed wrong the other leg was  trauma from being hit (by something or a car?) We don't know for sure. \n\nWe currently have her on a joint/bone supplement to help stop any bone deterioration or osteoporosis. Our vet in Mexico sent his report and the xrays, that we took on Bonnie's legs.",

I am not available to be adopted just yet but I am looking for a foster family to take me in and give me a nice place to relax before and after I have my babies! I will also need you to keep my babies and I for about 6 weeks after they are born, until we can return back to the shelter! Bonus, you get first pick of the litter if you fall in love with one of my babies, and if you fall in love with me, I can stay at your home forever too! Right now the shelter is just not a peaceful and calm environment for me and I would love to be comfortable in your home! I am the sweetest girl, and love to lay around. I prefer a home with no animals as they add to my pregnancy stress. If you think your home would be a good fit for me to have and raise my babies in, please give the shelter a call and come meet me any time!",

            "description": "Diego is a Great Pyrenees/Aussie mix. He came into rescue when he was hit by a car and finder took him in. Diego would prefer a female owner that is home often as he likes to be close to his person. He needs a slow intro to people as we think he was mistreated before he came into rescue so he is not trusting of new people. He is good with children, other dogs, and fine with cats with a slow introduction. He loves rope toys, bones and all treats! Diego does well on a leash and likes to play outside. Diego has always lived in a rural setting and would prefer that. We would prefer that too as chasing cars his how he injured his leg! \n\nDue to COVID Diego's appointment with an orthopedist for his hip was canceled. Diego had a check up on his leg recently and the vet said the hip has remodeled itself, he is getting along well and she would leave the leg alone, no surgery. His foster mom says he runs like the wind and he may only need pain meds once in awhile. Diego will come to you neutered, up to date on vaccinations, up to date on flea/tick preventives, and microchipped. \n\nApplicants must have a secure and visible fence. In order for your application to be approved you must pass a home check and a vet check which includes having at least a two year vet history. Diego can be adopted in Missouri and surrounding states: Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, and Arkansas. We are able to transport Diego to those states. If you would like to give Diego a furever home, please fill out an application on our website. \n\nBeing fostered in Springfield, MO area",

Willow and her puppies were living under a porch in the cold until they were rescued. She had the most adorable puppies (second picture)! All of her puppies have now been adopted.\n\n She is a sweet girl, residing in a foster home. Meeting her can be arranged with an approved adoption application.\n\nHere is some information from her foster mom:\n\nShe has her bed in the kitchen with all her toys and bones to keep her busy. She goes out in morning to go potty and run around the fenced yard then comes in to her toys. \n\nWhen foster mom is not working, Willow is outside with her in yard or with her in the house. \n\nShe lets me know when she wants to go out to potty. On days foster mom works, gone 8 hours, she does fine. She goes out as soon as foster mom gets home then she wants to be with her. \n\nShe is not destructive in any way and completely housebroken. \n\nShe is a active dog who loves to go for walks and car rides she loves to be with people.\n\nWillow is an escape artist and needs a 6 foot privacy fence in her new home - she has scaled a 4 foot one easily.\n\nInterested in adopting? Go on our website, triadspca.org and submit an application or call us at 336-375-3222.\n",

He is on medication for his kidney function.  *Sophie is around 19 pounds.\n\nI know. You look at us and all you see are two scared pups. I can't blame you. Lately, life has been pretty scary. You see, our owner surrendered us, and though we don't understand why, we're trying to start over. My name is Sophie and this is Snoopy, he is my best friend. I'll let you in on a little secret: Snoopy really needs me to look out for him. He's not very brave so I have to be brave for both of us, but that's what big sisters do. Okay, another little secret: Snoopy is not really my brother, but he's 11 and I'm about 7 so I think it works anyway because we been together all of our lives. Would it work for you? Would you come see us? We would love to meet you!\n\nIf you would like to meet one of our Homeless Pets at the Town and Country Veterinary Clinic it is best to fill out an application first and schedule an appt.

He is on medication for his kidney function. *Sophie around 19 pounds.\n\nI know. You look at us and all you see are two scared pups. I can't blame you. Lately, life has been pretty scary. You see, our owner surrendered us, and though we don't understand why, we're trying to start over. My name is Sophie and this is Snoopy, he is my best friend. I'll let you in on a little secret: Snoopy really needs me to look out for him. He's not very brave so I have to be brave for both of us, but that's what big sisters do. Okay, another little secret: Snoopy is not really my brother, but he's 11 and I'm about 7 so I think it works anyway because we been together all of our lives. Would it work for you? Would you come see us? We would love to meet you!\n\nIf you would like to meet one of our Homeless Pets at the Town and Country Veterinary Clinic it is best to fill out an application first and schedule an appt.

We are Millie & Charlie, an adorable puggle pair, looking for a family to help us ring in 2021.\n\nWe have been together our entire lives and need to stay together forever. When you see how sweet we are you will be happy to have 2 times the puggle love! \n\nWe are both 12 yrs old. Millie is a fawn female and weighs 21 pounds. Charlie is an apricot-colored male and weighs 24 lbs. They are both good with kids and dogs (we haven't seen them around cats, so we don't know about that). The love a good routine and are potty trained (they have even learned to use a doggie door). \n\nMillie is an adorable little floof! She is fairly independent. You will never have to watch the clock when she is around...she knows exactly when it is mealtime and will make sure to remind you!  In true puggle fashion she definitely thinks with her stomach. \n\nShe absolutely loves having her ears rubbed. \n\nShe is up to date on her vaccines, heartworm negative, and has had a dental.\n\nCharlie is a snuggler! If you are looking for a snuggle bug to curl up with you and a good book, he is your guy! If you sit down Charlie will figure out a way to sit next to you...and he is a leaner too. If there isn't room beside you, he will ask you to make room on your lap! You absolutely can't resist this sweet boy. \n\nHe is up to date on his vaccines and heartworm negative. He is beginning to show signs of some arthritis, but his mobility is excellent. \n\nIf you think Millie & Charlie might be a great fit for your family, please complete an adoption application today at https://pugrescueofflorida.org/adopt\n\nIf you love me but can't adopt me please consider making a donation to rescue to help pay medical bills for not just me but my fellow foster brothers and sisters.\n\nMy Rescue friends are working very hard to find me and the other foster pugs new homes, so please be sure to submit an application before contacting them.\n\nMore information and  applications are available at WWW.PUGRESCUEOFFLORIDA.ORG",

We think she may have been an indoor dog at one time, so she may be house trained. If not, it won't take her long to get the idea. Devon is calm around other dogs, so we think she can go into a multi-dog household. We don't know about cats, as we are a dog-only rescue. We also don't have children, so we can't comment on that, but - again - she seems very even-tempered. This is a dog that definitely deserves a chance at a happy home - maybe yours? Email Save the Strays if you would like more information on Devon.",

She\u2019s such an easy dog to have around. She is getting more comfortable each day and even wiggles her nub now. I\u2019ve yet to hear her bark, she\u2019s just a quiet little gal. Her temperament has been amazing, especially considering she was in a mill for 7 long years. \nBeatrice gets along with both of my dogs and other foster extremely well. She tries to play with the other dogs but we are still careful because of her stitches. Once they come out next week she will be free to play away. She is also SO good about wearing her cone overnight or when we can\u2019t watch her. She actually leans towards me so I can easily put it on! I\u2019ve never had a dog so accepting of wearing a cone. Beatrice isn\u2019t much for toys yet but hopefully will figure that out. She does like to explore the yard and check things out. She is also completely housebroke, she had 1 accident within her first few minutes here and that is it. Again, I\u2019m amazed after 7 years in a cage she\u2019s SO good. She does have her moments when she gets scared and goes to her safe place (crate) but those times are getting fewer and fewer. Beatrice would really dog great in most homes. She is so happy with any bit of love and attention she gets and is a joy to have around. \n\n1/9/21 Beatrice the Beabull has arrived yesterday after a long few days. Beatrice was a release from a puppy mill. After spending several days at our vet clinic where she was brought up to date and had a lump/cyst removed from her face she then jumped on a transport to WNY just in time for the Buffalo Bills playoff game! Beatrice is 7 years old and must have been spay due to complications with her last litter. Since she can\u2019t produce puppies anymore she got her lucky break and came to rescue. Beatrice is a super sweet girl. She\u2019s a bit shy but not as bad as most mill dogs. I have no doubts she will come around quickly. She really likes exploring the yard which is great since she needs to shed some weight. Unfortunately living in a cage with no exercise has caused her to be overweight. I got her some weight management food today so hopefully she will feel full while shedding some pounds. I think now that she has her freedom the weight will come off slowly and surely. Beatrice will have her sutures removed in about 10 days then will be ready for her own special family! More updates coming soon.",

He would do well in a couple scenarios. A home with older kids who know how to respect a dog but who also will love on him and give him attention or a home with a couple or single person who will give him attention and where he can bond with his \"person\" and share adventures with them- walks together, playtime in the yard, and snuggles on the couch.

She is a darling (but very shy) fawn and white pittie girl. She lived on the streets her whole life until we took her in. She takes a while to warm up to people but is never aggressive even when she is around new people- just shy. She is about 50 pounds. You can tell she is a darling girl who wants to trust... she just needs reassurance. She does best with positive reinforcement and would excel in a home where she is with another shy or submissive playmate similar in size and of the opposite sex. She does like to shred her blankets in her crate so setting her up with a thicker rubber mat to sleep on is ideal for her. She loves treats and she will find them if you aren't the best at hiding them or you forget them somewhere where she can reach them. Jayne was rescued with her puppies back in 2013.",

He came into the rescue needing FHO surgery so he will be going the process very soon followed by up to 6 weeks of rehabilitation before he begins his heartworm treatment. Nicknamed the \"King of the toys\" he likes to collect all the toys in the house and make his own little pile to lay in. Loves food and great on the leash. Crate & house trained, including dog door. We have not tested with cats or kids yet, but we can if an approved adopter requests it after his surgery.\n\n**Atlas is heartworm positive and will be starting the treatment process shortly after his upcoming FHO surgery. We allow pre-adoption of our heartworm positive dogs while they complete their treatment & crate rest at their foster home 30 days after the heartworm injections**\n\nInterested in adding Atlas to your family?

Comes up willing now for pets and is starting to engage in play with the other dogs in his foster home. Walks like a dream on a leash and would benefit from a home with routine to help keep building his confidence. Another playmate is required and we would prefer one that is fairly confident Simon can lean on and help him continue to flourish in his forever home. Sweet girl that is shy at first, but can quickly warm up with a patient and calm family. Still learning leash manners but does take direction well, and with more time and confidence building she will be a great companion! We have not been cat tested yet. Crate & house trained.\n\nInterested in adding Simon to your family?

            "description": "Hi, I am Lulu! I was deemed Agile Lulu because you will not see me miss out on any physical challenge just because I'm a tripod. I can run faster and I have better balance than my four legged friends at my foster home! \nlink to video: https://youtu.be/FEul6a-Yhzc\n\nI am a 2 year old, 64 pound Belgian Malinois Shepherd girl in search for my forever home. I am also a tripod - I lost a rear leg prior to coming into rescue, but that doesn't slow me down one bit. In fact, I am still the fastest and most agile dog in my foster home! This is no lie. When I fly past you at the park, you'll see!\nI walk on leash, am very well crate- and house-trained, love to go for car rides (I can easily jump into the highest of vehicles) and I am very social with other dogs! I am an easy part of the pack. I play well with other dogs with my toys, but I always seem to get my favorite toy first and hang on to it all day. I am very food and treat motivated, so you can use these to help train me for specific things! But, since I am so food motivated, it is better to give me a quiet space to eat my food, such as in my crate, so I dont get scared that I am going to lose my meal to others. I get too excited around cats or pigs, so I am best in a home only with other large playful dogs I have been with many large dogs in my foster home and get along very well with all of them! I even back down if they get too pushy with me. My favorite thing in the world is to play fetch. In fact, if you watch my adoption video, you will see just how agile and fast I am and how much I love fetch. I love to carry my Kong toy with me everywhere - even to the vet clinic! I pretty much live to play. If you are considering me, you should research my breed a bit - we are high-energy dogs that are very motivated to play, and we need to play every day. So, if you are an active person who wants to take me on runs and hikes, and play fetch with me daily, we could be the perfect match! I do need exercise and I would love to have a yard. Even though I love to run and play, if you sit down on the grass, I am going to come sit next to you and give you a kiss and cuddle to you a bit before I run off for more fun. Please do watch my adoption video and contact my adoption coordinator if you think we might be right for each other! I look forward to a lifetime of fun and adventure with you!\nThis sweet, sassy, one of a kind tripod Belgian Malinois is already spayed, up to date on vaccines, deworming and ready for a new home. Missing one leg does not slow her down and anyone would be so lucky to bring her home. \nThe reason we are looking for a home with no small children or small animals is because LuLu has high drive, and when she goes for her toys it can sometimes be rough in a moment of excitement. We do not want anyone or anything to be hurt by accident while she is diving excitedly for her Kong. She can get overly excited and can be pushy and need direction. Not an abnormal behavior for many breeds, just needs direction. She needs a dog savvy adopter who will embrace her activity level and bring her along for adventures!\n\nplease email alayna@threelittlepittiesrescue.org with any questions!\n\nLulu is fully vetted and in excellent condition according to the veterinarian!\n\nlink to application here: https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/19753/generic",

            "description": "The puppies in Amber's litter were born on 12/24/2020 when Amber was safely at Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue after being on the euthanasia list at a Tulsa shelter. These puppies can't be adopted until they are 8 weeks old, which will be 2/18/2021. We will add more information as each puppy's personality develops. \n\nBefore applying to adopt a Pit Bull or Pit Bull mix, you need to be familiar with your local breed-specific legislation regarding Pit Bulls. Applicants must live within 50 miles of the Omaha/Council Bluffs area.\n\nSince this puppy may be too young to be altered at the time of adoption, the adopters will be provided with a voucher to have the puppy altered and microchipped by the time he is 6 months of age. This must be done at Nebraska Humane Society. If you prefer to take the puppy to your own vet, we will pay a PORTION of the cost ($69) to your vet of choice.\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for this puppy is $450. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

These puppies can't be adopted until they are 8 weeks old, which will be 2/18/2021. We will add more information as each puppy's personality develops. \n\nBefore applying to adopt a Pit Bull or Pit Bull mix, you need to be familiar with your local breed-specific legislation regarding Pit Bulls. Applicants must live within 50 miles of the Omaha/Council Bluffs area.\n\nSince this puppy may be too young to be altered at the time of adoption, the adopters will be provided with a voucher to have the puppy altered and microchipped by the time he is 6 months of age. This must be done at Nebraska Humane Society. If you prefer to take the puppy to your own vet, we will pay a PORTION of the cost ($69) to your vet of choice.\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for this puppy is $450. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

            "description": "The puppies in Amber's litter were born on 12/24/2020 when Amber was safely at Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue after being on the euthanasia list at a Tulsa shelter. These puppies can't be adopted until they are 8 weeks old, which will be 2/18/2021. We will add more information as each puppy's personality develops. \n\nBefore applying to adopt a Pit Bull or Pit Bull mix, you need to be familiar with your local breed-specific legislation regarding Pit Bulls. Applicants must live within 50 miles of the Omaha/Council Bluffs area.\n\nSince this puppy may be too young to be altered at the time of adoption, the adopters will be provided with a voucher to have the puppy altered and microchipped by the time he is 6 months of age. This must be done at Nebraska Humane Society. If you prefer to take the puppy to your own vet, we will pay a PORTION of the cost ($69) to your vet of choice.\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for this puppy is $450. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

            "description": "The puppies in Amber's litter were born on 12/24/2020 when Amber was safely at Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue after being on the euthanasia list at a Tulsa shelter. These puppies can't be adopted until they are 8 weeks old, which will be 2/18/2021. We will add more information as each puppy's personality develops. \n\nBefore applying to adopt a Pit Bull or Pit Bull mix, you need to be familiar with your local breed-specific legislation regarding Pit Bulls. Applicants must live within 50 miles of the Omaha/Council Bluffs area.\n\nSince this puppy may be too young to be altered at the time of adoption, the adopters will be provided with a voucher to have the puppy altered and microchipped by the time he is 6 months of age. This must be done at Nebraska Humane Society. If you prefer to take the puppy to your own vet, we will pay a PORTION of the cost ($69) to your vet of choice.\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for this puppy is $450. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

            "description": "Gizmo is a  sweet 6 year old female Chi/ JackRussel Mix. If you are looking for a total lap dog Gizzy is your girl! She does takes some time so warm up, but once she does she is your faithful friend. Her new owner would need to give her the time and space to warm up, typically about two days. If you are looking for a little companion she is your girl! She gets along fine with other dogs but we feel she would prefer to be an only so she doesn\u2019t need to share all the love.and your lap. She loves to be in your lap or close by on the couch.  She is well house trained to go outisde, but is also use to having a pee pad avaible. She is use to a fenced in back yard and we would love her new home to also have a fenced in yard. Her previous owner said that she is not a huge fan of leashed walks,(Due to the cold weather we have not had her out on a leash.)  She has been vetted and is UTD on her vaccines and spayed. She had a dental and is ready for her new home. If interested in Gizmo please submit an application at www.yorkiesinc.com",

Allie loves people and has never meet a stranger.  She has not been around young children, and due to her size and strong desire to be a lap dog, she would do best in a home with older kids.  Allie enjoys car rides and loads up like a champ.  She loves to play fetch, but instead of bring her toys back to you, she will proudly prance around while carrying them in her mouth.  In true lab fashion, Allie will even take her favorite ball to bed with her at night.  Allie is crate trained  and is well behaved and quiet in the house.  She has never been destructive while home alone or while waiting in the vehicle.  Allie seems to enjoy the company cats and has been around cows and horses without issue.  Allie has gotten along with medium/large male dogs in the past, but she can be picky about her female friends.  Allie would do best in a home with an experienced dog owner or as an only dog.  What this 66-pound lap dog wants most is to have her very own human to love!",

            "description": "Hi. My name is Daisy and I am a 2 year old Australian Shepherd mix.  I am an owner surrender and don\u2019t quite understand what is going on. \n\nI love to play outside in the snow. I know how to sit. I love people. I have lots of love to give. I seem to be house-trained. I am very protective. I don\u2019t let anything in my yard. I would do best as an only pet . I do not get along with other dogs. I live with 2 cats but we are not friends. I bark at them, but not excessively. When I hear new noises, I will let you know. I have a kennel, but don\u2019t use it when my humans are gone.  I don\u2019t enjoy car rides. I drool a lot.  \n\nI weigh 65 pounds, but it is all tail.  \n\nDo I sound like a good fit for you? If so, send a text and set up a meet. \n\nAdoption Fee: $350 (no checks) \n\nDog Coordinator:  Jaime 651-324-1105 or Jaime3369@gmail.com\n\nDue to the recommendations about the coronavirus, we are not able to have group adoption events at PetSmart.  We are, however, allowed to do individual adoptions so if you are interested in this pup/dog, please contact the foster listed above to set up a meeting.  We look forward to continuing to save dogs with you and will resume group adoptions as soon as we can.  Thank you for your patience and understanding.\n\nOur fosters do the best they can to provide all information about the animal's background and temperament while in foster care in their home.  An adopters routine and home environment is likely going to be different than that in their foster home.  Sometimes there is more that comes out about a dog's personality once they have been able to settle in a home & truly become comfortable.  There are great articles out there written about the different stages a pet goes through after adoption; discussing transitions that happen at 3 days, 3 weeks, & 3 months.  We highly recommend reading about this - it will help you understand the transition your new pet goes through.   \n\nLast Hope, Inc. is an all volunteer, foster based, no kill rescue! You can see almost all of our dogs on Saturdays from 11am - 3pm at Lakeville PetSmart (located by Hy-Vee just off 160th & Pilot Knob) & Burnsville Petsmart (located just off Hwy 35E & County Rd 42 by Chianti Grill).\n\nPolicies: You do not have to have a fence to adopt a dog from us, but some dogs will require a fence or acres to play, or an active family who will make sure the dog gets the exercise it needs to be happy.  Some dogs do not have the temperament that will do well with young children.   \n\nThe Adoption Fee is not enough to cover the vet bills. Sales tax of almost 7.25% is also included in the adoption fee that you see. Please consider donating to Last Hope to help us save these animals!\n\nCAN YOU FOSTER? By taking a dog or puppies temporarily into your home and then coming to our adoption days to help find them homes, we can save more! If you\u2019re interested, please email our dog coordinator: jaime3369@gmail.com and give us your contact information and what you would like to foster and someone will get back to you! You can also apply to be a foster home on our webpage! In the upper left hand corner there\u2019s a drop down tab with the link for canine foster home. Just fill it out online & submit! We will get back to you as quick as we can.",

His former owner, Mr. E has loved Fritz all of his life, but sadly, he has recently had to move into an Alzheimer's facility and Fritz is unable to go with him.\n\nOne of our dearest supporters heard about their situation and stepped in to temporarily care for Fritz while we find him a longer term foster or adopter.\n\nFritz is partly blind, but not totally. He is a little shy but extremely food motivated.\n\nA home with older, calmer dogs where he can relax peacefully in their company or where he can be the only pet would be ideal. He is a senior pooch after all and deserves a relaxing retirement!\n\n?\n\nIf you have space in your heart and home for Fritz, please reach out to us asap and we would be more than happy to answer any questions you have! stephanie@wagshopeandhealing.org",

They could no longer care for her and surrendered her to us. Taffy is such a happy, friendly and sweet girl. Her tail is always wagging and she never met a stranger she didn't like!\n\nThe reason Taffy is listed as special needs is because she was diagnosed with a condition called megaesophagus. This is characterized by a lack of motility in her esophagus meaning the food does not move into the stomach, but rather sits in the esophagus and causes regurgitation. In addition to medication a solution is to have Taffy eat several small meals and to remain upright for 20 minutes after feeding. There is a chair made especially for this called a Bailey Chair. This allows gravity to assist in moving the food into her stomach. Many dogs adjust well to this condition and can lead happy normal lives. \n\nIf you are interested in meeting Taffy please complete the adoption application at www.greatpets.org. If you have any questions please email us at info@greatpets.org.",

A foster said yes to me, probably because of my amazing eyes, and she took me home and is giving me all of the loves! \n\nDon't be afraid of me because I look kinda funny. My previous owners didn't give me any flea medicine, and it turns out that I am pretty darn allergic to the little buggers and it made me lose all of my fur! I think it's growing in quite nicely though now that I have good food and good vet care!\n\nI am friendly with other dogs and very sweet with people. I am a fun, super loving girl who really wants a home that loves me like I love them. If you think I'm the girl for you, just fill out an application to meet me at www.pawsitivetailskc.org.

In her former home, Oreo was a bit of a couch potato, catching z's (that means naps) on the couch, under the bed and wherever her heart desired. She doesn't have as many options in terms of where to sleep here at PACC, so we know she'd love to get back into a home and find some new spots to snooze. In play group, Oreo was a bit nervous but came into the yard with a waggy tail and greeted other dogs appropriately. Her interactions were a bit stiff at first, but she eventually warmed up and engaged in some gentle and dainty play with the other dogs. Oreos is a friendly girl who also likes to cuddle up with staffers and volunteers, soliciting treats and affection. Oreo would do best in a home free from kids, or with kids who are old enough to understand that dogs can need space sometimes. She would also thrive under a dog savvy owner who understands herding breeds and their behavior. If Oreo sounds like the girl for you, make an appointment to meet this big lovebug today.",

            "description": "In Greek mythology, Athena was the goddess of wisdom. Well, this Athena is only 2 years old, but we're told she's wise beyond her years. Athena came to PACC after her owner was no longer able to afford her medication. Even though she's a young girl, she's got some a bad hip and has been on medication to help with the pain. She's in need of an operation to repair it and would love to spend her recovery inside of a home instead of at the shelter. In her former home, Athena lived with another dog and a 5 year old child and did well (we're told she loves kids, but isn't as fond of cats.) She's housetrained and was a bit of a couch potato, due to her hip. In play group, Athena was a bit nervous at first, but was tolerant of other dogs and engaged in a little bit of gentle and dainty play. Staffers say she's people-oriented and preferred to stay by her handler. She's a shy girl, but very sweet and friendly with humans and dogs alike. Athena is easy to leash up and walks well, not reacting to other dogs in the kennel or along the way. Athena is a total doll and will make someone a very lucky owner. If Athena sounds like the dog for you, make an appointment to meet her today.",

All of her babies got rescued safely and Amara had to be trapped. AGBR had a pre-arranged foster but unfortunately that fell through. Amara is looking for a forever home that will understand she can be a little shy at first but she warms up quickly and absolutely loves her humans. She is smaller girl weighing only about 20 pounds and is as sweet as she can be. Amara would make the perfect pet for a calm household so she would probably do best with older children. If you are interested in adding Amara to your family, submit your application today.\n\nAmazing Grace Bully Rescue is a foster based rescue in the Pensacola, Florida area. We do not have a physical building. If you would like to meet any of our pups, the first step is to fill out our online application so we can contact you.\n\nOur adoption fee for Amara is $200 and includes her spay, current shots, rabies vaccine, and a registered microchip.\n\nIf you would like to adopt this Amazing dog, please fill out our online adoption application at www.amazinggracebullyrescue.org\n\nIf you have any questions, please text your question to\n723-2037\n. You may also send a message to our Amazing Grace Bully Rescue Page on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or send an email directly to amazinggracebullyrescue@gmail.com\n\nDisclaimer: We are located in the Pensacola, Florida area and will consider local applicants first, especially with puppies since we use a vet in the local area.",

She is goofy and loves to fun around and play with her toys, but when she is done playing, she is quite laid back and relaxed.  She enjoys attention and loves to be around people.  \n\nThe NAWS Dog Adoption Program operates as a rescue versus a shelter.  We believe in matching the right dog with the appropriate family based on each specific dog or family's needs.  To achieve this, we believe in spending the appropriate amount of time with each family to allow for enough interaction time with potential adopters.  This cannot be achieved if people stop by unexpectedly to meet our dogs.  Please e-mail Stacy at stacy@nawsus.org to setup a day or time to meet with one of our adoption counselors and our potential adoptees.  Thank you!\n",

I've been told I'm a little goofy - just because I jumped into an upended dog house and couldn't figure out how to get back out. They even took a picture of me while I was in there. Jeez, give a guy a break! I've been living outdoors, so I'm probably not \"house trained\" (whatever that means), but I'm pretty smart so I think I could pick it right up, if you give me a chance. All I really want is a good home where someone will love and spend time with me. Could that be you? I'm available now, so email Save the Strays if you want more information.

She came to us in need of some TLC and it has been a long road for this beautiful girl to start feeling better.  She would love to find a home where she can continue on the road to getting healthy and can be cherished and cared for  Faye is a very easy-going girl who considers feeding time her favorite part of the day!  She likes other dogs but prefers smaller ones such as herself.  Faye would love to be a couch potato and snuggle up with her special people.  She is a super sweet girl who will surely steal your heart!\n\nThe NAWS Dog Adoption Program operates as a rescue versus a shelter.  We believe in matching the right dog with the appropriate family based on each specific dog or family's needs.  To achieve this, we believe in spending the appropriate amount of time with each family to allow for enough interaction time with potential adopters.  This cannot be achieved if people stop by unexpectedly to meet our dogs.  Please e-mail Stacy at stacy@nawsus.org to setup a day or time to meet with one of our adoption counselors and our potential adoptees.  Thank you!\n",

            "description": "After the Mona Lisa, Da Vinci would surely have painted Donatella as she sounds like a super model, has the looks and class of one and will surely be the talk of the town as well. Donatella is a gorgeous young Walker Hound who has stunning markings in the standard tri color pattern inherent to her breed. She is about a year old and is small for a hound, weighing only about 35 lbs though she wouldn't turn down an extra treat or two if offered to become a bit curvier. Donatella is a confident gal around other dogs but clearly has not had a lot of positive interactions with humans so is a bit shy, though warming up more and more every day. This gal would love a home with another dog, or 5, doesn't matter to her as she is well versed in dog language and camaraderie. She would likely prefer a home with somewhat older children who are less startling with the noises they make and good snuggling buddies all the while. She would love a fenced in yrad to be a hound, sniffing here and sniffing there and will soon settle inot a wonderful routine with your family that gives her confidence and security, things she has likely never had before. Donatella is a true beauty with a gentle soul and is waiting to become the star painting in your family.\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time.

Gunner knows to go potty outside and will go to the door to let you know it's time to go out.

This male chocolate lab is high-spirited and friendly, and we estimate that he's approximately 5-6 years old. He is treat motivated, loves a ball, and wants to please.\nNevada was a stray picked up by a central Florida animal control.\nNevada weighs 74 lbs., is heartworm negative and we've brought him up to date on vaccines. He's already neutered and microchipped.\nHe would fit into a home that offers lots of love and exercise. Sweet Nevada is glad 2020 is behind him and hopes this new year brings him good luck in finding a forever family.",

Ryder is a sweet and gentle boy that has a little anxiety in our busy rescue setting.  When he is away from our rescue, he shows his sweet personality.  He loves to give kisses and chew on his toys.  Ryder is potty-trained and great with other dogs.\n\nThe NAWS Dog Adoption Program operates as a rescue versus a shelter.  We believe in matching the right dog with the appropriate family based on each specific dog or family's needs.  To achieve this, we believe in spending the appropriate amount of time with each family to allow for enough interaction time with potential adopters.  This cannot be achieved if people stop by unexpectedly to meet our dogs.  Please e-mail Stacy at stacy@nawsus.org to setup a day or time to meet with one of our adoption counselors and our potential adoptees.  Thank you!\n",

Hockey's owner knew he was at the shelter and never came for him. He is heartworm positive so we will be working on bringing him back to health this new year.\n\nHe's hooman and dog friendly and has been on his best behavior while waiting for us to save him. Hockey is starting to come out of his shell and open up. He's a pretty mild mannered guy for a young Husky and likes to play with the other dogs in his foster home. He's submissive in nature and really just a big sweetheart.\n\nHockey is potty trained and communicative when he needs something. He'd like a forever home with a fenced yard and another canine to play with. He's not been small kid tested but would be fine with older children. You do not need breed experience to adopt Hockey but please educate yourself on our website: www.huskyrescueteam.org/education\n\nWe will be using the slow kill method to treat Hockey's heartworms and will provide an Adopter all medication until he's negative. So he can be adopted now. His adoption area is NJ to NC.\n\nwww.huskyrescueteam.org\n~~Husky Education And Rescue Team is a foster based rescue. Our dogs are in our foster homes all up and down the east coast. We do not have a facility in which you can visit. We find this a huge benefit because we learn our dogs and are able to educate our adopters on what it's like to have them live in your home. Part of our process, once pre-approved, is to speak with the foster for the dog you're interested in. If you're still interested in adopting from our rescue the first step is to complete our adoption application online at www.huskyrescueteam.org/apply\n\nIf you have additional questions please email info@huskyrescueteam.org",

            "description": "Yukon, called \u201cYuki\u201d, is a 10-week-old female pup, a Border Collie mix.\n\nYuki was a surprise.  Here is the background story --\nAli and Uni, two of the three pups from the \u201cRoadside Litter\u201d were rescued on 12/28/20. \u201cWhy Roadside?\u201d, you ask. Pups were spotted some weeks ago, crossing the street while following their Mama, here on the Navajo Nation.  It took some detective work but finally we found that Mama and Papa were raising pups just off the road, living in a \u201chole\u201d. While the goal of this rescue was to rescue the whole family, Mama and Papa started leaving pups alone longer and longer and pups were at risk of getting run over, and when we went to get them all, only two pups were there, Uni and Ali, no Yuki.  Two weeks later, Yuki was found nearby, in the back of a school, near an empty barn.  Given her markings and size, she is undoubtedly a littermate of Ali and Uni.  \n\nYuki has been in foster care, along with her litter-mates for nearly a week.  At first, Yuki was aggressive and striving to be the alpha in the pack, likely due to fear, since she was on her own for more than 2 weeks.  Luckily, it did not take long for her to learn how to be a pup again and get along.  Her bigger sister, Ali, appears to be the pack\u2019s alpha and Yuki is making progress daily.  She is already spending 100% of her time with her sisters, unsupervised, including overnight, in their kennel. They play and play. (Yuki got the \u201cbest bather\u201d award. Some of the pictures posted are of her \u201cafter bath\u201d.)\n\nYuki is fast! She is playful and as a Border Collie type dog, she is smart, active, and is likely to be large, probably 60-70 pounds.  She currently 10 weeks old, 15 pounds feels safe inside and in the backyard. \n\nLike any pup, Yuki loves to chew on things, is playful, is learning potty-training and is about to start leash-walking this week.  She has already started wanting pets from her foster Mama and is doing good at snuggling, for a beginner. It helps that her litter-mates show her how!\n\nUPDATE:\nVet appointment coming up. Yuki took to leash walking like a champ.  She is still a pup, very \"mouthy\" but we are working through this stage.\n\nFoster Mama Tiasha requests that you fill out the online application at blackhathumanesociety.org AND email her at tveselames@gmail.com and tell a bit about you, what you are looking for in a dog, your daily activity level, experience with smart/active/larger breeds,\u2026 \n\nAt Blackhat, we strive to match the needs of the dog with the needs of the adopter.",

Newton is a young boy around 54 lbs of deliciousness inside and out. In addition to his amazing good looks, he is a guy that loves his friends and volunteers. Newton is an active boy on the farm, eager to explore his surroundings and get in a friendly tussle with his group mates. Are you looking for an exercise partner that is ready on a whim and will go as long as you do? He's your guy. Newton is an all-around gentle, loving guy who will be great with other dogs, kids, or whatever. Mainly, he just needs a place to call home. Send in your application today to come over to meet Newton.\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

If a dog/puppy is still listed on Petfinder- we are still accepting applications for them***\n\nHi there! Let's get the medical notes out of the way first and see if you still think Fiona would be a good fit :)\n\nFiona was in a foster-to-adopt home recently & they took her to see a vet and we discovered that she has a heart murmur. We do not know the severity at this time, but will be getting xrays to determine if she will require medication or not. Many dogs live long, healthy lives with heart murmurs and you would never know! We will pay for the xrays and are working on getting her into a vet at this time for a further work up.\n\nFiona, 1 years old, Female pitbull. Fiona is the sweetest puppy you\u2019ll ever meet! She is one of those girls that makes the perfect best friend. She is a little shy at first and does take a little while to warm up, but once she does, she'll be your best friend! This means that she will require someone who will be PATIENT with her and allow her the time she needs to decompress. She loves car rides and is very obedient. You only have to show her once and she\u2019s got it.   She is definitely a people person with a very loyal temperament. She would rather be with you than out playing with the others. She has a very calm, easygoing energy level. If you sit down she wants to lay at your feet (or sit in your lap!). She is house trained and has no problem being put in her kennel. Fiona is cutest when she\u2019s burying herself in her blankets. She is very calm and quiet. It\u2019s very easy to forget she\u2019s there. She is dog friendly, but again, she requires SLOW introductions when meeting any new doggie friends. After being in her foster home for only a week, she showed some signs of being possessive over toys with other dogs, but was easily corrected and allowed for the toy to be taken away from her by her person. She has been cat tolerant but likes to chase them. Decompression is KEY for sweet Fiona. \n\nDue to Fiona's puppy energy we recommend a home with no kids under the age of 12. \n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess on age, breed and size when fully grown. We rarely know a dog's exact age nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time.\n\nThe first step in our process is filling out an application. We will review your application as soon as we are able- there are two of us and we do the best that we can. We review applications on a first come first serve basis and look for the best fit/match for dog and applicant.\n\nhttps://heartoftheunderdog.org/adoption-application",

Prior to coming to us, she had a very difficult. life. She lived on the streets of Houston for more than a year (judging by how badly she was matted). She was extremely nervous when she came to her foster home. The other dogs would try to play with her but Figgy thought they were attacking her and she ran. She did not trust dogs or humans. \n\nIt didn't take long for Figgy to adjust to family life. Now she enjoys it immensely! She loves to run and play with her foster siblings. She's still trying to figure out how to interact with humans. She sometimes bites playfully. She rubs herself all over her human, marking them maybe? She has some odd quirks but they make her unique!\n\nFiggy has some mineral deposits on her spine. She has been treated with medication and crate rest. As of today, Figgy is doing great! She runs and jumps around pain free. Our vet has cautioned us that Figgy could possibly have future back issues and could require surgery. There's no way to tell if that will happen or when. If you are interested in Figgy, please be prepared for the expense of treating back issues up to and including surgery by a specialist.\n\n**We have very limited transport options. If you are chosen to adopt Figgy, please be prepared to travel to Houston, TX to pick her up. If we can assist with transport, we will let you know.\n\nFor information on our adoption process including adoption fees, please read our Adoption Information page at http://chinesecrestedrescue.org/adoption-info/\n\nIf you're interested in Figgy, email info@chinesecrestedrescue.org or complete an application online, http://chinesecrestedrescue.org/application-adopt-volunteer/",

            "description": "Meet Sam! Sam is Terrier mix, about a year old, and weighs 12 pounds. He is looking for a loving and patient home. Sam truly enjoys daily walks and is great on the leash. He does get a little excited when he sees other dogs, but totally manageable with a \"keep on moving along\". Sam is always up for a good game of fetch and soccer with his toys. He also loves napping in his crate and frolicking outdoors in the sunshine. Sam loves to cuddle and is a straight up sucker for belly rubs. There are also a few things that are important to know about Sam. We don't know if Sam had a bad experience and/or if it's just in his nature to be a bit anxious. Here's the deal with Sam. It takes a minute to get to know him and build trust. He isn't the dog you will meet and greet with and fall head over heels in love with. Sam needs; kindness, love, patience, space, time and most of all, respect of his need for all of these things in order to give him the time to learn and love you...truly let you in to see and experience the sunshine in his heart. He needs that person or people that WANT to invest in a dog that takes a little extra effort and patience. Sam is anxious around new things, especially loud and hearty energy. We don't recommend children in the home because of this, so if you are planning on having human babies down the road, Sam isn't the one. Sam likes to chill in his crate for a daily nap...and if there are new people coming over, he doesn't mind being in his safe place until he gets comfy and used to new people. He will probably always need to be woken up by sound vs. touch, as he has reacted by nipping when startled awake. Sam also doesn't like to be cornered, just something we have learned about and continue to respect. Sam is a very sweet and loving boy, once he is comfortable and trusts you. He is on the shy side, so meeting new people and friends isn't vibe. He's cool with his small circle of peeps. Sam truly enjoys playing outside, so a home with a yard would be ideal for him. We think Sam would enjoy being the only animal in the home, so that is a requirement. We know Sam isn't perfect, but he will be someone's perfect fit. If you have a soft spot for pooches that need and deserve a little extra effort, and know that with time and patience, the reward will far outweigh the effort...he could be your special someone.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit the I.C.A.R.E. Dog Rescue website and complete an adoption application: www.icaredogrescue.org/ready-to-adopt\n\nAdoption fee includes: spay/neuter shots up to date micro-chip fecal and vet check\n\nClick here to watch a video of Sam.",

We do not know much about where she came from or her backstory, however Honey did live in a foster home in Iran prior to arrival (foster home had kids and dogs). \n\nHoney is gentle, shy, nervous, timid and sweet \u2014 she has zero aggression but will need a patient home committed to continued confidence and trust building + desensitization and positive exposure.\n\nShe may do best with another calm dog friend and a big yard. She is learning to walk well on leash but can still get nervous about somethings and halt/pancake to the ground. She is still learning that stairs are not scary and her foster home is the second floor apartment so she has to be carried, but we are hoping she can master the stairs in no time.\n\nModerate energy \u2014 she is still decompressing and so we have not seen her full personality yet. She has wonderful potential with the right home.\n\nMay do well in a home w/ cats given slow intros. Recommend home teens plus.\n\n$300 adoption donation helps cover costs of travel and vetting \u2014 spayed, vaccinated, microchipped, heartworm/fecal tested and up to date on monthly preventatives.\n\nWe are unsure her true breeds  \u2014 she is about 45 lbs. Age guess best 2-3 years.\n\n*******************************************************************************************\n\nAdoption Process:\n\nStep 1. Complete online adoption application including pictures of home / yard\n\nStep 2. If it sounds like a good fit for all we will respond in 1-5 days to schedule a follow up call with an adoption counselor. Due to a high amount of interest for puppies, we may not be able to respond to all applicants but will try our best!\n\nStep 3. If it sounds like a match, we will promptly set up a meet and greet at the foster home\u2019s backyard or outdoor public setting practicing social distancing policies. Please review info on meet and greets at heartsforpawsrescue.com/meet-greet-info\n\nMore info & FAQS can be found at:\n\nheartsforpawsrescue.com/adoption-info\n\nWe can keep adoption applications on file for up to 6 months that can be used for other HFP adoptable dogs.",

Shakespeare is a nine year old hairless male and Ellie\u2019s dad. Ellie is a six year old powder puff female and has been with him her entire life.\n\nThey are spayed and neutered, up-to-date on vaccinations, heartworm negative and on preventative. They both behave well in their kennels although they have free run of the house except for longer periods. They are housebroken if let out regularly or kenneled for longer periods. Shakespeare has also made use of a belly band on occasion just to be safe. This is a good idea during cold and wet weather.\n\nThey love their separate beds to lounge in and love toys! They share toys and do not fight over them although they have their favorites.\n\nBoth are very nervous and timid when meeting new people. I found that slices of hot dog are the key to becoming their new best friend! \n\n**We have very limited transport options. If you are chosen to adopt this bonded pair, please be prepared to travel to Killeen, TX to pick them up. If we can assist in transport, we will let you know.\n\nFor information on our adoption process including adoption fees, please read our Adoption Information page at http://chinesecrestedrescue.org/adoption-info/\n\nIf you're interested in Shakespeare and Ellie, email info@chinesecrestedrescue.org or complete an application online, http://chinesecrestedrescue.org/application-adopt-volunteer/",

She can be rough and sometimes doesn't know when its no longer time for play, so she is looking for a active owner willing to give her lots of exercise and stimulation. \n\nIf interested in adopting Koi, please submit an online adoption application!

I am 100 percent TRUE to my breed. I have a bay that can win baying contests with. I cannot live in an apartment as a result. I am a companion animal and want to be with my person as much as I can. Therefore, I need a home with someone who is home A LOT. I was adopted as a puppy, but as I grew up I started to have some tussells with the other dog and the baby was born with a very rare skin disorder. I absolutely cannot hurt it even by accident. I was loved and my family was devastated to give me up. I am missing an ear because my mother bit it off when I was a puppy and went for the food. So, I have a real unique look to me, don't you think? I probably need a home with a fenced in yard and no other pets to be completely successful. I do love older kids and I am completely housebroken and devoted to my people. Please call Jill at 910-620-3783 to meet me.",

            "description": "Say hello to Frankie! Frankie is a young pittie-mix who is doing extremely well in his foster home. He's a giant wiggle butt, and loves to give kisses and really wants to be a lap dog! He prefers to be right near his human! Because he is so enthusiastically friendly, we recommend no small children, as he could knock them over. Likewise, he's good with other dogs, but is a very energetic player! He has met a few cats respectfully but did want to play with them, and did back off when the cat said no. So, there is potential for him to live with cats.\n\nFrankie is fully housetrained and crate trained (sleeps in crate with no issues), and he's a quiet dog who only barks when someone is at the door or he hears the neighbors dog barking. He's not destructive, but loves to tear up a good squeaky toy :)  He isn't a beggar, and isn't food motivated, really only praise motivated, which has made it easy for his foster mom to train him to sit, stay, come, etc. \n\nThrough some trial and error, Frankie's foster mom has determined the best way to get this guy to comfortably walk on a leash without going after his leash, is to have him in a rear latching harness with a \"gentle leader\" which still allows him to drink and bark, but keeps him from biting his leash.\n\nInterested?

She does well on a leash but does need a little bit more training so she doesn't pull as much.  She would make a great running partner though! Nova still has some insecurities that she is working on and will need an experienced family to continue to get her through those. Many new situations make her nervous including new people. She would do best in a home with no female dogs and older children only. She is looking for a home where her family will have lots of time to spend with her.  She does well with male dogs and loves to play with them. Once she is comfortable with you she is all in and loves you and yours dearly! She enjoys lounging on the couch and getting lots of belly rubs. She is an amazing girl once she gets to know you.  \n\nWe are requiring a fenced-in backyard where she can run and play.  NO EXCEPTIONS.",

I seem to do well with female dogs and I love people. I seem to have a little too much interest in cats so I can't live with one. My biggest love of ALL is food and I am a sucker for treats. You can get me to do what you want if you bribe me with a treat. I was homeless at a rural animal shelter for a few months before coming into rescue. Several owners ago, my owner used a pipe to teach me the rules and you can see the scars on my head. I don't hold a grudge towards people at all and live every day to its fullest. I thrive in a predictable environment and I am routine oriented. I need a fenced in yard to run around in since I am strong and pull on a leash. It would be great if you had previous dog experience because I would love to be adopted into a forever home that will keep me \"forever\" for once. I am tired of being passed around.

Lily is a playful girl, and would love a home with another dog. Lily is very shy when she meets new people, and she prefers women over men. Lily will need time to adjust to her new family, and patience is a must. She will come out of her shell, and when she does, you will see her bouncy, sweet, silly, playful side. She just needs time.\n\nLily is house trained and crate trained. She loves her toys and pet bed. She is truly a great girl!\n\nLily is appx. 23-25 pounds.\n\nIdeal home for Lily is a home with another dog, and a primarily female household.\n\nA home with a fenced yard is required, no apartments/condo's with dog park.\n\nTo meet Lily, please contact us for a meet and greet. Applications to adopt can be found on our website at www.animalleagueofwashingtoncounty.org",

Although truth be known, I prefer the raw (don\u2019t judge).  Sometimes there is gravy on it too or goat\u2019s milk, so good.  \n\n5.\tWhat kind of personality do you have?\n\nI\u2019m an affectionate guy that loves to learn, play and explore.  Whenever I see my foster family, I can\u2019t help but wiggle all over.  However, sometimes being around other dogs tends to bring out not so good qualities, so prefer not to share my people.  \n\n6.\tDescribe your perfect day\n\nMy perfect day is hanging out with my foster mom and learning all the important things I need to know to be a good big dog.  Learning is literally my favorite thing to do (next to eating, can\u2019t forget that).  Then a good cuddle and a relaxing nap.   \n\n7.\tWhat is your favorite toy?\n\nMy favorite toys are my stuffed rhino and blue chuck it ball.  I also love a good marrow bone, those things are tasty.  I don\u2019t like to share, momma says you think I grew up as an only child, but no, I just don\u2019t like to share.  Sorry not sorry.\n\n8.\tDo you know any tricks?\n\t\nI don\u2019t know any tricks per se, but I\u2019m learning lots of good things each day.  \n\n9.\tWhat scares you?\n\nI\u2019m not really afraid of many things.  I\u2019m very curious and like to explore, however those big cars still make me pretty nervous and sometimes sick (momma says I\u2019m doing good though and I will get over this hurdle).\n\n10.\tDo you like cats?\n\nI\u2019m not sure, never met one.\n\n11.\tDo you have any doggie best friends?\n\t\nI currently live with three older females but my time with them is very managed.  As I said earlier, I prefer not to share with other dogs.  \n\n12.\tIf you could be anywhere in the world, where would it be?\n\nNext to momma learning.\n\n13.\tHow is your health?\n\nAccording to my veterinarian, I am a healthy, growing puppy.  \n\n14.\tHow long have you lived in your foster home?\n\nI\u2019ve been with a member of Even Chance since I was a tiny fella.   \n\n15.\tWho do you live with in your foster home and who is your closest companion? \n\t\nI share a beautiful home with my foster parents and foster siblings. I have two high school aged people siblings that I adore and can\u2019t wait to see every single day (seeing them makes my whole body wiggle with joy).  I also have three dog siblings.  All of my foster family is great, but I\u2019m probably closest to my foster mom.  \n\n16.\tWhere do you hang out when you are home alone?\n\nI always hang out in my crate when there aren\u2019t any people home.  \n\n17.\tWhere do you sleep?\n\t\nI always sleep in my crate at night, but while my family is home, I will lay on my dog bed in the family room or snuggle on the couch.  \n\n18.\tWhat do you love about your foster family?\n\nI love that my foster family is so dedicated to meeting all my needs. I am grateful that Even Chance rescued me! \n\n19.\tWhat was life like before you were rescued by Even Chance and brought into the welcoming arms of your foster parents?\n\nI was stuck in a basement with my siblings running amuck and not getting the proper nutrition and other critical things I needed.  My future was bleak and I was headed for a terrible life of dog fighting.\n\nEven Chance does not operate on a first come, first serve basis. In most cases we have already decided the type of home and owner we want for our dogs. These opinions are based on the temperament tests we perform prior to accepting the dog into our program and the behaviors the dogs display as they spend time in our homes. Our agency reserves the right to deny acceptance of any dog to an owner who we feel the lifestyle does not match that of the dog. We are in no way judging you or your lifestyle; we simply want to put our dogs in the best living situation possible. We take very seriously the decision we make when it comes to placing one of our dogs in a forever home. If I sound like the perfect pit bull for your and your family and you are interested in giving me a forever home, do not hesitate! Please fill out an application here and my foster family will contact you to schedule an in-person meet and greet. We look forward to meeting any and all interested applicants. \n\n",

He's a real fun boy who loves to play fetch and likes to chew on bones. He's also a veteran counter-surfer. Boomer does well with other dogs as long as they are willing to play all day long.

Particularly squeaky ones!  Annie is so sweet but can be a little nervous upon meeting new people.  She warms up as soon as she gets to know and trust them. Annie is current on her vaccinations, spayed, house trained and working to learn more obedience and leash skills.   An ideal home for her would be one with a fenced in yard and a family who is willing to play ball with her and take her for walks.  Because she is playful and energetic, Annie would do best with older children. She would also prefer to be your one-and-only pet companion.

We followed the post hoping that someone would've been able to capture this little girl but after several days of trying no one was able to get her. We went out on Friday 1/15/21 and unfortunately we had no sighting of her but we went out again on Saturday 1/16/21 and attempted again today and through the help of some neighbors we pinpointed where she was hanging out. As we were talking on the side of the road to several neighbors we spotted her lying at the edge of the woods. We asked the neighbors to go back to their homes so that we could set a trap. We set the trap with some steaming hot fried chicken and drove a distance away and within probably 10 minutes we had her. We named her Idgie after a character in the movie \"Fried Green Tomatoes\" because the nearby town of Mooringsport reminded us of the town in that movie. Special thanks to all the neighbors who tried to help this little girl. What an amazing group of people. Little Idgy is fed, given a capstar to get rid of the fleas and ticks, started deworming and we were able to get off quite a bit of her matting with the exception of her front paws that were very sensitive. She is rested and warm with a full belly and a nice soft bed. She'll be heading to the vet the week of 1/18/21 to take care of all of her vetting. Welcome little Idgie! Because a lot has happened to her and she is still a flight risk, we are going to make sure we settle her in completely before placing her for adoption.\n\nNOT TAKING APPLICATIONS: We are not taking applications yet. We will post when s(he) is ready for adoption. In the interest of fairness, EARLY application submissions will NOT be considered. Please note we cannot respond to messages/emails, etc., on dogs that are NOT yet available for adoption. Please wait until the dog is available for adoption. We appreciate your cooperation and understanding.",

I do think she would be best in a home either by herself or that could provide her with more one on one attention. She is more comfortable with men and while she has zero history of aggression, she does take a little longer to warm up to women. She is generally quiet, but needs to be with an owner that doesn't mind working with her on socialization.

This lively girl hasn't had much training, but is smart and eager to learn. She gets along with other dogs but has a lot of herding drive and can be nippy.\n\nShe needs a canine companion that enjoys rough play and can tolerate herding behavior. Zara loves to play chase and tug of war. With her speed, strength, and stamina, she would be excellent at agility, nose works, barn hunts, and obedience training.\n\nZara needs a home experienced with herding dogs and a big fenced yard is required. She needs a family that will provide positive training to keep her smart mind engaged and lots of activity and exercise for this high energy youngster.\n\nIf you would like to make Zara a member of your family, please submit our on-line application at:\n\nhttps://www.almosthomehdr.org/apply",

They are siblings but do not need to be adopted together. They play well with each other and other dogs in foster care. At night they sleep in a crate. As just puppies, they will look to their humans for guidance, routines, and exercise that slowly helps to develop their bodies and mind.\n\nCATS: both Unity and Peace interacted well with cats.\n\nHOUSE TRAINING: They are trying real hard like a two year old child to remember where the poopy goes, and with patience and continued training, they will be successful!\n\nPlayful, well balanced in that they are not overly timid or assertive---just right there in the middle regarding temperament and behavior.\n\n\n*.  *.   *.  *.  *.   *.  *.  *.   *.  *.  *.   *.  *.  *.   *.  *.  *.   *.  *.  *.   *.  *.  *.   *.  *.  *.   *.  *.  *.   *.  \n\nWe do not complete DNA tests on our rescued pups.

Sometimes we are not spot on. And, remember too that even if you know the supposed dominant breed in your new puppy or adult dog, it does not mean that those particular genes will dominate your dog's personality. :)\n\nAPPLICATIONS ARE ONLINE @ karmicrescue.org",

Sometimes we are not spot on. And, remember too that even if you know the supposed dominant breed in your new puppy or adult dog, it does not mean that those particular genes will dominate your dog's personality. :)\n\nAPPLICATIONS ARE ONLINE @ karmicrescue.org",

He's a sweet boy- just needs someone to understand that huskies have spunk and require patience and lots of activity. Has some bad manners we are working on but over all a good boy. He is a typical high energy husky!\n\nKai has bloomed in his loving foster homes! When he came to LPR, he was very timid, didn't understand how to play, and wasn't really confident. Today, he is so playful, cuddly, loves to give kisses, has confidence and a spunky personality (per typical for a husky).\n\nHe is crate trained and house broken. He will need a home with a fenced in yard (6' privacy) and with husky experience.\n\nHis adoption fee is $250\n\nWe require a home visit and vet reference.",

We have gotten her lots of care and her skin looks so much better!  She is ready to make her way to Buffalo!  Willow needs to be in a quieter home.  She needs a fenced yard. She does okay with other dogs - but needs a quieter dog who is not going to be in her face a lot.  She is very sweet with people.  The vet who was caring for her said he wanted to take her home but his beagle doesn't like other dogs!  If you live in the Buffalo, NY area and would like to foster or adopt Willow, please go to hamburgmutts.org and fill out our application!",

He worked on his basic commands and his impulse control.  Although he still wants all the human attention he can possibly get, he has learned that barreling through anything or anyone to get it is not polite.  Duke spent 9 years on a chain, but holds no grudges. All he wants is to please his people.  Housebreaking is going well and Duke is being more respectful of the elderly dog in his foster home. He has also been working on off-leash activities which is going very well. We have said all along that Duke was a diamond in the \"ruff\" and he is really starting to shine! www.greenbayanimalrescue.weebly.com",

He is frightened of noises such as a dryer, car horn, garbage disposal, people talking outside the door, the shower curtain closing, etc. \n\nHe was wonderful with his owner, and is now loving and friendly with his foster mom, but he is still frightened of everyone else. He did try to nip at the vet tech initially but did eventually allow them to work with him and he warmed up a little. He just does not trust people. He does bark at people and other dogs when out walking.\n\nToby would do well with an young retiree or a family with no children where one member of the family is home a lot. He will need love and patience to teach him how to trust. He would not do well in an apartment due to all the noise and his barking at all the noise.\n\nHe is up to date on vaccines, HW negative and neutered.  For an application go to www.homesfurhounds.com. He is located in Williamsburg, Va.  \n\n",

It takes him a little while to get comfortable in a new place, but when he does he turns on that husky charm (and attitude).\n\nHe requires an adopter with husky experience (no exceptions) and a very secure fenced yard (6ft privacy fence).\n\nHis adoption fee is $250\n\nWe require a home visit and vet reference.",

He is a sweet, playful boy with lots of energy so his forever home definitely needs a fenced yard!  Emmett would do well with another small, younger, friendly dog who likes to play.  He is  a little bit \"in your face\" with his foster siblings - always wanting to play - so he needs a cheerful, tolerant buddy or his foster momma thinks he would be okay as the only dog, too.  Emmett will do well with an owner who will offer him structure and routine and lots of exercise.  He would do well with someone who is home a lot.  Emmett loves to be outdoors playing, running and chasing his ball.   He also loves to hug his people. He loves to snuggle on the couch with his person. He is a young boy, between 1 and 2 years old.   If you live within 50 miles of  the Buffalo, NY area and would like to make this sweet boy a member of your family, please go to hamburgmutts.org and fill out our application!",

Please email the completed application to newleashrescue2018@gmail.com\n\nLydia is a 70lb Pointer mix who was abandoned by her family when they moved out of their house.     They literally took all of their possessions and furniture and left Lydia there, alone in an empty house.     Because of this, we don't have any prior home history.  Our vet is estimating Lydia to be around 2 years old.  \n\nLydia is a sweet girl who loves attention and loves to sleep with you.  She gets along good with other dogs.   She is currently living with dogs from 20 pounds to 70 pounds and has done well.    Lydia is housetrained too.   She doesn't bark much, but will let you know if she sees or hears something outside, and if someone is at the door.  \n\nLydia is very strong on a leash, and will not be a dog that most children can handle on leash until she has some additional training to reduce her pulling.   For this reason, Lydia is recommended for a fenced in yard, so she can run and get some of her energy out without having to be on leash.  She currently has a 6 foot privacy fence in her foster home.  She is able to jump a small 3 foot fence, so it is unknown whether she would be able to jump a 4 foot fence.  Five foot or six foot fencing is preferred.  \n\nLydia can go into a kennel but she will bark and would prefer a home where eventually she could have free roam.  She can be a bit mouthy or jumpy if people try to play rough with her and get her riled up.  She can be sensitive around her neck and does not like being grabbed by her collar - this has improved over the time that she has been in her foster home.  The best recommendation would be a home with older children who can respect Lydia's space. \n\nAdoption fee is $350.00 + tax (no checks)\n\nFoster to contact: Katie -  605-695-5126 (text preferred) or krkallemeyn@hotmail.com\n\nThis dog will be at our adoption event at the Woodbury PetSmart on Saturday from 11-2 looking for a home!\n\n\nOur fosters do the best they can to provide all information about the animal's background and temperament while in foster care in their home. An adopters routine and home environment is likely going to be different than that in their foster home. \n\nSometimes there is more that comes out about a dog's personality once they have been able to settle in a home and truly become comfortable. There are great articles out there written about the different stages a pet goes through after adoption, discussing transitions that happen at 3 days, 3 weeks, and 3 months. We highly recommend reading about this - it will help you understand the transition your new pet goes through.",

We thank you for your understanding. The adoption application link is posted below and the adoption process is outlined on the website.  Animatch asks that you read the Adoptee\u2019s bio in its entirety before applying to ensure you meet the requirements for the dog.\n\nGlacier is a gentle and sweet free spirit.  On the day that she was to travel to Animatch with her 7 puppies, she broke out of her travel crate and escaped.  Four days later she arrived at the Animatch Centre (after another unsuccessful escape) to join her pups.  Glacier is not accustomed to being confined (whether it be a crate or a room) and becomes stressed when she is.  In fact, she demolished part of a wall and molding around the door her first night at the Centre.  It is difficult for our Northern dogs to be free to roam one day and be restricted the next.  Despite her desire to be free, Glacier absolutely adores human companionship.  In fact, if she is outdoors alone her goal is to jump the fence; if she outdoors with a human, Glacier is right by your side asking for kisses and belly rubs.  Animatch expects that whoever adopts Glacier will be totally committed to providing her with a lifestyle that meets her needs \u2013 human presence a good part of the day, a property that is safe and secure, a love of the outdoors (especially in winter).  There is the possibility that Glacier may need medication to help with her anxiety \u2013 time will tell.  Her visit to our Vet revealed an old fracture to her hind leg.  As a result, her leg a little crooked and although she may not ever be a candidate to participate in the Iditarod, she will certainly enjoy many long walks and adventures with her human.  No doubt that Glacier will make her human the center of her universe; her life will revolve around their love, training, patience, and consistency.  If you have the experience and the desire to help Glacier through this uncertain time, you will never find a more loyal friend.  Fill in the Adoption Form and ask for Glacier.\n\t\nBreed:  Nordic mix\t\nSize:\t  Large (50 lbs)\t\nAge:\t  1,5 years\t\nGender:\tFemale\nEnergy:\tMedium-High\nGrooming:\tLow\t\nDog friendly:\tYes\nCat friendly:\tNo\nChildren:\t8 and over\n\nTO APPLY FOR ADOPTION OF THIS DOG, PLEASE VISIT OUR WEB SITE: www.animatch.ca AND FILL THE APPLICATION ON LINE.\n*** calls and e-mails will not be answered  ***\n\n",

A gentle giant if you wish, because I truly am gentle. I'm fully housetrained and know how to use a doggy door, but I can't control my bladder elimination anymore, so I dribble. I'm not super fond of wearing a diaper, but if it means I get to be close to my people, I will wear one! At my foster home I lay on a washable pee pad, or on a towel to catch my dribbles. I'm a pretty laid back lady these days, so it's easier to keep me in one spot than it would be a younger, more active dog. Im pretty indifferent about cats, so I could live with them, but I wouldn't have to. I also like other dogs, specifically large dogs like me. I live with some other dogs here, but I haven't been around any children yet. I really do love my adult people the most and just want to be around them. \n\nI'm not too incredibly active these days. Car rides and belly rubs are some of my favorite activities. I also really enjoy the water and going swimming, but let's be real, do you know a labrador who doesn't like swimming? I'm well behaved and don't jump up on people or furniture. I'm pretty fond of relaxing in the sun outside when it's nice out. I'm a perfect girl in my crate, and don't mind being in there when you have to leave, and I'm even more perfect when you come home and I get to be by you! I'm hoping my new human will love me for who I am and be by my side every step of the way, and in return I will show them all of my devotion.\n\nAlbert's Dog Lounge is a transporting dog rescue, meaning that we rescue many of our dogs from high kill shelters in areas of dog overpopulation. We are a specialty rescue focusing primarily on senior and special needs dogs.  The vast majority of our dogs come from the Houston, TX area where we have an entire team of volunteers, coordinators, and fosters. We do also work with local shelters, rescues, and owners.  If you apply for a dog that is currently in our local Houston program, we will work to get your dog transported to WI as quickly as possible. We ask that you have patience during this time of uncertainty and unprecedented dog adoptions nationwide. \n\nLearn more about Albert's Dog Lounge, our mission, and adoption policies by visiting Albertsdoglounge.org. \n\nOur process includes an approved application, reference checks, a homevisit, and then a meet and greet with the dog. Adoption fee is $275.\n\nBegin your application process by copying this link into your web browser: https://www.albertsdoglounge.org/apply\n\nWI Dept. Of Agriculture License Number: 474085-DS",

The right home will have kids over 8 and a fenced yard.\n\nAll dogs are fully vetted, up to date with shots, heartworm negative and spay or neutered.\n\nTo apply to adopt Lottie, email start2nj@yahoo.com",

He is deaf and will require a special home - one with a fenced in yard and experience with dogs who are deaf. He is currently in a foster home and not at the shelter. He cuddles and gives lots of kisses. He is hard to take pictures of so we will have more videos. If you would be interested in this little guy, please fill out an application today!\n\nThe Animal Rescue Project (www.animalrescueproject.org) is committed to the best possible veterinary care for the pets it rescues and it is looking for adopters who will be similarly committed.\n\nAll dogs and puppies are given a general check-up when they enter our program. They receive medication to remove any intestinal parasites (worms), fleas, and ticks they may have. Dogs greater than six months of age are checked for heartworm. If heartworm positive, the Animal Rescue Project treats the disease. Dogs and pups receive all age-appropriate vaccinations for distemper, and dogs greater than four months of age are also vaccinated for rabies, in compliance with State of Michigan laws. All dogs are also microchipped.\n\nMost dogs and older puppies are spayed or neutered before adoption. In the case of puppies not old enough to be safely sterilized, a $50 deposit is required at the time of adoption and is refunded to the adopter with proof of sterilization.\n\nThe Animal Rescue Project requires every adopter to establish an active relationship with a veterinarian no later than 10 days after adoption. Adopters will receive a plan for routine veterinary care at the time of adoption and are expected to work with their vet to complete the plan.",

In order to meet and adopt them, you will need to fill out an application for the foster mom to contact you!\n\nThe Animal Rescue Project (www.animalrescueproject.org) is committed to the best possible veterinary care for the pets it rescues and it is looking for adopters who will be similarly committed.\n\nAll dogs and puppies are given a general check-up when they enter our program. They receive medication to remove any intestinal parasites (worms), fleas, and ticks they may have. Dogs greater than six months of age are checked for heartworm. If heartworm positive, the Animal Rescue Project treats the disease. Dogs and pups receive all age-appropriate vaccinations for distemper, and dogs greater than four months of age are also vaccinated for rabies, in compliance with State of Michigan laws. All dogs are also microchipped.\n\nMost dogs and older puppies are spayed or neutered before adoption. In the case of puppies not old enough to be safely sterilized, a $50 deposit is required at the time of adoption and is refunded to the adopter with proof of sterilization.\n\nThe Animal Rescue Project requires every adopter to establish an active relationship with a veterinarian no later than 10 days after adoption. Adopters will receive a plan for routine veterinary care at the time of adoption and are expected to work with their vet to complete the plan.",

When he\u2019s not busy being the life of the party he can be found curled up on the closest lap. Could he be your perfect match? \n\nInterested in meeting Norbert? \n\nAll Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue dogs are in homes with foster families; we do not have a shelter where dogs are available for daily viewing.\n\nOur process is as follows:\n1.  Review our policies and adoption radius  on our website: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n2.  Submit an application for review and approval;\n3.  MPM Rescue reviews application and checks vet records and references;\n4.  MPM foster contacts approved applicant(s) to arrange a home check and meeting with available dog(s);\n5.   If there is a good fit, adoption is completed with a contract and fees (payable via check or cash).\n\nThe adoption fee is listed here: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n\nDogs from Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue come with the following medical care already provided:\n- Spay/Neuter surgery\n- Age appropriate vaccinations\n- Heartworm test (for dogs over 6mo) and treatment if positive\n- Microchip\n- Deworming\n- Heartworm and Flea/Tick Preventative\n- Any other necessary medical treatment as recommended by veterinarian\n\n*Please note that the identified breed(s) are best guesses.

In order to meet and adopt them, you will need to fill out an application for the foster mom to contact you!\n\nThe Animal Rescue Project (www.animalrescueproject.org) is committed to the best possible veterinary care for the pets it rescues and it is looking for adopters who will be similarly committed.\n\nAll dogs and puppies are given a general check-up when they enter our program. They receive medication to remove any intestinal parasites (worms), fleas, and ticks they may have. Dogs greater than six months of age are checked for heartworm. If heartworm positive, the Animal Rescue Project treats the disease. Dogs and pups receive all age-appropriate vaccinations for distemper, and dogs greater than four months of age are also vaccinated for rabies, in compliance with State of Michigan laws. All dogs are also microchipped.\n\nMost dogs and older puppies are spayed or neutered before adoption. In the case of puppies not old enough to be safely sterilized, a $50 deposit is required at the time of adoption and is refunded to the adopter with proof of sterilization.\n\nThe Animal Rescue Project requires every adopter to establish an active relationship with a veterinarian no later than 10 days after adoption. Adopters will receive a plan for routine veterinary care at the time of adoption and are expected to work with their vet to complete the plan.",

            "description": "Meet George Michael! \n\nHere are some great things his foster mom has to say about Georgie:\n\u201cI had a 10 year span of experience in the canine industry as a dog groomer and vet tech and this dog is hands-down the smartest dog I have gotten to know. I have never met a dog so enthusiastic about pleasing his people; he loves to work and he would love to have a job. He is so smart, eager and fast that I could easily see him as an agility, flyball, nosework, tracking or rally obedience star. This dog is up for anything you want to do! \nHe is fearful of strangers and takes a while to warm up to people. It does take him a while to fully trust somebody but once he does, he is so much fun to be around. He is quicker to warm up to women rather than men. A dog savvy and experienced home without cats or small children would suit him the best. \nHe loves to play ball and flirt pole. He is also good at amusing himself if you are busy and will toss the ball around by himself. He will also avidly watch tv if there are animals on it. He very much thrives on routine and if he has a set schedule he will stick to it without complaint. He is not destructive (except for tennis balls) and will never have an accident in the house for any reason. \nHe is a gorgeous dog and people comment on him wherever we go. Most people like to tell me that he looks like a dingo. He is a very interesting-looking dog and he is so adorable that he makes my heart melt. Everyone that lays eyes on him becomes enamored. \nHe isn\u2019t a lap-dog but wants to always be near his people. He can be goofy and cuddly but he also likes to do his own thing.\u201d \n\nGeorgie would love a home with someone who worked from home and was able to spend a lot of time with him. He\u2019s made many improvements thanks to the help of his amazing foster mom, and our trainer, so that he can be the very best boy for his new forever family. His ideal forever home will work on Georgie\u2019s success with continued work with either our trainer, or a trainer nearby to their home. He would love being able to do agility and work/have a job as he is happiest when he is able to have a job. \n\nTo adopt George Michael Aka Georgie, visit our website for an adoption application!\nThegratefuldogrescue.org",

Best with children over 10!\nDogs: Meet and Greet required\nHousebroken: Puppy - will need training\nAdoption fee: $495.00\n\nAlfie is a little shy when you first meet him and he's learning that being picked up is okay. With a little patience and a lot of love, this little guy comes around really fast! He will do best in a home with children ages 10 and up and a fenced in yard due him being a tad fearful. If this cutie could be for you, please fill out an application today!\n\nThe Animal Rescue Project (www.animalrescueproject.org) is committed to the best possible veterinary care for the pets it rescues and it is looking for adopters who will be similarly committed.\n\nAll dogs and puppies are given a general check-up when they enter our program. They receive medication to remove any intestinal parasites (worms), fleas, and ticks they may have. Dogs greater than six months of age are checked for heartworm. If heartworm positive, the Animal Rescue Project treats the disease. Dogs and pups receive all age-appropriate vaccinations for distemper, and dogs greater than four months of age are also vaccinated for rabies, in compliance with State of Michigan laws. All dogs are also microchipped.\n\nMost dogs and older puppies are spayed or neutered before adoption. In the case of puppies not old enough to be safely sterilized, a $50 deposit is required at the time of adoption and is refunded to the adopter with proof of sterilization.\n\nThe Animal Rescue Project requires every adopter to establish an active relationship with a veterinarian no later than 10 days after adoption. Adopters will receive a plan for routine veterinary care at the time of adoption and are expected to work with their vet to complete the plan.",

He came into the shelter as a lost dog on Jan. 9 and his family has not come to find him. Bach is about 3 years old and weighs 48 pounds. He is neutered and up-to-date on vaccinations; he will be heartworm tested and microchipped upon adoption. Come meet him in Run 89 using ID#626793.\n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information. Shelter hours are: Tues. - Sun. 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. by appointment only until further notice, CLOSED Mondays & Holidays.",

She hopped right in and enjoyed looking out the window. It was a bit chilly out, but not too cold for a walk around the park. She didn't mind the leash and walked fairly well. Her back leg is a little weaker, but it didn't stop her from having a good time, and she could walk just fine. We were fortunate enough to even see some ducks. Blanca wasn't nervous, though they seemed to confuse her a little! I also found out that Blanca loves to be petted, and is very affectionate when you kneel down to her level! After the park, she was happy to jump back in the car and quickly curled up on the seat to relax. Overall, she is a very sweet girl and did not appear to be nervous with any people or animals that we saw from a distance. I enjoyed spending a day with Blanca very much!",

Ido well with other dogs.\n\nDoes Byron like other pets?\n\n I've learned to ignore cats andI love my canine fostersisters! Although, one of them thinks I play a littleroughsometimes.\n\nDoes Byron like children?\n\n When I'm excited, I like to jump upand put my butt on others! I might be a bit much for little children.I'd do best in a home with children 13 years and older.\n\nFavorite Toys:\n\nMy favorite toys include my bedding and rubber tire, but I enjoy any toys I can shred!\n\nIdeal Forever Home:\n\n Are you working from home? I'd love to keep you company.I'd love a patient and active family. I also would love to continue training! I'd do fine with other dogs and in a home with older children, 13 years and older.",

To complete an application, visit the shelter. See hours and location at https://www.manchesteranimalshelter.org. Be sure to tell them ARK sent you!\n\nMeet Gypsy and Tyson! They are a \u2018pittie wonderful\u2019 bonded pair who must be adopted together. Their hearts would simply shatter if they were separated. Both are under the care of our friends at the Manchester Animal Shelter in Manchester, NH. They are spay/neutered and up to date on vaccinations. \n\nTyson, the gentleman, who is a brown 5-year old, 75-pound male pittie mix. Tyson is a calm, gentle lover. He likes the quieter, finer things in life: a nice walk, a snuggle on the couch watching TV, a nice massage ;)...He can be quite silly, too, and is a blast to play with!\n\nThen there's Gypsy is the lady of the pair. She\u2019s a white, 12-year old, 65-pound female pittie mix. Gypsy is a spunky gal who is still full of life and energy! She's a go-getter! She loves life and everything it has to offer. She's very social and loves to know everything that's going on. :) She is the more independent one of the two.\n\nThese two cuties have been together since Tyson was born. They had two loving owners, but both of them sadly passed away late in 2020. Now they are on their own, waiting for a new home with humans to love and care for them. Rest assured, they want to love and take care of you, too.  \nComplete your family with these special fur kids! They would do best in a home with children 12+ years old. For an application, please email  canines@manchesteranimalshelter.org Be sure to tell them ARK sent you! #ARKforGypsyandTyson  #JustSaveThem\n\n\n~ THIS IS A COURTESY POST ~ PLZ DO NOT CONTACT MASSPAWS ~",

To complete an application, visit the shelter. See hours and location at https://www.manchesteranimalshelter.org. Be sure to tell them ARK sent you!\n\nMeet Gypsy and Tyson! They are a \u2018pittie wonderful\u2019 bonded pair who must be adopted together. Their hearts would simply shatter if they were separated. Both are under the care of our friends at the Manchester Animal Shelter in Manchester, NH. They are spay/neutered and up to date on vaccinations. \nGypsy is the lady of the pair. She\u2019s a white, 12-year old, 65-pound female pittie mix. Gypsy is a spunky gal who is still full of life and energy! She's a go-getter! She loves life and everything it has to offer. She's very social and loves to know everything that's going on. :) She is the more independent one of the two.\nThen there\u2019s Tyson, the gentleman, who is a brown 5-year old, 75-pound male pittie mix. Tyson is a calm, gentle lover. He likes the quieter, finer things in life: a nice walk, a snuggle on the couch watching TV, a nice massage ;)...He can be quite silly, too, and is a blast to play with!\n\nThese two cuties have been together since Tyson was born. They had two loving owners, but both of them sadly passed away late in 2020. Now they are on their own, waiting for a new home with humans to love and care for them. Rest assured, they want to love and take care of you, too.  \nComplete your family with these special fur kids! They would do best in a home with children 12+ years old. For an application, please email  canines@manchesteranimalshelter.org Be sure to tell them ARK sent you! #ARKforGypsyandTyson  #JustSaveThem\n\n~ THIS IS A COURTESY POST ~ PLZ DO NOT CONTACT MASSPAWS ~",

She is friendly with other large, submissive dogs, and would do well sharing her home with another confident dog. \nSophia has had a hard life. She came from a terrible home, was fearful, and had heartworm that we treated her for. She is all healthy now, and waiting for her forever family. Sophia can be nervous of new people, and is not a fan of kids unpredictable movements and behaviors. She would thrive in a quiet home with no children and little to no visitors. She would be the perfect companion for a retired couple looking for a sweet girl to give them warm and loving company. \n\nTo adopt Sophia, visit our website for an application\nThegratefuldogrescue.org",

            "description": "Rosie Posie is headed to the PNW and so excited to meet her furever hooman/s! This sweet girl has waited a very long time for this moment. She was found as a stray with an embedded collar and not in the best shape, but look at her now!! Her name is Rosie from her incredibly rosey, happy personality but also references the beautiful pink undertone she has. She is what we like to refer to as a pocket pittie-- the beautiful features of a pittie, in miniature! She is estimated at 1 yr old and weighs rougly under 40 lbs-- a perfect size pup to take with you everwhere you go.....and she would love that! She loves car rides, walks, meeting new people and other dogs. She can be a little timid around strangers and sometimes give out a low \"woof\" if she feels uncomfortable, but Rosie is such a great girl and her attention can very easily be redirected. Her fosters have been amazing at helping to care for her skin wounds and allow her time to heal both inside and out. She is fostered with another young female dog, who she gets along with so well....Rosie loves other dogs! She loves to go on walks and to run around doing zoomies. She enjoys bath time and absolutely loves peanut butter. She is not shy to catch a spot on the couch and will give you kisses galore, if allowed. This sweet girl is special and cannot wait to meet her very special hooman/s. \n\nTo bring Rosie Posie home, please apply here-\nhttps://petstablished.com/adoption_form/19764/generic or email cynthia@threelittlepittiesrescue.org if you have an application on file.\n\nThe adoption fee is $500 and includes all vaccines (DHPP & booster, Bordatella, Rabies), spay/neuter, microchip, multiple dewormings, flea preventative, heartworm treatment with 6 months of heartworm preventative for after adoption, a high quality nylon Martingale collar, a 30 day trial of pet insurance, transport from TX to the PNW, and many years of priceless memories.\n\n**APPLICATION REQUIRED FOR A RESPONSE**",

I am a 4 year old female Shepherd/Terrier Mix who my foster mom says I weigh about 30 pounds, have the softest fur, and the most expressive eyes you've ever seen.  I fit into my foster home with no trouble at all.  There are 3 other dogs here, and I get along with all of them.  There's a cat here too, and while I ignore her most of the time, it's hard to resist chasing her when she runs.  \n\nI did test positive for heartworm so will need to receive treatment - Cuz i Matter Animal Rescue will continue to pay for that even if you adopt me, but it is important for me, and for all dogs, to be on a heartworm preventative.\n\nI am housetrained, crate trained, walk well on a leash, and love to jump in the car and go for a ride.  I like squeaky toys a lot, too!  I don't bark very much -- not even when the other dogs here are howling at the FedEx truck or at the people talking on foster mom's Zoom meetings.  I'm pretty much perfect!  I like running around outside and sunbathing a little each day, but mostly I like hanging out with my people in the house.  Snuggle-time on the couch is the best!  I could be happy living in an apartment with some regular time outside, or I could be happy in a house with my own yard.  I am an easy-going, good, sweet girl.  I promise to come running from across the house to jump in your lap and give you kisses when I see you sit on the couch, and then you can pet my belly, okay?\n\nIf you'd like more information about me, please send CiMAR an email so they can send you all the information about adopting me.  You can also find more pictures of me on their website:  http://www.cuzimatter.org/adopt-a-dog\n",

He's 7 years old and needs to put on some weight so he will be around 12+ pounds. He needs an adult home, preferably as an only dog because he is learning not to be possessive of his toys. He is respectful of humans and his toys but he would NOT be good with children. He is doing well with respecting his foster dogs and his toys but this is something that would need a dedicated calm person the continue to help him with if you have another small dog. Xavier needs a home with a routine and people that will approach him slowly. He responds well to baby talk and lowering yourself to his level and not standing over him. Once he trusts he will not be hit by you he is kissy and loving! When you tell him he is a good boy he wags his fluffy tail with excitement! He will need basic grooming and monthly heartworm prevention as all dogs in Florida should be on because of mosquitos spreading Heartworm disease. Xavier also had a dental cleaning with his vetting. This dog's adoption fee is $350 to go towards their vetting (vaccines, spay/neuter, heartworm/Ehrlichia/Lyme test, fecal test, pre-op blood work, dental cleaning, and microchip as well as grooming if needed). If you are interested please fill out the adoption application For additional information regarding our adoption process, please check our FAQ's Page. \n\n *All dogs in the care of Get a Life Pet Rescue live in loving foster homes while waiting for their perfect match. They don't live in cages or crates (unless there is a medical reason to do so.) They are treated as family pets while in our care. * All dogs in our care are fed premium brand holistic food as well as supplements and vitamins specific to each dog's needs. We don't buy inexpensive bulk dry kibble, our rescues are fed premium wet food diets as part of a comprehensive rehabilitation program to ensure maximum health.*All of our rescues receive complete quality vetting including full dental cleaning with pre-op bloodwork, spay/neuter, vaccines, and grooming. Dogs in need of specialized medicine will be seen by specialists, such as full cardiac workups, ophthalmologist visits, all suspicious lumps, and bumps are biopsied, and every medical need is transparent to potential adopters. *Once you adopt from Get a Life Pet Rescue, you become part of our compassionate family and we are here for you if a problem with your precious dog arises.",

Please email the completed application to newleashrescue2018@gmail.com\n\n\n\n****Please read the entire bio before inquiring.   Google is not recommended to  diagnose heart conditions or possible concerns versus speaking to a licensed veterinarian****\n\nChinook is a 3-4 month old husky pup that came to us in December.  He was surrendered from a breeder due to him having concerns with his heart.     Chinook's heart murmur was confirmed, and then we had an echocardiagram done on him to look into it further.   Chinook has two somewhat leaky valves that are causing the murmur.  All of his other heart measurements were normal and no meds are currently needed & he currently has no restrictions.   He was cleared for anesthesia and is ready to look for a family to call his own.    Another echocardiagram is recommended for Chinook in 3-4 months to recheck his heart, and see if there are any changes with his growth. Doctors feel there is a small chance of continued improvement in his murmur as he grows and he should be able to have a long and healthy life.     \n\nChinook needs a family that understands that there may not be further issues down the road, but there also might be.  His adoptive family needs to be prepared to care for him in any way that he needs as he ages.    Please consult the vet that would be caring for Chinook if adopted if you have questions about what could be concerns. \n\nChinook is your typical husky pup.  He likes to try to take things from the adult dogs, and all he wants is to eat and play with toys and other dogs.  He can be a talker and is still working on his housetraining.  He is sleeping in a crate at night and when his foster is gone and he is doing well, but not 100% there yet.  Chinook does have some puppy pad training as well.   He is currently living with a 6 foot wood privacy fence.   He currently weighs around 30 lbs and will be 60lbs+ full grown. \n\nPreference given to applications with  6 foot fenced yards and prior husky breed experience.    Huskies are escape artists and not recommended with cats.  They are runners if they get off leash.  \n\nAdoption fee is $450.00 + tax (no checks)\n\nFoster to contact: Katie -  kit_n_caboodle22@hotmail.com\n\nThis dog will be at our adoption event at the Woodbury PetSmart on Saturday from 11-2 looking for a home! \n\nOur fosters do the best they can to provide all information about the animal's background and temperament while in foster care in their home. An adopters routine and home environment is likely going to be different than that in their foster home. \n\nSometimes there is more that comes out about a dog's personality once they have been able to settle in a home and truly become comfortable. There are great articles out there written about the different stages a pet goes through after adoption, discussing transitions that happen at 3 days, 3 weeks, and 3 months. We highly recommend reading about this - it will help you understand the transition your new pet goes through.",

He's an absolute sweetheart, running from person to person for pets, affection, and his all time favorite, belly rubs. \n\nRedd is not a fan of other dogs and likes to let them know how he feels by barking, which isn't always great on a walk. We are looking for a patient owner who will help him with these manners, and with some training tips he has improved in the past. He'll do much better in a loving home than he will in the shelter where he's surrounded by other pups, which is super stressful for him. \n\nRedd is a great boy who will always be there for pets and kisses, and he'll always be happy as long as you're around. \n\nRedd is looking for an adult only home where he's the only furball in the home. If you're interested in this cutie, you must click \"Apply for Adoption\" to submit an online application.\n\nIf you're viewing this animal on Petfinder, please visit the animal's page on Bideawee.org and click on the \"Apply for Adoption\" button to submit an adoption application!",

Unfortunately her previous owner became too sick to take care of her and two other Beagles, so the family asked BRSM for help. Maggie is a very sweet and easy going girl with a velvety soft coat. She enjoys the company of other dogs and shows no food aggression or other. She also does not mind that her foster brother wants to be no. 1 and keeps photo bombing her pictures or gives her sloppy kisses. She is just a real patient sweetheart who likes taking things slow, sniff around and get some pets and belly rubs, and of course like all Beagles, she likes a good meal. Maggie will probably also be happy to be the only dog in the house since she is not interested in playing at this point but she is still new so things may change.\n\nMaggie's Webpage - http://beaglemaryland.org/brsm_ms/vIndividualCurrentDog.aspx?dogid=69838\nAdoptable Dog Webpage - http://beaglemaryland.org/brsm_ms/vCurrentDogs.aspx\n\nIf you'd like to adopt one of our beagles:\n*Go to our Website - href=\"http://beaglemaryland.org\n*Review our  Standards for Adoption - http://beaglemaryland.org/Home.aspx?pg=standardsforadoption.htm\n*Fill out an Adopter Profile - \nhttp://brsmbeagles.org/new_site/documents/BRSM_profile_secure.pdf\n and email it to us (or print it off, fill it in and send it via regular mail, if you prefer)\n*A BRSM volunteer will contact you to guide you through the rest of the process!\n\nWe hope to hear from you, and so do the beagles!",

I gave birth to 4 beautiful puppies here on the ranch. I am a very sweet girl and can be a little clingy with the humans that I get attached to, but that just means that I love you! I'm pretty mellow and overall a great dog that would make an excellent pet for any owner. I would prefer to be the only dog in my future home, as I am typically not a fan of interacting with other dogs. I don't appear to respond to a high prey drive, but proceed with caution if you have a feline friend in your home. I would be happy living in any type of environment, as I am very adaptable and calm. I am very friendly when I meet new visitors and I think I would love to join you out and about in public if you'll take me. I am well-trained and appear to be potty-trained, as I never go to the bathroom inside. I love to go for long leashed walks, play with toys, and most of all, snuggle on the couch next to someone that I love!",

Originally thought to be around 5 years old(seems younger at heart) Shih Tzu mix(Foster Mom calls him a fancy foo foo breed)is looking for his special adopter.\n\nMany factors and time go into fostering a dog that needed to be brought back from the brink of death. He was abandoned, locked in a crate, thrown in a portapot left to starve to death, which he nearly did. His road to recovery started in Georgia with his first foster Mom, Kristin. The personality of a dog at first isn't the personality that emerges over time once they are rehabilitated from their medical conditions. After being in foster here in PA for months now , his current foster Mom Cindy has truly been learning the little one's real personality. He discovers new happiness everyday as we help him with manners.\n\nRusty is a loving and sweet pup. He is a not so innocent pup who sees things so innocently. He LOVES his people. So far all the people he has come in contact with he smiles and of course with a face like his...you can\u2019t help but smile back. He is feisty though, very feisty and energetic. Seems to be making up and moving on from his horrible past.\nHe likes to be by your side which also means he is under foot a bit. \nHe is just about housetrained BUT isn't 100% there yet. He can be very vocal and likes to join in conversation or start them up himself should he feel he\u2019s not getting your full attention. \n\nHe LOVES to play with dogs HOWEVER he is very in your face and needs to be compatible with the potential adopter's dog who is tolerant of that rambunctious behavior. \n\nHe was VERY curious with the resident cat HOWEVER that curiosity turned into an obsession to bite the cat's tail. The resident cat truly holds his own BUT this would now put Rusty in a potential forever home with NO cats.\n\nRusty is very mouthy but luckily his adorable underbite seems to prevents pain from being inflicted which is why a household consisting of children under 12 is not recommended. \n\nAdopter must live within less than a 50 mile radius of the rescue he is with. (Horsham PA area).\n\nSO , if you think you are the perfect home and meet with the above criteria for this little man please complete an application and his foster Mom will be happy to talk with prospected approved applicants.\n\n\nTo begin the adoption process please, fill out our online application. Go to wagsrescue.com and click on adoption form.\nPlease call Susan @ 267-312-3372 if you have any general questions.",

Although she doesn't need to be walked, Angel does love to go outside and roam around a bit for fun. She is pee-pad trained, so no need to take her outside in bad weather! Angel is apartment-friendly but would do best with a first floor apartment with a walkout, as she is tiny and a lot of stairs could be challenging for her.

            "description": "If you are interested in adopting this dog, please download and complete an Adoption Questionnaire from our website and email Dena at DenaE@k-9lifesavers.org\nYou can learn about the adoption process and find a Word, PDF and ONLINE version of the questionnaire by visiting: http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/howtoadopt/.\nDog's Name: Puddy\nEstimated Breed : Great Dane Mastiff Mix\nApproximate Age: 6 years\nApproximate Weight: approx. 100 lbs\nCurrently Living at: Boarding\nAdoption Fee: $300\nDOG'S DESCRIPTION\nPuddy is a sweet, gentle giant. He will need a home with plenty of room to stretch his long legs as well as a family without small children that can be accidentally knocked down. Puddy has lots of love to give and hopes to find his forever home in the country where he has lots of room to safely roam in a large fenced yard. He's great with other dogs, but it was reported to us not good with cats. We can't be sure if he is housetrained so expect some possible work in that area. While Puddy is dog friendly, he'd do best as only dog in the home. He loves to just lounge around and get all the love.\n\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\nSponsor Me! Make a tax-deductible donation today by visiting us at http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/donate/ . Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support!\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\nPlease \"like\" our Facebook Page for the most current events and new dogs.\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!",

I need a slower approach when meeting new people but once I warm up, I am all snuggles and kisses. My foster says I am very smart and I know how to sit! I am good in a kennel and doing well on potty training but I will need to continue to have a routine. I do go outside now but I am not good on a leash but I can learn! I have been great with the dogs in my foster home but I may be better in a home as the only dog. I would also prefer to be in a quieter home but with patience, I can be a great fit for your home.

I am a terrier mix but my foster mom tells me that I am one of the greatest breeds on earth, a Great American Mutt!  I am very proud of that. I am a small girl and weigh 28lbs but I will probably weigh less. \nI was found down south as a stray. I was waiting for my babies to arrive.  My rescue angels thought they had time so they told me: \"Daisy, we have plenty of time to get you up north to Chicago!\".  Well..... surprise!  I had my babies very shortly after arriving in IL.  \nMy babies are all healthy and well on their way so it is time for me to enjoy a little \"me\" time. \nI was a naughty girl. I am an escape artist and I ran away from my foster home and stayed away from 6 weeks until I came back. I am glad I am back because it was very cold out there and I was getting very hungry   My foster mom was very, very, very mad at me and scolded me. \n My foster mom says that I am a lovebug.  She calls me her velcro because once I get attached to her I won't leave!   There is also a 1 year young boy here and I just love being with him. I don't like to see him cry so I stay by his side. That seems to cam him down. \nMy foster mom tells me I am her best pillow because I love sleeping at the top of her bed!   \nI can wait to meet my forever family. I haven't had the best life but I am loving my new life. They tell me that I will be going to a place where I am loved and safe and will have plenty to eat. Can we meet? \nI promise I will be by your side for the rest of my life.  \nI can't wait to lay at the top of your bed, for me that's the best place in the whole wide world!\n\nTo meet Daisy please complete an adoption application at www.treasuredanimalrescueinc.org \nWe cannot adopt out of the state of IL \n\nWe might not be able to get back to you due to the large volume of applications. Please check our website for updates on the adoption status of your pet of choice.  Thank you for choosing to adopt.",

            "description": "The Taffy pups will bring a little sweetness into your life! These adorable fluff balls look to be little Australian Shepherd mixes with cute bob tails. We aren't sure who their dad is, what their exact mix is or how big they will get but Mama Taffy is around 40 lbs so we expect these pups to be medium to large when they are done growing. Chewy is looking for a family that understands the time, patience, and energy needed to raise a young pup. We require all puppy adopters to provide training that includes: house training, basic training, leash training, and socialization. Additionally, this cutie is going to need proper exercise, mental stimulation, and your attention and love to grow up to be the best companion. We do not allow our dogs or puppies to sleep or live outside; they must be incorporated into your family and be made a priority in your life. In return, you will have the most loving and loyal family member you could ask for. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting a puppy, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs. Thank you for rescuing.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue.

            "description": "The Taffy pups will bring a little sweetness into your life! These adorable fluff balls look to be little Australian Shepherd mixes with cute bob tails. We aren't sure who their dad is, what their exact mix is or how big they will get but Mama Taffy is around 40 lbs so we expect these pups to be medium to large when they are done growing. Candy is looking for a family that understands the time, patience, and energy needed to raise a young pup. We require all puppy adopters to provide training that includes: house training, basic training, leash training, and socialization. Additionally, this cutie is going to need proper exercise, mental stimulation, and your attention and love to grow up to be the best companion. We do not allow our dogs or puppies to sleep or live outside; they must be incorporated into your family and be made a priority in your life. In return, you will have the most loving and loyal family member you could ask for. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting a puppy, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs.

Taffy came to Labs and More with her three adorable fluffy puppies, but Taffy is ready to put motherhood behind her in favor of a forever home. Taffy is friendly with people and loves everyone, including kids! She can be a little mouthy at playtime so may not be the best fit for little kids. She's still fine tuning her leash skills but enjoys her daily walks and is always down for a game of tug of war. She is housetrained in her current foster home and sleeps in her crate through the night.

            "description": "Hello!! My name is Zeke, and I just arrived at Stray Haven! I came all the way from North Carolina. The caretakers here think that I'm a coooool guy. I have swag. I am only 4 years old and sometimes live in my own world. I've been around the block in my four years though. The first thing you might notice about me is that I only have one good eye. My other one was injured somehow and my body took care of it. But that doesn't slow me down! (Although, I'm known for walking into glass doors). I have a couple other lumps and bumps on me, but right now I seem to have a clean bill of health! I'm pretty good with other dogs as long as they are not in my face, I like to keep to myself. I'm a typical hound, who keeps my nose to the ground doing my own thing. But I'll come back to you for some pets every once in a while. I'm pretty much housetrained too, but hey sometimes accidents happen here in the kennel. I'm sure I'll do a lot better in a home. Once I am in a home, I could benefit from some crate training though. Sometimes when I'm alone in the yard I can get into trouble! I'm just a curious guy. If you are interested, stop into Stray Haven and meet the coolest guy on the block -- Zeke!\nStray Haven Humane Society & SPCA\n194 Shepard Rd., Waverly, NY 14892\n(607) 565-2859, www.strayhavenspca.org \nOpen hours (winter): Tues, Wed & Thurs Noon - 6pm; Sat 10am-4pm",

I am currently heartworm positive, but I am being treated by Almost Home's vet and am feeling much better!\n\nHere's what my foster mama has to say about me!\n\n\"\"Tank is a very sweet boy! He does very well with children of all ages. He doesn't do well with other dogs or cats. Tank is such a cuddle bug! He sleeps with my daughter every night and sleeps all through the night, he is a bed hog though. Tank is terrified of stairs, he won't even look down our staircase. He's just a very happy dude looking for his furever home!\"\"\n\nIf you are interesting in adopting me, please fill out an application! https://us01.sheltermanager.com/service?account=ah0334&method=online_form_html&formid=5To complete an adoption application, go to: http://almosthomeanimals.org/applications/adoption/",

I need a home where I am the only animal and where I am not around livestock. I am shy around strangers but do come around. I am housebroken and crate trained & it would be wise to put me in my crate when I will be left home alone. If you are willing to invest the time & get me obedience training, I know I can be the perfect dog! I do not climb, but I do dig out, so a yard with a fence that is very sturdy is a must. If you would like to be my forever family, please see a member of my kennel staff family so they can arrange a meet & greet for us. Love, Myles",

            "description": "Puptart is a sweet and gentle 3-year old gal. She is affectionate and friendly, she would love to meet you! This petite little lady came to FAMD as a lost dog. She can be bashful at first, but warms up quickly. She knows how to sit and she is so eager to learn more! Puptart hasn't discovered her favorite toy just yet- she hasn't found one that fits her fancy. Won't you consider adding sweet Puptart to your family? ~ All of our dogs and puppies go home spayed/neutered, microchipped, heartworm tested (if at least 7 months old), and up to date on age-appropriate vaccinations. ~ We do our best to update information on adoptable pets as frequently as we can. If you're interested in a specific pet, we recommend that you call the shelter and ask if he or she still is available. Adoption questionnaires are processed in the order in which they're received.\nFor current adoption fees, please see our website, www.dearbornanimals.org. Adoption fee includes: age-appropriate vaccinations, spay or neuter, microchip, ID tag, fecal / worming, basic physical and behavior assessment. Dogs (6 months and older) receive an occult heartworm test. For an additional $20, cats (12 weeks and older) can be tested for FIV (feline immunodeficiency virus) / FLV (feline leukemia).",

While my friends at HSNBA desperately want to help me, the shelter is too stressful an environment to undertake treatment and treatment itself is very expensive. The shelter has a few options to help with treatment, and if I steal your heart you should talk with them and your vet about what my treatment is like. For more information on heartworms, please visit the American Heartworm Society here https://www.heartwormsociety.org/pet-owner-resources/heartworm-basics\n\nI am currently in a foster home and not at HSNBA, if you are interested in meeting me, please contact the nice folks at HSNBA so they can put you in contact with my foster family to set up a meet & greet. E-mail HSNBA at adoption@hsnba.org, call us at: (830) 629-5287 or stop by and speak with the folks at HSNBA at 3353 Morningside Dr. to get your information sent over to my foster home. My foster family is the best and can give you more information on me.HSNBA lists all animals online from the moment of intake, and our listings are updated automatically every midnight. Some of these animals may not be available for adoption at this moment, but you can always call the shelter at 830-629-5287 for clarification on the adoption process or the animal's current status.",

            "description": "Sachi\n\nArriving in Denver 1/17/21\n\nChihuahua mix\n\n9 months old\n\nDoesn't love other dogs, does ok with those that mind their own business after a slow introduction \n\nNo idea on cats \n\nWould do great with kids who are old enough to understand she's a little unique and needs to be treated like the princess she is \n\nHouse trained\n\nCrate trained and she doesn't know much other than her name as far as commands go \n\nPrefers bottled water (don't even ask) \n\nWill need to stay on supplements \n\nMust stay a trim and healthy weight \n\nMAY need a cart in the very distant future\n\nLoves to wear clothes \n\nAll about cuddling and attention\n\nUp to date on everything besides needing to be spayed which will be done in early February \n\n10lbs approx\n\nSachi's story is lifetime movie devastating. She was abandoned with her mom by her owners right before Christmas. They said they were surrendering them because Sachi couldn't walk and the 2 dogs were bonded so they couldn't just surrender her. She was confused as was her mom and with her needing vet care, her future was looking grim. Once at the foster home we noticed a couple things, 1 Sachi could in fact walk and run & 2 her momma Aria was REALLY sick. When we got Sachi to the vet we were sad to find out that she was born without any hips. So when the owner said \"she's been like this for a while,\"@ I guess they meant her entire freaking life! What stinks is had they taken her to the vet early on she could have had 2 FHO surgeries to \"correct\" it. Unfortunately now the scar tissue is immense and her muscles have atrophied, so it's no longer an option. Our choices were to amputate both her rear legs, which seemed unnecessary being she uses them in her own way, or to leave her and understand she will need to stay on supplements and pain meds, must stay a healthy weight, and in the future may need a cart and pain management.\n\nWhile it's upsetting that we cannot correct her rear leg issues it has been amazing to watch her blossom in her foster home and truly become the charismatic little diva she deserves to be. Momma Aria's future wasn't to be as hopeful. We fought with Aria, (our vet bills prove it), but despite everything we did treatment wise the years of neglect took their toll. At approx 6:00 am on Jan 6th Aria took her last breath, asleep and cuddled with Sachi, it was peaceful but absolutely heartbreaking. While we are devastated at this loss we find comfort in knowing that Aria FINALLY knew her last baby was safe and loved, she was able to peacefully leave the epic mess that was her body in the most dignified way, as she deserved. \n\nThis sweet girl is only 9 months old and has experienced so much loss and neglect. She lost her human family, her home, her momma and now she is headed to us happier and hopefully. We are sure that her happy FURever after home and family are waiting for her arrival with great anticipation. \n\nIf you believe this fantastic family is in fact YOU please contact us ASAP!\n\nOriginal Post\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/100007204158922/posts/2779103145673130/?d=n\n\n $250.00 Adoption Fee \n\n(Which is considered a non refundable donation and being we are a 501c3 organization it is tax deductible.

I love to play fetch, throw me a ball and I'll go chase it (haven't quite mastered bringing it back yet).

We don't have a shelter so we will arrange a time for you to meet this cutie.

            "description": "If you are interested in adopting this dog, please download and complete an Adoption Questionnaire from our website and email US at\n\nmichelel@k-9lifesavers.org\n\nYou can learn about the adoption process and find a Word, PDF and ONLINE version of the questionnaire by visiting: http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/howtoadopt/.\n\nDog's Name: Pup Daryl\n\nEstimated Breed : Boxer Mix\n\nApproximate Age: 6 months\n\nApproximate Weight: approx. 39 lbs\n\nCurrently Living at: Boarding\n\nAdoption Fee: $375\n\nDOG'S DESCRIPTION\n\nPup Daryl is a sweet boxer mix hoping there is a family out there that will fall in love with him. He is very friendly, and still very much a puppy and will need room to run and play to get A LOT of exercise and training. Will you give Daryl a loving home?\n\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\n\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\n\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\n\nSponsor Me! Make a tax-deductible donation today by visiting us at http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/donate/ . Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support!\n\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\n\nPlease \"like\" our\nFacebook Page\nfor the most current events and new dogs.\n\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!",

            "description": "**Hello!Camel is currently living in a foster home. If youd like to schedule a time to meet her please contact Waysides Adoption Center at 816-986-4426. Thank you!**\nHi there, Im Camel! I love you. I already know this because Ive never met a single person that I didnt love. Thats my gift to you, and besides, I believe that life is so much sweeter when you get to share it with the person you love. Im quiet and gentle and cuddly and typically just a little on the lazy side, as I search for the perfect soft spot to take a nap. And wait until you see me carry my favorite stuffy toys around the house. They make me happy. Anyway though, Im getting ahead of myself.\nIm a darling, 7-year-old, 42-pound sweetheart, with an expressive face that will melt your heart and a delightful, easygoing, unassuming personality. And Im already mostly housebroken, as long as I get out on a regular schedule. I came to Wayside last summer, when my previous shelter was in the path of a hurricane. It ended up being the best thing for me, because I was able to get much needed vet care as well as extra TLC from the Wayside staff. Im currently staying in a foster home as I rest and recuperate and to give me a break from shelter life. Foster Mom and I have so much fun together, living the simple life and savoring each day. Ive never been happier in my whole life!\nIve had my fair share of health issues, but I never complain or feel sorry for myself. I came to Wayside with a bad case of heartworm disease, which has been treated, but it had already somewhat damaged my lungs and heart, causing me to tire easily. I also had masses removed from my chest area and I may have to have more surgeries for this in the future. Ive had a hard life and sometimes I just feel tired. But I never lose my zest for life! Im happy and I find that each new day is a reason to celebrate. Im looking for an adopter who will be there for me and make sure I have regular veterinary care. I have so much love to offer and living left to do! I just need your help with that. Please dont pass me by just because I need a little extra care.\nIm perfect in the house! Foster Mom says Im the sweetest dog shes ever fostered. I like to snuggle and cuddle on the couch with an occasional play session mixed in for fun. Im quiet and calm and I dont bother a thing. Well, I do like to check out what youre having to eat though. Im not aggressive around food at all, but I like to snag a taste when I can. After all, isnt food meant to be shared with those you love? Ha! I just know from my past that its important to eat when you have the chance. I listen well and Im eager to please. Now that Ive discovered this little luxury called furniture, I cant get enough. I hope youll allow me to lounge on the couch or curl up in a chair. I love to be comfortable and, well, I deserve it!\nId love a quiet, calm, slow lifestyle where I can live my life in peace. I get easily tired, so I prefer not to have lots of stairs to climb. And I need a home without other animals. Im not typically reactive when I see other dogs at a distance during a walk, but I cant live with them, and Im not the sort of dog that you can take to a dog park or doggie daycare. I just need to keep my distance. I promise you Ill give you so much love that Ill be enough for you though! Mostly, I just want to be around my people, soaking up all the love you will give me. And Ill give it right back to you!\nLife can be so hard, especially when youre all alone. And you do the best you can with what you have, but sometimes it takes someone special to step into your life and make all the difference. Ive had that now and I feel the love. Im just a sweet and simple dog looking for you to come into my life and never leave.\nLove, Camel\nP.S. I'm back at the shelter now, so please arrange to come on out to meet me! I'm waiting for you!\n ...",

            "description": "Hellooooo Kansas City! Im Marley.\nI feel so flattered that you paused to let me tell you about myself. I am two years old and 65 pounds of pure sweetness. I have come such a long way in the past two months that Ive been at Wayside. A really nice officer found me roaming the streets alone and could tell I needed a warm place to lay my head and nice people to help me be my best self and that Wayside would be that place. He definitely was right about that!\nBecause of my rough start to life, I can be pretty nervous but settle in quickly once Ive had some time to get acclimated to my new environment. Ive never had toys of my own or people to give me treats so I havent quite figured out how fun those things can be and dont seem to show much interest. I have heard my two-legged friends here at Wayside talk about how amazing squeakies, plushies, kongs, and treats are so Im excited to have some of my own in my future home! Since I can be a little nervous, I will need to go to a home with kids 6 and up. Sometimes younger kids quick movements can startle me so I just want to make sure my new family can be as relaxed as me at home!\nSince Ive been at Wayside for over two months now, Ive gotten to participate in Waysides Field Trip program. Its been AMAZING! Two really nice volunteers have taken me to places like Sonic, Burger King, the agility park (and regular park), and the Lowes parking lot. I did great at all of these places and loved getting to smell all the smells and eating all the yummy treats. I totally get why humans like fast food so much! I didnt mind the car but would get nervous sometimes its so hard not to when things are zooming by you so fast! Speaking of zooming, at the agility park I loved zooming around all the open space! I went through the tunnel and showed the volunteer how I already know some tricks like sit, down, and shake! I also loved sniffing out snacks in the grass my nose is my favorite if you couldnt tell! I also got to be an office foster. This means I got to hang out all day in someones cozy office instead of in my kennel. I greeted everyone who came into the office so nicely and always put my head in perfect position for a good scratch! My friend whose office I hung out in realized that once you are in my inner circle, I have so much love to give and can be so fun!\nI know my photos make me all look so serious I havent quite learned how to smile. I know that smile will come once my forever family finds me and is ready to share all their love with me, the way I am ready to share my love with them. I hope youll come meet me and make me part of your family very soon.\nLots of love,\nMarley\n ...",

            "description": "Scroll through Pwags photos to see him in action!\nHelloooooo Kansas City, Professor Wagglesworth here but my friends call me PWags for short! Cant wait to tell you a little (or a lot, really) about me. First off, I am 1.5 years old and a perfect size of 46 pounds. I have a real zest for life and have been working so hard at Wayside to be the best version of myself to make someone an amazing companion for life!\nI just passed my 150th day at Wayside and am still waiting for my people to call Wayside, ask to meet me, and take me home. Even though Ive been here quite a long time, I know the best things in life (like finding my forever family) just take time. The kind people at Wayside remind me everyday that I am so special and will make someone so happy, its just a matter of those special people finding me! I recently got to spend one night in a potential foster home and it was so amazing to get a taste of what life will be like once I do find my family. All I wanted the entire time was to get nice belly and head scratches. I also just love to cuddle! I like to think Im really the perfect combination of fun and chill. I LOVE to play, especially with toys. I also am like a puppy in the sense that I love to chew on things so I hope my future family will get me a bone or two to work on theyre just so fun! I also have been doing some puzzles at Wayside which has been great. Sometimes the days can feel long, especially after all this time at the shelter, so its nice to get to do fun things like this to help pass the time.\nSpeaking of fun things I also got to be an Office Foster for a day! This means that I got to spend some time outside of my kennel at Wayside which was so relaxing for me! It also means that I would be a great co-worker for you if you work from home!! If you dont work from home, I dont seem to mind the kennel so I would be happy to wait patiently for you to get home so we can spend time together then instead!\nMy friends here at the shelter have noted that I am really the best version of myself when I am on a routine of some sort. I will need a family that is committed to positive reinforcement training since I am still working on being the best version of myself. I have done well during playdates with other dogs here at the shelter but sometimes can get so excited that my new friends dont have as much fun as me. I definitely am open to going to a home with another four-legged friend but will need to meet them before heading home to make sure we are a great fit for each other. In my foster home I did live with a cat and she didnt seem to bother me! I will also need to go to a home with kids over the age of 10 and will need to meet any other family members living in the home before we make things official! Since Ive spent so much time in shelters, I just want to make sure that when I go home that its for forever this time!\nIf you think that we could be a good match for each other, we should participate in Waysides Slumber Paw-ty program. This means that you could take me home for a week to see if we are BFF potential and Wayside would provide all the items you would need to care for me. Its really an awesome thing. I hope to meet you soon!\nTail wags and wet nose kisses,\nPWags\n ...",

            "description": "Hi there, I'm Rey! Im friendly and athletic and curious and loads of fun. I have an independent streak, so I wont constantly bother you for attention. But Im always game to exercise or hang out or have a little fun together. If youre familiar with and a fan of my breed, you will love me, because Im a typical Akitaa silly and affectionate soul who thrives on human companionship and the love of family.\nIm a gorgeous, 5 year old, 56-pound sweetheart with an adorable, expressive face and an enthusiastic, spunky personality. I am truly beautiful both inside and out. And I think I may be already kennel trained, because I keep my area at Wayside clean and I know to go to the bathroom when I get outside. I came to Wayside as a transfer from a shelter in Louisiana when they were short on space. Im doing great here and Ive made lots of wonderful friends, but I have to admit that Im so tired of being homeless. Its time for me to find my family, so I hope youll come out to meet me and give me a chance to show you what a good dog I am.\nIve recently enrolled in a training program here at Wayside where Im learning basic commands and manners. I have so much fun working with my training partner! Im thriving with the extra attention and focus. Im smart and I love to learn, so I hope you continue to teach me throughout my life. I will do best with a patient and consistent family who will praise me when Im a good girl. I already know how to sit for my treats and I promise to take them gently from your hand. I love to play with my toys! They make me happy. I cant wait to spend my days with you, making you proud to have me as your dog.\nBesides training and mental stimulation in my life, I will need regular daily exercise to help me stay happy, healthy, and calm. I like to keep both my mind and body busy. I am a strong, athletic dog and Im still working on my leash skills. I hope you can help me with that because I love going for walks or runs with you. I like to sniff and explore during my walks, curious of all that nature has to offer. I can climb a fence, so, if I have a fence in my new home, Ill need it to be at least 6 feet tall. Even then, I will need you to supervise me when Im outside to make sure I stay safe and secure. I can be picky about my dog friends and I do best with playful yet tolerant dogs. If you have another, I will need to meet them before we go home together, to make sure were a good match. I need a home without cats or small, furry animals because I like to chase them. I also need a home with kids over the age of at least 10. Im strong and still learning not to jump on people. Ive already made tons of progress during my stay at Wayside and I anticipate continuing to get better and better with time and training. \nFamily is everything to me. Its all I think about. I cant wait to share my life with you and bring a little sunshine and fun into your world. I cant wait to be your dog.\nLove,Rey\n ...",

            "description": "Hi there, Im Brodie!Im a friendly, goofy, happy dog who loves life. I believe that every single day is a reason to celebrate, no matter what circumstance it holds. I may not have had the ideal puppyhood, but today is a new day and I intend to savor it. Id love to share my zest for life with you!\nIm a handsome, 1 year old, 49-pound sweetheart, with beautiful brindle fur, a bright smile, and an enthusiastic, delightful personality. I cant wait to make you laugh with my silly antics. I came to Wayside after I was rescued by the ASPCA. I was so happy to be here that I found myself jumping on everyone in pure joy to show my exuberance! Ha! Since that first day, Ive learned so much and Ive made great strides. I graduated from Waysides Peace Academy, which helps high energy dogs like me learn focus and manners. Ive been working really hard to learn appropriate behavior while still maintaining my charming love for life. Im so ready for my new life with you to begin! Im tired of being homeless.\nAfter I graduated from the Peace Academy, I enrolled in the next level of training at Wayside. I am a superstar and one smart cookie who picks up on things very quickly. Nothing makes me happier than getting love and attention from my favorite people, so training sessions are my favorite time of the day. Ive already learned all sorts of commands as well as leash skills and basic manners. I love to make you proud of me and I try my best every day to learn something new.\nNow that Ive been around awhile, I get chosen to go on field trips with the volunteers! Its an incredible time because it gives me a break from the shelter and teaches me about life on the outside. Everything is new to me and I love it all! Im getting used to the car rides and I find them quite enjoyable. I love to go walking or hiking in the local parks. And of course, a picnic is in order. I also enjoy hanging out and exploring at Petco, where Im friendly to everyone I meet. I like to pick out a special toy to take back to the shelter with me. I do love my toys! My only complaint is that I dont want these fun outings to end. I wish they could last forever! My friends reassure me that every day will be like one big, fun field trip once Im adopted. I cant wait!\nIm looking for a home and family that will continue my training and provide me with extra exercise to help me stay happy, healthy, and calm. I will thrive in a patient, positive, and consistent environment. Please praise me when Im a good boy so that I can learn what you expect from me. Im super sweet and I love to spend time with my people. Daily exercise is important to me and Im a great partner if you feel like walking or running or hiking. My leash skills are phenomenalI wait patiently to be leashed up and then I walk right by your side, frequently looking to you for direction during our entire walk. I hope to have a fenced yard at my new home as well, for extra playtime. Im an expert at the game of fetch!\nI was never socialized much with other dogs in my past, but Ive been working on that during my time at Wayside. I can be picky with other dogs, but Ive made some great friends who also have a high energy play style, and we love to run and play together. If you have another dog, I will need to meet them before we go home together, to make sure were a good fit for each other. And Im looking for a home with kids over the age of at least 6. The Wayside staff is setting me up for success by helping to find the best match for me. I like that.\nLife isnt meant to be spent alone; I can attest to that. I long to be part of a family. I will be there for you no matter what life holdsmaking you smile, bringing comfort, helping you stay in shape. I promise to bring a little sunshine and fun into your life every single day. Please just give me a chance to shine!\nLove, Brodie\n ...",

            "description": "**Check out Angelos video by scrolling through his photos!**\nHi there, Im Angelo! Im a happy, affectionate boy who loves to be with my people. Ill greet you each day with the most beautiful smile and a joyous wag of my tail, just to show you how much you mean to me. Ive never had much in life, so I savor and appreciate every bit of good that comes my way. I cant wait to be your loyal companion and best buddy.\nIm a handsome and strong, 4 year old, 58-pound sweetheart with a gentle spirit and soulful eyes to go along with my delightful personality. And Im already housebroken! Please stay patient with me though when we get home, because Ive been living at the shelter for a while now and its hard to keep up my routine here. I promise to try my best to follow all the rules of my new home. I came to Wayside as a transfer from another shelter. Even though its not quite a real home, I understand that this is just another stop on my journey, so Im making the most of it. Ive had some of the best days of my life at Wayside, and everything Ive experienced has helped to prepare me for my new home with you. But Im tired of being homeless and life in a shelter can be stressful. So, I hope you come for me soon!\nIve made lots of new friends and the volunteers think Im pretty special! In fact, my best friend comes in every Monday to take me for a field trip, giving me a break from shelter life. I find that the most important things in life sometimes leave us without adequate words, and this is one of those occasions. When youve lived in a shelter for so long, its hard to describe the feeling of a few hours of freedom with your friend. But Ill try. I love going for car rides and Im an excellent rider, sometimes resting my head on your shoulder, just to feel the connection. My friend and I have a routine. We go to the McDonalds drive through for a treat and then share it during a picnic at the park. I love to go for walks and meet people along the way. Next stop is Petco, where I greet all the employees and pick out a new toy. Lowes is another favorite stop. All the employees are so happy to see my wagging tail and big smile. Im a regular there and I savor the love and attention. Monday is my favorite day of the week!\nI was recently chosen for a slumber pawty by a potential adopter. It didnt end up working out for me, because I didnt get along with the resident cat, but I had such an excellent time! I got to sleep in the bed at nightbest sleep Ive had in ages! I didnt have any accidents and I did just fine in my crate when no one was home. I loved running and playing in the fenced yard. Simply hanging out with the family was my favorite thing to do. I just loved that feeling of belonging that comes with being a member of a family. They said I was a great dog and such a nice friend.\nIm currently enrolled in a weekly training class, which I love. Ive made excellent progress, learning basic commands and manners in a positive, structured, consistent environment. I have a strong will, so I need a family who can establish and maintain boundaries with me while providing me with mental and physical stimulation. Daily exercise helps me stay happy, healthy, and calm. Im a friendly and playful dog and I love to go for walks or play with my toys. Id love a home and family where I can be included in activities and fun. I prefer dogs that are my size or larger or I'll be happy as your only dog as well. If you do have another dog that is on the small side, please bring them out to Wayside to meet me to make sure were a good fit for each other. I do need a home without cats. And due to my size and strength, I will also need a home with kids over the age of 10. I really want this adoption to last forever, so lets make sure were a good match from the start!\nBeing homeless has taught me never to take things for granted. A simple car ride, a picnic, fresh air, someone to share my day with, attention from the people I lovethese are the things that make me happy. Now I want to share my life with you and be there for each other the way families do. I will be so proud to be your dog, every single day for the rest of my life!\nLove, Angelo\n ...",

It might take me just a little extra time to warm up, but once we bond, I will be your best companion ever. I just need someone to believe in me and love me, so that we can do all the things that families do together and for each other. Im ready for the next chapter of my life to begin!\nIm a handsome, 2-year-old, 50-pound sweetheart with gentle eyes and a happy, delightful personality. I love being around my people! And I think I might already be housebroken, because I keep my kennel clean and I know to go to the bathroom when I get outside. Please stay patient with me though, as I get used to my new routine with you. I came to Wayside when someone abandoned me on the property. I dont know why that happened, but I felt so alone and humiliated. When the staff welcomed me in, I was confused and afraid, but my sweet, affectionate personality started shining through when they offered me treats and gentle praise. That felt good!\nI already know all sorts of commands that I cant wait to show you, including Sit, Down, Shake, High Five, and Touch. I hope you will continue to teach me throughout my life because I love to learn new things. If you stay patient with me and praise me when Im a good boy, Ill quickly learn what you expect from me and gain confidence at the same time. I love to play with my toys and especially balls! They make me happy. I wont bother you for constant attention, but when you call my name, Ill be there as fast as I can! I like to spend time with you and soak up the attention you give. I love tasty treats and I take them gently from your hand. Im just an all-around nice dog.\nIm an athletic guy and I love to play and act silly. I never turn down a fun game of fetch and Im an expert at it! I also enjoy going for a daily walk. I hope youll let me go at my own pace when we get home. I like to take things slowly and get comfortable with my environment in my own time. I will thrive in a calm, quiet, positive, consistent home where I know what to expect. Im looking for a home without a lot of commotion and I like my space, so Ill need a home with kids over the age of at least 6. And I need to be your only dog, but I promise to give you so much love that Ill be enough. \nIm so excited about what my future holds! Its been quite a journey for me and it hasnt always been easy, but I feel in my bones that this is where I need to be in order for you to find me. I cant wait to share my life with you and be your best friend.\nLove, Dusk\n ...",

We also believe he has some Petit Basset Griffon Vendeen AKA pbgv. Frankie has lived as an outside dog his entire life and deserves to finally be part of a family. He will definitely need some help learning how to live in a home and he has a bit of separation anxiety, but he is extremely sweet and seems to get along fine with other dogs. He would love a calm household with at least one other dog and an owner that is home a lot   He is overweight and needs to lose about 10 lbs.\n\nTo adopt Frankie you must have:\n-House, townhouse, or condo with private yard\n- one other friendly dog\n-Owner that enjoys walking with their dog and that has experience with timid /anxious dogs\n-No kids under 8\n-Willingness to work with him on house training\n\nIf you live locally in the Los Angeles or Ventura area, please send us an email for an application to jjwoofinpaws@gmail.com",

We also believe he has some Petit Basset Griffon Vendeen AKA pbgv. Rambo has lived as an outside dog his entire life and deserves to finally be part of a family. He will definitely need some help learning how to live in a home , but he is extremely sweet and confident  and seems to get along fine with other dogs. He would love an active household with at least one other more submissive dog.  He definitely has an alpha personality .  He is also super cuddly and  love to  snuggle with his human. He is overweight and needs to lose about 10 lbs.\n\nTo adopt Rambo you must have:\n-House, townhouse, or condo witha private securely fenced yard\n- at least one other medium or large dog friendly dog (preferably more submissive in personality)\n-Owner that enjoys walking with their dog and that has experience with timid dogs\n-No kids under 8\n-Willingness to work with him on house training\n\nIf you live locally in the Los Angeles or Ventura area, please send us an email for an application to jjwoofinpaws@gmail.com",

We are open intake, meaning we can not turn away animals from either county we serve. Our shelter intakes double or triple it's capacity every month so it is essential we place animals quickly into adoptive homes. Since so many animals enter the shelter we often don't have enough volunteers to write an individual bio for each. Please feel free to call the shelter Wednesday-Sunday to inquire about the animal you are interested in. 706-795-2868.\n\nViewing and adoption hours at our shelter are Wednesday through Sunday from 12 PM to 5 PM. \nAll adoption fees include age-appropriate vaccinations, flea treatment, deworming, and spay or neuter, microchip, and adoption packet. \nFees:\nDogs over 4 months old: $100\nPuppies under 4 months: $125. \nCats and Kittens are $75 ($65 without microchip). \n\nFor your convenience you can fill out an adoption application for any of our current residents at www.moaspets.com. Join us on Facebook at\nhttps://www.facebook.com/moaspets. It's a great way to stay up to the minute on the furry 4 legged friends we have looking for a loving forever home. \nWe are located at:\n1888 Colbert Danielsville Rd \nDanielsville, GA 30633 \n706-795-2868\n\nNOTE: Our adoptions are first come first served, simply filling out an application does not mean the animal will be held for you, you must come meet the animal in person in order to be considered for adoption.\nIf you rent you must bring your lease or a letter from your landlord stating you may adopt.",

She had a bad skin infection and no fur and was no far from being euthanized before we stepped in and saved her. She went into a foster home who cared for her skin problem and now look at her. She's got such beautiful marble colored markings. She's a possible great pry or shepherd mix about 3 years old and just a great gal. She's gotten some training and is crate trained. She gets along with all dogs and humans but has not been cat tested. She has average energy and moderate shedding. \n\nShe is currently in Fort Worth, TX but will making the trek to Olympia, WA scheduled to arrive on Saturday Jan 23rd IF she is pre-adopted meaning you need to get your app in, approved and pay the adoption fee to secure her.  Her adoption fee is $450 which covers her spay, vaccinations, HW testing, chipping, health certificate and transport fees. All our dogs come with a 30 day, money back, trial period to make sure they are the right fit in your environment.

He is good on leash, enjoys being with his people, and loves treats which comes in handy when you are working on training with him. \n\nButler would do great in a patient and quiet home that can help him come out of his shell and become more confident. He is good with other dogs, has not been tested with cats, and is ok with kids over 12. \n\nButler needs another playful dog around his size or up in the home.\n\nButler is UTD on shots, neutered and microchipped. His adoption fee is $450.",

She came to us in season and we were unsure if she was expecting but after about 6 weeks it was evident and thus she gave birth in rescue to an adorable litter of health puppies. Milli is figured to be primarily a Shepherd x Lab cross with possibly a little bit of pittie because of her weak brindling coloration but she does not show any other feature of pitbull (this is only a guess). Milli is a healthy 55# girl that is patiently waiting to be spayed now that her puppies have been weaned from her. \nMilli is vaccinated, dewormed, will be chipped prior to adoption, HWT - negative, and awaiting spay. If Milli is adopted prior to her spay she will have to require a spay/neuter contract to be signed. \nMilli has been around various animals in her foster home and she has shown soe prey instincts towards cats and she is slightly aggressive with dogs smaller than her, she has been doing well with the dogs that are 70# or larger. Milli is quiet natured and submissive with people. She is an attention hog and loves hugs, belly rubs and good ear scratches. She will require a fenced yard as she does want to run off. She is not much for playing with toys but will chew on antlers, buffalo horns, and nylabones. She does know some obedience skills like sit and down (to lay down) and off.",

Due to the current regulations set forth by Governor Pritzker on group gatherings we will not be having adoption events until further notice. As an all foster based rescue this means that all meets will be by appointment only. Your whole family must be available to attend the meet as there will be no second meets scheduled to help limit contact between our team and the public. To help streamline the process please make sure your current pets are up to date, you have landlord/HOA approval, and that you are prepared to take the dog home with you immediately before submitting an application. Thank you & Please stay safe!***\n\nNetwork to us from a rescue partner in the south Lelo just arrived. Approximately 2 years old and 52 lbs this gal is as sweet as they come.\nLelo is a super curious, sweet and docile young pup. She is well behaved, and house-trained. She lo\n\nves pets and kisses and keeps a constant eye on her people. She understand the commands to sit and come, but needs to learn to not jump up when she gets overly excited. She takes treats with a gentle mouth and sleeps well in her crate. She'll be a great dog for an active person or family.\n\nCheck back for more information and possible restrictions once he fully settles into foster care.\n\nIf you are interested in adoption, please complete the Application to Adopt which you can find on our website (\nwww.magnificentmutts.org\n) No phone calls please. Emails only.\n\nAdoption Donation $300 (cash only)\n\nPlease visit www.magnificentmutts.org for the online dog or cat application.\n\nAdoption Fees*\n\nAdult cats starting at $125, Kittens starting at $165.\nDogs/Puppies starting at $225 minimum\nPrices subject to change, please contact for specific adoption donations.",

For our application, please email rescuebc@hotmail.com  Include your location and a phone number for future communication.\nThe first step in our process is to submit an application for review.

She found the toys and made herself at home. She is happy to play by herself but does love other dogs. She is good at listening to social queues but can push her luck sometimes. \n She loves her comfort either lying on the couch beside you or taking over the comfiest bed. She loves to romp in the snow. She walks well on a leash. She is fun and quirky e.g. she sploofs instead of lying down. She is just an all round lovely girl!\n\nInterested in this sweet young dog?

She\u2019s around 54 lbs., two years old, spayed, heart worm negative, house trained, and kennel trained.  She gets along GREAT with dogs but has that typical high-octane pitty energy, so having another dog that would equal that would be best.  She loves people, and playing with toys is her favorite past time! Not sure about cats. This sweetheart is ready to bring love and adventure to your home.\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq\n\n*Any breed labels used by Take Paws Rescue, its employees/volunteers, or on vet records provided cannot be guaranteed.  Breed labels are given based on information obtained during intake and/or best guesses based on appearance and/or temperament of the dogs and Take Paws Rescue gives no assurance to the accuracy of these labels. Labels are necessary for postings to many animal networking sites, such as Pet Finder, and are no way a guarantee. Additionally, exact age and potential size cannot be guaranteed.",

When, after 2 months nobody claimed him, Diamonds stepped in to find him a new home.\n\nCade is currently living with his foster mom, who describes him as an overgrown lap dog. He absolutely loves to snuggle and wants to be wherever his person is. His current favorite place to be is snuggled up on his bed next to the fireplace.\n\nCade is fully housebroken and has absolutely no problem being left alone, however no crates please, this boy hates being contained. Cade loves chewing on his bones and is very good at knowing what is his to chew on and what is not. Cade also has had basic leash training and loves to go on long walks. He is extremely treat motivated and knows basic commands.\n\nCade's ideal home would be one that is quiet and structured. He is good with children, however, older/respectful children would be ideal as he can get a little overzealous when excited. A home without cats is a must. Cade is currently not dog friendly, however has shown promise that he eventually could be with the proper training and socialization. Adoption donation includes Spay/Neuter, UTD on Vaccinations, deworming, and flea treatment.",

He is so unique\u2026but no blue fur or a long nose!  His right eye was recently enucleated, and it took him a bit to get used to it missing.  Gonzo is a character, and one of the most affectionate dogs we have ever had!  He is probably a Cockapoo, 3 yrs old, 15 lbs and full of cuddles and kisses.  He looked like Pic #4 when we got him\u2026so  sad and forlorn!\n\nBut look at him now!!  He looks like a puppy and acts like a puppy!  He is soooooo loveable.  He is good with everyone.  When he arrived, he did a little submissive peeing\u2026but that has improved 90%.  He was a little frightened and needed to settle down.  But\u2026you have to be prepared \u2014 just know he grows out of it!  Gonzo wants to engage with YOU, so he would not be good in a home where someone else cares for him.  He needs to bond and when he does, he\u2019s really a Velcro dog who loves his toys (see the video), loves to give kisses, plays fetch the ball, would love older kids (8+) and LOVES YOU!  He is a little socially awkward in crowds or where there are loud noises\u2026he likes other dogs, but not as much as he likes people.  We have seen him blossom but know he has more blossoming to go!  Gonzo doesn\u2019t have separation anxiety, he just gets sad when he is alone.  He isn\u2019t a barker, he\u2019s a lover not a fighter!  We don\u2019t think he\u2019s a daredevil like his namesake\u2026.but who knows what lies ahead!  He will need training and attention\u2026but you can\u2019t go wrong with this GONZO MAN!!\n\nOur website is updated daily. Please do not apply for this dog unless your home fits the specified criteria. All of our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, groomed, vet checked, dewormed, deflea'd and come with a leash, collar and ID If you are interested in adopting this dog from Lhasa Happy Homes, please complete the adoption application via the link below: Adoption (Online) Application: https://lhasahappyhomes.org/adoptions/adoption-application/. We will contact you once it has been reviewed. \n\nDuring the COVID-19 quarantine, Lhasa Happy Homes will NOT be holding weekly adoption events. We will set up individual meet & greets with APPROVED applicants once they have submitted a video tour of their home. \n\nYou can check our Events Calendar at http://www.lhasahappyhomes.org/HLM_Custom_Calendar.aspx.\n\nThanks for thinking rescue and adoption\u2026and for considering saving a life. It will be the best gift you ever give yourself or your family.",

            "description": "Barks and Meows Rescue introduces Precious. She is a Romanian Mioritic Sheepdog that may have some Caucasian Shepherd in her as both breeds were being bred there. She was surrendered to our rescue at 8 months of age, having come from a Backyard Breeder who was closing down. She has long fur which will require professional grooming 4 times a year. Precious shows all the wonderful traits of the Romanian Mioritic Sheepdog. She is very loving with the family in her foster home and enjoys meeting new people. This breed is a guardian breed so would protect the family if needed. Continuing socialization is the key to ensuring she remains always an outgoing, fun dog to be around. Precious is wonderful with the three children in the home, ages 8-14. She plays with the other two male dogs and definitely loves the cooler weather and snow. They are not known for huge appetites so she is eating 2 cups of food, twice daily. Precious is eating large breed puppy food and will remain on it until she is 18 months of age. She is only halfway through her growing stage and currently weighs about 82 pounds. She has long legs and gigantic paws. Her family has taught her to walk on a leash, which was a huge task in itself. She takes her trust of other people from her family members. If they like the person, she will as well. She has a deep bark, only using it if need be. This breed is not a yappy one. She usually sleeps on the couch and sometimes beside the bed. They get warm very easily so enjoy laying on a cold floor in the warmer months. She did meet a cat outside of the cage at PetValue and didn't even look at it. Precious loves all dogs including puppies. She has lived amongst multiple dogs her entire life, so a second large socialized canine will be mandatory in her new home. She has gone for a groom and did very well but laid down in the tub. She does well in the car ride now that she can walk on a lead. She does hate the body harness so she is walked on a Martindale collar. The ideal home for Precious is one where the family is patient with her as she came to us quite feral. She has learned to trust her family members, so kindness, patience, and consistency are key. She is used to the children in the home, who are very dog savvy, working with her on tricks, leash training, etc. We would like to see her in a home with children 8 years up who all have guardian breed experience. She really doesn't realize how big she is and is a giant lap dog. She has had issues with some female dogs in the past so best suited as an only dog. Precious is spayed, up to date with vaccines, and dewormed. A fully fenced yard, children 8 years plus, and a Veterinarian History of Compliance are mandatory to apply for Precious.\nVisit barksandmeows.ca for an online application.

            "description": "***ADOPTION PENDING***\n\nPLEASE READ THIS PROFILE AND THE REQUESTED CRITERIA BEFORE CALLING OR SUBMITTING AN APPLICATION. THANKS FOR YOUR ATTENTION AND CONSIDERATION \n\nTHIS IS SASHA\u2026a zaftig, tan/white, 23.5 lbs (yes, she\u2019s on a diet) Lhasa Apso\u2026and she\u2019s a doll!!  Sasha came from a senior home where she was very loved but spoiled.  Because of health reasons (mom) they had to give her up.  Sasha was groomed monthly, vetted properly, very loved but she wasn\u2019t walked or fed on a schedule.  So, she had gained a few \u201cCovid\u201d pounds!  She loves treats but is a bit picky in the food department \u2014 but she is learning. \n\nShe loves to go for walks at a brisk pace now!  For this reason, she wold not be good in a senior home.  She needs several walks daily and she\u2019s pretty good.  She wakes up at 7:30am every morning and asks to go out!  She will have an accident here and there (usually on a pp pad)\u2026but she is doing well.  We taught her how to walk up and down the stairs and she learned in two days! \n\nWe were told that Sasha has a couple of issues, she\u2019s a Lhasa after all!  We have not seen them yet, but she will let you know if she doesn\u2019t like something.  SHE IS NOT AGGRESSIVE.  She can be food possessive if you drop food on the floor and she wants it \u2014 just don\u2019t try to take it out of her mouth!  She is great with other dogs \u2014 she\u2019ll even let them eat out of her bowl and she loves to play with them.  She won\u2019t let you clean her behind, so don\u2019t try (unless you are tricky and fast)!   Sasha has blossomed in her foster home and shown that she definitely wants another small, active dog as her companion; NO cats and she doesn\u2019t like being left alone all day.  That being said, she can be independent in the house.   She is a wonderful companion and ultimately will give you lots of kisses!  Loves toys!!  No kids, because of her food issues, and it would be best for her to live in a house because she is a great watch dog and will bark if she hears noises.  Sasha is a wonderful dog but she needs alpha owners who will take charge of her.  Otherwise, she will take charge of you!  Does Sasha sound like a dog you could love?  WE DO!!!\n\nOur website is updated daily. Please do not apply for this dog unless your home fits the specified criteria. All of our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, groomed, vet checked, dewormed, deflea'd and come with a leash, collar and ID If you are interested in adopting this dog from Lhasa Happy Homes, please complete the adoption application via the link below: Adoption (Online) Application: https://lhasahappyhomes.org/adoptions/adoption-application/. We will contact you once it has been reviewed. \n\nDuring the COVID-19 quarantine, Lhasa Happy Homes will NOT be holding weekly adoption events. We will set up individual meet & greets with APPROVED applicants once they have submitted a video tour of their home. \n\nYou can check our Events Calendar at http://www.lhasahappyhomes.org/HLM_Custom_Calendar.aspx.\n\nThanks for thinking rescue and adoption\u2026and for considering saving a life. It will be the best gift you ever give yourself or your family.",

            "description": "Meet Echo! \n\nAfter being dumped in the middle of the country, Echo found herself surrounded by cornfields all alone. Unfortunately we do not know how long she was there, but from her emaciated state we assume she had spent some time there. As you can imagine, Echo was absolutely petrified when she arrived to her foster home. Everything she had ever known had changed and her world had turned upside down. Echo was found with a harness on, and after several weeks in her foster home she finally felt safe. But it was clear that someone love Echo before... she knows several tricks and is already potty trained. \n\nEcho is a special girl who will need an owner who knows that sometimes the world is still scary for Echo. As many Great Danes are, Echo is very sensitive and her spirit is still rebuilding. She feels that she has to protect her food and her favorite things from other dogs when she first meets them, but with slow introductions Echo will stop protecting these things. This behavior is common with dogs who have been neglected. Echo is currently living with several other dogs and is doing well with them. \n\nOnce Echo trusts you, she will love you forever. She is goofy, playful, and is all Dane! She loves to chew on her favorite benebone, but is afraid of squeaky toys. She loves to run around the yard, but she\u2019s still too afraid to go on walks. \n\nEcho needs someone to take the time to build trust. She needs someone who will move slow. She needs someone to show her that life is good again, and that she\u2019s going to be okay. \n\nEcho is around a year old. She is approximately 90lbs and is expected to grow a bit more. She came to us thin and will need time to gain the weight she needs. She is spayed, vaccinated, heartworm tested, microchipped, dewormed, current on flea and heartworm prevention, and has had a gastropexy done. Echos adoption fee is $425. \n\nREQUIREMENTS\n- secure fully fenced yard. \n- no children \n-a low traffic home without frequent visitors \n-previous experience with owning a large breed dog, or ability to demonstrate research done on owning a large breed dog. \n- a patient owner who will make sure introductions to other dogs is slow. \n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Echo, apply today at farfetcheddogrescue.org",

Ellie Mae is looking at some difficult months ahead while we find out if her heart with a grade 4 murmur can withstand some mammary tumor removals.  So if you have either the financial ability to help or the heart to adopt this tiny peanut for as long as she has - please reach out!\n\nEllie Mae is currently in a foster home and spends her days with her furr-foster brothers/sisters and this pint-size Alpha dog stands on her own!  She is a sweet girl and would love nothing more than a fuzzy bed right beside you for the rest of her days.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please reach out to adoptsch@gmail.com and ask for an application.  After receipt, we can arrange a meet and greet with Ellie Mae.",

I am a 4 year-old, female, German Shepherd mix who is eager for a new home!\n\nI am serene and very affectionate, and enjoy gentle walks and soothing talks!\n\nMy ideal home would be as tranquil as I am. I can be upset by too much noise and activity. If we can match up in energy levels and style, you'll have a loyal friend for life.\n\nYou would love to add me to your family if you enjoy spending quiet and reflective time with your dog, and enjoy bonding as deeply as I do.\n\nReady to adopt or want to hear more about me? The shelter is open by appointment seven days a week! Just email adopt@sbhumanesociety.org to make an appointment today!\n\nWhen you take your new pet home, he or she will have been spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccinations, provided with a permanent microchip identification and a certificate for a free veterinary exam. Our partners at Purina brand dog and cat food also provide food to get you home. \n\nTransfer of animals may be available between our Santa Maria and Santa Barbara Campuses. If an animal you would like to meet is at the campus further away from you, just let us know when you email, and we will be in touch with you if a transfer is available. Our adoption fees help support our community programs and the next animal who needs our help!",

MDAS estimated he was 6 years old, but or vet thinks he's closer to eight years old; even though he's 70lb, he's got a smaller build to the average GSD. And he may be a senior, but this dog's got game - Lobo LOVES to play with tennis balls and can't wait to catch them in the air or chase them across the room!\nLobo is healthy, up to date on vaccines, has a microchip, neutered, and ready for his forever home! He is potty trained and just wants to stick to your side and follow you like a shadow. Even though he loves to play with his tennis balls, he enjoys taking it easy and chilling with you on the couch to watch Netflix too.\nLike most dogs, he has a warm up period... But once he gets used to you, he's a total velcro dog and will stick to you like glue! We think his ideal home would be as a solo dog to get all the attention and love, please no cats or small animals (he thinks they are fun to chase). Currently in his foster home he lives with older kids and doing great playing with them.\nIf you think your home would be a good fit for Lobo, please complete an adoption application.",

They are two peas in a pod\n\nand looking for an adoptive home together!\n\nThey love to be petted and have small snuggle sessions. They will be your shadow everywhere you go too. Both are potty trained and walk well on leashes. Chloe and Jorge are very attached to each other, and get nervous if the other isn't around, but they love people company too. They do well with the small dog in their foster home, but bark at larger dogs in true chihuahua fashion. Chloe is the timid and the shy one, while Jorge is more jovial. They love to play with kids and would do well with older dog savy children. Belly rubs are the best and boy, do they LOVE belly rubs! Anyone who takes these two bonded sweethearts will be lucky and loved for a long time! Apply to adopt Chloe and Jorge today at www.underhoundrailroad.org.\n\nChloe and Jorge are currently being fostered in North Carolina and may transport to their adoptive home.",

They are two peas in a pod\n\nand looking for an adoptive home together!\n\nThey love to be petted and have small snuggle sessions. They will be your shadow everywhere you go too. Both are potty trained and walk well on leashes. Chloe and Jorge are very attached to each other, and get nervous if the other isn't around, but they love people company too. They do well with the small dog in their foster home, but bark at larger dogs in true chihuahua fashion. Chloe is the timid and the shy one, while Jorge is more jovial. They love to play with kids and would do well with older dog savy children. Belly rubs are the best and boy, do they LOVE belly rubs! Anyone who takes these two bonded sweethearts will be lucky and loved for a long time! Apply to adopt Chloe and Jorge today at www.underhoundrailroad.org.\n\nChloe and Jorge are currently being fostered in North Carolina and may transport to their adoptive home.",

He gets along great with the bigger dog in this home.    Here is one bossy Chi that he doesn\u2019t much like.  His best home is either only dog or dog his size.  He would be fine with children and we always like 8 and older.  He is great with all people he has met and he gets to go to work with his mom to the grooming salon.  He is the shop favorite and very social.  He does not get along with cats so his home will need to be cat free.  He would do best with a fenced yard and would make a great companion for some active family.  He is smart and has a lot of the qualities of the Shepherd.  He is currently in Texas and can be adopted locally in Texas or we can work with one of the wonderful transporters to deliver him to Washington, Portland, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Vermont or all along the East Coast.  His adoption fee is 250 and transport is 185.  Rhode Island and Massachusetts are not states we adopt to because of the regulations imposed by these states. \n\nContact Marlene at 210-867-1769 or email to ccpalinquiries@gmail.com if you have questions.

He can't get enough of his toys and makes every moment of playtime count. He's such a happy-g0-lucky boy! Gus came to Dolly's Legacy after being confiscated by animal control in a small Missouri town due to neglect. He had been living outdoors and not receiving proper care. He is so grateful he's now a rescue dog! Gus is a male Hound/Lab mix who weighs 75 lbs and was born approximately 12-22-18. He is neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, given flea/tick preventative, dewormed. Gus had life-saving treatment for heartworm disease. He will need to remain on heartworm preventative for life, as is recommended for ALL dogs, and retested in 6 months to ensure he is heartworm free. Adoption fee is $400 to help offset the many expenses we have for vetting costs. We rely strictly on adoption fees and donations to continue to save the lives of orphaned & abandoned pets; 100% goes towards their care. If interested in adopting one of our available dogs or puppies, please complete an online adoption application at https://dollyslegacyanimalrescue.org/adopt/ You will be contacted by our adoption coordinator via email after your application has been reviewed & approved to schedule an appointment.",

A friendly playful dog really helps with that.. and she has a few to chose from in her foster home.\n\nBecause she is shy, she may easily be scared in a busy household and would do best in a home with older children.  Fiona 's new family should have a physical fenced yard to ensure that she gets enough exercise and potty breaks, as her leash skills are lacking some. \n\n\n\nIf interested in adopting please fill out our no obligation online application at www.puppypawsrescue.org \n\nNote: Our rescue requires that all adopter's current and prior animals are up-to-date on vaccinations (DHLPP & Rabies)  and preventatives (heartworm and flea and tick), unless there is a medical reason not allowing it.

Crate trained, No potty accidents Inside.  Fine in yard with no leash  just wants to sit and be with her foster family.  Other dogs should be ok, with slow introductions. She has a strong play style that other dogs need to get used to first.\n\nShe is currently still in her foster home in North Carolina. We are looking for a foster home  here in Maryland or the potential of a foster to adopt home to bring her here. From her NC foster:\n\nFrom being found as a stray and living in a cement shelter kennel for 6 months to cuddling with her foster sisters and napping on the sofa.\nIngrid is doing fabulous with routine. While she is still a bit overpowering in play with my girls, she quiets down with instruction.\nIngrid learned how to use the dog door and goes in and out when she needs.\nShe  still doesn't like to be left alone outside for long. She will come running to the door when she realizes nobody is outside with her.  I think she doesn't want to be \"left behind.\" Ingrid shows no other separation anxiety- she is perfect in her pen overnight and when we leave the house.\n\n\nIf interested in adopting please fill out our no obligation online application at www.puppypawsrescue.org \n\nNote: Our rescue requires that all adopter's current and prior animals are up-to-date on vaccinations (DHLPP & Rabies)  and preventatives (heartworm and flea and tick), unless there is a medical reason not allowing it.

            "description": "River is a one year old, 42 lb, female. She is in good health, up to date on vaccines, heartworm negative, and is awaiting her appointment for spay. This girl is a sweet heart! River enjoys other dogs and is kind to cats. She is crate trained and sleeps through the night.  We are working on leash  training and general life skills such as riding in cars and not jumping on people. River has spent time with kids and prefers children over 8 years old. \nThe first year of life has not been easy for this amazing girl. \nRiver's dream family would be fairly calm with lots of time for snuggles. River has an impressive bark and is not an option for apartment living. A fully fenced back yard is required. NO ELECTRIC  FENCED yards will be approved. \nIf you are serious about adopting River and meet these requirements,  please fill out the application at savealifepets.org/adopt.\nIf there is high interest, please expect a wait of at least 4 days for a response.",

He is neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, given flea/tick preventative, dewormed. Zeus had life-saving treatment for heartworm disease. He will need to remain on heartworm preventative for life, as is recommended for ALL dogs, and retested in 6 months to ensure he is heartworm free. Adoption fee is $450 to help offset the many expenses we have for vetting costs. We rely strictly on adoption fees and donations to continue to save the lives of orphaned & abandoned pets; 100% goes towards their care. If interested in adopting one of our available dogs or puppies, please complete an online adoption application at https://dollyslegacyanimalrescue.org/adopt/ You will be contacted by our adoption coordinator via email after your application has been reviewed & approved to schedule an appointment.",

A year ago Frida was saved by rescue near Skopje, Macedonia. She was emaciated and her front leg cut. Humans had let her down until a local hero step in and rescued her. She was treated by a vet and taken to the rescue kennel. Frida never lost her faith in humanity. She is a happy girl, loves everyone, kids and dogs. She gives so much love that you wouldn't think is possible. She is arriving in Los Angeles from Macedonia January 18th week. She has 3 legs and a minor heart murmur that is treated with medication, this doesn't stop her from running around and enjoying life and spreading love. She is looking for her perfect forever home where they would love her unconditionally.\n\nIf interested adopting, please contact Silvia for an adoption application or any questions you might.

            "description": "\tFrances is a ten-year-old Chihuahua mix.  She weighs around 15 lbs. is spayed, and will be up to date on her shots as of 1/26.  A few weeks ago, she had a full blood panel, and her teeth cleaned.  She is a very healthy girl.  She was given to us by a loving couple that had her since she was a puppy.  She slept in bed with them and was adored.  Unfortunately, this couple's two-year-old daughter was diagnosed with cancer, and their world fell apart.  They are spending so much time in and out of hospitals, Frances was not getting any attention.  She was depressed when she first came to our foster home.  She has holistic supplements she has been taking, and she is feeling more like herself.  If you are looking for a gentle, calm walking buddy, Frances is your gal. She literally lights up and does a happy dance when you say the word \u201cwalk.\u201d Being the older and wise lady she is, she reminds you to pause now and then to look (or sniff in her case) around and be present. She is a very easy-going, calm dog with lots of love to give though she may need a bit of time and space initially to establish safety and trust. She needs someone who understands patience to help her navigate this confusing stage of changing homes. Once you gain her trust, her cuddly and affectionate self would come out (though infrequently at first) via a warm gaze, wanting to be in your proximity and asking to be held. If you are interested in meeting Frances, fill out our easy online application. \n\nhttp://www.angelsinfurdogrescue.com/adoption-application/",

I love to cuddle, to play and be center of attention. My foster mom says I am one of the smartest puppies she has seen. She says I pick up on new puppy lessons daily. I am good with other dogs and cats. I love children but I am a puppy so sometimes my puppy teeth hurt when I play. I hope I find my furever family. I am such a good boy and I will get attached easily. Please no condos or apartments at this time.\nComplete Application\nYou must complete the adoption application in full to be considered for adoption. \nHome Check\nAll adoptions do require a home check.

            "description": "Have you met Macy?\n\nMacy was relinquished to the San Diego Humane Society by her family, who said they couldn't prevent her from escaping their home, and she had separation anxiety. They also said Macy had lived with young children and a small dog and was good with both. She does great with all of our little dogs here at Frosted Faces, and she's a favorite hiking buddy of our volunteers\n! Be sure to watch the cute videos of Macy hiking and showing off her \"sit\" and \"spin\". She's so cute! Macy is 12 years old and weighs 15 lbs.\n\nSweet Macy went on a two week Frosted Fling over the holidays, and she recently was scooped up to live in an awesome Foster home. We received a great update from her Foster Mom: \"\n\nMacy is settling in well in her foster home! We're still learning about her and letting her decompress, but I can confirm some of the things her previous Fling parents have noted:\n\n-Macy is a sweet 12 year old terrier who doesn't look or act her age. She has very few teeth and is a little itchy but doesn't have any major medical issues. She'll make a wonderful companion, even for children and other dogs!\n\n-She is potty trained! She hasn't asked to go out yet, but, with 3+ outings a day, she always does her business outside.\n\n-She sleeps through the night in her crate or her own bed. Snuggles are for the couch.\n\n- She is patient with our other foster Ida and shows no food guarding or aggression of any sort.\n\n- She has great hearing and knows \"sit\", \"spin\", and \"no\". We're working on being better at \"stay\". She's very smart and definitely trainable. Very food motivated.\n\n-She loves walks and jogs. She'll be a great hiker.\n\n- She climbs stairs like a pro and can easily get on/off the bed or couch.\n\n- She barks at the doorbell or if another dog barks at her. We live on the second floor and don't have any furniture under windows where she can watch pedestrians or squirrels, so she's been pretty quiet!\n\n-She has some anxiety and is known to be a skilled escape artist.\n\nSo far we are handling her \"flightiness\" by making sure she is in a snug fitting harness and on leash when outside and that we are very careful coming and going. She hasn't darted but is interested in the door. Macy did very well on a visit to foster grandma's house, as well. We made sure all the doors were secure and had no issues. She was a very polite house guest. There\n\nhave been conflicting reports about Macy's separation anxiety. We haven't left her alone yet but will do so soon and report back.\"\n\nCheck back soon for the next update on Macy!\n\nVisit us at Open House: Saturdays & Sundays, 10 am - 1 pm.\n\nLearn more about our programs at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family. No adoption\n\nfees, and we help with medical costs!\n\nApply to become family:\nwww.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\nUpdated 2/2\n\n/21 KG",

He went to the vet with a few broken toes in September, 2020 and has had a very long road to recovery ever since, but is finally done with all that and ready to find his forever family.  Having to wear a cast and a cone never stopped him though!  He is such a sweet, loving pup. He loves to run around in the backyard playing and chasing all day as well as sunbathing too.  He is never ready to go inside (typical Pyr)! He can be a little shy with big dogs, even though he himself is a big dog......it just takes him a bit to warm up.  He loves playing with small dogs like his Pomeranian foster brother, but don\u2019t worry he is oh so gentle. We are looking for a new forever home for him where there is another well matched companion dog for him.\n\nHerbert can be a bit timid and shy at first when meeting new people.  He is also scared of loud noises and will find the smallest place possible to hide. Once he gets to know you he will absolutely adore you! Herbert is completely potty trained and crate trained too. He likes cuddles and laying in bed with his humans. He knows the commands \u201csit\u201d and \u201cpaw\u201d and is super treat motivated. He is very vocal and loves to talk back too. Herbert was born around the end of March, 2020 and currently weighs approximately 51 lbs.  Herbert's new home must be located in the immediate area of Dallas/Ft. Worth, TX.\n\nIf you are interested in adding this pup to your family, please click here (or copy and paste https://www.dfwpuppatrol.com/info/adoption into your browser) to view our adoption info and where you will find the link to fill out our online Pre-Adoption Application.  Any questions can be directed to us at info@dfwpuppatrol.com.  All of our adoptable pups have a minimum requested adoption fee of $250 + tax  (pups 6 months and older) and $350  + tax (pups under 6 months old), regardless of our expenses, and it includes vaccinations, spay/neuter, heartworm test for pups 8 months and older, heartworm treatment if tested positive, deworming and/or fecal test, parasite treatment if tested positive, microchipping, any immediate known health issues, and pups 3 months and older are kept current on monthly heartworm prevention.\n",

Storm is a mixed breed , probably pit bull and Shar pei, but we are really guessing . Storm has come leaps and bounds since he has been with us over the last several months . Storm is excellent on a leash and very much enjoys going for walks. Storm appears to be dog friendly but we have not evaluated him with other dogs at this time; however when he meets dogs at the park fence he is very happy and respectful.  Storm shows absolutely no aggression to any human - he is happy and energetic. Storm is still very young and has a puppy personality- fun loving and silly!! Storm will need a continued training program and a daily exercise regime. If you would like to meet this beautiful, sweet boy please contact the shelter . \n",

He is a beautiful dog who still has some growing to do. He still has that puppy energy. He will need an active home with structure and also another dog in the home preferred. He is doing great with his kennel training and goes right in. He whines for a bit but gives up pretty quickly. At one time \"sit and \"wait were terribly difficult but he has caught on and will even wait to eat his food when asked. Andy will continue to learn in his foster home from his other fur siblings and foster mom, but will need a home that plans to continue this as he is truly still a pup. \n\nAdoption Fee: $200 - Includes Spay/Neuter, Microchip, and UTD on all vaccines.",

Go to www.smallmiraclesrescue.org and click \"How to Adopt\".  There you will find the dog/puppy application available for download. The more information you provide, the faster the process is for all of us.  Once you are approved to adopt we will schedule an appointment to see the puppy in person and you will be allowed to take it home that day.  Due to the ease of our adoption process, please apply only if you are ready to adopt right now and committed to the level of care that having a puppy requires.  If you are not ready to adopt, we totally understand - just wait to apply until you are ready.  Many of our puppies are placed less than 72 hours after the application is submitted (ex: an application submitted on a Thurs could be approved and the puppy sent home as early as Saturday). \n\nMake sure to note in the email subject line which puppy you are interested in.  I will take back up applications for every puppy in the event an adoption falls through.\n\nAdoption Fee Broken Down:\n\nBefore our puppies are available for adoption, they will always be spayed or neutered, vaccinated (distemper, bordatella, rabies if age appropriate), dewormed, and stool sample checked for parasites.  Adoption fee for our puppies is $325, an additional $30 for a microchip and registration and an additional small discounted amount for a 3 month supply of heartworm preventative, priced at $20.",

He's doing great with my wife and 3 young kids (8, 7, & 4), seems 100% potty trained, emjoys napping in the crate, rides nicely in the car, and walks well on a leash.

She came in as a stray. She is shy at first but she does warm up and love on her humans. She does well with other dogs as long as they are not with her babies. Dakota is not sure what to think about some of the finer things in a dogs' life but she is getting used to them quickly and finding that belly rubs, pets, and soft beds are the way to go. Dakota has not had any accidents in the home. We are unsure how she does with a cat in the home as she only has been exposed to outdoor cats. \n\n \n\nWe are a foster based rescue based out of Muskegon, MI. We have an application process for adopting our pets. We have an application on our website www.caninesrescue.com. PLEASE DO NOT EMAIL US WITH YOUR APPLICATION INFORMATION. WE REQUIRE YOU FILL OUT THE FORM. We check vet references, backgrounds for abuse or neglect and home ownership or speak to the landlord to verify you are allowed to have a pet. Once the application is received and approved then we will set up a time for you to come and meet our pups that are available. All our dogs are up to date on shots, microchipped, been dewormed at least once, and sterilized. All meet and greets are APPOINTMENT ONLY.

Herman does have hip dysplasia and has undergone FHO surgery and has recovered well. Viszla's are sleek dogs and due to the dysplasia he will need to keep his sleek physique. What a great boy!!\n\nDespite the dysplasia Herman does enjoy running around and going for walks. This is not holding our boy back! We hope this doesn't keep you from adopting our handsome boy Herman. \n\nThe adoption fee is $300 and covers age appropriate vaccines, a microchip, and a spay/neuter.\n\n Applications are typically worked in time stamp order based on date/time of submission. If you have other dogs in your home, they must all meet the potential adoptee. It may save you a trip to bring them with you when you visit, if you are certain you want to adopt a new family member. \n\n*****We are currently operating by appointment only during the social distancing stage of quarantine. If you want to meet this pet, or are interested in adopting, please submit an inquiry or email to email@townandcountryhumanesociety.org.\n\nSomeone from the rescue will contact you and/or your family and determine, on a broad level, whether you might be a fit for the animal. If so, they will provide instructions for completing the application. Your application will be reviewed and you will be contacted to set up a time to meet at the shelter or the foster home. The introduction between you and the pet will be supervised by one of the dog counselors or the foster. If all goes well, you can adopt during the same visit.\n\nPlease be sure to follow us on Facebook to learn more about Town and Country Humane Society and our mission.",

I've had a bit of a rough start in life but, thankfully, was rescued by MatchDog. I'm ready to find my forever home! I have something called \"Cherry Eye\", a condition that can be corrected with surgery. Don't worry, though, because MDR is covering this cost. I couldn't be more grateful! You should know that I am crate trained and working hard on my house manners. While I may come across as shy at first, I LOVE to be around people, and I am great with other dogs and children. Humans generally describe me as calm and sweet - an all-around cuddle bug! In fact, once you get to know me, I promise Ill be your biggest F(L)AN:-) If you're looking for some sweet furry caramel custard, fill out an application for me, Flan, today!\n\nIf you think you are a perfect match for Flan please complete an application fully: https://www.petstablished.com/organization/243592\n\nFlan has been fully vetted, is up to date on all vaccinations and on preventatives for heartworm, flea, and tick. We cannot guarantee breed information. You will find price guidelines for adoption at matchdogrescue.org and you can read about the whole adoption process and what MatchDog Rescue provides with each dog\n\nThis gorgeous MatchDog is currently being fostered and cared for at our own facility so as to look and feel his best when he meets you on Saturday February 13, 2021 . For the very best chance of securing a meet with this dog, you must be available all day on this date.\n\n \n\nIf you see a pending notification on this dog, it means we have informed the lucky family selected as the best match for this particular dog and they have agreed to come to the transport/event with the goal of taking the dog to their forever home.

If you are interested in adopting, you MUST come in person during adoption hours and fill out an application.  Adoption hours and address are viewable on the website at www.smallmiraclesrescue.org\n\n\n---FAQ---\n\nIs This Dog Currently Available?... This dog is available at the Small Miracles rescue facility in Ellicott City.  To submit an application, please come meet this dog in person.  You can bring your application with you, or you can fill one out when you come in.  Dogs will be removed from PetFinder only when they have an approved application or more than three (3) interested applicants.\n\nWhere did this dog come from?...  We rescue dogs from 100% kill shelters in West Virginia and on occasion from Kentucky.  On rare occasions we accept owner surrenders.  Due to the nature of the shelters they were rescued from, we often do not know the dogs' history.\n\nHow Old is this dog?...  We look at a dogs' teeth to estimate its age, and then the age is reevaluated by our veterinary staff when the dog is spayed/neutered.  If an age is not posted online, please feel free to inquire.\n\nIs this dog Good With Kids?...  We occasionally know for sure if a dog is good with kids because it came from a home with kids.  This is rare.  We always suggest you bring your children in to meet the dog if you are seriously interested in adopting.  Dogs may like some kids and may dislike others.  Dogs are individuals, just like kids are.\n\nIs this dog Housebroken?...  Advice from a veterinarian:  Even if a dog is housebroken at my house, it does not mean that it understands not to pee at someone else's house.  It ONLY understands not to pee at my house.  Some dogs make the connection that they should only pee outside.  Some must be retrained when they come home.  All we can tell you for sure is whether/or not a dog's crate is clean when we come to walk them in the AM.  All this means is that they are crate trained and waited to pee until we took them outside.\n\nWhat is this dog's Temperament?...  We do not have a clear picture of a dog's temperament until we have allowed them to settle in for a few days.  Even then they are living in a shelter environment with many other dogs and a lot of daily activity.  It can be difficult to say a dog is \"calm\" or \"nervous\" when the shelter environment is playing a big role in that behavior.  We only rescue FRIENDLY dogs who have no known bite history.  If a dog is at Small Miracles, it likes people and has a good temperament.  We always suggest you meet the dog to see if it is the right fit for your lifestyle. \n\nWhat are your Fees?...  Base adoption fee is $325 for adult dogs and puppies.  To this, we add a $30 microchip fee, which we register for you, and a 6 month supply of heartworm preventative.  Heartworm preventative costs $40-60 depending on the weight of the dog.  This means that a large dog will total $405.00 and an extra large dog will total $415.00.\n\nWhy can't I adopt a FREE dog?...  Our adoption fee covers many procedures which cost much more for us then the amount we ask for from you. We spay/neuter all pets, and we give them their first round of vaccines (canine distemper, bordatella, Rabies if age appropriate).  At a typical vet clinic this would cost you $500 at minimum for the surgery, and each vaccine is roughly $35 each.  Even if your adopted dog does not have all of its shots due to the mandatory waiting period between booster shots, we offer vaccinations at the low cost of $20/shot.  We test all dogs for heartworm disease and tickborn illnesses such as Lymes.  We never euthanize a heartworm positive dog, and treatment routinely costs us $3000/dog.  We collect a fecal sample from every rescued dog and run a microscopic parasite test.  Any parasites found will be treated with two rounds of the appropriate dewormer.  We treat all dogs for fleas and ticks with Advantage.  If a dog has significant dental disease or \"very dirty teeth\", we will perform a dental cleaning when the dog has its spay/neuter surgery.  A dental cleaning with extractions would cost you upwards of $400-600 at your local vet clinic.\n\nALSO NOTE... Small Miracle is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization.  We survive off of our adoption fees and donations from the community.  We are a non-profit animal rescue and do not receive income from tax revenue as some county shelters do. \n\nFor more information including Adoption Hours and Rescue Address, please visit our website at www.smallmiraclesrescue.org",

            "description": "weight: \nestimated age: \n\nThis dog recently arrived and is just settling in.  If you are interested in adopting, you MUST come in person during adoption hours and fill out an application.  Adoption hours and address are viewable on the website at www.smallmiraclesrescue.org\n\n\n---FAQ---\n\nIs This Dog Currently Available?... This dog is available at the Small Miracles rescue facility in Ellicott City.  To submit an application, please come meet this dog in person.  You can bring your application with you, or you can fill one out when you come in.  Dogs will be removed from PetFinder only when they have an approved application or more than three (3) interested applicants.\n\nWhere did this dog come from?...  We rescue dogs from 100% kill shelters in West Virginia and on occasion from Kentucky.  On rare occasions we accept owner surrenders.  Due to the nature of the shelters they were rescued from, we often do not know the dogs' history.\n\nHow Old is this dog?...  We look at a dogs' teeth to estimate its age, and then the age is reevaluated by our veterinary staff when the dog is spayed/neutered.  If an age is not posted online, please feel free to inquire.\n\nIs this dog Good With Kids?...  We occasionally know for sure if a dog is good with kids because it came from a home with kids.  This is rare.  We always suggest you bring your children in to meet the dog if you are seriously interested in adopting.  Dogs may like some kids and may dislike others.  Dogs are individuals, just like kids are.\n\nIs this dog Housebroken?...  Advice from a veterinarian:  Even if a dog is housebroken at my house, it does not mean that it understands not to pee at someone else's house.  It ONLY understands not to pee at my house.  Some dogs make the connection that they should only pee outside.  Some must be retrained when they come home.  All we can tell you for sure is whether/or not a dog's crate is clean when we come to walk them in the AM.  All this means is that they are crate trained and waited to pee until we took them outside.\n\nWhat is this dog's Temperament?...  We do not have a clear picture of a dog's temperament until we have allowed them to settle in for a few days.  Even then they are living in a shelter environment with many other dogs and a lot of daily activity.  It can be difficult to say a dog is \"calm\" or \"nervous\" when the shelter environment is playing a big role in that behavior.  We only rescue FRIENDLY dogs who have no known bite history.  If a dog is at Small Miracles, it likes people and has a good temperament.  We always suggest you meet the dog to see if it is the right fit for your lifestyle. \n\nWhat are your Fees?...  Base adoption fee is $325 for adult dogs and puppies.  To this, we add a $30 microchip fee, which we register for you, and a 6 month supply of heartworm preventative.  Heartworm preventative costs $40-60 depending on the weight of the dog.  This means that a large dog will total $405.00 and an extra large dog will total $415.00.\n\nWhy can't I adopt a FREE dog?...  Our adoption fee covers many procedures which cost much more for us then the amount we ask for from you. We spay/neuter all pets, and we give them their first round of vaccines (canine distemper, bordatella, Rabies if age appropriate).  At a typical vet clinic this would cost you $500 at minimum for the surgery, and each vaccine is roughly $35 each.  Even if your adopted dog does not have all of its shots due to the mandatory waiting period between booster shots, we offer vaccinations at the low cost of $20/shot.  We test all dogs for heartworm disease and tickborn illnesses such as Lymes.  We never euthanize a heartworm positive dog, and treatment routinely costs us $3000/dog.  We collect a fecal sample from every rescued dog and run a microscopic parasite test.  Any parasites found will be treated with two rounds of the appropriate dewormer.  We treat all dogs for fleas and ticks with Advantage.  If a dog has significant dental disease or \"very dirty teeth\", we will perform a dental cleaning when the dog has its spay/neuter surgery.  A dental cleaning with extractions would cost you upwards of $400-600 at your local vet clinic.\n\nALSO NOTE... Small Miracle is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization.  We survive off of our adoption fees and donations from the community.  We are a non-profit animal rescue and do not receive income from tax revenue as some county shelters do. \n\nFor more information including Adoption Hours and Rescue Address, please visit our website at www.smallmiraclesrescue.org",

We are no longer answering phone calls and are doing all communications with adopters via email. If you have a dog you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application before sending us emails.

You do not need a new application for every dog that you are interested in adopting. \n\nAt MAMCO we understand that in order to continue rescuing moms and babies, we must stretch our finances as far as we are able.

By assigning higher adoption fees to high demand moms and puppies, we are able to rescue more families in need.The money raised through these adoptions acts as a benefactor to moms and puppies in our care who require expensive veterinary treatments, have behavioral issues, or need more time to find a home. We often reduce the adoption fees on these harder-to-place moms and puppies to help them find forever families. Adoption fees vary, but all include spay or neuter, microchip, up to date vaccinations and deworming, rabies vaccine at the time of spay or neuter, and 30 days of pet insurance.

We are thrilled that so many people want to adopt right now, but we are not equipped to handle the large number of calls, applications, and email inquiries we are receiving. We are no longer answering phone calls and are doing all communications with adopters via email. If you have a dog you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application before sending us emails. When your application has been processed, you will receive an email from us with further instructions on how to adopt. You do not need a new application for every dog that you are interested in adopting. \n\nAt MAMCO we understand that in order to continue rescuing moms and babies, we must stretch our finances as far as we are able. For this reason we use variable adoption pricing. By assigning higher adoption fees to high demand moms and puppies, we are able to rescue more families in need.The money raised through these adoptions acts as a benefactor to moms and puppies in our care who require expensive veterinary treatments, have behavioral issues, or need more time to find a home. We often reduce the adoption fees on these harder-to-place moms and puppies to help them find forever families. Adoption fees vary, but all include spay or neuter, microchip, up to date vaccinations and deworming, rabies vaccine at the time of spay or neuter, and 30 days of pet insurance. We also cover hernia repair and cherry eye repair at the time of spay or neuter. Applications can be filled out at mamcorescue.org.",

            "description": "*Due to concerns surrounding COVID-19, we have reformatted the way that we do adoptions in order to follow social distancing protocols. We are thrilled that so many people want to adopt right now, but we are not equipped to handle the large number of calls, applications, and email inquiries we are receiving. We are no longer answering phone calls and are doing all communications with adopters via email. If you have a dog you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application before sending us emails. When your application has been processed, you will receive an email from us with further instructions on how to adopt. You do not need a new application for every dog that you are interested in adopting. \n\nAt MAMCO we understand that in order to continue rescuing moms and babies, we must stretch our finances as far as we are able. For this reason we use variable adoption pricing. By assigning higher adoption fees to high demand moms and puppies, we are able to rescue more families in need.The money raised through these adoptions acts as a benefactor to moms and puppies in our care who require expensive veterinary treatments, have behavioral issues, or need more time to find a home. We often reduce the adoption fees on these harder-to-place moms and puppies to help them find forever families. Adoption fees vary, but all include spay or neuter, microchip, up to date vaccinations and deworming, rabies vaccine at the time of spay or neuter, and 30 days of pet insurance. We also cover hernia repair and cherry eye repair at the time of spay or neuter. Applications can be filled out at mamcorescue.org.",

            "description": "When Kody joined Rescue Row in the beginning of December, his skin was red, raw and itchy, his feet were swollen, and he had horrible ear infections. He is now ready to find his forever home! This is what his foster mom has to say about him: Kody had an injury to his front leg when he was younger which healed incorrectly, but it doesnt bother him and doesnt stop him from playing! He loves playing with my dogs and would love a doggy sibling in his new home. No small children because he could knock them over with his zoomies. He is house broken, non-destructive, kennels easily with a treat and I only kennel him when I leave the house. He can be shy with strangers at first, walks well on a leash, and he still takes Apoquel every day and gets a medicated bath once a week. He attaches to his person and rarely barks. He is such a sweet guy!\n\nIf you would like to adopt a dog from Rescue Row please fill out an application at https://form.jotform.com/91767055990166 \n\n*Please check your junk email folder if you do not receive a response from a Rescue Row member within 48 hours.\n\n*You must live within an hour of the DFW Metroplex because we do trial adoptions and require a homecheck\n\n*Our adoption fees are as follows (paid by cash or a check made out to Rescue Row):\n\n Dogs 12 weeks-6 months old: $300 adoption fee\n\n Dogs 7 months and older: $275 adoption fee\n\nRescue Row is a 501(c)3 (non-profit) all volunteer dog rescue organization serving the DFW Metroplex. We are dedicated to rescuing dogs in shelters, dogs in abusive or neglectful situations, and dogs surrendered by their owners because of difficult circumstances. We place dogs in loving, responsible, committed permanent homes, following a comprehensive adoption process, which includes taking considerable care in finding good matches and educating prospective adopters about the responsibilities and costs of bringing a dog into their homes and lives. Dogs in our care are spayed or neutered, microchipped, receive all appropriate veterinary care and treatment, and placed in nurturing foster homes while they await placement in their permanent homes. We assist dogs in distress without regard to age, breed or ease of placement. Dogs in the greatest need take priority. Finally, we strive to work with shelters and other rescue and humane organizations to develop a network of supporters and volunteers in order to create a better world for homeless dogs.",

I've come a long way in my time in rescue but I still need a patient home\n- A home with another DOG - I feel more comfortable and confident in the world with another friend and I may even want to play\n- A home with older children - because I am a nervous girl I need a home with a family to give me space and patience to open up\n- A home with plenty of yummy treats! I am a food motivated gal who loves all things food\n- A home with comfy beds and blankets to snooze in\n- A home with a fenced in yard\n\n***Lola Lu needs a very patient home. She was brought into the rescue near feral and very fearful of people and her surroundings. She is not a dog that is going to immediately gravitate to you/ask for attention/snuggle you, and currently she can only be pet on her terms. Given the time and space she needs she will open up, but it will take time! But they do say the best things in life don't come easy \n\n\nBefore emailing- please read:\n- Yes, this dog is available for adoption\n- The adoption fee for Lola Lu is $256\n- Apply at c2cnd.org\n- The adoption fee covers their age appropriate shots, microchip, deworming, spay/neuter, and any other medical expenses while in our care.\n- Local adopters only. Due to our thorough adoption process including home visits, we limit our adoptions to local families in the greater Charlotte area.\n- If you have any additional questions, email us at dogs@c2cnd.org and we will respond as soon as possible!",

TJ is your girl.  TJ is a one year old Terrier mix.  She weighs 16 pounds.  TJ is spayed, heartwood negative and on a preventative, microchipped and current on all vaccinations.\n\nTJ is an active girl who will always be ready for a good romp in the backyard or a couple of miles on the Hike and Bike Trail.  She would be perfect for an active family with older kids.  \n\nTJ needs to be the only dog in the home.  She does not get along with other dogs.  \n\nTJ is making real progress on house training.  She is crate trained.  \n\nAdoption fee $400\n** The Texas Comptroller now requires sales tax on adoption fees.\n\n** Temporarily Suspended due to COVID **\nMonthly Meet & Greets  (12:00 - 2:00)\nPetco (in Leander) every 1st Saturday of the month\nPet Supplies Plus (Parmer & Mopac) every third Saturday of the month\n\n\n** Please note: Due to their size, our dogs are not suitable for homes with children under 5..\n\nWe do not have a facility, all dogs are fostered in the homes of our volunteers. If you are interested in adopting a dog from Lil' Paws Maltese Rescue and other Petite Paws, please visit our website at www.lilpaws-malteserescue.org and fill out an adoption application. This is the first step in our adoption process. Our goal is to place our dogs in safe, stable and loving homes in the Austin Metropolitan area. Thanks for looking!\n\nLil' Paws Maltese Rescue and other Petite Paws depends on donations to keep the dogs in our program healthy. Many health issues are taken care of before a dog leaves a rescue: spaying, neutering, immunizations, dental care, and in some cases major surgery. Because of the cost of this care, donations are essential to enable us to continue our work. If you would like to show appreciation for what we do and help us continue to do it please go to our website homepage and click the donate button. We thank you in advance for your support.",

            "description": "Sweet Nikki falls in love with everyone she meets and with her great demeanor she will steal your heart.  Nikki is a one-year-old 30-ish pound hound mix, energetic and playful.  She loves to \"herd\" the resident foster dog in the home so she would love another canine companion so she can hone her skills!  A fenced yard will be ideal for her.   Nike is a little \"mouthy\" when she plays so older kids would be best.  She does not bite nor is she \"barky\" \nNikki is heartworm positive and we will have her treated in 30 days.  We do not want to hold up her adoption and so for that reason we'd like a home for her in south Jersey so she can be treated by her favorite vet next month.  As you may know, heartworm is not contagious but will require some quiet time after treatment.  \nNikki is housetrained, crate-trained, spayed and up to date with vaccinations.  She will make a great companion in any loving home where she can get her exercise in a fenced yard and take great walks with her person.   She's a love!\nApplications at www.pounddogfounddog at the top of the homepage.",

We were able to get him oral surgery and he got to keep 4 teeth and is feeling SO much better. His bloodwork was really good for a dog his age...Max says age is just a number anyway because he loves to romp and easily makes friends with everyone. He is around 9 lbs and 13 years old. He is housebroken, leash trained and does ok in a crate and also has very nice house manners. He does have some separation anxiety so would do best with someone home most of the time or able to take him along on their adventures. Max is ready to find his new forever family!",

            "description": "Meet Tory!\n\nThis handsome devil is an English Coonhound X Beagle. He's a chunky 5 year old dude, weighing in at about 55 pounds.\n\nSadly, Tory's owner surrendered him to the shelter due to a life threatening medical condition that prevented him from providing proper care. Tory has always known love. This is clear from his happy greeting of all people both young and old. He seems most happy in the company of younger people. He can be a little jumpy so caution around toddlers and younger should be used.\n\nTory had very little training when he came into our rescue. His leash manners needed a lot of work. He likely had not been walked on leash much before. Tory has been working very hard on his leash manners and has made great progress. His forever family will need to be realistic and committed to continued training in this regard. Tory is not the dog your small child will be able to walk.\n\nTory is housetrained and loves his crate. He sleeps the night away in his crate without fuss. Tory does show some resource guarding of his food bowl. For this reason he is fed in his crate. This gives him the security to know he can eat his food peacefully. It was very evident to Foster Mom that Tory may have been fed table scraps exclusively in his previous home. He is now on kibble and doing great. A strict feeding schedule with high value treats reserved only for training will be important in keeping his weight controlled.\n\nA home with another chill and low key dog would be fine with Tory, although we suspect his happy place is as an only dog. Tory really has no interest in playing with another dog. Tory is said to have lived compatibly with cats in his previous home.\n\nTory LOVES to engage with people and is very vocal in his want for attention. He loves to sit on your lap and have his chest rubbed. Tory doesn't bark at the doorbell or visitors to the home. He is very vocal when he's telling you stories of his day though.\n\nA Hound that thrives on reliable structure and a strong leader, Tory is going to do best in a home with a confident and experienced family. Tory is not a suitable \"first time\" dog. Having a dog in your family home when you grew up doesn't count as dog experience (sorry...)\n\nTory will require a fully fenced yard. We will not consider apartments or condo's for any reason.\n\nTory is located in Guelph, Ontario. We will be considering applications from Ontario and Quebec only at this time. Transport can be arranged.\n\nIf you are interested in chatting with our team, the first step is to complete our online application. https://www.coonhoundrescue.ca/adoption-application\n\nPlease Note:\n\nWe are all volunteers and busy taking care of our foster dogs so please take the time to fill out our on-line adoption application if you are interested in more information about any of the hounds that we have for adoption. Filling out our application does not obligate you to adopt in any way. It does, however, help us to determine if the dog that your interested in would be a good match for your family and lifestyle.\n\nAll of our dogs are fully vetted. They have been vaccinated, altered, microchipped and heartworm tested and on prevention.\n\nVISIT COONHOUND COMPANIONS WEBSITE TO SEE WHY ADOPTING A COONHOUND CAN BE A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE!\n\nwww.coonhoundcompanions.com\n\nADOPTION FEE: $450.00\n\nLOCATION: Tory is currently in foster care in Guelph, ON. With the help of volunteers, transportation to his forever home can possibly be arranged. Don't let distance deter you!\n\nIf you would like to give this handsome boy a forever home please fill out our on line adoption application at\n\nwww.coonhoundrescue.ca/adoption-application",

            "description": ",Due to COVID-19, all adoptions will be by appointment only. To adopt, complete our online adoption application and an Adoption Counselor will contact you within 48-hours to schedule your adoption appointment. Adoptions for any pets in foster will be completed offsite at our PetSmart Claiborne location on a case by case basis. The safety of our foster parents and community is of utmost importance to us and it will be at the foster's discretion if they'd like to meet at this time. Thank you for choosing adoption! \n\nThis active dog walks nicely on leash and loves to go for walks.  He has some interest in toys but mainly just wants to hang with his human.  He enjoys attention and is looking forward to meeting you.\n\nTo inquire about an adoptable animal from the Louisiana SPCA, please call 504.368.5191, ext. 150 to speak with an adoption counselor.\nTo see more adoptable animals from the Louisiana SPCA, please go to http://la-spca.org/adopt.\n\n\n\nThe petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n",

Fill out an application here to get the ball rolling...\nhttps://pethavenmn.org/adopt/adoptable-dogs/dog-adoption-application/\n\nHere is more about Nellie!\n\nNellie is a loving and playful one-year-old, 60-pound Lab / Retriever mix. She is house-trained, does best with routine, and is still working on letting her human know when she needs to go outside. Nellie is also crate-trained but she is vocal when she is in there. When her foster dad is out, she has been okay left to roam the house along with her foster brother without issue.\n\nNellie has done well with children she has met, has not had exposure to cats, and with slow introductions she is coexisting with the resident dog in her foster home. She is leash reactive and does not yet recognize social cues and ends up jumping up and pestering other dogs trying to get them to play to the point where she will need to be separated. She is working on this in her foster home, and a forever home that will continue this training is important.\n\nNellie is a total sweetheart with her human and loves to climb up and be a lap dog, get belly rubs, play fetch for as long as you are willing, and go for long walks. She'll need a calm, patient human who can provide redirection and positive reinforcement for good behavior as she's shown a tendency for demand barking when she wants to play. A tall, fenced yard would be ideal for Nellie as she loves to run around and let out some energy! She has not shown interest in jumping the fence; however, she has shown a propensity to try to push the gates open and escape.\n\nNellie lives an active lifestyle and would love someone who will take her hiking or on long walks. She really will need to have a single-family home and yard to play in. It is likely she will warm up to other resident dogs eventually and would love someone who will be patient with her as she learns to socialize better, but as a constant cuddler, she would love to be an only dog and the center of attention!\n\n\n\nHer adoption fee includes spay/neuter, heartworm/Lyme test, all age-appropriate vaccinations (distemper, rabies, & Bordetella), HW and flea/tick preventative, and microchip implant and registration. \n\nThere is no guarantee of age and breed as a rescue animal's history is unknown. All ages and breeds are best guess.\n\nAdoption fees INCLUDE a mandatory sales tax of 7.525%.\n\nDue to post-adoption services provided, it is Pet Haven's policy to only place dogs into homes within a 75-mile radius of the Minneapolis, MN city center.\n\n",

            "description": "Pepper Joe goes by Hank now... If you are an active person who is looking for a devoted dog with a big streak of sweetness, Hank is your guy. He wants nothing more than to spend time with the person or people he loves: taking hikes, chasing the ball, going on runs and leash walks. He bonds deeply-as herding dogs will do-and is a fine mashup of Border Collie smarts and cartoon goofiness (just watch him sleep with his head half off his dog bed and his legs in the air). \n\nHe is big energy and wants an active person or small family to help him spend that energy. But Hank also has a fine capacity for being chill: for curling up nearby while you work or read or watch TV. He loves road trips. He loves just hanging out. He doesn't seem to favor a certain type of person. In the past, Hank has bonded with an 11-year-old boy (inseparable), a 57-year-old woman (smitten), and a 30-something couple (double love). Though he is fine with small children when he's outdoors, Hank is NOT recommended for a home with small children. Hank is house trained and good with other dogs. He needs to be reminded firmly not to chase/herd cats. Our house cat is not fazed by him and often crowds Hank out of his own dog bed. \n\nNot every home is a good fit for Hank. He was rescued as an adult and has a particular area where he needs loving guidance. When he is inside his home, Hank can be anxious around people he doesn't know, or people who come around the people he loves, including other family members. Hank shows this anxiety with a groaning vocalization-we call it \"the creaky door sound-and sometimes he adds Border Collie herding moves around the person of concern. If the behavior is not interrupted and redirected, it can escalate to barking and nipping. He doesn't do this with everyone. We've been working with a trainer to teach Hank to redirect and change this behavior and he has made very good progress at his foster home (two adults and a teenager). Hank is smart and he wants to learn. A house with a lot of visitors (say, with a home business or daycare) would not be a good fit. A house with small children would also not be a good fit.\n\nIf you can give Hank some patient training along with a kind, stable home, he will reward you. He will be about the most devoted, joyous dog you can imagine. When he sees the person he loves, Hank wags his tail so hard he nearly falls over. When he falls in love, he falls hard. A home on the quiet side and a smaller family-or even a single person-is recommended for Hank.",

            "description": ",Due to COVID-19, all adoptions will be by appointment only. To adopt, complete our online adoption application and an Adoption Counselor will contact you within 48-hours to schedule your adoption appointment. Adoptions for any pets in foster will be completed offsite at our PetSmart Claiborne location on a case by case basis. The safety of our foster parents and community is of utmost importance to us and it will be at the foster's discretion if they'd like to meet at this time. Thank you for choosing adoption! \n\nThis big goofy energetic guy is in need of a loving home.  He is well mannered and affectionate.  He is the kind of guy who needs to be active.  He really loves playing outside and going for long walks.  He is easy going and a happy guy.  Now all he needs is a human he can call his own.\n\nTo inquire about an adoptable animal from the Louisiana SPCA, please call 504.368.5191, ext. 150 to speak with an adoption counselor.\nTo see more adoptable animals from the Louisiana SPCA, please go to http://la-spca.org/adopt.\n\n\n\nThe petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n",

Just copy and paste the link below into your browser (or simply type it in) and then search for the dog's \"gallery\" by name\n\n          http://adoptasleddog.smugmug.com\n\nVIDEOS:  In addition to photo albums, almost every dog has a video which will give you a much better \"feel\" for his or her personality.  NOTE:  In the new Petfinder format, it has become quite a bit more difficult to find and to play videos.  Please PAGE THROUGH the photos, looking for a photo overlaid in the center with a \"play\" arrow inside a circle.  This icon is white, so it can be difficult to see. \n In many (most) cases, the video is the last photo displayed as you page through.  Just click on that photo and it will play.  Please make sure you CHECK ON THE PETFINDER VIDEO ICON, above, to see a video of this wonderful dog!  Our videos will include, at a minimum, whatever info we had on the dog upon (or shortly after) his/her arrival into our program.  There will sometimes be video updates as well.  And in every case, our Adoptions Coordinator can be emailed at ADOPTASLEDDOG@AOL.COM to answer questions and provide the most current information we have on the dog.  \n\nNOTES:  Please see video or contact our Adoptions Coordinator at ADOPTASLEDDOG@AOL.COM.\n\nADOPTION DONATION:  $250  Before adoption, all Northern Lights dogs (regardless of whether Petfinder's symbols appear) are spayed or neutered, microchipped, heartworm negative, fully vaccinated and tested/treated for known parasites.\n \nWHAT TO DO IF YOU WANT TO ADOPT THIS DOG:  Email us at ADOPTASLEDDOG@AOL.COM to request an application and get started.  WE DO NOT HAVE AN ONLINE APPLICATION - you will have to request one via email.  We will review your application to determine if there is a good fit between you and/or your family and this dog.  We may suggest another dog or dog(s) if we can offer a better fit in terms of lifestyle, experience, other pets, etc.  A vet check, reference checks, and a home visit will be conducted before an adoption can be considered for approval.  \n \nNORTHERN LIGHTS DOES NOT HAVE A PHYSICAL SHELTER.  We are a nonprofit rescue organization comprised of individuals who open their private homes to foster dogs in need of a second chance..  When fosters are not available, we often pay to board a dog until space is available.  New fosters and donations to pay for boarding are always desperately needed us.  Email us at KATYLIED2@AOL.COM if you are interested in donating or for information on fostering.\n \nFAQ:  For information regarding our organization, as well as adoption policies and practices, please visit our Petfinder Home Page at WWW.NORTHERNLIGHTS.PETFINDER.COM.\n \n \nNOTICE:  In the vast majority of cases, the dogs in our program and rescued from shelters, and Northern Lights has no means by which to collect or verify a dog's history.  We work in concert with our veterinarians, and breed and age estimates are based on a combination of professional input and our collective experience.  Our policy with information acquired prior to acceptance and while the dogs are in our care is that of \"full disclosure\".  It is our goal to ensure the adopter has all available information to ensure the best possible match between the dog and the adopter(s).  If we have identified a behavioral or health condition while the dog is in our care and custody, every effort will be made to correct it prior to adoption, OR the adopter will be made aware of the issue or condition prior to adoption.  Northern Lights' screening process is designed to identify only those adopters who are willing, and have the means, to treat conditions which may occur after adoption, and the adopter will be contractually responsible for doing so. However, Northern Lights' policy is to accept any adopted dog back into the program, at any time, for any reason.\n",
