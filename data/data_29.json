            "description": "Autumn! She is a beautiful and sweet Doberman, we guess her to be 1-2 years old and she is around 65 lbs. She is a medium/high energy dog that needs regular exercise.\n\nPlease read all about Autumn (below) and if you feel you are a good match for her and want to meet her, please complete an application found on our website, we will be adopting Autumn into the Portland area only.\nwww.mywayhomedogrescue.org\n\nThis sweet girl is smart, sweet, playful, alert, excitable, and a true velcro dog that wants to be by you. She does pretty well on leash, she is crate trained (not a fan but will crate-up) and house trained (when offered to go outside often). \n\nThis sweet girl had a surprise when she came into our rescue and one sweet puppy was born a couple weeks after arriving to Oregon. Her puppy has been weaned, is adopted and now it is Autumn\u2019s turn. \n\nAutumn has a head tilt that is more noticeable when she is nervous and nearly imperceptible when she is relaxed. She does not seem to exhibit any neurological concerns and there do not appear to be any major medical concerns, but she may have a lifelong tendency to tilt her head (which only adds to her sweet and silly disposition).\n\nAutumn\u2019s ideal home has a securely fenced yard, people who are home most of the time, provides lots of belly rubs, occasional peanut butter, a comfy bed (or her preference your bed or couch), regular exercise, and play time with squeaky toys and bones. Autumn will do best with a dog to hang with, a dog that is confident and calm with good behaviors for her to follow. Her favorite game with her dog friends is chase!\n\nAutumn is still young and has been through quite a bit, though she still remains sweet and loving. She will benefit from a dog experienced home willing to continue her training. She has high prey drive so no cats for her! She loves to jump so no children.\n\nAutumn has had her vaccinations, heart wormed tested, has been spayed, de-wormed, had flea treatment, and is microchipped. Her adoption fee is $350.",

He is a big handsome fella, about two years old, actually fawn and white, around 80 lbs, needs leash work, wants to be a big lap baby. Good with his female dog kennel partner but NOT male dogs.\nDOG ADOPTION FEE is $100. This Adoption fee includes: mandatory spay/neuter which will be done before you can take your dog or puppy home with you; basic canine immunizations (DHPP-CPV & Bordatella Intranasal); de-wormings; one-year rabies vaccination if old enough; heartworm test if over five months old; microchip from 24-Pet Watch; certificate for free health examination at your participating veterinarian; and a goodie bag chocked full of information, toys, and more. (If a dog is sponsored or has a waived or lower fee, that info will be provided at the point of adoption to the approved adopter).\nThe first step is to our Adoption Application here: https://elmorehumane.org/adoption-application-online-form2.html .\nIMPORTANT - we respond to your emailed applications and queries via email back to you.

            "description": "Meet handsome Jasper, just a pup at 4-5 months old and 30 lbs. He is so cute! He is the coolest mix of 5 breeds! 33% staffordshire terrier, 29% labrador, 27% australian cattle dog, 8% chihuahua!, and 3% miniature american shepherd.\n\nHe is a kind boy and young enough to have the exact right start in life, with training being number one on the list - for him and for you!\n\nJasper likes dogs and cats, but kids make him really nervous, so a sans-child home will do him well. Another dog in the home will give him confidence. Being an only dog will not help him thrive.\n\nHe is smart, knows how to leash walk, learning commands. He loves to go hiking, too.\n\nJasper is shy at first, not quite sure of his place in the world. After he warms up he is ok. He startles easily as well.\n\nWe will want to work with him on meeting strangers as it makes him nervous. We have great tools that his foster mom is practicing and will be passed on to you.\n\nHe is so sweet, loves his toys, loves to play, and run around in the yard. He is prone to jumping up to say hi and that is being worked on. He loves to cuddle, loves it!\n\nHe is now updated on all shots, neutered, and will be chipped. His adoption fee is $495.\n\nWe cover the medical to prepare the pet for adoption and the adopt donations go directly to cover those costs and range from $295-$495. Thank you for stepping up to save a life!\n\nTo expedite to meet with this dog, please go to our site at www.savinggreatanimals.org and fill out an application. We look at the first applications to arrive, so we hope to hear from you soon!",

            "description": "These sweet babies were picked up this weekend. They were found dumped and poor little Peavey was injured. Peavey\u2019s leg was swollen and he couldn\u2019t use it. Thankfully, we had a foster step up and were able to get them seen and Peavey is now healing great and using his leg. We are unsure if their mix. Probably some lab in there. Maybe some terrier. They will be medium sized as adults we believe. They are 6-8 weeks and around 5lbs. They are super sweet and playful. Great with all animals and people. They truly are great for pretty much any family. They will be ready for adoption on 2/10 after their second vaccines and they are altered. \n\nAll dogs have a $175 adoption fee which includes vet check, age appropriate shots (atleast 2 sets for puppies), dewormer, heartworm test (if over 6 months), rabies (if atleast 16 weeks) and spay/neuter! Puppies will be altered before adoption. All rescues and shelters practice pediatric spay and neuter. This is essential in our rescue efforts and it is a policy that we will stick by. All dogs over 8 weeks and 2 pounds will be altered before adoption. There are no exceptions to this rule on all healthy and adoptable dogs. \n\nPuppies/Dogs that are not available for adoption due to vetting not being complete can be reserved with an approved application and a non refundable $50 deposit. This deposit is applied to your adoption fee and the remaining $125 is due at pick up.\n\nWags and Whiskers is an all-volunteer rescue. We also have full-time jobs and Families. We will try to answer all questions and applications in a timely manner. Please be patient and bear with us . Do not contact Parkway Animal Hospital as they are a vet clinic and can not answer questions on behalf of Wags and Whiskers. All questions and comments must go directly through the rescue. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nFOSTER APPLICATION\n\nhttps://form.jotform.us/71694695237167\n\nFOSTER TO ADOPT APPLICATION\n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/91243748615158",

He has a fluffy black and tan coat and is super soft and cuddly.  Stubby is quite unusual looking with his short stocky legs.  He\u2019s what you call a \u201clow-rider\u201d.  At five months old, he weighs thirty pounds and will be a medium sized dog when full grown.  Stubby is very affectionate and loves to give kisses.  This boy will make a fabulous family pet for anyone with time to train a puppy.  He is working on his house manners and will need a fenced in yard.  Stubby is a loving playful pup and wonderful with children.  He has quite the toy collection and doesn\u2019t mind sharing.  He\u2019s great with other dogs and would love to have a playmate.  Stubby is an affectionate puppy that will make a wonderful addition to your family.  Get your application in quickly because this pup is sure to be popular.  \n\nTo adopt this pet, Click \"More About Us\" and then \"Adoption Application\" to be directed to our online HSNWGA application form.

            "description": "These sweet babies were picked up this weekend. They were found dumped and poor little Peavey was injured. Peavey\u2019s leg was swollen and he couldn\u2019t use it. Thankfully, we had a foster step up and were able to get them seen and Peavey is now healing great and using his leg. We are unsure if their mix. Probably some lab in there. Maybe some terrier. They will be medium sized as adults we believe. They are 6-8 weeks and around 5lbs. They are super sweet and playful. Great with all animals and people. They truly are great for pretty much any family. They will be ready for adoption on 2/10 after their second vaccines and they are altered. \n\nAll dogs have a $175 adoption fee which includes vet check, age appropriate shots (atleast 2 sets for puppies), dewormer, heartworm test (if over 6 months), rabies (if atleast 16 weeks) and spay/neuter! Puppies will be altered before adoption. All rescues and shelters practice pediatric spay and neuter. This is essential in our rescue efforts and it is a policy that we will stick by. All dogs over 8 weeks and 2 pounds will be altered before adoption. There are no exceptions to this rule on all healthy and adoptable dogs. \n\nPuppies/Dogs that are not available for adoption due to vetting not being complete can be reserved with an approved application and a non refundable $50 deposit. This deposit is applied to your adoption fee and the remaining $125 is due at pick up.\n\nWags and Whiskers is an all-volunteer rescue. We also have full-time jobs and Families. We will try to answer all questions and applications in a timely manner. Please be patient and bear with us . Do not contact Parkway Animal Hospital as they are a vet clinic and can not answer questions on behalf of Wags and Whiskers. All questions and comments must go directly through the rescue. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nFOSTER APPLICATION\n\nhttps://form.jotform.us/71694695237167\n\nFOSTER TO ADOPT APPLICATION\n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/91243748615158",

I'm still a puppy so still working on my crate and house training, but I learn quickly and am eager to please. My foster mama takes me to work with her and I do so well there as long as I have a few toys and chewies to keep me busy. I love other dogs and would really love to live with a doggie friend! I'm also very friendly and outgoing with people! I'm looking for a person/family who is home a lot and will continue my training and socialization with lots of love and consistency- I promise to be the best boy! \n\nDue to the current events, the rescue is not able to host adoption events.  Please fill out an application and we will conduct phone interviews and set up outdoor meet and greets! www.thegooddogrescue.org\n\nMy adoption fee is $300 and I am neutered, microchipped and up to date on vaccinations",

He's ready for an active person to swoop in and adopt him. He is equal part sweetness and energy. \n\nAce enjoys long walks and even likes rainy days. He will sometime bring his tennis ball or squeaky toy along on his walks and just strut along. Playing ball is one of his favorite past times. \n\nAce does well on leash but if he sees a bird or squirrel he gets super excited. We feel Ace could use some basic leash training along with furthering his response to sit, stay, down and wait. He's very treat and toy motivated so that makes training easier.\n\nAce loves other dogs and is happy and wiggly with children. He likes them so much and he jumps when excited so he'd do best with children 8 and older. \n\nIf you're interested in Ace click \"Ask About Ace\". This will generate an email inquiry to us and we'll respond back.",

            "description": "These beauties were found dumped over the weekend. Thankfully, a Good Samaritan picked them up and held them until they could get to our vet today. We honestly have no idea on breed but based on their looks we would guess Shepherd/Mastiff mix and they should be fairly large. They are around 6 weeks. They are the sweetest babies. Developing little personalities and getting more comfortable everyday! They are playful and very loving. They will be ready for full adoption on 2/10 after their second round of vaccines and they are altered! \n\nAll dogs have a $175 adoption fee which includes vet check, age appropriate shots (atleast 2 sets for puppies), dewormer, heartworm test (if over 6 months), rabies (if atleast 16 weeks) and spay/neuter! Puppies will be altered before adoption. All rescues and shelters practice pediatric spay and neuter. This is essential in our rescue efforts and it is a policy that we will stick by. All dogs over 8 weeks and 2 pounds will be altered before adoption. There are no exceptions to this rule on all healthy and adoptable dogs. \n\nPuppies/Dogs that are not available for adoption due to vetting not being complete can be reserved with an approved application and a non refundable $50 deposit. This deposit is applied to your adoption fee and the remaining $125 is due at pick up.\n\nWags and Whiskers is an all-volunteer rescue. We also have full-time jobs and Families. We will try to answer all questions and applications in a timely manner. Please be patient and bear with us . Do not contact Parkway Animal Hospital as they are a vet clinic and can not answer questions on behalf of Wags and Whiskers. All questions and comments must go directly through the rescue. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION\n\nhttps://form.jotform.us/70898112177159",

If you have a question or inquiry please email us at tlrapplications@gmail.com\nThey say a picture is worth a thousand words.... well, a thousand more have been shouted.Misty was surrendered (yes, she had a 'home') in this condition. On a Friday. Less than 2 hours before animal control closed. Can you imagine how itchy she is? How painful it is to have your nails growing into the pads of her paws?Can you imagine at 10 years old being dumped at animal control???Why? Probably because she couldn't stop itching.... you know what would have stopped this? A simple pill. Once a month. What $10/ month??We immediately sprung Misty from the shelter amd she is currently receiving vet care at our partner ani.al hospital. She is already feeling SOO much better!!! ( see before/after pics)\n\nOnce she's clear for travel, Misty will travel north to her waiting foster in NJ who is our 'senior home' for our elderly rescues.\nOnce we evaluate her specific needs we will consider her availability for adoption.\nStay tuned.",

She has great house manners and is NOT destructive. She is house trained, crate trained and an all around wonderful dog. Ellie DOES need a home with no young children, they scare her. She is well socialized with other dogs and loves to play. She also enjoys doggy daycare!\n\nHer energy level is just right. She's happy to go for a walk OR snuggle on the couch with her people. She walks well on leash with her harness. Did I mention she's a great snuggler?!! She also loves to chase her tail and then gets a spurt of the zoomies!\n\nEllie warms up to women faster than men. She can be timid around men and new people she doesn't know.\n\nIf you'd like to hear more about Ellie, please reach out to granitestatepaw@gmail.com",

She is great in the house, she has herding behavior which is very quiet and soft, she never barks, she gets along with all of the other dogs, no issues whatsoever!  How can this dog be homeless?!  lady has a bobbed tail and the most beautiful masked face.  She has great recall and great manners.  She loves nothing more than a wide open field to run in big circles and try to get someone to chase her.  This heeler is such a smart girl, easy to love and ready to find her forever home.  She will let you know she is ready for playtime by nibbling on your toes !  Text us or call at 812-267-2814 and let us send you our adoption application.\n\nOur adoption fee is a $180 non-refundable donation which includes:\n\nSpay/Neuter\nRabies Vaccination\n\n6-Way Vaccination\nHeartworm Testing and Treatment if necessary\nWorming \nSocialization with other dogs \nHistory of Origin of your new pet, complete medical history and veterinary contacts\nDedicated support after Adoption\nLifelong Safety Net for your Pet\nTips for your individual dog for a successful adoption and transition\n   \nWe do not adopt out any dog as housebroken. Housebreaking your new pet is an important part of the bonding process and is a necessary commitment for a successful transition. Those first few weeks in your  home are when your new dog learns to trust and respect you, as his person. When adopting make sure you have thought out a potty training routine ahead of time, before bringing a new dog into your home.   We do reserve the right to inspect the home to ensure there will not be any conflicts or issues that could result in an unsuccessful introduction to the family.  In addition you may rest assured that every dog  offered to the public for adoption by All American Dawgs has been handled and under direct guidance of our personnel for no less than 30 days.  This time period is necessary to assess each pet, individually, for health issues and individual behavior  before they go to new homes.  Each and every dog, during this period, will get regular exercise via pack walks through the countryside and regular direction in  basic manners while  learning extremely necessary socialization skills.  Our goal is to bridge committed adopters to good minded companions and this is accomplished by helping rescue dogs learn the basic skills necessary for that next step, your family. \n\nAdopters must meet and spend time with their newly adopted dog via a scheduled Meet and Greet here at All American Dawgs in Rockport, Indiana.  We do not ship our dogs under any circumstances as they are members of our family and their safety is    Priority # 1.\n\nPlease visit our FaceBook site at https://www.facebook.com/AADawgs for even more albums and information of our adoptable dogs.  Give us a like and enjoy the updates of our friends and adopters.  The happiness and satisfaction of our adopters is of utmost importance as our adoptive families become part of the A. A. D. family.\n\nIf you see a dog that you would like to get to know a little better please email us at: \nAllAmericanDawgs@gmail.com or call at 812-267-2814 to receive an adoption\napplication to complete.  Once the application has been processed by All American Dawgs (usually within 24-48 hours) we will call you to set up a meet and greet day that is most convenient to your family.\n\nAnyone that wishes to meet a particular dog must complete our application process first.  We do not have an open to the public facility and the best way to reach us is via email  at  AllAmericanDawgs@gmail. com or text at 812-267-2814.  Please also enjoy additional pictures under photos on our FaceBook site  https://www.facebook.com/AADawgs",

Most importantly, I'm a BIG snuggle bug! In the shelter, I can be a little nervous when meeting new people, but once I know you, I LOVE you! I would benefit MOST from a home with no children or other pets and owners with patience so that I can show you my sweet personality. If I sound like a good fit for your family, you can submit your application, then call the shelter at 609-265-5073 to schedule an appointment to fall in love with me! I promise you will!",

He's a big teddy bear that loves to cuddle on the couch, and sleeping with you in bed would be even better if you ask his opinion! He is a medium to low energy dog who mostly wants to hang out with his person. Sampson loves dogs of all sizes and will need another confident dog in the house to help him adjust in his new home. Sampson is also good with cats. Young kids make him nervous so a home with kids over the age of 12 is a must. Sampson is crate trained, housebroken and eager to find a family to love. \n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $350 which includes routine vetting and spay/neuter. \n\nFor more information, please contact khasse@petconnectrescue.org\n\n**If you're viewing this on Petfinder, please visit www.petconnectrescue.org to complete our non-binding application.**",

Dylan was rescued from a rural shelter where he broke with parvo.  He was treated and is now happy and healthy.  \n\nDylan is a very sweet and goofy boy.  He loves attention from his people and would be happy to follow them around and lay near them.  He is a pretty happy go lucky boy who is just a total sweetheart.  Dylan lives with other dogs and does well with them.  \n\nDylan would like a home where he is treated like a member of the family.  He just wants a home where they can spend a lot of time with him.  I am sure he would love an active family to keep him busy but also want to lay around the house with him.  \n\nDylan is working on house training.  He does pretty well using potty pads for the time being and knows to potty when he goes outside but he is just too young to fully hold his bladder so he will need continued training and patience.   \n\nDylan is neutered, microchipped, and current on his vaccines.  His adoption fee is $175.\n\nIf you would like to adopt Dylan and make him a part of your family, please contact ForeverYoursOKC@gmail.com.",

Please go to www.theshelterconnection.com or to the shelter page on Petfinder for more information about and directions to the shelter.\nVanessa is a beautiful  3 year old husky mix that was pulled by us from an overcrowded shelter in Georgia. Because she is heartworm positive, a common mosquito borne illness in the south, her chances of being adopted were slim. Heartworm is curable, but can be a lengthy process. Rather than have her reside at the shelter for the entire duration of the treatment, we are seeking an adoptive family that will work with us on keeping up with her treatment. The Shelter Connection\u2019s Mend-A-Paw fund will fully cover the cost of all heartworm related treatments, but any adoptive family must be willing and able to bring her either here or to our vet of choice for heartworm appointments. Vanessa will also require low activity throughout the duration of the treatment.\nVanessa is a sweet, medium energy girl that lives for belly rubs, but is cautious when meeting new people at first. She would do best in a dog experienced home without young children. Because of Vanessa\u2019s medical condition we are seeking a family for her through an application process. If you would like to submit an application for Vanessa, please email us at animalshelter@northhempsteadny.gov\n",

Don't get me wrong, we will have a lot of fun in the meantime but I will need time to understand what's expected of me. I will need help on all those fun puppy things like house training and basic obedience. I want to learn everything I possibly can. I am pretty excited about life and doing new things! My goal is to be your lifelong companion and I should learn quickly with praise, treats and little patience. I'd really love for us to get enrolled in training classes, after all school is the best way to get us both educated on what it takes to raise a puppy! It will be fun to watch me as I'm learning, after all puppies can be pretty silly. If you're ready to take on all the fun and companionship, come on out to Wayside Waifs today!\n ...",

Apply KenMarRescue.org\n\nFAVORITE FOOD: What you\u2019re eating \nFAVORITE PASTTIME: Sunbathing\nPET PEEVE: Wind\n\nI\u2019m Lola! \n\nMy parent died and left no provisions in their trust for me or my canine siblings. \n\nSo my owner\u2019s HUMAN (not humane) DAUGHTER decided to dump all of us at a shelter and call it a day. \n\nYep, she couldn\u2019t be done with us soon enough, her dead parent\u2019s fur-kids.\n\nI am not housebroken to your floorplan.\n\nI am not a circus dog that knows tricks.\n\nSo don\u2019t bother to ask.\n\nI am a little girl, alone.\n\nDepending on the kindness of strangers.\n\nI went from one day sleeping inside a warm home to the next sleeping outside in a kennel with other dogs on the cement floor.\n\nI wonder how you would survive.\n\nIf you have a large space in your heart and a small place in your home to give me the PATIENCE I am going to need to get over this trauma, I welcome you in my heart.\n\nIf you are new to pet parenting, I am not the dog for you.\n\nIf you have toddlers or smaller aged kids, don\u2019t apply.\n\nIf your kids are mean, ditto.\n\nI have been spayed recently so cannot undergo anesthesia again (it would be hard on my heart) for at least 6-12 months. I am in need of a dental cleaning, just so you know.\n\nMy \u201ccherry eye,\u201d doesn\u2019t bother me but if it bothers you, you may want to have your vet look at it and tuck it in once you adopt me.\n\nI am here on this match site to find a forever family that is willing to commit to me for all of my life.\n\nXo,\nLola\n\n***\n\nI love people; especially ones that give me massages, real steak or hamburger pieces as treats, and people that let me snooze in the sun. I have a favorite spot, right behind my ears, that I like to get rubbed. When that happens, I make a funny sound, because it feels so good! I get along with the dogs and people I have met at my foster parents\u2019 house. They don\u2019t have small children or cats which suits me fine since I am more inclined to want to be around adults anyway.  What can I say, I love the one on one attention! I enjoy car rides, new adventures & playing. I need a house full of soft beds, snuggles, and yummy treats.\n\nIf you can give me a home with a secured yard, playtime with you, keep my mind stimulated by teaching me new things and incorporating me into your daily routine, including two walks a day, then you can give me a miracle.\n\nAdults only HOMEOWNERS preferred (gentle older teens ok) with secured yard in the So Cal area please. \n\nPlease apply online at KenMarRescue.org\n\nYou too can help save a dog's life!\nCan\u2019t adopt? Want to help? Sponsor me!\n- A small amount can mean the difference between a vaccine and a microchip.\n- A larger amount could provide sterilization to \"one more\" needy orphan or help us bail him or her out before being put to sleep.\n- An even larger donation could cover the food and medical for one or more orphans for an entire year or help cover the vet expenses on expensive surgeries for \"special needs\" orphans suffering from neglect, cruelty or accidental injury.\n\nYou can make a donation to Ken-Mar Rescue through Paypal, its safe, secure and easy. All donations are tax deductible and 100% of your donation goes directly towards the care of animals in need.

She is a very sweet girl, loves tummy rubs and stuffed toys. NOT good with cats though.\nDOG ADOPTION FEE is $100. This Adoption fee includes: mandatory spay/neuter which will be done before you can take your dog or puppy home with you; basic canine immunizations (DHPP-CPV & Bordatella Intranasal); de-wormings; one-year rabies vaccination if old enough; heartworm test if over five months old; microchip from 24-Pet Watch; certificate for free health examination at your participating veterinarian; and a goodie bag chocked full of information, toys, and more. (If a dog is sponsored or has a waived or lower fee, that info will be provided at the point of adoption to the approved adopter).\nThe first step is to our Adoption Application here: https://elmorehumane.org/adoption-application-online-form2.html .\nIMPORTANT - we respond to your emailed applications and queries via email back to you. Please make sure you have either added our email (hselco@bellsouth.net) to your contact list or that you routinely check your SPAM folder for our response just to be safe.

            "description": "Just Wow!  That's the best way to describe Magoo once you meet and experience his steady demeanor.  This guy is \"unflappable\" and seems that nothing can rattle his steady, level headed personality.  He can be silly and playful too, like his attempts to grab your toes while you walk.  This guy is a mess.  He is so incredibly polite and low key in the house, gets along great with the pack, he just blended right in with the other 8 males on the farm. He exudes a super positive energy and is a delight to handle.  Magoo has excellent recall and never wanders too far from his person.  He is handsome to a fault and has a brilliant coat pattern.  You just cannot order a dog more amazing than Magoo!  He is definitely a keeper so we will be looking for a special forever home for him.  He deserves it!  Send us a text or call at 812-267-2814 for our adoption application.\n\nOur adoption fee is a $180 non-refundable donation which includes:\n\nSpay/Neuter\nRabies Vaccination\n\n6-Way Vaccination\nHeartworm Testing and Treatment if necessary\nWorming \nSocialization with other dogs \nHistory of Origin of your new pet, complete medical history and veterinary contacts\nDedicated support after Adoption\nLifelong Safety Net for your Pet\nTips for your individual dog for a successful adoption and transition\n   \nWe do not adopt out any dog as housebroken. Housebreaking your new pet is an important part of the bonding process and is a necessary commitment for a successful transition. Those first few weeks in your  home are when your new dog learns to trust and respect you, as his person. When adopting make sure you have thought out a potty training routine ahead of time, before bringing a new dog into your home.   We do reserve the right to inspect the home to ensure there will not be any conflicts or issues that could result in an unsuccessful introduction to the family.  In addition you may rest assured that every dog  offered to the public for adoption by All American Dawgs has been handled and under direct guidance of our personnel for no less than 30 days.  This time period is necessary to assess each pet, individually, for health issues and individual behavior  before they go to new homes.  Each and every dog, during this period, will get regular exercise via pack walks through the countryside and regular direction in  basic manners while  learning extremely necessary socialization skills.  Our goal is to bridge committed adopters to good minded companions and this is accomplished by helping rescue dogs learn the basic skills necessary for that next step, your family. \n\nAdopters must meet and spend time with their newly adopted dog via a scheduled Meet and Greet here at All American Dawgs in Rockport, Indiana.  We do not ship our dogs under any circumstances as they are members of our family and their safety is    Priority # 1.\n\nPlease visit our FaceBook site at https://www.facebook.com/AADawgs for even more albums and information of our adoptable dogs.  Give us a like and enjoy the updates of our friends and adopters.  The happiness and satisfaction of our adopters is of utmost importance as our adoptive families become part of the A. A. D. family.\n\nIf you see a dog that you would like to get to know a little better please email us at: \nAllAmericanDawgs@gmail.com or call at 812-267-2814 to receive an adoption\napplication to complete.  Once the application has been processed by All American Dawgs (usually within 24-48 hours) we will call you to set up a meet and greet day that is most convenient to your family.\n\nAnyone that wishes to meet a particular dog must complete our application process first.  We do not have an open to the public facility and the best way to reach us is via email  at  AllAmericanDawgs@gmail. com or text at 812-267-2814.  Please also enjoy additional pictures under photos on our FaceBook site  https://www.facebook.com/AADawgs",

            "description": "Last week we got an urgent plea for help for puppies in a terrible situation. Tiny babies outdoors in the cold. 3 were lost when someone went out to look but thankfully were found. All loaded with worms and coccidia. Poor Kipper has a broken leg which will require surgery and little Kina is very small compared to her siblings. Thankfully, we had a foster step up and we were able to get them the medical care they desperately needed. In just a few short days these babies have started to thrive. They are getting rid of those yucky parasites, eating great and learning what the good life of being indoors is all about. We honestly have no idea of the mix of these pups. They are estimated to be 6 weeks old. They are all very tiny. All but Kina weigh 2-3 lbs and little Kina is barely 1 lb. They are playful and developing little personalities. We believe they likely will stay pretty small based on their size now but that\u2019s truly a guess as we have no history on their parents. These babies will not be ready for 3 more weeks. Kina and Kipper possibly longer due to medical issues but that is something we we determine as we go. The earliest pick up date would be 2/10 after their second round of vaccinations, dewormed and they are altered. We will start taking apps on these precious little ones and reserving them to the perfect forever homes. \n\nAll dogs have a $175 adoption fee which includes vet check, age appropriate shots (atleast 2 sets for puppies), dewormer, heartworm test (if over 6 months), rabies (if atleast 16 weeks) and spay/neuter! Puppies will be altered before adoption. All rescues and shelters practice pediatric spay and neuter. This is essential in our rescue efforts and it is a policy that we will stick by. All dogs over 8 weeks and 2 pounds will be altered before adoption. There are no exceptions to this rule on all healthy and adoptable dogs. \n\nPuppies/Dogs that are not available for adoption due to vetting not being complete can be reserved with an approved application and a non refundable $50 deposit. This deposit is applied to your adoption fee and the remaining $125 is due at pick up.\n\nWags and Whiskers is an all-volunteer rescue. We also have full-time jobs and Families. We will try to answer all questions and applications in a timely manner. Please be patient and bear with us . Do not contact Parkway Animal Hospital as they are a vet clinic and can not answer questions on behalf of Wags and Whiskers. All questions and comments must go directly through the rescue. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION\n\nhttps://form.jotform.us/70898112177159",

So we know chickens aren\u2019t her thing! However, she\u2019s amazing with other dogs and people.  She is loving the walks she\u2019s getting at the Stray Cafe, and especially her newfound friends and all of the attention!  \nShe\u2019s house and crate trained, spayed, and heartworm negative.  This is definitely one girl you don\u2019t want to miss!  \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq\n\n*Any breed labels used by Take Paws Rescue, its employees/volunteers, or on vet records provided cannot be guaranteed.  Breed labels are given based on information obtained during intake and/or best guesses based on appearance and/or temperament of the dogs and Take Paws Rescue gives no assurance to the accuracy of these labels. Labels are necessary for postings to many animal networking sites, such as Pet Finder, and are no way a guarantee. Additionally, exact age and potential size cannot be guaranteed.",

            "description": "Last week we got an urgent plea for help for puppies in a terrible situation. Tiny babies outdoors in the cold. 3 were lost when someone went out to look but thankfully were found. All loaded with worms and coccidia. Poor Kipper has a broken leg which will require surgery and little Kina is very small compared to her siblings. Thankfully, we had a foster step up and we were able to get them the medical care they desperately needed. In just a few short days these babies have started to thrive. They are getting rid of those yucky parasites, eating great and learning what the good life of being indoors is all about. We honestly have no idea of the mix of these pups. They are estimated to be 6 weeks old. They are all very tiny. All but Kina weigh 2-3 lbs and little Kina is barely 1 lb. They are playful and developing little personalities. We believe they likely will stay pretty small based on their size now but that\u2019s truly a guess as we have no history on their parents. These babies will not be ready for 3 more weeks. Kina and Kipper possibly longer due to medical issues but that is something we we determine as we go. The earliest pick up date would be 2/10 after their second round of vaccinations, dewormed and they are altered. We will start taking apps on these precious little ones and reserving them to the perfect forever homes. \n\nAll dogs have a $175 adoption fee which includes vet check, age appropriate shots (atleast 2 sets for puppies), dewormer, heartworm test (if over 6 months), rabies (if atleast 16 weeks) and spay/neuter! Puppies will be altered before adoption. All rescues and shelters practice pediatric spay and neuter. This is essential in our rescue efforts and it is a policy that we will stick by. All dogs over 8 weeks and 2 pounds will be altered before adoption. There are no exceptions to this rule on all healthy and adoptable dogs. \n\nPuppies/Dogs that are not available for adoption due to vetting not being complete can be reserved with an approved application and a non refundable $50 deposit. This deposit is applied to your adoption fee and the remaining $125 is due at pick up.\n\nWags and Whiskers is an all-volunteer rescue. We also have full-time jobs and Families. We will try to answer all questions and applications in a timely manner. Please be patient and bear with us . Do not contact Parkway Animal Hospital as they are a vet clinic and can not answer questions on behalf of Wags and Whiskers. All questions and comments must go directly through the rescue. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION\n\nhttps://form.jotform.us/70898112177159",

            "description": "Last week we got an urgent plea for help for puppies in a terrible situation. Tiny babies outdoors in the cold. 3 were lost when someone went out to look but thankfully were found. All loaded with worms and coccidia. Poor Kipper has a broken leg which will require surgery and little Kina is very small compared to her siblings. Thankfully, we had a foster step up and we were able to get them the medical care they desperately needed. In just a few short days these babies have started to thrive. They are getting rid of those yucky parasites, eating great and learning what the good life of being indoors is all about. We honestly have no idea of the mix of these pups. They are estimated to be 6 weeks old. They are all very tiny. All but Kina weigh 2-3 lbs and little Kina is barely 1 lb. They are playful and developing little personalities. We believe they likely will stay pretty small based on their size now but that\u2019s truly a guess as we have no history on their parents. These babies will not be ready for 3 more weeks. Kina and Kipper possibly longer due to medical issues but that is something we we determine as we go. The earliest pick up date would be 2/10 after their second round of vaccinations, dewormed and they are altered. We will start taking apps on these precious little ones and reserving them to the perfect forever homes. \n\nAll dogs have a $175 adoption fee which includes vet check, age appropriate shots (atleast 2 sets for puppies), dewormer, heartworm test (if over 6 months), rabies (if atleast 16 weeks) and spay/neuter! Puppies will be altered before adoption. All rescues and shelters practice pediatric spay and neuter. This is essential in our rescue efforts and it is a policy that we will stick by. All dogs over 8 weeks and 2 pounds will be altered before adoption. There are no exceptions to this rule on all healthy and adoptable dogs. \n\nPuppies/Dogs that are not available for adoption due to vetting not being complete can be reserved with an approved application and a non refundable $50 deposit. This deposit is applied to your adoption fee and the remaining $125 is due at pick up.\n\nWags and Whiskers is an all-volunteer rescue. We also have full-time jobs and Families. We will try to answer all questions and applications in a timely manner. Please be patient and bear with us . Do not contact Parkway Animal Hospital as they are a vet clinic and can not answer questions on behalf of Wags and Whiskers. All questions and comments must go directly through the rescue. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION\n\nhttps://form.jotform.us/70898112177159",

Squash is approx. 2 years old. Squash is a spayed female, Pit Bull/Heeler Mix. Squash is a very sweet, sensitive little girl. She is nervous about people, in a timid way. She doesn't like yelling or really loud noises. Squash has Horners Syndorme to the left side of her face, this has caused a drooping effect, most likely she was born with this syndrome, it doesn't cause her any issues, it doesn't bother her, but does make pictures hard. She would love a quiet family, who would dote on her, make her apart of the family, take her places like the beach, give her time to adjust to her new life. She would prefer children over the age of 12yrs, dogs who are calm like her, shes not to sure about cats. She would like room to run, and no apartments. \n\nNow that we have listed what she needs in a home, let us tell you about what we see in her!!! Squash is the squishiest, sweetest, intelligent, loving pup.

Sadie is seeking stability in her life with an adopter who has the time to devote to her. \n\nSadie is reserved at first meet and just needs a little time to trust. Once she's comfortable, her true self shines! She needs lots of exercise to keep her mind and body happy! Sadie is working on leash walking manners and is very food motivated. She knows some basic commands and is eager to learn more. Sadie is affectionate and enjoys a good back scratch! \n\n***Sadie must go to a home with another confident dog(s). She will need to meet any potential canine siblings prior to adoption, to ensure compatibility. Any children in the home must be 16 and older. There cannot be any cats or small animals in the home\n\nSadie is 3 years old, 56 lbs., spayed and current on vaccinations. \n\nWe kindly ask, if you have any questions regarding Sadie, PLEASE EMAIL:\n\n adoption@popememorialcvhs.org\n\n\n**********************************************************\n\nHow To Adopt a Pet\n\nWe are currently offering adoptions by appointment only, due to the Coronavirus. The Adoption Center remains closed to drop-in visitors.\n\nThe process to schedule an appointment begins with the submission of an application, which can be found on our website. Once the application is approved, we will reach out to you to schedule an appointment. Please bear with us, the new process has slowed our response time.\n\nIf you do not see an animal that would fit into your home, we highly recommend checking our website weekly as new animals may become available. We do not offer a waitlist for specific breeds, types, etc. \n\nAs always, adoptions are first come, first serve, meaning the applicant who is approved first gets their choice of available appointment times and thus his/her choice of animals to meet and adopt. We are not able to extend holds on any animals at this time, so we ask interested adopters to make their adoption decision during their appointment and be prepared to take their new pet home with you.\n\nThe easiest way to communicate with us with any questions is via email to: \n\nadoption@popememorialcvhs.org\n\n\nNo phone calls please - Submit an application here ----> \n\nhttps://popememorialcvhs.org/adoption-application Primary Color: Brown Secondary Color: Grey Weight: 56lbs Age: 3yrs 0mths 1wks Animal has been Spayed",

It was a heartbreaking decision, but this handsome, senior border collie-beagle seems to understand and is ready for his true, forever home.\n\nJack loves staying close to his people while inside, but is also independent when he\u2019s out searching for new smells in the backyard. He adores going on walks with his two foster sisters. He\u2019s amazing on the leash and is so happy when he gets to stop and smell something new. He\u2019s up for two walks a day and once he gets home, is so proud of himself after his big adventure.\n\nJack loves people and gets along great with other dogs. He\u2019s very chatty. His hound side comes out when he talks to his people, especially when he\u2019s happy to see them, when it\u2019s time for a walk, or (of course) when it\u2019s time to eat.\nThis laid-back boy really enjoys family time but won\u2019t turn down a chance to nap. (We feel the same, Jack.)\n\nJack requires frequent potty breaks during the day and wears a doggy diaper at night. He takes medication for pain to keep him feeling his best.\nHis perfect home would be a calm family where someone would take him on walks and be around most of the time. He\u2019d like a fenced-in backyard to keep him safe. He needs a home without cats and children, and with a calm, low-energy adult dog.\n\nJack is being fostered in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nApplication link-\nhttps://prbcr.org/bor.../border-collie-adoption-application/\n\nPRBCR needs a satisfactory vet reference with records of annual exam, vaccines, heartworm test, and purchase records for your dogs monthly year round heartworm preventatives, and vetting for cats. We adopt to homes in NC, SC, and GA. The adoption fee is $250.00, and the final step of the application for adoption process is the home visit. \n\nThank you for your interest in adopting a rescue dog!",

Dottie was rescued from a rural shelter with parvo.  She was treated and it now happy and healthy.  \n\nDottie currently with lives dogs, cats, and a 10 month old child and she does great with all of the above.  \n\n\nA note from Dottie:   --- Hi! I\u2019m Dottie! I am the sweetest, most snuggliest, adorable puppy in history. I LOVE puppy friends, toys, and yummy treats. I\u2019m a big girl, and will be a very large adult dog. My foster mommy says I am perfect! I don\u2019t potty in my kennel at night, and I am amazing with my human 10 month old foster brother. I am learning to sit, potty outside, and that people are not so bad. I love belly rubs and will never complain about a booty scratch! My ideal home is calm and easy going. \n\n\n\nDottie is spayed, microchipped, and current on her vaccines.  Her adoption fee is $175.  \n\nIf you would like to adopt Dottie and make her a part of your family, please contact ForeverYoursOKC@gmail.com.",

Should be fine with cats and nice dogs, hasn\u2019t been kid-tested\nand would probably prefer an adult home. Fenced yard preferred. Just had a dental, heartworm negative and on prevention, vaccines updated. Marcus wants to be someone\u2019s beloved companion! Please fill out your adoption application today at www.hsuc.org.\n",

Having arrived as a stray, his caretakers are still getting to know him. He has been friendly with everyone he meets, loves approaching for attention, and will try to get you to stay with him forever and give him lots of love. We have learned that Jack will be best suited in a single pet home. Jack does get over excited and will need some continued positive reinforcement training in a mature home. Our veterinarian team has found that at some point in his short life, Jack suffered some trauma to his right back leg. While the fractures have healed, he now has evidence of on-going hip joint pain. Jack is still a ray of sunshine, well managed on pain medication as needed. His SDHS veterinarian will speak with you more about his medical future. High impact exercise should be managed carefully, but activities like swimming and romping around in the sand are great low impact ways to exercise Jack! Does Jack seem like the companion you've been searching for? Click on \"Adopt Me\" to get started! Primary Color: Brown Weight: 53.9lbs Age: 1yrs 0mths 2wks Animal has been Neutered",

He's a pit and has a lot of energy and likes to have room to run. His vet is Pet Doctor in Theodore. He is up to date on his rabies vaccines and is not neutered. He's a lot to handle at times and needs a strong owner. Please let me know if you can help with him. He really needs a home where he is the only pet. You can call the SPCA  and they will give you a number to call so you can meet Axl.\n\n\nCONTACT:\nIf you would like  to give this dog a good home please call the Mobile SPCA office at 251-633-3531. We are open Tuesday through Friday from 9 a.m.  to 5:30 p.m. and Saturday 10 a.m. to 4:00 p.m\n\nCAN'T ADOPT?  SPONSOR OR DONATE!\nThis wonderful animal is just one of many in our care right now. Your sponsorship helps us provide shelter, food, and tender loving care for the animals until they find new loving homes. Adoption fees do not cover our expenses, so your sponsorship will make a positive impact on our organization and especially on our animals\u2019 well being. Please note: we are not a chapter or affiliate of any national animal organization. We are, moreover, very grateful for your generosity. \n\nThank you!",

            "description": "Take a look at that attentive little face.  This girlie wants to learn and she has had a very full history of working on the farm.  Little has been around horses, dogs of all sizes and ages.  Her socialization around other dogs is complete.  Little takes regular pack walks with the other rescue dogs, sometimes 8-10 in a group. She knows how to navigate within a group and understands the words \"Leave it.\"  Little has amazing recall and knows basic demands such as \"Kennel, back, sit, ah-ah, off, etc\"  She learns so so fast which leads me to believe she could make a fun competition dog.  Believe it or not her Momma was a purebred red heeler who came to us with a litter of 7 babies.  This gal is not going to be a  big dog, maybe 40 pounds but she is going to be fun.  Little helps me build brush pile fires and knows the safety necessary, she helps me feed to the horses and she stays close by at all times.  She is very well kenneled trained too.  We are looking for the right person to continue the rest of her story.  Text or call at 812-267-2814 and let us send your our application! \n\nOur adoption fee is a $180 non-refundable donation which includes:\n\nSpay/Neuter\nRabies Vaccination\nMicrochip\n\n6-Way Vaccination\nHeartworm Testing and Treatment if necessary\nWorming \nSocialization with other dogs \nHistory of Origin of your new pet, complete medical history and veterinary contacts\nDedicated support after Adoption\nLifelong Safety Net for your Pet\nTips for your individual dog for a successful adoption and transition\n   \nWe do not adopt out any dog as housebroken. Housebreaking your new pet is an important part of the bonding process and is a necessary commitment for a successful transition. Those first few weeks in your  home are when your new dog learns to trust and respect you, as his person. When adopting make sure you have thought out a potty training routine ahead of time, before bringing a new dog into your home.   We do reserve the right to inspect the home to ensure there will not be any conflicts or issues that could result in an unsuccessful introduction to the family.  In addition you may rest assured that every dog  offered to the public for adoption by All American Dawgs has been handled and under direct guidance of our personnel for no less than 30 days.  This time period is necessary to assess each pet, individually, for health issues and individual behavior  before they go to new homes.  Each and every dog, during this period, will get regular exercise via pack walks through the countryside and regular direction in  basic manners while  learning extremely necessary socialization skills.  Our goal is to bridge committed adopters to good minded companions and this is accomplished by helping rescue dogs learn the basic skills necessary for that next step, your family. \n\nAdopters must meet and spend time with their newly adopted dog via a scheduled Meet and Greet here at All American Dawgs in Rockport, Indiana.  We do not ship our dogs under any circumstances as they are members of our family and their safety is    Priority # 1.\n\nPlease visit our FaceBook site at https://www.facebook.com/AADawgs for even more albums and information of our adoptable dogs.  Give us a like and enjoy the updates of our friends and adopters.  The happiness and satisfaction of our adopters is of utmost importance as our adoptive families become part of the A. A. D. family.\n\nIf you see a dog that you would like to get to know a little better please email us at: \nAllAmericanDawgs@gmail.com or call at 812-267-2814 to receive an adoption\napplication to complete.  Once the application has been processed by All American Dawgs (usually within 24-48 hours) we will call you to set up a meet and greet day that is most convenient to your family.\n\nAnyone that wishes to meet a particular dog must complete our application process first.  We do not have an open to the public facility and the best way to reach us is via email  at  AllAmericanDawgs@gmail. com or text at 812-267-2814.  Please also enjoy additional pictures under photos on our FaceBook site  https://www.facebook.com/AADawgs",

He will need an owner willing to commit to training him so that he is well socialized around others.

We just cannot get enough of this sweet boy!\n\nPlease apply to adopt Kookaburra on our website, www.spcaeasttx.com under the \"adopt a dog\" tab.

My owner no longer wanted me and wasn't taking care of me so a nice lady rescued me. I am very friendly to her and would love to meet you!  Please call the SPCA and they will give you a number to contact my foster mom so you can meet me. \n\n\nCONTACT:\nIf you would like  to give this dog a good home please call the Mobile SPCA office at 251-633-3531. We are open Tuesday through Friday from 9 a.m.  to 5:30 p.m. and Saturday 10 a.m. to 4:00 p.m\n\nCAN'T ADOPT?  SPONSOR OR DONATE!\nThis wonderful animal is just one of many in our care right now. Your sponsorship helps us provide shelter, food, and tender loving care for the animals until they find new loving homes. Adoption fees do not cover our expenses, so your sponsorship will make a positive impact on our organization and especially on our animals\u2019 well being. Please note: we are not a chapter or affiliate of any national animal organization. We are, moreover, very grateful for your generosity. \n\nThank you!",

            "description": "Bart will melt your heart! This older gentleman adores people and is such a sweet soul. He's a very loving dog who will snuggle up if you sit on the floor with him, and will leave his dog bed to check and see how you are doing. Bart can spend the day lounging around the house, but is very happy to go on a long walk or play with a toy. He is house trained and will whine if it's been too long since he has gone outside. He currently lives with two cats in his foster home and has always been friendly with them, and on walks he usually ignores other dogs or wags his tail when they pass him. Bart can be a little nervous around new people, but usually warms up pretty quickly, especially if they have treats! He is mostly deaf, so he cannot hear commands like sit, but he does respond to touch to get his attention.\n\n*Bart is a part of our Hospice Program because he has been diagnosed with large cell lymphoma, a form of cancer. This sweet old man is looking for a special family who will diligently monitor and provide care for his quality of life and overall comfort for whatever time he has left. He's ready to be spoiled with all the love you have to offer!*\n\nAge: 8 years\n\nHow I came to PAWS: Found Stray\n\nAnimal ID#: 48996\n\nWeight: 55lbs\n\nMixed breed (It's impossible to identify breed mix by sight alone, so for most dogs, their mix is only a guess. We get to know each dog as an individual and strive to make matches based on personality, not on breed label.)\n\nLocation: Foster Care\nAll our dog meets are by appointment only; to get started, please complete the adoption application. To learn more about this dog, please contact us at adoptions@phillypaws.org or 215-298-9680 ext. 16._____________________________________\nTo adopt a cat, complete the application at phillypaws.org/catapp.To adopt a dog, complete the application at phillypaws.org/dogapp.\nPlease reference this animal's ID NUMBER when inquiring.\nLearn more about PAWS' adoption process, locations, and more at: phillypaws.org/adopt/info.\n__________________________________________Adoption fees include age-appropriate vaccinations, spay/neuter, and microchip. Adoption fees are as follows, plus tax: $150 for large adult dogs (older than 1 year); $250 for small dogs (under 25 lbs) and all puppies (under 1 year); $60 for adult cats (over 6 months of age), and $100 for kittens (under 6 months of age). When you adopt a pair of kittens together, the total adoption fee is $150.\nPAWS, the Philadelphia Animal Welfare Society, is a 501(c)3 non-profit animal rescue organization dedicated to saving Philadelphia's homeless and at-risk animals. PAWS is the city's largest rescue partner and provider of low-cost, basic veterinary care. Through our adoption locations, special events, and network of foster homes, PAWS finds loving homes for thousands of animals every year. PAWS is working to make Philadelphia a no-kill city where every healthy and treatable pet is guaranteed a home.

            "description": "Penny is a sturdy, solid dog who likes to be around people. She is 4 years old. A Velcro dog who will follow you around the house, this pooch will lean in for pets and may even give you a smooch. While she has made progress in training, her adopters will need to continue to encourage and guide her on her path to good canine citizenship. Because we are not sure if she gets along with other dogs, to be on the safe side, we recommend that Penny go to a home with no other dogs. Because she can be rather exuberant and may knock a child over, any kids in her home should be 8 or older, dog-savvy, and sturdy.  \n\nPenny\u2019s ideal home is one where someone wants to have a constant companion nearby.  Although she is 56 lbs, she sees herself as a lap dog. And what could be better than a nap in a lap? She adores snuggling on the sofa with people. And she believes in equal opportunity. When her foster family\u2019s sons were home from college, she would wander from person to person throughout the day, spending time with everyone. She loves to be pet or scratched, especially on her rear.  \n\nIndoors, Penny tends to be loving and mostly quiet. Outdoors, she tends to bark at other dogs that get too close or at any dog that first barks at her. When encountering human males, Penny can also be a bit barky. But she has calmed down after a visitor sat down and, in another case,  after she was able to carefully approach a man to check him out.\n\nPenny has been known to counter surf\u2014when no one is looking. But otherwise, she does not chew on things that are not hers. Instead, she enjoys taking her time, savoring a Kong stuffed with something yummy.\n\nPenny sleeps in a crate at night, not making a peep even in the morning as her foster mom gets ready for the day. She doesn\u2019t react at all to the doorbell. She rides well in the car.  And she isn\u2019t food aggressive at all.\n\nPenny has mastered sit and touch. Sometimes she\u2019ll offer a sit and look up to you for her reward\u2014before you\u2019ve even asked. She knows her name. And sometimes she knows stay. On the leash, she may pull, but overall is quite good. With an adopter\u2019s commitment and support, she can continue to make progress on loose leash walking with a front-clip harness.  Penny's adopter will need to be committed to positive, force-free training to work on dog-dog interactions, loose leash walking, and other basic manners.\n\nPenny used to always want to meet people as if they were dogs. She would leap to try to lick your muzzle. But in recent weeks, she has managed to curb the urge and resort to calmer, politer greetings. Now, after being left alone a while, upon her foster mom\u2019s return, Penny will jump up, bouncy and excited, so happy to see her. But after a quick walk, she usually is back to her normal, quiet self. Penny is perfectly content to stay in her dog bed under a desk all day long as her foster mom works. Every few hours, she will stand up to get pet or to lick a hand. Then she settles back down.\n\nPenny\u2019s needs are simple: the company of a friendly human, a warm place to sleep, food, and a few walks. In return, she will reward a lucky family with a lifetime of snuggles and joy.\n\nIf you are interested in any of our rescues, please fill out our non-binding application which can be found here - www.hedgesvillehounds.com (or https://hedgesvillehounds.wixsite.com/home).

I much prefer to have my pet parents all to myself. Some may say that's selfish, but I say that I have so much love to give, I'm all you'll need! I'll be your BFF, your compadre, your buddy, your pal and everything in between! I'm a master at cuddling and will be more than happy to keep you company in bed at night. I'm also a master at keeping you active and making sure you get plenty of exercise. I love playtime and going for long walks - it's a daily must for me! I'm also a smart boy and have learned a few basic commands, but I'm looking for a forever teacher to school me for life. I can't wait to meet youbonus points if you're fluent in 80's pop culture and got the first sentence of my bio! https://instagram.com/__teddy__spaghetti__/",

At 5 years young, shes still got plenty of energy and would love to go to a home where shell get lots of entertainment and attention. When meeting other dogs in PACC playgroup, Navani greeted the other pups well and then it was playtime! She can be a bit exuberant with her greetings, so a dog intro is never a bad idea!

We have learned that AJ is very well mannered and makes friends easily. He is also just the right size for almost any home at 34 pounds. AJ is only a little over a year of age, so he probably still has some learning to do to be all he can be. Then again, he may know a lot more than we give him credit for. He always has one ear up like he is paying very close attention to everything! Email humanesociety@hsscg.org to find out for yourself if he may be the right match for you and your family. AJ would love to have a forever home. He is neutered, microchipped, current on core vaccines and has tested negative for heartworms.",

If it is too large, the dog will feel that it's ok to use one corner for elimination and then happily settle down away from the mess in the other corner ~~ The use of potty pads around the house may also be beneficial ~~ It is important to allow her enough time outside sniff around and eliminate ~~ Praise is also a curtail key in potty training, immediately praise her anytime he eliminates outside! ~~ Being kept on a feeding schedule will also help a great deal with potty training and helping Sasha lose some weight! ~~ Many dogs do not inherently know how to let humans know that they need to be let outside to go to the bathroom they can however be trained to signal to us! ~~ Pacing, whining, sniffing the ground, and circling are all signs Sasha might need to be let outside ~~Unknown how she would do with other animals or children~~Slow and proper introductions are recommended when introducing new pets or people~~Would recommend a high quality senior diet to ensure her health well into the future~~Would also recommend toys to stay busy~~Supplies can be purchased in the TCHS Re-Tail Shoppe!~~Is mellow and affectionate~~Is not a huge fan of nail trims~~Would enjoy regular moderate exercise to keep her happy into her golden years~~This sweet lady cannot wait to meet you!~~Donations and adoption fees help cover the cost of spay/neuter surgeries, micro-chipping, vaccinating, de-worming, any medical procedures and general care ~~DEPOSITS MAY BE PLACED ON ADOPTABLE ANIMALS by calling 320-252-0896",

He was never given a chance to be a family member. Otto hangs on every word and eagerly offers his head and side for attention. Otto's a true lap dog!\n\nHe is looking for a family that will support him as he heals from his hernia repair surgery and learns the ins-and-outs of indoor manners and basic training. He is like a puppy and will need a regular and consistent potty schedule. \nOtto's ideal household would have older kids, and Otto wouldn't mind a dog or feline pal!",

Sable has some skin issues, and she is being treated for them at the shelter. She is a sweet, shy girl who needs time to warm up. She enjoys spending time outside. She is very nervous walking past the other dogs in the shelter and we are unsure how she is with other dogs, kids or cats. If you are interested in Sable, fill out an online application and give the shelter a call to schedule a meet.",

Although a kind samaritan began looking for rescue, years passed and nothing came of it. This left Bubba and Sista to stay outdoors at their home on tethers, then in kennels. \nBubba is a sweet, lovable boy. He\u2019d do best as the only dog in the home. Bubba is high heartworm positive and is undergoing treatment. Bubba deserves a home like any dog does. Be his light!\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq\n\n*Any breed labels used by Take Paws Rescue, its employees/volunteers, or on vet records provided cannot be guaranteed.  Breed labels are given based on information obtained during intake and/or best guesses based on appearance and/or temperament of the dogs and Take Paws Rescue gives no assurance to the accuracy of these labels. Labels are necessary for postings to many animal networking sites, such as Pet Finder, and are no way a guarantee. Additionally, exact age and potential size cannot be guaranteed.",

If it is too large, the dog will feel that it's ok to use one corner for elimination and then happily settle down away from the mess in the other corner ~~ The use of potty pads around the house may also be beneficial ~~ It is important to allow him enough time outside sniff around and eliminate ~~ Praise is also a curtail key in potty training, immediately praise him anytime he eliminates outside! ~~ Being kept on a feeding schedule will also help a great deal with potty training and helping Diego lose some weight! ~~ Many dogs do not inherently know how to let humans know that they need to be let outside to go to the bathroom they can however be trained to signal to us! ~~ Pacing, whining, sniffing the ground, and circling are all signs Diego might need to be let outside ~~Has been very friendly with staff since arrival~~Unknown how he would with other animals or children~~Slow and proper introductions are recommended when introducing new pets or people~~Would recommend a high quality senior diet to ensure his health well into his golden years~~Would recommend plenty of toys to play with as well~~Supplies for Diego can be purchased in the TCHS Re-Tail Shoppe; all proceeds go back to help the animals~~Seems like a mellow dog who just loves to be with his people~~Would recommend regular exercise to burn off those excess pounds!~~Short walks around the block would be great for him~~Is very well tempered and calm~~Does well with brushing and nail trims~~Diego can cannot wait to meet you!~~Donations and adoption fees help cover the cost of spay/neuter surgeries, micro-chipping, vaccinating, de-worming, any medical procedures and general care ~~DEPOSITS MAY BE PLACED ON ADOPTABLE ANIMALS by calling 320-252-0896",

Please see our website for information on our adoption process.\n\nBenji came to TAGS from a local shelter where he was surrendered.  He was having a very difficult time in that environment so the shelter contacted us \u2013 understandable as that can be a very stressful place for a dog!  He is a 3-year-old Beagle, approximately 45 pounds and currently not neutered (TAGS will arrange for neutering when the clinic reopens \u2013 currently closed due to COVID).  He was very stressed, and the move to his foster home has revealed a very affectionate boy who follows his foster everywhere she goes.  He has come out of his shell and made great strides in his new environment in a matter of weeks. \n \nBenji is housetrained.  He sleeps in his crate at night in his foster\u2019s bedroom and settles quickly.  However, when you put him in his crate during the day and leave him (even for another room), he makes it know that he is not impressed \u2013 queue the howling that hounds are so well known for.  He needs to be put in his crate when opening the front door as he has a naughty habit of trying to dash out.   \n \nWhen Benji sees a person or dog outside he does howl and bark.  He pulls on his leash but this has improved in the short time he has been with his foster.  He is also getting better with his recall, coming when called about 50% of the time.  \n \nBenji is looking for a where his adopters are active and committed to taking him out for several walks a day as he has lots of energy to burn.  He loves running after balls and is very fast!  Experience with the breed or hounds in general is an asset.  Someone who is at home part or most of the day would be ideal given he does currently show some separation anxiety.   \n \nBecause he can get overstimulated \u2013 he is still young afterall! - Benji would do best in a home with no children or other animals.  As he is vocal, an apartment or condo would not be a good place for Benji.  A fenced yard is a must as in typical Beagle fashion, Benji follows his nose and will dig to try and keep on the scent.   \n \nWe suspect Benji wasn\u2019t properly socialized in his past life, so he is a bit of a nervous nelly.  He needs a structured home where his new family will continue to work on building his confidence.  He has all the ingredients to make a wonderful family member and in the words of his foster, is a real sweetheart. \n\n\t",

            "description": "My name is Taiki and I'm looking for my forever home. I'm 7 years old and I'm a big boy at 38 pounds! Foster mom calls me her Gentle Giant and says that I'm a really good boy! I've only been living here for a few weeks. I came from a commercial breeding facility, so living in a home with people is a whole new world for me, but I'm getting used to it. I love to run around and play in the fenced back yard here at my foster home. I like to follow foster mom around, wagging my tail and asking her to play with me. When I'm inside, I am calm, well-mannered, and still a bit cautious and timid. I'm not a barker and have been a good boy when left alone. I'm not sure yet what to do with toys and right now I'm not really food motivated. My favorite thing to do inside is when foster mom pets me and I will approach her when I want some lovin'. I'm healthy and I'm very good with other dogs, but I haven't met any small kids yet. Sometimes new things or loud noises spook me, but in the end, my curiosity wins and I come back to investigate. My ideal forever home would have a fenced in yard where I can play,  and another friendly well-mannered dog for me to learn from, but these aren't required. If you don't have a securely fenced yard, just know that I will need some patience with additional leash training because I get really excited sometimes and pull hard. I'm being fostered in Adrian, Michigan. If you live in the midwest and are interested in a Gentle Giant like me, visit www.savingshibas.com/adopt to start the process of becoming approved to adopt from SIRA.",

Josie is at her happiest when she is racing and wrestling with a doggy friend so if you have a high energy, sturdy framed playmate at home that you struggle to tire out, look no further, Josie will do the job for you.\n\nShe is smart and easily steered with verbal cues, she is practicing \"sit\" and \"down\" with lots of her favorite treats to keep her focused. She sleeps nicely in a crate through the night and will trade toys for treats. \n\nJosie would thrive in an active home with a yard and a resident dog to play with. She needs a committed owner who is as motivated as she is to get out and log those steps. Josie has done well around children but would do best in a home with older human siblings or adults as she not always as spatially aware as she could be and could easily knock over little ones!\n\nShe would also make an excellent running companion or thrill seeking best friend, ready to join you on any adventure! \n\nContact the email above to find out how you can meet Josie!\n\nEstimated DOB: 9/11/2017\n\nSponsored by Brian McNeill",

He can be a little timid of new people at first, but once he realizes that you\u2019re ok and not going to hurt him, he is a big love bug. \nHank lived with another dog and they got along well, but he will need to meet any other dogs he will be living with at his meet and greet to make sure they all get along. He does not like cats. Hank also lived with an older child, but given his size and energy level, we recommend a home without them or with children 10+ familiar with dogs. \nHank has zero house manners. He is a big ball of energy that just wants to play and be loved on. He needs an experienced dog owner, preferably with his breed, or breeds like his, with lots of patience and willingness to train him to be the well behaved dog that we know he can be. A fenced in backyard is ideal. \n\nIf interested in adopting Hank, please fill out our adoption application that can be found at the top of our page. His adoption fee is $100 which includes his neuter, rabies, and microchip.\n\nMessage us to request an application.",

Would easily knock a child or average adult (for that matter) over without realizing it. He LOVES other dogs and is very respectful. and takes correction well. He is a slobbery boy and can drink a bowl of water in a minute with half of it ending up on the floor. Leash manners are a work in progress but he is crate trained and house broken.\nHe will do best in a home with breed experience, no small children that could get forcefully knocked over, nor children that would be bringing a lot of kids into the home, a fenced yard and another dog to play with. It is imperative that he be exercised regularly to burn his energy. Ziggy is an all around AWESOME dog.\n\n\nApply today at www.realrottweilerrescue.com \n\nPlease note: The prospective owner must agree to a screening process that includes an application and the signing of an adoption contract.\n\nOur goal is to find the best match for our dogs and their new families, so that everyone lives happily ever after.\n\nWe prefer homes who want to go to an obedience class. Training strengthens the bond and trust that you have with your dog, and it's fun, for both of you! Dogs like to think and to be mentally challenged. The training you do together will be an investment in the future. \n\nWe will try to respond within 24-48 hours, but please be patient as we are volunteer based. We all have full time jobs and are busy with other rescue matters.\n\nThank you!",

Rott Rescue \nCleveland, Ohio\n\nApply today at www.realrottweilerrescue.com \n\nPlease note: The prospective owner must agree to a screening process that includes an application and the signing of an adoption contract.\n\nOur goal is to find the best match for our dogs and their new families, so that everyone lives happily ever after.\n\nWe prefer homes who want to go to an obedience class. Training strengthens the bond and trust that you have with your dog, and it's fun, for both of you! Dogs like to think and to be mentally challenged. The training you do together will be an investment in the future. \n\nWe will try to respond within 24-48 hours, but please be patient as we are volunteer based. We all have full time jobs and are busy with other rescue matters.\n\nThank you!",

            "description": "Introducing Chickie! She is a 7 year old Jack Russell Terrier/Dachshund mix (perhaps with some Chihuahua mixed in there for good measure!) and weighs 13lbs. Chickie came from her lifelong home where she lived with her parents and 5 siblings. She was extremely closely bonded to a sister, but was unfortunately separated from her after one of her owners passed away. Chickie has been learning to find her way without her partner in crime, but it has been a very tough journey, as she relied on her canine friend for her confidence. She came to us panicked, under-socialized, and terrified of even her own shadow. With patience and consistent handling, Chickie has slowly been gaining confidence and has been learning that the world is not a scary place. Chickie is just learning how to walk on a leash, but is finding that sniffing and exploring can be fun! She is also making progress on her housetraining. Chickie will need adopters experienced with fearful dogs - she is a project, but with time and patience, she will blossom into an amazing canine companion! Chickie's future home must have a securely fenced yard - she is an extremely skittish girl and is a flight risk. Chickie would love to be your one and only or pending introductions, she may do well sharing a home with a calm, confident dog to help show her the ropes. Due to her skittish nature, Chickie will need a quiet, adult-only home. Connecticut adopters preferred. To learn how to make Chickie your next 4-legged family member, please contact Michelle at michelle.p@poainc.org.",

This girl is 3 years old and 55 lbs. She is a little shy but she has a gentle spirit about her and is eager to show affection. Don\u2019t be fooled by her serious face\u2014 she is a happy girl that loves the company of her people and gets along great with other pups. She\u2019s always eager to snuggle up on the sofa and give kisses. As much as she\u2019s a calm pup, she is also down for a good walk or hike. Her fosters shared that they took her on a 4-mile hike and she was a champ! Adele is mellow and well-behaved. She knows how to sit on command and is potty and crate trained. Adele would love a playmate to keep her company and bring out her silly side, but she also rocks the solo pup life. If you\u2019re looking for a gentle pittie to welcome into your world, look no further! Adele is a sweet pup and will be a wonderful addition to a family looking for an affectionate, easy-going buddy.",

I also follow my foster mom parents around the house. \n\nI require a home with another dog and a fenced in yard. I need work on leash as well.\nNo apartment/condo\n\nMy adoption fee is $250, which includes my neuter, shots, heartworm testing, and microchipping.

            "description": "Axel is a handsome red doberman pinscher that was born on June 18 2020.  He is smart, playful and affectionate.  He weighed 64 lbs on January 28th and is still a growing boy estimated to be around 90 lbs full grown.  He loves walks, hikes and daily exercise.  He is a BIG PUPPY that needs daily stimulation and exercise.  He has a sensitive stomach so he needs to be fed special food.  He is currently being fed Purina Pro Plan Salmon and Rice for Sensitive Stomach's.  He can be a little shy at first but once he gets to know you he will give you kisses and more kisses.  He know sit, shake, down, speak and stay.  He would not be good in a home with small dogs because he if a bit of a rough player and plays too rough with a small dog, however, he is good with cats.  He will require basic obedience, continued crate training, house and leash training.  He would do well with a gentle lead leash as he tends to pull and he is a super strong puppy!  He likes to be the dominate one with dogs and sometimes humans so it's very important learns YOU are the dominate one. He is sweet and goofy and will make a GREAT pet for the right home that understands the breed.  Please be descriptive in your application on why you feel Axel would be a good match for your home.\n\nAdoption fees details:\u00a0\nPuppies - Adults $ 550, Seniors $375.

I was well taken care of until my previous owners surrendered me to the shelter. I am not sure what I did to deserve that as I am pretty much the definition of perfect. I really miss my owner but learning fast that I am safe and loved beyond words now. I am completely house trained and I know how to sit, shake, lay down and even roll over! I could lose a few pounds but that doesn\u2019t stop me from enjoying a nice long walk. I am learning not to pull and would need a no pull dog harness to help me slow down. I love to snuggle with my humans and being the center of attention. But at the same time I need boundaries and rules just like any dog. \u00a0 A yard with a fence and no dogs would be my ideal forever home as I love being the center of someone\u2019s world. I love toys and love to play catch. \u00a0I am extremely gentle and ready for my forever home who I can give all my love too! Bonus for me if it\u2019s a Guy!\nIf you would like to meet Morgan, please visit spotslaststop.org and fill out an applictaion.",

He would be happy to have another fur sibling to help him get his energy out. He has quite a bit of energy, but what puppy doesn't? We think he will calm down as he outgrows his puppy years. He is highly food motivated and will likely be easy to train. He is not fully potty trained, but he is working on it and getting better. He would be fine with dog-savvy kids that don't mind being jumped on or played with. He has not been cat tested, but has liked every dog he has met. He seems to like water, but we haven't gotten to test if he will swim or not because of the winter.\n\nApply for this pup here: swww.whenthegoinggetsruff.org/adopt",

He enjoys playing but also enjoys a relaxing evening. He loves toys and eating bully sticks. A kennel environment really stresses him out and it makes us hard to judge what his personality is really like. He can be around other dogs, but he can be a bit too high energy for a lot of dogs. He doesn't take corrections well from other dogs. He would do best in a home as the only pet or in a home with a very submissive and playful dog. Once trained and taught proper manners, we think his friendliness with dogs will improve. He wants to play nicely, but he doesn't know how. He is looking for an owner that is willing to help him with this. He is very smart and will learn fast. He enjoys long walks that end in some couch snuggles. He hasn't been destructive at all and his house training is going well. He has been through a lot and he just needs someone that will give him a chance. He has some fur loss from demodex, but it has been treated and is growing back. He is a super loving boy that will steal your heart if you give him a chance.\n\nApply for this pup here: swww.whenthegoinggetsruff.org/adopt",

I am a very active dog and am looking for someone who can keep up with me. I would make an excellent jogging or hiking buddy! I am a very confident dog and would be best in an adults only home with no other pets. I love to run and play with my toys. As a matter of fact I have been known to hide toys in the yard so I have something to play with later on! I can also be a very affectionate and loyal companion. I love being with people and getting lots of pet and scratches. I am a pretty handsome guy as well. Heads will turn when you walk down the street with me! So if you think we could be a match, make an appointment to come and see me. I can't wait to start the next chapter of my life with my new best friend!\n\nIf you would like to meet me,  please go to AlexandriaAnimals.org/Adopt-By-Appointment to get more information and to schedule a time to meet with me either via video call or at the shelter. If you have questions about this process, please email info@alexandriaanimals.org or call 703-746-4774.",

I love to play fetch and I occasionally get the zoomies! I am very outgoing and I am happiest around people! I seem to like other doggies but cats aren't cool. I can jump a lower fence so I will need a yard with a higher fence! I am pretty good for my baths and I give some very nice kisses! I am very eager to please and I would do best in a home with a yard for me to play in - no apartments please!\n\n*Please Note, If you have other dogs or children living in the home, you will need to bring them down to meet at the shelter before the adoption process continues.\n\nFor more information please call the Humane Society of Cowlitz County at 360-577-0151 and ask to speak with a staff member.

I am very active and love to run and play and would really like a place where I could do that. I am looking for someone who can match my energy level and keep up with me. Don't get me wrong though -- I do eventually settle down and can be very affectionate. I love getting plenty of pets and butt scratches. If you do those two things for me, we will be friends forever! I could see myself settling down with you on the couch at the end of a long day. I should also mention that I am absolutely gorgeous and have piercing blue eyes. Heads will turn when you walk me down the street! So make an appointment today to come and see me. You won't be sorry!\n\nIf you would like to meet me,  please go to AlexandriaAnimals.org/Adopt-By-Appointment to get more information and to schedule a time to meet with me either via video call or at the shelter. If you have questions about this process, please email info@alexandriaanimals.org or call 703-746-4774.",

            "description": "Howdy! My name is Jack; foster Mom calls me \"\"Jack The Lad\"\". I am a little over a year old and we think I am an Australian Shepherd/Blue Heeler mix. As you can see I am a very handsome young guy. I am good with other dogs, I can play for hours. Mom says I need an active family, I would agree with that; I need to be kept busy or I may get into trouble ;)\nI am a happy guy that loves to play out in the back yard. After the initial excitement of going fro a walk I am great on the leash.\n\nLife is good for me now and I am very happy: it wasn't always like that. I was found wandering a neighborhood emaciated, I was hungry and very thirsty. So thirsty that I became fascinated with drinking water, I put my foster family through some very worrying times. I would drink gallons of water and then i needed to get up 2-3 times in the middle of the night to go potty. Everyone is glad that's in the past. We were all sleep deprived, my rescue held nothing back on getting me help, I had lots of tests done and even stayed at the Vet office for a whole day, that was fun!! Those Vet techs are fun girls :)\n\nAnyway, nothing abnormal could be found and the Dr lady said it was all in my head; she called it a fancy name (polydipsia)\n\nThrough support and a lot of love from my foster Mom and Dad, I finally feel safe and loved. I still like to drink water but when it's limited amounts I do great. My temperament is typical of my breed; Active, Energetic, Active, Friendly, Active, Alert, Active and Protective.\n\nIf you are looking to get plenty exercise send a message to my rescue and my foster Mum will get back to you.Interested in adopting a companion dog or cat from Texas Animal Society?\nPlease email info@texasanimalsociety.com and complete online adoption application at texasanimalsociety.org\nCome visit our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/www.texasanimalsociety.org/",

Approximately 5 or 5.5 months old (Estimate).\n\nIvy maybe from a previous litter, she seems a bit older than the other 3 pups that were with Mom Holly in the pound, but they call came into the pound together. (Maybe Ivy has a different Mom altogether and just ended up with Holly and her other 3 puppies- we are not sure)\n\nIvy is very bonded to Holly and loves to be with her, but also loves being with the 15 year old in the foster home. Ivy will need another dog in the household to help give her psychological confidence and put her at ease.\n\nIvy did come into rescue with an injury metacarpal fracture in her front left leg. She has a splint on her leg to help it heal and needs bandage changes for 6 weeks at one of our vets in Edina and then we'll check the injury again (Basically the rescue will see her through this). Ivy is under socialized like her mom Holly but will break your heart with her sweet sensitivity. Ivy likes to sleep with the 15 year old in her foster home and really wants to bond and trust. Ivy must go to a home with another dog as she will need this to boost her confidence. Ideal home would be fenced in yard, another dog, maybe some older kids. She loves kids.\nfracture!!\n\nInterested in adopting? Please complete a pre-adoption application at\nhttps://redemptionroadrescue.rescuegroups.org/forms/form?formid=4003\n.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: We expect a high volume of interest in this puppy, so please be patient with us as we review all applications. As a foster-based rescue, we don't have a facility for visits with multiple animals. Meet & greets with dogs are arranged one the pre-adoption application has been received, processed, reviewed, AND approved.\n\nFor Puppies adoption fee is $450.00 for the age appropriate vetting they have had so far. (2 DHPP vaccines, deworming on a schedule, and will come with microchip) Puppies still need: 1-2 more DHPP vaccines and a rabies on an age appropriate schedule, and eventual spay or neuter (recommended when closer to 5 1/2- 6 months old) If you want the puppy altered with our vet, the adoption fee is $650.00 (adopter is responsible for the in between vaccines). If you want to alter (spay or neuter) your puppy at your vet, the adoption fee is $450.00, and we ask you to sign a spay/neuter contract and will need to show proof of S/N at later date.\n\nredemptionroad.mn@gmail.com\n\nhttp://redemptionroadrescue.rescuegroups.org\n\nAll animals fully vetted appropriate for age:\nSpayed or Neutered\nRabies vaccine\nDHPP vaccine\n4DX test (@12 months or older)\nMicrochipped\nDewormed\nFlea/tick prevention",

(notice his tail is a little blur)   He is crate trained and house trained. He would do best in a home with a tall fence because he can climb and get out. He is 1 yr old, neutered, and has his shots. ?\"Please email adoptions@petsandpeople.com directly for a faster response and we will send you our questionnaire.

            "description": "Peanut: 4-month-old chocolate and rust male, soon to be neutered, docked tail and natural ears. 12\", 8 lbs. Fully vetted. \n\nMeet Peanut \u2013 Peanut is a young, fun, bright little guy.  He is drop dead gorgeous, full of life and he has a spectacular min pin prance.  We are looking for a very special home for this very special boy.\n\nPeanut was dumped in a park when he was 8 weeks old, weighing only 4 pounds.  He was very disoriented and had awful diarrhea.  He was diagnosed with giardia and distemper.  Peanut is a fighter and made it through.  Sadly, though, the distemper left Peanut blind.  Most distemper survivors have residual neurological issues. Peanut gets what we call the \u201cno see ums\u201d.  He will jerk his head back as if something flew close and suddenly at his face.  It is infrequent and seems to be when he wakes up from naps.  Most times we can hold him and comfort him through and they resolve quickly.\n\nIn foster care he started feeling better, but the reality of his new existence resulted in a couple weeks of intense fear.  Peanut has learned to trust us and his environment.  He knows several verbal cues and is a quick and eager student.  He enjoys being cuddled and loves his \u201cscritches\u201d and \u201cpets\u201d.  He has begun to trust enough for belly \u201crubs\u201d especially if they are given in a sunny spot.  We are keeping a list of his verbal cues as this helps him know what to expect when we are handling, feeding and doing activities.   \n\nPeanut is getting used to a harness and leash.  We have been getting him out in a baby sling to get used to different sounds and smells.  He loves these walks and spends part of his outing cuddled and asleep.  He rides well in the car but sometimes gets car sick on longer rides.  This is improving as he gets more exposure.  He loves being outside on sunny days, listening to the sounds of the neighborhood, sniffing the breezes, and soaking up the sun.  He prances around our small patch of lawn executing little goat leaps of joy.  Peanut has some favorite toys he likes to pounce on and shake, he also will play a gentle game of tug.  He will nestle into his snuggle sack and fall asleep in our arms.\n\nHe sleeps quietly and happily in an \u201cx\u201d pen overnight.  We also have a play pen if we need him to nap during the day or just a secure place for him. He has his toys and chewie to keep him occupied.\n\nUntil Peanut can execute stairs, which we are working on, he has not yet been completely potty trained.  We take him out when he first wakes up and regularly during the day.  He is very good about wearing a belly band and about standing still for \u201cpants\u201d when we need to change his \u201cpants\u201d.  Peanut has been fine around other small dogs and does not seem to have much reaction to them.  He has not been around large dogs or a multi-dog environment.\n\nNo apartments for Peanut, he needs to have a yard for serious goat leaps and sunning. No young children as he is still learning that mouth play is not ok.  Also, if he gets fearful, he gets nippy.  He is easy for an adult to handle and control him, but it might be scary and unsafe for a child. \n \nPeanut is an adorable loving little min pin, and will need an experienced home with lots of loving patience while he acclimates to a new household. Blind dogs compensate for their loss of sight with heightened sense of touch, smell, and hearing. He can live a full perfectly normal life with someone that is ready to commit to teaching him how to navigate in a sightless world.  His forever home will need to continue with his established verbal cues while adding new ones.  \n\nAre you the perfect home for dear Peanut? He will be available around the second week of February, after his neuter appointment, so get your application in and approved now!  If you think you have what it takes to be Peanut's forever home, please submit an application today!\n\nNote: Peanut is located in San Mateo County, CA - and we will not fly this boy.\n\nIf you wish to adopt, please fill out our IMPS Min Pin Adoption Application at: \nhttps://minpinrescue.org/home.html\n\nIf you have previously submitted an application, there is no need to re-apply.\n\nFor more details, contact Sue at:  kellruss@earthlink.net\n\nIMPS is a non-profit rescue organization that does not have a viewing facility to which you can come and meet the dogs available for adoption.

            "description": "Nina is a LARGE, friendly, goofy dog. Unfornately Nina does not always get along with other dogs or small animals and her previous owners didn't feel they could manage this aggression.\nTypical of the Maremma breed, she can be independent and free-thinking. She will require a guardian who can keep her safe but busy so she doesn't get bored, wander, and get herself into trouble. She has a history of jumping fences (under 5ft) Being a guardian breed, Maremmas can be suspicious of strangers but are gentle, affectionate, and very loyal to their families. They do best with gentle but firm and consistent training. They respond to encouragement and positive rewards. She is partially housetrained and knows some basic obedience such as \"sit\" and \"come\". Her previous guardians describe her as friendly, calm, and protective. She is used to being indoors and outdoors. Nina gets easily excited and needs lots of exercise and outings with guardian. Good obedience and a confident guardian is important. \n\nNina is looking for a confident yet patient guardian, preferably one with breed experience. She has lots of love to give her new guardians! A behaviour counselling session with our Adoption Staff is necessary before adopting any animal to ensure success. \n\nPlease note, due to the current COVID-19 pandemic our adoption process has changed. \nPlease visit our website https://spca.bc.ca/adoption/how-to-adopt/ \nfor more information and to apply for the animal you are interested in. All adoptions are by appointment only once we have received and approved an application.\n\n*Due to the high number of applications we receive for our animals, we will only be contacting potential adopters to further review their application.\n\nPhotos by Simon Hergott Primary Color: White Weight: 36.8kg Age: 5yrs 0mths 1wks Animal has been Spayed",

Therefore, I need everyone to let me warm up to them at my pace. I would love to have a family to play with because I am still young. I just need a cat-free home without kids under eight. I'm much more comfortable with another dog, so I really also have to have a canine brother or sister who is active like me! If you are willing and able to give me the time and patience that I need, please go to chqhumane.org and fill out an adoption application today!",

Galio is truly a ladies' man, he prefers women companionship while men generally make him uncomfortable. When meeting Galio for the first time, he may be timid and a bit reserved but he does warm up pretty quickly.  A good way to make friends is to offer him yummy snacks. Once he gets to know you he LOVES to have his back scratched as well as behind those cute ears! \nGalio is estimated to be 8 months old and he weighs approximately 65 pounds. He likes other dogs and would do well in a home with another dog. To ensure any dog already in the home is a good match with Galio, a meet and greet will be set up a the shelter prior to adoption.  Galio has shown interest in chasing cats, and would do best in a home without cats at this time.  Galio needs some more practice walking on a leash, but he is getting better every day.  He would love to go exploring and zip around a large backyard.  Because of his size and puppy manners we recommend any children in his forever home are 12 years old and up.  \nAs part of the adoption process, Galio will need to be signed up for puppy obedience classes.  He is a great dog and with a little training and lots of love he will become the best doggy he can be!  \nIf you would like to meet Galio, please fill out an adoption application at:  https://wishbonepetrescue.org/    Once the application has been approved an appointment will be set up for you to come in and meet Galio",

She says that the Alabama heat is not for her! \n\nAdley is heartworm positive, but will be treated prior to adoption. She will make an excellent companion!\n\nCOMPLETED APPLICATIONS TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER INQUIRIES! IF you are interested in adopting, the FIRST step is to complete an application! Please email for an Application or copy and paste the following URL: \n\nhttps://fs26.formsite.com/nogreaterlove/form2/index.html \n\nUpon receipt of your application, the rescuer and foster in AL will contact you so you can ask any specific questions you may have! If there is more than one decision maker in the home, all of them should be in agreement! \n\n Adoption Donation: Unless otherwise stated in the pet's bio, our standard adoption fee is $395 which covers age appropriate vaccines (DHPP vax) and (Rabies vax if 12 weeks and older), utd on flea/tick prevention and heartworm prevention, worming, heartworm test @ age 6 months or older, microchip, fostering costs and health certificate.\n\nThank you for your understanding and consideration and for helping the dogs and puppies in need!\n\nWe do not adopt to anyone under the age of 21",

I can be a little wary of men, so please let me approach you first. Once I know you, I love asking for attention and being near my people. My friends at the shelter say I am very smart. I already know 'sit', 'down', and 'paw', and am eager and ready to learn more! I CANNOT go to a home with dogs in it, and I don't have any experience living with kids. I have lived with cats before and done well, so slow introductions are the key to success. I have no medical concerns at this time. \n\nSUBMIT AN APPLICATION HERE:https://www.baltimorecountymd.gov/departments/animalservices/adoption-resources.html",

Marcen came to us as an owner surrender through ARATT (Animal Rescue Assistance Team TN) with another dog because their owner could not care for him anymore. Marcen is a big love bug and adores people; he loves attention and is very affectionate. He is learning not to jump up on people and is learning the \"sit\" command. Marcen walks fairly well on leash; he does pull some, but not extensively. He is also a great car rider and prefers to sit in the front seat so he can look out the window! Marcen is an active guy that requires a lot of exercise, but he does have a lazy side once his energy is curbed. He gets along great with other dogs (he is currently being housed with Coffee) and loves playmates! During his photoshoot, Marcen thoroughly enjoyed playing with Coffee, Willow, and Noah! Marcen has not been tested around cats yet, however he is a hound and most hound breeds tend to have some prey drive towards smaller animals. We believe Marcen would do alright with a dog-savvy cat who was not afraid of him, would not run from him, and wouldn't be afraid to set some boundaries. Marcen loves all people and is good with children; he will accidently knock down a smaller child when he gets over excited. If you are looking for an active buddy to go on long walks and adventures with, look no further than Marcen!",

Tara loves squeaky toys and playing outside in a fenced yard. She also enjoys snuggles with her foster family and fur siblings, and would love to have another fun dog in the house to play with. Probably best with kids over 8, as she is definitely working through her puppy biting phase. Did I mention she\u2019s super smart, knows lots of commands, and is 99% housetrained already? Tara is 12 weeks old and weighs 13lbs. No idea on breed, but we\u2019re guessing terrier mix and she could be 50-60lbs fully grown.

He is a very good boy who already knows a lot of tricks like sit, shake, and wait.  Saxon loves to play ball and is very good at bringing it back! He's a very cuddly boy when he is all done playing and loves belly rubs. Come on out and meet smart Saxon today and he will win your heart!\n\nDue to Covid, we now work by appointment only and work on a first come basis.  If you are interested in making an appointment, please call the HCHS at 512-793-5463.  You can see all our available animals at HillCountryHumaneSociety.org.\nAll our adoptable dogs are treated for fleas, given DHPPV and Bordatella vaccines and are de-wormed.  \nWhen you adopt one of our animals it will be micro chipped and registered at the time of adoption.  Also, if not already altered, you will receive a voucher to get your animal spay/neutered.\nWhile we do our best to determine the breeds of our dogs, the majority are strays, and we have only general appearance, coat type, size, ear type, tail, tongue color and coat color to base breed on.  It is always possible when adopting a puppy that it will change dramatically to look like another breed.\n\n",

            "description": "Found stray at no fault of his own, Kramer was brought to the shelter. Kramer is about one year old and has tons of potential along with a lot of growing up to do! He is fun-loving, playful, and energetic, but he's also a big goofball that can be a handful at times. He will highly benefit from a home that is able and willing to train an oversized puppy, provide structure, and engage in lots of activities and exercise. Kramer walks well on leash and appears to be housebroken, but crate training and continued housebreaking routines are highly advised for this young fella. He appears to love other dogs, but a formal meet has not been done yet. Dogs will be required to have a supervised visit with staff prior to adoption. We think Kramer would do best with a female dog, who will be tolerant of his puppy shenanigans and be able to help him with his manners. Cats are unknown, and if placed with cats we ask for a very slow, well-managed introduction once in the home. We will only place Kramer with children 14 years or older due to his periodic short spurts of \"rough puppy-play. If Kramer is the young, fun, active, and on-the-go guy you've been searching for, please apply to meet him!",

He is fully crate trained and is making great progress with potty training. He's went several days without an accident now. Waylon gets along great with other dogs and has done great with the kiddos he's met so far. He will need lots of exercise and we require our pups get enrolled in training classes after adoption. Neutered, fully vetted and vaccinated, microchipped, and ready for his furever family!\nTo help pay for vet bills and care (transportation, food, toys, etc..) a $300 donation is requested at the time of adoption. All of our adoptions are contingent upon an approved application, home visit, reference check, obedience training agreement, and signing of adoption contract. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, and microchipped before adoption. Our dogs are companion animals that live indoors as part of your family. Please do not apply if your plan is to have them as outside dogs, garage dogs, porch dogs or outside kennel dogs. We do not ship dogs. All of our dogs are in private foster homes. We are not a shelter with hours. A visit can be arranaged after an adoption questionnaire has been filled out and sent in. Please try email first. We are all volunteers that work so we can not easily take or make phone calls.",

Also, if not already altered, you will receive a voucher to get your animal spay/neutered.\nWhile we do our best to determine the breeds of our dogs, the majority are strays, and we have only general appearance, coat type, size, ear type, tail, tongue color and coat color to base breed on.  It is always possible when adopting a puppy that it will change dramatically to look like another breed.\n\n",

Wagging tail at front of kennel. Tried to back out of leash a few times but was easy to leash afterwards. On return, entered kennel with ease and allowed me to remove leash.\nLeash Skills - Pulls Minimally On Leash. Walks well with infrequent pulling. Walked past a colony cat within 6 feet or so, and Candy Girl either did not see the cat or did not react. Also walked past a dog in a run, and Candy showed no reaction. She did pull towards a man walking about 10 feet away with her tail wagging. Mouthed at leash a few times but no actual leash biting.\nHandleability - Loose/Allows all handling. Would jump up on handler and give kisses. Solicited lots of attention in run by leaning head against handler's legs. Affectionate and social. Allowed handling all over, including ears and face. Medium energy level; would sniff around the run, return to handler for attention, then continue exploring.\nTag - Engages in play. Likes to play tag, becomes excited while playing but then settles back down as soon as handler stops.\nToys - Accepts a trade. Loves to play tug-of-war with rope toys, and will bring a rope toy over to handler and press it against legs when she wants to play. Chased ball but didn't take possession. Dropped toy and lost interest when handler stopped playing tug-of-war with her.\nColor Level Gold. Playful, easily handled, medium energy level and very friendly.\n(1/25) Per APO -- Dog is healthy, very sweet behavior.\n\n\nThis animal is currently available from foster care through ACCT Philly's Adoptions Programs. This animal is not onsite. If the foster has not listed a personal email, contact foster@acctphilly.org to be put in touch with the foster. \n\nWe encourage you to visit our shelter during our adoption hours to view our complete selection of available animals. In preparation for your visit, please make sure to visit http://www.acctphilly.org/adopt/ to review our adoption requirements, hours of operation, upcoming events, and more! \n\nIs this your missing pet?

We are thankful he wasn\u2019t shot but he was injured, had a tummy full of rocks and had been discarded like trash.\n\nFast forward a few months?\nCorbie is a handsome male chihuahua that is approximately 1-2 years old. He loves to sit on his foster parents lap. He is such a gentle soul and loves to be with his humans. He goes to bed with them each night but does not stay long, as he likes to spend the night in his kennel at the side of their bed. But he loves to wake them up each morning by jumping into their bed to tell them \u201cGood Morning\u201d. \n\nCorbie is very smart and learned the dog door within just a few minutes. He like to follow his foster mom around when she is working in the house or the yard. He gets along very well with their dogs and he does well around respectful children 8 and older.\n\nCorbie got a stuffed animal for Christmas and he carries it with him everywhere including to his crate to sleep at night. He also gathers everyone else\u2019s Christmas toy and carries them to his crate too. Funny boy!\n\nCorbie is not a barker unless he joins in with the others. He doesn\u2019t seem to have any food aggression. He is quiet, gentle and loving. He would rather sit on their laps rather than on the sofa with the other dogs. All in all Corbie would make one special family very happy!",

Frank has unforgettable eyes and lots of energy for outdoor fun. If he sounds like the boy for you, apply today!\n\nWe make it easy for you to do the right thing!

I am a young, eager to learn 18 month old who loves to play.\n\nI was adopted as a pup and returned without a lot of skills, but luckily my foster mom is a pro!\n\nSince coming back to Rescue Rovers I have learned the kennel is an ok place to be, how to lay down and be calm in the house, AND how to sit, wait and lay down on command. Foster mom says I am a quick study and need a new family who will keep teaching me new things.\n\nI love to play with other dogs, however, I am so excited most other dogs don't know how to take me and I haven't mastered calming down with new doggy friends yet. A doggy sibling would be great - as long as my people know how to manage those interactions and will keep up on my training.\n\nNow for the important stuff foster mom says I have to tell you...\n\nI am kennel trained now, but I will bark a little when I first go in or if I see someone in the house, because I want out with you.\n\nI am potty trained. I walk well on leash...but do get super excited seeing other people, so she says its a work in process.\n\nI am far too interested in cats to live with one and that goes for smaller dogs as well. For now I would probably do best in a home with no other animals. Also need a home with a fenced back yard because I love chilling there taking in the sun. She says an active home is a must, and if there are kids they need to be older because I love to play.\n\nWhen I and my siblings first came to Rescue Rovers as little puppies we were listed as pittie mixes. Now as I have grown up, Mom says I look and act much more dutch shepherd mix and she doesn't see any pittie looks or traits in me either...but who knows, right? That's the fun of a rescue!\n\nAnyway, no matter what I am, I'm a handsome boy with tons of potential. If you would like to meet please apply at www.rescuerovers.org",

Mary weighed 12lb 10oz on 1/26/21.\n\nSince all of our puppies are fostered in a private residence an approved application is required in order to arrange a visit at the foster home\n~~~ If you would like to submit an application for possible approval please email pupresq@gmail.com so an application can be emailed to you ~~~\n\nPuppies require a lot of time for housebreaking, training, and proper socialization ~ It is in the puppies best interest that they be adopted to families where someone will be home most of the day ~ Thank you for your understanding!!",

Lady weighed 13lb 2oz on 1/26/21.\n\nSince all of our puppies are fostered in a private residence an approved application is required in order to arrange a visit at the foster home\n~~~ If you would like to submit an application for possible approval please email pupresq@gmail.com so an application can be emailed to you ~~~\n\nPuppies require a lot of time for housebreaking, training, and proper socialization ~ It is in the puppies best interest that they be adopted to families where someone will be home most of the day ~ Thank you for your understanding!!",

They are about 10 weeks old, up to date with age appropriate vaccinations, and have been microchipped. Winnie weighed 12lb 2oz on 1/26/21.\n\nSince all of our puppies are fostered in a private residence an approved application is required in order to arrange a visit at the foster home\n~~~ If you would like to submit an application for possible approval please email pupresq@gmail.com so an application can be emailed to you ~~~\n\nPuppies require a lot of time for housebreaking, training, and proper socialization ~ It is in the puppies best interest that they be adopted to families where someone will be home most of the day ~ Thank you for your understanding!!",

He LOVES to play, receive attention, and keep busy any way he can.  He would make a great hiking, running, or playing partner.  Exercise is the key to a calm, content dog.  Cosmo was adopted as a young puppy but was unfortunately returned when they didn't have enough time for him.  He was stuck in a crate for over 10 hours a day.  We have noticed some protective behaviors that will need to be addressed in his new home.  Cosmo was in foster care a few months ago but returned shortly for this reason.  It seems he is very loyal and can become protective when someone enters a room where he is up on the bed with his person or is standing very close to them.  It will be important for his new family to discourage any guarding behavior and to reassure him that there is no need to protect.  Cosmo bonds closely to his people and will need an experienced owner who can work with a trainer to set these boundaries and ensure success.  Cosmo would thrive in an adult-only (preferably single person) home with limited visitors.",

            "description": "Wow! Check out this handsome boy! Meet Broly! <3 \n\n\"Broly is the laziest, sweetest cuddle bug ever! He absolutely loves attention, pets, people and cuddles! He spends 95% of this time sleeping on the couch and the other 5% asking for rubs. He\u2019s very food motivated and will eat his food extremely fast so he would benefit from a slow feeder. Broly is the definition of a big cuddly bear and would do great in almost any home! He\u2019s been the absolute perfect house guest! He\u2019s shown zero signs of aggression and would be happy in a home that can give him a lot of attention and food!\"\n\nEver feel like some dogs were meant to be with you? We sure do! Broly and his friend Ellie recently came into our rescue after they ended up in the shelter. Little did we know when we tagged them that they were actually the two dogs that their owners were hoping to surrender to us a little over a month ago. Sadly, we were full at the time, but we still had them on our foster list. Turns out they were staying with a friend and they escaped and found themselves in the shelter. We don't know what happened during the time they were on their own, but they were in pretty rough shape. We wish we could have taken them in sooner so they could have avoided whatever happened. At least, they are with us now, and won't ever have to worry about being on their own again! \n\nBroly is a 5 year old male Great Pyrenees. He currently weighs about 83lbs but is on the thin side. Broly is a dog that turns heads. Everyone who sees him wants to meet him. Everyone who meets him falls in love! Broly has such an amazing personality, and he just loves meeting new people! This boy is the perfect candidate to take out and about with you. He has such a winning personality! His personality can be described as calm and laid back. He is pretty lazy but always up for cuddles! His house manners are superb. He can be trusted with free-roam of the house. He has not shown to be a big chewer or barker in his foster home. \n\nBroly is uninterested in fetch and toys currently. We are unsure if he is a water dog or not. Broly has not shown to have any signs of food aggression or resource guarding in his foster home. He has not shown to be a big hugger and doesn't jump on people. Broly does good on car rides. He is okay on a leash but could use some more working with. We are unsure how he would do in an apartment setting. At night, he likes sleeping in his fosters bed or on a doggie bed. Broly is potty and kennel trained. \n\nBroly is just about as PYRfect as you can get! I am sure you are already trying to figure out how you can adopt this handsome boy! Before you do, though, here are some things to note about him \n\n-Broly does good with other dogs. He is initially curious about them and will sniff and give licks. Once he feels comfortable with them, he will even play with them sometimes. \n\n-Broly has not been around any cats. Given his laid-back personality, we think he would be okay with proper introduction. \n\n-Broly has been around kids as young as 4 and has done well. \n\n-Broly is being fostered in Moore, OK. We ask that his new family be able to pick him up, even if they are out of state. \n\n-Broly would be fine in a home with or without other dogs. His owner should be home most of the day, if they have no other dogs, though. \n\nSo, on a scale of 1-10 (10 being the highest) what is the probability that this guy is coming home with you? Yeah...that is what I thought. Be sure to fill out an adoption app for him at https://www.pyrpawsandfluffytailsrescue.com/adoption-app ;) \n\nHis adoption fee is $225. That includes DHLPP, Rabies, and Bordatella shots. He will be micro-chipped, heart-worm tested, have a fecal done, be de-wormed, be spayed/neutered and will be current on heart-worm and flea/tick prevention.",

They are about 10 weeks old, up to date with age appropriate vaccinations, and have been microchipped. Virginia weighed 12lb 4oz on 1/26/21.\n\nSince all of our puppies are fostered in a private residence an approved application is required in order to arrange a visit at the foster home\n~~~ If you would like to submit an application for possible approval please email pupresq@gmail.com so an application can be emailed to you ~~~\n\nPuppies require a lot of time for housebreaking, training, and proper socialization ~ It is in the puppies best interest that they be adopted to families where someone will be home most of the day ~ Thank you for your understanding!!",

They are about 10 months old and their adoption fees will include vaccinations, worming, microchipping and spaying/neutering.  Zeus and Xena were sadly surrendered by their owner due to severe allergies with their child. They were indoor/outdoor animals and are both potty trained.  They both get along well with other dogs and cats and they especially love kids.  Both dogs are very loving and will need to stay together.  If you are wanting to help 2 dogs in need, then hurry to the Center to meet Zeus and Xena.",

Best of all, he's housebroken!!!!\n\nHe loves long walks and kids. He is a bit of a barker when he sees other dogs (he really wants to play with them and just doesn't understand why he can't!). Playing fetch with the tennis ball is one of his ultimate favorite activities. Sawyer will drop the ball for you, or let you take it out of his mouth, he's very gentle that way. Hand feeding him treats isn't a problem at all. He also likes tug-of-war, I have some West Paw Design toys he's grown very fond of. The first few nights he was in the crate he barked a for about an hour. I learned with a long walk, a lot of puppy play time, and some peanut butter in a Kong, he goes to bed more peacefully and will sleep through the night.\n\nHe is a ham!!! Since he is a puppy, and puppies have energy, he has his ways of letting you know that he has extra energy. The main way is by stealing one of your shoes and then playing tag. He's a little mischievous there, but he means well. Once you toss a toy in his direction he will willingly give up his prize. When he gets super antsy he can be a little mouthy (not biting, but more of the herding instinct) so he would do really well in a family with kids that will get him running around using up energy. This is not a dog that would do well home alone all day every day. He needs activity. After about 10 minutes of active play time he will happily take a 2 hour nap. By the way, he snores and runs in his sleep- it's adorable.\"",

He should be good with kids other than accidentally knocking them over with his untrained enthusiasm. Benny has so much love to give! To adopt Benny, apply at ITVrescue.org.\n\nAll of our animals are examined by a veterinarian, given age-appropriate vaccinations, dewormed, microchipped, spayed or neutered, heartworm tested and treated if necessary.\n\nPlease realize that many of our animals are kept in foster homes. Please complete an adoption application at http://itvrescue.org/adoption-application/ in order to meet with one of our animals. There is no obligation in completing the application, but it helps us find an animal that is most appropriate for your family.  The ITV Rescue Center is open Tuesdays 12-5; Wednesdays 12-7; Thursdays 12-5; Fridays 12-5 and Saturdays 10-5.  The Rescue Center is located at 1417 N. Stockwell Road.  You are welcome to come to our rescue center during open hours to see all of our great adoptable animals. Thank you for your interest in our animals!\n\nNOTE: Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable, so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.",

Since we currently can't meet you in person, if you are interested in meeting this pet, please email information about yourself, family, residence and current/prior pet experience. If it is a good fit you will be emailed an application. Once that is approved, arrangements will be made for a meeting. Thanks for your understanding!\n\nYakko is a Chihuahua mix puppy born approximately 8/1/20. Yakko came from a home as an owner surrender to the shelter in Kentucky where his time was up. Unfortunately we don't have much information otherwise. We believe he is a littermate to Wakko based on their age but aren't entirely sure. Yakko's adoption fee is $399 and includes his neuter, microchip, vaccinations and \nroutine labwork. He is sweet and teenie tiny with long legs. His photo just doesn't do him justice. Please email us to start the application process.\n\n\nEmail inquires can be directed to availablepets@gmail.com\nAdoption donations for adult dogs range from $59 to $299 and puppies from $159 to $599. This includes:\n-  Spay or neuter surgery\nVaccines current to the date of adoption*:\n  -  Rabies vaccine\n  -  Bordatella vaccine\n  -  Booster for canine Distemper, Adenovirus type 1 & 2, Leptospirosis,\n      Parainfluenza, Parvovirus, and Coronavirus (DHLPPC)\n  - Canine Influenza vaccine\n-  Fecal test\n-  1st worming\n-  Heartworm test (+6 months old)\n-  Capstar flea treatment\n-  Microchip identification implant\n* Boosters required for puppies and kittens (depending on age) POST adoption are the responsibility of the pet owner.\n \nHeartworm prevention must also be purchased at the time of adoption and prices vary depending on the size of the animal being adopted.  Puppies under 6 months old are required to sign up for a puppy obedience class. ($89 deposit required, refundable upon completion)\n\nCome Ready to Adopt:\n\nIf you rent or live in a condo/townhouse with an association, bring your lease/bylaws indicating pets are allowed and if there are any restrictions. We require vaccinations and tests to be up to date for the protection of your current pets. Bringing their vet records can help speed the adoption process.

            "description": "Hi! My name is Grandma Shark! My previous owner found himself unable to care for me, so I've been patiently waiting for a new home since December 17th. When I first arrived at MACC, I was really nervous. There were so many new people, sounds and smells. I felt safest in my kennel and would bark at people when they got too close. After a few days, I realized that the workers here are really nice and I became more comfortable with them. I really liked all the treats they gave me, playing outside with them and getting pet. I DID NOT like seeing the doctor and getting an exam. I didn't want to be restrained, so I jumped around, wiggled, thrashed and tried to bite. I'm not proud of that part, but what can I say? I don't like to be held or hugged! Besides that, I've been having a great time here! I get to go on walks with the volunteers - who all love me, by the way. I even got to play with another dog in playgroup. I like to be vocal and play rough and rowdy with other dogs. I did get a little too excited while playing and the other dog and I got into a bit of a scuffle. We're both ok though. If I lived with another dog, it would be best if it was a social, tolerant male dog. And of course, a slow introduction would still be best. I think it would be fun to have some young humans to play with too, but maybe not the really young ones. They need to be old enough to understand that I don't like to be hugged. So anyway, if it sounds like I might be the dog for you, call my friends at MACC and ask to meet me, I'll be here waiting!",

Since we currently can't meet you in person, if you are interested in meeting this pet, please email information about yourself, family, residence and current/prior pet experience. If it is a good fit you will be emailed an application. Once that is approved, arrangements will be made for a meeting. Thanks for your understanding!\n\nWakko is a Chihuahua mix puppy born approximately 8/1/20. Wakko came from a home as an owner surrender to the shelter in Kentucky where his time was up. Unfortunately we don't have much information otherwise. We believe he is a littermate to Yakko based on their age but aren't entirely sure. Wakko's adoption fee is $399 and includes his neuter, microchip, vaccinations and routine labwork. He is sweet and little with a fluffy coat. His photo just doesn't do him justice. Please email us to start the application process.\n\nEmail inquires can be directed to availablepets@gmail.com\nAdoption donations for adult dogs range from $59 to $299 and puppies from $159 to $599. This includes:\n-  Spay or neuter surgery\nVaccines current to the date of adoption*:\n  -  Rabies vaccine\n  -  Bordatella vaccine\n  -  Booster for canine Distemper, Adenovirus type 1 & 2, Leptospirosis,\n      Parainfluenza, Parvovirus, and Coronavirus (DHLPPC)\n  - Canine Influenza vaccine\n-  Fecal test\n-  1st worming\n-  Heartworm test (+6 months old)\n-  Capstar flea treatment\n-  Microchip identification implant\n* Boosters required for puppies and kittens (depending on age) POST adoption are the responsibility of the pet owner.\n \nHeartworm prevention must also be purchased at the time of adoption and prices vary depending on the size of the animal being adopted.  Puppies under 6 months old are required to sign up for a puppy obedience class. ($89 deposit required, refundable upon completion)\n\nCome Ready to Adopt:\n\nIf you rent or live in a condo/townhouse with an association, bring your lease/bylaws indicating pets are allowed and if there are any restrictions. We require vaccinations and tests to be up to date for the protection of your current pets. Bringing their vet records can help speed the adoption process. All adults in the household must be present and co-sign the application.",

            "description": ",Due to COVID-19, all adoptions will be by appointment only. To adopt, complete our online adoption application and an Adoption Counselor will contact you within 48-hours to schedule your adoption appointment. Adoptions for any pets in foster will be completed offsite at our PetSmart Claiborne location on a case by case basis. The safety of our foster parents and community is of utmost importance to us and it will be at the foster's discretion if they'd like to meet at this time. Thank you for choosing adoption! \n\nMomma is a sweet friendly girl who is looking for a loving family she can call her own.  She is scent oriented and likes to follow her nose exploring.  She likes meeting new people and loves attention.  Now all she needs is a chance to show you what a great addition she would be to your family.\n\nTo inquire about an adoptable animal from the Louisiana SPCA, please call 504.368.5191, ext. 150 to speak with an adoption counselor.\nTo see more adoptable animals from the Louisiana SPCA, please go to http://la-spca.org/adopt.\n\n\n\nThe petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n",

She likes to be touching you in bed at night and sit on your lap to watch a little t.v. She tolerates the dogs and cats here and likes to pay tug with the puppies.. She is such a happy playful little girl. Her breed is just a guess but she seems to be the best of both of those breeds. Her adoption fee is $350 and she has been spayed, fully vetted and microchipped.\n\n  Please read all info below before proceeding. Please make sure you are ready to adopt before filling out an application. While we don't charge a fee to submit an application we can understand why some rescues do. A lot of time is spent reviewing applications. Time that can be spent caring for the dogs. To do all that only to be told that you now aren't ready or have changed your mind is exhausting. Please read all info posted about the dogs and if we say the dogs needs a fenced yard and you don't have one please don't proceed. We also don't adopt out to home with INVISIBLE/SHOCK FENCING and can provide you some info if you would like to understand why we feel this way. Because these are rescued dogs we don't usually know who the parents are so breed listings are usually an educated guess. PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU ARE WILLING TO MAKE A LIFETIME COMMITMENT TO THIS PET. If you are interested in this dog please go to our website  www.susieqdogresq.com. to fill out an application. A vet reference and home visit are required.  Please check our pet list to see more animals up for adoption.",

Bette is working on growing her confidence when meeting new people--but she loves everyone once she has warmed up and feels safe. A typical pup, she is still working on potty training and is very food motivated, which helps with training :) She loves other dogs but has not been around cats (her foster mama thinks she would be fine though since she is still so young). Pretty girl is looking for a home where she can cuddle on the couch or in bed with you, and a family that will love her just as much as she'll love you!",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Kaison! I was born here at the Big Dog Ranch Rescue and adopted out as a very young puppy. I was returned to Big Dog Ranch Rescue because they felt that they didn't have the time or space to accommodate such an active puppy. I am a very sweet boy with an extremely high energy level. I absolutely need to find myself a family that has a home with a great big backyard for me to run around in any release all of my energy. I would prefer an active family who wants to take me for long walks/runs and is interested in engaging in active games, like fetch, with me. Sometimes I can be a little bit mouthy when I am excited, but I'm still a puppy (despite my size) and just need some additional training to learn how to act more appropriately in social situations. Sometimes I can be a little bit possessive when food is around and should probably be fed separately from other animals in the home. I have lived in a home with young children and do quite well with them, but sometimes will knock into them simply due to the fact that I'm not totally aware of my size.",

(Carolina dog? Canaan dog? )\nVery sweet female pup. Approx 3 months old.\n\nInterested in adopting? Please complete a pre-adoption application at https://redemptionroadrescue.rescuegroups.org/forms/form?formid=4003.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: We expect a high volume of interest in this puppy, so please be patient with us as we review all applications. As a foster-based rescue, we don't have a facility for visits with multiple animals. Meet & greets with dogs are arranged one the pre-adoption application has been received, processed, reviewed, AND approved.\n\nFor Puppies adoption fee is $450.00 for the age appropriate vetting they have had so far. (2 DHPP vaccines, deworming on a schedule, and will come with microchip) Puppies still need: 1-2 more DHPP vaccines and a rabies on an age appropriate schedule, and eventual spay or neuter (recommended when closer to 5 1/2- 6 months old) If you want the puppy altered with our vet, the adoption fee is $650.00 (adopter is responsible for the in between vaccines). If you want to alter (spay or neuter) your puppy at your vet, the adoption fee is $450.00, and we ask you to sign a spay/neuter contract and will need to show proof of S/N at later date.\n\nredemptionroad.mn@gmail.com\n\nhttp://redemptionroadrescue.rescuegroups.org\n\nAll animals fully vetted appropriate for age:\nSpayed or Neutered\nRabies vaccine\nDHPP vaccine\n4DX test (@12 months or older)\nMicrochipped\nDewormed\nFlea/tick prevention",

This sweet girl has lost both her home and her owner due to financial issues.  She was placed in a shelter in Rhode Island where the shelter staff loved her very much, but Honey did not do very well in that loud and busy environment.  This girl needed out fast and a big comfy couch to snuggle on.  The shelter in Rhode Island sent out a plea to SNARR and as usual SNARR could not say no. Honey is now in foster where she is just thriving. Her foster mom says she is the easiest and sweetest dog she has ever had. This little girl is just a bundle of love. She may be shy at first, but once she warms up she is your friend for life! Honey also loves really loves other dogs and so we are looking for a home that has a dog that can be Honey's bestie.\n\n**PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING**\n\nIf you are interested in adopting any of the puppies, our adoption fee is $495 ( puppies) $375 (adults) which includes transportation from the South and we do suggest putting a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several littermates.\n\n**Please understand that we are a volunteer based organization. While our volunteers try to answer all emails/questions as quickly as possible, below please find answers to some of our most frequently asked questions. We ask that you please read these FAQ's to see if your question has already been answered before emailing additional questions:\n\n- If a dog or puppy is listed on Petfinder, they are still available. Please do not email asking if they are still available. If a dog or puppy is still listed, then we are still accepting applications :-) We do not go on a first come first serve basis, but on best fit for the family and most importantly, the puppy or dog.\n\n- We are taking our best guess on breed and size when fully-grown (or already an adult), based on the puppy's/dog\u2019s physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. We rarely are able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. \n\n- Our dogs/puppies are either at our Adoption Center in Brewster, NY, in foster care, or are adopted straight from transport. An application is necessary to meet any dog/puppy. Often, dogs and puppies are spoken for before they arrive. Many people feel more comfortable with a meet and greet which we completely understand and respect, however please know you are taking a chance of that puppy/dog getting adopted by someone else before hand.\n\n- The way to start the process for any dog or puppy is by filling out an application. Applications for foster or adoption can be found at www.snarrnortheast.org and by clicking either adopt or foster from the main menu. If you fill out an application, please make sure you answer all the questions in as much detail as possible and that you receive a confirmation email, otherwise we did NOT receive it.",

            "description": "HEY EVERYONE!!!!!! I'm Dennis Daily!!! I was named by my 2 legged (7 year old ) foster brother after a famous Canadian Youtuber. lol! I actually like my name and answer to it regularly. My foster family calls me Denny or DenDen.\nMy rescue story began when I wandered up to a house in south central Iowa. I was cold, VERY hungry, and lost. I was found with burn marks on my neck from an e-collar. I am very trusting of women and children and most men. I LOVE to play with other dogs and people. I might do better with older children because when I get really excited, I can get a little mouthy. I love to play fetch....but sometimes I might just want to keep the toy for myself. :)\nI think I was an outside dog up until I came to my foster home. Potty training has been going well. I am starting to understand I need to let my humans know I have to go outside. I am still trying to figure that one out. I am not a huge fan of pooping on the leash. AND I frequently get distracted with all the bird sounds. Birds are my favorite!!! I LOVE to chew!!! I am a typical 2 year old GSP. I am crate trained but still need more training on counter surfing (according to my foster mom). I'm not sure what she means.\nMy foster mom says I have a lot of potential for the perfect family. I can't wait to meet you!!!!\n\nComplete the adoption form here : ADOPT ME\n\n*Please be sure to read the adoption info/FAQ tab on our main website before applying for a dog. 2/2/21 2:19 PM",

This boy will make a great companion for someone who enjoys an active lifestyle. A fenced yard is preferred. This is not a breed who can go to a doggy park as they are aggressive towards dogs of the same sex, and likely will not do well with cats either. He can live with a female dog which would be good company for him. He is housebroken and has a very nice personality, and is happy indoors with you or outdoors enjoying cool weather. \nThis dog is not in rescue.

Yawl weighed 9lb 13oz on 1/26/21.\n\nSince all of our puppies are fostered in a private residence an approved application is required in order to arrange a visit at the foster home\n~~~ If you would like to submit an application for possible approval please email pupresq@gmail.com so an application can be emailed to you ~~~\n\nPuppies require a lot of time for housebreaking, training, and proper socialization ~ It is in the puppies best interest that they be adopted to families where someone will be home most of the day ~ Thank you for your understanding!!",

            "description": "Hazel is 3 months old and 17 pounds.\n\nShe loves kids, other dogs and running. She is doing well on crate and house training but being a puppy you will need to continue training.\n\nWe have her listed as a staffy mix due to every puppy in the litter looks a little different. She looks like maybe some hound, lab, bully, etc. We expect her to be 50+ pounds as an adult.\n\nAdoption fee is $125.00.\n\nShe is spayed, current on age appropriate vaccines and microchipped.\n\nThis is from her foster family:\n\nHey everyone! Meet little Princess Hazel. Her gorgeous eyes will lock you into her heart at first glance. Don't be fooled though, her kisses will literally seal the deal when you meet her. She has hippo-like squishey cheeks that complement her cute little snorts as she runs ? Princess Hazel runs like Goofy and is all over the place, but is getting faster every day! Princess Hazel likes to warn you of possible intruders, whether they are shadows, or you stubbing your toe on the corner of the wall. Either way, she tries to puff out little barks, with snorts at the end. This sweet girl is crate trained, and does amazing sleeping 10hrs a night with no accidents in her kennel. She also is crated when we leave the house for errands, and again with no accidents or whines/barks. Princess Hazel is spayed, microchipped, and up to date on her age-appropriate vaccines. Be sure to note, her paws are HUGE. This little girl will surely grow and grow and grow. She is going to be a big girl, but with a heart of gold, and a mission to kiss all the doggies with 2 legs or 4 legs. Oh, and she absolutely LOVES kiddos. Once she potties in the morning, she rushes up the stairs to jump in the kiddos beds and army crawl up to their face and smooch them good morning; all the while her tail is flapping super speed behind her. Her sharp, little puppy teeth are starting to fall out, so she needs good chew toys to keep her occupied as she is busy growing ? Princess Hazel thinks everything soft should be snuggled in, or rolled in, or tunneled in. As much as she loves to snuggle, her puppy zoomies can come out at any moment, which causes her to act like Bolt and take off in any direction, with her tail tucked for aerodynamics. Here in her foster home, she has 5 big foster doggy friends, and loves each one to the moon and back, and tries to get their whole faces wet with smooches every time she sees them. A happy, loving, silly girl is who Princess Hazel is. Don't you just want to meet her?",

            "description": "Meet Lennon, an approximately 11 week old pit mix who became a Misfit when she was 7 weeks old and in a rough shape. She needed to gain some weight and to learn how to love humans. This pet is spayed, up to date on all age-appropriate vaccinations and preventatives, heart-worm negative, and micro-chipped! If you are looking for an outgoing, full of life and personal companion that can go on daily adventures with you, then Lennon is your pup! \nLennon is somewhat cautious in new situations, but it takes her no time at all to warm up to new people and show them how much fun she is. Lennon will make a perfect companion in about any home, she is just that great. She loves attention and playing with her humans and animal friends, but she will also entertain herself with a stick or chew toy. Lennon is a puppy, so if she is adopted to a home with small children, she will need help understanding the boundaries with the little ones. She has a very sweet demeanor, though, so little kids shouldn\u2019t be a problem for her and she may actually enjoy running around with them. \nLennon is good with cats and dogs of all sizes. She lives with several other foster puppies and several large breed dogs and does wonderful with all of them. She has the energy to match puppies her age, but she also tones it down for older dogs and likes to gently play with them as well. Lennon is still a puppy so she will need work on potty training and kennel training, but she is smart and will pick it up quickly. Lennon has been with other puppies in her foster home, so once she\u2019s adopted, she will need some patience as she adjusts to being on her own. However, being more confident than her sister, she will adjust in no time, especially if she has a playmate.      \n\nYou can apply to meet / adopt this pet at www.muttmisfits.com/adoption-application!",

            "description": "Ruth is 3 months old and 17 pounds.\n\nShe loves kids, other dogs and running. She is doing well on crate and house training but being a puppy you will need to continue training.\n\nWe have her listed as a staffy mix due to every puppy in the litter looks a little different. She looks like maybe some hound, lab, bully, etc. We expect her to be 50+ pounds as an adult.\n\nAdoption fee is $125.00\n\nShe is spayed, current on age appropriate vaccines and microchipped.\n\nThis is what her foster family has to say about Ruth:\n\nEveryone say hello to Ruth....or as we call her Ruthie ? Ms. Ruth loves to run, and loves to be outside exploring and smelling all the world has to offer that day. Ms. Ruth loves to sneak attack her foster brothers and sisters, and then take off super fast so no one notices. She is a silly girl, and will chase a leaf blowing in the wind as long as she can. But leaves are not the only thing she loves to chase. Soccer balls, stuffed animals, sticks, and of course....shadows. Yes, shadows. She chases her own shadow full speed at night, until it disappears as she tuns around. Such a little goof. Happy....happy....happy....all the time. A soul to please all 2 legged and 4 legged doggies in this world ? She makes sure she does drive-by kisses, and may even ruffle up your hair as she does it, as she loves to burrow in hair. Ms. Ruth is an explorer at heart, and loves to take on adventures right beside my kiddos in the yard.  Her nose leads her to worms, and she will sniff and bark at them to let you know she has discovered something incredible! In pure puppy-ness, she needs lots of chew toys to keep her occupied, as she is starting to loose her little teeth, and growing into a big girl! Ms. Ruth has big puppy paws, so we know she will be a bigger girl once she is all grown up. She is very smart, and a fast learner. If you can't find her, do not worry.....simply call her by name, and she will come running, like she was called down for The Price is Right!!! ? Ms. Ruth is crate trained and has had no accidents when she is in her kennel. She sleeps in a kennel at night, and snores the night away for a good 10hrs. We also do crate her while we leave for errands, and she uses that time as her big girl nap time. Ms. Ruth is super excited when her people come home, and will forget about everything else until she gives you kisses to let you know how happy she is you came back ? She is spayed, microchipped, and up to date on age-appropriate vaccines. She will make an amazing companion, and with a lifetime of a happy-wagging tail, who could resist her sweet self!!",

            "description": "Valentine's Day is right around the corner. Can Sasha be your forever sweetheart?\n\nSasha is a 3 year old 29 lb mixed breed. We don't know what makes Sasha Sasha, but our software says she is a Cirneco dell'Etna/Boston Terrier mix. Who even knows? We think she is a gremlin/rabbit mix!\n\nWhen Sasha isn't impressing you with her athleticism, grace, and knowledge of obedience, she will make you laugh as she pulls out toy after toy from her basket and lies in the middle of her collection.\n\nShe is very smart and highly motivated and absolutely loves to learn! We think she would catch on to learning tricks easily. When she's not working her mind or her cute little booty, Sasha is an expert snuggler.\n\nSasha is extremely exuberant, and she doesn't always pay attention to cues from other dogs, so we think she'd do best as an only dog or in a home with a relaxed male. Sasha should not go to a house with cats. Sasha can be mouthy when she is overstimulated, so we do not recommend that she go into a home with children under the age of 12.\nSasha's adoption donation fee is $350, which includes spay/neuter, routine vetting and a microchip. You can apply for Sasha by filling out our online application, which is found on our website www.tarashouse.net or www.tarashouse.org. Please email us at info@tarashouse.net with any questions.",

She came to us the day she was giving birth to her puppies in early December. She got to us just hours after having her last puppy and we rushed her home to get her settled into her own whelping room with her puppies. She was a tad protective the first few days which is extremely common, especially under the circumstances. She very quickly learned my husband and I were safe and within a few days we were wrapped around her paws.\n\nThere are a few things that Grace is going to need to work on. She is a tad nervous around men. Her favorite person now is my husband, however it took her a few days to trust him. So she will need a little patience around men and would need a home ready and willing to work on that. She also tries to play chase with our cat every once in a while. She has never been aggressive toward her, just likes to play so would do best in a home with either a dog savvy cat or no cats.\n\nShe is completely potty trained and will let you know when she has to go outside. She is not in a crate in our home at all as she is potty trained and such a good girl. She enjoys just lounging with our three small resident dogs while we are away. She does let you know when she has to go outside. She does amazing on a leash and loves her walks. She loves to snuggle on the couch and can't control her licker, she is always giving kisses. She has met kids ages one and up and has done great with all of them. She has done well around all other dogs she has met as well, no matter how small (our residents are 7, 10 and 14 pounds). She is a gem and is going to make an amazing family dog for a lucky family.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Little Lady Duchess is a 1(ish) year old yorkshire terrier mix. She has a lovely soft coat that does not seem to need a lot of maintenance. Duchess is originally from Texas and she is ready to start her new life in NY.\n\nDuchess is full of fun and play. She likes other dogs and is very playful! Her fun loving spirit is contagious and she loves to get the other dogs to chase her in the yard. She loves to be outside and is getting used to this Buffalo weather! She can be outside for a bit and then she needs to come in and warm up but will go right back out once she is. She loves toys and balls. Duchess lives with other dogs and has no issues. She is good with cats but will bark on occasion just to see if she can get them to run so she can chase them around. It doesn't always work out for her lol. She has not been around kids in her foster home but if they are respectful of her, we don't expect issues. Duchess was initially nervous and shy for her foster mom but she traveled a long way and her life was turned upside down when she was disgarded by her family. There may be an adjustment period for her in her new home as she gets used to a new routine. She is good at going potty outside but will need additional training. She does use pee pads in her foster home too. She is crate trained and we just started working on her leash skills. Duchess loves to take naps with her foster mom and tries to weasle her way into her bed at night!\n\nDuchess is spayed, up to date with vaccines, microchipped, flea/worm treated and tested neg for heartworm. Her adoption fee is $400",

We're not sure of their mix, they look like chiweenies, but we are sure they are absolutely adorable. Up to date on vaccines, microchipped and will be spayed under the rescue when age appropriate.\n\nInterested in adopting me? To fill out an application visit 3 Hearts 4 Paws. Please note: we generally do not adopt out of state unless it is within 1-2 hours of us. Currently due to COVID we are unable to accommodate out of state adoptions.",

He loves being held, being pet & being played with. He would love a comfy couch to sleep on. He goes outside to potty when let out. He will need continued leash & harness training.

He loves to walk and goes a mile with no trouble. His only medical need is for eye drops which he will always require for a dry eye comdition.  Tramp is a sweet little gentleman who we feel was loved & well cared for during his life.  He is current on vaccines, heart worm negative, microchipped and on heartworm prevention . He licks his feet a lot and has been treated with Apoquel for allergies which didn\u2019t have much effect. We think it is mostly habit but his foster mom cleans his feet after a walk. \n\nTramp will gladly go out to go potty but can\u2019t seem to manage a doggie door.  If his foster family needs to leave for an extended period they leave him In playpen with a pad for his Comfort and to prevent accidents. \n\nAdoption fee $350\n** The Texas Comptroller now requires sales tax on adoption fees.\n\n** Temporarily Suspended due to COVID **\nMonthly Meet & Greets  (12:00 - 2:00)\nPetco (in Leander) every 1st Saturday of the month\nPet Supplies Plus (Parmer & Mopac) every third Saturday of the month\n\n\n** Please note: Due to their size, our dogs are not suitable for homes with children under 5..\n\nWe do not have a facility, all dogs are fostered in the homes of our volunteers. If you are interested in adopting a dog from Lil' Paws Maltese Rescue and other Petite Paws, please visit our website at www.lilpaws-malteserescue.org and fill out an adoption application. This is the first step in our adoption process. Our goal is to place our dogs in safe, stable and loving homes in the Austin Metropolitan area. Thanks for looking!\n\nLil' Paws Maltese Rescue and other Petite Paws depends on donations to keep the dogs in our program healthy. Many health issues are taken care of before a dog leaves a rescue: spaying, neutering, immunizations, dental care, and in some cases major surgery. Because of the cost of this care, donations are essential to enable us to continue our work.

Rocky was brought to the shelter on 01/27 by a person who said she was just trying help the dog because the former owner was making sweet Rocky live in a cage most of the time. Rocky proved to be too much for the Good Samaritan because he played too rough with the other dog in the home. They also said he needed work on his house training skills. Rocky will sit when told and is good on leash. He is only 11 months so he has lots of time to learn all the things he needs to know to be a great dog. He is about 56 pounds, and at 11 months he shouldn't have too much more growing to do.  Rocky is up to date on shots, now neutered, heartworm tested negative and will be microchipped upon adoption.  He is in run 810.  ID 627040\n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information.

Ella is learning what it's like to be in a house and to walk on a leash. She is making slow strides and is looking for a home without kids and one that is very quiet and calm. She yearns for someone who can give her gentle attention and to draw her out of her shell. She loves other dogs and may do OK with a calm cat but we are not sure just yet. Ella can never be off leash or be allowed to be in the position to escape outside because she would run off and that would put her in danger. If you think you have a safe home for Ella and are interested in more information, email us at adopt@scituateanimalshelter.org for more info!",

Please go to www.theshelterconnection.com or to the shelter page on Petfinder for more information about and directions to the shelter.\nNala is a gorgeous 5 year old Pit Bull Terrier that is unsure why she is in the shelter. Nala was surrendered with her sister when her family was moving and did not take the two of them with them. Her sister has since been adopted, but Nala still waits for her new home. Nala is sweet girl that loves her some treats, but sadly she is stressed here and therefore does not immediately interact with people meeting her. We believe that once this beautiful girl is home with a new, loving family she will come alive again. Due to the nervousness we are seeing here, we are not recommending her to live with young children at this time.\n**Reminder** We are facilitating adoptions by appointment ONLY. If you arrive at the shelter without an appointment we will not be able to accommodate you. Thank you for your understanding.\n",

Jack has already been through the wringer in his short life, having been abandoned when his family moved, he ended up living in an empty house alone for a time. At some point he contracted heartworm, and he has a clean bill of health now! He is pretty athletic so he should be great on long walks and hikes.\n\nHe is happy and goofy, however he will need to be the only animal in the home.\n\nHe loves being outdoors and really enjoys the fresh air right inside as well, so a big backyard would be preferred and an Arizona room would be a bonus! He loves sunbathing and a good nap\n\nHe knows basic commands well, is crate trained and walks beautifully on a leash and is very food motivated, therefore is very trainable. The training he has now will need to be maintained longterm. Jack truly is a special gentleman and he will make one lucky family very happy!",

She is crate trained and is almost fully potty trained. She walks well on a leash and is ready to make a new family very happy.\n\nA fenced in yard is required. No exceptions. \n\nIf interested, please submit an application via our website at www.anassafehavenrescue.org.\n\nDisclaimer: All information we know of Ruby has been provided. If you are able to see this profile, then the puppy is still available. Emails asking if this dog is still available will not be answered.

I am living in my fosters house with kids and other dogs, and while its takes me awhile to get used to the idea they are good-I still get nervous-I am really liking them all! The smallest kid is still a lot for me, so I dont know that a house with the little kids is best for me, but I do know I must have another dog! I follow my furry foster brother and sister anywhere, and if they do something so do I! Im slowly getting the whole I have to go potty outside thing- its like they want me to tell them or something! I will be sure to let them know when I am in my crate that I gotta go, and I think if they just keep giving me the good treats when I potty outside Ill get there!! I love my crate and my stuffy, and it is my space so if in there prefer to be left alone! Anything outside is fair game!\n\nI know Im slow to get used to you, but man once I do Im a fun puppy living the puppy life! Busy balls and bones are my favorites- and I REALLY like mealtimes!!",

She is house trained and crate trained. Brenda's foster mom reports that she is very affectionate with all people. Her puppies were all adopted and now it's her turn!  Like with every dog we recommend following a two week shutdown to help ensure success in your adoption. \n\nBrenda has been vet checked, is UTD on shots, dewormed with Drontal, on Heartgard and Flea/Tick Prevention. She is also microchipped. \n\nIf interested in applying to adopt with us please fill out an application and one of our application processors will contact you as soon as possible. We appreciate your patience.\nhttps://goo.gl/AzrASu\n\nThank you for saving a life by choosing to adopt :)",

            "description": "DOB: 12/18/2018\n\nWeight: 48 lbs\n\nWe are currently accepting applications to adopt Mila. If you are interested in meeting and adopting her, please submit an adoption application by visiting our website (www.HarborOfHopeDogRescue.org). Due to COVID19 safety measures, meetings are currently only being scheduled with approved adopters.\n\nMila is a 2 year old Rottweiler/Shar Pei mix who is a very playful and gentle girl. She is pretty shy when first meeting new people but if you give her a little time, she'll make it worth it! This girl LOVES zoomies, walks and getting the opportunity to slowly explore the world around her. She will need to have a fenced yard because of her love for zoomies.\n\nAt this time we are reccomending a home without kids under 12 due to how shy and sensitive she is to quick and unpredictable movement. We're still learning more about this girl, so please check back for more info!\n\n \n\nAll of our dogs are fully vetted before adoption, including vaccinations, spay/neuter, and a microchip.\n\nThe adoption process consists of an online application, a vet reference, two personal references, and a home visit. If approved to adopt, there is an adoption contract and an adoption amount. The adoption amount for Mila is $300 and goes toward the vetting and care of all the dogs in our rescue.\n\nAll adoptions will take place in the Omaha NE area and must be done in person. We are willing to adopt to out-of-state applicants, contingent on our ability to complete a home visit, but you must be willing to come to the Omaha area to complete the adoption. We do not ship, transport or deliver our dogs.\n\nIf you would like to learn more about Harbor of Hope Dog Rescue, please visit our website (www.HarborOfHopeDogRescue.org) or our Facebook page.

I'm a happy, easy going guy just looking for the right family!\n\nI sleep through the night because, who doesn't love to do that!? I also know how to be good in my crate and am mostly housebroken. I just need a few gentle reminders from time to time. If you enjoy a quiet laid back life like me, come meet me! I'll make you so loved!\n\nAdoption fee is $195 and includes spay/neuter, microchip, fecal/deworming, vaccines and prevention up to date. Ohio residents only.\n\nSTS is a foster-based and volunteer-run rescue. We do not have a physical location or set hours for you to meet dogs, and it does take time to answer each inquiry. All dogs are in foster homes and once an application is approved and a home visit is completed you will be able to schedule meet and greets with available dogs. We encourage interested individuals to get approved prior to searching as it helps expedite the process. A Petfinder inquiry is not a substitute for an application.

I love toys and with the help of my sister, Siri, we find those crazy squeakers and kill them after we play with them some more. I know sit and I am working on other commands. Im also learning to walk on the leash not so sure about that yet. I will kennel up (especially if treats are involved). Im your typical rambunctious pup that just keeps on going. I really like people and love to get in lots of snuggles and kisses. I enjoy playing and wrestling with Siri. I have not played with other dogs yet but have met the neighbors bigger dogs and love to visit with them through the fence. I have not been exposed to cats. I will need someone with patience that is willing to work with me on my basic commands and potty training as I am not fully potty trained. You will need to teach me where to go and how to ask until I get the hang of it. I kennel at night and when my foster family is away. If you are looking for a puppy that will want LOTS of attention and you have the patience for a puppy, I may be what you are looking for. I will need toys or chew bones to keep me occupied, maybe a playmate and of course lots of snuggles and kisses from you.\n\nI am ready to move into my new home anytime. I am scheduled to be spayed, I have been microchipped, dewormed and received my puppy shots along with rabies. My adoption fee is $400. Apply for me at www.bassetandbeagle.org if you are ready for a forever companion. I am currently fostered in Omaha NE.",

She was found running loose with her sister Blaire but it's time for her to strike out on her own and be the best she can be. Serena needs some help learning her manners, sometimes she gets so excited to meet someone she forgets it's not exactly polite to jump on them or nip at their arms. For this reason, we think she would do best in a home without small children. She seems to do well with other dogs but does take a short amount of time to get to know them before she engages in play. Her adoption fee is $80 plus applicable licensing fees. She is spayed, microchipped, and up to date on vaccinations. If you are interested in taking her home please fill out an application on our website and someone will call you to set up an appointment!",

Because Brown needs time to trust and warm up to strangers, a home with no children is best. He would love a home with a fenced yard.

NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE, EMAILS ONLY.\n\nMeet Freda, our cute little female Chihuahua mix of 3 and a half years old and 15 lbs.\n\nFreda's owner passed away and it was a very traumatic event for her. It has taken her time to come out of her shell and adopt, but she is a great little girl who deserves a loving and stable forever home.\n\nFreda is house trained if taken out routinely on leash in the back yard, initially. She loves her crate. It is her safe place. She is a good eater and enjoys most other little dogs. She lives with 3 other small dogs right now in her foster home and is bonded to them.\n\nShe has also shown us that she loves cats! We think she thinks she is a cat sometimes! She often would snuggle with a foster cat who was in her foster home, it was so cute!\n\nFreda just needs time to acclimate to a new setting, and once she does, she will be an amazing family pet. We would prefer to not place her in a home with kids. Ideally, her new home will be with adults only who are dog savvy, and with another dog (or cat who likes dogs) for her to have a buddy. \n\nShe requires a secure fenced in yard and applicants must live within 30 mins of Tulsa.\n\nEmail us about her today. We would love to hear from you at amyh@rescuednready.com. Applications are found at www.rescuednready.com.\n\n\nADOPTIONS ONLY TO PEOPLE LIVING IN THE NORTHEASTERN OKLAHOMA AREA.  \n\nThe adoption fee is $225.00 and includes all current vaccinations, negative heartworm test, worming, microchip, and spay/neuter surgery.  Go to www.rescuednready.com to learn about our adoption process and download our application.  \n\nCALL or EMAIL US TO MEET ONE OF OUR ADOPTABLE DOGS! Call Amy at 918-688-0755 or email at amyh@rescuednready.com.\n\nLIKE RESCUED 'N READY ON FACEBOOK!!",

I absolutely love other dogs and I will need a companion dog to give me security and someone to play with. My foster mom thinks that I was used as a breeder dog because I have obviously had some litters and I are not well socialized with people. I will need a very understanding family who can teach me how to be a dog and that humans can be nice. It won\u2019t take me long to learn as I am very smart! If you want to meet me please apply at www.labrescue.net or email info@labrescue.net if you are already approved.\n\nThank you for your interest in adopting from Lab Rescue OK!\n\nThe FIRST STEP in the adoption process is to fill out a Adoption Application at www.labrescue.net.\n\nProcessing of a application usually takes 5-7 days. \n\n*** Labs are not placed on a first come, first approved basis.

I was found cold and shivering in a falling-down tin shack barn in South Corpus Christi.  At that time, I was having trouble moving so local neighbors were leaving food for me.  Then my wonderful foster family took me in and it was found that I had multiple small fractures on my pelvis and a fracture in my neck.  They nursed me back to good health and now I'm bouncing around with my buddy Astro, who was another rescue dog.  I do have a crooked tail that was from another injury that happened before I was rescued by Cuz i Matter Animal Rescue.  My foster Mom has said that I am just the sweetest pup and that I am also potty trained.\n\nI am looking for a good loving home to call my own, with lots of attention from the new adopters.  If you'd like more information about me, please send CiMAR an email so they can send you all the information about adopting me.  You can also find more pictures of me on their website:  http://www.cuzimatter.org/adopt-a-dog.",

We are thinking Light is a Lab mix about 1-year-old.\n\nHe grew up in an outside pen with his brothers and sisters, but little human interaction. He is gentle and respectful with adults and children he knows but we don't yet know how he is with new people. Light appears to be behind in socialization with people, other pets, and new places. A potential adopter will need to keep this in mind and go slow, work on socialization, give him plenty of exercise, and provide training and structure as he transitions to life in a forever home. He would do best in a low-key household without much foot traffic, no young children, and lots of patience and treats!\n\nLight likes other dogs but they need to be introduced slowly, one at a time. We don't know if he has lived with cats, but tends to be unengaged with the ones he has seen. He is a quiet boy who rarely barks.\n\nLight appears to be house trained and crate trained, so he has had some training. He does need some work on his leash skills as he initially bucks but he will eventually settle and walk calmly.\n\nLight needs an adopter who is committed to keeping his world small until he starts to settle in. The adopter should plan to limit visitors to his home, leave the dog at home (crated - not loose!) rather than taking him to parties, soccer games, dog parks, etc, and focus on building a bond through structure and moderate obedience training. A fenced yard would be ideal so he could run and play safely, but if that's not available he'll need lots of leash walks and opportunities for off-leash play in a fenced area.\n\nLight a gentle happy boy who just wants a loving forever home. Can you make his dream come true? Fill out an application today and let him know that you'd love to have him join your family!\n\nAdoption Fee: $585\n\nTo apply for this dog, fill out an adoption application on our website: www.sosarl.org/aa/\n\n**Additional info you should know - For most of our dogs, we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each of our dogs as an individual and do our best to describe and place them based on personality not breed label. Some dogs may not yet be in New England, nor ready for immediate adoption. There may be additional vetting, quarantine, waiting periods and/or fees depending upon your state of residence. If you have questions or concerns on any of this, you can discuss this with your Adoption Counselor.",

This litter came to us after their mama got hit by a car :-( they needed to be kept safe! They are little chihuahua mixes, just over 3 months old.\n\nThe puppies are full of life! There is never a dull moment with 6 puppies running around! They are very playful, sometimes rough but always ready for cuddles with their foster family. They live with other dogs of various sizes in their foster home and do well with everyone. They like the house cats too! Although they have not been exposed to kids while in rescue, we do not believe there will be an issue as long as the kids are kind and respectful of their small statures. Housetraining is still a skill in need of work - right now they use pee pads. One or two will venture outside into the snow but then quickly hightail it back inside! They love toys and chewies are a favorite. They are gated or penned at night and when their foster family is gone for the day. They still need training and that\n\nMoose is one of 3 boys and the biggest. And the biggest baby! He is very sensitive and will let you know if his feelings are hurt. He is a active little dog - he follows his foster mom everywhere. He learned stairs and still tells his foster mom every time he goes up and down lol. He goes outside with the 'big dogs' but doesn't really know why he's out there other then to play. Moose loves to be held and babied! This little boy is looking forward to a life time of being spoiled!\n\nMoose Tracks is neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccines, microchipped, flea/worm treated at the time. His adoption fee is $400",

I am super dog friendly and have plenty of puppy energy left to run around with doggy friends. I haven't been able to meet cats just yet, but they might not be thrilled with my zoomies. I'm also more than happy to be your couch buddy! After a long hard play session, there's nothing quite like a good roll in the dirt and belly rubs. One thing you should know about me is that I do have moderate skin allergies and might need prescription foods and medication in the future if I have flare ups, but I promise you I am well worth it! My coat already looks so much better than it did when I first got here. Give me the chance to crawl into your lap and into your heart!",

He's an affectionate one year-old Boxer/Catahoula mix who loves going for long walks and car rides with his favorite volunteers. At 70 pounds, Charlie is a large boy and can be quite a strong puller on walks. He loves playing with stuffed toys and can often be seen playing quietly in his kennel with his collection of toys. Charlie is a bit insecure meeting strangers but we have found with a proper introduction, he quickly becomes comfortable with new people. Although Charlie formerly lived with small dogs and cats, he does show some reactivity to dogs in our shelter environment. Several successful meet and greets would be required for any potential canine or feline siblings. If you would like to meet Charlie, please fill out an adoption application (no obligation) at www.satchelslastresort.org, and an adoption counselor will be in touch.",

He is being fostered with 2 older canine ladies and has been very respectful that maybe they don't want to rodeo as much as he does. There are cats in the home as well, that tend to stay in their own areas, but he has paid them little attention.

My goal for 2021 is to shed a couple pounds... I know, pretty basic. But I want to be fit for the rest of my days! So I am on a special diet to help me with this. I don't have history with other animals or children, but I'm open to new opportunities. I am heartworm positive, but don't worry! AHS covers the cost of my treatment, and a staff member can tell you more about this when you come in to meet me. I can't wait to see you!",

I am great with my doggie foster siblings. I do seem to be more comfortable and prefer the females though - not mean to the males, just think I like the ladies more! I would be just fine as an only in my new home or with a female that would play with me! I am housebroken and good in the crate. I am a young guy so will require some guidance and of course exercise; someone who understands my breed is a plus. I am a cuddly big dude who really loves his people and would make a great addition to an adult home; I have some spent some time with younger kids but can be big and a little jumpy so might knock down little ones; school-aged kids might appreciate me more!   ASCZ has no idea on how I would be with a cat so likely that isn't the best idea! :) Please email erin@asecondchnaceforziva.com for more info on handsome me!\n\n\n*********************************************************************************\nA Second Chance for Ziva, Inc.

Scroll thru description for preferred contact info!!\nAdditionally for CATS you may email latkinson@eulesstx.gov and for DOGS, email trinitygapclub@gmail.com\n\nSay Hello to Oreo! A sweet and smart Pit Bull/Cattle Dog mix, Oreo is a very high energy girl that will thrive in an active environment that allows her the room and time to run/jump/play. At approximately 9 months of age, she weighs in the 35lb.-40 lb. range. Looking for a buddy to chase outdoors, play tug of war, or just snuggle? She's your girl! Oreo is making good progress on leash/kennel/potty training. She is spayed, heartworm negative, and current on vaccinations. Because of her size, strength, and enthusiasm level (she greets with a body wag and a tail wag), Oreo will do best with other dogs who have her same energy level and size range. She is not good with cats or smaller dogs. Oreo's new home must have a secure 6ft. wooden fence. She does love her humans, and is best suited for a home with a pet parents who have experience with her breed(s)/similar breeds and children over the age of 14 (no small children). For more information on Oreo, please contact gapfosterfriday@gmail.com",

She is a Walker Coonhound and is believed to be around six-years-old. Daisy loves the outdoors and seems to know her way around the woods quite well which is typical for her breed. She does not seem reactive to other dogs but due to her past we are not sure how she would do living with one. She is definitely not a fan of cats and has no problem speaking her voice about them with her deep howl.\nDaisy arrived at our shelter VERY pregnant and gave birth to 10 beautiful puppies. She was a great Mom and now it's her turn to find her forever home with a great family who understands (and loves) her breed!Please visit the following link on our website to learn about Second Chance's adoption process. http://www.2ndchanceanimalcenter.org/adoption.html",

Earl does great with dogs big and small. He currently lives in a house with cats, the kitties tend to stay away, and he has shown minimal interest. Earl has lots of playful energy so will do best with a dog that has similar energy, and because he is a shyguy, a confident dog will do best to help him build his confidence. Earl needs a fenced in yard (he is a little shy about going potty on a leash). As for his humans, someone patient to get him through his shy times, and as you can see in his pictures, someone ok with him truly believing he is a 60+ lb lapdog.",

She's housebroken, walks well on the leash and knows basic commands. She's a low-key girl...if not lazy! She loves attention, especially belly rubs, but is happy to just hang out next to her human all day. What a perfect sweetheart!\n\nKatarina has typical Shepherd tendencies and can be protective of her human, so she would probably do best as an only dog.

IF YOU APPLY and if WE APPROVE YOU it means we are assuming when you meet any of our dogs and fall in love you're ready to ADOPT AND HIM OR HER HO\nCuddly, CottonBall CAYLEE has come to DASH ready for her Forever Family to find them!\nCAYLEE is a gentle, loving and CALM breed mix 13 weeks old and 19 lbs; she will be a large dog but NOT a giant when full-grown, maybe 60 lbs, and she appears to have the BEST traits from a Husky/\"Winter Breed\" with the much lower shedding, tightly-woven fur of a Pyrenees.\nCAYLEE LOVES TO PLAY indoors and out as she's always had her brother as a built-in playmate - however she is happy to play with any gentle large dog and can run & roll around the yard in the sun a couple of hours as long as she has a playmate.\nOn the flip side she is also EXTREMELY well-behaved indoors. She wants to follows her humans and our other dogs around the house and can flop down with one of us to relax and snooze. Much calmer than most young puppies but healthy and lively and acclimating to whatever environments she has been in.\nCAYLEE is crate-trained but doesn't love the crate until she's worn-out, but she's also been AMAZING with house-breaking and can sleep all night without needing to be restricted as long as she sticks to her feeding schedule and gets several chances to be let outdoors for a few minutes.\nIf you're interested in meeting this lovable white, fluffy, cotton-ball of sweetness and softness please complete our application on our site listed below then text Sara at 214-549-9905 so I can review your application!\nwww.dashdog.org\n\nGeneral Info - PLEASE READ! *Our $350 adoption fee is based on the cost of rescuing, transporting and vetting each dog; we do not try to compete on prices with municipal shelters whose funds are paid by the city. Our philosophy is to rescue highly adoptable dogs, have them live kennel-free in private homes for temperament assessments and individual personalities.\nWe work hard to match EACH dog with the right family - kids or no kids, other dogs male or female and/or cats. With very rare exceptions all dogs over 6 months will be spayed or neutered PRIOR to adoption - dogs under 6 months will include a spay/neuter date AND referral info for lower-cost surgery if the adopter does not choose to use her or his personal vet. OUR VETS WILL NOT PERFORM SPAY NEUTER SURGERIES UNTIL DOG IS 6 MONTHS OLD.\n\nPlease READ ALL of our info below BEFORE SENDING APPLICATION.\n\nOur goal is to help our puppies and dogs find FOREVER HOMES AND FAMILIES, NOT TO MAKE IT PROHIBITIVE FOR YOU TO ADOPT. However, once we review the application and contact you, we MEET TO ADOPT, so please let us know if you are ONLY APPLYING TO STAY ON FILE or THAT YOU ARE READY TO ADOPT, for the consideration of our puppies and dogs and families who know the time is right!\n\nGeneral Info - PLEASE READ!

            "description": "Meet Pam!  This sweet little beagle is about 9 months old and is looking for her furever family.  Pam is dog social but likes to be the boss of her canine companions, so she needs friends who will tolerate her outgoing nature. She is sweet and loves being around both people and dogs. Pam is very interested in cats but is good as long as they are tolerant of a dog being in their business. Pam is very active and would love a fenced yard so she can spend lots of time running and exploring. She will find a toy and spend hours flinging it around the yard then pouncing on it. Being a true Beagle, her nose tells her where she\u2019s going so she wouldn\u2019t do well without a fence. \n\nPam will require someone who is basically always home or takes her everywhere as she has severe separation anxiety. A family where everyone works away from home or leaves her home alone for long periods is not a good match for Pam. She has learned to be independent when her foster family takes short trips away from the house, but she needs food puzzles and a Furbo to stay busy.  And she really responds to praise for good behavior after her family makes a quick trip to the store.\n\nPam knows that she has some special requirements and it might take time for her to find the perfect home.  But, if someone will give her the chance, she promises to be a loving companion and shower her new family in beagle antics for years to come.  If you would like more information on adding Pam to your pack, please contact her adoption consultant, Kelly, at Kelgirl1077@yahoo.com  Pam can\u2019t wait to meet you!",
