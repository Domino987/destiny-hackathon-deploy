He would love a fenced in back yard to follow his nose around. He loves to snuggle and goof around. Murphy rides nicely in the car. Murphy knows sit, stay, up, come and we are working on shake and lay down. He walks nicely on a leash using a Gentle Leader Head Halter. Murphy has completed 7 days of basic training with United Paws Dog Training. Murphy will require a home with experienced dog owners that can keep him active and out of trouble. He is a very high energy dog and needs to keep his mind busy and focused. He is dog friendly but unknown to cats. Since his energy level is so high, we would recommend a home with children 10 and older. *He also would love a back yard with a 6 foot fence.",

I live for affection, and look forward to any tummy scratches I can get! I have a fairly moderate energy level for a dog my size. I am very well mannered, but a strong walker on a leash. I will definitely need a little bit of leash training with my new family. \n\nI absolutely adore people, and can be iffy with some dogs. I have a tendency to resource guard with other dogs, so I will absolutely need to be the only dog in the household.\n\n Because of my size and strength, I will not be able to go home with a family who has children under the age of 10. I know my basic commands, and again, will probably benefit from some training. I am housebroken, and looking for a place to call home. If you think you could be my person, please give the nice folks at MaxFund a call at 303-595-4917 so I can meet you!\n\n**Because I am a pure bred Great Dane, my adoption fee will be $250**\n\n\nMaxFund is a physical shelter located at 1005 Galapago St in Denver, Colorado.\nIf you are interested in learning more about a dog, please call 303-595-4917 to make an appointment\n\nThis PetFinder account is managed by volunteers, and the most up-to-date information is at the shelter.\nHow our adoption process works:\n1. You MUST come into the shelter to meet a dog you are interested in (and meet a few others, while you\u2019re at it!)\n                              Our hours are 10-5 Mon, Wed, Thu Fri / 11-5 Saturday / 12-5 Sunday\n                We suggest you call ahead to be sure the dog(s) do not have pending applications\n2. You will fill out your adoption application, including references, after finding a dog you\u2019d like to adopt\n3. The application review and reference checks will take up to 3-5 business days; you will not be able to bring a dog home same-day\n                We only take 2 applications per dog, before they are unavailable. This is why we suggest you call ahead to check the status of the pup!\n \nWe do not adopt out-of-state.\nThank you for choosing to rescue!",

            "description": "Meet Apollo! He is a 25 lbs, 1 year old dog who is maybe the cutest dog you've ever seen and maybe a Corgi. Admittedly, we have no idea if he's actually a Corgi mix but he's got the short stubby legs of a Corgi, he excels at \"splooting\" said stubby legs, he has the energy of a herding dog. Here are the top facts you need to know about Apollo straight from his foster mom:\n\n-Apollo LOVES to play with other dogs. He plays hard and could spend all day wrestling, playing tug and running zoomies with another playful dog.\n-Apollo is very cat friendly! He lives with a cat currently and is excellent with her.\n-Apollo is very outgoing and social with people. He hasn't been around kids yet. We think he'd be fine with kids but he doesn't have many manners yet (puppy life) so he'll need some training.\n-Apollo is mostly housebroken but he needs go to outside to potty about once per hour if he is outside of his kennel. If he doesn't get out to potty on the hour, he will still have some pee accidents inside. This is pretty easy to manage in a home with a fenced in yard but not so easy to manage in an apartment.\n-Apollo is excellent in a crate! He stays in his crate while his foster family is at work and at bedtime and he is perfectly well behaved while kenneled.\n-Apollo is the most fun dog ever and has the funniest personality!\n\n\nIf you're interested in meeting Apollo, please visit our website to learn about our adoption process and to fill out an application, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs and cats will be micro-chipped, spayed or neutered, and up-to-date on vaccinations at the time of adoption. For more photos of Apollo, follow us on Facebook Gateway Pet Guardians and Instagram @gatewaypets ... #gpgApollo\n\nTo view other adoptable pets from our shelter, please visit, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nGateway Pet Guardians is proud to offer a variety of mixed breed dogs available for adoption. However, please keep in mind that we rarely know the genetic background of the animals we rescue and, as such, we cannot guarantee the exact breed combinations found within this dog. However, we do not know his/her actual genetic makeup. Just know that this dog is probably a variety of several different breeds that have combined to create one very amazing and unique animal.",

To meet BRUTUS, see the contact information below.\n\nBrutus is a beautiful, sweet 1-year-old Shepherd/Akita mix who was rescued off the streets of Tijuana.  He is a lot of dog, but in a good way. Brutus is a neutered male and weighs about 75 lbs. \n\nHe is very inquisitive, eager to learn, and ready for fun. He is calm, playful, and loving, yet protective.  He gets along well with other dogs and people. Brutus is housetrained and knows how to use a doggie door. He would be great with an individual or family who is active. He is ready to learn new things and he loves to ride in the car.  \n\nIn addition to being neutered, Brutus has been wormed, microchipped, and is up-to-date with his Distemper/Parvo, Bordetella, and Rabies shots. He has been given Nexgard flea treatment.  \n\nAn application for adoption will be requested, along with a video of your yard. There is a rehoming fee, and medical records will be provided. To meet Brutus, email, call, or text his foster mom: Pam.Lawless@gcccd.edu; 619.964.1181.\n",

Mom is best thought to be a lab mix, and we are unsure of the father.\n      Best thought is they will be medium sized. All have had their 1st round of vaccines and  will be ready for their forever home February 5th. The adoption fee is $400 plus WI tax. \n     \n\nSweetie will be spayed and microchipped upon adoption.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Sweetie, please fill out an application at luckypawsmidwest.org. Once your application is approved, we can set up a time for you to meet Sweetie!\n\nLucky Paws Midwest is licensed and inspected by the State of Wisconsin: 402655-DS",

All have had their 1st round of vaccines and  will be ready for their forever home February 5th. The adoption fee is $400 plus WI tax. \n     \n\nRose will be spayed and microchipped upon adoption.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Rose, please fill out an application at luckypawsmidwest.org.

Blake has no experience with livestock.\n\nTransport assistance may be available within a 1000 mile radius depending on where you live.  There may be transport options for points along the NE seaboard.  Please inquire for more information.\n\nEmail us to learn more about Blake asdrescue@gmail.com\n\nFor general adoption information on requirements , application and process please visit our website \nhttps://www.nasrn.com/info/adoption\n\n",

All have had their 1st round of vaccines and  will be ready for their forever home February 5th. The adoption fee is $400 plus WI tax. \n     \n\nLovebug will be neutered and microchipped upon adoption.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Lovebug, please fill out an application at luckypawsmidwest.org.

            "description": "Spot is a big, jolly fellow that always seems to be smiling! Once you get to know him he loves pets and the occasional snuggles. He will flop over for belly rubs and won't want you to stop! When outside he is in adventure mode and wants nothing more than to keep exploring. He enjoys getting the zoomies and playing outside just as much as the next dog but when push comes to shove, he'd rather spend his time relaxing and thinking about his next big adventure while playing with a toy. \n\nSpot came to Lollypop Farm because his previous home wasn't a good fit. During his time with us, Spot has shown that it can take a little time for him to call you his pal, but once he does you will be his new best friend! Spot isn't the biggest fan of sharing his toys or high value items but has been learning how to exchange items for treats or other items and he'd love to show you! \n\nThe recommendations for Spot's success is a home that has no children under the age of 14. He has a history living with another dog but we are unaware of how they interacted together. Since Spot takes a little more time to be comfortable with new people, it will require more than one visit before taking him home. \n \nIf you'd like to meet Spot you can set up an appointment with Gillian via email at gfralick@lollypop.org!",

And you will be happy to know that she is calm and gentle.\n\nBella is intelligent, active and affectionate. She loves to go for walks, and she's good on a leash. She LOVES all people and gets along well with other dogs.\n\nBella was rescued from a patio where she was left alone to fend for herself in the blaring heat of the Puerto Rico sun.\n\nWe heard about this bright, beautiful girl, and knew we had to help! She is now at our shelter in NH, looking for her forever family. She's confident, and absolutely wonderful with people.\n\nBella is about 1 year old, and she weighs 45 lbs. She is spayed, has all her required vaccines, and is microchipped.\n\nIf you'd like to open your heart and home to this BEAUTY-ful girl, please complete an adoption application at https://www.heartsandtails.org/adoption-application/\n\nPLEASE NOTE that due to the overwhelming number of inquiries we receive daily, we can only respond to those who have completed an online application, and appear to be a good match.

            "description": "Age: ~ 2 years (as of 01/20/21)\nWeight: 91.6 lbs (as of 01/20/21)\n\nThis dog has been spayed/neutered, is up to date on shots, on heartworm preventative and is microchipped.\n\nChloe is a big sweet girl!\n\nShe is also playful and smart. We are thinking this gorgeous girl is a Lab and Great Dane mix about 2 years old with a beautiful shinny coat.\n\nChloe is friendly with all of us humans including kids, but she is a big playful girl that may be too much for young children. She is sociable with other dogs but tends to prefer male doggies over females. We don't know if this is with all female dogs or selectively. She seems ok with cats and will track in a playful way. Chloe is pretty quiet but may alert bark to get your attention.\n\nShe has mainly been an outdoor dog and is not house trained or crate trained but have a feeling she will be a quick study as she is such an intelligent girl! A fenced yard would be ideal so she could run and play safely, but she does sometimes dig if left alone. If a fenced yard is not available, she'll need lots of leash walks and opportunities for off-leash play in a fenced area.\n\nA potential adopter should be prepared to give her regular exercise, a structured routine, work on socialization, and couple all of these things with lots of praise and treats! An obedience course is a must with Chloe; it will help teach her good manners and commands, further socialization with other dogs and people, and will help build that very important bond between a dog and her human.\n\nChloe a gentle happy girl who just wants a loving forever home. Can you make her dream come true? Fill out an application today and let her know that you'd love to have her join your family!\n\nMedical Note:\n\nThis dog tested positive for exposure to ehrlichia while in SOS foster care. This does not mean that this dog had ehrlichia. This dog is/has been asymptomatic while in SOS care and was preventatively treated with a 28-day course of doxycycline. Please see here for more information on ehrlichia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehrlichiosis_(canine). Please check with your vet if you should have any questions or concerns about this condition, and discuss any concerns you may have with your SOS Adoption Counselor.\n\nAdoption Fee: $585\n\nTo apply for this dog, fill out an adoption application on our website: www.sosarl.org/aa/\n\n**Additional info you should know - For most of our dogs, we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each of our dogs as an individual and do our best to describe and place them based on personality not breed label. Some dogs may not yet be in New England, nor ready for immediate adoption. There may be additional vetting, quarantine, waiting periods and/or fees depending upon your state of residence. If you have questions or concerns on any of this, you can discuss this with your Adoption Counselor.",

She gets along well with the resident dogs and loves to cuddle with her foster family (she really loves the kids that all know how to play with her so gently).\n\nShe is a teenie little thing but is all puppy and likes her chewy toys and bully sticks (with her people's supervision). Evie is available for pre-adoption and will be ready to go to her furever home in 7-10 days\n\nPlease remember, puppies need a lot of time, patience, love, structure and positive reinforcement. If you have that to give and want to meet Evie, please fill out an application!\n\nApplication available at https://www.pawsofloverescue.com/adoption-application. Adoption fee of $275 includes neuter/spay, microchip, heartworm testing, deworming, vaccinations, and other necessary procedures.

Even then he looks at you in a way that makes you doubt if you're right. He is fearful of most men so you will need to be patient with him. He is crate trained , will need a little work on signaling at the door for outside time. He loves cuddling when he finally slows down. Loves attention and playing with toys. He is very handsome but still needs training on manners. He walks good on a leash but is very powerful when walking . He wants to play with small dogs but at this time is too rough . He is all puppy all the time. Since he is an active pup, he needs a fenced in yard so he can run and play.\nHe is 45lb, up to date on vaccinations, heartworm negative, on prevention, neutered and microchipped. His adoption fee is $150\nApplications can be found on our website pcpoundpuppies.com\n***YOU MUST FILL OUT AN APPLICATION BEFORE WE DO ANY MEET AND GREETS. QUESTIONS?

            "description": "Midnight is a 12 year old spaniel mix. He's about 33 pounds, and he's looking for a very special home to love him for all of his days! Midnight is at the point in his life where he is well past the excitement that life with multiple animals and small children has to offer. An ideal home for him would be one without any hustle or bustle. He would love a home of his own where all of the attention is on him.\n\nThis handsome boy isn't just a couch potato, though! Sure, he enjoys the occasional Netflix binge and lazy Sunday morning like the rest of us, but at 12 years old he still has a spring in his step and a taste for adventure! He's lively and zippy and has such a funny personality that keeps us all entertained and laughing.\n\nMidnight's adoption fee is $195, and he is neutered, microchipped and current on all vaccines.\n\nWhat do you say? Are you in need of the love only Midnight can offer? We think so, too. Apply online today to adopt Midnight! Applications are available at www.partnersforpetsil.org/applications",

Mom is best thought to be a lab mix, and we are unsure of the father.\n      Best thought is they will be medium sized. All have had their 1st round of vaccines and  will be ready for their forever home February 5th. The adoption fee is $400 plus WI tax. \n     \n\nCuddles will be neutered and microchipped upon adoption.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Valentine, please fill out an application at luckypawsmidwest.org. Once your application is approved, we can set up a time for you to meet Cuddles!\n\nLucky Paws Midwest is licensed and inspected by the State of Wisconsin: 402655-DS",

            "description": "Finn is a beautiful 2 to 3 year old, & 45lb Beagle/Yellow Lab mix, according to the Texas vets. (This is just an educated guess, he probably has multiple breeds in him!) with all the traits that make these super- smart and personality-plus dogs very popular breed mixes for families and individuals searching for loving and loyal best friends. Finn was found as a stray in Texas and has been staying with a foster until he comes to Colorado to find his forever home. \n\nThe following is from his foster: \n\u201cOh, my sweetest foster I\u2019ve had! He is a beautiful lab/Beagle mix. He looks like butter and this boy will melt your heart!  He loves all people, all dogs, all children! He is not a cuddler but loves attention and getting pets. He is crate trained, house trained, and sleeps through night without any problem. He goes right out to pee and does his business in the privacy of the bushes. A true gentleman. He is not aggressive at all with food and really never acts too hungry. He loves to play in the hose and is not afraid of  water. That\u2019s the lab in him. Now for the other breeds in him - besides his mottled tongue and curled up tail. He is always looking for cats, birds, and squirrels in trees when outside. He marks his territory often (outside only, luckily) but has not peed on a thing inside my house! He does nicely on the leash and does NOT pull my arm out of it's socket! He smiles to greet me after I have left him in his crate and genuinely likes everything! Not needy! I have not tried leaving him in my house without a crate.  He loves a car ride and jumps right in and stays in the back of the car without any problem. I\u2019ve seen no chewing. He adores chasing tennis balls. He has lots of strong energy but uses it well. It\u2019s EASY to love this buttery boy!\u201d\n\nWhile Finn will be initially shy when he arrives on transport in Colorado, a bit of time, kindness and yummy treats will quickly bring this guy out of his shell. We know that this sweet dog enjoys his time with his Texas foster dad and mom tremendously.. his favorite times of the day are the times spent together. When he arrived at their home, however, he was frightened and just a bit watchful. With some time to sort things out, Finn was quickly a lover.. and ultimately a best friend. His foster is very clear that this gorgeous guy is over the top sweet, a bit shy at first.. but once comfortable,..the most loving guy ever!\n\nFarfel's Rescue would like to see Finn in a home where he'll get consistent mental stimulation, exercise and tons of loving hugs. A positive reinforcement/force free group training class promotes great behavior, bonding and confidence for a young guy whose self-esteem will fly high while he masters his skills. Farfel's feels so strongly about a training opportunity for all dogs that we're unwilling to adopt to a family that doesn't choose to give Finn this opportunity. Farfel's is happy to provide a list of approved positive reinforcement/force free trainers in your area.\n\nFinn will be arriving on transport in Denver on Wednesday 2/3/2021. We're currently searching for a very loving, nurturing and committed family for our wonderful Finn. Applications are being accepted for this loyal and devoted best friend and can be found at http://farfels.com/farfels-rescue/adoption-form/. If interested, please fill out completely and submit.\n\n**PLEASE NOTE** Farfel's Rescue makes serious efforts to place our dogs with families that are excellent matches. We do this through our Farfel's Rescue application found at the link above or at farfels.com (never through rescue site apps such as Adoptapet or Petfinder as they don't provide enough information). If you're truly interested in adopting Finn please be sure to fill out the Farfel's Rescue adoption application. It's the only initial tool that we have to determine a great match for this very deserving guy. We're sorry, but in most cases, we're unable to get back to those that don't submit a Farfel's Rescue application. Thanks very much for choosing rescue.\n",

Merlin has suffered some mistreatment in his life and did find himself in a male dog aggressive environment.  He has carried that programming with him, though he was just neutered on January 20, 2021.  \n\nShots, worming and vet care provided by Ozark Haven Rescue thus his adoption donation will be provided directly to them as well.\n\nMerlin does well with smaller dogs, female dogs, neutered dogs, most cats and livestock..  He is totally housebroken, leash trained, crate trained and tends towards territorialism.  \n\nMerlin is pretty crafty with finding weaknesses in common fenced yards.  A safety plan for him and the neighborhood is required.  \n\nAn ideal home for Merlin would be Boxer experienced empty nesters with a strong vet and training history with the breed or other powerful breeds.  A healthy respect is mandatory for this magnificent beast!   Apartment dwellers welcome and a work from home jogger would be awesome!!!\n\nIn the right home Merlin will flourish and share years and years of love and companionship!\n\n",

            "description": "Rocco is a typical Chihuahua. He is very fearful at first. All he needs is some time to get to know you. He would do better in an adult home without any small children. Rocco is not friendly when he meets new people but with calm and baby talk, you can win him over in a few minutes, Rocco is a cuddler who enjoys sitting on the sofa with you or just cuddles next to you in bed. \n\nHe would make the perfect quarantine partner for someone who is looking for a loving Chihuahua. He walks well on the leash. He does well with other big or little calm dogs. He can be a bit possessive of his human but that is typical behavior of a Chihuahua who loves his owners. Rocco really enjoy going out in the yard and taking in that sun. Rocco doesn't like loud noise or loud people so keep in mind, he needs a soft spoken family who is willing to share their loving home with this perfect little Chihuahua. \n\nRocco is neutered, microchipped, frontline, heartworm negative, fully vetted and just got a dental. His adoption fee is $500. \nBroward County and West Palm Beach Adoption ONLY! No out of state adoptions. If you are interested for a meet and greet, you must fill out an adoption application FIRST. (Absolutely no exceptions) Apply here: https://naiasrescue.org/ or contact (786) 263-8323 or email naiaspetrescue@gmail.com",

Ellie is past the puppy rambunctious stage and the perfect age for someone that is looking for a beach walking partner. She is good with other calm dogs and cats, we have no information on how she is with small children. She is great on car rides and loves to go on walks\u2026and is a fantastic snuggler! \nEllie was left at a local vet clinic for boarding..and her owner never came back for her. We can\u2019t understand how someone could walk away from such a sweet and loving girl\u2026but we aren\u2019t going to focus on that anymore. We happily took her in to rescue to find her real forever home. Elllie deserves the best and we will make sure she gets it!\n",

He is about 2-3 years old, current on shots, neutered, and microchipped. He relates very well with other dogs and ignores cats. As with all of our rescues, we require a fenced-in yard, and a home visit prior to adoption. On the day of the agreed-upon date for the home visit, we will bring Peter with us. We will be wearing a mask and hand gloves to protect you as well as ourselves. The meeting will take place in your backyard. We only accept two applications per dog. We evaluate both applicants prior to determining who in our opinion is the best fit. If interested please complete and submit the dog adoption application available on this site. No exceptions to the FENCED-IN-YARD requirement will be entertained.",

Overall, he is a well rounded pup and his hazel eyes and chocolate coat will win your heart!\"\n\nRead through our adoption process and other adoption FAQs here www.rescueinc.dog/FAQs\n\nAll of our pups come with the following: \n\n\n\tSpayed or Neutered\n\tAge appropriate vaccinations + dewormed + 4DX test (if older than 6 months)\n\tNew martingale collar with 6' lead + temp ID tag\n\t30 days free insurance to be activated within 24 hours of your wellness visit with your veterinarian\n\tMicrochip with free registration for your new pup, but also for any other pets in your household too!\n\tSouthern pups, younger than 6 months, come with 1 month of flea / tick / heartworm prevention to prevent any lapse of protection \n\tOur southern dogs, 6 months and older, come with a **Proheart 6 injection which provides 6 months of Heartworm protection (approx value of $100) + dose of flea / tick preventative\n\n\n**dogs surrendered to us in MA do not recieve the Proheart 6 injection but do go home with 1 month of flea / tick / heartworm preventative so there is no lapse in protection\n\nAges listed can be approximate and breed mixes are a best guess based on physical characteristics. \n\nIf you are seeing this listing on Petfinder, please apply through the link on our website at www.rescueinc.dog/adopt \n\nPlease do not email with questions or message through Petfinder. Communication with the rescue always starts with submitting an application. \n\nIf you see this listing, the pup is still available. We pull listings after 2 to 3 viable applications are submitted.",

All have had their 1st round of vaccines and\u00a0 will be ready for their forever home February 5th. The adoption fee is $400 plus WI tax.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If you are looking to add one of these sweet babies as a new four legged family member please complete an application at luckypawsmidwest.org. Meetings will only be scheduled with an approved application. \n\nHugs will be neutered and microchipped upon adoption.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Hugs, please fill out an application at luckypawsmidwest.org.

If you are outside this area, we will not process your application.\n\nApproximate Age:\n\n~1 year old\n\nApproximate Weight/Size:\n\nSmall\n\nGood with:\n\nDogs\n\nNot tested with:\n\nKids, Cats\n\nHi, I'm Simon! I'm an easygoing pup who loves being inside with the humans I love. I don't really like going on walks -- I prefer to go in and out and then come back inside to get nice and warm on the sofa. I would love a quiet home where I can be with my family often. Maybe a nice home with a retiree where I'm not left alone often. I just want to snuggle and get pets and I can't wait to find a forever home where I can share all the love I've got to give!\n\nAdoption Application:\n\nhttp://bit.ly/adoptrdr\n\nAdoption Application:\nhttp://bit.ly/adoptrdr\n\nFoster Application: http://bit.ly/fosterapprdr\n\nAdoption Process: In order to adopt, we require an adoption application. After you submit an application, if you pass the screening, we will contact you to schedule a phone interview. We will call your references, including your veterinarian and landlord (when appropriate). We will also conduct a home visit. After these steps are complete, you will be approved to adopt a dog. Please note this process takes 1-2 weeks so applications submitted when you are ready to bring a dog home within that time frame. You can meet our adoptable dogs at events, however, we cannot guarantee that dogs at events do not have pre-approved applicants meeting them there as well, so the application is the best way to start the process.\n\nMission Statement: Forever true to \"The Underdog\", Rural Dog Rescue is dedicated to saving the lives of dogs in shelters who are often overlooked for adoption or rescue. We save the dogs who are at most risk of being euthanized: the hounds, the black dogs, the seniors, the sick and the broken. We make a commitment to reserve a minimum of 50% of the dogs we save to The Underdog. Root For The Underdog!\n\nRural Dog Rescue's home base is in Washington, DC. We adopt to the Washington, DC metropolitan area to include Maryland and Northern Virginia.\n\nWe support several high kill shelters that euthanize in 72 hours and whose kill rate is 70% or higher in rural areas of Virginia, West Virginia, North and South Carolina. Rural Dog Rescue also helps dogs in need in Washington, DC and Maryland.\n\nWe are 100% volunteer and foster based and no salaries are paid. 100% of your donation and adoption fee goes to helping the dogs and cats of Rural Dog Rescue.\n\nAlthough we try to be as accurate as possible, Rural Dog Rescue cannot guarantee the breed or full-grown adult size of any of the dogs or puppies in its care. Because many of these dogs were found as strays or are the result of irresponsible, unplanned breeding, we do not know the dog's exact background and can only list breed and size by our best educated guess. If exact breed and size are important to you, please consider adopting a dog from a specific breed rescue. Our goal is for our dogs to be adopted by people who will love and care for them forever for who they are - no matter what breed and size they turn out to be!\n\nAll dogs go to their new homes spayed or neutered, up to date on all shots, dewormed (although a second deworming may be required), started on heartworm and flea and tick preventative and sometimes microchipped.",

He loves playing with his toys and the big dogs, even though he is still a little afraid of how big they are. Renly is an adventurous boy with a lot of puppy energy.\n\nRenly is crate trained for overnight and potty pad trained but he is also working on traditional potty training now that he's old enough.\n\nRenly had an umbilical hernia when he was born that was corrected in rescue. He is the last puppy in his litter to be adoptable, which gave us more time to work on individual training with him.\n\nHe has black colored fur with a tiny white chest marking and super sweet puppy eyes. He was born in Missouri, to a black lab mom, his dad is most likely a husky that lived near by. The litter of pups were surrendered to rescue.\n\nRenly is 9 weeks old as of 1/31/21.\n\nHe is one of 8 puppies in his litter.\n\nHe hopes his next adventure is to find a forever family of his own!\n\nAdoption Fee: $495\n\nINTERESTED IN MEETING ME?\n\nIf you'd like to arrange a private meeting or begin the adoption process, please fill out an adoption application by visiting\n\nhttps://www.healingheartsrescue.org/adopt\n\n**Note on breed and age determination:\n\nBreed and age are often determined on appearance, our own knowledge, veterinarian advice, and/or information from the sending shelters or previous owners. Most of our adoptable dogs were previously stray dogs with little history, we can't be 100% sure of a dog's breed mix, and unless there is a specific date of birth listed, we can't be 100% sure of a dog's age. Additionally, our assessments of a dog's interactions with other dogs, cats, or children are based on OUR experiences. Your experience may differ.\n\nADOPTION FEE INCLUDES:\n\nWellness check\n\nSpay/neuter (puppies adopted with required spay/neuter certificate)\n\nAge appropriate vaccines - rabies as required by law and distemper combo or proof of positive titer test\n\nHeartworm test if over 7 months of age\n\nFecal test and/or deworming for parasites\n\nMicrochip\n\n\n\n~ Healing Hearts rescue will also provide dental procedures, bloodwork, surgeries, and/or any other additional vet work as needed while dogs are in our care.\n\n~ Adoption fees are non-negotiable and fees are listed on the dog's profile\n\n~ Adoption fees can be paid the following ways with the required sales tax (7.525%) added:\n\nPayPal\n\nCredit Card\n\nCash\n\nWANT TO HELP SAVE MORE DOGS?\n\nHealing Hearts Rescue is a nonprofit, foster-based rescue\n\nlocated in the Twin Cities area of Minnesota\n\nthat is 100% funded through adoption fees and donations\n\n.

I walk very well on a leash and love playing with my Foster siblings and my foster parents. I know how to sit, lay down, play fetch and am 100% potty trained.\n\nI sleep in a crate at night, and I prefer to free roam during the day. As long as I'm blocked off from getting into things I'm not supposed to and given toys, I can spent my afternoons outside of the crate.\n\nPlease visit our website for our adoption process & to complete an application- www.hoofwoofmeow.org (Knight's adoption fee is $350 plus $50 refundable neuter fee)\n\n(Please Note: Knight's neuter appointment is tentatively scheduled for 3/19 - so his adopter will need to be able to keep that appointment or work with our medical team to find an appointment that is sooner. Thank you!)",

What are the chances?\n\nMy name is Little Socks (probably the white socks on my feet). I'm a 2-year-old female (spayed) Dachshund mix but with pretty long legs. I weigh about 19-pounds, which means I'm not too small and not too big - I'm just right. And I have a gorgeous chocolate coat with the aforementioned white socks.\n\nWhy adopt me? Well, in addition to being really cute, I'm already house-trained, leash trained, and I'm great with everyone I meet (although I can be a little shy when I first meet you). Sounds like a slam-dunk to me.\n\nBut why just take my word for it. Come meet me and see for yourself. Complete an adoption application, and let's get this adoption started.\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online. http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.\n\nNote: Some apartments and neighborhoods have breed restrictions.

He was born in December 2020 and will be a med/large dog when fully grown. \n\nPlease note: as with most rescue puppies, we have no way to guarantee this puppy\u2019s breed or size potential. \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for puppies covers initial deworming,  puppy vaccinations, microchip, and spay/neuter at the rescue's approved vet at 6 months of age. Please see our website for more information.\n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq\n\n*Any breed labels used by Take Paws Rescue, its employees/volunteers, or on vet records provided cannot be guaranteed.  Breed labels are given based on information obtained during intake and/or best guesses based on appearance and/or temperament of the dogs and Take Paws Rescue gives no assurance to the accuracy of these labels. Labels are necessary for postings to many animal networking sites, such as Pet Finder, and are no way a guarantee. Additionally, exact age and potential size cannot be guaranteed.",

I am a one year old husky /mastiff mix (I'm told) and unfortunately looking for a new home.\nI had a great home, got a human sister, and things got ugly between my people. As loved as I am by my mom, she was forced to give me up for very personal reasons. I am hoping my new family will give her updates. I heard this will be allowed and welcomed.\n\nI am a big boy, and a very good boy. I'm very submissive, great with kids and other dogs. Due to Covid-19, sterilization will be done later, but for a non neutered male, I am great. I do however have one main issue : food allergies. If I get into anything not \"approved \" I will blotch out and get very itchy. \nI will have to live in a home that will be very strict with my diet. Right now, I am in rough shape as I got my mouth on some great stuff, but not for me. Duck is my food, and everything else is no good!\n\nI am gentle, but young, so energetic. I need some training on walks, greeting people and responding to commands. I'm just a big goof at heart.\n\nIf you think you're the ideal human (s) for me and understand what a huge commitment adopting a dog is, then please hurry on over to www.sophiesdogadoption.com and download the adoption form. DO NOT just write in asking if I'm still available. You'll lose precious time. If you can see this bio, it means I'm still available.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "description": "Oliver is a little senior boy who was surrendered to a shelter after their German Shepherd attacked and injured him. Though he seems fearful of people at first, he will warm up with patience and will then seek out affection. So an adoption meet and greet may not result in Oliver in your lap giving you kisses but it will happen in time.\n\nOnce he trusts you he will be on your lap giving kisses and will follow you around everywhere! His foster mom reports that he even allowed her to trim his nails for him. He's watchful of new people but is a sweetheart once he knows he is safe. He seems to enjoy having a dog friend to explore and relax with, but not a big player yet. This little guy enjoys the companionship of felines as well. Oliver would love to have a \"stay at home\" person. He walks great on a leash and loves to explore. Oliver crates well and is house trained. If you can offer Oliver a quiet, patient and loving home please apply to adopt!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Oliver, please complete an application at https://www.circle2rescue.com/dog-adoption-application/ The adoption fee of $259 includes the spay/neuter, vaccinations, deworming and microchip. \n\nPlease note, Circle 2 Rescue cannot guarantee the breed, composition or ages of our dogs as we usually have no history prior to them entering the rescue. We make every effort to ensure the dogs are healthy.",

Sweet Vicki is the mom to our \"V\" puppy litter (2 of which are being featured in this year's Puppy Bowl on Super Bowl Sunday). Vicki is a playful, adorable girl who will win your heart. Her foster mom says Vicki loves to play with the other 7 dogs in the foster home, enjoys running and digging in the yard and really enjoys toys. She comes right up and puts her paw on her foster mom's lap letting her know it's time for pets and cuddles. Vicki is up to date on vaccines, spayed and house and crate trained. She has been tested in a home with cats and didn't bother with them. Her foster mom thinks she would be fine with kids. She would love a home with a fenced yard and another dog to play with.

            "description": "*TO APPLY GO TO www.LuckyDogRefuge.com*\n\nOleander is the most stunning dog to ever grace Lucky Dog with her presence.  She's simply gorgeous.  She has a great personality and is dog friendly, but can be very vocal with her play, so she must be supervised so other dogs don't react negatively to her play.  She adores humans and attention and would do well with older children (over 15). She is the most fantastic walker and loves to get outside.  She would make an excellent hiking companion.  \n\nThis girl was found as a stray in Mississippi and is looking for her furever home so she never has to know the feeling of being unwanted again.  Please apply thru our website.  She is ready to go home as soon as possible! \n\n\n\nREAD THE FOLLOWING FOR INSTRUCTIONS ON SUBMITTING AN APPLICATION FOR THIS PET:\n\n- The first step towards adoption is to complete an adoption application, which can be found online at our website www.LuckyDogRefuge.com, under the \u201cApply Now\u201d tab \n\nor \n\nat https://forms.gle/LXKMKSnagxLSad668.\n\n- Do NOT use the Petfinder links or email to ask us about our adoptable dog listings - we do not always receive these messages and will not respond to them.\n\n- Please do not ask if a dog is still available - we do our best to update their status as quickly as possible. If a dog is listed for adoption, it means we have not yet approved an adopter and are still accepting applications.\n\n- PLEASE NOTE THAT ONLY APPROVED ADOPTERS WILL BE PERMITTED TO MEET OUR RESCUES.\n\nThanks for considering a rescue pup!",

He's had some hard times, but doesn't let that get him down. He is high energy and always up for a game of tug or a run around the yard but will also burrow under the blankets and take a snooze on the couch. With other dogs, he can be a bit too excited and forceful which has led to some scuffles but he is not aggressive towards them. He knows his manners but sometimes gets too excited and forgets them. He's fully house trained and crate trained and will let you know when he needs to go out. He loves to play with balls, especially squeaky ones, and will have a hard time deciding which ones he wants to play with.\n\nPlease Note: All dogs are posted until they are officially adopted. This dog may have other interested adopters in line. If you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application on our website at www.lasthopek9.org.\n\nQuestions? Please email adoptions@lasthopek9.org. For more photos, or information on upcoming adoption events where you can meet her, please go to www.lasthopek9.org or go to our Facebook page.

They are doing great in a foster home and use the pet doors. They love being inside and outside. They are playful and great with dogs of all sizes.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please complete an online application at www.cvrr.us\nDue to high demand we anticipate multiple applications for each dog. Our volunteers will review each submitted application, then contact the top 3 most appropriate ones by either email or phone. Calling or emailing us to see if you are being considered will not expedite the process. If you have been selected for an interview we will contact you within 48 hours of submission. Thanks for your patience.\n\nMany of our dogs can be seen at Petsmart in Visalia on Saturdays between 10 and 3.Update: until restrictions are lifted we are unable to take dogs to PetSmart.",

He\u2019s got puppy fur and a little puppy cry and gobs of puppy skin care and still hasn\u2019t figured out his legs.\n.\n\nHe\u2019s getting a hang of sit. Not fuuully potty trained yet but definitely prefers to go outside, which is as much our error as his.  He is the snuggliest and highly food motivated. He does not yet understand his size. He doesn\u2019t have restraint because he is a pup and just has no concept of how huge he is. He\u2019s not awesome at stairs yet, but will practice 10-15 times over and over. He\u2019s incredibly smart and a good listener. He wants the cats to play with him but backs up when they refuse. He\u2019s still pretty humpy but it\u2019s less and less every day. He\u2019s been good in his crate when we\u2019ve had to leave him.\n\n\nAbove all else he\u2019s increeeedibly lovable. He\u2019s a big cuddly dope who just wants to snuggle up and hang out. He\u2019s gonna bond so quickly to someone.",

            "description": "Meet lovable HENRY. Henry came to us as a stray, so that means we don\u2019t have any history on him.  We can tell you he has been lovable here with us and seems to like all the dogs and has been uninterested in our shelter office cat.  He is a big strong boy who will pull you on the leash.  He needs work on that as well as house training & general obedience, just like any new dog you\u2019d bring into your life.  He will give you kisses because that\u2019s the kind of love bucket he is. \n\nWe guesstimate he is about 2 yrs old. He weighs about 70 lbs.   He is handsome without a doubt. He would add joy to someone\u2019s life and is wishing for loving humans, a safe indoor home with a safe place to go potty where he wouldn\u2019t get lost ever ever again. \n\nHenry is sponsored! His adoption fee is $50, fully vetted.  Visitors welcomed Tuesday - Saturday 11AM - 3PM. Appointments not needed, but please bring your masks to wear. Adoption applications available at the shelter after you 've visited and if you've made a love connection. \n\n\n*****\nIf don't have room in your home but do have room in your heart, you can help one of our homeless pets find a home of its own by sponsoring them. By sponsoring, you will be paying part of the adoption fee, making it possible for them to be adopted much sooner. \n            \nFor Adoption or Sponsorship  Information please call 270-586-3125.  \nADOPTION HOURS:  Tuesday - Saturday 11 am to 3 pm Central Time. Adoption Fee for our dogs is $95.  All dogs will be adopted fully vetted.  Spay/Neuter.  Wormed.  Heartworm tested and heartworm preventative administered.   Upon adoption, monthly preventative medications are available at a discounted rate.  \n",

            "description": "YOU MUST HAVE AN APPROVED APPLICATION IN ORDER TO MEET OUR PETS.\n\nAngel is a sweet approximately 13 year old senior looking for a retirement home.  She was pulled from a local shelter after being found as a stray.  She was an overweight 62 pounds and could barely walk.  Since being in her foster home, she has lost some weight and is moving around much better though she needs to lose more.  Her ideal weight is probably around 52 pounds.\n\nWe do not know her breed mix, maybe Lab/Cattle Dog/Corgi in the blend??\n\nAngel gets along with other dogs but can get a little over excited so another calm dog should be fine in her new home.  She does not move fast so any dog can easily get away from her if needed.\n\nShe seems to be house trained and will bark (howl) when she needs to go out.  \n\nShe sleeps a lot but does still enjoy playing with toys.\n\nShe loves to lie in the sun and wander around a fenced yard. She does like to take short walks but has a very slow, toddling walk.\n\nNaturally, since she is a senior, Angel has some manageable medical issues. She may have old cruciate tears in both knees and arthritis. She is on Gabapentin, Ostifen and ArthriEase Gold tablets.  She has a small eyelid mass and takes medications for conjunctivitis.  Her eye lenses are cloudy, but she seems to be able to see everything she needs to see just fine. She came to us with flea allergy dermatitis but her hair is growing back now that she is flea free.  Her foster family is giving her omega oils and high quality food. She has a few typical old dog fatty tumors, not a problem. She has some rectal cysts but surgery to biopsy and remove those would be a very hard and painful recovery with a high risk of infection and painful bowel movements so we decided to just leave those alone.  Foster mom puts a little pumpkin in her morning meal to soften her stools.\n\nAngel needs a one story house and cannot walk up more than one stair. Her foster family built her a little ramp to get into the house.\n\nAdoption donation $125.\n\n\nPlease note that we do not ship animals. We also require a home visit before finalizing any adoptions so preference is given to applicants within a 90 mile range. You will be required to come to High Point, NC to meet/pick up your new pet.\n\nHOW TO APPLY:\n1. Go to www.lovingpetinnadoptions.org\n2. Click on the \"Adoption Application\" link on the left side of the page.\n3. The application will open as a PDF and you should have the ability to fill it in from that page. Be sure to complete all fields.\n4. Save the application to your computer, then attach in an email and send to petprojectnc@gmail.com\n5. Someone will review your application as soon as possible, usually within 24 hours, and will be in touch with next steps.\n",

She has been trained in basic obedience and with a little bit of reminders will happily show off her skills. She loves to learn, aims to please, and has some extreme athleticism and would make a fun agility or flying disc dog. Don't let her athleticism fool you, this girl can couch potato with the best of them. She self entertains with bones during the day while her foster mom works from home, and is ready to lounge on the couch if it's too rainy for a walk. She wants nothing more than to be your everywhere sidekick but during times that she can't tag along, she crates up on command. Jazz would truly make an excellent addition to any home.",

We gave her this name to help her self-confidence. She is a retired breeder mama. Adira is 2 year old/50lbs English BullGirl given up to a vets office who turned her over to our rescue. Her spirit has been hurt by her previous people, but her playful loving personality still pops out occasionally. She will play with her toys and then looks around to make sure she is allowed to have fun. She will run in the fenced yard galloping like a horse then suddenly stops to hide as if she thinks she shouldn\u2019t act happy! More and more she is opening to human love and her personality is starting to shine. She is absolutely loving and becoming more confident. She is puppy playful and has some puppy behavior she is working on. Adira weighs almost 50 lbs. She is very shy and timid so an adult home would be better suited for her needs. She needs a home where they will show her it's ok to trust and be loved. Loud noises scare her so soft-spoken people would be best. Adira does seem to like women better than men, only cowering to men she does not react, just tries to make herself as small as possible, covering her eyes. She will need some guidance, love, and patience in order for her to come out of her shell.\n\nShe needs a home with people who have experience with English bulldogs, understand all their breed characteristics and health concerns. She is healthy now but may have allergies or breathing issues in the future. We just want people to be prepared long term. She is good with smaller dogs and some taller dogs but she really prefers to be the only dog to ensure her feelings of safety. She does guard her food from other dogs so feeding separately would be necessary if you have another dog.\n\nThis dog's adoption fee is $900 to go towards their vetting (vaccines, spay/neuter, heartworm/Ehrlichia/Lyme test, fecal test, pre-op blood work, dental cleaning, and microchip as well as grooming if needed). \n\nIf you are interested please fill out the adoption application For additional information regarding our adoption process or for a meet and greet, you must fill out an adoption application FIRST. Apply here: https://www.getalifepetrescue.com/\nor you can call 954-629-2445 or email info@getalifepetrescue.com\n",

She is such a happy puppy- ready to adventure or just chill if that's what's going on at the moment. She likes to get her wiggles out by playing fetch in the backyard or running laps with her brother. Tilly will never say no to a friendly wrestling match too! She likes to chew on toys to pass the time away and is a professional napper. \u00a0Tilly is highly social and the life of the party. She's good with a butt and tail jiggle to greet you as you come home. She's curious in all the right ways and is a quick learner. Tilly loves to be where the action is and playing outside. When it's time to relax, she loves to cuddle up on the sofa and extra bonus if someones getting work done on the computer next to her!

They were deeply loved pets who needed to find a new home after both of their owners passed away.\n\nABOUT:\nSnickers and Luci have spent their entire lives together, we will require that they be adopted together as a bonded pair. Snickers is very friendly with people and is sooo happy when her fosters return from their day away and even sings a little \u201chappy song\u201d to show her excitement.   She whines a little bit when they leave, but eventually settles in and (probably) naps the day away while she waits. Snickers and Luci enjoy the occasional play session together but are generally low energy dogs.  Snickers and Luci would probably love to snuggle up in their foster\u2019s bed, but they are content to share a bed on the floor.  Snickers and Luci  are very friendly with people and are being fostered with a teenager.  Snickers has fur that will require regular grooming appointments to keep it trimmed and clean.\n\nSnickers and Luci are two easy going, well behaved girls who will make great companions for their new family.  They will be good girls while you are gone, they will be happy to see you when you are home, and they\u2019re content to entertain themselves (with naps) when you\u2019re busy. \n\nInterested in adding one of our adoptables to your family?  More information and our adoption application can be found at www.luluslockerrescue.org.\n",

He\u2019s currently living with a foster family that runs a doggy daycare, so he\u2019s well socialized. Ollie loves all the dogs and people he meets. He loves play time, but when he gets tired he finds his favorite spot on a large dog bed and takes a break from the action. He\u2019s doing great with his potty training. Ollie sits by the sliding door, and even lets out a bark once in a while to let his fosters know he needs to go outside. At the end of the day he\u2019s ready for bed, and he has no problem sleeping through the night. This little guy is going to be a joy for his forever family!\nIf you would like to meet Ollie, please visit spotslaststop.org and fill out an application.\n",

It was clear that for quality of life, it had to be removed. It weighed 2 lbs. She had a literal weight lifted off her and she started her new lease on life. Pathology reports came back and were our worst fears- mast cell cancer. Lucy is considered a hospice case due to her age and the nature of mast cell BUT with her spunky attitude and penchant for long conversations with her humans, we know she will thoroughly enjoy the time she has left. \n\nLucy is looking for someone who won\u2019t mind a free loader who likes to sleep in. Someone with good food and who will listen to her great  stories. She loves to have conversations! Someone who will help her make and complete her bucket list. Is it you?\n\nFor more info text Courtney at 847-274-4240 or email us at care@pawsandaffectrescue.org \n",

They were deeply loved pets who needed to find a new home after both of their owners passed away.\n\nABOUT:\nLuci and Snickers have spent their entire lives together, we will require that they be adopted together as a bonded pair.  Luci\u2019s foster home says she loves to be pet and has the softest fur to make it even more enjoyable.  Luci will sit on your lap and eat up your attention as long as you let her.  She is overall a low energy dog and is content to spend the workday alone napping, but is very happy and excited when her fosters get home.  Luci and Snickers would probably love to snuggle up in their foster\u2019s bed, but they are content to share a bed on the floor.  Luci and Snickers are very friendly with people and are being fostered with a teenager.  Luci likes to herd on occasion, so any dogs that she would live with would need to be very tolerant of this behavior, their ideal home would have no other dogs.  We also do not think she would be appropriate to live with children who are too young to understand this herding behavior.  Younger, supervised visitors would be appropriate.  We do not know how Luci and Snickers are with cats, but because Luci likes to herd we would not feel comfortable adopting them to homes with cats.  Luci and Snickers have a fenced yard and do really well with that option.  Her foster home in Louisiana said Luci is a \u201crunner\u201d if she gets out without a leash so she should always be on a leash when not in a secure fenced area.  (This is required for all of our adopted dogs, but is especially important with dogs who will not come when called.)\n\nLuci and Snickers are two easy going, well behaved girls who will make great companions for their new family.  They will be good girls while you are gone, they will be happy to see you when you are home, and they\u2019re content to entertain themselves (with naps) when you\u2019re busy. \n\nInterested in adding one of our adoptables to your family?

            "description": "***AVAILABLE FOR ADOPTION AT OUR FLORIDA LOCATION***\n\nCoco is a 1 year old female Terrier mix. She weighs approximately 30lbs, is house trained and Hw+.\n\nFrom her foster mom: Hello my name is Coco. I am a loving, playful, high energy pup, but can be very shy and submissive at first. My foster parents think some horrible humans were abusive to me in the past and I can get very scared thinking I will get yelled at. But I love to please! Once I warm up to you I will follow you everywhere and always want to play. I walk well on a leash and would love a home with another playful pup so we can wrestle and play all day long.\n\nCoco, like so many of our adults and mommas that come in, is heartworm positive. This is NOT contagious and is not a death sentence! We have started her on Heartgard which will keep new worms from growing and allow the ones already present to die off slowly. This is the safest way to do it in the group home setting. It is a very manageable treatment plan. Included in her adoption is a year supply of Heartgard.\n\nCoco is available in Bonifay, Florida through the rescue efforts of The Lucky Puppy Rescue. The minimum $250 adoption fee includes spay/neuter surgery, vaccinations, de-worm, flea prevention, heartworm prevention and martingale safety collar. Applications must be submitted through our website - theluckypuppy.org - thank you! You may copy and paste the following link to apply: http://www.theluckypuppy.org/adoption-application",

This handsome hunk-a guy is about 2 years old and weighs around 40 lbs though needs to fatten up a bit as life before the farm didn't always provide for regular meals. Donnal cannot wait to learn about the creature comforts of a home. He will surely sniff out every crumb on the floor and put the vacuum out of work, as he is hound loves to follow that nose. Walks would be a wonderful part of everyday with lots of nose work toonever know what he might find with that thing! Donnal does well with the other dogs and would easily fit into a home with canine friends. Happy go lucky and ready to sniff out fun, games and attention anywhere he goes, Donnal is ready to move and grove on home with you ASAP!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time.

My personality is as sweet as my face is, to the four and two footed kind. I'm a real cutie. Check out my coat, it's a beautiful cream color. I was found on the lam! I can't believe that my owner hasn't claimed me, dirty rat! So I'll be your girl, if you'll be my Doll!\nHere is what the staff has to say about me:\nShorty was a bad boy and was caught son the lam. Now he is doing some jail time. Poor guy. He came in with his buddy Jasmine. He is a sweet little guy that is only 11 pounds and around 5 years old. He is confident and outgoing. So come down to adopt this sweetie today!\nPlease call Faustina at 806-664-1615 since she can give you details about the dogs! If you call the Pampa Animal shelter please refer to the dogs by their number listed after the names. Thank you for you cooperation!",

We believe dad must have been a Shepherd mix too. \n\nTesla was a stray dog living in the woods under a collapsed house with her mom and a younger litter of half siblings. We were able to get the entire family to safety.\n\nTesla is a very sweet little girl, but is still afraid of humans. She will let you pet and hold her, but she will not willingly come to you for affection. When you do pet her, she will tuck her tail and lower her head as if she is afraid you will hurt her. She has the most soulful eyes, but they have zero spark to them. She is living life scared and unsure if she can trust. She has not shown aggression of any kind, she just trots away from you if she can. \n\nTesla would do great in a home with another dog, as she bonds quickly with them, and follows their lead. She needs the security of another dog showing her that life with your humans can be an amazing thing. \n\nThis wonderful little girl will melt your heart, and just needs a gentle hand and soft touch to help her become the confident little girl she was meant to be. If you have the loving home that Tesla is looking for please consider this wonderful little girl. You will not be disappointed and may just find the best friend you have ever had. \n\nTo adopt please email puppyrescue911@yahoo.com and ask for an adoption application. All information about the adoption process will be emailed to you along with the application. A vet reference check and home visit will also be done prior to adoption.\n\nAll Rescue Kids are fully vetted prior to adoption and includes:  spay or neuter, vaccinations to prevent kennel cough, distemper, parvo and leptospirosis, rabies vaccination for those older than 16 weeks, microchipped, and dewormed. They are also heartworm tested and treated if positive. Eyes, ears and teeth checked and any necessary medical work done.\n \nPupppy Rescue 911 takes in dogs with many different medical issues. We are committed to providing our rescue dogs with top of the line Veterinary care. Please make a donation to help with our medical expenses. We are a non profit rescue with 100% of donations going to the care of these animals.\n \nDonations can be made via Pay Pal to:\npuppyrescue911@yahoo.com\n \nOr directly towards our bill at:\nChester Animal Hospital\nc/o Puppy Rescue 911\n150 Taggart Lane\nChester IL. 62233-1001         \n \nAdoption fees vary depending on specifics of each dog.",

            "description": "Oooh la la.Lamar is in the house and he is a hoot and a half plus a bag of chips and a fizzy drink. This boy is all fun! Lamar is a lab mix who is a bit on the squatty side, which makes him that much cuter because who can resist a big dog body and personality on some shorter legs? We know we can't! Lamar is about a year or so old and has not had the best of days, showing some hair loss and little signs that he hasn't had the TLC he so deserves. No worries, all of that TLC started the day he joined the farm here at SG and he has been living large, making friends and doing him. Lamar is about 40 to 45 lbs now and is a chunk of dog though still lean and in need of filling out moreagain something he is already working at. He is a fun loving dude who loves to play, wrestle and go full speed whenever the opportunity arises. Lamar would fit easily into a home with a like energy dog and would seriously be up for most anything with you and whatever pack of friends you bring along. He could throw down for a game of football, chase a basketball or try his paw at tennis if the conditions were right, athletic as he is. As much as he goes hard when he plays, Lamar can settle into a crate like a good boy and naps just as hard. Lamar would like to be your love muffin in 2021 and promises to make everyday happier and a little more, heck a lot more, fun!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

She warmed up to her foster family with a younger child after a few days. She loves to play and snuggle with them on the couch. She would love a companion dog closer to her size to play and snuggle with. If you give her a chance she will snuggle her way into your heart!\n________________________ This puppy's adoption fee is $400. This does NOT include spay/neuter.\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application and a representative will get back to you shortly to answer any questions you may have.

Sit, down, stay, and go to kennel that is!\nI love to learn and am an eager student so I would just love it if you took me to some reward-based training classes. I am basically a big puppy and still have some puppy behaviors like being a touch mouthy that I need to work on so maybe no younger kiddos for me. I also am working on play boundaries with other dogs as I am very intense and this is not always accepted by other dogs. I am fostered with cats and have done well, but I do chase them and try to get them to play so a kitty friend would have to be very tolerant of my shenanigans. I am doing well with house training in my foster home. I have a great on and off switch, meaning I can play, play, play when you want and then settle for snuggles on the couch. I love my tummy rubbed and can't wait to find a family who will give me attention! I am still recovering from demodex mange (not contagious) and am getting all of my beautiful fur back; my adoption can be completed when the Doc says I am good to go!\n\nWe do not have a facility for you to visit.\n\nWE PROCESS APPLICANTS AND SET APPOINTMENTS BASED ON THE ORDER APPLICATIONS ARE RECEIVED\n\n, so while you are welcome to email\nccrcdogs@ccrcdogs.com\nwith specific questions, you will want to complete the\n\nONLINE APPLICATION\n\nASAP\n\n,\n\nwhich can be found at www.ccrcdogs.com,\n\nto secure your position in line for one of our dogs. You can also find\n\na description of our process on that same page. Puppies will not be available to be seen until their 10 day quarantine has passed. Our adoption fee is $200 for adults and $275 for puppies, which covers the cost of the spay/neuter, age appropriate shots and tests, medications to bring the dog to full health, and a free visit with one of our approved vets after adoption. The majority of dogs at CCRC are obtained from animal control centers, so there is often very little known about their history or even current habits. You can always expect to do some training, regardless of whether you adopt a dog or a puppy, including crate training, house training, and basic manners. CCRC provides a variety of materials and resources to assist you with this, as well as telephone support.",

Wylie is about 10 months old and weighs around 40 lbs now, but he is on the lean side and still has more growing to do as well. A Dobie mix, likely along with a hound of some kind, Wylie is an eye catcher for sure! This young man is still a bit shy and unsure of himself, no surprise as he is still a teen and working to figure everything out including things he has not yet had any experience with. Wylie would love a doggo friend to help show him the way and/or people who would enjoy training activities and doing lots of things with him to help him build confidence and learn about the wonderful world of suburbia. Wylie is young and playful and is totally in the market for active folks who enjoy walks and even hikes on a regular basis. He has learned tons already about crate training and waiting for meals and is just waiting to take his A student skills on home with you and settle right in. Wylie will be a-waiting!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

Brayden is a sweet, wiggly and waggly retriever mix who is about 2 years old and maybe 40 lbs full grown. He is a love bug for sure who is very people focused and loves to get as much attention, like STAT, as possible. Velcro dog in the making, Brayden loves time outside and will enjoy walks and socialization as much as time at home just doing whatever. He is a good boy in his crate, doesn't bark and waits patiently for his meals and time outside. With a medium energy level, Brayden is sure to fit easily into many types of homes. He gets along with other dogs but does not need them around to be happy. Now you, he definitely needs to be happy! Brayden will be waiting and holding onto his wiggle and wag until you arrive.hopefully that will be STAT as well!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

He\u2019ll never pass up the opportunity to jump in your lap for cuddles on the couch or go for a nice walk around the neighborhood. He loves making new canine friends, but he can be a little rough and rowdy so a Meet & Greet is required if you have a dog at home. Tofu loves to play fetch and tag with his friends and would love to have family to romp around the yard with. Tofu is good with dogs and older kids. He may already be potty trained as he is able to hold it until we let him out of his kennel in the mornings.\n\nWe're open Wednesday - Sunday 12 - 5 p.m but are doing meet & greets and adoptions by appointment only.  \n\nThe adoption fee is $90 which includes a free veterinary exam within 2 weeks of adoption at local participating vets, up to date vaccinations, heartworm test,  heartworm preventative, dewormer, flea preventative, microchip, & spay or neuter.\n\nIf you are interested in this pet, please fill out our ADOPTION APPLICATION at https://goo.gl/forms/9FdDBiPU5aa5ySTv1\n\nVisit our website at www.PetPlacementCenter.com",

            "description": "We are in love with Lana! This big lovable puppy (10 months) is so affectionate, happy, huggable, and no one can resist her. Lana was all by herself 22 hours a day outside in her former home and she is dreaming about a family who will bring her into their hearts and home, spend lots of time with her and make her a big part of their life. She wants to be loved and she will love you right back in the best possible way. Lana loves all people including polite kids, she thinks other dogs are great as long as they are gentle like her. She will need a no cat and no chicken home. Lana was alone so much for the first part of her life and she tried very hard to develop her fence climbing skills so she could get out and look for friends so she wouldn't be so lonely. Her new family would need to stay outside with her, keep her on leash, or make sure their fence was at least 6 ft. Lana does not wander off if you are with her, but she goal is to be with the people she loves. Her pictures don't really capture how beautiful she is!\n*If you are interested in adopting Lana please call the shelter (509 662-9577) to set up an appointment to meet her.",

He is gentle taking food and loves to give kisses, he is truly a sweet cuddle bug and companion. He enjoys chewing his toys, and is working on stairs, learning his name, and how to sit. \n\nTimon would be great with a family or person who wants to put in time to help him learn even more - he is eager to please and responsive to feedback - he will be a quick student! Timon has high energy so may not be the best fit with older dogs or cats as his pure love of life may overwhelm them. He keeps up with his 2-year-old foster brother! Timon is 5 and no longer a puppy but I don't think anyone told him because he still has that goofy puppy excitement, he loves to do spins when he sees other dogs and play pounces on new exciting toys. If you are looking for a ball of fun to cuddle with at the end of the day, Timon would make the best companion.\n\nIf you would like to find out more, please contact 206fosters@gmail.com.",

            "description": "Please fill out the application now if you are interested as we are still closed to the public and doing meet & greets and adoptions by appointment only.\n\nHank Aaron is a Hound mix boy that was born in November 2019 and weighs 62 pounds. \n\nHank is a special boy with a lot of love to give - happy, playful, and loveable. He had a rough start in his original home, but now we\u2019re doing eerything we can to find him a place to finally call his forever home. We are not sure exactly what happened in his previous life, but as a result, he is a little fearful of men when first meeting them. He\u2019s not aggressive, just shy. He prefers to sneak up behind you to sniff your ankles when you\u2019re not looking and slowly introduce himself, however, he loves the (human) ladies and gets so excited to make new female friends. Once he gets his initial sniff to verify you\u2019re a good person, he won\u2019t leave you alone.\n\nHank's favorite thing to do is lean and stick to you like velcro. He\u2019s very cuddly and just wants to be held and hugged. He is a little on the larger side and does have a lot to learn about being on a leash, but a well-sized harness and good strong leash will go a long way. He\u2019s always excited to go for a car ride and will even offer to drive if you don\u2019t want to. Hank loves to play with all sorts of toys or chew on a good antler or Benebone. He does love to make canine friends, but a Meet & Greet is required if you have a dog at home because he can be a little picky. Hank would do best in a home with a fenced-in backyard rather than an apartment and would do best with bigger kids/teenagers because he loves to give heavy hugs. \n\n \nWe're open Wednesday - Sunday 12 - 5 p.m but are doing meet & greets and adoptions by appointment only.  \n\nThe adoption fee is $90 which includes a free veterinary exam within 2 weeks of adoption at local participating vets, up to date vaccinations, heartworm test,  heartworm preventative, dewormer, flea preventative, microchip, & spay or neuter.\n\nIf you are interested in this pet, please fill out our ADOPTION APPLICATION at https://goo.gl/forms/9FdDBiPU5aa5ySTv1\n\nVisit our website at www.PetPlacementCenter.com",

When we picked him up, he was so skinny and had a lip injury we were very worried about initially. In 3 short weeks, this baby has already gained 9lbs and looks amazing. We learned from the vet that his lip injury was old, and had healed on its own. He was very lucky it didn\u2019t get infected as it healed, but now he has the cutest pout we have ever seen.\n\nDusty is around 9 years old, and is now up to 50lbs. His favorite activity is rocking in the recliner with his foster dad. His foster mom describes him as super sweet, calm, and gentle. He gets along well with their their other dogs, as well as their children (9 and 4). He really loves affection, likes his kennel, and even walks well on a leash (no cats please). Overall, this sweet boy is pretty perfect. He does still need to complete his heart worm treatment, but that cost will be covered by our generous donors. Our goal is to find this sweetheart a family who will recognize the amazing boy he is, and allow him to be your best friend\n\nThanks for considering a Cane Rosso Rescue dog! \nWe place dogs mostly in Texas but have adopted out a few out-of-state as well.\n \nIf you are interested in one of our dogs, please first complete our adoption application.\nYou can find it at https://www.canerossorescue.org/adoption-application . His adoption fee is $150 plus tax. Our dogs are spayed or neutered, microchipped, vaccinated and heartworm tested and treated (if tested positive) before going to a new home. For more information, visit our website www.canerossorescue.org\nor email us at rescue@canerosso.com.",

Your experience may differ.\n\nADOPTION FEE INCLUDES:\n\nWellness check\n\nSpay/neuter (puppies adopted with required spay/neuter certificate)\n\nAge appropriate vaccines - rabies as required by law and distemper combo or proof of positive titer test\n\nHeartworm test if over 7 months of age\n\nFecal test and/or deworming for parasites\n\nMicrochip\n\n\n\n~ Healing Hearts rescue will also provide dental procedures, bloodwork, surgeries, and/or any other additional vet work as needed while dogs are in our care.\n\n~ Adoption fees are non-negotiable and fees are listed on the dog's profile\n\n~ Adoption fees can be paid the following ways with the required sales tax (7.525%) added:\n\nPayPal\n\nCredit Card\n\nCash\n\nWANT TO HELP SAVE MORE DOGS?\n\nHealing Hearts Rescue is a nonprofit, foster-based rescue\n\nlocated in the Twin Cities area of Minnesota\n\nthat is 100% funded through adoption fees and donations\n\n.

Most of our adoptable dogs were previously stray dogs with little history, we can't be 100% sure of a dog's breed mix, and unless there is a specific date of birth listed, we can't be 100% sure of a dog's age. Additionally, our assessments of a dog's interactions with other dogs, cats, or children are based on OUR experiences. Your experience may differ.\n\nADOPTION FEE INCLUDES:\n\nWellness check\n\nSpay/neuter (puppies adopted with required spay/neuter certificate)\n\nAge appropriate vaccines - rabies as required by law and distemper combo or proof of positive titer test\n\nHeartworm test if over 7 months of age\n\nFecal test and/or deworming for parasites\n\nMicrochip\n\n\n\n~ Healing Hearts rescue will also provide dental procedures, bloodwork, surgeries, and/or any other additional vet work as needed while dogs are in our care.\n\n~ Adoption fees are non-negotiable and fees are listed on the dog's profile\n\n~ Adoption fees can be paid the following ways with the required sales tax (7.525%) added:\n\nPayPal\n\nCredit Card\n\nCash\n\nWANT TO HELP SAVE MORE DOGS?\n\nHealing Hearts Rescue is a nonprofit, foster-based rescue\n\nlocated in the Twin Cities area of Minnesota\n\nthat is 100% funded through adoption fees and donations\n\n.

Could also be trained to go hunting or help out on a farm as he's very smart!\nHooch likes to play with other dogs but is very high energy. He may be too much for an older dog or a less playful submissive dog.\nPlease consider making this handsome boy a member of your family. As we are a foster based rescue, we do require a completed application to be submitted before we arrange a meet. This can be found on our website at : https://almosthomepetrescue.org/apply-now-1\n\n$150 adoption fee includes core vaccinations, rabies vaccination, heart worm test (in dogs over 6 months of age), microchip and registration, spay/neuter, wormer and flea and heart worm prevention while the dog is in our care.

            "description": "Meet Julie!\n\nIf you enjoy a companion who just wants to snuggle with you on the sofa, head in your lap watching TV, Julie is your girl. Julie is 8 years old and she weighs about 58 pounds. She is the sweetest, most loving dog a person could have. She will follow you into every room, lie down and wait for you to finish your chores. She will come and sit in front of you at attention and softly groan to let you know she wants food or a walk. So adorable! While she is a calm, coach potato inside, she is an enthusiastic walker outside, though she could use a bit more training on the leash. She loves her two walks a day, one after breakfast and one after diner. Although Julie is a quiet dog, she is a good watch dog. She will bark when someone comes to the door or in the yard. She will also alert you when she hears some noise in the house. In terms of environment, Julie will do better in a quiet house with calm teenagers and/or adults. She is truly a companion dog and won't be as happy if left alone all day as if someone were home with her. She does not like to be left alone in the yard either. Now, maybe if she had a companion dog, that might be different. In terms of a companion, Julie would do better with medium to large dogs although she may want most of the attention. She had two companion dogs when she was with her previous owner, one was male and the other female. So, if you are looking for a true companion who just wants to be with you, this loving, affectionate girl is waiting for you.\n\nAlbert's Dog Lounge is a transporting dog rescue, meaning that we rescue many of our dogs from high kill shelters in areas of dog overpopulation. We are a specialty rescue focusing primarily on senior and special needs dogs.  The vast majority of our dogs come from the Houston, TX area where we have an entire team of volunteers, coordinators, and fosters. We do also work with local shelters, rescues, and owners.  If you apply for a dog that is currently in our local Houston program, we will work to get your dog transported to WI as quickly as possible. We ask that you have patience during this time of uncertainty and unprecedented dog adoptions nationwide. \n\nLearn more about Albert's Dog Lounge, our mission, and adoption policies by visiting Albertsdoglounge.org. \n\nOur process includes an approved application, reference checks, a homevisit, and then a meet and greet with the dog. Adoption fee is $275.\n\nBegin your application process by copying this link into your web browser: https://www.albertsdoglounge.org/apply\n\nWI Dept. Of Agriculture License Number: 474085-DS",

If you are looking for a bite-sized bestie for your home, please complete the adoption application on hsnb.org/adoptions. My adoption fee is $350. Thank you kindly!

She aims to please and would do well with a quiet family. She's a 2 year old shepherd mix and around 31 pounds. She gets along with her buds on the farm but is perfectly happy on her own. A fam with another like-minded pup would be a fun companion for her to help her build her confidence. One look into those gorgeous eyes of hers and you'll be smitten, and those ears, tho! She's really the total package of cute, fun and snuggles. With some reassurance from her loving, new family, Noel will blossom into the forever companion you've been waiting for.\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/.

Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only.

I know I'm not a puppy but I can do anything a puppy can do but even better. I'm housetrained. I know how to cuddle and give lots of love and kisses. I know that I should be good and I do that pretty well. I get along with other dogs, and even kids! I love blankets and sleeping. Who doesn't like a good nap?\n\nMy muzzle has turned a little gray but I think I look beautiful and distinguished. I have beautiful short brindle fur. So how did I end up in up in foster care you ask?? Well, my previous parents took my brother and I to our veterinarian clinic for boarding back in November 2020 and never came back for us. My brother left back in December to go to a German Shepard rescue and I bet he found a new home already. I don't know why our parents gave us up. We were good dogs. I guess they didn't love us as much as we loved them. So if anyone wants a loving lady, I'm your girl. I'm ready to be all yours! \n\nAlbert's Dog Lounge is a transporting dog rescue, meaning that we rescue many of our dogs from high kill shelters in areas of dog overpopulation. We are a specialty rescue focusing primarily on senior and special needs dogs.  The vast majority of our dogs come from the Houston, TX area where we have an entire team of volunteers, coordinators, and fosters. We do also work with local shelters, rescues, and owners.  If you apply for a dog that is currently in our local Houston program, we will work to get your dog transported to WI as quickly as possible. We ask that you have patience during this time of uncertainty and unprecedented dog adoptions nationwide. \n\nLearn more about Albert's Dog Lounge, our mission, and adoption policies by visiting Albertsdoglounge.org. \n\nOur process includes an approved application, reference checks, a homevisit, and then a meet and greet with the dog. Adoption fee is $275.\n\nBegin your application process by copying this link into your web browser: https://www.albertsdoglounge.org/apply\n\nWI Dept. Of Agriculture License Number: 474085-DS",

            "description": "This curly boy is Dudley, he was found as a stray running in and out of traffic on a freeway ramp in Indy. Dudley has been in his foster home for a bit now getting vetted and learning some manners while we learned about him\n\nHere is Dudley's foster's input:\n\n Will need a home with other dogs. He has a very high \"play\" drive. He has done well with the other two dogs in his foster home (plays for hours).\n\n Okay with cats. He has been around the fosters cat with interest but without issue.\n\n Food motivated/not food aggressive.\n\n High energy. Fenced yard required. Does frequent \"zoomies\" in the house.\n\n Busy. He checks everything out with his nose. Has a fetish for fabrics. Loves to steal/play with gloves, socks, small rags, etc.\n\n Crate trained. Sleeps well in crate at night.\n\n Tolerates time at home alone. Did well confined to the kitchen when the foster was gone for large periods of the day over 2 weeks with no accidents or damage.\n\n Trainable. Demonstrated greatly improved walking on leash with introduction of 3 in 1 harness. Responds to \"sit\" and \"off\" working on \"down.\"\n\n Loves to be near his people. Follows people around (closely) and wants to be in the same room with them.\n\n Would need a home with no/older children. He grabs sleeves or the back of pant legs to get human attention and will need further training to stop this.\n\n Is \"somewhat\" housebroken. Still learning and has an accident here and there.\n\n Neutered, has shots, negative for heart worm. He has had Rabies, DAPP, Bordetella and he tested negative on 4DX Snap Test\n\n Weight: 27 lbs (approximately)\n\n Age: 1 year (based on several estimates) - very, very much still a puppy\n\n Escapes: Dudley is a \"runner\" and regularly checks the gate at the fosters house to see if he can head out for some freedom in the neighborhood.\n\n Car rides: tolerates well\n\n Must be experienced with very active dogs - absolutely not a first time dog owner\n\n Training - must be very capable of training/willing to take to training class and consistently reinforce (otherwise \"Dudley will train you)\n\nWe require that you have a fenced in yard, not a \"kennel\" in the yard AND we do not approve underground fencing. Depending upon the dog some exceptions are made for those who live in apartments. We also require that the adoptee will be a part of the family \"living\" within the home. Our adoption process may be found on our website at www.bitofheaven.org\n\nVisits are scheduled by appointment only via emailing request to ownedbycaninesandlovit@yahoo.com",

            "description": "Meet sweet mama Darla! She is around 2 years old and is likely a mix of many breeds, but may have Pit Bull Terrier and Whippet in her. She is petite at only about 30 lbs. Darla came to Labs and More with her 9 puppies who are now around 2 months old. Darla is ready to put parenthood behind her and get the TLC she needs. Darla is a shy girl who seems to warm up to women faster than men. She is looking for a kind and patient family that will help her work on her confidence and come out of her shell. For that reason, she would do best in a quieter home at this time. Once she trusts you, she is a sweetheart who enjoys receiving attention. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting Darla, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs. Thank you for rescuing.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue.

Get ready for cuteness overload with these cuddly Terrier and maybe Shepherd mixes! They are around 2 months old and are super excited to find forever families to call their own. Their beautiful mom, Darla weighs about 30 lbs, and looks to be a true Heinz-57. We don't know who fathered these happy little love bugs, or what all they are mixed with, but we are guessing they will be medium in size when full grown. Jane is looking for a family that understands the time, patience, and energy needed to raise a young pup. We require all puppy adopters to provide training that includes: house training, basic training, leash training, and socialization. Additionally, this cutie is going to need proper exercise, mental stimulation, and your attention and love to grow up to be the best companion. We do not allow our dogs or puppies to sleep or live outside; they must be incorporated into your family and be made a priority in your life. In return, you will have the most loving and loyal family member you could ask for. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting a puppy, then fill out an adoption application on our website today!

            "description": "True to their names, Darla's Little Rascals are adventurous, playful and just a touch mischievous! Get ready for cuteness overload with these cuddly Terrier and possibly Shepherd mixes! They are around 2 months old and are super excited to find forever families to call their own. Their beautiful mom, Darla weighs about 30 lbs, and looks to be a true Heinz-57. We don't know who fathered these happy little love bugs, or what all they are mixed with, but we are guessing they will be medium in size when full grown. Spanky is looking for a family that understands the time, patience, and energy needed to raise a young pup. We require all puppy adopters to provide training that includes: house training, basic training, leash training, and socialization. Additionally, this cutie is going to need proper exercise, mental stimulation, and your attention and love to grow up to be the best companion. We do not allow our dogs or puppies to sleep or live outside; they must be incorporated into your family and be made a priority in your life. In return, you will have the most loving and loyal family member you could ask for. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting a puppy, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs.

            "description": "True to their names, Darla's Little Rascals are adventurous, playful and just a touch mischievous! Get ready for cuteness overload with these cuddly Terrier and maybe Shepherd mixes! They are around 2 months old and are super excited to find forever families to call their own. Their beautiful mom, Darla weighs about 30 lbs, and looks to be a true Heinz-57. We don't know who fathered these happy little love bugs, or what all they are mixed with, but we are guessing they will be medium in size when full grown. Alfalfa is looking for a family that understands the time, patience, and energy needed to raise a young pup. We require all puppy adopters to provide training that includes: house training, basic training, leash training, and socialization. Additionally, this cutie is going to need proper exercise, mental stimulation, and your attention and love to grow up to be the best companion. We do not allow our dogs or puppies to sleep or live outside; they must be incorporated into your family and be made a priority in your life. In return, you will have the most loving and loyal family member you could ask for. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting a puppy, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs.

            "description": "True to their names, Darla's Little Rascals are adventurous, playful and just a touch mischievous! Get ready for cuteness overload with these cuddly Terrier and possibly Shepherd mixes! They are around 2 months old and are super excited to find forever families to call their own. Their beautiful mom, Darla weighs about 30 lbs, and looks to be a true Heinz-57. We don't know who fathered these happy little love bugs, or what all they are mixed with, but we are guessing they will be medium in size when full grown. Buckwheat is looking for a family that understands the time, patience, and energy needed to raise a young pup. We require all puppy adopters to provide training that includes: house training, basic training, leash training, and socialization. Additionally, this cutie is going to need proper exercise, mental stimulation, and your attention and love to grow up to be the best companion. We do not allow our dogs or puppies to sleep or live outside; they must be incorporated into your family and be made a priority in your life. In return, you will have the most loving and loyal family member you could ask for. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting a puppy, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs.

            "description": "True to their names, Darla's Little Rascals are adventurous, playful and just a touch mischievous! Get ready for cuteness overload with these cuddly Terrier and maybe Shepherd mixes! They are around 2 months old and are super excited to find forever families to call their own. Their beautiful mom, Darla weighs about 30 lbs, and looks to be a true Heinz-57. We don't know who fathered these happy little love bugs, or what all they are mixed with, but we are guessing they will be medium in size when full grown. Porky is looking for a family that understands the time, patience, and energy needed to raise a young pup. We require all puppy adopters to provide training that includes: house training, basic training, leash training, and socialization. Additionally, this cutie is going to need proper exercise, mental stimulation, and your attention and love to grow up to be the best companion. We do not allow our dogs or puppies to sleep or live outside; they must be incorporated into your family and be made a priority in your life. In return, you will have the most loving and loyal family member you could ask for. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting a puppy, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs. Thank you for rescuing.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue.

Cheech has lived with kids of all ages and loved to have someone to protect - he can be excitable and will knock over young kids on accident. He got along well with the other dogs in the home. He does well on car rides and enjoys them once he realizes what is going on. He loves to play tug-of-war and his favorite toys are the ropes. \nCheech has successfully gotten over a regular 4ft chainlink fence, and will require something more secure to keep him safe! He is house-trained and will go to the door to let you know if he has to potty! \nCheech is neutered, microchipped, and up to date on all shots. He is a very large boy weighing in at approximately 80 pounds. His estimated date of birth is 4/15/19....All pets have lifetime sanctuary at Haven of the Ozarks. If they cannot remain with their adopter, they must be returned to the Haven.\n\nAdoption fees are as follows: \nPuppies under the age of 6 months - $125\nDogs weighing 30 pounds and less - $125 \nDogs ages 6 months to 5 yrs old - $90\nDogs over the age of 5 yrs old - $75.\nCats under the age of 6 months old - $75\nCats over the age of 6 months old - $65",

I'm small, friendly, and my coat is super duper soft! I just arrived from a shelter in North Carolina, so the caretakers here are still getting to know me. They know that I'm super nice and am sure to be a snuggle bug once I'm in a home with a soft couch. Doesn't that sounds nice?! I loooove running around the yard. When I get the zoomies, my floppy ears fly back and my big cheeks bounce up and down while I run! They also learned that I could use a little practice with some basic manners. When I'm excited I can't help but jump! It's cute, but a bit inappropriate. But I'm so young, I'm sure I can catch on to any training you want with a few good practices! I'm not sure how I would deal with another dog in my face just yet, but I do OK in the kennels with dogs being moved in front of me. I'm also not too sure about cats or kids yet. Have a conversation with the staff to learn more. If I seem like a good fit for you, stop into Stray Haven and we can hang out for a bit!

            "description": "Hello! Halo here, a 1-and-a-half-year-old Catahoula Leopard Dog/Boxer mix! I'm quite the looker with 1 blue eye! I have the biggest bat-like ears and the personality to match! I'm a playful little girl who just got sent up here from a shelter in North Carolina. I'm looking for a home that can tire me out, because I have some energy! Most of that energy is put toward getting attention from the people I like. I loooove getting petted! I could stand to learn some manners though when it comes to personal space. I tend to jump when I get excited. The staff here are working on it with me, but WOW I'm so happy to see them I can't help but jump! I'm not too sure how I feel about dogs, cats or kids just yet. In my previous home, I got pregnant young because they were irresponsible with me and didn't have my spayed. When my puppies were born, I was protective (of all 9!) and my human mom didn't like that. She ended up giving all my puppies away at 3 weeks of age (which was far too young) and took me to the shelter saying I was aggressive. Luckily the staff knew better and said I was a great girl, just needed some structure and some basic manners and my protective nature was simply due to my hormones. I'll be spayed before I got to my new home so there's no worry about that again! I am confident and very active so make sure you're ready for a gal like me. But I'm adorable and smaller in size and my personality is pretty endearing that I know someone will choose me and we will have a fun and great life together!\nStray Haven Humane Society & SPCA\n194 Shepard Rd., Waverly, NY 14892\n(607) 565-2859, www.strayhavenspca.org \nOpen hours (winter): Tues, Wed & Thurs Noon - 6pm; Sat 10am-4pm",

This heavenly Princess is going to steal your heart! She's an energetic happy puppy that's going to be a great addition to any home. Kalani would love a home with fenced yard to safely run and play in with another dog or children. Like all puppies Kalani would benefit from obedience training plus training is a great way to bond with your new dog. If you would like to meet Kalani, please fill out an adoption application and plan to fall in love!!!Please read the animal bios completely before requesting additional information as we do our best to answer the most frequently ask questions in these bios. \n\nIn order to adopt one of our animals an application must be submitted and approved. You can find these applications by going to http://humanemorgan.org/index.php?page=adoption \n\nABOUT ADOPTING FROM THE HSMC: \nThe shelter address is 1170 Fairground Rd. Madison, GA 30650. For more information on any of our pets, please feel free to email us at INFO@HUMANEMORGAN.ORG give us a call at 706-343-9977. \nAll dogs are heartworm negative, current on vaccines/dewormings, and microchipped. \nAll cats are FeLv/FIV negative, current on vaccines/dewormings, and microchipped. \nWe are open 10am-5pm Monday-Saturday, we schedule our last adoption at 4pm everyday to allow our staff enough time to feed and walk dogs. \nWe are an animal shelter and therefore are not able to individually potty train our residents. Many adult dogs do arrive \"\"house broken\"\" however due to animal behavior any change in environment will make an emotional impact on the animals and therefore initiate unwanted behaviors during the acclamation period. Please keep this in mind. Puppies do not have the biological maturity to maintain absolute bladder or bowel control and will require a certain degree of potty training and house breaking. Please consider the time and commitment it takes to provide the necessary building blocks for these special babies, prior to submitting your application. \nIf you have any questions please email us at info@humanemorgan.org and provide name of the animal you are interested in, in the subject line. \nThank you, HSMC Staff \n\nADOPTION FEES Adoption Fees may change without notice. Always verify the fee when finalizing the adoption. \n~ Cats and Kittens ~ \n* Under 1 Year = $100 \n* 1-5 Years = $75 \n* Over 5 Years = $50 \n** Purebred cats and kittens may be subject to special pricing \n\n~ Mix Breed Dogs ~ \n* Under 1 Year = $200 \n* 1 -3 Years = $175 \n* 4-8 Years = $150 \n* Over 8 Years = $100\n\n~ Purebred and Designer Breed Dogs ~ \n* Under 1 Year = $375 \n* 1-3 Years = $350 \n* 4-8 Years = $275 \n* Over 8 Years = $150 \n\n~ Medical and Special Needs ~ \nWe have rescued dogs and cats which require additional medical care or that have special needs which are not life threatening. In these cases we may require a higher fee to help recoup the costs of their care while at our rescue.",

            "description": "Hi! I'm Boy George - a lovable and cuddly 9-month-old pup who is ready to take on the world with my future person/people. I know you'll love my long legs, little brown \"\"eyebrows\"\", and friendly personality. My foster pawrents have lots of good things to say about me - they said I am a delight and the sweetest dog! I'm housetrained and walk well on a leash. Because of COVID, I have not had the chance to meet too many other dogs, but I'm good with calmer and quieter dogs. I have a nice energy level too - I get bursts of playfulness where I like to run around the living room or play fetch but equally enjoy lounging on the couch/bed and snuggling. I will bring you a toy when I want to play which I think is pretty cute! I also have a favorite teddy bear and rope toy, both of which I like to carry around with me \n\nI picked up on crate-training pretty easily - I really like it when I get treats or toys to keep my mind occupied while I'm in there, like yummy stuffed Kongs. When my foster mom comes home, I will be sleeping in my crate like the good boy that I am. I love all people! I want to be friends with everyone (stranger is not a word in my vocabulary), and I also really love spending time with my own people too; my foster pawrents love how loyal I am. I'm always happy to see you when you come home (even if you have just been gone for a few minutes) and am happy to hang out with you, even if that means just spending time together cuddling on the couch. As you can see, I'm a sweet, curious, and friendly pup who is ready to bring lots of fun and love to my fur-ever home. I cannot wait to meet you!\n\n\nMy adoption fee is $200. This includes a spay/neuter, up-to-date vaccines, deworming, a microchip, a heartworm test, and, if needed, heartworm treatment.\n\n________________________________________________\n\nFor all animals that have not been spayed or neutered a $100 deposit will be required in addition to the adoption fee. The deposit is refundable upon completion of the spay / neuter surgery.\n\nFor more information email: adopt@animalrescueneworleans.org.\n\nTo complete an application, please visit: https://animalrescueneworleans.org/adoptfoster/.\n\nPlease visit our facebook for more information about adoption specials, and adoption events. Events are a great way to meet multiple animals at a time!",

            "description": "Sky is a sweet girl who loves attention. She will seek out belly rubs every chance she gets. She also loves being outside and is eager to make friends with people or animals walking by. She hasn't displayed any aggressiveness with us and will chose to be in a room where the people are located. She is very motivated with food and treats. She does a good job in her crate but definitely appreciates being able to stretch out. \n\nJust a reminder, my house is a family of 4. My daughter is 13, my son almost 9. She mostly follows my husband around, when she has options. She has only peed in the house one time, otherwise she has been going to the door or even barked when she had to go out. She hasn't barked much. Her most immediately thing to train would be a solid OFF command. She does jump up on her hind legs a lot. She will try to get things off of the counters, tables, etc as soon as she can, especially if it is food related. She also doesn't care what or whom she steps on.\n\nOtherwise, my biggest concern for her is her hip. There are many times when she will not put any weight on that leg. Physically, one can feel a difference in her hips if you just run your hands down her sides to her hind parts. Should be interesting to see what the vet has to say. \n\nIn terms of the Foster Parent Observation Form, here's the information- \n\nFeeding schedule - We have been feeding her twice a day. 8 am and between 5 and 6 pm. We are giving her a half and half mixture of Earthborn Venture Alaska Polluck and Pumpkin and Earthborn Venture Smoked Turkey and Butternut Squash. Total dog food equals about 1.5 to 1.75 cups at each meal. \n\nPotty schedule - She seems to only be pooping once a day. Otherwise, we let her out first thing in the morning. We let her out several times during the day. We also let her out before we go to bed each night. She has only gotten us up once by barking to let her out during the night. I believe she could hold it longer during the day but here, she doesn't have to do so.\n\nSleep schedule - She takes several naps throughout the day. As long as she is in the room with people, she is fairly content. I believe her hip mobility severely impacts her activity levels. She is definitely more docile. We have been crating her to sleep at night. \n\nLikes - She hasn't taken to many toys. She loves treats and food. She will jump up and do anything to get to food and the person who has the food or treat. We don't have any other pets but she is always eager to be friends with pets who are walking by our house. We haven't socialized her with any though. So far her favorite treat is the Wellness soft well bites in the beef and turkey flavor.\n\nDislikes - So far she hasn't reacted to anything poorly. \n\nOther pertinent info - We have found it necessary for her to be in her crate for us to eat. Again, she goes into her crate easily. I usually toss a treat into her crate. Then give her another one once we have the crate securely closed. She stays there without a fuss until we are done eating and cleaning up. Then we let her back out. \n\nShe craves attention. She is letting us do more things now that she has built up a greater level of trust, but she still craves attention. \n\nShe also tends to fall off our ottoman (or ottoman is huge - 3 feet square) She leans or rolls and just tumbles off. We try to catch her but she is big and sometimes we aren't close enough. I am not sure if her hip can't support her or if she is just simply unaware of what she is doing. She also has a harder time going down our stairs. Again - I am sure the hip has everything to do with that. We try to keep her from going upstairs too much just because we don't want her to have issues coming down.\n\nAll in all, she is a good, sweet dog who loves to cuddle.To complete an adoption application, go to: http://almosthomeanimals.org/applications/adoption/",

I think he would love a buddy, but doesn't need one \n\nCat Friendly? Yes. Lived with 3 cats\n\nKid Friendly: \nNot yet tested by me but did live in a home with a 4 year old \nIf yes, what's the youngest child you'd recommend they be placed with? 4 years old\n\nSpecial traits that make your foster special or that we need to know about them? \nMidnight was surrendered this week. He does not have vision in his left eye due to an injury from a cat. He has adapted quite well. He is very well behaved and has many good habits already in place. Chasing a ball is his fav activity. \nHe has a slight personal space issue which can be endearing but not always- he thinks hes a lap dog and dives right onto your lap or chair so were working on boundaries.\nHe is a joy to foster and a happy boy.",

            "description": "Dena\nFemale\nAge: 7 years old\nWeight: 55lbs\nBreed: Pitbull mix\n\nHey there, Im Dena! I am the happiest most excited girl when I get to see my human; I just wiggle all over! Speaking of getting excited, I must admit I love humans so much! In fact, I even get excited when new friends come over to meet me! I would do best in a home with older children because I can get overly excited and sometimes try to jump for kisses and would hate to hurt a smaller human!\nI enjoy going on walks and think I do a great job walking on a leash. After my walks, I curl up for a good nap. I am a pretty chill girl who would love someone who is up for a good snuggle in the evenings while we watch some Netflix; peanut butter filled Kongs and tummy rubs are encouraged! I know the command, sit and am working on learning more commands! I am house trained and crate trained; I will go right into my crate and sometimes will relax there for fun! I get a little nervous when my people leave and will whine for a bit. My foster family is helping me learn that they will return soon, but for his reason, I would do best in a house as opposed to an apartment setting. Speaking of my perfect home, I would love to be an only dog. That way I would not need to share any of the amazing attention I would receive! I mean, I would not mind sharing a home with another chill fur brother, but no other ladies for me. I would certainly need to meet my potential fur sibling before finding my forever home to ensure we would be best buds for life! I really enjoy walking around my fenced in yard, but if you play with me enough, I do not think I would need a fence in my forever home.\n\nI think my perfect family is out there for me, I just know it!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting the wiggly, Dena, apply to adopt at www.causeforcanines.org Adoption fee is $250\nChildren must be 11 years old or older\nMust be an Ohio resident 25 years old or older\nNo cats or small dogs",

Jenna is a curious pup that loves to explore the world around her and she loves to give kisses. She also enjoys peanut butter and frozen peas and carrots. While Jenna has that playful puppy energy, she can also be found with her sister Gina just sitting, watching, and learning about what's going on around them. Jenna is getting used to wearing a collar and learning what a leash is and is currently working on crate and potty training. Jenna is spayed, up to date on vaccines, and microchipped.

Gina will occasionally start to play with her foster-brother but she is hesitant around him and eventually does get overwhelmed and shrinks away. Besides naps, toys, and treats of peanut butter and frozen peas and carrots, Gina also likes meal time. Gina is currently getting used to wearing a collar and learning what a leash is and has just started crate and potty training. \nGina is spayed, current on vaccines, and microchipped.

She is going to be a wonderful pet for a single, active person or a family with older children. Gemma would be great in an apartment or equally in a home with a fenced yard. This girl is so loving but she does not care for other dogs. She is med energy and does great on a leash. We will be uploading video asap. Estimated DOB: 01/13/2019. Current weight: 51lbs. Heartworm negative. \n\nBlackdog Club is a facility-based rescue. We are open to the public Wednesday-Sunday between 10-6. An appointment is not required. \n\nIf an adopter wishes to bring a current pet for a meet/greet, please send vet records showing the pet is UTD on all vaccines prior to your visit to blackdogclub@outlook.com\n\nThe adoption fee includes spay or neuter, microchip, age-appropriate vaccines, rabies vaccine, fecal test, deworming, and heartworm test. Dogs are treated if heartworm positive. All dogs are UTD on heartworm/flea/tick prevention. All dogs are health screened and vaccinated by our vet, Family Pet Animal Hospital or Quality Care Animal Hospital.\n\nWe do not know if our dogs are house trained. They are crated overnight.",

It was decided that he needed a loving family and the community convinced the owner to surrender. Copper was taught by the community to not chase chickens. We cat tested him yesterday and he showed no interest at all. Copper is a big lover of all humans. He is low/med energy and would make a great pet for most any family. While I'm sure he'd love a good walk/hike, I know he would be happy curled up on a bed. He is quiet...we've not heard him bray at all. Estimated DOB: 07/29/2019. Current weight: 67lbs. Heartworm test pending. \n\nBlackdog Club is a facility-based rescue. We are open to the public Wednesday-Sunday between 10-6. An appointment is not required. \n\nIf an adopter wishes to bring a current pet for a meet/greet, please send vet records showing the pet is UTD on all vaccines prior to your visit to blackdogclub@outlook.com\n\nThe adoption fee includes spay or neuter, microchip, age-appropriate vaccines, rabies vaccine, fecal test, deworming, and heartworm test. Dogs are treated if heartworm positive. All dogs are UTD on heartworm/flea/tick prevention. All dogs are health screened and vaccinated by our vet, Family Pet Animal Hospital or Quality Care Animal Hospital.\n\nWe do not know if our dogs are house trained. They are crated overnight.",

Everyone can love me! I'm a silly girl and I have energy...But I'd also love to cuddle if you're a couch potato. If you're interested in me, please fill out an application at CHAadopt.org!

The shelter people let us cuddle sometime)All cats and dogs adopted from the Chequamegon Humane Association are spayed or neutered, up-to-date on age appropriate vaccinations, dewormed, and microchipped.

Her momma is about 35 lbs so if we had to guess, we'd say she'll end up around a medium size pup when full grown. Flower is a petite girl and is always exploring. She's so curious of everything around her - it's fun to watch experience all the new things. She's happy go lucky and when you call her name, she doesn't just run to you, she does a little prance/hop and it's got to be one of the cutest things ever!\n\nFlower will be tentatively available for adoption on Wednesday, 1/27, on our website under Adoptions Uncrated at 7pm.",

Apartments not recommended.\nFence Requirements: Preferred.\nSpecial Info: Shera likes to jump up and give hugs!\n\nThe information we are providing for this animal was developed based on observations and assessments in a shelter or foster environment. We do our best to provide information that will help determine if the dog might be a good fit for you. Please note that behaviors may change in a home environment. We also ask our applicants to assume that any animal they adopt from us will need to be potty trained and learn house manners, although this is not always the case. Our online animal bios are designed to provide as much information as possible and answer some anticipated questions. We do not have the resources to respond to emails with more specific questions.\n\nWe are receiving an unusually high number of applications per pet at this time! Please follow the rules below to ensure your application is reviewed; pay attention closely to these instructions because applications will NOT be processed if they are not followed. Please keep in mind that dog/cat availability is currently changing by the hour; you will receive an email if the animal you are interested in is no longer available. New dogs become available almost every day, so feel free to let us know if someone else interests you if your initial choice is already adopted! \n\nFill out the application (DOG: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IHD-DOG-Application-9-10-18.pdf, CAT: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IHD-CAT-Application.pdf) completely. Every question must be answered, and it must be signed. If you are going to type your responses, open the application, save it, type your answers, and save it again. \n\n-Applicants must be 21+ years old and live within a 50-mile radius of our shelter at 22415 Groesbeck Hwy, Warren 48089.\n\n-You must identify at least 1 dog/cat that you are interested in. If there are multiple dogs/cats, number them in order of priority. \n\n-Scan a copy of proof of home ownership (i.e. tax bill, deed, or mortgage payment - you can black out the account #, etc.) or animal clause/agreement of your rental agreement.\n\n-Attach the application and home ownership proof/rental agreement animal clause to a new email and send it to bark@iheartdogs.org. The subject line must be formatted to read \"\"#1 choice of dog/cat, Your First and Last Name\"\". Example: Subject: Fido, Jane Doe\nOnce your application is received, it will be assigned to an Adoption Counselor who will follow-up with the applicant who is the best fit within a few days, or to discuss other dogs/cats. It could take up to a couple of weeks for you to receive a final disposition on your application so there is no need to check on the status.\n\n-Introductions will be scheduled by appointment only, 45 minutes per appointment. The entire household, including current dogs, must be present for the appointment. The introductions will take place outside in our parking lot.\n\n-We will continue to perform vet checks for current and prior pets in the household.\n\n-Home visits will be in person for the yard and virtual for inside the home.\n\n-Finalizing the adoption will also be scheduled by appointment.\n\nWhile this process may seem cumbersome, it is interim during COVID-19, and it is designed to help us respond to the volume of emails we receive every day. Since we are receiving a high volume of applications, please be patient if a dog/cat is no longer available. \n\nThank you for your understanding.",

His family had a new baby and they feel that they are now unable to give Benny the love and attention that he deserves. He has been trained by Smart Dog School and is a graduate. Hes crate trained and potty trained. We think he would be best in a house with an active mom/dad. Or a house with other active dogs that he can run and play with. He loves being outside and playing. He is crate trained and used to sleeping in his crate at night. He is energetic and active and good with kids, cats and dogs.\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting this baby, please fill out an application. They currently are fixed, up to date on shots, wormings, preventatives and are microchipped. Adoption fee is $188 ($175 Adoption Fee + $13 Lifetime Registration Fee for Microchip), applications can be filled out at this link. https://www.petstablished.com/adoption_form/10167/generic .We cannot guarantee breed or size when full grown.\n\nDue to our current situation, with more great applicants than we have available puppies and young adults, we are no longer accepting applications from people that are over 150 miles away. Exceptions will be made on dogs over the age of 3, special needs dogs and direct referrals from our volunteers.",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Bailey. I am a super sweet, loving, smart and extremely playful 9 month old Australian Shepherd/Border Collie mix with the energy of a true Border Collie. I am looking for a forever home with a human who is as active as me and has Border Collie/Australian Shepherd experience as well as a comfortable bed that I can sleep on at night. I am potty trained and know how to sit and wait for my dinner. I also do well in my crate. I would love to go running with my forever family or even complete in agility. Some of my favorite activities include hiking, playing with stuffed animals and playing even more. I get along with other dogs. I also get along with kids but I am so active and playful I would do better in a home with older kids and adults who understand my breed. I need someone committed to providing positive based training for a puppy like me with a LOT of energy and a habit of using my mouth too much. I would probably do best in a home that isnt very stressful and chaotic as I will pick up on that energy and become overexcited. \n\n \n\nPlease keep in mind that I am a young HERDING BREED; I still require correction for my mouthiness and do need an owner that understands my inherent instincts. \n\n*Homeownership Required!\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

He can get snappy with other pups when he is first introduced, but as soon as he realizes the other dog isn't a threat, he plays with no issues. He is nervous in the city and would do best in a quiet single family home in a low traffic area. \n\nGeoffrey is an amazing dog, and he will make a wonderful best friend.\n\nPlease Note: All dogs currently available for adoption are posted on our website.

He loves to play all day with his foster siblings. At 1.5 years old, he has plenty of energy, but also enjoys being a couch potato when he's all played out. He is very food motivated and loves going for car rides. Starsky has been wonderful with other dogs, cats and kids of all ages. \n\nHe is looking for an active home with an adopter home often or one who can help build his crate training and confidence over time due to his anxiety (barking) when left alone. Toys and bones have kept him occupied have helped him settle, but he will need more training in adoption. He is a very sweet boy who is eager to please his humans.. He can pull on a leash out of excitement when meeting another dog on walks and will need additional leash training. \n\nStarsky is a wonderful pup ready to find his furever home!\n\nAge: 1.5 yrs\nWeight: 52 lbs.\n\nPlease Note: All dogs currently available for adoption are posted on our website. If you cannot find a particular dog on our website, he/she may be on a temporary foster hold. All dogs are otherwise posted until they are officially adopted. This dog may have other interested adopters in line. If you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application.\n\nQuestions? Please email adoptions@lasthopek9.org. For more photos, or information on upcoming adoption events where you can meet her, please go to www.lasthopek9.org or go to our Facebook page. Thank you for your interest in saving a life!",

            "description": "This beautiful beagle mix pair will be traveling to Seattle in search of \na home and will only be placed together, not as a single beagle. Alfie and Amber were born in a \u201ckill pound\u201d in South Korea in 2017. Sadly, their mother died giving birth. The babies came to the attention of Beagle Rescue Network and were moved to their safe shelter. The third pup was adopted, but Amber and Alfie have never had adopter interest and have no chance of finding a home in Korea. \nThey are both friendly with people and love attention. We don\u2019t know about cats so they probably should have a no cat home. Amber and Alfie have not had experience with children and would be best in a home with older children or no children. They are larger than most beagles and  are both overweight at almost 50 pounds but with a fenced yard for play and lots of walks, they will lose those extra pounds. They are currently in a foster home in Korea waiting for flight arrangements.\nAlfie will need surgery for a luxating patella. Seattle Beagle Rescue will cover the surgery costs. If you have a place in your heart and home for Amber and Alfie, the adoption link is below. \nwww.beaglerescue.org/adoption-form\n\nPicture of pups was from 2017 showing the litter of 3.  The trip-colored beagle was their mom.  \n\nAlfie and Amber are available and the adoption fee is $400 for the pair. If you are interested in him or any of the beagles available through Seattle Beagle Rescue, the first step is to fill out our adoption form at https://www.beaglerescue.org/adoption-process-1 and tell us a little bit about yourself. \n\nAll of our dogs are in foster homes as we do not have a shelter. We are in desperate need of foster homes. We are having to turn down dogs that need us for a lack of foster homes. If you live in a house, have children that are at least school age, and want to give a temporary home to a desperate dog, please fill out our foster home application. https://www.beaglerescue.org/foster-form You will make a needy beagle very happy.",

My foster home is great \u2014 I have a canine brother, two feline sisters, lots of comfy dog beds, and a Kong toy I just love. I happily keep myself busy with it until I get tired and have a little nap. Here\u2019s a thing I can\u2019t quite figure out \u2013 my legs are kind of wobbly, and I have no reflex on my paws. I\u2019m not sure why but the humans around me are talking lots about it and saying that I\u2019m gonna have to get some tests done. I\u2019m not too bothered by it and can still run and enjoy exploring and playing, but stairs are something I cannot handle by myself. Hopefully the tests will help figure me out, and then I will let you know straight away. Nonetheless, I\u2019m ready anytime if you want to meet me. I\u2019d certainly love to meet you and show you what a happy, loving and gentle pup I am.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this pooch, please download the Adoption Questionnaire (farescue.org/pdf_files/questionnaire_canine.pdf), fill it out and email it back to us at info@farescue.org or fax (310) 362-0321. You can also meet this and/or other available dogs at our weekend adoptions.\n\n[Wesley is about 1 year old and weighs 68 lbs.]\n\n(2101)",

This sweet youngster is a very quick learner. As a strong girl, she's learning to take it easier on those daily walks she loves. She pays no attention to other dogs she sees on her walks, but in her foster home she loves playing with her two doggie housemates. And at home, she also loves playing tug-o-war and chewing bones and toys. She'll even pick up sticks in the yard to chew. She already answers to 'sit' and 'down,' and she's nicely house-trained. Myah will be a great addition to an energetic family who can give her the attention she loves, and continue her puppy training. She's a jumpy girl, so kids over 5 may be best. She'd also love a dog playmate. Come meet this adorable girl!",

            "description": "Introducing Lasha, a gorgeous, sweet 4-year-old, housetrained Lab, Retriever mix. Lasha lives in a foster home and does not see many dogs on her walks. However, she is friendly and curious with the dogs she meets and would probably do well in a home with other dogs. Lasha is new to her foster family and hasn't been left alone as of yet, but she is fine at night when left on the dog bed. Lasha has not been in a crate, but loves her spot in the bed and will not roam around the house. She is a well-behaved girl and very well-mannered. She has been free to roam at night in the living room, but rarely leaves her spot. She's a very quiet dog and she would likely be fine on her own while you're out and about running your errands. Lasha is the sweetest girl! She loves attention and back scratches and will give you kisses if you let her. She is very interested in other people and pets outside of her foster home. She lives in a high traffic area so she gets a little distracted by all the surroundings, but generally does well. She is heartworm positive, but all that means is that she will need a couple months of rest while she is being treated at APAs! Expense, and after that she will be as good as new. Lasha is not a fan of elevators, and would prefer a home on the ground floor or one that is accessible by stairs. Lasha is great on a leash and is non-reactive to the sights and sounds of the downtown area where she lives. She listens well and stops at the curbs before crossing the street. She is also very playful and loves to run. She gets interested and excited when encountering another runner, biker, or dog, but is able to keep moving and is polite and respectful. Lasha enjoys snoozing on her bed, eating a big meal, going outside for morning and night time walks and/or runs. She LOVES going out for walks and running on the path outside of her foster home. Lasha is easy going and would fit well in most homes, with the exception of ones with lots of stairs and elevators. She would do well in a home or an apartment as she is not a barker, and she would enjoy a home where she gets regular walks or runs, but is very mellow and quiet and will curl up on her bed when she is not being active. Would you like to take walks with this sweet good-natured girl? Come meet Lasha today!",

Warby is housetrained and does well in a crate. He's also a smart boy who knows the commands 'sit, 'drop, and 'come here. He will usually behave himself when left alone for a bit, but he would much rather be with his human. Warby wags his tail at the cats he lives with, and dogs he sees on walks. He would love to keep improving his leash skills and impulse control with you! Warby is a big boy who needs to get his energy out every day. He can do well with or without a yard as long as he gets plenty of walks and some playtime. Warby would prefer a home where someone is with him most of the time, whether giving him attention or just being in the same room as him. As a smart boy he would also love to have toys that will keep him occupied and stimulated. Warby would love to keep you company and be your best friend. Come meet this silly sweetheart and give him a forever home! See Warby's silly antics on Instagram @austin.doggo.warby.",

He has had a rough life and we are so grateful that we rescued him and will now have an amazing home. He needs YOU! Can you help him? He's a very sweet and petite boy who is cautious but wants to trust again and he needs all the love in the world you have to give!! He's about 4-5yrs old and has the most adorable little face with sad soulful brown eyes just begging for help, begging for real love and desperate for the wonderful home he deserves! It's his turn! He was gonna be left by his owner when moving so the neighbor took him in but he got yet another horrible owner that ended up surrendering him to the shelter. He's been scared and had to go to boarding as our foster had backed out. He needs time to feel free, loved and cared for.  He good on the leash and has a cute swaying wiggle when he trots on his walks. He'd be best with no young kids in the home and someone to work from home if possible to give him all the attention he's missed out on or at least gone a minimal amount of time. He's neutered, vaccinated and chipped and waiting on you!!! Please don't make this sweet boy wait any longer!",

I was surrendered in the shelter due to severe tooth abscess in both side, my cheeks were swollen, oozing with pus caused by ulceration. I was very painful and my mouth has had foul odor that makes an entire room stink/smell so bad. My owner was suffering of dementia, lost his home and can no longer take care of me. Today, I am fully vetted and healthy, my dental treatment done and resolved, I don't stink anymore, I'm up to date with all my shots, microchipped and spayed. Just like a puppy, I have so much love to give and because of what I've been through I am forever grateful to anyone who will adopt and love me. I am perfect to anyone who needs a loyal companion. I love to sit next to my humans while relaxing, watching TV or listening to music, I can be playful at times if I want to, I like  the car rides as well, walk on a leash, sit on your lap, snuggle or cuddle.",

Sherwood would love a yard, seems do to well with other dogs and we've had limited exposure to cats but seemed to leave them alone. He would do well with an active family to help him keep his energy directed to walks, hikes etc. He's learned some commands and is a smart little guy.\n\n$425 adoption fee (includes microchip, deworming, vaccines up to date, and neutered). We accept venmo, cash, checks \n\nApplications must be received before meets are set up. If you rent, please be ready to provide proof you are allowed to have a pet. \nCOVID UPDATE: We are not currently doing adoptions to Canada. We're sorry for the inconvenience.\n\nWe do not EVER ship dogs. \n\nTo apply please go to www.mainstreetmuttrescue.com and click on Adopt. If you click her picture the application should come up. \n\nYou can also apply at https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/MSMR/Dog (this will come up as generic so please try to use the one on our website first!",

            "description": "This adorable boy is Loki, a 9 year old, male Hound mix - possibly Vizsla - who currently weighs about 35 pounds. He was starved prior to rescue so he's been steadily gaining weight. Loki is not only handsome, he is such a happy, joy-filled, easy going dog whose tail never stops wagging. Loki will follow you around just to be sure you know he's there. He likes cuddling and getting his belly scratched, but is also independent enough where he enjoys some alone time. Loki gets along with every person he meets and gets along with most other dogs; he has been very passive with the other dog in his foster home.\n\nLoki absolutely loves going for his long afternoon walks, helping his foster mom reach her 10,000 steps a day on the Fitbit. He definitely needs an active family that loves to play and walk him. We would also like him to have another gentle dog in the home as he loves the companionship of them; Loki doesn't like it when other dogs get in his face. Loki would do best with a 6ft privacy fence because he can be an escape artist. He is a great dog and will make a wonderful family companion. Loki is housebroken, has great home manners, and is crate trained. He is approved for households with children 10 years and older.\n\nThis dog has been examined by a licensed veterinarian, provided inoculations, been neutered, tested for heartworm disease (negative) and placed on monthly preventative, plus microchipped. In addition, we ran a blood panel to check for overall health and Loki has no concerning health issues; he's doing great! ADOPTION APPLICATIONS are available by request directly through email - acaringplace@comcast.net Please do NOT use our website's online application since it is not working properly. A Caring Place - All Breed Dog Rescue adopts throughout the Greater Chicagoland Area. All dogs and puppies live in foster homes, providing you as the adopter, with information on the animal's behaviors, needs, and requirements. We are always in search of fosters care providers. If you are one of those special people willing to open your heart and home to an animal in need and would like to receive information on how you can foster an animal, please contact us.",

He needs a confident handler as Gru can be strong-willed on leash. He would do well with another dog or dogs in the home but while he's learning his manners, no small children. He is a handsome and soft boy with a big personality, very affectionate once comfortable.\n\nAdoption Info: Adoption fee is $500, which includes spay/neuter, current rabies/DAPPV/bordetella vaccinations, microchip, health certificate, heartworm test, and flight from Hawaii. All adoption fees are donations to a Washington non-profit corporation and all donations go to benefit the animals in our rescue.\n\nApply online at www.DogGoneSeattle.org\n\nAnimal History: This dog was transferred from our Texas rescue partner. This dog will be available for adoption in Seattle once evaluated.",

            "description": "Bonded Pair!\nSayde and Oz are 5-6 years old and weigh 30-35 pounds each. Oz is the male, he is deaf, very loving and cautious. He was attached to me from the beginning (his foster) and will be an excellent companion. Sayde is the female and is blind in one eye. The vet believes it is from an old eye injury that was not taken care of. She is also very loving and snuggly. They have adapted to living in doors but we think that they were mostly outdoor dogs, they did not know how to use the stairs or what a glass door was. They are great walkers and will be excellent for a family without other dogs. They are bonded and believe to be siblings. Their adoption fee is $295 each and covers the cost of their spay/neuter, all core vaccines (Rabies and Distemper/Parvo), microchips and microchip registrations.\n\nIf this listing is still posted, we are still accepting applications for he/she. We do not do out-of-state adoptions on highly adoptable dogs; we would only consider out-of-state adoptions for dogs that prove hard-to-place locally. We do not hold dogs, please submit your application when you are ready to adopt.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting any Poochmatch dog, please visit our website to complete an adoption application. It is in the ADOPTION folder at the top of our home page. Just fill in the blanks and SEND.\nWe commonly receive multiple applications for a single dog. Nevertheless, only one applicant will be invited to meet a dog on Saturday at Petsmart in Yorba Linda between noon and 3 pm OR on a mutually agreeable day, time and place during the week.\n\nAll adoption fees cover the mandatory and non-negotiable spay/neuter, rabies, microchip, microchip registration, full sets of core vaccinations (rabies and 1 set of distemper/parvo for adults, 4 for puppies) and deworming. Adoption fees vary based on age, breed, size and the costs incurred on the dog's behalf by us i.e. medical, behavioral training, etc. and they range from $295-$495.",

He was attached to me from the beginning (his foster) and will be an excellent companion. Sayde is the female and is blind in one eye. The vet believes it is from an old eye injury that was not taken care of. She is also very loving and snuggly. They have adapted to living in doors but we think that they were mostly outdoor dogs, they did not know how to use the stairs or what a glass door was. They are great walkers and will be excellent for a family without other dogs. They are bonded and believe to be siblings. Their adoption fee is $295 each and covers the cost of their spay/neuter, all core vaccines (Rabies and Distemper/Parvo), microchips and microchip registrations.\n\nIf this listing is still posted, we are still accepting applications for he/she. We do not do out-of-state adoptions on highly adoptable dogs; we would only consider out-of-state adoptions for dogs that prove hard-to-place locally. We do not hold dogs, please submit your application when you are ready to adopt.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting any Poochmatch dog, please visit our website to complete an adoption application. It is in the ADOPTION folder at the top of our home page. Just fill in the blanks and SEND.\nWe commonly receive multiple applications for a single dog. Nevertheless, only one applicant will be invited to meet a dog on Saturday at Petsmart in Yorba Linda between noon and 3 pm OR on a mutually agreeable day, time and place during the week.\n\nAll adoption fees cover the mandatory and non-negotiable spay/neuter, rabies, microchip, microchip registration, full sets of core vaccinations (rabies and 1 set of distemper/parvo for adults, 4 for puppies) and deworming. Adoption fees vary based on age, breed, size and the costs incurred on the dog's behalf by us i.e. medical, behavioral training, etc. and they range from $295-$495.",

She is doing great in foster care. She loves playing with her toys and the other dogs in the house. She does well with the 2 legged people in her life, although she is a still quite bitey and her teeth are sharp, lots of redirecting with toys on hand are help curb that. She is getting used to her kennel and learning to potty outside. She is doing well potty training wise, and taken out very consistently. She settles well in her kennel after she has been able to get out her energy. She can be barky in it if she isn't worn out. She is super sweet and loves to snuggle in your lap for a nap.",

So please do apply.\n\n\nTake a chance on Abba! This quiet, delicate girl has a dream, a dream about a warm loving home where she can feel safe and secure. If you have cozy beds, blankets and comfy sweaters for her, even better! She can't wait for you to lay all your love on her!\n\n* HERE'S WHAT ABBA'S FOSTER MOM HAS TO SAY! *\n\nSweet little Abba has done QUITE the turnaround from the terribly scared, shaking girl we picked up a few days ago! She is an absolute LOVE - she has lots of energy and loves her food (especially chicken!).\n\nShe is a GREAT walker! She keeps a brisk pace and can go a good distance, she can even take stairs on her own - up and down. She also loves to sit in our laps. She is housebroken and doesn't bark (am I describing a dream dog, or what?) She will whimper softly to get our attention, some loving rubs calms her right down. She seems to be a dog who wants/needs a lot of companionship and in return, she'll be a sweet and loving companion,",

            "description": "Meet Bounce!\n\n13-year-old Bounce came to us from Orange County Shelter on December 3rd. He weighs 21 lbs. Bounce had two delicate surgeries in December to correct a perineal hernia. Our vet had to made it a two-part surgery, because Bounce had so many organs stuck in his hernia! We are so thankful this resilient little guy has recovered from both surgeries and is feeling great!\n\nBounce can be reserved in the play yard with all the other little dogs and will not be the first to greet you, which can cause him to be overlooked by potential adopters. However, away from all the hustle bustle of the play yard, his cute personality begins to emerge! Volunteers recently took him to Liberty Station in San Diego and as soon as Bounce's little feet touched the ground, his face lit up, and he was so happy to walk. They reported that he walks so well - lightly and loosely (with slack) on leash. As you can see in the video, Bounce literally bounces!\n\nBounce rides perfectly in the car, looking out the window and napping. He is very gentle when taking treats and politely sits while people are eating. He gets along with other dogs, both at FFF and when he went on the outing.\n\nBounce is ready for a Forever Family! Apply here to meet him: www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nVisit us at Open House: Saturdays & Sundays, 10 am - 1 pm. CANCELLED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE DUE TO COVID-19\n\nLearn more about our programs at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family. No adoption fees, and we help with medical costs!\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\nUpdated: 1/18/21 KG",

Choco is house trained and crate trained. \n\nChoco is full of puppy love and energy! He loves to play and does well with other dogs, although like most puppies he still needs to be corrected and continue to learn how to have good play manners. Choco tends to form strong bonds with his female caregiver and can be slow to trust men. He will need a home that will continue to work on introducing him to knew people and continue to properly socialize and train him. He may do best in a single person home or with a couple. Choco would love to have a playful furry sibling who can teach him all about being a confident dog. He will also need continued training and structure to thrive. He is very intelligent which will be a huge asset for further training but like most working dogs he will need continued enrichment to stay stimulated and out of trouble! \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adopting Choco fill out an application today! \nwww.bullluvablepaws.org/adopt",

            "description": "Dudley is an Italian Greyhound/Jack Russell mix estimated at 2 years old. Dudley MUST have a 6 ft privacy fence and a home with no children under the age of 10.\n\nAn apartment will NOT work for him. He also requires a family that will work with him and be patient and understanding of his separation anxiety. When he is comfortable with someone, Dudley is a happy, loving boy who snuggles as close as possible and gives sweet kisses.\n\nLike a typical Jack Russell, he has a lot of energy and would love a home that takes him on long, daily walks. Dudley is very smart and needs mental stimulation with training and playing.\n\nHe was known to dig out of his previous home's fence and can easily clear a shorter fence and baby gate, which is one reason why he requires a privacy fence. If he sees a squirrel, he WILL do everything he can to get to it. Dudley is very skittish of new people and sounds and is an extreme flight risk, darting through a door faster than you can blink. He needs a secure harness and/or collar when on walks or in an unfenced area because he will suddenly back up or try to run if he's startled by a person or sound. Another reason a fence is required is that his potty habits would likely significantly decline without a fence, especially in bad weather. He relies on the fast, easy access to the yard to be successful at this point.\n\nDudley is working on his potty habits and does pretty well when taken out regularly.\n\nLike most Italian greyhounds, however, he does not like bad weather, so needs extra encouragement to go on those days. His foster parents are keeping a belly band on him when he cannot be monitored as he has shown some marking behavior. Dudley loves to eat and loves to eat other dogs' food if given the chance, so he needs to be fed separately.\n\nAfter a couple weeks with his foster family, Dudley now sleeps quietly in his crate through the night, as long as the crate is in the room with the family.\n\nHowever, Dudley cannot be crated when his foster family has to leave for work or errands, as he will panic and destroy the crate, even risking his safety.\n\nDudley is a loving, friendly, active dog who needs a special home to help him thrive. An adopter with Jack Russell Terrier and Italian Greyhound breed experience is preferred. He cannot go to a home that will be gone long hours, and especially a home that will be transitioning from working at home to working at the office as a result of the pandemic, as this would be extremely stressful for him.\n\nDudley has been neutered and is up-to-date on his immunizations.\n\nOut-of-state applications are not being considered at this time.",

Having someone with them every 4 hours until they are older greatly facilitates the housebreaking process\n\nIf you are not yet approved to adopt from All Shepherd Rescue, please fill out our online application at www.allshepherdrescue.com. Our adoption fee is $300.00.",

            "description": "The Golden Girls Allie and Cora\n\nMeet Allie and Cora, transplants all the way from Mississippi. \n\nAllie and Cora are approximately five and a half to six months old. They were found along with their mother Pearl (adopted by Mississippi foster mom) a black lab, starving on a backwoods Road in Northeast mississippi.\n\nAllie and Cora spent two and a half months in their Mississippi foster home gaining weight and being showered with love and attention, something they never had. *Side note, foster mom moved to Mississippi 11 months ago from north West Indiana and has been involved in animal welfare and rescue for 33 years, which is why these girls were sent up north. Sadly, there is a HUGE amount of abandoned, abused, neglected and starved dogs down south thrown away like trash. \n\nThe girls now reside until adopted, with our founder, Jean.\n\nThe Golden Girls are Facebook famous! Their foster mom shared their photo taken with the neighborhood UPS man on the Facebook page \"UPS dogs\" garnering over 16,000 likes/loves in just under an hour.\n\nMom is a black lab. Dad appeared to be a retriever/hound mix. Physically, Allie takes more after the lab/hound side, whereas Cora takes after the lab/retriever side.\n\nAllie is outgoing and bold. Cora is more shy, reserved and whines when excited. Both love people and other dogs and are very good watch dogs, even at their young age. The girls are very rambunctious puppies who love one another very much. Though very bonded and our wish is for them to be adopted together, they can be separated.\n\nThey both need more leash training and obedience school would do wonders for any new puppy or dog. The girls are crate trained, working on house potty training and do great on a schedule as their Mississippi foster home operated on a schedule. They lived with multiple dogs of all sizes, breeds and ages. They were submissive and if they became over rambunctious and an adult dog corrected them, they respected the correction, especially their mom's. \n\nOur adoptable pets must live INSIDE the HOME as part of the family!\n\nThe girls are current on all vaccinations including rabies, Spayed, dewormed and microchipped. Their adoption fee is $350 for a single adoption or $500 if you adopt the pair.\n\nPlease email Jean at cryforhelprescue@gmail.com to inquire. A completed adoption application and excellent vet references for past and current pets required before a meet and greet will be considered. A home visit is required for any adoption and can be done during the meet and greet for an approved applicant.",

            "description": "Say hello to your new best friend!\n\nMilo is a very young Anatolian Shepard/Husky mix who is very playful but also loves his naps! He is one pup from a litter of 9 to their husky mom. \n\nMilo's mama produced a few litters for her caretakers before being dumped and left to fend for herself. Her rescuer discovered she was expecting before they could get her spayed and asked POPP for help. Mama (Luna) and all her pups have been well cared for and are now ready to start lives with their furever families. \n\nBoth Huskies and Anatolian Shepherds have some unique breed traits so we are looking for people familiar with the breeds. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting Milo, his adoption fee is $200. He will be neutered, microchipped and vaccines started. Here is a link to our adoption questionnaire: https://www.popptricities.org/adopt/adoption-questionnaire-canine/",

He is one pup from a litter of 9 to their husky mom. \n\nKoda's mama produced a few litters for her caretakers before being dumped and left to fend for herself. Her rescuer discovered she was expecting before they could get her spayed and asked POPP for help. Mama (Luna) and all her pups have been well cared for and are now ready to start lives with their furever families. \n\nBoth Huskies and Anatolian Shepherds have some unique breed traits so we are looking for people familiar with the breeds. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting Koda, his adoption fee is $200. He will be neutered, microchipped and vaccines started. Here is a link to our adoption questionnaire: https://www.popptricities.org/adopt/adoption-questionnaire-cani",

He is one pup from a litter of 9 to their husky mom. \n\nBenny's mama produced a few litters for her caretakers before being dumped and left to fend for herself. Her rescuer discovered she was expecting before they could get her spayed and asked POPP for help. Mama (Luna) and all her pups have been well cared for and are now ready to start lives with their furever families. \n\nBoth Huskies and Anatolian Shepherds have some unique breed traits so we are looking for people familiar with the breeds. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting Benny, his adoption fee is $200. He will be neutered, microchipped and vaccines started. Here is a link to our adoption questionnaire: https://www.popptricities.org/adopt/adoption-questionnaire-canine/",

She is one pup from a litter of 9 to their husky mom. \n\nDaisy's mama produced a few litters for her caretakers before being dumped and left to fend for herself. Her rescuer discovered she was expecting before they could get her spayed and asked POPP for help. Mama (Luna) and all her pups have been well cared for and are now ready to start lives with their furever families. \n\nBoth Huskies and Anatolian Shepherds have some unique breed traits so we are looking for people familiar with the breeds. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting Daisy, her adoption fee is $200. She will be spayed, microchipped and vaccines started. Here is a link to our adoption questionnaire: https://www.popptricities.org/adopt/adoption-questionnaire-canine/",

Kandi will require 2 separate orthopedic surgeries to repair her cruciate ligaments.  She will be in foster care for a period of at least one year as she will need to be medically cleared for adoption as well as be fully vetted through the rescue.\n\nKandi is a very sweet 11 month old Chocolate Labrador Retriever.  She is currently overweight and will need to lose approximately 15 pounds.  Her current weight is 80 pounds and she should be approximately 65 pounds.\n\nWe are looking for a serious foster, with the intention once she is medically cleared, to adopt home.\n\nHer home should be a quiet home as she will require crate rest and to be kept low key.  There will be a rehabilitation plan for each surgery that the foster to adopt must follow.  This includes specific rehabilitation exercises to be done at home in a specific time period.\n\nThe foster to adopt must be willing to take her to her follow up appointments as well as taking her to and from her second surgery.\n\nWe are looking for a home that is within a 1/2 hour radius of the Hamilton area.  The main vet is located in the Hamilton, Ontario area and the orthopedic vet is located in Etobicoke.  \n\nA fenced in secure yard is a must.\n\nWe are looking for a foster to adopt home where Kandi is not left alone for long periods of time.\n\nMust be 25 years or older.\n\nA home where there is not a lot of stairs is a requirement as Kandi will not initially be able to do stairs.\n\nIf you are interested in becoming Kandi's foster to adopt home please send us an email at deannaaarfrescue@yahoo.ca and tell us a bit about yourself and why you would be a suitable fit for her.\n\nWe will not respond to emails that are asking if she is still available.  If the petfinder post is up we are still looking for a suitable foster to adopt home.\n",

Our Rescue Coordinator tells us:\n\"Lady and Tramp are a bonded pair.  They have been through so much together, including having Archie, Betty and Veronica -- the three puppies we adopted out in December!  (Some of you may remember them!)  This sweet couple are now both healthy and ready for their Fur-Ever Home.\"\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about Tramp , please first fill out and send us an Adoption Application Form.  This greatly helps us in determining the best fit for this animal.  We must have this information before we can proceed further.  If it looks like you and Tramp  might be a good match, we will link you up with his Foster Family for more information and/or to arrange a meet-and-greet.\n\n(Our Adoption Application Form is on our website at www.fur-ever-home.org, or you can get to it by clicking the \"More About Fur-Ever Home\" button on this page, then clicking the \"Adoption Application\" button that appears.)",

They were both found wondering the streets and found themselves in our shelter on 1/26. Angela has a chip, but the owners did not come to the shelter to pick them up. These two are very sweet and loving dogs; all they want to do is play and soak up all the attention! Angela and Forest are calm and easy-going dogs. They both know their simple commands, so with a little TLC and time, they can learn more tricks, manners, and develop that beautiful family bond! Although Angela and Forest would love to stay together, they will also be very happy in separate, loving homes. Stop by the shelter to meet and fall in love with Angela in run 79. Her ID number is 627048. Angela is up-to-date on vaccines, microchipped, and spayed. She will be heart worm tested upon adoption. Angela can't wait to start loving her new family with all 45 pounds of her being! Please see Forest's profile for more information.\n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information. Shelter hours are: Tues. - Sun. 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. by appointment only until further notice, CLOSED Mondays & Holidays.",

I had 9 healthy puppies and they are my last (yay!). Now I get to be someone's best friend!\n\nI am calm yet very alert, I love to go for walks, I have a favorite toy (I've not had one of those before!) oh and I love food and snacks too!\n\nI have been spayed, microchipped and vaccinated.

He is such a good boy I can not imagine having to give up a dog like him. He is easy to be around, not a barker and really pretty quiet. Bubba is playful and fun to be around. He can be a bit shy until he gets to know you. He loves toys, wrestling with other dogs and going for walks. And treats of course! Bubba still has some puppyish habits and will tear up tissue paper etc on the floor so he does need to be watched. He is \"close\" to housetrained but his owners admitted they were inconsistent with him. Bubba is a bit too curious about cats and would probably do best living in a cat free home. We have not had him around kids much but he overall has such a nice temperament that he should be ok at least with older kids. Bubba's ideal home would be in a home as an only dog. He could also be in a home with one dog but he is initially fearful of new dogs. This can sometimes lead to being a little too aggressive with them. He was in a home as an only dog and is just learning proper etiquette around other dogs. \n\nBubba is a coated breed (hair grows continuously) so he will require professional grooming every 6-8 weeks. \n\nBubba's adoption fee is $450\n\nThis fee includes at least one health exam at our veterinarian while in our care, altering, all vaccinations including rabies (as permitted by age), a pre-adoption professional grooming and a microchip with lifetime membership that never will cost you a fee. \n All dogs also leave with a new collar and or harness and leash as well as a gift bag which includes among other things, a starter bag of the quality kibble that is being fed at the rescue.\nAdoption fees also allow us the ability to put funds towards the next homeless or unwanted dog in need of rescue!\n\nIf you'd like to considered to for this adoption or any of our amazing rescues, please fill our the application with the help of this link. https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/AZST/Dog.\n\nWe review each application carefully. Please understand that sometimes we get numerous applications for particular dogs and as a volunteer based rescue we do not always have the time to respond to each and every one. We do our best to choose the most suitable home for each dog based on their specific personality and needs. \n\nDue to Covid, we are very short handed and may not contact you for up to a week to set up a meet and greet if your application is chosen. We appreciate all applicants and do our best to pair ever dog and family for a successful and happy life.",

            "description": "Midnight is one of the more interesting dogs we have come across in rescue. He is essentially a Mini Doodle of sorts. His original owners purchased him and his brother from an unscrupulous breeder. He and his brother were sold to their owners as \"Maltipoo's\" which is a combination of Maltese and Poodle. The owner's wanted two littermates who would not exceed 10 lbs and that is what they were told they were getting. It quickly became apparent that the dogs, particularly Midnight, were growing at an alarming rate! The owner's decided to send in the DNA of both dogs to have them tested to see what breeds they truly were. As it turns out, they were not even brothers and neither dog had Maltese or Poodle in them! Nevertheless, Midnight is a delightful boy who they decided to give up while he was still young since he was going to be WAY too big for them. Midnight is a combination of over 18 breeds according to his DNA. He ranges from a variety of large breeds like German Shepherd (16%) and Old English Sheepdog 12% to an array of small breeds like Pomeranian (10%) and Silky Terrier (8%). While we have NO idea how this came to be, he is a remarkable, adorable, funny, plunky puppy just waiting for the perfect home. We estimate he will be around 35-40 lbs although he has proven FULL of surprises. This is a fair estimate based on his weight of around 25 lbs at 4 1/2 months. \n\nMidnight is a coated breed (hair grows continuously) so he will require professional grooming periodically. He may shed minimally. \n\nMidnight is not completely housetrained but does not potty in his crate and holds it all night. \nWith some consistency and persistence he should be easy to completely housetrain. \n\nMidnight's adoption fee is $650\n\nThis fee includes at least one health exam at our veterinarian while in our care, altering, all vaccinations including rabies (as permitted by age), a pre-adoption professional grooming and a microchip with lifetime membership that never will cost you a fee. \n All dogs also leave with a new collar and or harness and leash as well as a gift bag which includes among other things, a starter bag of the quality kibble that is being fed at the rescue.\nAdoption fees also allow us the ability to put funds towards the next homeless or unwanted dog in need of rescue!\n\nIf you'd like to considered to for this adoption or any of our amazing rescues, please fill our the application with the help of this link. https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/AZST/Dog.\n\nWe review each application carefully. Please understand that sometimes we get numerous applications for particular dogs and as a volunteer based rescue we do not always have the time to respond to each and every one. We do our best to choose the most suitable home for each dog based on their specific personality and needs. \n\nDue to Covid, we are very short handed and may not contact you for up to a week to set up a meet and greet if your application is chosen. We appreciate all applicants and do our best to pair ever dog and family for a successful and happy life.",

            "description": "Cinder's is an adorable Chihuahua who came from a hoarding situation. She is very sweet and fairly outgoing which is a bit surprising given her background. She arrived with very little training but she is a very smart girl and eager to please. She is not as fearful or nervous as many Chihuahuas and she is not at all barky. Cinder's is approximately 1 1/2 years old and weighs about 7 lbs. She has striking marking that make her very unique. Cinder's is learning to walk on the leash and she rides well in the car. She gets along with all of the other dogs, seems fine with cats and seems to like everybody. She is a bit shy meeting new people but will warm up quickly. Cinders would love a family of her own, perhaps with another dog her size or maybe with older children. She has some catching up to do in the LOVE department! \n\nCinders is a short haired breed and will require some brushing and regular nail trims. \n\nLike many of the dogs in rescue, we do not know how well house trained Cinders is but she does not ever potty in her crate and waits to go outside. Some patience and consistency taking her out with you and giving her lots of praise will go a long way with this sweet girl. \n\nCinder's adoption fee is $275\n\nThis fee includes at least one health exam at our veterinarian while in our care, altering, all vaccinations including rabies (as permitted by age), a pre-adoption professional grooming and a microchip with lifetime membership that never will cost you a fee. \n All dogs also leave with a new collar and or harness and leash as well as a gift bag which includes among other things, a starter bag of the quality kibble that is being fed at the rescue.\nAdoption fees also allow us the ability to put funds towards the next homeless or unwanted dog in need of rescue!\n\nIf you'd like to considered to for this adoption or any of our amazing rescues, please fill our the application with the help of this link. https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/AZST/Dog.\n\nWe review each application carefully. Please understand that sometimes we get numerous applications for particular dogs and as a volunteer based rescue we do not always have the time to respond to each and every one.

He is inseparable from his soulmate Lady.  Our Rescue Coordinator tells us:\n\"Lady and Tramp are a bonded pair.  They have been through so much together, including having Archie, Betty and Veronica -- the three puppies we adopted out in December!  (Some of you may remember them!)  This sweet couple are now both healthy and ready for their Fur-Ever Home.\"\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about Tramp, please first fill out and send us an Adoption Application Form.  This greatly helps us in determining the best fit for this animal.  We must have this information before we can proceed further.  If it looks like you and Tramp  might be a good match, we will link you up with his Foster Family for more information and/or to arrange a meet-and-greet.\n\n(Our Adoption Application Form is on our website at www.fur-ever-home.org, or you can get to it by clicking the \"More About Fur-Ever Home\" button on this page, then clicking the \"Adoption Application\" button that appears.)",

They\u2019re about 5 lbs currently and expected to be in the medium to large size range when full grown. These little celebrities are good with other dogs, kids and cats. They\u2019re in foster homes working of house training and their puppy manners. These puppies will be ready for their furever homes next week (week of 2/7), but we are now accepting applications.\n\nPlease note: as with most rescue puppies, we have no way to guarantee this puppy\u2019s breed or size potential. \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for puppies covers initial deworming,  puppy vaccinations, microchip, and spay/neuter at the rescue's approved vet at 6 months of age. Please see our website for more information.\n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq\n\n*Any breed labels used by Take Paws Rescue, its employees/volunteers, or on vet records provided cannot be guaranteed.  Breed labels are given based on information obtained during intake and/or best guesses based on appearance and/or temperament of the dogs and Take Paws Rescue gives no assurance to the accuracy of these labels. Labels are necessary for postings to many animal networking sites, such as Pet Finder, and are no way a guarantee. Additionally, exact age and potential size cannot be guaranteed.",

They\u2019re about 5 lbs currently and expected to be in the medium to large size range when full grown. These little celebrities are good with other dogs, kids and cats. They\u2019re in foster homes working of house training and their puppy manners. These puppies will be ready for their furever homes next week (week of 2/7), but we are now accepting applications.\n\nPlease note: as with most rescue puppies, we have no way to guarantee this puppy\u2019s breed or size potential. \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for puppies covers initial deworming,  puppy vaccinations, microchip, and spay/neuter at the rescue's approved vet at 6 months of age. Please see our website for more information.\n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq\n\n*Any breed labels used by Take Paws Rescue, its employees/volunteers, or on vet records provided cannot be guaranteed.  Breed labels are given based on information obtained during intake and/or best guesses based on appearance and/or temperament of the dogs and Take Paws Rescue gives no assurance to the accuracy of these labels. Labels are necessary for postings to many animal networking sites, such as Pet Finder, and are no way a guarantee. Additionally, exact age and potential size cannot be guaranteed.",

            "description": "Meet this sweet, 3 year old boy named Forest! Forest came into the shelter with his partner-in-crime, Angela. They were both found wondering the streets and found themselves in our shelter on 1/26. Angela has a chip, but the owners did not come to the shelter to pick them up. These two are very sweet and loving dogs; all they want to do is play and soak up all the attention! Forest and Angela are calm and easy-going dogs. They both know their simple commands, so with a little TLC and time, they can learn more tricks, manners, and develop that beautiful family bond! Although Forest and Angela would love to stay together, they will also be very happy in separate, loving homes. Stop by the shelter to meet and fall in love with Forest in run 79. His ID number is 627047. Forest is up-to-date on vaccines, and he will be neutered, microchipped, and heart worm tested upon adoption. Forest can't wait to start loving his new family with all 55 pounds of his being! Please see Angela's profile for more information.\n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information. Shelter hours are: Tues. - Sun. 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. by appointment only until further notice, CLOSED Mondays & Holidays.",

They\u2019re about 5 lbs currently and expected to be in the medium to large size range when full grown. These little celebrities are good with other dogs, kids and cats. They\u2019re in foster homes working of house training and their puppy manners. These puppies will be ready for their furever homes next week (week of 2/7), but we are now accepting applications.\n\nPlease note: as with most rescue puppies, we have no way to guarantee this puppy\u2019s breed or size potential. \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for puppies covers initial deworming,  puppy vaccinations, microchip, and spay/neuter at the rescue's approved vet at 6 months of age. Please see our website for more information.\n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq\n\n*Any breed labels used by Take Paws Rescue, its employees/volunteers, or on vet records provided cannot be guaranteed.  Breed labels are given based on information obtained during intake and/or best guesses based on appearance and/or temperament of the dogs and Take Paws Rescue gives no assurance to the accuracy of these labels. Labels are necessary for postings to many animal networking sites, such as Pet Finder, and are no way a guarantee. Additionally, exact age and potential size cannot be guaranteed.",

            "description": "Timber is a SWEET 1-2 yr old, 50 lb pittie mix. He is fluffy and soft like velvet. He is in the submissive side and willing to follow the lead. He would be great in any household, he\u2019s housebroken and as gentle as they come. He loves to curl up on your lap and \u2018purr\u2019 when you scratch his head. Timber is such a beautiful gray color with light eyes, pictures so nor do him justice!\n\nAdopters must live within a 100-mile radius of Joliet, IL to be considered. The adoption fee is $425. This covers all shots, spay/neutering and microchip.\n\nTo be considered for this dog. Please fill out an application here: https://www.pawsup4rescue.org/dog-cat-applicaiton\n\nOur adoption process typically takes from one to two weeks. When you find an animal you are interested in, we ask that you fill out an application as a first step so we can determine if your family is a good fit for the animal. If you are, then we will contact you to arrange a time for you and your family to meet the animal so you can decide if it is a good fit. If you currently have dogs, we require that the dogs be present at the meeting to make sure it's a good fit all around. Once compatibility is determined, we move on to the paperwork and finalizing the adoption. \n\nIf the meet is not a good fit, we will keep your application on file for up to 1 year and we will gladly consider your family for another dog. \n\nFollow us on FACEBOOK: www.Facebook.com/PawsUp4Rescue/ \nand on INSTAGRAM: www.Instagram.com/Paws_Up_4_Rescue/",

She is one pup from a litter of 9 to their husky mom. \n\nBillie's mama produced a few litters for her caretakers before being dumped and left to fend for herself. Her rescuer discovered she was expecting before they could get her spayed and asked POPP for help. Mama (Luna) and all her pups have been well cared for and are now ready to start lives with their furever families. \n\nBoth Huskies and Anatolian Shepherds have some unique breed traits so we are looking for people familiar with the breeds. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting Billie, her adoption fee is $200. She will be spayed, microchipped and vaccines started. Here is a link to our adoption questionnaire: https://www.popptricities.org/adopt/adoption-questionnaire-canine/",

They\u2019re about 5 lbs currently and expected to be in the medium to large size range when full grown. These little celebrities are good with other dogs, kids and cats. They\u2019re in foster homes working of house training and their puppy manners. These puppies will be ready for their furever homes next week (week of 2/7), but we are now accepting applications.\n\nPlease note: as with most rescue puppies, we have no way to guarantee this puppy\u2019s breed or size potential. \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for puppies covers initial deworming,  puppy vaccinations, microchip, and spay/neuter at the rescue's approved vet at 6 months of age. Please see our website for more information.\n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq\n\n*Any breed labels used by Take Paws Rescue, its employees/volunteers, or on vet records provided cannot be guaranteed.  Breed labels are given based on information obtained during intake and/or best guesses based on appearance and/or temperament of the dogs and Take Paws Rescue gives no assurance to the accuracy of these labels. Labels are necessary for postings to many animal networking sites, such as Pet Finder, and are no way a guarantee. Additionally, exact age and potential size cannot be guaranteed.",

She is one pup from a litter of 9 to their husky mom. \n\nSage's mama produced a few litters for her caretakers before being dumped and left to fend for herself. Her rescuer discovered she was expecting before they could get her spayed and asked POPP for help. Mama (Luna) and all her pups have been well cared for and are now ready to start lives with their furever families. \n\nBoth Huskies and Anatolian Shepherds have some unique breed traits so we are looking for people familiar with the breeds. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting Sage, Her adoption fee is $200. She will be spayed, microchipped and vaccines started. Here is a link to our adoption questionnaire: https://www.popptricities.org/adopt/adoption-questionnaire-canine/",

Canelo is the most active of the pups, is very playful and love cuddling with his siblings. He is one pup from a litter of 9 to their husky mom. \n\nCanelo's mama produced a few litters for her caretakers before being dumped and left to fend for herself. Her rescuer discovered she was expecting before they could get her spayed and asked POPP for help. Mama (Luna) and all her pups have been well cared for and are now ready to start lives with their furever families. \n\nBoth Huskies and Anatolian Shepherds have some unique breed traits so we are looking for people familiar with the breeds. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting Canelo, his adoption fee is $200. He will be neutered, microchipped and vaccines started. Here is a link to our adoption questionnaire: https://www.popptricities.org/adopt/adoption-questionnaire-canine/",

We think they will likely be between 55-70 pounds when full grown.\n\nThey are getting experience living with other dogs but haven't yet spent significant time with kids or cats.\n\nPuppies need someone with the time, energy and patience for house-training and basic obedience. \n\nPuppies under 6 months of age are adopted out on a spay/neuter contract\n\nOur adoption fee includes age appropriate vaccinations, deworming, microchipping and transport expenses. Adoption fee is $450 to help offset travel and medical expenses.\n\nAll children at home should be at least age 5 to be approved for adoption!",

            "description": "Seattle Foster Update :\n\nJack is a friendly outgoing guy! He happily greets new people & dogs. He is looking for a home without kids. Jack knows how to sit already! He also loves to give lots of kisses.\n\nJack is fairly energetic, but he also loves to relax and snuggle -- so overall, mid level energy.\n\nJack is good in the crate and he sometimes goes in on his own, but otherwise can be tempted with a treat. Jack rides well in the car.\n\nWhile Jack is not much of barker, he does like to talk -- sometimes when anxious or sometimes when bored -- pretty typical of what's in his breed mix!\n\nJack does need some work on his leash training. He is very focused on sniffing outside, so sometimes he can pull to get to a spot, and doesn't always come when asked (to continue sniffing a spot). Again, hounds are very nose oriented, but this can be worked on.\n\nJack likes solo play, mostly chewing & fetch, so he would be fine as the only dog in the home, and may even prefer it. He likes kongs! He has played a bit with our resident dog & seems open to it, but we'll know more as his personality comes out.\n\nHe likes to be the center of attention and can get jealous of our resident dog receiving attention. He is respectful of boundaries, including with resident dog though\n\nAnimal Profile:\nJack is an estimated 6-year-old 44 lb male Terrier/Hound mix who will be joining us from Hawaii on January 27th. He is energetic and playful with dogs and loves people. He is looking for an active home without children. We will post more info as we get to know hi\n\nAdoption Info: Adoption fee is $475, which includes spay/neuter, current rabies/DAPPV/bordetella vaccinations, microchip, health certificate, heartworm test, and flight from Hawaii. All adoption fees are donations to a Washington non-profit corporation and all donations go to benefit the animals in our rescue.\n\nApply online at www.DogGoneSeattle.org\n\nAnimal History: This dog was transferred from our Kauai Humane Society rescue partner. This dog will be available for adoption in Seattle once evaluated.",

Bruce is the most laid back, chill dude. His favorite activities include leisurely walks, long naps and scratchies. He loves his humans and tolerates other dogs well but does not prefer their company. Bruce currently lives with a fur foster sister but would prefer to be an only dog in his forever home. He is not especially playful or energetic, he would do well in any type of home, including an apartment as long as he gets his walkies for bathroom breaks. Bruce has a quiet, introverted nature and can be grumpy at times so we do not feel he would be the best match in a home with young children. He is crate trained and does super well on leash. He also does well when left alone and just sleeps in his crate. Bruce would like nothing more than to be your most devoted best friend!\n\nAdoption Info: Adoption fee is $500, which includes spay/neuter, current rabies/DAPPV/bordetella vaccinations, microchip, health certificate, and heartworm test.

All are in the NY/NJ area but we will adopt out of state to the purrfect home and in some cases, we can arrange transport.  Please go to our site zanisfurryfriends.org  and fill out an application \n\nMany of us (cats/dogs) will be on display on Saturdays or Sundays, weather dependent--please ask by writing us at info@zanisfurryfriends.org and following us on FB. If you are seriously interested in adopting one of us in particular, please fill out an application early Friday so that we can be sure to be there. Otherwise we decide based on other variables. Usually we are in our foster homes so this is a bit more stressful and a slightly artificial environment but we do want to be seen and find our furever homes too.\n \nPlease consider providing a home for more than one dog, especially if you are considering adopting a puppy. Dogs are pack animals and very much enjoy as well as need other dog company to learn to play, socialize and be good companion animals to people. The upside to this is that you won't feel as guilty leaving them alone and you get twice the love. Please come! And if you can't adopt, maybe you can foster or volunteer, and you can always donate!",

            "description": "DUFFY is a sweet playful senior who is great with cats and other dogs. He has been taken care of very well and had regular vet visits and nail trims. His elderly guardian died in her sleep. His family consists of another small Jack Russel mix that he is quite fond of Hattie - they are a bonded pair and must adopt together;  a medium sized dog (Moki) and two cats (Panda is seen together with Duffy often, they are fond of each other). We are looking for a family that will love them and continue their excellent veterinary care. Duffy is 10 yrs old, neutered, microchipped and vaccinated. Hattie is 11 yrs old, spayed, vaccinated, microchipped. They're currently eating Marty's Meals.\n\nWe have specific adoption and Covid rules listed below.\n\nRevised adoption policy\nDue to Covid -19 pandemic and social distancing requirements, we've revised our adoption policy. \n\nFirst, please email (desertpawsnm@gmail.com) to inquire before you fill out the online application to see if the pet is still available. (Please do not call or text). We'll send you a link to the application.\n\nWe are unable to do multi-dog/cat meetgreets or adoption events at this time or bring multiple animals to your house to choose from, so please only inquire if you're serious about adopting this particular animal. If you're just shopping around with several shelters and rescues, please let us know this. \n\nIf your application is approved (which \"could\" take up to one week) then we will contact you to set up a Zoom chat or ph call to answer questions/clarify anything and set up a day/time to bring the pet to you. \n\nSince we can't come into the home/yard due to Covid-19, we ask that you send us pics /video of your home/yard/living area/current pets. \n\nWe will discuss with you about meeting your other pets. At the meeting/adoption at your house (outside) please wear a mask (as will we), keep to a properly distanced social distance and have hand sanitizer and your own leash.\n\nWe adopt locally to Central Abq, Santa Fe, Los Alamos and Rio Rancho. No out of area adoptions inquiries please. \n\nThe animals are fostered and our foster families like to know their fosters are happy, healthy, and cared for during their lifetime. We appreciate staying in touch periodically (just a pic, holiday card, social media, pics/videos  etc will make our work worthwhile :-))\n\nOur volunteers and adoption board are working diligently with an overload of inquiries since Covid to match families and forever pets. Our workload on the reservations has also increased. We're sorry, but if you email us with questions that are already answered here or fill out an application that does not fit the parameters of our procedures we will not be replying to you. Thank you for your understanding on this!\n\nThank you - we look forward to hearing from you and having another furbaby united with a furever family!",

            "description": "Howdy I'm Elizabeth!!!\n\nI'm a sweet little girl that loves to cuddle all while playing and doing all those puppy things. I was saved from an overcrowded shelter along with all my brothers and sisters. I currently love playing with my bigger foster sister while exploring all the amazing things this world brings (especially all the tree branches ?) \n\nI was born dec. 21 and working on my puppy manners, foster mommy says I learn very quickly. Right now I am about 5lbs and expected to be medium to large size full grown given my mix breed. I love kids and other dogs, I've seen cats and they don't bother me (I even have a squirrel friend ). Lastly foster mommy is working on Kennel training with me and its going very well I think I'll be a pro very soon ?.\n\nOverall I'm a spunky, lovable girl that has lots of love to give I can't wait to join your family to start making all those great memories... are you excited to meet me?? Hurry and apply I can't wait to meet my forever family!\n\nPlease note: as with most rescue puppies, we have no way to guarantee this puppy\u2019s breed or size potential. \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for puppies covers initial deworming,  puppy vaccinations, microchip, and spay/neuter at the rescue's approved vet at 6 months of age. Please see our website for more information.\n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq\n\n*Any breed labels used by Take Paws Rescue, its employees/volunteers, or on vet records provided cannot be guaranteed.  Breed labels are given based on information obtained during intake and/or best guesses based on appearance and/or temperament of the dogs and Take Paws Rescue gives no assurance to the accuracy of these labels. Labels are necessary for postings to many animal networking sites, such as Pet Finder, and are no way a guarantee. Additionally, exact age and potential size cannot be guaranteed.",

            "description": "HATTIE is a sweet senior who is great with cats and other dogs. She has been taken care of very well and had regular vet visits and monthly acupuncture visits as well. Her elderly guardian died in her sleep. Her family consists of another small Jack Russel mix (Duffy) that she is quite fond of (they are a bonded pair and must adopt together), a medium sized dog (Moki) and four cats. We are looking for a family that will love Hattie and Duffy and continue their excellent veterinary care. Hattie is on a medication and Chinese herbs due to a mitral valve and cataracts. She is 11 yrs old, spayed, microchipped and vaccinated. Duffy is a playful 10 yr old, vaccinated, neutered, and microchipped. They are currently eating Marty's Meals.\n\nWe have specific adoption and Covid rules listed below.\n\nRevised adoption policy\nDue to Covid -19 pandemic and social distancing requirements, we've revised our adoption policy. \n\nFirst, please email (desertpawsnm@gmail.com) to inquire before you fill out the online application to see if the pet is still available. (Please do not call or text). We'll send you a link to the application.\n\nWe are unable to do multi-dog/cat meetgreets or adoption events at this time or bring multiple animals to your house to choose from, so please only inquire if you're serious about adopting this particular animal. If you're just shopping around with several shelters and rescues, please let us know this. \n\nIf your application is approved (which \"could\" take up to one week) then we will contact you to set up a Zoom chat or ph call to answer questions/clarify anything and set up a day/time to bring the pet to you. \n\nSince we can't come into the home/yard due to Covid-19, we ask that you send us pics /video of your home/yard/living area/current pets. \n\nWe will discuss with you about meeting your other pets. At the meeting/adoption at your house (outside) please wear a mask (as will we), keep to a properly distanced social distance and have hand sanitizer and your own leash.\n\nWe adopt locally to Central Abq, Santa Fe, Los Alamos and Rio Rancho. No out of area adoptions inquiries please. \n\nThe animals are fostered and our foster families like to know their fosters are happy, healthy, and cared for during their lifetime. We appreciate staying in touch periodically (just a pic, holiday card, social media, pics/videos  etc will make our work worthwhile :-))\n\nOur volunteers and adoption board are working diligently with an overload of inquiries since Covid to match families and forever pets. Our workload on the reservations has also increased. We're sorry, but if you email us with questions that are already answered here or fill out an application that does not fit the parameters of our procedures we will not be replying to you. Thank you for your understanding on this!\n\nThank you - we look forward to hearing from you and having another furbaby united with a furever family!\n",

I also get so excited that I jump and get all 4 paws off the ground! I am getting so good at using the potty outside and with sleeping in my crate. I have the cutest little legs and my ears are getting stronger every day--my foster parents think they'll start standing up all the time pretty soon! I can't wait to meet my forever family. \n\nDolly is a female Dachshund/Beagle Mix with estimated DOB of 11/10/20 and currently weighs 10 lbs as of 1/19/21.",

Just arrived but sweetness itself so please apply and show this puppy some snowy love.\n\nFacebook: Zani's Furry Friends ZFF (weekly adoption event info posted there)\nTwitter: zanisff \nInstagram: zanisfurryfriends\n \nDogs are spayed/neutered, UTD on age appropriate vaccines, Rabies vaxed, and microchipped (not Lyme vaxed but we seriously recommend it!)  All are in the NY/NJ area but we will adopt out of state to the purrfect home and in some cases, we can arrange transport.  Please go to our site zanisfurryfriends.org  and fill out an application \n\nMany of us (cats/dogs) will be on display on Saturdays or Sundays, weather dependent--please ask by writing us at info@zanisfurryfriends.org and following us on FB. If you are seriously interested in adopting one of us in particular, please fill out an application early Friday so that we can be sure to be there. Otherwise we decide based on other variables. Usually we are in our foster homes so this is a bit more stressful and a slightly artificial environment but we do want to be seen and find our furever homes too.\n \nPlease consider providing a home for more than one dog, especially if you are considering adopting a puppy. Dogs are pack animals and very much enjoy as well as need other dog company to learn to play, socialize and be good companion animals to people. The upside to this is that you won't feel as guilty leaving them alone and you get twice the love. Please come! And if you can't adopt, maybe you can foster or volunteer, and you can always donate!",

            "description": "*PLEASE NOTE: JAKE WILL NEED A FOREVER HOME WITH A YARD*\n\nJake is a 7 month old neutered male Decker Rat Terrier who weighs 24 lbs. Jake came to All 4 Paws after his owner could no longer provide him the care he needed due to health problems. This active boy is looking for an equally active family. He loves to play, be outside, and explore. Due to his activity level Jake is looking for a home with a yard in which he can stretch his legs. Jake is super smart and knows how to ring bells when he has to go outside. He seems to be house broken, is good in a crate, and listens well, but still needs a little work on leash. Jake would do best in a home without young kids as he does get excited and jump up still. He's been great with other dogs in play groups and loves playing with his doggie pals. He'll need a home without cats though. This adorable little guy is affectionate and cannot wait to find the devoted forever family he deserves - could it be yours??\n\nInterested in adopting?

She's a big red dog in a little package and loves everyone.  Please apply if you want your very own Valentine.\n\nFacebook: Zani's Furry Friends ZFF (weekly adoption event info posted there)\nTwitter: zanisff \nInstagram: zanisfurryfriends\n \nDogs are spayed/neutered, UTD on age appropriate vaccines, Rabies vaxed, and microchipped (not Lyme vaxed but we seriously recommend it!)  All are in the NY/NJ area but we will adopt out of state to the purrfect home and in some cases, we can arrange transport.  Please go to our site zanisfurryfriends.org  and fill out an application \n\nMany of us (cats/dogs) will be on display on Saturdays or Sundays, weather dependent--please ask by writing us at info@zanisfurryfriends.org and following us on FB. If you are seriously interested in adopting one of us in particular, please fill out an application early Friday so that we can be sure to be there. Otherwise we decide based on other variables. Usually we are in our foster homes so this is a bit more stressful and a slightly artificial environment but we do want to be seen and find our furever homes too.\n \nPlease consider providing a home for more than one dog, especially if you are considering adopting a puppy. Dogs are pack animals and very much enjoy as well as need other dog company to learn to play, socialize and be good companion animals to people. The upside to this is that you won't feel as guilty leaving them alone and you get twice the love. Please come! And if you can't adopt, maybe you can foster or volunteer, and you can always donate!",

I'm a black lab mix and my foster mom says I'm the cutest and sweetest.   \n\nI get along great with kids, cats,  and especially other dogs. I even like to go to my foster parents barn and hang out with the horses and cows. I relaxed and chill around people but don't demand a lot of attention. I just want to be in the room with you. Foster mom says my personality really comes out around my dog friends and I'd love a furrever home that has a friend for me.  \n\nI just learned to walk on a leash and am fully potty trained. I'm also crate trained but sometimes need a treat bribery to go in. I ride well in a vehicle and enjoy going to the office everyday with my foster daddy. I do have one naughty habit I haven't gotten rid of,  I do enjoy counter surfing for snacks and investigating the trash in detail.  \n\nI had heartworm but have been fully treated and am scheduled to be neutered soon. Do you want to be my furrever home? I can't wait to meet you!!\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq\n\n*Any breed labels used by Take Paws Rescue, its employees/volunteers, or on vet records provided cannot be guaranteed.  Breed labels are given based on information obtained during intake and/or best guesses based on appearance and/or temperament of the dogs and Take Paws Rescue gives no assurance to the accuracy of these labels. Labels are necessary for postings to many animal networking sites, such as Pet Finder, and are no way a guarantee. Additionally, exact age and potential size cannot be guaranteed.",

Bye-bye Clovis New Mexico hello Colorado. My name is Chloe and I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re my forever. I\u2019m about five months old, 24 lbs and possibly a Dalmatian mix. I\u2019m amazingly well adjusted and outgoing for my scary beginnings. I\u2019m curious on my walks and want to say hello to all those new people and pups. I love to play with the dogs in my foster home and would do best with another playful companion that doesn\u2019t get annoyed if I occasionally don\u2019t take their cues that they\u2019re done. I\u2019m pretty energetic so a yard and a good amount of exercise are recommended. I am good at playing with toys on my own and love snuggling; I\u2019m a well rounded girl. After a little bit of protesting I sleep nicely in my crate all night. I\u2019m very close to housebroken; it\u2019s just a new house I\u2019m a little confused. I pretty much love everybody; since I still have a bit of that puppy mouthing and razor blade teeth really young children probably wouldn\u2019t be a great idea. Well enough about me what about you? Would you want to wake up every day with a pup who is a true joy to be around? I promise I\u2019ll make you smile and be a really good girl if you are the right home for me. Apply at FromforgottenToforever.com I will be available for adoption on Feb 5th but we could meet before to see if it is the right fit. Love Chloe.\nhttps://www.fromforgottentoforever.com/adoptionapplication/",

He is also accustomed to regular brushings and nail trims. His elderly guardian died in her sleep. His fur family consists of two smaller dogs (Hattie and Duffy) and two cats (Panda). We are looking for a family that will love him and continue his excellent veterinary care. He is on a medication - Thyrosin. He is 11 yrs old, neutered, microchipped and vaccinated.\n\nWe have specific adoption and Covid rules listed below.\n\nRevised adoption policy\nDue to Covid -19 pandemic and social distancing requirements, we've revised our adoption policy. \n\nFirst, please email (desertpawsnm@gmail.com) to inquire before you fill out the online application to see if the pet is still available. (Please do not call or text). We'll send you a link to the application.\n\nWe are unable to do multi-dog/cat meetgreets or adoption events at this time or bring multiple animals to your house to choose from, so please only inquire if you're serious about adopting this particular animal. If you're just shopping around with several shelters and rescues, please let us know this. \n\nIf your application is approved (which \"could\" take up to one week) then we will contact you to set up a Zoom chat or ph call to answer questions/clarify anything and set up a day/time to bring the pet to you. \n\nSince we can't come into the home/yard due to Covid-19, we ask that you send us pics /video of your home/yard/living area/current pets. \n\nWe will discuss with you about meeting your other pets. At the meeting/adoption at your house (outside) please wear a mask (as will we), keep to a properly distanced social distance and have hand sanitizer and your own leash.\n\nWe adopt locally to Central Abq, Santa Fe, Los Alamos and Rio Rancho. No out of area adoptions inquiries please. \n\nThe animals are fostered and our foster families like to know their fosters are happy, healthy, and cared for during their lifetime. We appreciate staying in touch periodically (just a pic, holiday card, social media, pics/videos  etc will make our work worthwhile :-))\n\nOur volunteers and adoption board are working diligently with an overload of inquiries since Covid to match families and forever pets. Our workload on the reservations has also increased. We're sorry, but if you email us with questions that are already answered here or fill out an application that does not fit the parameters of our procedures we will not be replying to you. Thank you for your understanding on this!\n\nThank you - we look forward to hearing from you and having another furbaby united with a furever family!",

He likes to be held and kissed, enjoys cuddling and sitting by your side to watch TV.\n\nHe is potty trained and goes on an area that has artificial turf. Sleeps in a crate, but roams the house freely during the day and has access to a patio/yard.\n\nHe can be a little timid at first but warms up very fast. He is a sweet and intelligent.\n\nHe has never lived with kids. A family with a calm and loving environment will be best for Terry.\n\nIf interested please submit your application at www.drwb.org",

They each weigh 12 lbs and originally came from a home where they were left outside with very little human interaction and were very shy and scared. They were then adopted by a lovely older couple who potty trained them and gave them lots of loving and attention. But very sad to say they are now dealing with a terminal illness and had to return the pups. \nIvy is the white one, very friendly, loving, sweet and has tons of energy!\nHer sister Olive is the shy black one. She is afraid of strangers and will shriek, growl or pee on herself if scared.  You just have to ignore her and approach slowly and she will be fine and loving and sweet like her sister! \nThe girls play with each other non stop! Very bonded pair and must be adopted together.\n\n\nAdoption fee includes spaying/neutering, shots, micro-chip and deworming.\nPlease contact foster parent Dinesha at 972-896-6313 or email adbadoptions@yahoo.com. To see dogs, please download an application from our website, www.adifferentbreed.org and email it to foster parents address above. We will arrange a meet and greet.",

Chicken & Macaroni, Chillin\u2019 with my Homies! \n\nThese 2 month old lab chihuahua mixes are ready to move on from their life of fame and settle into a forever home! These guys weigh between 3-8 lbs and will be small dogs when fully grown. They have typical puppy energy, enjoying wrestling matches with each other and chewing on bones, before settling in for a nap. Chillin & Homie are the smallest of the litter. They\u2019re sweet pups who are ready for their forever family! Their adoption fee is $400.00.\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

And here is a list of things I NEED: LOTS of walks, which means leash training, LOTS of toys, so I can chew my own stuff, LOTS of socializing with people and other animals, that way we can both have lots of friends, LOTS of training, which requires LOTS of patience, but pays off when you realize it makes me so much easier to live with and last but not least, LOTS of Love.   Yeah, I admit it, I'm a lot of work at first, but trust me, we'll both find it to be worth the effort.  Only those who can handle all of the above and intend to keep me with them no matter what life may bring need apply.  \n\nAnimals in our program are housed in Foster homes. Please contact us @ 208-232-0371, leave a message and a Volunteer will get back with you as soon as possible, with the Foster Parent's contact information.\n\nVisit with this animal and our other fosters during our Adoption day, the second Saturday of each month @ our building, located @ 850 Barton Rd., Pocatello, ID 83204",

Chicken & Macaroni, Chillin\u2019 with my Homies! \n\nThese 2 month old lab chihuahua mixes are ready to move on from their life of fame and settle into a forever home! These guys weigh between 3-8 lbs and will be small dogs when fully grown. They have typical puppy energy, enjoying wrestling matches with each other and chewing on bones, before settling in for a nap. Chillin & Homie are the smallest of the litter. They\u2019re sweet pups who are ready for their forever family! Their adoption fee is $400.00.\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

Astra can be a little nervous of new situations, but she is slowly coming out of her shell in her foster home. Astra is going to be a large dog.  She enjoys the company of other dogs and would do well in a home with another confident dog to help her feel more at ease. \n\nIf you are interested in Astra, please complete our adoption application by accessing the following link: https://fs29.formsite.com/RDR1/AdoptionApp/index.html\n\nIf you have any questions about Astra, please email carol@realdogrescue.org. Please keep in mind that Real Dog Rescue is run solely by volunteers. We aim to process applications and respond to emails as quickly as possible, and we appreciate your patience.  Thank you.",
