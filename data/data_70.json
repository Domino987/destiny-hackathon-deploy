She loves to run and play with toys as well as other dogs and likes everyone she meets. Buffy is also house trained! She was surrendered to us because the owner couldn't give her the care she needed and would jump his small chain link fence and go to the neighbor's for attention. She would be good with other dogs, kids, and cats. If you would like more information, please contact SCHS at 870-269-5200 or visit her at our shelter at 17379 Highway 9, Mountain View, Arkansas. You can also go on-line and complete an adoption application at schspets.org. UPDATE: Buffy just entered the Paws in Prison Program in Calico Rock for 8 weeks of training. She will receive obedience training, house trained, crate trained and learn tricks too. She will graduate mid February.",

He has two different colored eyes... very rare!)\nGlitzen was transferred from Glynn County Animal Control. He is beautiful, isn't he? We think he looks kind of looks like a little reindeer, too. Glitzen also has beautiful eyes that seem to look right through you. Different colors, which makes me think of the old saying \"one eye on earth and the other on heaven\". They are definitely intriguing. He also has some amazing ears! Glitzen has lots of energy, so will definitely do best with an active family with time to play and redirect all that energy in a positive direction. He does not appear to have had a lot of training at only 11 months of age. However, he is also old enough to pick it up right away. Glitzen is just a really loveable guy who is looking for a really loveable family...for life. He is neutered, microchipped, current on core vaccines and has tested negative for heartworms. Email humanesociety@hsscg.org for an application for Glitzen. You will fall in love with his amazing looks, personality and energy.",

My name is Snow but it really can be changed to something else any time!!\n\nI am a young girl..appx 1 1/2 years old and weight just 25lbs. I was taken from a situation where I was not cared for and not paid much attention to and while I am so much better than when I came to my foster home I still get scared easily. I am timid at first but I get over that pretty quickly. My foster mom says I am the biggest cuddle bug ever. Did I mention my awesome eyes? I need another dog in my new home that is close to my size because bigger playful dogs still make me feel insecure but I do love to play. I walk great on a leash and going for walks is the best. I am crate trained and getting the hang of pottying outside but I need to be kept on a schedule for that. So what do you think? Am I the god for you??\n\nIf you would like to meet Snow send us an email to theloveofk9s@yahoo.com and we will get back with you as quick as we can.\n\nAdoption donation pays for all vetting....my spay, a heart worm test, all vaccinations, deworming, flea prevention, a microchip and a wellness exam",

He has now been vetted and neutered and is ready to find a home that will love him for the rest of his days. \n\nHe is described as a sweetie who does well with people and other dogs. He has not spent significant time with kids or cats.\n\nAs he is a hound, he needs a fully-fenced secure yard and would not be well-suited for a home that shares walls with neighbors!\n \n\nOur adoption fee includes age appropriate vaccinations, deworming, microchipping and transport expenses. Adoption fee is $450 to help offset travel and medical expenses.\n\nAll children at home should be at least age 5 to be approved for adoption!\n\nApplications can be made at bigdogrescueproject.org/adopt",

            "description": "$125 of adoption fee sponsoredMeet Tanner!\n\nAre you looking for a little extra sunshine in your life? Someone who is always in a good mood? Tanner knows just what kind of smile it takes to help you stay paw-sitive.\n\nThis September 12th marks the fact that Tanner will be with Partners for 2 years. That's 730 days without a home of his own... and he STILL manages to stay this smiley?? What a dog.\n\nTanner is 8 years old, but he's not ready to slow down just yet! He has a zest for life and is so eager to please his people. He needs to be an only pet, but he loves with all of his might. No small children, please. Won't you give him a chance to win your heart over?\n\nTanner's adoption fee is $195, but thanks to a generous donor, Tanner's adoption fee is now only $70! He is neutered, microchipped and current on all vaccines.\n\nApply for Tanner online today! Adoption applications are available online at\nwww.partnersforpetsil.org/applications\n\nIf you are interested in adopting please go to our website at www.partnersforpetsil.org and fill out an online application.\n\nAdoptions are held at the O'Fallon, IL PetSmart every Saturday of the month from 11am-3:30pm and at the Glen Carbon, IL PetSmart every Sunday from 11am-3:30pm. We are also at Petco in Edwardsville Crossing on Sundays from 11:30-3:30 pm. The cats are only at Glen Carbon Petsmart. Please let us know if you are interested in a pet and we can arrange to have them meet you at one of the adoption events.",

She was rescued from a county Animal Control shelter, and it's clear she was a former breeder dog. Furkids is helping her find a home where she can live a wonderful puppy-free life! She would do best in an adult-only home without other animals. If that's your home, please consider adopting Jingle Bells. She is currently undergoing treatments for heartworm disease. Until she has completed her treatments and is fully recovered, she is available for adoption only in the Atlanta area. She must be able to come to Furkids' shelter for treatments. Jingle Bells weighs 54 lbs., her estimated birth date is 12/17/2015 and her adoption fee is $275. If you want more information about Jingle Bells, please submit a survey at https://furkids.org/dog-adoptions/application. At this time, meeting our dogs is by appointment only. After submitting a survey, an adoption counselor will contact you to give you more information about the dog you are interested in adopting and to arrange for you to meet the dog. Must be at least 21 years of age to adopt.",

I was saved from a not so great situation by a nice lady but she couldn't keep me. I am currently in a foster home waiting for a home of my own. I am about 8 years old and weigh appx  30lbs. I am a couch potato but I do like to go for walks and car rides. I am a great companion that thinks being with my people is the most fun. I would do best as an only dog but I do like cats and kids that are a little older. \n\nIf you would like to meet Minnie send us an email to theloveofk9s@yahoo.com and we will get back with you as quick as we can.\n\nAdoption donation pays for all vetting...Spay, all vaccinations, a heart worm test, deworming, flea prevention, a dental, a microchip and a wellness exam.",

He is so handsome, has a squishy face for kissing, loves to give hugs as much as he likes getting them, loves playing with other dogs and going to daycare! He would be a great running partner with some training or a walking/hiking buddy.\n\nRowdy would love to find an active person or family, are you the one?\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Rowdy please submit an inquiry directly with Greater Charlotte SPCA by visiting charlottespca.org/adopt.\n\n***Because our rescue is composed entirely of volunteers and we require a home check for each of our adoptable pets prior to them going to their new homes, local applications will take precedence. We will accept out of town applications, but any family further than 60 miles from Charlotte is responsible for finding a representative of a rescue local to them that is willing to perform the home check. All out of town applicants will also have to be willing to drive to Charlotte to meet/pick up the pet as soon as the application is approved.***",

            "description": "In memory of Josephine Catanese\nGrandma Great's Special Transport\n\nA transport in memory of Josephine Catanese, better known as Gram. A special mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, sister, aunt, cousin, and friend. Gram's life centered around her family. She loved us, listened to us, taught us, encouraged us, advised us, and was always there for us. Gram had many pets through the years from fish and birds to cats and dogs. Most of which were acquired by her family and brought to her home where they stayed and never looked back. All of these animals weren't just animals, they became a part of her family. She even cared for the stray cats in her neighborhood, making a cat house with heating pads, plenty of canned and dry food, water, and medicine if needed. She exemplified love and kindness every day of her life. This transport in honor of our Gram is a continuation of her love and kindness of all animals.\n\nPlease read EVERYTHING below if you are interested in this dog! We are getting so many applications for Ivy and we love this girl and she is a blast to live with, but she is not for everyone. We've received applications for her from humans that work full time and there is no other dog and another where the humans wanted a dog to alert them if someone comes to the door.....Please read as we want Ivy happy and we want you happy.\n\nIvy was born around October 15, 2019, and weighs about 17 pounds. Ivy came in with 6 puppies that were only days old. Ivy was an incredibly attentive mother and her pups are now grown. It's Ivy's turn to live the pampered life! Ivy is ADORABLE! She loves to cuddle in the evening when the day is done, but during the day she is playing with the other dogs, running, racing, having a ball and she is very agile! We found her balancing on the bottom rungs of the kitchen stool the other day - just for fun. Ivy is leash trained and loves her daily walks, she's so curious about everything outside! She makes us laugh every day! Ivy is good with other dogs and with kids and rides well in the car. Ivy was introduced to a cat the other day and she didn't pay any attention to it. She also loves to snuggle!\nUPDATE FROM FOSTER MOM: Ivy is very affectionate - she loves people very quickly. She is very happy to cuddle up with you at night in your favorite spot. She would like someone that is home most of the time. Ivy is deaf - you can vacuum right next to her and she doesn't move. She will lay in a dog bed in whatever room you are in. She does not do well in a crate, while you are not home. She does do well in a crate in the car though. She is a climber and very clever. A home with a lot of fine antiques would not be the best fit for her. And it's not unusual for us to find her on the kitchen counter or table or jumping in your micro-green planter. We know that she enjoys quiche and if that is gone the golumpki is fair game - you will not be able to leave food unattended. And she adores helping you with your paperwork whether it's shuffling paper or knocking your laptop on the floor. She would like a spot where she can look out the window - maybe she is part cat?? A wood fenced yard would be good for her because we are pretty sure she can climb a chain link.\n\nThe Adoption Fee for this dog is $500.00\nAdoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a 'complete' pet. We accept CASH or Visa/Mastercard ONLY.\n\nJoyful Rescues has no funding except for our adoption fees and miscellaneous donations. Pet care and vet bills are expensive - you must be ready to take on this financial (as well as emotional) responsibility. YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 25 YEARS OF AGE TO ADOPT A DOG FROM JOYFUL RESCUES\n\nWe keep our pet list as up-to-date as possible. As soon as a pet is adopted, it is removed from the list. If a pet is still showing, it is still available for adoption.\n\nCan't Adopt Me? SPONSOR ME\nLook for the Link 'Special Instructions to Seller' if you want to note a particular pet\nBefore you seek to adopt a pet from Joyful Rescues, please read our Pet Adoption page http://www.joyfulrescues.org/pet_adoption.html.\n\nOnline Application",

            "description": "Name: Ludo\nAge: 3 Years 8 Months (approx)\nBreed: Mixed Breed\nAdoption Fee: $275.00\n\nLudo is a a very happy-go-lucky boy who came to the shelter because his owner was moving and not able to take him. Ludo is a silly pup and wins the gold medal for biggest goofball! He gets sooooo excited when it's his turn for walks and playtime. His chunky butt wiggles in delight and he's always smiling! He bounds through the fields with his nose to the ground searching for whatever little creatures are lurking below! Ludo does enjoy playing with toys and also loves a good belly rub!\n\nLudo knows his basic commands, is housebroken, neutered and current on vaccinations. Ludo currently weighs 85 pounds and hopes his new adopter will help him continue his weight loss journey to live his best life. \n\nLudo really loves the company of ladies and can be fearful of men. With patience and reassurance, he has been learning there are nice men in this world and has shown more trust when allowed the time he needs. Ludo's ideal home will be a home where he is the only pet. Children should be 14+ and he will do best in a low foot traffic area. He's hunk of chunk you will fall in love with! \n\nWe kindly ask, IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS regarding Ludo PLEASE EMAIL:\n\n adoption@popememorialcvhs.org\n\n\n*********************************************\n\nHow To Adopt a Pet\n\nWe are currently offering adoptions by appointment only, due to the Coronavirus. The Adoption Center remains closed to drop-in visitors.\n\nThe process to schedule an appointment begins with the submission of an application, which can be found on our website. Once the application is approved, we will reach out to you to schedule an appointment. Please bear with us, the new process has slowed our response time.\n\nIf you do not see an animal that would fit into your home, we highly recommend checking our website weekly as new animals may become available. We do not offer a waitlist for specific breeds, types, etc. \n\nAs always, adoptions are first come, first serve, meaning the applicant who is approved first gets their choice of available appointment times and thus his/her choice of animals to meet and adopt. We are not able to extend holds on any animals at this time, so we ask interested adopters to make their adoption decision during their appointment and be prepared to take their new pet home with you.\n\nThe easiest way to communicate with us with any questions is via email to: \n\nadoption@popememorialcvhs.org\n\n\nNo phone calls please - Submit an application here ----> \n\nhttps://popememorialcvhs.org/adoption-application\n Primary Color: Red Secondary Color: White Weight: 85.1lbs Age: 3yrs 9mths 0wks Animal has been Neutered",

We honestly do not know and are only guessing! He is approx 2 years old and around 40 lbs.\n\nReggie is friendly with other dogs, good with kids, but not a fan of cats. He's playful and also\n\na bit of a ham! If allowed, he'll gently jump up to put his paws on your waist so you can more easily cradle him. He's always curious to know what's going on in the kitchen. Though constantly hoping for a snack, he is polite around food. He stands back while his food is served and only dives in after server has stepped aside. He learned to sit within the first week in foster home.\n\nReggie\n\nlikes to play with other dogs. He's still working on leash training, and learning not to pull or weave side to side. Reggie always interested in other people and pets walking and does barks when he sees them. He has lots of puppy energy, can jump straight up off the ground and likes to chew things he finds laying around. Reggie doesn't jump up on furniture, though if invited to sit on your lap he would! Reggie is a sweet boy and is looking for a family to give some snuggles to!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out the form below:\n\nredemptionroadrescue.rescuegroups.org/forms\n\nAdoption fee: $485.00\n\nredemptionroad.mn@gmail.com\n\nhttp://redemptionroadrescue.rescuegroups.org\n\nAll dogs age appropriate vetted:\n\nSpayed or Neutered\nRabies vaccine\nDHPP vaccine\n4DX test (@8 months or older)\nMicrochipped\nDewormed\nFlea/tick prevention",

Dog knows sit command and will sit for treats. He takes the treats gentley. Likes playing fetch. Dog even goes back to kennel without issue. JS 01/10/21 10:56 high energy not kenneling well , too stressed. Good boy taken out to play yard did well. sms 01/11/21 08:13 Update: 01/07/21 12:02 Starting to show signs of kennel stress. Pupils dilated, jumping on kennel, barking and pacing. Dog is still acting friendly, but it is evident dog is becoming stressed in this environment. ddp 12/30/20 13:11 Took out to play yard. Leashes easily and walked well on leash. Only stopped to smell other dogs as we passed by other kennels, no aggression. Dog was playful once outside. Plays catch and know the sit command. Dog was slighlty possesive over toys he would let them go if i used a stern voice. Adopters should be prepared to provide some training. JS Update: 12/11/20 Moved to GP from healthy intake. Dog leashed easily but is very strong and pulled on leash. He was friendly and allowed handling. He also kenneled well. JS 12/10/20 14:25 very high energy, RP states he did well with her feamle dog and her kids, he not not do well with her male dog or cats. OK during impound",

If there\u2019s water I am there!  I also love to snuggle with my human family and show them I am devoted.\n\nI am about 55 pds, crate trained and know the doggie door but I am still learning my manners on the leash!\n\nI play well with kids, as well as submissive canine females.  I would do best as a single dog or with a submissive female!  I do like to play so I will need a lot of exercise to tire me out.   If all this sounds good, I would be the best dog for you!\n\nWant to play?  ***Please contact spwheels1@gmail.com for an adoption application.\n",

Nyla is an approximately 2-year-old, spayed female, weighing 35-40 lbs. \n\nNyNy came into the RAD Rescue family on September 26, 2020 after being trapped. \n\nSince being in foster we have learned a lot about Nyla. She is housebroken, crate trained, walks well on a leash, and seems to prefer smaller dogs although she has warmed up to larger dogs when given time. \n\nNyNy has been around goats and stayed away. She showed slight curiosity for the tortoises but decided they weren\u2019t worth her time. She met a cat a couple of times, both times she wanted to get away from the cat as quickly as possible. \n\nNyla is shy when meeting new people but once she warms up to you she is very loving and will even play with you. She bounces around when happy and playful with her ears bouncing too earning her the nickname Jellybean. \n\nJellybean doesn\u2019t appreciate being left home alone but she tolerates it, maybe tearing up her blanket to show you her displeasure. She would much prefer someone who she could hang out with during the day. \n\nAll in all, Nyla is a really sweet pup who would love a doggy friend to play with in her forever home but she may do just fine without one. She would likely do best with no young kids as certain sudden movements (like grabbing her collar) can freak her out. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting Nyla please submit an application with RAD Rescue Inc.",

            "description": "Diamond is an Irish Terrier mix, she is around 6 years old. She is approximately 45 lbs.\n\nDiamond is a sassy little doe-eyed girl, weighing about 35 lbs. She is a terrier mix and has medium length hair.\n\nDiamond will need a person in her life who can understand her. She is very sweet and enjoys cuddling and curling up on the couch with you for movie night. She knows a few cues (sit, wait, kennel, comes when called) and is generally very well behaved. She does not chew on inappropriate items. Diamond is perfectly potty trained and is also crate trained. She walks pretty well on a leash, too.\n\nHowever, Diamond lacks confidence and therefore can be very shy when meeting new people. She can be defensive of her body when she is unsure, so she does need time to learn to trust her humans before they try to interact with her physically too much. She is food motivated, so that is one good way to help build a bond with her. She just needs her new person to take things very slowly with her so that she can learn to trust them on her own schedule. Once she trusts you, she will be your cuddle buddy forever.\n\nFor that reason, Diamond would do best in a home that doesn't have a lot of traffic, visitors (or she should have a safe place to hang out while visitors are over) or young children. She tends to get nervous when there is a lot of comotion or if she is uncertain about things.\n\nDiamond does like other dogs, but she can be a bit resource-guardy with her food, toys, and even her person. She would thrive in a place where she has boundaries about what space is hers and what is not, and where she can eat her meals away from other dogs. She would need to live with dogs who can respect her cues about her space. Her person will need to help guide Diamond as to appropriate responses to other dogs sharing her space.\n\nDiamond enjoys going in the car. She may get a little anxious, but she is getting better about this.\n\nOverall this pretty gem just needs someone who can meet her halfway with her wants and needs, love her but still lovingly guide her when she needs it. Her adorable single floppy ear and her deep, soulful eyes will capture your heart in no time.\n\nAlso, I made her an FB album that anyone can view. That is here: https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10225067257659353&type=3\n\nDiamond is on anti anxiety medication that would run around $20/month.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Diamond, please complete an online application at https://hopeanimalrescueofiowa.duplie.com/forms/196/dog-application\n\nAdoption fee is $250 which includes spay/neuter, microchip, and age appropriate vaccines.",

I love chewing on bones, bully sticks and all of my chew toys.  I love running, and boy can I jump! My humans and I love to play catch and tug-of-war with some of my favorite rope toys.  Walks with my humans are my absolute FAVORITE thing to do.  Speaking of my humans, unfortunately, I need to find a new home because the small humans have recently been diagnosed with pretty severe allergies to dogs. They have tried everything to be able to keep me but it just has been enough.  But that's ok, because I have A LOT of love to give my next family.  I I love laying on my humans' laps and getting lots of ear scratches and belly rubs.  I don't get along with other big dogs, they scare me.  However, I do get along with little dogs really well, but I can play a little rough with them sometimes.  I am crate trained (I love my bed in my crate as well.) I love having lots of space to run and chase squirrels and birds.  My humans have done a great job of keeping up on my vet care.  I am neutered, micro-chipped and up-to-date on all of my vaccines.  I have even had regular heartworm tests (yes, they are negative.)  I hope I can find a good fun loving home and I can't wait to meet you.\n\nDue to the current events, the rescue is not able to host adoption events.

Even though Tyson is a good role model for other dogs, he is unsure of men at first and will need a slow introduction. Tyson is hopeful to have a forever family soon to snuggle up with at night. His heart is ready to love and be loved.\n\nTyson is between 5-7 years old. He does well with other dog friends too! \n\nTyson is up to date on shots and has been neutered.\n\nTyson's adoption fee is $210 - if you would like to meet him, please contact Karen at napr411@gmail.com. Thank you.\n\nWe are a small rescue and have a home visit as a part of our adoption process so we are only able to adopt in Ohio.",

They did note that she is very sweet though. She's very playful, but very strong. She's loving after she lets out some energy. She was good around the small children in the household, but hasn't lived with cats or other dogs. She likes toys and car rides, but she also likes to jump a lot. She loves fetch and playful chasing. She already knows the commands sit, and lay. She's very food motivated.",

For additional information about Cowboy, please contact WASA by calling 203 557 0361 or by sending an email to wasa1@optonline.net.  Potential adopters do need to complete an online application by visiting:  http://www.westportwasa.org/adopt/wasa-adoption-application/.  Once an application has been approved, a meet and greet will be scheduled.  A home visit, conducted in keeping with COVID restrictions, is part of the adoption process.  Adoption area is limited in regard to home visit.\n\nCowboy is a sweet and affectionate 6 to 7-year-old Dachshund that comes to the WASA foster program due to a change in living situation for his owner.  He does well meeting new people.  While he is living quite harmoniously with other dogs in his foster home, he can be feisty in regard to meeting strange dogs.  He is a busy man with places to go and people to see but does settle down nicely for lap time and cuddles.  Experience with the dachshund breed is preferred.",

Rye would love to cuddle in your bed. She's about 55 pounds. She hasn't been around cats or kids but we are pretty sure she would do just fine. She is very sweet and loving.\n\nIf you are interested, complete the\nAdoption Application\non our website at\nwww.NeedyPaws.org\nand we will contact you.\n\nAdopters must live within an hour's drive of St. Louis, MO.\n\nRye's adoption fee is $250.00, which includes up-to-date vaccinations, heartworm testing and preventative, spay/neuter and microchip.\n\nWe are a 100% foster-based rescue and all of our dogs live in approved foster homes.

Alley came to us covered in fleas and dirt, and severely underweight. One of her most important jobs in her foster home these days is to put on much needed weight. Even though life has not been kind to Alley, she did not hold a grudge against anyone, and is in fact, more than ready to share her love and affection with anyone who is willing to share a moment with her! She will absolutely melt in your arms if you want to spend some time giving her head scratches and gentle pets. Alley has such a wonderful temperament - she is always happy and ready to greet you with a big pyr hug :) Despite having limited exposure to living with people, Alley has wonderful house manners. Nonetheless, she is hoping that her furever family will help her with some more training so that she can become the pyrfect girl for them. This girl is hoping to have her very own furever family to cuddle with in time for the holidays. Will you open your heart and show Alley all the wonderful things there are in this world?\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nView full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed. \n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

            "description": "Senior Hearts Rescue and Renewal is the only licensed senior dog rescue organization in Western Pennsylvania. We do not have a shelter or a public facility. ALL of our dogs reside in foster homes in the greater Pittsburgh, PA area. \n\nWe are a 100% volunteer organization. Please respect our volunteers' time. If a dog is listed on PetFinder, he/she IS available for adoption. We cannot reply to messages, phone calls, and emails about a dog until we have received, reviewed, and approved an adoption application. \n\nOur ADOPTION application is found at www.seniorhearts.org Completing this application is the first step in our adoption screening process. You MUST complete the application in its entirety in order to be considered as a potential adopter.  Please select \"More About Us\" for further details on our adoption requirements.  You can meet a dog ONLY after we have completed our adoption approval process.\n\nIf you are looking at the dog below, it most certainly means the dog is available for adoption. We will not respond to questions asking if the the dog is available. \n\nWe look forward to receiving your application in hopes that you are able to meet our adoption requirements and provide this dog with a loving furever home.\n\nAnd now a little about super cute Bandit.\nI\u2019m 10 years young and weigh 13lbs. I\u2019m a most handsome little guy, aren\u2019t I?\n\nI\u2019m a shy guy, but once I get to know you, I might stick to you like Velcro. I\u2019m a good snuggler too. \n\nI enjoy long walks and playing with a dog sibling. I do require a dog sibling in my furever home. I\u2019m sure we can cause some good trouble together. After all of that, I like to get some good couch time in watching Netflix.\n\nI am a doxie. So if you don\u2019t like barking, then I\u2019m not the dog for you. Oh no kids in my furever home please. And no cats either, after all I am a doxie!\n\nI\u2019m a sweet, happy, sassy, snuggly guy with a ton of love to give. I can be adopted within a two-hour radius of Pittsburgh, PA. If you are interested in giving me a furever home, you must first complete the adoption application at www.seniorhearts.org",

            "description": "Morgan, 1 yr., neutered, Kelpie/Anatolian mixMORGAN! Approximately 1 and a few months year old. Looks like a chocolate and fawn Kelpie and Anatolian shepherd. His DNA test would be interesting to see!\nThe shelter had him listed as a \"she\", and there was a gender reveal once he allowed his tummy to touched!\nThis handsome guy and his sister, Marlo, have had quite the journey to get here. They were confiscated from a property with too many dogs, and had apparently just existed, zero socialization or handling. They were confiscated with some other dogs.\nThe leash was definitely a foreign experience for both. Shelters don't like this, so last call for these two, made it out on their final hour thanks to a village of people to provide transportation, vetting and boarding, eventually getting them here.\nI've been working hard with Morgan since July 2020! He walks beautifully on leash and comes to his name. I could probably let him off leash completely, but mostly I let a long line drag. He's not a heeler or a border collie. He's got more of the guardian working mentality, and he's independent!\nI can see his wheels turning when I call him to come to me. Weighing out the ROI, a little more freedom and a treat? Or me in a huff when I reel him in. He's figuring it out! Makes much more sense to stay with me and come when called.\nMorgan is an awesome dog. He's about 75 lbs, and just filling out into the dog he will be. He really is magnificent.\nHe's sweet and curious! He loves, I mean loves, my 90 lb male dog Romeo, he just loves the confidence in this older pack leader I think. He's very respectful of my older gals. Gentle and cautious with fragile 16 yr old Bonnie, and Tory is his home girl, gangster, even at 14, and she loves to play with Morgan. Morgan gets along with all the dogs, but has taken special liking to some, like cute little Willie.\nI've come to really love this boy and I'm so proud of his progress! As hard as this is, the goal always was to get Morgan a home of his own. It's time for him to transfer his allegiance to another pack.\nSo definitely another dog or 2 in his future. He seems to have some prey drive on the trail. But that doesn't preclude him from being introduced to a cat. He really is a very gentle giant.\nMorgan came here with exposure to nothing. So everything was new for him. His world is opening up for him a little at a time and he's up for it! I take him on neighborhood walks now as well as nature hikes. And he does great with his harness or on a collar.\nSo the needs and wants for Morgan are other dog/s, a large yard, and owners who are active and up for training a young, intelligent dog. And expanding his horizons.\nPhotos updated at:https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?vanity=cchdrescue.org&set=a.2625544704328259\nAdoption fee is $400 and includes sterilization surgery, vaccinations, flea & tick abatement, worming, transportation to us, microchipping + chip registration. Also covers care for all the dogs while in rescue.\nTo download an application to meet Morgan: http://cchdrescue.org/adoptionprocess.html or email: info@cchdrescue.org\nCentral Coast Herding Dog Rescue, is a Rescue Alliance partner, a federally recognized 501(c)3 non profit organization, dedicated to finding great dogs, great homes. County of San Luis Obispo Animal Service Operating Permit #C2649. Thank you for reading about Morgan, and thanks for considering rescue!",

I'm a playful and sweet guy who's looking for a special home. I'm a charming fella with good looks to match (if I do say so myself!) All the ladies love me and I like them in return. I get along with all dogs but if my forever home has another dog, it should ideally be lady or a very mellow fella. Whatever dog it is, they need to understand the concept of personal space. I'd also be perfectly happy to be an only dog. I will need a special home that understands I need to be able to do my own thing. I love people, but again, I am more of an introverted kind of guy. I'd really love a quiet home with an easy mellow atmosphere and just a few special people to adore. I am not suited to a a first time dog owner. I need someone with dog experience- no exceptions. I am not suited to a home with children under the age of 16. My ideal home would be a place where someone is around in the day as I really enjoy being with my people. I am incredibly good in the house. I am house trained, have great house manners, neutered, am up-to-date on vaccines and preventatives and I'm ready to find my forever home!\n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $350 which includes routine vetting and spay/neuter.\n\n***Please note that our first step is submitting an application (it does not commit you in any way but allows us to discuss with you if you and the dog are a good fit). In addition, an important step in approving adoption applicants is to complete a vet check. Vetting of current and past pets is very important to us, thus we will be speaking with the vet(s) listed on your application to ensure that your current and previous pet(s) are kept up to date on vaccines (including rabies), spayed or neutered, maintained on appropriate monthly preventatives and examined annually by your vet.***\n\nTo complete an online application, please click here and email Crystal at cwoodlovepaws@gmail.com\n\n**If you're viewing this on Petfinder, please visit www.lovepawspg.org to complete our non-binding application.**",

The sad thing is this is home and we are family. To this day he is still afraid of a leash and wants nothing to do with it. In a home, someone could dedicate more time to training than we have to give one animal. Joey loves children, but his energy may be a bit much for small children.

With temperatures dropping, she was more than happy to hitch a ride to PACC and get out of the cold and into the heat. Since arriving, she's been on her best behavior and is winning hearts all over the shelter. In play group, Navidad was nervous at first, but was tolerant of other dogs greeting her and was appropriate about asking for space. Navidad would do best in a home with a secure, fenced yard and a confident owner to help her overcome her shyness. If you've got some room in your home and heart this holiday season, make an appointment to meet sweet Navidad today.",

I love treats, will quickly sit for one & take it from you gently. I also love playing with squeaky toys,  exploring my surroundings and being around people. I don\u2019t jump up on people but I will jump on the couch to get snuggles from you. \n\nI am pretty much potty trained so just keep me on a good schedule so I can do my business outside. I do pull on a leash when I am first on it but I settle down quickly after the initial excellent wears off.  A training collar will help, as will a backyard to run in or a doggie park to play in.  \n\nI\u2019d be happy to share my new home with other dogs, cats or kids so what are you waiting for?  Contact the shelter and set up a time to come visit me. You can teach them 972-382-3647 ext 4 or adoptionsmoh@gmail.com. \n\nOnce vetted I\u2019ll be ready for my forever home.",

He's beautiful, soft and super cuddly. He's potty trained and crate trained. He knows sit, shake and down. Gray is super athletic. He loves to go on walks and runs. He's not food or toy aggressive after he's established that he's the Alpha, but should be an only dog. He really wants to be number one and the only one. He gets jealous when affection and attention is shown to the other dogs. He loves playing with stuffed animals, chewing on bones and being rewarded with treats and affection. He responds only to love, safety, consistency and calm.\n\nGray loves being outside and inside. Gray has anxiety about riding in the car. He needs to be crated in a car. Finally, Gray's biggest issue is his reactivity or trigger to stress and his short temper. Gray would do best with a single human household.",

            "description": "Stella is a 5/6 year old pit bull/boxer female. She is the most sweetest girl in the world. She loves her bed and loves getting belly rubs while she\u2019s in her bed. She could sleep all day/night especially if it\u2019s raining. She listens to sit, stay, come etc, and she knows her name very well. She is house and crate trained. She\u2019s very protective and will watch you and make sure you\u2019re not being hurt. She would do best in a house with no other dogs/ cats were not sure of, but she does get along with my 1 year old GS mix that is 90lbs. She\u2019s amazing and is the best pup around. \n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $425",

Thankfully, her owners were determined to get help for Zuri and surrendered her. We were and are honored that we were able to step up. \nZuri's treatment for Addison's has been successful, and she is now on maintenance for this condition. She will require the medication (which costs about $175 for a 3 month supply) for the remainder of her life. \n\nZuri is a very nice dog that gets along well with other dogs. She is crate and house trained, and very well behaved. She does well with adults and with kids and will make a great addition to any home.\n\nIf you are in the Louisville, KY area, and would like to meet Zuri, please complete an adoption application, which can be found at https://www.cognitoforms.com/SaveOneSoul/SaveOneSoulAdoptionApplication\n\nOur adoption fee is only $150 and includes vaccinations, spay/neuter and microchipping.\n",

Before he joined the rescue, he was hit by an 18 wheeler, which landed him in the shelter with a broken leg and pelvis. The shelter vet did surgery on his leg and had a pin and plate put in, but the broken pelvis did not need surgery, just crate rest for 6 weeks. It is a miracle he even survived! When we took Yukon back for his post surgery check-up, we learned that the plate and pin in his leg were actually too big and had caused a major infection. Poor Yukon had to have surgery on his leg again. Dr. Dean at Mustang Surgical had to remove the plate and pins and replace them with an external fixture and a bone graft in order to fix the fracture and treat the infection. He is finally done with 8 additional weeks of crate rest and months of laser and water therapy and is ready for his forever home! This is what Yukons foster Mom has to say about this boy: Yukon loves car rides, ice cubes, toys and treats. He is learning basic commands and is crate trained and potty trained. He is such a sweet boy who loves to be with his people! His ideal home would be an active home with another dog that likes to play.\" Due to his breed, no apartments please.

This is what her current care taker has to say about her: Annie is super smart, she knows how to sit, lay, shake and place on command. She is kennel trained and potty trained. She is super loving and super protective. She does better with boy dogs, but would be best as an only dog. Shes a typical Shepherd, high prey drive so no cats or small dogs. I dont have a problem introducing her to new people, but shes very protective when strangers approach me on a walk or someone comes to the door. Shes probably not the dog for an inexperienced handler. She can be nervous around kids so a home without kids or with teenagers would be ideal. She will play catch until your arm falls off!

From Fiona's foster Mom: \"Fiona is such a sweet and happy girl! She loves to play with other dogs (no cats) and toys and is also happy just being by her people. She does play very hard so she needs another dog that also likes to play a lot. She also plays very loud! She is potty trained and crate trained. She does tend to jump up on people out of excitement when she first meets them, we are working on correcting this behavior, but due to this no children under the age of 13. \n\nIf you would like to adopt a dog from Rescue Row please fill out an application at www.rescuerowinc.org \n\n*Please check your junk email folder if you do not receive a response from a Rescue Row member within 48 hours.\n\n*You must live within an hour of the DFW Metroplex because we do trial adoptions and require a homecheck\n\n*Our adoption fees are as follows (paid by cash or a check made out to Rescue Row):\n\n Dogs 12 weeks-6 months old: $300 adoption fee\n\n Dogs 7 months and older: $275 adoption fee\n\nRescue Row is a 501(c)3 (non-profit) all volunteer dog rescue organization serving the DFW Metroplex.

            "description": "Xena has not had an easy life. She was originally found on Dowdy Ferry Road in Dallas, which is a huge dumping ground for dogs. She was then taken to Dallas Animal Services to do her stray hold, but no one came looking for her. \nWhen she joined the rescue, she had a severe Upper Respiratory Infection that cleared up with the help of medication. A few weeks later she was rushed to the vet after collapsing, revealing that she had Vasculitis, a condition that attacks the blood vessels and limits blood circulation to certain parts of the body. In Xena's case, she became unable to walk and her back legs would collapse underneath her. With the assistance of antibiotics, Xena was able to walk again! \nUnfortunately, her problems weren't over yet. She then suffered from bloat where her stomach blew up to the size of a cantaloupe. Thankfully, after a successful surgery Xena pulled through once again! \nHer last challenge to overcome was Megaesophagus, a condition where the esophagus is enlarged making it impossible to keep food or water down. This condition arose suddenly and disappeared just as fast. Xena ate in an adorable doggy high-chair for a couple of months and had limited water intake along with medication until when suddenly, one day she could keep her food and water down without throwing up! \nXena has proven so many times that what doesn't kill you makes you stronger and managed to keep an adorable pittie smile on her face the entire time! She is such a joy and is so loved by everyone who meets her. She is a true warrior princess and now it is time for Xena to find her forever family. Xena is 8 years old and weighs 90 lbs. She would do best in a home with a larger sized dog who likes to play or she would be fine be an only dog and getting all of the love herself. She loves toys! Even though she has been to training, she still gets overly excited on walks when she sees other dogs. No cats or apartments please. Also due to her size, children over the age of 10 years old would be best. She loves little kids, but does not know her size and may knock them down on accident.\n\nIf you would like to adopt a dog from Rescue Row please fill out an application at https://form.jotform.com/91767055990166 \n\n*Please check your junk email folder if you do not receive a response from a Rescue Row member within 48 hours.\n\n*You must live within an hour of the DFW Metroplex because we do trial adoptions and require a homecheck\n\n*Our adoption fees are as follows (paid by cash or a check made out to Rescue Row):\n\n Dogs 12 weeks-6 months old: $300 adoption fee\n\n Dogs 7 months and older: $275 adoption fee\n\nRescue Row is a 501(c)3 (non-profit) all volunteer dog rescue organization serving the DFW Metroplex.

PLEASE COMPLETE OUR ADOPTION APPLICATION INSTEAD*\n\nMalachi-TX is with his family in Pasadena, TX. Please read ALL the information in his listing before applying for him. If you would like to be considered as a potential adopter for him, please complete our adoption application at http://www.idogrescue.com/adoption_application. If you have completed an application in the last 3 months and meet the requirements for Malachi\u2019s new home, you can email us at rescue@idogrescue.com and let us know you are interested in him.\n\nWe will review your application and let you know if you made our short list of applicants. We base our adoption decisions on what is in the best interest of our dogs. Please note our adoption policies are in place for the safety and welfare of our dogs - your understanding is appreciated. We are all volunteers and have jobs, families, pets of our own to care for - we do the best that we can to get back to you in a timely manner. We believe in taking time to go through our thorough process to try to match the dog with the best fit for that dog. Our adoption process may take 2-4 weeks. You must be approved to adopt before we will schedule a meet and greet. We expect approved adopters to visit the dog in his foster home within a short period of time of being approved to adopt the dog. Our adoption process involves vet and personal reference checks, phone interviews and a home visit.\n\nMEET MARVELOUS MALACHI-TX!\n\n*AGE: 5 years (born July 2015)\n \n*WEIGHT: 29 lbs\n \n*FENCE REQUIREMENT: A physical fence is preferred. No electronic fence or e-collar will be allowed as we feel this would not set him up for success.\n \n*COAT TYPE: wavy, low-shedding. His new family should be prepared to brush his coat regularly and for the expense of having him groomed every 6-8 weeks or so. This is approximately $100 per groom.\n\n*ENERGY LEVEL: low to moderate. Loves to play occasional fetch with his stuffed bunny, but when he\u2019s finished he\u2019s done. \n \n*DOGS: He\u2019s done great once he\u2019s got to know them. He would be fine as an only dog. If there is a dog in his new home, he would prefer older dogs instead of a puppy. \n \n*CATS: N/A, but I think he\u2019d do great once he got use to them.\n \n*KIDS: Kids 13+. He gets stressed around small children and growls at them to let them know this. \n\n*CAR: Is not a fan of the car; he whines but doesn\u2019t get car sick. He is OK with short trips of 30 minutes or so.\n \n*CRATE: He is crate trained, but has not used his crate in years.\n \n*HOUSE TRAINED: Yes\n \n*LEASH: Yes, walks great on a leash. He enjoys walking!\n \nMalachi is a 5 year old male Parti-colored mini-Labradoodle who is looking for a new home. He is with his family in Pasadena, TX near Houston. His family loves him very much but feel their home is stressing Malachi too much and want him to have a new home with a calmer environment. They have two young children and this stresses Malachi too much. Here is what they have to say about Malachi.\n\nMalachi is a wonderful dog who was our first child and we love him so very much. He\u2019s loyal and he loves his humans. He loves to cuddle, loves his family, is well-behaved, and loves to be petted.\n\nThough this transition will be hard we really believe this is what is best for Malachi, not us. We got Malachi early into our marriage and he was our only child for many years. We welcomed our miracle baby two years ago and we have desperately tried to grow the bond between him and baby. As our baby has grown they have never developed a relationship that we had such high hopes for. We accepted that and have even kept them separated as best as possible. \n\nMalachi wants to be with his people and we didn\u2019t find this to be fair either. Baby and Malachi are always supervised together. Malachi has never bit our children but he growls when our toddler gets too close or runs in his direction. He gets extremely anxious and will hide behind one of us or is pacing the room for a safe place to go, even with the availability of kid free space. As we know kids are not perfect we have never allowed our babies to climb on or hurt Malachi.\n\nWe have praised both dog and babies when they have a good interaction and corrected when things don\u2019t. Usually things deescalate quickly but there has been one time Malachi snarled at me. Again, he has never bit or snapped at any one. This was completely out of character for Malachi and only happened one time. While we have tried all avenues to keep Malachi with us we feel the best interest for him is to not live with tiny humans that are loud and fast moving.\n\nMalachi has allergies \u2013 food and environmental that have become worse since the children were born due to his anxiety around them. He chews his skin more when he is anxious. His anxiousness is heightened around the kids and this suppresses his immune system and the anxiety makes him chew more. We\u2019ve seen multiple vets to get opinions on his allergies. We have eliminated certain food allergies and he is on a prescription rabbit food that costs $100/bag for a 6 week supply. Though he does do well on the food alone he does suffer from environmental allergies and will get occasional flare-ups. He is bathed in a special shampoo and never allowed perfume when he is groomed. When he gets allergy flares, he may get a skin infection and crusty skin. He takes antibiotics, Prednisone and Apoquel when his allergies flare.\n\nMalachi is well-behaved. He rings bells that we have on our back door to let us know when he needs to go outside. If those aren\u2019t there he will just sit patiently by the door until you let him out. He goes outside just to do his business so we usually wait at the door or go outside with him. If you close the door he will lightly scratch the door and when that doesn\u2019t work he will bark to let me know he\u2019s ready to come in.\n\nHe is allowed on our furniture and sleeps in our bed with us. He will usually sleep at the end of our bed or between our legs. Though, we have woken up to him a time or two smack dab in the middle of us sharing our pillow sleeping on his back like a human, ha!\n\nMalachi has never showed food aggression and loves to get treats! He listens well and knows sit, stay, and come. He walks very well on leash. We have only ever had great reports when he gets groomed they say he does wonderfully and he is so sweet. He makes a wonderful companion and such a well behaved, perfect family member.\n\nThe type of home in which we feel Malachi will succeed:\n-children 13+\n-owner(s) willing to help him with his allergies. This may be life-long issue and may involve several vet visits over the course of his lifetime.\n-calm lower-stress home\n\nMalachi is neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, crate trained and house trained. He is heartworm negative and is current on heartworm, flea/tick preventives.\n\nADOPTION FEE $100\n\nOUR ADOPTION FEES RANGE FROM $100 - $750 depending on the dog. The following is a general guide, but each dog is assessed individually. It currently costs IDOG an average of over $400 for basic vet, grooming, and foster care on each dog; that does not allow for the ones who get sick, need surgery, have special needs, or are heartworm positive.\n\nADOPTION FEES:\nUnder 6 months $550 and up\n6 months to 2 years $450 and up\n2 years - 4 years $350 and up\n4 years + $100 and up\nSpecial Needs fee/donation assessed on individual basis\n\nTO APPLY FOR THIS DOG, PLEASE COMPLETE THE APPLICATION ON OUR WEBSITE:\nhttp://www.idogrescue.com/adoption_application",

Murphy is both. He loves people and is also dog friendly. He loves to walk and play and definitely brightens your day! He is depending on Santa to find him a forever home! I happen to know that he has totally stolen at least one staff member's heart and is willing to work his magic again!\n\nMurphy is around 1 year old, neutered, and up to date on shots. He weighs around 50lbs. Murphy will need a fenced-in yard. He probably would not be good with cats. Probably would be ok in a home with older/considerate children.\n\n1/27/2021 Murphy is a fun-loving and joyful Cattle Dog mix who arrived at the shelter in July. Sweet Murphy weighs approximately 50lbs and while excited to go on walks, he calms down after he's walked for a few minutes. He loves playing with other dogs, is active, and would appreciate a fenced in yard and a somewhat active family. He would probably be good with older children that respect animals. He is so much fun and would be a fantastic companion.\nJackson County Animal Shelter 86 County Farm Rd, Cottageville, WV 25239 Google map to our location: https://goo.gl/j2faZf Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/JacksonCountyAnimalShelter\nShelter Hours: Mon-Fri 11-4 or by appointment Sat/Sun Closed\n\nAdoption Application: http://form.jotform.us/form/51408614450146 Rescue Application: http://form.jotform.us/form/51744619866165\n\nFor rescue or long distance adoption inquiries, please use this form to contact us: http://form.jotform.us/form/51806042497154\nPhone (for local calls only): 304-372-6064\nRescues and long-distance adopters: We are rescue friendly and PA-licensed!

He is a real treasure, better than any 5 golden rings!   Odie was hit by a car the beginning of September and his back was broken.   He had a CT Scan and the doctors decided against surgery because they felt the risk was potentially greater than the reward.   Odie did very well on cage rest for several months followed by physical therapy and was very determined that he was going to walk again.   He was finally cleared to be neutered and is now ready to start his new life.\n\nOverall he doesn't have a lot of restrictions but will need a single story home (no stairs) and should be limited with jumping on and off of things.\n\nDue to COVID-19 we are a little more limited on volunteers and the availability (and safety) of home visits.   Local applications are given first priority and some out of town areas will not be able to be processed.\n\nAt this time, we will only be able to process applications that have an excellent current vet history.  If you haven\u2019t had a pet or verifiable vet history we will not be able to process your application.   \n\nIf you are interested in adopting please complete our Adoption Application by copying and pasting the following link into your web browser: http://www.caninecastaways.org/adoption-application\n\nFor a full list of dogs we currently have for adoption use this link:  https://www.caninecastaways.org/adoptable-dogs\n\n\nMEDICAL INFO:\n\n\nThe following has been or will be done for this dog...\n- Basic Exam by Veterinarian\n- Spayed or Neutered\n- Heartworm Tested\n- Placed on heartworm preventive\n- Basic Bloodwork\n- Urinalysis\n- Microchipped\n- Intestinal Parasite Exam and medication\n- Vaccinations\n- Placed on Flea preventive\n\n\nADOPTION DONATION: $250\n\n\nThis adoption donation helps to cover the vet expenses for this dog including heartworm preventive which is dispensed at the initial vet visit and then goes with the dog at adoption. All vet records will be provided to adopter. \n\nVisit us at www.caninecastaways.org",

She came to Labs and More pregnant and has spent the last several weeks caring for her pups. Now she is ready to put motherhood behind her in favor of a forever home to call her own. Yule likes to come up to you for pets. She is an explorer looking for an active family ready to bring her on all sorts of adventures. Yule is a confident dog that would benefit from a job. She settled in quickly to her foster home where she is housetrained and enjoys pack walks with her family. She is fostered with several dogs big and small and gets along with all of them. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting Yule, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt.

Rumor has it she's also visited our city shelter. You might be wondering why she's gotten out so much. Well her family has an a disabled child who we guess was accidentally letting Bella out. Bella is very lucky that she was never hit by a car on her adventures. Life on the streets is no life for any dog. We are so thankful we can give Bella the chance at a safer life. \n\nBella can be a runner, as her previous history has shown, so a home that can keep her safely contained will be a must. She also doesn't do well with cats and is reactive to dogs so a home as an only pet would be ideal for her. Her reactivity to other dogs includes leash reactivity if she sees other animals when out on walks. Other than her issues with other animals she is sweet, gentle and calm and would make an ideal companion for someone looking for their one and only furry friend.

            "description": "Shepherds are amazing and loyal companions and Champion (Champ) is no exception. He sat at the shelter with a broken scapula and although in excruciating pain it never altered his amazingly sweet personality. Champ had been picked up as a stray by Kern County Animal Services. They have no idea how he was injured but we suspect he'd been hit by a car. We scheduled an appointment with a specialist but Champ was lucky and the specialist did not recommend surgery but instead continued crate rest and slow walks to aide in his recovery. \n\nChamp is now fully healed and ready for adoption. He will always walk with a bit of a hitch to his step but it doesn't hinder his mobility or negatively impact his quality of life. Champ is a super sweet dog and great with people of all ages. He is not good with other animals and very reactive when he sees them. He'll need to be the only animal in his future adoptive home. \n\nIf you've been looking for a big, beautiful, protective shepherd Champion is your boy!

Sadly, we are no longer able to respond to every application, but will contact the one that is a good match within 3 days.\nRavioli is a little 6 yr old 5.5 lb apple headed chihuahua with beautiful big eyes, big ears and a sweet personality.  She is very sweet and pretty confident and social for such a little girl as long as she is around people knows.   As most tinies, the world of strangers can be scary for her.   She likes attention and loves snuggles with her person, she is the ultimate lap dog and will follow you around all day.  She is doing well with dogs and cats in her foster home but is bossy.    Ravioli came to us with really bad dental disease and had a cleaning and extractions.  Sadly her jaw was made weak by the rotten teeth and it broke.  She is doing well in recovery, already eating like a champ so we know in no time she will be back no normal.   She is too small for childen under 13 and super rambunctious dogs.     As many tinies she has bad knees but they dont bother her.\nMost of our dogs are not available to an out of the area adoption because of difficulty to follow up.  If you do not live within a 2 hr drive of Orange County, please email us before applying to see if the dog you are interested is may be a candidate for long distance adoption.    We only make consider long distance adoptions for dogs who have been in our rescue for 6 plus months with no local candidates.\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our rescues, please visit our main website for adoption procedures at www.pupsandpals.net and then fill out our application.  Please note that we are all volunteers so it may take up to 3 days to process your application, but you will hear back from us if your application is a good match for the pet. \nWe do not have a shelter so individual appointments must be made to meet the pet you are interested in.  Our pets are fostered/boarded all over LA and Orange County.  \nThis pet is altered, vaccinated, microchipped, and has had a brief temperament evaluation to help us determine what type of  a home he/she would thrive in.  Please note that we put lots of time and effort to make sure our pets are ready to be someone's perfect pet before they go home.... and to make sure that we will have the best possible match for this pet we do require an : application, interview, adoption fee and in some case a home check.  \nListed for adoption: 12/30/2020\nAdoption fee: $300\nPLEASE DO NOT call or email to see if a pet is available.  We update our pages daily so if he/she is pictured here in the available dogs section, we are accepting applications at this time.",

            "description": "Please read the dog's entire bio before you apply.  Sadly, we are no longer able to respond to every application, but will contact the one that is a good match within 3 days.\nMcClane is a male 5 yr old terrier mix, maybe with a beagle.  He has short terrier like wiry coat, a sweet disposition and soulful eyes.   McClane is 20-21 lbs.   He is very shy and taking a bit to come out of his shell but does like meeting new people.  He loves walks and walks really well on the leash (no pulling).    He is afraid of loud sounds and prefers women over men.  He has some separation anxiety so someone who is home much of the time would be best.   No small children as he does not enjoy fast movements.  He is good with non-bossy dogs.   McClane had a dental cleaning with a few extractions, so his teeth will be sparkly clean.\nMost of our dogs are not available to an out of the area adoption because of difficulty to follow up.  If you do not live within a 2 hr drive of Orange County, please email us before applying to see if the dog you are interested is may be a candidate for long distance adoption.    We only make consider long distance adoptions for dogs who have been in our rescue for 6 plus months with no local candidates.\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our rescues, please visit our main website for adoption procedures at www.pupsandpals.net and then fill out our application.  Please note that we are all volunteers so it may take up to 3 days to process your application, but you will hear back from us if your application is a good match for the pet. \nWe do not have a shelter so individual appointments must be made to meet the pet you are interested in.  Our pets are fostered/boarded all over LA and Orange County.  \nThis pet is altered, vaccinated, microchipped, and has had a brief temperament evaluation to help us determine what type of  a home he/she would thrive in.  Please note that we put lots of time and effort to make sure our pets are ready to be someone's perfect pet before they go home.... and to make sure that we will have the best possible match for this pet we do require an : application, interview, adoption fee and in some case a home check.  \nListed for adoption: 12/30/2020\nAdoption fee: $300\nPLEASE DO NOT call or email to see if a pet is available.  We update our pages daily so if he/she is pictured here in the available dogs section, we are accepting applications at this time.",

            "description": "ADOPTION REQUIREMENTS\nFenced yard\na canine sibling would be great but not required in the right home\n\nMy name is Bodee. I am a Great Pyrenees/Lab mix and I am in the market for a new home. I was found roaming the neighborhood all by myself and no one ever came for me. My foster mom says I am the best boy ever and she wouldn't care if I ever left but she can't keep another dog and still be able to help the others like me with no family. I am very very thin. Way underweight my vet says. We are working on that though and I have gained a few pounds since coming here. I am great with other dogs. Even littles and I love kids. Not too sure about cats though as I haven't been around them. I am crate trained and housebroken and I love car rides. I am about 3 years old and will weigh about 100 lbs once I am at a healthy weight. \n\nIf you would like to meet Bodee, send us am email to theloveofk9s@yahoo.com and we will get back with you as quick as we can.\n\nAdoption donation pays for all vetting...my neuter, a heart worm test, all vaccinations, deworming, flea prevention, a microchip and a wellness exam",

Information as of 12/3/20.\n\n\"Stella, 38lbs, Super cuddly, She knows sit, wait, shake and high five.  She sits and waits when you feed her, and will wait for your command to eat.  She is house trained, and walks great on a leash.  She is VERY smart, and learns and listens quickly.  She is not aggressive towards children, but does seem afraid of them when they jump and scream.  Back story:  We found and adopted her 3 years ago from the streets.  She was extremely malnourished, and decided to keep her.  Other than being skinny, she was healthy and took to our home immediately.  She lived with us and our two other older dogs (female chihuahua and male terrior mix) peacefully for 2 years.  This past year, she has expressed aggression towards our older male dog.  The aggression seems to stem around their possessiveness of my fiance.  They guard her from each other for her attention.  My old boy is almost 9 now, and I need to protect his well being, so I need to find Stella a new home.  I feel with a family where she is the only pet would be best.  She's extremely athletic, loves to play, hike, and climb.\"",

I am almost 90 pounds and still growing, but a very good big boy.  . I'd like to be in a home with adult humans only, because I'll just accidentally knock over little ones.  My favorite part of the day is snuggling with my foster mom on the couch and netflixing! I don't need much, just a family that will love me forever ? Is that you?\n\nI am best with dogs who are on the larger size since I am such a Big Guy. \n\nBongo is an approximately 85 lb male mix of possibly American bulldog and staffie.   We think he is around 6 years old and he has a very sweet and calm personality.   \n\nPlease contact Christine at christinerescueexpress@gmail.com if interested",

I am enjoying the company of the other dogs as well as humans of all sizes. I do have a high prey drive so should go to a home without any cats or small animals. I do like sitting on the couch and staring intently outside watching the birds and squirrels. I am learning to not jump on windows, but it's a work in progress. I love treats and will take them nicely. I no longer sleep in my kennel, I prefer a to sleep on a dog bed next to your bed. I haven't had any accidents. I love to chew on bones or laying next to you in bed or on the couch.\n\nI am getting better with the younger two high energy dogs in my foster home, but would prefer calmer dogs. I don't think I would like a dog park - especially since I do have a high prey drive with squirrels and birds.\n\nI had a bath and did great with it. My foster also trimmed my nails - I didn't care to have that done but was a good girl for it.\n\nAdoption fee includes: Full veterinary exam, dental, alter, prepaid microchip, dewormed, Rabies vaccine, DAPP vaccine, Bordetella vaccine, 4DX\n\n, flea/tick and heartworm preventative while in rescue. Adoption fee: $195.00",

            "description": "Sweet Giblet found her way to Coastal Pet Rescue over the Thanksgiving Holiday. She is a typical Lab puppy; always up for excitement and adventure, who seems to get along with most other dogs.\nStill in training, she walks better with a harness and will need someone who can help her with her leash skills and other commands. She will also need a home with a fenced in yard where she can have lots of play time, and would probably do well with an active family.\nGiblet will reward you daily with hugs and kisses and will make some lucky person a wonderful companion.\n\n\n\nOur dogs are split between residence at our shelter, Camp Pawsawhile Retreat, and foster homes. Meet and greets are available by appointment only. Please complete an adopter profile to set up your meet and greet: http://coastalpetrescue.org/adopt/profile\n\nAdoption Fees:\nKittens: $60, Cats (1 year plus): $50, Puppies: $250, Adult Canines (1 to 6 years): $200, Seniors (7 years plus): $100 (unless otherwise specified). Adoption fees are not a tax-deductible donation as allowed by IRS regulations. Adoption fees help to offset the cost of the pet's care incurred by Coastal Pet Rescue, which are generally 2 to 3 times the adoption fee amount.\nSome special circumstances may change the fee; see pet's listing for actual adoption fee.\n\nAll Coastal Pet Rescue pets are current on shots, microchipped* and spayed/neutered prior to adoption. Adopters are responsible for any shots that may be due after adoption (particularly for kittens and puppies that must have three rounds of shots to be protected).\n\nMicrochip:\nCPR has implanted a microchip as part of the adoption process and the chip is included in the adoption fee. However, some chip companies require a registration fee varying from $9.99 to $19.99. The registration fees are the responsibility of the adopter and are NOT included in the CPR adoption fee. Adopters may add this cost to their adoption fee to have CPR register the chip on their behalf.\n\n30 Days Pet Insurance: \nAs a Petfinder member, all adopters are entitled to a free 30 day insurance policy through PetFirst. Coastal Pet Rescue is not responsible for this policy. Adopters must call PetFirst\u2019s toll-free number 855-710-7387 to activate the coverage. If adopters fail to call, the policy will not be activated.\n",

            "description": "Dink has quite an amount of energy! Pitties are an energetic breed on its own and we think Dink has a bit of another energetic breed mixed in too! Dink is super quiet in his crate, but once he\u2019s out, he\u2019s ready to go-go-go! Dink had to be quarantined for doggie cold when he arrived to foster so we are still getting to know how he is in a house on a daily basis. Dink is appropriately quite active and playful in the yard. He enjoys chasing toys, but he does not bring them back for fetch. Dink seems to like to learn skills for treats in non-distracting environments.\n\nWe believe he would love to be a hiking partner. He seems ok with trying new things like going new places, even the vet, so he could make a good adventure partner. He is friendly towards people he has met at the shelter he was at and in his foster home (only a handful of people due to Covid, however he was very friendly towards all). He jumps on people still, but is learning that keeping his paws on the ground will produce treats and attention and jumping does not. He is showing improvement with the jumping. He tends to swallow pieces of soft toys that he gets really into chewing so hard toys are preferred for this guy. (He does not consume random items or fluff on the floor though.) He has learned that when there is a piece of soft broken toy in his mouth that he is about to swallow, and his name is called, he can drop the piece and come to the human for a treat which has worked well for the times he has had soft toys and been allowed to chew them with high supervision.\n\nDink seems to either be quite excited/amped up when his toys are touched (anticipates the toy will be thrown or played tug with) OR he doesn't really want his toys to be touched when he's really into playing with them. All we have seen in foster is a few growls when his toys were physically touched and one time he stood over a toy and growl/barked after he had been intensely playing with it and a human reached for it. This does not permeate daily life (humans can walk closely by him with a toy he has without issue and touch other toys in the room that are not near him (a few feet away)). Dink can easily be managed by not taking toys from him without trading for a treat or calling him away from the toy for a treat. He responded very well to a few initial \"trading for treats\" sessions. Dink's adopter will be provided lifelong training support for free for this behavior from WTFR's trainer. Dink has never bitten a person in foster, however Dink would do best in an experienced adult only home so he can be successful with progress on this toy matter.\n\nDink had an introduction session with a neutral dog who was quickly overwhelmed by his play style and Dink did not give the dog space as he tried to walk away many times. We are concerned that Dink's easily highly excited personality around other dogs could agitate another dog to the point of high discomfort and correction from the dog. We don't think Dink would take a correction from a dog well as he easily becomes overly amped up and we don't want to see Dink in a situation with another dog where he may behave in an undesirable manner. This, plus Dink's possible desire to keep his toys to himself, leads to our belief that he would live most harmoniously in a home as the only pet. He has been non-reactive towards dogs and people on leash outside.\n\nDink has not shown any food guarding however we do not touch dogs while they are eating in foster nor do we take their food away. Dink eats in his crate in foster and when we latch the door by his food bowl while he is eating he does not seem uncomfortable. We do not know how Dink would feel if a dog were to come near him while he is eating or chewing on a snack stick.\n\nLiving in a home consistently with opportunities to play and exercise to get his energy out appropriately, plus basket muzzle conditioning and appropriate, safe socialization with friendly, savvy dogs could lead to Dink being able to make dog friends. We have not seen any aggressive behavior from Dink towards other dogs in foster (i.e. dogs crated next to him, when he walks by other crated dogs, when other dogs walk by his crate).",

He was not housebroken but has learned to use a pee pad in the house.\n\nHe is surrounded with three foster brothers, one canine and two felines. He is cat curious and does like to chase the cat if the cat runs.\n\nBamBam and Betty are very much bonded and would need to be adopted together. He takes care of Betty and gets a little anxious when he doesn't see her close by. He is very worried about her whenever you touch her or put her sweater on her, he will come to make sure she is ok. \n\nBamBam is up to date on his vaccinations, neutered and microchipped.\n\nHe is just an amazing little guy who deserves to find a home that will give him love and attention, something we don't believe he has had. He is ready for a real home and he is ready to start a new year with you!\n\nHis foster mom feels that since they are so small, she wouldn\u2019t advise a home with small children. They would do well in an adult only home.\n\nIf you are interested in knowing more about BAMBAM and BETTY, please contact Mary Alice with any questions and to receive adoption applications for them.

She was accompanied by a young male chihuahua, which we feel may be her son. She was scared, timid and dirty. When the family came outside to the yard, she ran and hid while her son, BamBam, barked. They were scared but when approached, they were very friendly.\n\nThey were brought into the home, bathe, fed and kept warm. All efforts were made to find their family, but no one ever came forth. They are now ready to find their new furever home and family.\n\nBetty is a sweet, gentle spirited lady. Betty is a tiny little thing, just 3 lbs. of loveableness. The vet thinks she is about 7+ years of age. She wants your attention, loves to be in your lap, snuggling with you in bed. She is content to just chill. She likes to eat, walk around a little then back to bed. She likes her sweaters, as she is cold a lot. She would thrive on human companionship (aka couch potato).\n\nShe is surrounded with three foster brothers, one canine and two felines. She gets along with the dog and not interested in the cats.\n\nHer foster mom feels that since she and BamBam are so small, she wouldn\u2019t advise a home with small children. They would do well in an adult only home.\n\nShe may be shy at first but give her time to trust you and she will have you wrapped around her little paws!!! Once she trusts you, she will follow you around everywhere you go. She loves to give kisses. \n\nBetty is up to date on her vaccinations, spayed and microchipped.\n\nShe is just an amazing mellow little lady who deserves to be spoiled and pampered. Betty is ready for a real home and she is ready to start a new year with you!\n\nShe and BamBam are very much bonded and would need to be adopted together. She gets a little concerned when she doesn't see him close by.\n\nIf you are interested in knowing more about BETTY and BAMBAM, please contact Mary Alice with any questions and to receive adoption applications for them.

Ruby absolutely adores people and greets everyone with a wagging tail and a hug. She is house trained and crate trained although she does enjoy sleeping in bed under the covers. Ruby loves to run around and play so she would like a yard where she has the space to run. When she is not playing you can find her lounging on the couch or in her bed.. she loves a good nap. She is a clown and is always making us laugh. Ruby likes walks and car rides. To apply to adopt Ruby fill out an application at Www.ruffhouserescue.org/adopt",

Please email the completed application to newleashrescue2018@gmail.com\n\n***please read entire bio BEFORE applying or inquiring***\n\nTess is a 6.5 year old French Bulldog who was released from a breeder.   She weighs about 18 pounds.  Tess is NOT housetrained and has frequent accidents.  She does not understand puppy pads.  She often can drink a little too much water if allowed and urinate frequently.  She will need a family committed to working on house training and potentially looking at diapers if needed. \n\nIn rescue,  Tess has been spayed,  had a dental, and had an umbilical hernia repaired in addition to bloodwork and regular vetting.  Tess's bloodwork showed her ALT slightly elevated in her liver.  She has been put on a hepatic supplement, but will need a bloodwork recheck in in March to recheck her results.  Her other liver numbers are in line, so her adoptive family needs to monitor her results and trend in bloodwork results over time.  If her ALT rises over time, further diagnostics up to an ultrasound may be needed as recommended by a vet. \n\nTess requires a family who can support her and make sure her veterinary needs in the future are taken care of no matter what. \n\nTess is good with other dogs, but is unknown with cats.  She is not living with small children.  Recommended with kids ages 8 and up. \n\nApplications are reviewed in the order received.  Vet references will be checked.  \n\nAdoption fee is $425.00 + tax (no checks)\n\nFoster to contact: Katie - kit_n_caboodle22@hotmail.com \n\nThis dog will be at our adoption event at the Woodbury PetSmart on Saturday from 11-2 looking for a home!\n\nOur fosters do the best they can to provide all information about the animal's background and temperament while in foster care in their home. An adopters routine and home environment is likely going to be different than that in their foster home. \n\nSometimes there is more that comes out about a dog's personality once they have been able to settle in a home and truly become comfortable. There are great articles out there written about the different stages a pet goes through after adoption, discussing transitions that happen at 3 days, 3 weeks, and 3 months. We highly recommend reading about this - it will help you understand the transition your new pet goes through.",

When we rescued her, we had to hospitalize for a few days to find out what was wrong with her. all this pretty girl needed was her insulin. Which she does take twice per day.\n\nShe is now healthy as a horse and a super happy pup. She is around 8 years young and LITERALLY loves everyone! She gets along with all people and dogs. Unfortunately, this baby does not get along with kitties.\n\nShe is currently located in a wonderful foster home in Aliso Viejo and is ready to meet her furever home.",

In that time, he has learned to walk good on leash. He is crate trained and House trained. We have learned that Tony loves to play with toys and other dogs! His favorite place in sitting on the couch (preferably next to his people). And that he uses his large head to bulldoze into his people and snuggle as close to them as possible. Tony loves his snuggles. Tony would do best in a home with a fenced in yard and No CATS!\n\nAdoption fee $ 200 includes spay/neuter, up to date on vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative \n\nIf you are interested in adopting fill out an application at https://www.petstablished.com/pets/public/928251 by clicking on the adopt button.\n\nOnce your application is approved we will schedule a one on one meet and greet.

He loves to be petted and paid attention to, and he will let you know when he is not done being petted! He has been sledding with the 12-14 year old grand kids and had a great time. He was happy to run and jump on their makeshift sleds as much as they were. He loves to run and play with other neighborhood dogs as well. His current routine is running back and forth along the fence line with the neighbors Shih Tzu's, until they get tired and cannot run any more.\n\nClyde is very energetic and loves his two 1-mile walks everyday. He does still pull some when he spies someone else out and about because he wants to visit everyone, but we are working on that. It will just take a little more time and patience.\n\nHe is smart and quickly learning how to wait at each street corner, as well as sit, shake, and down. He is very treat motivated for learning new things. Clyde is jumping into the car pretty easily, and getting better at car rides. They are not nearly as scary as he once thought. Whether you are spending time in your home office, kitchen or TV room, Clyde is happy to be there to help you as well. He prefers company to being alone and he will tell you when its time for a walk or to just go outside.\n\nWe think Clyde would be extremely happy to have a home where he has a 4 legged playmate he can run and play with, but he would do good if you are just willing to give him extra attention too. Clyde is not fond of crates and would not do well in one\n\nThis fabulous foster is a Doberman Rescue Minnesota foster dog.\n\nPlease read all adoption steps and policies carefully on our website. http://dobermanrescueminnesota.com/adoption-steps/\n\nQualified adopters are within the approved adoption area, and Adopter will be requested to visit this foster dog at the foster family home. Our foster families are generally located within a 250 mile radius of Minneapolis, MN.\n\nAll DRM dogs are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, health checked, microchipped, 4DX tested, and on monthly flea/tick and heartworm prevention.",

No farm animals or cats. Has a good temperament, high prey drive. Loves to cuddle and hang out with his peeps. Can jump a 5 foot pool fence. New owner need to have a solid brick wall minimum 6 foot tall. With nothing that can be used as a stepping stool like a fire pit or flower planter. Binterested? Our Adoption Process... If you are interested in adopting one of our fun loving not so rotten rotties, you will be asked to fill out a questionnaire that will allows us to get to know you better and to make sure the dog you are looking at is a good fit for your family and lifestyle. You can access our questionnaire by going to our website, www.rottenrottie.com click on the forms tab, and fill out the questionnaire and submit it online. After we review your answers, if we feel that the dog that you are interested in, is not a good fit for you and your family, we may recommend a different rottweiler companion. After we determine which Rottweiler(s) is the best for you, we will set up a time so that you can meet him or her at their house, where they will feel most comfortable and act as they normally do. An adoption contract will be signed to finalize the adoption and we do ask for a rehoming fee of $400 for most adults, $250 for most of our seniors 6 years and above for any rottweiler mix of any age (except puppies) . Our fees for puppies fluctuate depending on how much we had to invest into them or their litter, and weather they are purebred or a mix. These funds are necessary so that our organization may continue to rehome rottweilers. ALL of our dogs are sterilized, fully vaccinated and microchipped, heartworm tested negative and come with a collar and a leash. We have also addressed any injury or illness that they had when they came to us, or received in foster care. These problems will be disclosed to the adopter prior to adoption.",

            "description": "Born on 10/8/2019 this Akc registered puppy ended up at our rescue because he proved to be to strong headed for his previous owner. We sent him through two board and train programs to work out some odd behavior that he was displaying and now he is doing terrific. He knows all his obedience commands very well and loves to work. He was adopted by someone who loved him very much but her older rottweiler who is twice Bariks size wants to kill Barik and he is a hard headed rottie that holds a grudge for a long time. There is no convincing him that Baril deserves to live and it's too dangerous for Barik to stay in that home. He was great with all dogs and people. Now he is pretty scared of most dogs but he will eventually warm up to them if they are not a dominant dog. He would do well with any dog of any size that is fair in play and non threatening. He is sensitive of people touching his but. If you touch his butt too much it may trigger him to attack his own butt. Kind of like how a dog chases their tail but he is very vocal about it. .We will not be looking at any applications that come from outside of AZ, nor will we place him in an apartment. We are looking for experienced rottie owners or owners that are strong leaders so be sure to give lots of details in the training section of the application. \n \n\nOur Adoption Process...

She is house trained and doesnt chew or have accidents. Casey loves attention! Although not much of a cuddler, she may occasionally lay her head on your lap. Because she has some hip dysplasia, she would do best in a home with no more than 3-4 stairs.\n\nDespite the hips, she loves longs walks and fetching a ball. She pulls a bit on the leash, so a patient owner is needed. She sometimes barks at random things & likes to spend time in the backyard. For this reason, and her size (70 lbs), she would not be suitable for apartment living.",

We will not respond to petfinder inquiries regarding any information already publicly posted.** Please take time to read the information provided and complete an application if interested.** Incomplete applications will not be considered.**\n\nHi! My name is Quincy! \nI am about 3 years old and I weigh around 14 pounds. I am neutered, current on vaccines,  microchipped, have had a dental cleaning and on heartworm and flea prevention.\nRead my Facebook Bio Here: https://www.facebook.com/466968716999292/posts/1271791859850303/\n\nMy adoption fee is $425.\n\nPlease submit an application if you want to make me part of your family! \nMeet and greets are scheduled with approved adopters. \nCopy the link below and paste it into your browser for an application:\n\nhttp://www.emailmeform.com/builder/form/wACc22HN2JDb60dtb465Z \n\n\nOur adoption process consists of an application, and reference checks. We do home visits when a reference check is not enough. You must be at least 21 years old to apply to adopt.\nPlease fill out all fields as accurately as possible. We will not process incomplete applications. \n\nAdoptions are made on a best home basis. If two excellent applications come in for the same dog, our policy is first in time, first in line. Our goal is to have the very best home for all our dogs. Our dogs are in private foster homes waiting to be adopted. Due to limited foster space, we are unable to hold an animal to be adopted out at a later time.\n\nPlease keep in mind that we do our best to make an educated guess as to the breeds of our rescued pets. In rescue we rarely see the parents of our dogs and puppies, and even when we do, they are usually mixed breeds as well. \n\nWe rely solely on adoption fees and donations to provide care for our rescued animals, many of whom have incurred medical bills that are much higher than any possible adoption fee. The fees received act to help support the organization as a whole, allowing them to continue efforts to rescue animals from high-kill shelters in South Carolina and Georgia.",

Thanks to the kindness and compassionate nurturing of the Humane Society volunteers, Care Baer wakes up every morning (in the clouds of Care-a-Lot) with clean living quarters and a full tummy. He shares smiles with everyone while he enjoys a romp in the bark park and shows off his sense of humor by giving the photographer a \u201ccanine raspberry\u201d. He has a great desire to please his human as he performed literally dozens of instant sit poses while only, even if he wished otherwise, occasionally receiving a treat. Care Baer has a strong athletic stature and pulls hard on leash but is now working with a trainer and is enriching his easy-going, it\u2019s-time-to-enjoy-life personality. He also wanted everyone to know that he prefers to be known as Baer as it perfectly reflects his lets-just-have-some-fun energies. Within the Care Baer tribe, he is called Wish Baer as he looks forward to sharing his life with a loving human.",

Bandi gets along well with other calm dogs and has been caught napping on the couch with one of her cat friends. She has a respectful persona and enjoys the company of kids of all ages. Bandi wanted you to know that she is in perfect health, loves her toys, enjoys romping in the bark park and is very proud of her candy cane tail. This is a curtesy post on Petfinder by the Humane Society for Animals in Rogers, AR. Bandi is not at the HS but resides with her loving caregiver who is the director of Pit Ridge.

During the photo shoot, it is not unusual to have a canine move up quietly behind the photographer and give a gentle touch to his hand just to let him know that he is still there. The process was repeated by Andre, but with an unusual and surprisingly mellow scenario . No physical contact ensued, just the powerful puff of an air jet \u201cnudge\u201d to the back of the hand. Then as the human turned around, Andrea gave his best \u201cWhat, me worry?\u201d stoic pose.  How could you not smile at the creative contact?  Andre was given his name in honor of another gentle giant who lived an exemplary life of entertainment, interwoven with friendship to all. Andre has an easy-going, mellow nature and enjoys sharing time with everyone he meets.",

Her positive energy is contagious and sure to bring you joy and warmth. Diamond would do best with kids over 10 and a family willing to provide her lots of exercise and love. Diamond has been spending lots of time with volunteers going on pawsititve adventures and they have nothing but great things to say! They describe her as the sweetest girl ever, easy walker, polite, happy, and a big cuddler! Diamond is crate and house trained, and knows sit and stay. What more can we say, Diamond would absolutely love a home for the holidays! \n\nAll of our dogs and puppies are spayed/neutered prior to being placed for adoption. They also receive a physical examination from our veterinarian and are tested for heartworm. All of our dogs receive age-appropriate vaccinations (including rabies) and they are treated for fleas. All cats and dogs adopted from our facility are microchipped. \n\nFor more information, please call (440) 951-6122, email adopt@lakehumane.org or visit our website at www.lakehumane.org.

But one thing is certain, I am stunning, very friendly and a very smart girl. I love to run, frolic and romp around in the play yard and dog park. But I know how to settle down nicely when it's time to snuggle. If you are looking to add a calm, happy girl to your pack, please complete the adoption application on hsnb.org/adoptions.

They are inseparable, the best of friends.  They are super playful, very energetic and love to get into mischief together.  They need a fully fenced in yard and someone who can let them be pups.  Both Tobias and Pasta are very loveable and very sweet.  They love to play for hours then nap together in a sunny spot on the floor.  They are working on their leash manners but are awesome pups. They are neutered/spayed and fully vetted.\n\nIf you have the heart and the home for this sweet pair, please contact adoptions@paws-li.org or go to our FB page or call the number listed below.\n \nPioneers for Animals Welfare Society, Inc.\nhttp://www.paws-li.org\nPhone: (631) 306-4616\n",

            "description": "Hi I'm Alvin. I'm a 9 year old neutered terrier mix. I am overall a love bug that loves to cuddle with their person when I find the right one. I am super friendly but I do tend to not like sharing and this includes my person. I get really jealous and sometimes I'm not too nice unfortunately that can even be to my mom or dad. I need some fine tuning still and good guidance by my parental unit as I respond well with direction. For that reason I would be better as an only dog or a dog that is mellow( preferably female) and a strong savvy terrier parent. I would prefer a home with no cats since I really don't like them. A home with an adult (NO KIDS PLEASE) would be the best. I am a very handsome boy looking for the right person to take me home. I come with a 6 week paid course of training at The Complete Canine.\nMy adoption fee is $190 with an additional $21 PACC license fee. To fill out an adoption application, go to www.tucsoncoldwetnoses.com or email info@tucsoncoldwetnoses.com with any questions. I am altered and up to date on vaccines.\n\n*Applications to adopt: wwwTucsonColdWetNoses.com Home Visit / ID and Residence Verification is required. Compliance does not imply or guarantee adoption. Approval is the sole discretion of CWN representative(s).",

With the help of my roommate and the volunteers, I started to relax and enjoy the attention I was receiving. When my roommate was adopted, I also lost my friend. With my alpha personality, I can be particular about who my friends are. I would even be alright if I were an only dog. Recently I found a new pal to walk with and occasionally share some playtime. I\u2019m house trained, use the doggie door, and walk well on a leash. I sit when requested and started learning the commands \u201cdown\u201d and \u201clook\u201d. I can be affectionate but young children tend to make me very nervous. Please call so we can meet and perhaps we\u2019re the perfect match.\nArrived 12-12-2020\n3-year-old female Staffie mix\n\n\nTo view additional animals and find out more about The Animal League of Green Valley, visit our website at www.talgv.org or call (520) 625-3170 between 10 am and 2 pm Monday though Sunday.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Antonia was rescued from a rescue partner in Texas. She was pregnant when rescued and arrived to her foster in West Virginia on December 12th. Just in time too, because she started giving birth on December 16th! She will be available for adoption after her puppies are weaned. She is HW+ and will be treated at SSR's expense. Continue to check back in for updates.\n\nAntonia has begun to open up more since being with us. We will have a better idea of her personality once the puppies have been separated from her. Currently, we know that she is a super sweet girl. She can be very submissive especially to men. She loves to play with toys, but you cannot leave her unattended with them because she enjoys eating them as well. Antonia hates bath time. This is something that she will need help with. She is terrified of the shower. She does pretty well on the leash, she does pull a little bit, but with more practice she would be awesome on a leash. She is very food driven and she is house trained! She has been staying in a large outdoor kennel in our basement with the puppies. We have not crate tested her yet, but I think she would be fine. She does well with other dogs. She has not been cat tested yet. She seems to be fine with kids, but can be a little uneasy, so older kids or dog savvy kids would probably be best. This is all also based off of her being around her puppies. I'm sure once she is away from them she will become more relaxed and not feel the need to protect them. She is so sweet and loves to sit by you and cuddle. She currently does not get up on our furniture no matter how much I try to convince her. A lowkey environment would probably be best for her. We will continue to update this as we learn more about her.If you are an approved adopter and are interested in this dog, please let your case worker know. If you are not yet an approved adopter but are interested, please complete an adoption application!\nYou can review our adoption process, www.shenandoahrescue.org/adoption-process if interested. Donations can be made at shenandoahrescue.org/donate or on PayPal to info@shenandoahrescue.org",

            "description": "Hi, I'm 'Lil Bean! My snaggle teeth and my underbite are hard to not fall in love with. When I'm feeling particularly happy I like to throw myself to the ground and flail around on my back like a maniac! My foster mom picked me up from Animal Control so my background is a mystery.\n\nI am completely potty trained, I have never had an accident in my foster home. I am totally content in my kennel when my foster mom is home and she says I need a time out. I do have some separation anxiety, so being alone in my kennel when my foster mom is not home is a bit stressful for me. My foster mom does have to puppy proof before she leaves because I do get a little anxious, but we are working on it. At night I snuggle up real close with my foster mom, she says I'm the best snuggler! I love it so much some mornings she has to bribe me out of bed!\n\nI am really good at sit, stay and 'look at me.' I am a fast learner and will do just about anything for a treat! Because of the pandemic, regular classes aren't really in the cards for me, but I have met with a trainer and a behaviorist, and they've given my mom some great tools and routines to work on to help me with my confidence out in the world. We are working on my manners. We play fun games that are helping build my confidence and that can be used as distraction tools when I need to be redirected. I have issues with reactivity when seeing other dogs when I'm out and about. We are working hard on this, and I would need someone willing to diligently continue this training. I am starting some new medications that will hopefully calm me a little to help with my separation anxiety and dog reactivity. One day my mom took me to the salon she works at and I got to meet so many people, I was a huge hit! I might not ever be a dog that can go to the dog park or be a patio dog, but I make up for in how much I love my humans.\n\nI haven't had much interaction with kids, but probably wouldn't do well with real little ones till I learned my manners a little better. I just get very excited for new people and get a little jumpy, plus everyone tells me I have a whip for a tail! I'm not sure how I'd do with cats, I saw one once on a walk and wasn't overly interested, and I don't show much interest in all the little animals that come eat at my moms sliding glass door. I am the kind of girl that would need to be the only dog in the house, and would need ongoing work with my excitement level when I see other dogs.\n\nI am a very eager to please girl that just wants to snuggle and be loved. I love my walks just as much as I love my naps. Can't wait to meet you!",

            "description": "Hello.  Meet  Hairy Paw-ter.  I was a stray that was not claimed.  We are unsure of his breed but we uploaded his pictures in our scanner application and it says American Bulldog with American Staffordshire Terrier. He is young around 9 months-1 1/2 years of age.  When he first arrived, we realized that he had very little training.  We have been working on him with leash training and the \"Sit\" command.  He can be a stubborn boy but he is learning!!!  Training will need to continue after his adoption.  He keeps his kennel clean during the day but occasionally has accidents at night.  He has been good with some dogs but isn't always sure about super dominant dogs.  Overall just a work in progress but he is turning into a great dog a little more each day.  A fenced yard is a must as he is very athletic and needs a safe place to exercise.  An active family would be great as well.  The adoption fee is $160.00.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting please fill out our short Adoption Application to start the adoption process. An adoption application can be completed & submitted on our website yorkadoptapet.com or picked up at the shelter (1511 North Platte, York, NE) during open hours, Tuesday-Saturday, Noon-3pm. For more information on any of the dogs available for adoption contact kim@yorkadoptapet.com. All applications need to be approved prior to adoption and approval may take up to 1 week.",

            "description": "Meet Tobee! Tobee is currently enrolled in the P.A.C.K. Program, a 9 week intensive program for routine obedience, agility, and handling training with a prison inmate trainer and he is almost ready to show off all that he has learned to new adopters. His new skills include 'sit', 'stay', 'down', 'place', 'shake' and more! New adopters should realize that PACK Program graduates will require regular, ongoing reinforcement of learned behaviors in order for them to become permanent.\nTobee went in to the PACK Program as a wild child and has made huge strides while there. His handler reports that he has come a very long way in a short period of time and has a calmer state of mind all around. He can be a bit stubborn, they say. So an adopter that is willing and able to be firm and consistent will be key in his continued success. Tobee does well overall with the other dogs in the program, but his energy level while playing can skyrocket and he will become vocal and mouthy. He would enjoy having a dog friend, but monitored playtime until you get to know him will be necessary. Tobee should not go to a home with small dogs or cats. He is house trained and crate trained. He is sweet and friendly, and has all the potential to make some lucky soul a wonderful companion. He has gained a sturdy foundation during the past 9 weeks, it will be up to his adopter to keep building on it.\nTobee is set to graduate at the end of December. If you would like to add him to your home, apply to meet him today!If you are not viewing this adoption listing from our website at www.bdar.org, please go there to get more information, find our adoption application, or submit an inquiry. Our pets are listed for adoption on multiple pet listing sites and we do not always have control over whether those sites are regularly or accurately updated. We also cannot guarantee we will receive forms or inquiries submitted through these 3rd party sites. For questions, call us at 307-514-4024.",

            "description": "Beau Beau is a loving pup who will do anything for a belly rub. He loves a good walk and is quickly learning leash manners; however, he can still be a bit reactive to another barking dog, so needs quick redirection and is able to continue on his way. One of the first things you will notice is his award winning smile that will be sure to make you smile as well. He has shown no issues with eating dog food or drinking water, just a bit of extra drool/water slips out when he is excited. Beau Beau also has a one of a kind tail with a one of a kind wag. While it does not seem to slow him down or cause any pain, it does require a good clean-up from his humans after each time he goes potty as he has difficulty lifting his tail to get it out of the way completely. Having his butt shaved regularly has helped limit any mess and quicken the clean-up process. That being said, he knows the drill once the wipes come out and lays on his side, ready, but he is not always a fan and can become mouthy at times. Beau Beau is for sure still learning how to be a dog and appropriately show his love, but can become mouthy during clean-up time, when he is over tired, when he has some built up energy, and with other dogs. That being said, he has not shown aggression with the dog he lives with, he is just learning how to appropriately interact with other dogs, which will require patience from humans and dogs alike. He is working very hard to become the best dog he can be and knows commands such as: come, sit, leave-it, out, and down. He has been around polite children and has done fine on leash. On walks, he does seem to want to chase cats, so a home with cats would not be ideal. Beau Beau is crate trained and is able to spend the night in his crate and so far has been fine up to 6 hours / day in his crate, however he is a bit of an escape artist, so his crate needs just a bit of extra reinforcement. He eats separate from other dogs, however has shown no signs of food aggression or toy possessiveness. Speaking of toys, Beau Beau loves a comfy bed and a good bone to chew on. In cars, he does just fine, but if he had it his way, he would ride shotgun or in your lap as you drive as he thinks he is the perfect lap dog. Beau Beau would thrive in a house full of cuddles, patience, and belly rubs that is also able to continue training, teach him manners, and provide necessary structure. While nothing slows him down, he does need just a bit of extra help to stay clean and be the best pup he can!",

She is a special needs pup. She is happy and loving, but has some special medical needs and we are looking for that special foster or adoptive home that understands these needs and can give her a happy ever after.\n\nSee she had surgery before arriving to MN and although they tried, they did not fix her issue. We had her go to the U of M and they did a second surgery and fixed as much as they could but she will always have stool issues. They are much better and with a special diet and management, she can have a great life.\n\nHere is what the U said at her check up: She continues to ooze some soft stool out of the right side of the rectum. ( This was present when tail lifted during exam) The mucocutaneous junction is healed but there is no anal sphincter palpable on the right side. She has two large poops daily and doesn't drop stool often until later on when softer stool oozes out of the right side ( about a 1/2 tablespoon. ) This needs to be cleaned off the perianal area otherwise it drops where ever she maybe standing.\n\nHere is what she will need in her home: She need to be put on a low residue diet that only forms firm stool that is easier to clean up after and doesn't stick on her fur.\n\nThere is no surgical fix anymore. So we now need to find that special someone for this special girl.She is good with other dogs and kids. She does like to own her bones and food, so she will need to be worked with on that.Are you that special angel??\n\nor\n\nPETFINDER VIEWERS: Find our applications at www.midwestanimalrescue.org\n\n*The pet you are viewing is a rescued pet which is most often from an animal control facility and does not come with a pedigree. The breed(s) listed are our best guess and are in no way guaranteed. Sometimes the pets appear to be a particular breed(s) in the pictures we receive from our rescue partners and when they arrive we are surprised to see an entirely different breed(s) in person! If you choose to DNA test your adopted pet, test results may vary from company to company and our breed guess may not be reflected in those results as it is just that, our best guess. It is with deep longing that we wish there was a breed called \"cute\" as we believe all of our dogs would fall under this new breed classification!\n\n//",

            "description": "Sophie is a little white fluff of just 9 lbs. She is super sweet, friendly and well mannered. She adjusts quickly to new environments and gets along very well with her foster doggy siblings. \n\nShe is playful and active, and 9 years old. Sophie likes to follow her humans around the house and she camps around her humans when her humans are stationary, working on the computer, watching TV\u2026 etc. \n\nSophie is house trained at her foster home and she goes outside. Sophie is on the quiet side, but she has a loud voice when she barks. Sophie is slim even though she enjoys eating. Her favorite activity is going on walks. She walks well on leash and she walks pretty fast for such a small dog. She is kennel trained and she sleeps in her soft crate at night. Sophie follows instruction well. She  goes into her kennel voluntarily when asked and also she waits for an invitation before joining her humans at the couch or sitting in their laps. \n\nBefore Sophie came to her current foster home, according to the vet, she had an ulcer in her right eye. It has since healed, but the scarring left a cloudy look on the eye. The cloudiness does not hinder her vision nor diminish her overall cuteness. She is very photogenic and especially adorable when she fashioned in her walking harness. She reminds of a miniature size  alpaca.\n\nSophie will be a wonderful pet and delightful addition to her future family. She has not been exposed to children under 10, so children in the home should be at least 10. \n\nIs Sophie's home with you?! \n\nShe will need another dog in the home or someone that is home most of the time.  Children in the home need to be at least 10 years old.  She is located in S. TX\n\nDonations are greatly appreciated for her care.  If would like to donate, please copy and paste this link into your browser:\n\nhttps://donate.smallpawsrescue.org/\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please copy and paste this address in your browser: https://smallpawsrescue.org/pre-adoption-application/\n\nTo visit our home page, please copy and paste this address in your browser:  http://smallpawsrescue.org/",

He will go for walks but he would rather lay on his bed.  He needs to find his humans as soon as possible.  He needs love, toys, and lots of attention.  He loves toys and walks, like most hounds he keeps his sniffer on the ground!  He is not reliable off leash and a tall fenced in back yard is a bonus for him. \n\nIf you would like more info on Remmi or want to schedule a meet and greet, please call us at (757)365-6318.",

            "description": "SAN MATEO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA\n\nMeet Attila.  He is a 2 year old neutered male Anatolian Shepherd mix.  He currently weighs 87 lbs.\n\nAttila has had a very rough life thus far.  He was likely discarded by a farmer in Iran, his country of origin, after  Attila had a broken leg.  He then became a street dog and had to scavenge in order\nto stay alive.  His broken leg healed on its own, not in a perfect manner, but it does not interfere with Attila 's day to day life.  He is quite active and does not seem to have any major limitations.\n\nAttila  was rescued by some very gracious, kind hearted people and made his way to California, where he is currently in foster care, awaiting adoption into his forever home.\nHe has been thoroughly vetted and is currently in good health.  As you can see from one of the pictures, it has been a long journey for him to regain his health and regrow his coat.\n\nAttila  is good with both male and female dogs. He has not been evaluated with cats, livestock or small children.\n\nAttila  is housebroken, walks on leash, knows basic commands and is good with both men and women.\nAttila 's perfect home will be with a very kind, loving and patient person.  A low traffic home without young children is preferred.  Attila will do best in a home with another dog as a companion to him.\n\nAttila is not available for long distance adoption.\n\nPlease contact us for more information on adopting this handsome gentleman.\nasdrescue@gmail.com",

She's making some amazing progress here and is officially available to be shared for adoption! This itty bitty pittie mix is arguably the world\u2019s cutest dog. Weighing in at 35lbs at a year old, she is a forever puppy. She has terrier tenacity, and the heart of a big dog in a small package.\nMegs makes us laugh every day with her antics. While her personality in general is hilarious, she is also FUN. As you can guess from her size, this girl is agile and FAST. She has a ton of drive and will chase the flirt pole until she passes out. She also loves fetch and even hangs from the spring pole! She would be an amazing candidate for agility or fly ball. We also just recently started nose work and she is amazing at it. Because she is so biddable and food motivated, I even think she would enjoy something like rally obedience. She just wants to do stuff, and the specifics do not matter.\nMegs has made vast improvements here. She has made so many human friends, and her barking at strangers is seemingly nonexistent now. She may be wary of new people at first, but it really does not take long to be in her inner circle. Once you are, she is a ball of love. Because of this nervousness, we do not want to send her to a busy city. Her former foster lives in New York and it was too much for her. We have acres here for her to run on, and she is happy as could be. Her \u201cstranger danger\u201d is relatively minimal at this point, and we would absolutely trust her in the hands of someone who understands how to do proper introductions and will continue appropriate socialization.\nMegs has a ton of dog friends here. She is a rough and rowdy player and we have used her as our \u201ctester\u201d dog a few times. We had originally thought she was bombproof with dogs, but she has shown predatory behavior towards small dogs that we find concerning. We have tried to tell her that she herself is also a small dog, but she will hear none of that. We are not comfortable placing her in a home with a small dog but have very few concerns when it comes to larger dogs.\nI hope the pictures are enough to sell someone on this ridiculous girl, but we also love having her here, and are not in a rush to place her with a set up that isn\u2019t perfect. She is in Fairfield Connecticut currently but is available to anyone willing to travel. Contact Muddy Paws Rescue NYC for info on their adoption process and to take this little beast home. She's fully muzzle trained and has fantastic obedience!\n\nMegs is spayed, microchipped and up to date on all age appropriate medical.  Please email adoptions@muddypawsrescue.org if you are interested in adopting Megs!",

She is spayed, microchipped, up to date on all of her vaccinations, and on heart worm prevention. CUTIE PIE AND CHLOE ARE A BONDED PAIR. THEY MUST BE ADOPTED TOGETHER. \n\nCutie Pie & Chloe landed in rescue when their owner passed away and the family member could not take them. Cutie Pie is the smaller of the duo, but she is the dominant one. Cutie Pie and Chloe would work best in a home with no other dogs because Cutie Pie prefers to be the boss. This duo craves lots of love and attention from their humans. Cutie Pie needs a home with a fenced in backyard or needs to be taken out on leash because she is a runner, especially if she sees a cat! \n\nIf you would like to give Cutie Pie and Chloe their forever home, please submit an application at southerncrossbtr.com. Their adoption fee together is $525. They are being fostered in south central KY.\n\nFor a complete listing of all of our available Bostons, or to learn more about SCBTR, please visit our website at www.southerncrossbtr.com.

I\u2019m Stormi, and I\u2019m the one for you!\n\nI\u2019m 20 months old and I weigh 50 pounds. I\u2019m a very smart, high energy, super affectionate dog and I don\u2019t like to be away from my humans for long. I am so happy when you come home from your errands (or whatever it is that you do when you leave me).  I\u2019ve got a big appetite and I will eat all my food as soon as you put it out for me.  Why, you ask?  Well, because I have a ton of energy! In my mind, I\u2019m still a puppy. I love to run, run, run, both in the house and in the yard (if you don't believe me, watch the video). I definitely need a fenced-in yard, by the way. I love to chase balls, toys, and lizards. \n\nI\u2019m learning my manners right now, because I\u2019m very good with \"sit\" and \"stay\" in the house, but I\u2019m not as obedient outside. I\u2019m learning to walk well on a leash. \n\nIf you would like to adopt me, please reach out to Safe Paws Rescue and we will send you an application to begin the adoption process. Safe Paws is a small rescue, so they accept inquiries from residents in Pinellas County only, please.\n",

            "description": "Gypsy is 6 years old. She is a very special girl who deserves an equally special home. She's very sweet and loves people. She's very easy going and mellow and just likes to hang out with you and be close to you. Gypsy bonds very closely with her people and because of this, she develops separation anxiety. She does not do well in apartment situations and will thrive in a ranch setting with other dogs and someone who is frequently home. She is house trained but does not like to be confined and will be best with a doggy door so she has free range. She is really such a love and has tons of love and companionship to offer.\n\nLocated in Anza, CA\n\nIf interested in ADOPTING, please fill out an adoption application online:\nwww.hoperanchanimalsanctuary.org/adoption-application\n\nA copy of your application can be sent to us via email\n\nFor more information about Gypsy, please contact Kathy:\nCall/Text: (951) 515-4077\nEmail: k.haley.hope.ranch@gmail.com",

            "description": "Henry is a 1-2 year old Hound mix. Henry is loose, wiggly and happy! He likes to give gentle chin nudges and kisses. Like most hounds, Henry is high energy. This guy would need plenty of exercise in his life! He pulls on a leash but with some basic obedience training, this could easily be resolved. Henry is food motivated. Wow! knows the sit and shake command. He is not a fan of cats in a shelter atmosphere. Dogs are generally tested with dogs of their own size; and dog meets with the resident dogs are always encouraged. Our cat test should be used as a general purpose screening only to rule out overt aggression; we always recommend caution when introducing dogs to cats in the home. Recommendation on suitability of placement with children by their ages is based on behavioral observations including energy level and response to body handling. We never recommend leaving young children unsupervised with dogs, and we cannot guarantee the behavior of dogs with children, other pets or cats. Behavior evaluations should be considered as a snapshot of the behavior of the dog at this point in time; JHS believes all dog families need to be prepared to invest time and energy into training as well as provide common sense management of their new dog. We always encourage family to do some research on the breeds or mixes of breeds prior to adoption as many can have some unique characteristics that may or may not fit into their families. Always remember that the majority of dogs at our shelter have been exposed to or may have kennel cough. Kennel cough is contagious to other dogs, please talk to your vet if you have any questions about kennel cough prior to adoption. Please ask your adoption counselor at time of adoption if you have any unanswered questions regarding illnesses and treatments of the path that you are adopting. For more information about this dog or any others at our Shelter, please visit www.joplinhumane.org. We are the Joplin Humane Society in Joplin, Missouri. 417-623-3642 I AM SPONSORED!

She does say no-thank-you to the cats though. Juno's foster has fostered many, many dogs with us over the years, and she says that Juno is one of the best she's ever had! Juno is heartworm positive, but the cost of her treatment is covered if our Rockwall vet is used. She is spayed, microchipped, and current on her vaccinations.

Babe loves to have all the attention on her and NEEDS to be the only animal in the home. Babe walks well on leash and would enjoy short walks and long naps in her new home.

            "description": "Bullet is a 7-month-old mixed breed rescued from a high-kill shelter. This dog is current on vaccinations, microchipped, 4dx/heartworm tested, and neutered. This dog is also tested with other dogs, kennel-trained, and working on housebreaking. We would love for you to meet this dog and see if it might be a good fit for your home. \n\nThe first step to adoption is completing an adoption application on our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org. Pending approval, your application is valid for 1 year, and you will be eligible to request a hold on an individual animal. The hold does not require that you adopt the animal, but ensures you get to meet and make an adoption decision prior to other applicants. Hold times cannot exceed 5 days. Also pending approval, you will be able to acquire foster home contact information, so you inquire on personalities of specific animals.\n\n***COVID-19 Update: While we typically host weekly Saturday adoption events, in order to follow the CDC's recommendation for COVID-19 protocols, we will be suspending our weekly Saturday adoption events until given the clear. Adoptions for individual animals will occur by private adoption appointment and/or adoption handoff. Appointments and handoffs are scheduled pending staff, foster home, and vetting schedules. Because we are 100% foster-based, adoption appointments and handoffs are only offered for individual animals. When adopting at an appointment, please be aware that you will be taking the animal home that day. We can not hold animals to be picked up at a later date.\n\nDue to CDC's recommended COVID-19 protocols, we are highly encouraging foster homes and adopters to speak with one another via phone or video chat to ensure compatible matches and limit in-person contact. If meeting in person, our foster homes are encouraged to wear masks, socially distance, and choose an outdoor meeting spot. Should you want to proceed forward with the adoption, all adoption paperwork, medical records, and adoption fees are to be completed electronically. Quick and low-contact animal handoff is also being encouraged amongst foster homes and adopters. As always, we include a one-week trial period with all our adoptions.\u00a0***\n\nPlease note, we do not have the ability to process adoption applications at our adoption events, so please plan accordingly. If an application is submitted past 5pm on Monday-Thursday, it will begin review the following day. If submitted on Friday-Sunday, it will begin review on Monday. It takes approximately 48-72 hours for an application to be processed.\n\nFor additional questions regarding meeting this dog please contact us via text/email at 970.699.6772, or contact@bounceanimalrescue.org. We apologize for any inconvenience, but due to a high volume of inquiries, calls and voicemails regarding adoption will not be returned.\n\nThank you for choosing adoption! If you would like more information on our organization please visit our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org.",

            "description": "Hello! My name is Ullie. I'm about 4 years old and 65lbs. \n\nEven though I had a hard life in Texas, I am thriving in a CO home with my foster humans and lab mix foster sister now. Im learning words like \"sit\" and \"touch,\" trying to fit on every lap I can find for scratches, and love going for walks and play dates with other pups! I like other pups so much that I tug pretty hard on the leash when I see them and cant say hi, but Im responding really well to training (and cheese) and getting calmer every day. When I actually get to meet and play with dogs, I am super friendly and playful. I especially would love a home with a dog sibling my own size that appreciates my big and jumpy play style, but I would be able to ignore a dog sibling that wants none of that. Im a bit too interested in cats so would prefer a feline free home, and Im not sure how I feel about small children just yet, because Ive yet to meet any!\n\nI dont like to brag but my inside manners are top notch. I haven't had any accidents, besides this one time I got a little confused by a potted plant but dont worry I have that figured out now! I also sleep great in a crate when peanut butter is involved but I am well behaved when left unattended outside of the crate too. Im medium energy so I love being a couch potato, but also would love a decent walk every day or hike once in a while.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this sweet boy please complete an application at https://www.circle2rescue.com/dog-adoption-application/ The adoption fee of $250 includes the spay/neuter, vaccinations, deworming and microchip. \n\nPlease note, Circle 2 Rescue cannot guarantee the breed, composition or ages of our dogs as we usually have no history prior to them entering the rescue. We make every effort to ensure the dogs are healthy.",

He loves playing with other dogs. He has a moderately high energy level, but if you walk him daily and make sure he has chew toys, he enjoys spending a good portion of the day as a couch potato! Joaquin enjoys other higher energy dogs and enjoys a rough and tumble playtime. He gets nervous around men and needs slow intros to them. If Joaquin is around people that understand his need to come to them on his own terms, he will do great. Inside the home, he needed to be reminded of his manners when jumping but he is a dream. When walking, he will pull and is reactive to other dogs, so he will need continued training at his new home. Joaquin is a great snuggle buddy and he is so easy to fall in love with! His perfect furever family would be active each day!\n\nPlease Note: All dogs currently available for adoption are posted on our website. If you cannot find a particular dog on our website, he/she may be on a temporary foster hold. All dogs are otherwise posted until they are officially adopted.

            "description": "Click my picture for more info. on me!\nMeet Abby\n\nAbby is a stunning 4 year old German Shepherd. This devoted girl has been with us for a few months going through heartworm treatment and is now ready to take applications.\n\nAbby loves her people so much that she will need them to be home all day with her! She is a very smart eager to please lady and a major foodie. Abby is able to crate for short periods of time, house trained, knows commands and walks well on leash. While Abby loves having friends to play with she cannot be in a home with any small animals like cats, rabbits, or rodents. She has been working hard meeting other dogs on leash but will need a breed experienced owner that can commit to working on this more with her. Abby also requires a fenced back yard. She is a lovely lady who has brightened up any home she enters!\n\nIf you are interested in her, fill out an application at\nwww.fayettehumane.org/adopt/dogapplication\n\nDue to COVID-19, we are not able to facilitate meet and greets until a family is approved and then only at the foster family's discretion. At this time, we are not holding dog adoptions at Petsmart.\n\n**Applications can take anywhere from 5-7 business days to complete. When filling out an application, please scroll down after submitting it to be sure that the website accepted it and check for a confirmation email to be sure that your application went through. We respond by email, so please check your spam and trash folders.**\n\nWe are located in Fayette County, GA and are a foster based rescue without a shelter building.\n\nEstimated DOB: 10/31/2016\nAdoption fee: $350\n\nCLICK HERE to APPLY TO ADOPT\nor paste the following link in your browser: https://fayettehumane.org/adopt/dogapplication\nFor full details about ADOPTING, please visit our Adoption Guide (https://fayettehumane.org/adoption-information/adoption-guide/).\n\nAll our dogs are tested for heartworms, spayed/neutered, up-to-date on age appropriate vaccines and flea prevention.\n\nCats are tested for FLV/FIV when age appropriate, as kittens tested at an age less than 16 weeks tends to lead to unreliable results. All our cats are spayed/neutered, up-to-date on age appropriate vaccines and flea prevention.",

            "description": "***Thanks to a generous supporter of our rescue, Fozzie's adoption fee is sponsored!***\n\nMeet Fozzie!  This big handsome guy is a 2 year old terrier/mix who weighs in around 80+ lbs or so. Fozzie was adopted from our rescue when he was a puppy and his family adores him.  They reached out to us for help as there has been some major tension between Fozzie and his senior 4 legged sister.  They have worked with their vets and trainers and the conclusion is Fozzie would do best in a home without another dog.  The family is heartbroken over this but they want to make sure both dogs are living their best lives and are each in an environment they can thrive in.  Fozzie will be staying with his family for the time being while we work together to find him the best home.  \n\n****\n\nHis family writes:\n\nHe is the best boy of all the good boys. Fozzie is the BIGGEST cuddle bug, and always needs to be cuddling someone. We\u2019ve spoiled him and he sleeps with my son every night. He has crate anxiety from his rough start as a puppy, so we only put him in a crate if no one is home (he\u2019s mischievous and likes to get into things when no one is around). He loves warm blankets, Kong chew toys, fresh bones from the butcher shop, peanut butter, any cuddles he can get, and any table scraps he can find (he is a counter surfer so if it\u2019s left out on the counter...watch out! ?)\n\nFozzie loves to run and chase tennis balls, loves being on the trampoline, and wants to play with all the kids outside. We have 2 acres fenced in, so if his future family runs in public places he will definitely need lessons on manners while on a leash. He does not like to be outside if everyone is inside, and vice versa he doesn\u2019t like being inside if everyone is outside. He is an amazing family dog. Fozzie is so good with all of our kids (ages 10,8, and 20 months). He is affectionate and loving with all of them, and enjoys cuddling with them on the couch or in bed. He loves to give slobbery kisses, but be forewarned his breath can be awful LOL!  Fozzie absolutely hates the outside hose, so when he gets into mud or dirt we have to throw him in the shower. Personally I think he just is boujee and likes the warm water. ? He won\u2019t fight the bath, but he acts pretty dramatic during the whole event. Kids are no issue either, but he definitely needs space to get his energy out! I would also recommend a family who is ok with him being up on the couch, because he doesn\u2019t know the meaning of personal space! ?\n\n****\n\nFozzie is neutered, microchip, and current on all his vaccines.  He is an amazing boy and would be a great addition to an active, dog and cat free, home!  \n\nApply to adopt Fozzie today!\n\nwww.harleyshavendogrescue.com/adopt",

He's interested in small furries, but he's enough of a gentleman not to pull you down running after them. Like all teenage boys, he's got a lot of energy and needs to bulk up a bit, but he's well on his way to becoming a very handsome and well-behaved companion. He's a perfect \"my first bullie\"!   Patrick's heartworms are currently being treated by rescue.  Complete an application at - www.texasbullterrier.org - if you would like to make Patrick part of your family!Meet Patrick!",

He likes to talk and has a lot to say! Uncle Boomer is perfect in the house and completely trustworthy. He's overweight at around 100 lbs but loves his walks while dieting to loose those extra pounds; his ideal weight will be closer to 80 lbs. He gets along with the other hounds in foster care and is not aggressive or pushy. He would be fine with older children, but due to his size, smaller children would not be ideal. He will softly whine when he can't be with his people but sleeps heavy through the night. Uncle Boomer needs a home where he will be with his family the majority of the time and not left alone all day. Uncle Boomer is waiting in Dallas for his forever family.",

She's a very very good girl who is UTD on shots, spayed, microchipped and has her rabies. Look into those beautiful blue eyes.  Aurora walks well on a leash and does her potty outside. She likes other dogs but would do best as the only pet in the home. Aurora is skiddish of young children who are loud and run through the house so she'd be best with children who are over that stage. She's quiet. Not a barker but will bark or whine if she's gotta get out for potty. She loves her humans. She will make a great family member. She's learning to play and  do what dogs do. Very layed back girl. She keeps her kennel neat and clean. Aurora just wants to 'belong\". She'd love a stable life with a great family to dote on her. She loves going for walks and I laugh at her because she's so alert to even a leaf blowing. Her adoption fee is 300.00 and she is being fostered near Wisconsin Dells and Adams-Friendship. To meet Aurora apply at lastpawrescue.org 501(c) approved. Wisconsin agriculture number 285589-DS",

I'm obsessed with my stuffed toys and love to carry them around with me! I only put them down when I get treats and give hugs, which I love to do! I know my name and am working on other commands, such as fetch, and hopefully I'll know many commands soon. My favorite things to do are cuddle and go on walks, and when I'm on a walk, I love to sniff everything! I leave no stone unturned and no leaf untouched, especially when I'm on nature trails, which are my favorite. This sweet southern gentleman would love to go on a walk with you, so come meet me and see what an amazing dog I am!",

Margo loves people and children but does not do well with other dogs or cats. She\u2019s house trained and is very smart. She does great on a leash, loves car rides and loves her humans. Margo is with a very temporary foster home. She\u2019s in the Topeka area but can meet in KC for any potential approved home. She needs a secure fenced yard as well. She\u2019ll make an excellent family companion as an only dog. Please email me at katiea_knapp@yahoo.com if you\u2019d like more information. Thanks for sharing!",

Taken to the Garland Animal Shelter after being hit by a car, Anna was held for four days in terrible pain while the shelter waited for her owners to claim her. When no one did, we urged them to release her to us so we could save her leg. Unfortunately that wasn't possible and had to be removed.\n\nTrust us here; it has NOT slowed her down in the slightest. Anna never meets a stranger, loves every body she meets and is ready for a walk or playing with another dog, when properly introduced. She's a high energy gal who'll benefit from a nice sized back yard and a playmate equal to her energy level. She's already crate trained and housebroken. She'll not do well crated long hours; e.g. 8 to 10 hours a day, she has way too much energy for that. But she'll make a loving and wonderful companion for any household willing to be her pack leader and focus her energies appropriately.",

They are survivors and are doing great in foster care. Since Luann is just around 5 weeks old she needs to stay with us a little while longer. But as you can see she is ready to get out and explore!\n\nPlease contact Andrea @ andrea@oglalapetproject.org for an adoption application. Adoption fee is $200. Adoption applications are processed by OPP volunteers, since we do not have a shelter facility we check references and meet with you in your home to discuss the pet you are interested in adopting. The adoption fee for all OPP dogs/puppies is $200 which includes vaccinations, dewormer, flea/tick treatment and spay/neuter surgery - and in many cases we've treated the pet for much more if it arrives to OPP ill or injured. Our adoption fee helps cover to cover some of these costs - adopters are welcome to make an additional donation to the program at the time of adoption so we can continue to help other unwanted pets on Pine Ridge.\n\nVisit us on Facebook to learn more about our work facebook.com/OglalaPetProject Thank you for choosing to adopt a rescued animal!",

Since Alder is only about 5 weeks old he needs to stay with us a little while longer, but during the gloom of January is the perfect time to adopt a new baby. He will definitely entertain you!\n\nPlease contact Andrea @ andrea@oglalapetproject.org for an adoption application. Adoption fee is $200. Adoption applications are processed by OPP volunteers, since we do not have a shelter facility we check references and meet with you in your home to discuss the pet you are interested in adopting. The adoption fee for all OPP dogs/puppies is $200 which includes vaccinations, dewormer, flea/tick treatment and spay/neuter surgery - and in many cases we've treated the pet for much more if it arrives to OPP ill or injured. Our adoption fee helps cover to cover some of these costs - adopters are welcome to make an additional donation to the program at the time of adoption so we can continue to help other unwanted pets on Pine Ridge.\n\nVisit us on Facebook to learn more about our work facebook.com/OglalaPetProject Thank you for choosing to adopt a rescued animal!",

These pups are survivors and are doing well but since they are only about 5 weeks they need to stay in foster care a little while longer.  \n\nPlease contact Andrea @ andrea@oglalapetproject.org for an adoption application. Adoption fee is $200. Adoption applications are processed by OPP volunteers, since we do not have a shelter facility we check references and meet with you in your home to discuss the pet you are interested in adopting. The adoption fee for all OPP dogs/puppies is $200 which includes vaccinations, dewormer, flea/tick treatment and spay/neuter surgery - and in many cases we've treated the pet for much more if it arrives to OPP ill or injured. Our adoption fee helps cover to cover some of these costs - adopters are welcome to make an additional donation to the program at the time of adoption so we can continue to help other unwanted pets on Pine Ridge.\n\nVisit us on Facebook to learn more about our work facebook.com/OglalaPetProject Thank you for choosing to adopt a rescued animal!",

Paul and his brothers and sisters were rescued when they were just born. Paul is old enough to start searching for his forever family. Now that his is a little older some Pit Bull features are showing, like the wide head and expressive eyes. Since these pups have been handled since they were tiny, Paul is used to being the center of attention.\n\nPlease contact Andrea @ andrea@oglalapetproject.org for an adoption application. Adoption fee is $200. Adoption applications are processed by OPP volunteers, since we do not have a shelter facility we check references and meet with you in your home to discuss the pet you are interested in adopting. The adoption fee for all OPP dogs/puppies is $200 which includes vaccinations, dewormer, flea/tick treatment and spay/neuter surgery - and in many cases we've treated the pet for much more if it arrives to OPP ill or injured. Our adoption fee helps cover to cover some of these costs - adopters are welcome to make an additional donation to the program at the time of adoption so we can continue to help other unwanted pets on Pine Ridge.\n\nVisit us on Facebook to learn more about our work facebook.com/OglalaPetProject Thank you for choosing to adopt a rescued animal!",

            "description": "I AM ON HOLD FOR AN UPCOMING ADOPTION APPOINTMENT Meet Charlie, a handsome mixed-breed boy who weighs about 51 pounds and who is anxious to find a loving home. Charlie came to us as a stray, but he's one of those dogs who has been happy to spend time with us. Charlie loves when you come to see him, and he's excited to go for walks. He's also a big fan of tug of war! Charlie's adoption fee is $130, but the fee has been paid by Back Roads Pizza through 2/14/21. He is neutered and microchipped and has age-appropriate vaccinations. A licensing/microchip fee may apply. To meet Charlie or to be added to his waitlist, call (505) 983-4309 x 1610 and leave a voicemail message that includes the DOG'S NAME, plus YOUR NAME and A GOOD PHONE NUMBER - OR e-mail this information to adoption@sfhumanesociety.org. A scheduler will call you back within 48 hours to confirm your request. If you have other dogs at home, tell the scheduler this because you should plan to bring them along for a Meet n' Greet. SFAS offers a variety of excellent training classes, seminars and Trainer Talks led by animal behavior professionals. These are $50 off for animals adopted from any shelter or rescue group! Due to current COVID-19 restrictions, classes and talks are all presented virtually using Zoom.

            "description": "Adopt from OPP & save a life... we take unwanted pets from community members on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota.\n\nPrue is 1 of a litter of 6 pups taken in by OPP when they were just born. Now that she is a little older, we see some Pit Bull traits, such as her wide head and expressive eyes. Prue is used to being fussed over so if you have the time, and space on your couch for her, Prue may be the dog for you!\n\nPlease contact Andrea @ andrea@oglalapetproject.org for an adoption application. Adoption fee is $200. Adoption applications are processed by OPP volunteers, since we do not have a shelter facility we check references and meet with you in your home to discuss the pet you are interested in adopting. The adoption fee for all OPP dogs/puppies is $200 which includes vaccinations, dewormer, flea/tick treatment and spay/neuter surgery - and in many cases we've treated the pet for much more if it arrives to OPP ill or injured. Our adoption fee helps cover to cover some of these costs - adopters are welcome to make an additional donation to the program at the time of adoption so we can continue to help other unwanted pets on Pine Ridge.\n\nVisit us on Facebook to learn more about our work facebook.com/OglalaPetProject Thank you for choosing to adopt a rescued animal!",

Submit an application from our website and then make an appointment to meet him.\n\nMonaco is eligible for a foster to adopt. \n\nAge: ~2 years\nWeight: ~70lbs\nHousebroken: Yes\nCrate trained: Takes some time to settle, but overall doing well with his crate-training. \nDog sociability: Leash reactive (barks/lunges/pulls) at other dogs. He is strong and requires a confident handler.\nCat sociability: Not a match\nKids: Friendly with kids!\nIdeal home: Monaco prefers to be a solo pet in a quiet neighborhood. He is not a match for a high-rise/elevator and would prefer a backyard!\n\nMonaco is a big, silky love bug ready to steal your heart. He loves affection and craves cuddles, pets and kisses all day long. He's pretty calm in the home and likes to sunbathe in his favorite sun spots around the home or keep himself occupied with his toys. He's very well trained and his foster reports he even leaves the room when they are eating at the dinner table and doesn't beg. While he enjoys walks, he prefers to walk in quiet/calm areas where he won't encounter a bunch of other dogs. He has really loved his foster's backyard where he can take in all the smells and play. He will benefit from an adopter that will continue to work on training - he has come so far in a short amount of time and we know Monaco will only continue to build more confidence!\n\nMonaco's adoption fee is 300. He is neutered, up to date on core vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative.\n\n***We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications. We ask that you please be patient and someone will be in touch via email within 72 hours. Please do not email us unless you have not received a response in 72 hours. Please only fill out one adoption application. ***",

            "description": "This beautiful girl was just surrendered back to the rescue after nearly 3 years, the family fell on hard times and were unable to afford her minimal health care. Lexi is a 3 years old German Shepherd that needs daily medication for a condition that affects her pancreas. She is such a good sweet girl; she will do best in a home with older children. \n\nShe knows several commands and loves people and other dogs. She is adjusting well in her new foster home. Such a gorgeous girl.\n\nHere was her earlier story:\n\nLooks at this beautiful, happy, lucky, sweet, fun little girl with floppy ears.You would never know what she had been through if we didnt tell you. But we want you to know so you too can appreciate the love and forgiveness of a dog. Anatasia was traumatized at only 4 months old. She was owner surrender to local shelter after being attacked by a dog. We think they may have tried to treat her but it was too expensive so they surrendered her to the local shelter where she had zero chance. She was rescued by Dallas Dogrrr so she could receive immediate vet care for her face; which required dental surgery and many stitches. They had to take a portion of the bottom of her mouth, and her skin was stretched on her top mouth to help heal. So she has an Elvis Presley grin (its pretty adorable); she is doing great now and is such a fighter. We hope we can find her a home that will love her forever and never give up on her.",

He is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4506712.\n\nTo visit with this pup, please make an appointment here: https://mcaccappointments.as.me/adopt. NOTE: People who sign up for these appointments often no-show. We have been told that you can go straight to the shelter and let them know you are there to meet this particular dog. From what we understand, the shelter will squeeze you in except between 12-3PM and near the 6PM closing time. (Please know this is not a guarantee). If the dog is at risk, please ask for a supervisor to meet that particular dog. We hope your adoption process is smooth and full of happiness!\n\nMontgomery was found on the street by a good samaritan and jumped in their car ready to go on his next journey. He was kept overnight and the finder stated he was potty trained and likes people. He is an energetic young boy that wags his tail constantly. He doesn't like his kennel very much and gets nervous when kennel staff or a volunteer comes to take him out of the kennel but once he is out, he is ready to GO!! He jumps up often and pulls on the leash and could definitely benefit from training to learn his manners. He would not do well in a home with small children because he is so energetic.\n\nWhen Montgomery went to the play yard with other dogs, he went off by himself and didn't want to interact with them. When another dog approached him, he ran away from them. He wants to be on his own. When Montgomery was taken for a walk by a volunteer, he had on a cone due to his neuter surgery. The volunteer stated he was very easy to walk due to the cone so that shows he can learn.\n\nIf you think Montgomery would be a good fit in your home, then please bring the family and meet him today!!\n\n*Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG. MCACC is located at 2500 S. 27th Avenue, Phoenix. Different adoption fees/policy may apply. Please visit MCACC's website http://www.maricopa.gov/pets/locations.aspx for hours. You may also wish to call 602-506-7387 (PETS) and provide the animal's A# above to verify is still available.",

Morticia is heart worm positive and will be starting treatment soon. She will not be ready to be adopted until the end of February. Morticia loves other dogs, people and is sweet as ever. She has not had one accident in her fosters home either! Stay tuned for more info and updates on Morticia.",

Additionally, PAWS will cover a training consult with Hi-Line Canine, LLC if Remi's adopter is in our area. Triple Dog Brewing Co. has also graciously offered to sponsor her adoption fee. Please share this post so that we may cast a wide net for Remi. This is what her owner has to say about her:\nRemi- I'm 8.5 yrs old, Born 6/5/2012. My birth mom was a border collie/blue heeler mix and dad was bull terrier.  \nMy lovable traits: I love men and especially  teenage boys teen boys are my favorite  Girls are ok too tho! I take a little bit to warm up sometimes (not normally) and I'm not super keen on strangers without a proper introduction. I've never been around little kids so probably a home without them would be best.  im very smart, loyal, and want to be by your side 24/7. The closer you are and more you touch me, the happier I am! I've been thru lots of training, however my grandpa has been very ill and mom has probably not had the time to keep me as brushed up on skills as I should be! Im really good on and off the leash, a great car rider/traveler. It's one of my favs! I also really love to go on a hike! \nThe not so good traits: I absolutely do NOT tolerate other dogs.   My mom and dad who have had me since slightly shy of 4 weeks ( I was taken from my fur mommy way to young and my humans rescued me)  have worked really hard and I just won't give. I keep hurting my sisters to the point of vet visits.  I tolerate the cat however mom isnt sure I would if he were the only one around for me to \"pick on\".\nAlso, I was bit by a rattlesnale in 5/2018, which made me even more cranky than I was before. I have some tummy issues now and I require a more  sensitive tummy dog food. I've been eating lamb and rice from Sam's  Club  and doing pretty well, however i still have periods where i don't eat very well and I have some bouts of colitis. Not fun but after a couple days I am usually good to go again. \nI'm spayed and up to date on all my vaccinations. A fenced yard is a must for me. \n",

            "description": "Life on the streets wasn't real kind to to this sweet boy. He suffered a gash in his upper lip area that extends up to the nostril. But in spite of all he's endured, Clyfe is quiet, affectionate and appreciative of his human(s). Clyfe isn't trusting of other canines, and therefore he doesn't want to share his humans with them, so needs to be the only dog in his household. His big, soulful brown eyes seem to see all the way into your heart, and it's obvious that Clyfe has endured a lot in his 6 years and would so appreciate a kind, loving home.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nDogs in our foster care program are:\n\nspayed/neutered\n\nmicrochipped\n\nup to date on all vaccinations\n\nnegative for heartworms and on regular heartworm preventative OR recently treated for heartworms and on regular heartworm preventative (It can take up to 6 months for a dog to test negative for heartworm after treatments. We will provide you all the medical documentation regarding the pet's treatment.)\n\nNOT IN A SHELTER FACILITY. They are in loving foster care homes where they have received training and socialization to help them fit into your home more quickly. Therefore we schedule appointments in advance and do not have a general facility where you can view multiple dogs at one time.\n\nNote about Breeds:\n\nWe do NOT do DNA tests on the dogs in our program. Many are found as puppies or young adults and we do not have any information about their parents. We select dog breed mixes based on recommendation from shelter staff and/or veterinarians and our experience in working with thousands of dogs. We consider the physical and behavioral traits of the dog as well as their size. If you are looking for a purebred dog and want to argue with us about breed standards, we encourage you to work with breed specific rescue organizations. If you are looking for a dog who have great personalities despite a mixed background (like most of us humans!), we'd love to work with you!\n\nThere are a few steps to set up the adoption.\n\nComplete the\nAdoption Application\nonline. Many dogs receive multiple applications and we review applications in the order they are received.\n\nFoster will review your application and reach out to you to schedule a \"virtual meet and greet\".\n\nParticipate in a \"virtual meet and greet\".\nThis is a great way for you to get to see the dog in a setting where it is already comfortable and get lots of questions answered to determine if the dog's personality and energy level are a good fit.\nThis is also a great time to have a virtual \"home visit\" to show the fence, home, etc to minimize the amount of time the foster would need to come into your home later.\n\nThe foster and adoption coordinator will review the applications and notes from the virtual meet and greets and set up in person home visits with the applicants we feel are the best match for the dog's personality and energy level.\n\nTrial Adoption -dogs are eligible for a trial adoption with the adopter that we feel is the best match. Trial adoptions last up to 3 nights and the foster will provide 3 days worth of food, information about the dog's schedule, and other tips and tricks to make it a successful transition. The adopt fee can be paid online as a deposit to start the trial adoption. If the dog is not the right fit, we refund the adoption fee.\n\nAs a 100% volunteer-powered organization, we appreciate your patience as we review the applications.",

I was heartworm positive, but only adults no microfilaria and am on monthly heartworm preventative, (the only think deadly about heartworms if nothing is done).\nI am housebroken and crate trained... . My adoption fee is $250.00.\n\nI have a unique look ...my tail is shorter than most due to the fact that my mom chewed my tail off as a pup. Why?? Who knows...but someone was obviously not paying attention to mom and pups. \n\nI am the alpha and bond with my people...I will get used to another dog in the house, but am very dominate and bossy with that dog. Therefore.. I will be the Alpha dog and this can cause issues and my person can do nothing about that. Dogs establish their own pecking order and it just is the way it is.  I am also super smart, I know how to open doors, so my family should be prepared for my intelligence, hence the reason a seasoned, experienced Shepherd family is the be match for all me. My last parent said I could open doors..so please consider this. \n\nI love to run, so will need regular exercise. I also need a 6 ft+ wooden fence as I am able to climb a chain link. Shepherds are high shedders ...12 months a year..so some maintenance on your part will be required. There are a lot of good de-shedding shampoos and there is also a new food out that cuts down on the shedding and dander.\n\nThere is an application process and a home visit WILL be required. Your location is not an issue, we can get the home visit done.\n\nWHEN ADOPTING A PET, KEEP IN MIND IT CAN BE A 15++ YEAR COMMITTMENT. PLEASE ADOPT RESPONSIBLY!!",

            "description": "Bella Diamond really is a rare gem! This adorable sweetie is on the lookout for her new family. Being a pup, Bella Diamond would love to find a family to help her with basic manners and training. Bella can be a bit dominant when meeting other dogs and will likely need a submissive canine friend. She ran away from cats when introduced, but there may be a possibility of her being a kitty chaser once she is in a home. She would likely need a very slow introduction to cats or none in the home. Bella has lived with children in her previous home and reportedly did well. Due to her energy and excitement, we think she'd be best in a home with older kids. \n\nIf you're interested in meeting or adopting Bella Diamond, please complete an application at: inapl.org/adoption-application. Once it's processed, a member of our team will be in touch with you to schedule a meet and greet appointment. This is the time when you and all members of your household will come to our shelter to officially make your connection with Bella Diamond.\n\nBella Diamond\nPit Bull Terrier mix\nFemale\nDOB: 3/16/2020\nWeight: 36.6 lbs.\nHeartworm Negative",

She was found in the woods with a group of strays and she has warmed up to our staff a great deal since her mid December arrival. She has taken to their special lovin\u2019s.  You've come a LONG way, baby girl! Give her some time, and she will be the light in your eyes.\n\nShe is an easy girl to have around, and we think she proved her patience with the photographers (burying her under a mound of soft toys, while enjoying a sunbath). That is why we think she will make a great family dog. \n\nAmber\u2019s Jan 16, 2021 video: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/1902156960029671/videos/319029366101217\n\nHer 12/15/20 video:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/1902156960029671/videos/730948774192165\n\nRandolph County Animal Shelter, Wedowee, AL 36278 (256) 357-0101 www.RandolphShelter.org",

Stitch is loyal and likes to be with his person full time. Stitch loves to play all day with toys and other dogs! He has an extremely strong prey drive and needs a job with LOTS and LOTS of activity and exercise. Stitch needs an extremely active family who will give this boy an outlet for his energy. Because of his energy level and playful personality, a family with another ACTIVE and younger dog would be best for him. T he ideal place for him would be a farm or rural area, with lots of space, a job and/or other dogs to play with, and little traffic to chase vehicles. He's not an apartment dwelling dog and also not one to be left all day crated. Stitch is partially deaf but can hear high whistles and low engine rumbles. H e knows some hand signals, including sit and come. He is crate trained and will stay in his crate at night or during the day when unattended. He can bark a little bit when left alone, but he calms down quickly. Because he can easily be distracted, he needs a safe place from vehicles. Stitch requires a home with a fenced in yard. He is house trained, crate trained, neutered, and up to date on vaccines.",

I think I am a lap dog because, well, aren\u2019t I?! I love to snuggle and give hugs, and follow you through the house. I am doing really well with my potty training, and know how to use a dog door. I am also crate trained. I love to be active! I could be the perfect hiking partner if you\u2019ll have me. I am learning how to walk like a gentleman on a leash.\nAlthough I was raised with cats and children from the time I was just a little pup, I do forget my size and strength sometimes and can overwhelm the little beings. My littlest foster brother is working on slow and calm movements because my puppy brain is super reactive to fast and loud things, and my foster mom is teaching me my manners and how to stay calm when those sneaky kittens dart across the floor. I am very food motivated. With continued training, I might do really well in a house with smaller children and cats, but my foster mom says it might be in my best interest if my kids were older and my cats were older and dog smart, or if there just were no cats. I do really well with other dogs and will prefer a family that has another big dog for me to play with.\nMy foster mom wants you to know that I am extremely adorable, but I will be HUGE. I am only 4.5 months old and already almost as big as my boxer sister at 46lbs. Please take my size into consideration when making the decision to bring me into your family.**\n\nPlease see Paws Rescue a message if you are interested.\n",

She grew up in a forest, and is becoming socialized with regular human contact, now at RCAS.  She wants to trust, and it will take a patient calm person to bring out the love she has to offer.  She will be the best friend you ever had, because you saved her from a lonely existence.  Give her some time and you will have a loyal partner for walks and cuddles. \n\nSierra\u2019s video:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/1902156960029671/videos/220431799523250\n\nRandolph County Animal Shelter, Wedowee, AL 36278 (256) 357-0101 www.RandolphShelter.org\n",

This young lady is full of energy and would commit herself to being the best running partner there is.  Koa is very smart and picks up quickly to training with consistency.  She is quite active and will need an equally active family to keep her mind and body relaxed.  She loves food and high valued treats so much that sometimes she gets a little too protective over them.  We have noticed that Koa prefers women over men, so we are looking for a mostly female household... she just wants to be one of the girls!  Koa has been working on her loose leash walking skills and has been improving.  On a day trip to a volunteer's home, she was a wonderful house guest.  She will need to be the only dog in the home.  All this young lady wants is a family and a life full of adventure! She would strongly prefer a home with a backyard to romp around in!",

This is a miracle boy, we pulled him from the euthanasia room, needle in paw, and we are sooooooooo happy that we were able to save this exceptional happy, wiggly pup.\n\nJack is very sweet and cuddly who likes other dogs, as long as they don't challenge him. He LOVES kids, we mean he would be the perfect nanny, he is not such a fan of cats or farm animals. His ideal home would be active, would best as an only dog, but could possibly live with a low energy, submissive female dog.\n\nJack was a stray from the street and when we got him he was lacking manners, so he went into intensive boot camp training to make him ready for his new family. He has been a superstar at training camp, we are talking Brady level superstar.\n\nHe has spent the last month with a trainer and he is doing so well and is definitely a country dog, except for ponies, he does not like ponies...Jack has mastered the art of relaxation, playing with other pups, walking well on a leash, snuggling, and has learned to live life off the streets. We are hoping to find him a home that is in the suburbs, no small animals, no ponies, no cats, but bring on the dogs, he loves dogs, playing, romping, roughhousing, but knows when to stop. \n\nJack has come so far and is ready for us to find him the best home ever. A meet and greet with him and our trainer will be required. We cannot wait for you to meet this incredible boy, you will fall in love in an instant as we all have.",

You just got hit with the Ming stickotherwise known as the OMG, so stinking adorable you might pass out stick.\nCan we just say 1/2 Fireball 1/2 Comedian all wrapped up in an adorable cuddle bug?\nSeriously, folks, we're not joking here!\nHe will keep you laughing with all his silly, playful antics.\nMing is a most adorable young pittie mix who is about 2 years old if that and weighs around 50 lbs making him a bit of an itty pittie.\nThat being said, he could use a few more as he is very lean and needs to pack on a few. Best way to describe him is that Ming is everything a human teenager is not. He is friendly, outgoing, loves to see and engage with anything on two or four legs, will never roll his eyes at you, and will always think you are the best thing since sliced breadand can't we all use a little bit of that adoration?! Ming is a good boy who is learning so many things at the farm and showing himself a grade A student. Ming is eager to please and treat motivated. He knows \"sit\" and \"stay\" with the help of a treat, does well on walks, has excellent potty habits, and is crate trained.\nHe is eager to learn and show his smarts too so training will just become a fun game he plays with everyone to show how smart he really is.\n\nHe would love an active family and would likely do quite well with playmates, he loves the ladies, in particular, that like to romp and roll as much as he does but would seriously be fine being an only dude. He equally loves to cuddle up with his humans and is great with older kids.\nMing is just too much cuteness so someone best come pick him before our hearts explode!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

She would prefer to be the only pup in the home though because other pups are scary to her and likes to keep a safe distance from them. That doesn't stop her from loving adventures like walks in the park, hikes and trips around town so she can get all the love and attention for the human friends she hasn't met yet! Mama also walks nicely on leash and takes treats ever so gently making her a great companion for these adventures! Come spend some time with Big Mama today if sounds like the pup or you!\n\nI am currently in foster!

            "description": "Dear Santa Paws,\n\nIt's me, Shirley, and I'm not a baby anymore! Do you remember me from last Christmas? I was only 3 months old then! But now that I'm a big girl, and I know how to write, I thought I would send you a letter to let you know what a crazy year it's been! You'll never believe this, but over the summer, I went on a wild adventure. Remember how I was living in Tennessee? Well some nice people put me on a big huge van, and now I live in New York! So please make sure when you bring me my presents, you come to the right house, okay?\n\nI have been SUCH a good girl this year, you don't even know! I don't make a peep in the night so that my foster family can get lots of sleep! I know not to go potty in the house anymore, like when I was a puppy, because that would make my hoomans very sad. I am sweet, kind, and gentle with everybody - I just LOVE PEOPLE - and I have been super generous with my kisses, snuggles, and tail wags all year long. Also, have you been watching me playing with my doggy friends? Haven't I been amazing? I'm still your happiest, silliest, clumsiest girl! But hey, what do you expect with such long limbs and floppy ears like mine? OH! Another thing! I always notice when stuff is left out and about, and I sniff those stuffs with my awesome hound nose just to check them out, and yes, I get excited about those stuffs, but I ONLY sniff them, Santa, I swear, I NEVER chew on the stuffs because I know I shouldn't! And you know what? That is REALLY hard because I'm a dog, and I want to chew on all the things! But I don't, see? What did I tell you? I have been the very best girl there ever was!\n\nI know this might be a lot to ask, but the only thing I REALLY want this year, Santa, is a family of my own. Since you have magic Christmas spirit power, is this something you think you could do? If you can, here is my wish list: a big or bigger-than-me doggy sibling who will play outside with me for hours and hours, maybe some hooman kids who will play fetch and run around the yard with me, and people who will snuggle me forever on the couch and give me LOTS of pets and kisses, and will be patient and kind with me. Oh, and a family who is home a lot! Is that possible? I know I'm a year old now, and this is kind of embarrassing, Santa, but I'm still scared of so many things, and I don't want to be left home alone all day. I hope you understand, and that maybe you might have the perfect family in mind for me? Please? Also, do families fit down the chimney? Do you stuff them down one at a time? How does it work? Well, I know you'll figure it out, Santa! I believe in you!\n\nWoofs and kisses,\nYour favorite girl, Shirley\n\nApply to meet Shirley \nOperationfreedomride.com/dog\n**MUST BE ADOPTED TO A HOME WITH ANOTHER DOG**",

My adoption fee is $250.00\n\nAnd just what is my story??\n\nSame story rescuers hear a lot. A young man thought he had to have me, after all I am a beauty and then when he was no longer able to care for me or just didn't want to care for me ...a family member took me in. I am in foster care with them until I can find my forever home.\n\nI am crate trained, housebroken, but of course for that to take place someone has to be paying attention. I love children and there is a larger do at my foster home and we dog well together. I am not sure how I would do with smaller dogs or cats. \n\nI need a home that has had experience with my breed. Husky's can have quirks..they can be escape artist and being Husky/Shepherd mix there will be a dog a day all over you house...SHEDDING all the time(year round)...regular grooming on your part is a must...\n\nThere is an application process and a home visit is required. \n\nCONSIDER WHEN ADOPTING A PET, IT CAN BE A 15++ YEAR COMMITMENT. PLEASE ADOPT RESPONSIBLY!!!!!\n",

Sadie has had a hard life, and has some residual injuries and limps because of them - as a result she can be slow to trust people. We have been fostering Sadie for just over a month, it took about a week for her to warm up and feel comfortable, and she is now content snuggling on the couch with us.\n\nSadie is 5 1/2 years old, weighs 40 lbs and is crated trained and housebroken. She walks nicely on a leash and knows sit and stay and other basic commands. Sadie has all her shots, is spayed and microchipped.\n\nShe would do best in a household with no young children. Sadie gets along with our dogs and likes to run and play with them.\n\nInterested in meeting Sadie? Please complete an adoption application at epicanimalrescue.org and her foster mom will be in touch.",

This lovable weirdo is a 8mo Shepard mix and has been the life of the party since arriving at his foster home. This boy just wants to be loved and is always looking for ways to prove he\u2019s a good boy. He will have you belly laughing at his puppy antics and quirky personality! And if you\u2019re looking for a running buddy? Takola's your boy! \u00a0He is doing an awesome job going on 3-4 mile runs!\n\nTakola is completely house broken and mostly crate trained. Overnight he\u2019s been doing great sleeping in his crate, and even likes to sleep in past his humans some mornings. He does still need a bit of reinforcement that he\u2019s going to be okay when his humans leave and that they will always return to give him more love, but with time, this smart boy will learn this as well. With his high energy breed, he does need to go to a home with a fenced in yard for him to run and get out some of his energy. Takola loves playing with other playful fast dogs and enjoys meeting new dogs. \u00a0A playful dog friend is a prefect match thus he is a wonderful 2nd playful dog! \u00a0Takola needs to go to a home with another dog to help him be ok when alone. \u00a0 This boy is so intelligent and wants to please- training and obedience class will be so fun with him! \u00a0He will learn your routine quickly and adapt accordingly. In the short time he has been here, he has already learned sit, stay, and \u201con-by\u201d while out on runs.\n\nTakola does great with new people and older kids, but does need a reminder \u00a0that not everybody wants to get a hug from him right away. He loves to meet other new pups though and will have you giggling as he romps around with an ear to ear smile on his face!\u00a0\u00a0While another dog is not a requirement for this boy, it could help him adjust a little easier and would provide a nice buddy for him to play and run off his energy with. He is also good with cats. He may chase here and there if they take off, but if he catches up to them, you\u2019ll just find him tilting his head and trying to make friends. As with any high energy breed, he may be a little active at first, but a little training and loving reassurance will have him snuggled on the couch with you in no time.\n\nTakola \u00a0just wants to be loved and have fun. \u00a0If you are looking for an active adventure buddy and a dog who will make you laugh and love- Takola is your guy!\nIf you would like to meet Takola, please visit spotslaststop.org and fill out an application.",

            "description": "Loving, playful & affectionate, everyone meet our #Queen #WiggleButt Ms. #Nala. She's 4 years old, 55lbs, and an American Staffordshire Terrier mix. At the end of the day, Nala is honestly just the biggest lover that you'll ever meet. Nala craves human companionship, loves her daily walks, enjoys sunbathing in the backyard, lives for belly rubs, she's all about cuddles & movie nights & loves to give big kisses. She's 100% potty trained, 100% crate trained and does well on a leash.  Nala knows all of her basic commands and is very eager to please. The perfect family for Nala would be one that is active, loves the outdoors, an avid runner or someone who loves going on daily walks, and definitely a family that loves cuddles & puppy kisses.\n\nWhen it comes to people, Nala loves everyone she meets! She loves & adores children and would make the perfect family pet. She'd do best in a home with kids over 10 years of age because at times she doesn't always understand her strength. Nala would thrive best as the only dog in her furever home, although she has made a few friends while in our care. Nala does not do well with female dogs,  but does well with submissive male dogs with a proper introduction. But once again, we would like her to be the only dog in her forever home. Nala absolutely adores the cat that is currently in her foster home- especially when it comes to cuddle time.\n\nAdoption Requirements: No Exceptions\n- Fenced in Yard Required\n- Needs to be the ONLY DOG in her new home\n- Nala would thrive best as the only dog in the home, but does do well with most submissive male dogs & does great with the male cat in her current foster home\n\nWant To See More Pics:\nhttps://www.petfinder.com/dog/nala-50060051/mi/ferndale/pro-pet-otic-foundation-mi1050/\n\nNala is currently up for adoption through Lending A Helping Paw Dog Rescue located in Metro Detroit. Her adoption fee is $150  & will include her distemper, rabies, bordetella, parvo, & lepto vaccines; deworming; microchip; heartworm test; fecal test & being fixed. Nala is currently on both flea & tick prevention and has had her ProHeart 6 Injection for heartworm prevention. \n\n***PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE POST & FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS****\n\nLending A Helping Paw Dog Rescue; previously known as the PRO-PET-OTIC Foundation, is a 100% Foster-Based Rescue that is ran by all Volunteers. Which means that we are not a shelter & each animal is in an actual home with a foster family. We kindly ask that you put any questions within the email & our team of Volunteers will get back to you. With the overwhelming amount of emails please be patient with our 100% volunteer family and we will get back to you. The application MUST BE filled out, a Vet Check MUST BE completed by our team, as well as a phone interview before we do a 'Meet N Greet.'\n \nHow To Apply:\nIf you're interested in adopting one of our available dogs:\n1. Email LendingaHelpingPaw313@gmail.com with the dogs name as the subject when you ask for the adoption application.\n2. Once you have completed the application, please print it out, fill it out, scan it, & then email it back to LendingAHelpingPaw313@gmail.com. If you do not have a scanner, please take a picture with your phone and we kindly ask that you sent all attachments into one email.\n3. Please make sure to call your vet to grant our organization permission to do a vet check on your current pet.\n4. If you are interested in more than one dog, please list your top 3 choices on the completed application.\n5. Please be honest & truthful on your application. We always do a vet Check. We always do a home visit. And we always have both the prospective families & dogs best interest at heart!\n\nThank you in advance for all of your love & support,\nThe Lending A Helping Paw Dog Rescue Family",

            "description": "Delilah came to us from Pinellas County Animal Services, where she had spent several months recovering from some head and torso wounds. Delilah quickly became a staff favorite at the shelter and won the hearts of many when she smiled! You see, we all think that Delilah was used for fighting (as a \"bait\" dog)-not because she wanted to fight, but because she is so sweet. Delilah was picked up as a stray with many puncture wounds across her face and torso. Her fur has grown in white where her scars used to be. Delilah was at first, frightened of female doggies, and was also a bit uncertain of the male ones too. She has since warmed up to most male dogs and will play with them in a rough and tumble, but nice way. She will also now walk past a female dog without incident, and is learning many new commands and tricks! Delilah spends time lying around in the sun on the sand, chasing tennis balls, and tossing around her favorite rope toys. She takes treats gently and has nice leash manners as well. Delilah still has a lot of \"puppy energy\" and likes to chew. She is learning not to use her mouth to get attention, but rather to sit patiently and wait for a treat. If you fell in love with Delilah's sweet face, heard her sad story, and have the heart and the patience to continue with her training, please visit our online application to meet sweet Delilah!",

I have bounced between 4 homes; life has been so hard. Due to this instability, I have developed some inappropriate behaviors, such as nipping at new people's feet when I get too excited. I have been experiencing some severe separation anxiety here at the shelter, but I'm hoping that will go away when I find a loving home that can provide the structure I desire. I think I am a one-owner kind of gal. I get very attached to my people, and I want to be the most important thing in their lives!! I will require an adopter who is experienced in owning pups like me who could use some behavior modification help! I do best when I'm kept occupied. Exercise and games are the best! I loooove chasing balls in the yard or hanging out on the couch gnawing on a good chew toy. Having some rules and boundaries would help too. I just want to be a productive member of society! I can be a little fearful when meeting new people, so I would appreciate if you toss me treats from a distance and let me approach you on my own terms. I have played in doggie play groups, but I can be a bit too much sometimes, so I would do best in a home as the only dog. In my forever home, I could do without kids. But as long as they are old enough to understand my needs, then I'm sure we can make it work! If you think my smooshy face is super cute, you should come meet me at Stray Haven!! We can see if we would be a good match!\nStray Haven Humane Society & SPCA\n194 Shepard Rd., Waverly, NY 14892\n(607) 565-2859, www.strayhavenspca.org \nOpen hours (winter): Tues, Wed & Thurs Noon - 6pm; Sat 10am-4pm",

            "description": "Aurora is a 1 year old Boxer mix weighing 55 pounds. She came to us as a stray so her history is unknown. Aurora is anything but sleeping beauty! While this girl is very pretty, she is VERY high energy! She is full of boxer puppy energy and would benefit from a very active home to work out that energy and build her confidence. She is very sweet and loves attention, she gives the best kisses in exchange for belly rubs. Her favorite things are squeaky toys and peanut butter! She knows commands sit and shake. She absolutely loves walks but needs a lot of work on a leash and her manners. She is a jumper so a family with no small children is required. She will benefit from training classes. She's extremely treat motivated but can be distracted easily. She also thinks she is a lap dog!\n\nHer adoption fee is $250, this includes her spay, heartworm test, vaccines current, deworming, heartworm/flea prevention and micro chipped. Her dog license is also required to be purchased for Sandusky County residents at time of adoption, which is an additional $20.75. \n\nPlease visit the shelter to meet her, we show dogs Monday through Friday 1-4:30pm and Saturday 1-3:30pm. Please note, we do not offer same day adoptions.Come and meet your new best friend today! The Humane Society of Sandusky County is open Monday -Friday 1pm - 5pm and Saturdays from 1pm - 4pm. Also, be sure to check us out on FaceBook!",

            "description": "Zara is a spayed young Staffy/Boxer mix. She is about 2-3 years old. She is the mother of Jesse, Cary, and Randy.\n\nHere's what her foster mom has to say about her!\n\n\"\"Zara is doing good. She's a 50-pound super ENERGETIC puppy pretty much! She wants to play all the time and loves nothing more than her toys! She seems to be adjusting better with our dog as well. There haven't been any snapping incidents since that first week, but we are also very diligent about watching her with treats and bones and toys so both dogs have their space. She probably should have some basic obedience training, because she's got that like bully breed in her and can be stubborn. It will also teach her not to jump up or at people. She does know sit and down, and will do so with treats, but you have to be very firm with her. Playtime is her favorite time, as she loves to play tug of war and often will have multiple toys in her mouth. She's definitely got a great personality about her and loves to give doggie kisses while sitting on your lap.\n\nWe are working on leash training, and that will just take some time. Walks are fun and very good for her since she's got tons of energy! She sniffs the ground the whole time. She might do great as a running partner, but we have to get her trained to walk nicely on a leash first. She is unsure of new people and new environments and will bark at people she doesn't know, but the people we've had come over she's been okay with as long as she sees them enter the house. We've also gotten her used to being in the crate during the day and at night. She should do great with older kids, like pre-teen and up, since they can play with her all the time, but younger kids might accidentally get knocked over. She does okay with our cats, but will chase after them if they run.\"\"\n\n1-20-21 Update: \"\"She's been doing fine, lots of kisses and tail wagging and tug of war! We are still working on getting her used to walking on a leash (with and without a harness). She needs some more confidence since everything is \"\"new\"\" to her, but she's learning, and definitely a lover and a very sweet puppy.\"\"\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Zara, please fill out an application on our website: https://us01.sheltermanager.com/service?account=ah0334&method=online_form_html&formid=5To complete an adoption application, go to: http://almosthomeanimals.org/applications/adoption/",

When they found me, I had no hair on most of my body. You would never know that I had a ruff start to life because I'm such a friendly girl.\n\nSince then, I've been enjoying the good life at my foster home and now my beautiful red coat is growing back! I'm housetrained, not destructive indoors, and people friendly - I have liked every stranger I've met (they aren't strangers to me! Just more people who can give me some lovin' ). I love playing with squeaky toys, snuggling on the couch and sunbathing outside. My name may be Bella Sue but it should've been Dora the Explorer because I love going on adventures. Every time my foster mom grabs my leash to go on a walk, I do a happy dance.\n\nWon't you come meet me? I promise you won't regret it. You'll fall in love with my affectionate personality and adorably wrinkly forehead. I cannot wait to find my fur-ever home soon!\n\n________________________________________________\n\n\nMy adoption fee is $200. This includes a spay/neuter, up-to-date vaccines, deworming, a microchip, a heartworm test, and, if needed, heartworm treatment.\n\n________________________________________________\n\nFor all animals that have not been spayed or neutered a $100 deposit will be required in addition to the adoption fee. The deposit is refundable upon completion of the spay / neuter surgery.\n\nFor more information email: adopt@animalrescueneworleans.org.\n\nTo complete an application, please visit: https://animalrescueneworleans.org/adoptfoster/.\n\nPlease visit our facebook for more information about adoption specials, and adoption events. Events are a great way to meet multiple animals at a time!",

He likes to jump fences...he will need to be in a home with at least a 6' wooden fence that he can't get a foothold on to get over. He is currently having weekly visits with a volunteer trainer, assisting him with controlling he over zeallous energy when he meets people that he likes. He has progressed in improving his need to jump fences, but it has taken time for him to 'get to know' his space, routine, and expectations. We suspect that once he is in a new home, TIME, CONSISTENCY, and PATIENCE will pay off and help this boy overcome his desire to see what is on the other side. As we said, he's a great boy, affectionate, playful, and exuberant, and with a little bit of work, he's going to be a fantastic companion to a family for the rest of his life! Come meet this boy!",

I would love a home with another larger, confident, and playful dog that would play with me, I'm only about a yaer old after all.... AND a human that is more athletic, willing to take me on a run, a bike ride, or several walks. Besides being a bit of a wildcard, I do have a few Aces up my sleeve, such as how fun I am, how cuddly I can be when we settle in for the night, and that I've got some pretty decent obedience under my paws, (although I pull like a freight train when we first head out on a walk). So, if you are a pretty acitve person, (without cats in the home... not a fan)... have another young, high energy dog (preferably male), and are looking for a little more excitement in your life, we should DEFINITELY meet. I could be your Lady Luck, and you could be my Sugar Daddy!",

            "description": "Meet BB, the most resilient and happy dog you will ever meet. Her heart warms up to every human and dog instantly and she just loves hearing her name. Her tail will wag the second she hears your voice and will come to you and stay by your side. She loves getting pets, cuddles, and attention so much so, that her eyes will close in absolute bliss when you pet and cuddle her. She loves putting her head on your leg or chest just to be near you. You can truly feel the love and appreciation she has to give every day. BB needs a home that has calm animals since she is partially blind. She needs someone who will be dedicated to her health improvement, which includes a strict diet, and a little bit of exercise. She is okay in a crate but has no anxiety if left alone. She will just wait by the door until you come back. She is a champ taking her insulin shot in the morning and will gobble up any food you give her. BB is a bundle of joy and love and you cannot help but be inspired by her positivity. She makes you feel so loved and appreciated and would be the perfect addition to any home. In a nutshell, BB is SWEET; HAPPY; LOVING; CUDDLY; CALM; QUIET; HUNGRY; PATIENT; RESILIENT. This pet is available for pre-adoption and may not be officially ready for adoption, as it is still undergoing medical treatment. Depending on the medical status, a Meet and Greet may be put on hold until they can safely participate in a meeting with potential adopters. In some cases, this pet may be able to move to its forever home while it is still under the medical care of Dallas Pets Alive. If you are interested in learning more, apply now and one of our Adoption Counselors will discuss the options available so you can bring home your new furry family member! Applications are processed in the order in which they are received; please be aware that this pet may have interested applicants ahead of you. All Dallas Pets Alive adoptable pets are spayed or neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines upon adoption. The standard minimum donation for dogs over six months to seven years is $200, puppies under six months is $250, dogs eight years and over are $100 unless specified otherwise. You can view all adoptable pets and fill out an adoption application online on our website at http://dallaspetsalive.org/adopt/adoptable-dogs/ . For more information, you can email adopt@dallaspetsalive.org.",

            "description": "Hi, there. I'm Puddin. My former owners left me behind when they moved, but that's ok because now I'm a K9 Angel. My foster mom loves that I'm so easygoing. I really, really enjoy snuggling with my humans. When you need your space, I'll happily snore the day away in a comfy spot or entertain myself with some toys. I also enjoy spending time outdoors and going for walks. I have a big, furry foster brother who's ok too. He's fun to wrestle with. I'm such a good girl that foster mom leaves me loose in the house when she's gone or goes to bed, which is awesome because I really hate being crated. I have had zero accidents in the house and I do not chew on things that are not mine.\n\nIf you're looking for a more mature, easygoing pup, then I'm your girl! Fill out that application so you can come meet me. I'll gladly accept all the love and cuddles you're willing to provide.\n\nPuddin is a 5 year old female Bulldog mix who weighs 60lbs.",

He is neutered and now current on all vaccinations and microchipped.  He has done well with housetraining but was rehomed to a relatives home and began marking.  They are not sure why he started marking, but could have been the new surroundings and claiming new territory?  Whatever the circumstance, he is smart and easily trained.  He is being rehomed because they have a new baby and they are unable to have enough time for four dogs.  The dogs require more exercise and attention than they are currently receiving.\n\nThe adoption fee for \"Cash\" is $200 and he would do best in an active family.  He is two years old and a perfect age for transitioning.  We do not adopt to families with children under the age of 5 and prefer to find homes within a 200 mile radius as we have a two week trial period before adoptions are final and we also have booster vaccinations that have followup boosters 30 days later.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting \"Cash\" email kathy@3dogrescue.com for an application that can be filled out online and returned.",

            "description": "\n\nHere's a great update on how Bailee is doing in her foster home (and those new photos - do you not LOVE the big smile on her face now?): \n\"She is learning the stairs [to yard] really well. Maybe not all the spacial areas quite as fast, but she is picking up on going down and coming back up all on her own. She is highly food motivated and there is no issue with reaching into her dish or taking away a bone.  Bowels seem consistent, and no issues holding it to go outside.  Doesn't mind being touched, and settles down in front of the fire on a dog bed.  She is doing just fine with her crate, and doesn't complain much ever about anything. **Someone needs to cherish this sweet girl for the rest of her days.**\"\n\nAnd, dear reader, that's where you step in. Bailee is still in need of a home of her own. Is that you?  Here's a little more history on this sweet old girl:\n\nDue to some major life changes in the family, including young children who are allergic, senior girl Bailee is in need of a new home ASAP. \n\nBailee is a 10 yo spayed female who is also blind. She lost her sight several years ago due to unknown causes - the owner says she is 100% blind. She has lived with other dogs, but since her sight loss became more irritable and aggressive with a Labrador she lived with for years. We are told she is not good with small dogs and her owner feels she would be best in a home with no other animals and no small children. \n\nShe is very friendly with new people and would do well with someone who has a little extra time for her. Because dogs orient so well through their nose/scent, sight loss is usually very manageable. \n\nApply to adopt here: https://forms.spdrdogs.org/adoptions/\n\nTransport to Western Washington can be arranged. A backup foster home would also be very helpful for February. Please Message us for a foster home application. \n\nWashington, Oregon, or Idaho only - no multi-state transports\n\nPlease visit our Facebook page for updates: https://www.facebook.com/SPDRRottweilerRescue",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Charlie Brown- Because look at my big block head!!!!. I'm a big 'ol American Bulldog & my foster momma says the \"bull\" part of that is right. She says I am totally bullheaded & I ignore her when she's talking.... did someone say something??? She also said I'm like a bull in a china shop. Excuse me but sometimes stuff gets in my way & it just falls over. I don't know what you expect me to do. I love every person I meet.... like A LOT!!! I love treats & I might have a slight tennis ball obsession...... ok ok, it might be a little more than a slight obsession..... I love car rides & I love long naps on the couch..... & tennis balls... I also love any kind of nylabone, femur bone & anything fuzzy with a squeaker that I can de- stuff. My foster momma says that I am a bit of a diva- I would do best as the only 4 legged baby in your house. My absolute favorite thing in life is to be snuggling on the couch touching my person with a stuffy in my mouth!! #SpoiledMuch. Charlie Brown's adoption fee is $175. He is up to date on age appropriate vaccinations, neutered, and microchipped.\nAll of our dogs are spayed or neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccinations, microchipped and if over 6 months of age, heartworm tested and on heartworm preventative in their foster home.\n\nWe require an approved application to meet any of our dogs. We do not have a shelter location and will not arrange a meeting without an approved application.\n\nWe strive to make sure the bios provided for our dogs are complete and accurate; we do understand that mistakes happen, however, so if you absolutely cannot find the answer to your question in the dog's bio, you can contact us for more information.\n\nWe require a home visit for each dog we adopt out, so we adopt within a 2 hour radius of Dayton, OH. If you are outside of this radius, we encourage you to contact your local rescue or shelter.",

This female Pit Bull has an estimated DOB of 2/2019  and is one of those dogs who make you smile then laugh every time you play with her.  And play you will . . . Darcy loves to play along with loving to snuggle and loving to roll around on the floor with people - followed by more snuggles.  Darcy was found in an abandoned trailer caring for her puppies.  The puppies were saved but it took a little while longer for Darcy to be captured.  Since that time she has come to fully appreciate the comforts of a warm and dry place to live along with a super soft blanket on which she can sleep comfortably.  She has especially come to love being with people. We are recommending a home with no small children ONLY because she is a larger dog (62.2 pounds) who gets excited when playing and she could knock a smaller child over.  Darcy plays with some male dogs but could be an only dog as well.  this girl is one of a kind.\n\nIf you are interested in Darcy, please fill out an application here:\nhttps://www.parkvilleshelter.com/adoption-application",

She was turned into a local shelter & scheduled to be put down. Luckily local rescuers pulled her from the shelter. Unfortunately we have had difficulty placing her. Alex is a very loyal gal but her confidence level needs worked with. Alex needs an experienced German Shepherd owner that is up for a short challenge, someone that is also patient & able to work with her in the areas needed. Alex does not do well in a kennel setting- She becomes very anxious & will pace. She also refuses to eat. She has been placed with two fosters over her 1 plus year searching for a new forever family & in both homes the first 3 days were the hardest. Alex is unsure of new people & will growl which is very intimidating, however, once she realizes she is safe she becomes a total lover. She is not the German Shepherd dog for a 1st time owner of the breed. She is not the dog for someone that doesn't have the time, knowledge or willingness to work with her. Adopter needs to be confident & consistent with her training. Alex was raised with 3 small children without incident. She will become very protective of her people if adopter is not able to provide the leadership needed. Leadership is a must. Adopter will need to be patient with Alex at first & limit introducing her to a lot of people. It is imperative she feels safe & you get her trust before introductions to others. 'By getting her trust 1st we will ensure success.' Home visit & references required.  Located Jackson County WV    \n",

She has been with a foster for a little over a year & prior to that boarded. Owner was anxious & unable to provide the needed exercise & leadership so Diogi started exhibiting aggressive behaviors. Never towards people just towards herself. She would chase her tail while growling & barking at it. ( she never got it or harmed it) Diogi is not the dog for a 1st time owner of the breed or someone that does not have the time to exercise her & work with her. She can also be very intimidating when she goes after her tail but if the adopter is willing to provide exercise & is able to redirect & work with Diogi they will find she is a wonderful dog. (She loves walks & runs) In her current foster home the above behavior rarely happens now, however, it is important to disclose that if the exercise and mental work does not occur these behaviors can come back. Diogi may be OK with children, however, it is not being recommended she be place with small children. Possibly older children. Home visit & references required\n",

LOVE is the best thing ever and anyone can get love by adopting a shelter pet. I'm hoping a Hound-loving family comes soon to the shelter to adopt me. I love walks and spending time indoors with my loved ones. I love tennis balls and car rides too!\nLove, Clark \n\nThe dog/cat adoption fee, which is normally $60 unless we are having a special, includes spay or neuter, MICROCHIP, age-appropriate shots and health check. The shelter is at 2811 S.E. 29th St., phone # 297-3100. Use pet's ID # when inquiring. Special Adoption Fees: In the following cases, the adoption fee is $30-if more than one pet is adopted, if the pet is 4 years of age or older, if the pet has been in the adoption center more than 2 weeks, and if the pet is a 'special needs' pet.",

She is house trained as long as she has a consistent routine throughout the day.\nPlease email Suffolk Humane Society for information and application  at dogadoptions@Suffolkhumanesociety.com or call 757-477-1106 and leave message.

Amelie originally entered our program after being rescued from a dog fighting ring in Houston. At the time of her rescue (5ish months old), she was too young to be a breeder and had no wounds indicative of being in the fighting ring; although, it would be impossible to know what experiences she was exposed to. Amelie is a healthy, stunning, incredibly smart girl. She knows sit, down and shake; she is potty trained; and she is good in her kennel. While she gets along with other animals, we think she might be happiest in a home where she is the only pet or a home where there is already established control and order. Amelie is available for immediate placement and we can't wait to find her perfect person! Apply to adopt by visiting www.lwhbullies.org",

They unfortunately did not do a lot of training with him or even spend a lot of time with him, but despite his \"ruff\" start in life he is a friendly boy who is looking for a home with the time and patience to finish up his training and give him tons of mental and physical stimulation- he is an active, strong, and smart boy from his mix of breeds and we are so saddened that his previous home never spent the time with him to give him proper outlets! He would NOT be good in a home with small dogs, cats, or young children (under 14). He would benefit from a fenced yard or a VERY active home! His adoption fee is $295 and that includes he is neutered, microchipped, and up to date on all vaccines, flea/tick treatments, and heartworm preventative.

His previous owners were educated about dachshunds' weight and the risk of stairs but still allowed him to do stairs and get 6 pounds overweight. He is now back down to 14 pounds.\n\nOur must-haves for this sweet boy include:\n\n    A fenced yard\n    CANNOT do stairs/steps\n    No jumping or climbing\n    Another dog to keep him company if you have to be out of the house\n    His weight maintained at 13-14 pounds for his back's sake\n    No apartments or high rise apartments or condos\n    Needs a potty schedule\n\nDon't think because he's had IVDD that he can't run because he can keep up with the best of them, which is why he has to have a fenced yard. He loves kids, people, and attention. If you are home a lot he would be just fine as an only dog. He is a major toy destroyer. He loves to go for short walks and doesn't pull on the leash. Oscar will always walk with a bit of a wobble, but it only adds to his charm. Please give him a chance at a lasting home, he so deserves one!  \n============== Information for All Dogs/Adopters ==============\n\nIf you have questions about this dog, please feel free to contact the foster home at the email address listed above.  They have the most up-to-date information concerning the dog and would be happy to answer any questions about the animal. \n\nWe welcome out of state and Canadian adoptions, but we will not ship any dog via cargo.  You will have to make arrangements to pick up the dog or for them to go by ground transport.  If you choose transporting by either volunteers through our organization or by paid transporter, there will be an additional $45 fee added for the required Health Certificate. \n\nWe will not adopt into CT, RI, NH, ME, or MA due to strict laws regarding importation of dogs into those states.  If you have an issue with this, you need to take this up with your legislatures.\n\nTo understand the adoption process through AADR, please review the Adoption Information on our home page.  Transportation options are outlined on that page in Step 3.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this Dachshund please review Read Before You Adopt and then you can complete an Application.\n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN A RESCUE.\n\nPlease don't let the distance stand in your way of finding your newest best friend. We have volunteers that will help your \"new friend\" get up and down the East Coast. We just can't get them from one Coast to the other but some day we hope to have enough volunteers to do that as well.  For now, please look for dogs on your coast.\n",

Neo is a sweetheart and gets along w other dogs at the dog park/daycare, BUT must be THE ONLY DOG in the household for this adoption to be a success)\n\nMeet Neo. A2 handsome and loyal Siberian Husky. We wanted to help him get out of the shelter after his owner got evicted and left him behind. He was scared and alone.\n\nHe has been nothing but a wonderful surprise to his foster mom. He gets along with other dogs. He just wants to be loved and have human interaction. There is really nothing wrong with this boy to have been left behind in such a horrible way. \n\nHe enjoys car rides, and pool time. His ideal adopter must be one that enjoys staying active. Huskies are known to wonder, so a high fence will be required. Huskies are working dogs and must have a purpose. This breed is to be an inside dog specially in Texas. Brushing his hair should be done regularly. \n\nThis handsome boy is looking for a family that will be with him for the rest of his life. He is loyal. This boy is housebroken and crate trained.

            "description": "Hi! I am Cash a 3 year old, 84 lb. hound mix looking for my forever family. I am UTD, neutered, house broken, crate trained, and I am still learning how to walk like a perfect man on a leash. I am medium energy and would love a family to cuddle and snuggle with that loves a little adventure here and there. I have not been around cats or other dogs and would prefer a home with no little kids. I am a super healthy boy, however I do have some allergies (gotta love Florida!). A forever family sounds like a dream come true and I can not wait to find mine! \n\nI have to find my new forever home because I was no longer the right fit for my prior family (due to a recent situation) so my amazing foster mom took me in.\n\nAdoption requirements are as such:\n\n\n\tNo kids under 16\n\tNo other animals unless experienced in slow introductions and willing to take their time \n\tNo apts \n\tDog experience (has owned a dog prior)\n\n\nPlease note, Cash is part of Happy Trails Animal Rescues rehoming program. He has not been tested or evaluated and the information gathered is from the current owners personal statements regarding health and temperament. The owner is subject to placement outside of our organization. We cannot guarantee availability.",

            "description": "Serena is a wonderful dog! The scars on her face, neck, and body tell us that she's had a rough life so far - but you would never know based on her sweet disposition and warm, affectionate personality. Serena is so loyal and eager to please her humans. She forms strong bonds with people quickly and easily. She loves to snuggle. Serena got along very well with our 2 dogs (males, 40 and 80 lbs) and was still in the process of learning how to play and rough-house with the boys on her last day with us. She is completely house-trained, crate-trained, and she walks beautifully on a leash. It has been such a joy to watch her get comfortable in a loving home and grow into a confident, silly, happy dog. We hope that she doesn't have to wait too long for the cozy home and loving mom or dad that she is so deserving of. \n(Not that it matters, but we called her \"Rosie\" while she was with us so she may respond to that). \n\nHW+ simply means the dog has tested positive for heart worms in our screening process. We utilize what is called the fast-kill method which means we place the dog on antibiotics for 30 days and then administer 3 injections in increments afterward. The cost to treat heart worms is rather steep. However, thanks to our generous donors, we are able to cover that cost for our adopters so long as they go to our veterinarian, Red Rocks Animal Center in Lakewood.\n\n\n\tApproved Applicants may make the adoption fee payment by clicking donate above. Partial adoption fees will not hold a dog.\n\tDogs adopted with our rescue come with FREE training from #GoodPup to help you build strong bonds from the start!\n\tIf upon meeting the dog of your choosing at an adoption event you find that you aren't a good match, your deposit will be refunded minus a 10% administration fee.\n\tAdoption fees include vaccines up until time of adoption, microchip, spay/neuter and 1st 30 days of free Pet insurance. We are not affiliated with Pet First pet insurance. (you have to sign up for the insurance or it will not go into effect). \n\tAdopters can go to our vet for medical issues that may arise in 1st 3 days of adoption. \n\tThe dogs in our care are fostered in Colorado, Texas, and New Mexico. While all dogs are picked up during our scheduled times, sometimes transport dates change due to unforeseen circumstances.",

He has a special prescription diet, and with daily exercise, his last liver panel and kidney checkup was favorable. This means with proper excersise and special diet he should not need any treatment for this condition. He currently lives with 3 other dogs, one male and two female. He has lived with cats before as well. He has always lived with elderly female owners, and can be protective if dogs get too close to his \"mommy\" , or when he is patrolling the fence. Anthony will spend hours a day curled at your feet, or if allowed will share the couch with you. He will spend lazy afternoons with you, or will stay by your side for miles on walks. When he goes with you for a drive, he likes to sit on the floor behind your seat. Ifyou are interested in Anthony please complete an application at Havendogrescue.org and his foster mom will call you to discuss. Anthony is currently on a struct diet and excercise and his blood panel is normal.",

I know I wish I had her metabolism.\n\nTinsel is being held and carried by her foster mom to show her that humans and touch are a good thing. Tinsel loves to know what is going on around her. When you least expect it, Tinsel will come up to you and kiss you. It is such a great feeling.\n\nTinsel is working on her house manners and leash training. Tinsel does not like to walk on a leash but if a leash is on her, she will follow when out for a walk.\n\nTinsel has been hiking and she likes the hike but she also likes to be carried. Tinsel is enjoying being spoiled.\n\nTinsel is often found on the loveseat enjoying the sunshine. Tinsel has stolen the heart of everyone she has met. \n\n Tinsel is just over 7 lbs and 9 years old. She is spayed and UTD on all vaccinations and preventatives. \n\nTinsel's adoption fee is $250 and she qualifies for the senior to senior discount.",

This sweetheart was seized from a cruelty case, but luckily is showing no long-term effects of being kept on a heavy logging chain 24/7 for the first 2 years of his life.\n\nHe LOVES everybody and is kid friendly (but could accidentally knock small children over when excited). He walks well on a harness leash, takes treats gently, and knows SIT. \n\nThis guy is a shelter staff & volunteer favorite, so we're hoping he gets a loving family soon. One of our volunteers, Renee Hobbs, has been taking him on social outings/field trips so he gets to experience all the things he missed out on during the first 2 years of his life. He LOVES Sonic cheeseburgers, going for car rides, giving kisses, looking at himself in the mirror, and visiting local Hernando boutiques.\n\nOtis is neutered, UTD on everything and is currently being treated for heartworms. \n\nTo apply to adopt this smiling sweetheart, please visit this link https://www.jotform.com/hasadopt/pet-adoption-app or send an email to us at hasadoptions@gmail.com\n\nThe Pocket Pitbull, or Miniature Pitbull as this breed is sometimes known, is a more compact version of the well-known American Pitbull Terrier. A Pocket Bully is bred by crossing a Patterdale Terrier with an American Pitbull or American Staffordshire Terrier to produce a dog who is smaller in size, friendly, loyal, and loving.",

He knows \"sit\" and \"lay down;\" he needs training on leash walking but we're betting he'll pick that up quickly. Walker came into the shelter on Dec. 9 as a lost dog and his family has not found him. He is about 2 years old and weigh 60 pounds. He has  been neutered; he is up-to-date on vaccinations and will be microchipped upon adoption. Come meet him in Run 832 using ID#626385. Sadly he has tested positive for heartworms, but with treatment he should be good as new in no time. Please speak to your veterinarian regarding treatment options.\n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information. Shelter hours are: Tues. - Sun. 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. by appointment only until further notice, CLOSED Mondays & Holidays.",

She's a smart one that knows a few tricks and looks like she would be easy to train. We don't know how she is around children or cats.  She does not do well around other dogs.  She will need to be the only dog in her home.  She came in with a bump on her elbow that was treated. Ella needs ACL surgery.  She needs to be in a home prior to surgery as the shelter is not the right environment for her to heal from this. Ella requires at least a 4 foot fence.\n\nElla is a year old. Her current weight is around 80 pounds.\n\nThe minimum donation for Ella is $475.00. This includes all of her vetting. If you are interested in Ella, please fill out an online application through our website.\n\nWe are currently only open by appointment only. Due to the recent pandemic, we are looking at the safety of our volunteers that are there to take care of the dogs. Only serious inquiries will be considered.\n\nThen meet her at the shelter during adoption hours on Saturdays and Sundays 10 - 2pm. All members of the household need to meet the dog you are interested in. Vet records for any current or previous pets need to be provided. If all goes well, a home visit will be done prior to adoption.",

The good Samaritan took him home, but was unable to find his owners. Cornelius is his own dog. He gets along well with other small dogs. He is selective on interacting with people. He will allow you to handle him, unless he gets scared or threatened. He hates going to the vet. He would not be good with small children he doesn't know.

We have no idea what had happened to this female Golden Retriever mix in her short life (estimated DOB of 10/2019) but it couldn't have been good.  Honey has now been in a loving and patient foster home for a few months and she is thriving!  Her foster dad says that from his office he can hear Honey and her canine foster sister running and playing up and down the hall.  She no longer cowers when she sees the leash to go outside; she'll come to the door, stand, and wait for the leash to be put on and the walk to begin.  She has even gained enough confidence to jump over the 3 foot fence, but so far she's just gone to the front yard.  Honey will need a somewhat quiet house and patient owners to allow her to continue to gain confidence and not to lose hope if there are any set backs.  She'll definitely need with a larger playful dog (or two) sibling to give her dog confidence and allow her to play.  No small children since the sounds of small children cause her anxiety.  Once you gain Honey's trust you'll have unlimited love and loyalty for years to come.  \n\nIf you are interested in Honey, please fill out an application here:\nhttps://www.parkvilleshelter.com/adoption-application",

Submit an application from our website and then make an appointment to meet her.\n\nLadybird is not eligible for foster and will be a straight adoption. \n\nAge: ~13 years old\nWeight: ~13lbs\nHousebroken: Yes\nCrate trained: Working on it! Takes some time (10-30 minutes) to settle but overall doing great with her crate training.\nDog sociability: Prefers to be an only dog in the home but may have dog friends\nCat sociability: Not a match \nKids: Unknown\nIdeal home: Ladybird is looking for a home that is comfortable to take things slow with her as she warms up over time (with lots of high value snacks!) She prefers a quieter neighborhood so she doesn't have to pass by a bunch of other dogs or people while out on their walks as she can be a little nervous and barky. \n\nLadybird is a cuddly, affectionate girl who wants nothing more than to curl up on your lap all day (with some long walks in between, of course). This Nap Queen prefers the finer things in life, like hot dogs, soft blankets, and your undivided attention. But don't underestimate her athletic prowess-she can walk for an hour and then bolt up four flights of stairs without batting an eye. She is a great apartment dog, but would also do well in a house with a yard she could sniff around in. She can be nervous when she meets new people, especially men, but can be won over with patience and lots of hot dogs. If you are looking for a sweet, charming senior dog to lounge around with, you may find the perfect match in Ladybird! \n\nLadybird's adoption fee is sponsored thanks to a generous donor! She is spayed, up to date on core vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative. She will need a dental cleaning in the next year at the cost of her adopter. She also has a soft, round mass noted on her chest. Our vet suggests considering mass removal at time of her future dental.\n\n***We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications. We ask that you please be patient and someone will be in touch via email within 72 hours. Please do not email us unless you have not received a response in 72 hours. Please only fill out one adoption application. ***",

            "description": "Meet Smiley! This 1 yr old, very handsome Golden-mixed fella has only been with us a few days, but we have learned a bit about him already. He is shy, but friendly and enjoys human attention. Many things are new to him, so patience as he learns about the world is a must. Smiley would most likely be an amazing companion for someone who loves to hike and/or run regularly. When he is first out on leash he pulls and is very strong. After a short while he settles down and is a great outing companion. We have not yet done formal dog-dog introductions but so far he has shown to be interested in other people and dogs while out on leash\u2026but not reactive.\n\nTo date it is unknown how he would be with cats or young children under 7 years  of age.  As a result, he will need to go to a home where there are none.\n\n?Update 01-16-21:  Smiley has shown us that he adores spending time with dogs. He has done quite nicely with and enjoys himself when with multiple dogs and breeds. He would be a great pack member in a home with a large yard where his humans are devoted to dogs, exercise, and proper/positive reinforcement  training methods.  Smiley is a very affectionate boy who loves belly rubs. He does need some obedience training when it comes to leash manners, jumping up on people and furniture, and has shown to be a counter surfer in his first home. He has also shown to be most comfortable around women, although he has learned to trust several men as the weeks have passed. Right now our boy is looking for a well matched foster or forever home. We still don\u2019t know how he would do with kitties or small/young children.\n\nGRCGLARescue adopts within the counties of Los Angeles, Ventura, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego. Because we do require pre-adoption screening and post-adoption follow-up, we cannot support adoptions outside of this service area. \n\nIf you have a current application on file and would like to inquire about this dog, please email adoptions@grcglarescue.org. Otherwise, please make sure to complete the online adopter application found at http://www.grcglarescue.org/adopt before sending your inquiry.",

This young pup just wants to be near his people and LOVES his snuggle time.\n\nHam is house trained and is still working on crate training. He doesn't like to be confined but is getting used to it. We think he's part husky and he shows the breed's desire to roam, so a secure fence is a must. He's making great progress walking nicely on the leash and loves to be outside. He'd make a great hiking buddy. He knows how to sit and lie down and is working on other basic commands. He loves treats so he's making fast progress! \n\nHam is good with other dogs and is completely indifferent and non-reactive to his senior foster sister's grumpiness. He is a strong guy and can play a little rough, so a home without small children would be best. Could this beautiful boy be right for your family?",

Please do not use the links provided on the listing by Petfinder. >>\n<p>\nPLEASE NOTE:  A former DVBR family whose dog passed away recently reached out to us and they will be adopting Dolly. Their application came in among the initial flurry of applications. So, unless things fall through, Dolly is spoken for. Thank you all for your interest. Dolly had well over 100+ applications in less than 24 hours. But it looks like she has found her 'furever' home. \n<p>\nDolly is  a 3 month old puppy. She weighs about 3 or 4 lbs. and is about the cutest thing we've ever laid eyes on. Her favorite activity is looking for what kind of trouble she can start! The 14 yr. old female bichon she is currently living with in her foster home is very anxious for her to leave. Dolly's PERFECT family would have a fenced yard and another small, playful, young dog who won't think she's a pest. Ideally, someone would be around a lot, because this little baby LOVES attention. She LOVES to play and she plays hard. Dolly is not 100% house trained, but she's pretty darn close. She has an accident now & again, but she completely \"gets it\" and it's just a matter of time before the accidents are non-existent. Honestly, most of the time they are our fault and not hers. She's is the sweetest thing on Earth and we will be sad to see her go, but our little 14 yr. old bichon, Annie, will be throwing a party for all the geriatric bichons in the neighborhood! If you think you might make a great home for Dolly, step 1 would be to fill out an application. Once we have an application with a valid email address, we will get in touch. Do not call. We expect to be deluged with applications and will get to each person as quickly as possible. We will NOT place Dolly until AFTER Christmas. You can find an application on our website:  www.dvbr.org and our email address for questions is bichonrescue@gmail.com \n",

She was abandoned by her previous owners at one of the most horrific kill shelters in the Rio Grande Valley. She was suffering from extreme malnutrition but has since achieved a healthy weight while in foster care. She now becomes very talkative if her foster mom is late with dinner! Hope lives in a foster home with other Great Danes and she interacts nicely with them - although she does not put up with any nonsense from the energetic younger Great Danes.\nHope did test positive for ehrlichia which is a bacteria infection caused by a tick bite and she completed a 30-day course of doxycycline.\nPlease understand you are committing to providing a good home for her entire life (up to 15+ years or more.)\nYou must be committed to housebreaking, age-appropriate enrichment and exercise, leash training, grooming needs, and positive socialization.\nHer adoption fee is $250.

She is, however, DEAF and will require someone with patience while she is navigating her way through life not being about to hear. She is currently in a foster home with two other dogs and does great with them. She also loves to go to the dog park and loves every dog she meets. We don't think cats would be a good fit or children under 10 as though they could startle her easily. She is potty trained but doesn't like being crated. She loves to be touched and snuggled. We are also giving one private training session with our professional trainer to whoever adopts her.  She is spayed, microchipped, up to date on vaccines and started on heartworm and flea prevention. Her adoption/donation fee is $250.00. If you would like to meet Polly, please fill out the application on our website at www.wagsandwigglesfw.com under available pets.",

He does not like cats so please no cats.  Loves to play with his foster siblings. He is potty trained and crate trained. He loves to snuggle, does great in the car and knows basic commands. Nick would do best with a fenced in yard. He likes to run and play. He would be a great addition to any family. He is neutered, microchipped, up to date on vaccines and started on flea and heartworm prevention. His adoption/donation fee is $350.

His foster reports that he is anxious to trust and love and has quickly adopted and blossomed into an affectionate and loyal companion. He is a highly intelligent, active and sensitive and loves his belly rubs!!! While he is still practicing walking on a leash - he will need a fenced in back yard (no apts/condos). He is ready for his forever home and would enjoy an active, stimulating environment with a yard to play in.\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\nSponsor Me! Make a tax-deductible donation today by visiting us at http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/donate/ . Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support!\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\nPlease \"like\" our Facebook Page for the most current events and new dogs.\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!",

            "description": "If you are interested in adopting this dog, please download and complete an Adoption Questionnaire from our website and email Barbara at matisse1600@gmail.com\nYou can learn about the adoption process and find a Word, PDF and ONLINE version of the questionnaire by visiting: http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/howtoadopt/.\nDog's Name: Luke\nEstimated Breed : Lab/Bassett Hound Mix\nApproximate Age: 1 year\nApproximate Weight: approx. 36 lbs\nCurrently Living at: Boarding\nAdoption Fee: $300\nDOG'S DESCRIPTION\nLuke is a handsome boy looking for a loving forever home where he can run, play and be your best buddy. He loves to fetch. Luke is very smart and eager to learn. His favorite treats are the freeze-dried kind, and he loves a stuffed Kong. He is quite energetic and will need a lot of exercise. Luke is very timid and would not do well in a busy city living. No apartments for this little guy. He needs to be in a home with a fenced-in backyard in a suburban environment. Older kids and he is probably better off as the only dog in the house.\nGive him a chance, and he'll wag his way into your heart.\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\nSponsor Me! Make a tax-deductible donation today by visiting us at http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/donate/ . Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support!\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\nPlease \"like\" our Facebook Page for the most current events and new dogs.\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!",

Their only family is gone, forever. \n\nSabyn is a very mellow female Great Pyrenees, 8 yrs old. She looks like she is twice that age from the neglect and depression. She has spondylosis and is arthritic. Nothing can really be done about this except to ease her pain with meds the rest of her life. She is currently on medications that are working well, and are not costly. She might enjoy Aqua-therapy or acupuncture if given the opporrunity. \n\nWovey is her 7-8 yr old lab mix sister. She had 2 large tumors removed when our southern rescue partner saved her. To the vet's surprise, both were benign! She is just \"lumpy\" and has small benign tumors pop up from time to time. \n \nThey seem to be fine with dogs and cats, Sabyn likes kids, Wovey isn't sure. \n\nAdoption fees cover age specific vaccinations, spay/neuter, microchip, heartworm/lyme/ehrlichia test, worming and transport fees. \n\nAdoption fees: \nThrough 6 months of age $450; \n7 months to through 5 years $400; \n6 years and under 9 years $325: bonded pairs are $500; \n9 years and older $250: bonded pairs are $300 \n\nAlmost Home Rescue of New England is a 501 c 3 non-profit rescue; rescuing dogs since 2005. All Adoption applications are completed on line at www.almosthomerescue.net \n\nThis dog is available unless it is marked as Pending, meaning Pending Adoption. This dog is in foster care locally, ONLY if Maine or New Hampshire is listed next to the dogs name; otherwise, the dog is still waiting with our partner rescue for an adoption or foster home in New England. \n\nPLEASE NOTE - We will check your veterinary reference, to ensure that current and prior dogs have a history of being kept up to date on rabies and distemper, have had annual heartworm tests, and are on heartworm preventative at least 6 months of the year. Current pets must by spayed/neutered. \n\nImported dogs are transported on a USDA approved transport with a Health Certificate. All imported dogs are quarantined 14 days prior to getting on transport.\n\n",

She reportedly has lots of \"puppy energy\" and sometimes jumps up on ppl in excitement. She has a small bump on foot which will be taken care of by rescue. Because of her craziness at times, she would be best in a home with no small children, and can overwhelm other dogs but she has done ok with some dogs - it would have to be a meet and greet situation with any resident pets. Her ideal family would be an active single or couple who would love a dog that has personality plus and would put the time in to train her exuberance to agility or tracking or hiking. She can mellow out and cuddle but it\u2019s in between her yippee moments \n\nAdoption fee covers: all vetting to age (including deworming, deflea etc ), spay/neuter (to be done at 6-8 months of age if not already done and included in adoption fee, and dependent on our clinic's availability (getting more caught up from the Covid-19 pause as time goes by),  free 30 days of pet insurance, 6 week obedience course, and lifetime support of rescue.\n\nPlease fill out an application here for consideration: Tinyurl.Com/appshdr\n\n* During this COVID-19 crisis, we are essentially doing only virtual application processing and meetings are using social distancing practices. We will not have any open hours until further notice and doing meet and greets by appointment with the utmost caution for personal safety. We are not a shelter so there are no dogs at the shop unless we have open hours. All our dogs are in foster care and are available to be seen by appointment.\n\nNOTE: If a dog is listed as Adoptable, he or she is still available at that time. Also, our adoption area is within a several hour radius of us in Rochester, NY (NOT including Canada - sorry!)\n",

Hound breeds are very prominent in the rural south and usually the first to be euthanized at the shelter due to the overpopulation of this breed.\n\nNot compatible with: Dogs\n\nNot tested with:\n\nKids, Cats\n\nHi, I'm Bernie! I'm a sweet and serious pup with beautiful puppy dog eyes. I'm a major snuggle bug even though I'm 65 lbs -- I act like a lap dog! I am working on walking nicely on a leash but I'm a smart pup so I'm certain to learn quickly with some consistent training. I can get aggravated with other dogs so I need to be the only dog in a home. I'm just a grumpy guy sometimes and I like my space! I also get spooked with loud noises sometimes. If I had a family who can work on my leash skills and build my confidence, that would improve. I love people more than anything else and will follow you around all day to get pets and snuggles.\n\nI can't wait to find my forever home where I can share all the love I've got to give!\n\nAdoption Application:\n\nhttp://bit.ly/adoptrdr\n\nAdoption Application:\nhttp://bit.ly/adoptrdr\n\nFoster Application: http://bit.ly/fosterapprdr\n\nAdoption Process: In order to adopt, we require an adoption application. After you submit an application, if you pass the screening, we will contact you to schedule a phone interview. We will call your references, including your veterinarian and landlord (when appropriate). We will also conduct a home visit. After these steps are complete, you will be approved to adopt a dog. Please note this process takes 1-2 weeks so applications submitted when you are ready to bring a dog home within that time frame. You can meet our adoptable dogs at events, however, we cannot guarantee that dogs at events do not have pre-approved applicants meeting them there as well, so the application is the best way to start the process.\n\nMission Statement: Forever true to \"The Underdog\", Rural Dog Rescue is dedicated to saving the lives of dogs in shelters who are often overlooked for adoption or rescue. We save the dogs who are at most risk of being euthanized: the hounds, the black dogs, the seniors, the sick and the broken. We make a commitment to reserve a minimum of 50% of the dogs we save to The Underdog. Root For The Underdog!\n\nRural Dog Rescue's home base is in Washington, DC. We adopt to the Washington, DC metropolitan area to include Maryland and Northern Virginia.\n\nWe support several high kill shelters that euthanize in 72 hours and whose kill rate is 70% or higher in rural areas of Virginia, West Virginia, North and South Carolina. Rural Dog Rescue also helps dogs in need in Washington, DC and Maryland.\n\nWe are 100% volunteer and foster based and no salaries are paid. 100% of your donation and adoption fee goes to helping the dogs and cats of Rural Dog Rescue.\n\nAlthough we try to be as accurate as possible, Rural Dog Rescue cannot guarantee the breed or full-grown adult size of any of the dogs or puppies in its care. Because many of these dogs were found as strays or are the result of irresponsible, unplanned breeding, we do not know the dog's exact background and can only list breed and size by our best educated guess. If exact breed and size are important to you, please consider adopting a dog from a specific breed rescue. Our goal is for our dogs to be adopted by people who will love and care for them forever for who they are - no matter what breed and size they turn out to be!\n\nAll dogs go to their new homes spayed or neutered, up to date on all shots, dewormed (although a second deworming may be required), started on heartworm and flea and tick preventative and sometimes microchipped.",

She has been a diligent mother to her seven puppies, despite being ostensibly a puppy herself. Rosie needs someone that will teach her that humans can be trusted and to teach her how to be a good doggie citizen.\nRosie is very smart, and requires stimulation and exercise to be her best self. She is very curious, and very loving.  She wants to be by your side as much as possible and loves to give affection.\nRosie is a sweet, sweet girl but no one taught her basic manners. She\u2019s working on not jumping and her leash behavior. She has shown some minor resource guarding which with a little training can be brought under control. Because she has so much energy, she would do best in a home without very young children or senior pets.\nShe\u2019s got the cutest tall ears and beautiful coloring. Rosie is about a year old and ~45 pounds. She is heartworm negative, spayed, and ready! If you want an affectionate, sweet, attentive adventure buddy, and you love an underdog, then Rosie is the gal for you.\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2020 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq",

He is a ton of fun, loves adventures and does well with both dogs and cats! Rambo is a big people dog and should be in a home with a family that has time to devote to him. He would do fantastic with a very active family. He is crate and house trained. Rambo is also leash and off leash trained. He has resource guarding so we highly recommended a family experienced with this and can continue to work with him. No children. Fenced yard required. Applications online at ruffredemption.org\nVisit ruffredemption.org to complete an application. All Ruff Redemption Dogs are spayed/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption. They also receive a minimum of two distemper/parvo vaccines, medication for the treatment and prevention of intestinal worms, and monthly heart worm/flea prevention while in our care. Rabies vaccines are given if the dog is 16 weeks of age or older.\n\n2/2/21 4:21 PM",

            "description": "If you are interested in adopting this dog, please download and complete an Adoption Questionnaire from our website and email US at\n\nmichelel@k-9lifesavers.org\n\nYou can learn about the adoption process and find a Word, PDF and ONLINE version of the questionnaire by visiting: http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/howtoadopt/.\n\nDog's Name: Sugar\n\nEstimated Breed : Bulldog Mix\n\nApproximate Age: 2 years\n\nApproximate Weight: approx. 45 lbs\n\nCurrently Living at: Boarding\n\nAdoption Fee: $375\n\nDOG'S DESCRIPTION\n\nSugar is a sweet momma dog waiting for a loving forever home. She loves affection, and is super sweet. She is currently at a foster home and is friendly with the foster family dog. Foster mom says she is a really pleasant easy dog to have around. She does not always know her strength when giving love, so best with kids over 10. The foster family adores her!\n\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\n\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\n\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\n\nSponsor Me! Make a tax-deductible donation today by visiting us at http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/donate/ . Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support!\n\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\n\nPlease \"like\" our\nFacebook Page\nfor the most current events and new dogs.\n\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!",

He loves to play fetch and will require a fenced in yard. He is looking for a previous Shepherd owner family that is energetic, is a regular outdoorsy family that will let him join them in their outdoor adventures. He will need lots of exercise like long walks, jogs or hikes daily to burn off his young shepherd energy. Because of his young rambunctious behavior we recommend no children.

She is considered feral, but just in the few days we have had her she has already started taking treats from our hands. We will be working with her daily on her socialization skills. Last March we adopted out 3 feral dogs from the same case, and they are all doing wonderfully in their homes. If you are interested in her please fill out our adoption application found at www.countryclubkennels.com, or feel free to call us at 540-788-3559.",

She is considered feral, but just in the few days we have had her she has already started taking treats from our hands.  We will be working with her daily on her socialization skills.  Last March we adopted out 3 feral dogs from the same case, and they are all doing wonderfully in their homes. If you are interested in her please fill out our adoption application found at www.countryclubkennels.com, or feel free to call us at 540-788-3559.",

            "description": "Welcome Sully to Battle for the Bully! Sully is a year old and comes to us already vetted and ready for adoption. His foster mom writes the below:\n\"Sully is the happiest, goofiest, most handsome Pitbull-Boxer mix who is looking for a home as loving as he is. He loves to cuddle (all 65 lbs of him) and be near his people. He is most fond of his \u201cbreakfast\u201d (his three meals each day) and his daily walks. He plays very well with other dogs at doggy day care, which he attends 3-4x a week.\n\nSully loves to sleep with his humans on the bed, but is also kennel trained and will sleep in his kennel. He is fully house-trained. He knows many words (sit, lay, come, wait, car ride, walk, outside, shake, breakfast, toy, cookie, treat, etc.). The one word that he has not mastered yet is \u201cdrop.\u201d He can be stubborn, and will occasionally not give up a food item if he finds it on a walk.  Sully isn\u2019t scared of much\u2026except the vacuum. He hasn\u2019t quite figured out what this very loud, object is that mom and dad push around the living room.\n\nSully will live best in a home where can spend a lot of time with his people. He would most enjoy a home where he has a fenced in yard to play, and where he is regularly attended to. He would also like an active family that likes to go on walks or hikes.  He still has puppy tendencies and is still learning to not pull too hard on the leash. Keeping him busy and stimulated is important.\nIf you are looking for a sweet, happy guy with the biggest heart, look no further -  Sully is your main man. He\u2019ll be loyal \u2018til the end and deserves the same in return\"\n\nPlease understand we match our dogs based on temperament/needs, not physical appearance. If you are unable to accommodate the needs of Sully, please do not apply. We would like his transition to be as seamless as possible. \n\nPlease review our website and review our FAQ's before applying. Sully will not be placed in a home with kids under the age of 13 years due to his playful nipping, no exceptions. Link to website below:\n\nhttps://www.battleforthebully.org/\n",

I was interested in cats, so a slower introduction is a good idea. I get along with some dogs.\n\nI am an older guy and I do have hip dysplasia of my left rear.

He does LOVE his toys, but of course needs a nice LONG nap after playing to rest his tired paws. His foster mom said he is very house trained and will let you know if he must go potty. He also likes to accompany his foster mom to work, if and only if, he decides to get out of bed. At work he greets everyone and makes sure they are getting their work done. As you can tell, Richard loves attention, he loves it so much that he would prefer to be the only animal in the home. But don't worry, once you meet Richard you will realize you don't need anything else in life then this jolly old man!

He does need some confidence building, but is super treat motivated so this does help with introducing him to new people. He is fully crate trained and is perfectly fine being left alone while he foster steps out for an hour or two. He is also house trained and really playful with his foster.   He does use his mouth to play but we are working on improving that. He is quite the cuddler and loves being held like a baby! Comet can get a little nippy when people move to quickly until he trusts you, which doesn't take very long, but for this reason he cannot be in a home with kids. Comet does well with other dogs, but can be fearful with larger dogs.\n\nIf you are not ready to adopt just yet and would like to help in other ways, please consider clicking on the green \u201cSponsor Me\u201d button above to help this dog receive the best care we can give. We rely on the generosity of others to make rescuing dogs possible.\n\nIF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING THIS DOG, PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU HAVE READ THE DOG'S INFORMATION CAREFULLY.

ALL of our dogs reside in foster homes in the greater Pittsburgh, PA area. \n\nWe are a 100% volunteer organization. Please respect our volunteers' time. If a dog is listed on PetFinder, he/she IS available for adoption. We cannot reply to messages, phone calls, and emails about a dog until we have received, reviewed, and approved an adoption application. \n\nOur ADOPTION application is found at www.seniorhearts.org Completing this application is the first step in our adoption screening process. You MUST complete the application in its entirety in order to be considered as a potential adopter.  Please select \"More About Us\" for further details on our adoption requirements.  You can meet a dog ONLY after we have completed our adoption approval process.\n\nIf you are looking at the dog below, it most certainly means the dog is available for adoption. We look forward to receiving your application in hopes that you are able to meet our adoption requirements and provide this dog with a loving furever home.\n\nAnd now a word from our sweet Cookie...\n\nI will tell you a bit about myself. I am 11 years young. I could almost fit in your pocket weighing only 8 pounds. I'm a shy girl. I don't like lots of commotion and new things scare me. But once I am comfortable I am easy going. I'm not a needy girl. I enjoy my independence.\n\nI like to go on short walks and explore the great outdoors. I do require a fenced yard. I do want to have a doggie sibling. He will help me feel comfortable.   \n\nI do appreciate getting lots of love and snuggles from humans too. After all I am the sweetest Cookie you may ever meet.\n\nI am looking for a calm adult only home. I can be adopted within a two-hour radius of Pittsburgh, PA. If you are interested in giving me a furever home, you must first complete the adoption application at www.seniorhearts.org\n\nxoxo\nCookie\n",

I was picked up on a busy Highway one day; the person who picked me up witnessed someone throwing me out of their truck. Made me feel like a piece of trash. But that\u2019s okay because the cool folks at ARFhouse took me in and It\u2019s like I\u2019m a brand new dog!! \n\nI am a sweet, young Doberman; approximately 2 years old and I weigh 73 lbs. BIG BOY! I love to play, get all the belly rubs and snuggle with my favorite humans. I get along fine with other dogs but would prefer to be the only dog in the home. I want all the attention for myself. Because of my size and energy level, I would not be suitable for an apartment; I need a large, fenced yard so I can run and play whenever I want! \n\nThe fee to adopt Conan is $200.00; this includes spay/neuter, deworming, vaccinations and a microchip. If you are interested in adopting Conan, please visit our website. www.arfhouse.org and fill out an adoption application. \n\n**Please Note: Conan is currently located at our facility in Sherman, Texas. Adoptions are by-appointment only; if you would like to meet Conan, please fill out an application on our website. Once we have your application, our Adoption Coordinator will follow up with you ASAP with any questions she may have, or to set up a meet-and-greet.",

            "description": "Dee is in a foster home, and is currently not at the shelter. Please find info below on how to adopt her, thanks. \n\nImagine - a chilly winter evening, you and me, snuggled up on the couch, watching our fav Netflix show. Or, you've had a rough day at work, but you come home to my smiling face and wagging tail, and now you've got a huge smile on your face too.....our life together would be amazing! I'm a silly, curious, sometimes zoomy girl who's excited about life. At eight years young, I'm sprightly and acrobatic and always up for training and games - I'm food motivated and love to learn. Sleeping in bed with my foster parent is great, maybe you'll let me sleep with you too? Hanging out in my crate is cool, but my foster parent doesn't require me to stay in it when they're gone because I'm such a good girl I never ever get into things I shouldn't!\n\nI thrive on structure and a regular schedule that includes training. So far I've learned come', sit', let's go this way' and we're working on touch'. I've got house training down. While I almost never bark when the doorbell rings, I will warn you when there's a squirrel intruder in the back yard! Dee is learning to relax more while on the leash - sometimes other dogs and squirrels especially can be distracting to her!\nHere's what I need from you, my forever family to be - plenty of prior dog experience and dog behavior knowledge, a home without any other pets (I really prefer humans to other dogs) or young children, and a quiet neighborhood. Absolutely nothing would make me happier than a home for the holidays!\n\nHOW TO ADOPT - Please fill out a Dog Adoption Application, available at http://www.seattle.gov/animalshelter/forms.htm and email it to the Seattle Animal Shelter Foster Dog Program at adoptionreview@gmail.com.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Many of our dogs will receive numerous applications, and the Seattle Animal Shelter asks for your patience during the process of finding the very best match. If you have questions about this dog that have not been answered above, please contact us at sasfosterdogs@gmail.com. If you would like to arrange to meet this dog, you must submit an adoption application. Thank you!",

Rosie belong to a 93-year-old woman who passed away. We can\u2019t imagine Rosie living with a 93 yr old! Rosie loves her walks and will pull our volunteers around the park. She is reactive with other dogs and was the only dog in her previous home. She is not cat compatible and would do best as the only pet to soak up all of your love and attention. Rosie adores children and Although she might be a bit of a handful with wee little ones, kids 7 and up would be ideal. Rosie would do best with a fenced yard due to her reactivity with other animals \u2013 it would give her a safe place to go potty in between walks. Rosie was very well cared for in her previous home. She had blood work done in July which showed some elevated liver values. She is currently on a liver supplement - Denamarin (over-the-counter) which she takes every morning in a pill pocket. Rosie has been vaccinated, spayed, microchip and heartworm tested negative. Adoption $200. If you or the family Rosie is looking for, please fill out an application www.companimals.org.",

She is very treat driven and she can't help that she loves her Blue Health Bars and Sizzlers. Cookie does love to play and run. She can be a bit rambunctious around smaller dogs just because of her energy levels. She has been tested with kids 5 and up and she is very submissive and loves to bump noses and give kisses. Cookie is looking for a new home with other playful dogs so she won't be lonely. She should fit in with an active family or person.\nOriginal: Cookie is an adorable lab mix who was found and not claimed. She is black with speckled toes and white chest. Cookie also has a stub tail. We don't know what happened there. She is about 4-6 months old and she is a chunky 35 pounds. Cookie loves to play with other dogs and kids. She will need to learn her manners and wil most likely need a little help with house training. Don't be surprised if she chews a little as well.

(: I love to play with all kinds of toys and have tons of energy so will need an active family. After I get it all out though, I make a great snuggler.  I am also dog friendly with proper introduction, and totally crate trained. I know my basic commands too! And, I'm doing better on the leash every day. I would do best in a home with older children, due to my energy level\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete our Pre-application: https://form.jotform.us/asr628/ShortAdoptionInquiry\n\n---------------------PLEASE READ-------------------------------\nOur dogs are dogs are fostered in Texas but available for adoption in the Pacific Northwest...With stops in - Lacey, WA  and Portland, OR.\nThese dogs are transported to a predetermined location agreed upon by the rescue.\n\nOur out of state adoption fee is $500. This fee includes spay/neuter, current vaccinations, a registered microchip, a negative heartworm test, health certificate, and transport costs. \nAs an Apollo direct adoption, the adoption interview/meet and greet occurs on video call (Skype, FB Messenger call, Facetime, etc).

            "description": "Birthday: 11/17/2015\nPet ID: 131037\n\nAsia is more than ready for her happily ever after!\n\nThis exuberant lady unfortunately came in as a neglect case back in November. Her skin was all types of messed up due to Demodectic mange. Through the wonders of TLC and veterinary care, Asia now looks as good as new!\n\nAsia is around 5 years of age. However, she still has lots of puppy energy and reminds us of Wonder Woman because of the super strength she possesses. She will definitely need a strong handler equipped for teaching her basic manners and leash walking skills. Asia also LOVES squeaky toys and showing them off to her hooman friends during playtime.\n\nThe only thing we are still working on getting under control healthwise with Asia is her extreme happy tail. The tip of her tail was completely raw when she came into our care, and she would wag it so hard that it would fling blood everywhere. We currently have it wrapped to promote healing and have placed an e-collar on her to keep her from picking at the bandage, which seems to be working!\n\nIf you\u2019d like to give Asia the loving home she so deserves, then give us a call at 804-991-3200 to set up a meet-and-greet today!\n\nIf you have any questions about our adoptable pets, we can be reached by phone at 804-991-3200 or by email at pganimals@princegeorgecountyva.gov.\n\nBe sure to check out our Facebook and Instagram pages at Facebook.com/pganimals and Instagram.com/pganimals!",

            "description": "Hobbes is a happy, active and highly cuddly dog.   He loves curling up by the wood stove and chewing on his doggy toys.  He is crate trained, house trained, rides well in a car with a barrier (as he would prefer to be in your lap), loves to play ball, tucks himself to sleep and has attended basic obedience classes.  He knows sit, wait, come, lay-down, roll-over, will heel when he isn't full of beans especially if you have a treat motivator.  Hobbes will let you touch his paws, cut his nails, and clean his ears while enjoying the attention and rubs.  He has been in a foster home with other dogs he wants to be the only animal in the home. He is a beautiful and loving brindle boy with a mischievous side about one year of age and loves people. Hobbes is very loving and He snuggles and tucks his nose into your arm when next to you and when lays behind you in a chair, with his head he'll place it gently on your thigh. If you're on the sofa and looking for an oversized lap dog, he's your boy. Because of his size he'd be best in a home with older children. Hobbs's best home would be where he can be near his humans and have access to toys and chews so he can entertain himself.  If you can commit to a one-dog home with a highly loving and loyal boy please consider Hobbes. These precious puppies and dogs were released to our rescue or were all pulled from kill shelters and are looking for a forever home where they can love on a family to call their own. The faster we can find forever homes for these sweeties, the more Winnies Legacy Rescue can save. We often pull black dogs as they have the least chance to make it out. Please please share this posting so we can network to make a difference in their life. If you'd like to adopt, in the adoption fee, we make zero profit. It covers pull fee from the shelter, transportation to our Charlotte, VT location, vetting, paperwork to get them across state lines, shots, deworming, food and more. (Please do not fill out an application if you're not able to come to VT to adopt) You can also help by liking, following and sharing our f.b. page Winnies Legacy Canine Rescue. Our web page is https:www.winnieslegacy.com if you would like an adoption application. If you'd like to foster to assist us in saving lives like these darlings.",

He does know how to sit, shake, high five and lay down. \n\nChino is particular with dogs, he is a very dominant dog and likes to be the boss. He did fine with the smaller female dog and the larger sized medium dog he was introduced too as well. Both females were afraid of him, since he is so dominant. But he ultimately did try to play with the larger girl. \n\nI think once he is neutered and once his testosterone is out of his system that he would do better with male dogs, but that is just a guess.\n\nHe is absolutely wonderful with people and loves attention, he is housebroken and he will make a wonderful addition to a new family.",

She weighs 52 pounds. She is all around friendly with everyone that she meets with the exception of kids, she isn't too fond of them and would do best with a home without them. She is a loveable girl who craves lovings. If you stop, she will talk to you and ask you for more! She loves to be with her people, she doesn't like to be left alone outside. She does best with male dogs. We suspect her birthday to be around February 2019.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete our Pre-application: https://form.jotform.us/asr628/ShortAdoptionInquiry\n\n----------------------PLEASE READ-------------------------------\nOur dogs are dogs are fostered in Texas but available for adoption in the Pacific Northwest...With stops in - Lacey, WA  and Portland, OR.\nThese dogs are transported to a predetermined location agreed upon by the rescue.\n\nOur out of state adoption fee is $500.

            "description": "Bart (Snoop) was surrendered to a local shelter when his owner could no longer care for him. He is just about a year old and very much still a puppy. Bart is underweight at about 70 pounds and will be a big boy once he fills out. He is a typical GSD that loves to follow his person around. Bart likes playing and chewing his toys along with playing tug. He is intelligent and picks up on new commands quickly. Bart is very playful, and is still learning boundaries. He can be mouthy when being handled, especially around his head. His foster dad is working on teaching him to move away instead of becoming mouthy. Bart would do best in a home with older dog savvy children. He is a strong boy on leash but does well being walked on a harness. Bart is very good in his crate and his adopter should continue to utilize one to give him down time and relax. Training will be necessary for Bart to continuing socializing and work on basic commands. Bart has never lived with other dogs and while he is not dog aggressive, he would do best as an only dog. He is not confident or socialized with other dogs. Bart will thrive in a home willing to provide him mental and physical stimulation - after all German Shepherds are working dogs! \n\nThe application is our first step and we will let you know as soon as it arrives. Adoption fee includes: spay or neuter, all shots, heart worm testing, fecal test and microchip..\n\nMany questions can be answered by going to www.gsrescue1.org",

She weighs 52 pounds. She is all around friendly with everyone that she meets with the exception of kids, she isn't too fond of them and would do best with a home without them. She is a loveable girl who craves lovings. If you stop, she will talk to you and ask you for more! She loves to be with her people, she doesn't like to be left alone outside. She does best with male dogs. We suspect her birthday to be around February 2019.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete our Pre-application: https://form.jotform.us/asr628/ShortAdoptionInquiry\n\n----------------------PLEASE READ-------------------------------\nOur dogs are dogs are fostered in Texas but available for adoption in the Pacific Northwest...With stops in - Lacey, WA  and Portland, OR.\nThese dogs are transported to a predetermined location agreed upon by the rescue.\n\nOur out of state adoption fee is $500.

I like to learn, but sometimes it is much more fun to not listen immediately, so I will need a family that will be firm and set expectations from the get go. I am good in my crate and am learning to slow down my eating and not inhale or guard in any way.  I am active, but like most pitties, am not the biggest fan of the cold...big wusses we are.  I am good with other dogs, but I do play rough and will need a playmate that is able to be tolerant but correct when need be. My new family is going to get a fun, happy guy who is really ready for a stable, loving home that will make sure I mind my manners. \n\nADOPTION FEE: $200 (All MVPC dogs are heartworm-tested, completely vetted, spayed/neutered, microchipped, crate-trained and house-trained)\n\nA $100 hold fee is required for approved applications and will be applied to the full adoption fee at the time of the home visit. \nADOPTER: Dog experience\nBIRTHDAY: Estimated 1-2 years\nFENCE: Required (an electric fence is not an acceptable form of containment)\nDOGS: Yes\nCATS: Unknown, but can test\nKIDS: Yes, over 5 please\n\nINQUIRIES: ALL inquiries begin with a submitted adoption application, which is found on our website, www.miamivalleypitcrew.com. We do not adopt to individuals under the age of 25. We prefer male/female dog pairings unless both already reside in the home. \n\nDO NOT: USE THE PETFINDER CONTACT/ADOPT BUTTONS--we are unable to monitor those and you will not receive a response. \n\nPLEASE NOTE: We are volunteer based and a home visit is required; we have a two-hour adoption radius from Kettering, OH for our adult dogs and 75 miles for our puppies. Exceptions for our ADULT dogs only, though rare, may be made on a case-by-case basis but we must be able to do a home visit. Thank you for your understanding!",

This is where Streetdog Foundation stepped in and rescued me! I was adopted and living the good life in Alabama when my adopted family got too big and too busy. Sometimes in life, things just don't work out, so I have made my way back to my Streetdog family in Memphis.\n\nDespite all of these recent changes, I'm in great spirits, and I\u2019m hopeful that I\u2019ll find a new forever family to call my own! As you can see, I'm a cute chunky hunky dude who\u2019s just looking for a home full of love, belly rubs, and cuddles. I'm well past the puppy stage and into my more mature, wiser age. I'm approximately 8 years old, and I am a big fan of other dogs and people! I hope to meet you soon! \n",

My foster mom helped me make it - it was so much fun! :)\n\nI am house trained, and my foster mom lets me sleep in bed with her at night! I am a little nervous around new people at first, but I warm up pretty quickly. My foster sister is only 4 years old, but older children are recommended since I can be bouncy and accidentally knock them over. I am good with other dogs and would love to meet any potential canine siblings. I am high energy and would benefit from some training. I am very treat motivated and take it gently so training should be no problem! I would do best in a home without cats and love a home with a yard to run so no apartments for me please! \n\nApply to meet me at tailsandtrails.org\n\n*Email info@tailsandtrails.org with questions*",

When we saw his post we agreed to help him, because he is our kind of fella! Barney loves to go on walks and is good with other dogs his size. He doesn't really care for little dogs, so no littles in the home for him. He likes toys and uses a doggy door. He loves being with his people and just hanging out. Barney is a sweet, loving fella, good with everyone and he deserves to be in a home. If you are interested in Barney,\n\nEmail dogs@labradorsandfriends.org or fill out our online application at\n\nwww.labradorsandfriends.org\n\nBarney is located in Southern California",

She looks fantastic and is happy-go-lucky! Morgan likes other dogs (a meet & greet with your dog is required). No cats.  \n\nMorgan is especially well versed in her favorite pastime, playing fetch. SHE LOVES TO PLAY FETCH! Give this old gal a ball and a yard and she will be entertained for years to come. And even when she\u2019s not playing fetch, she loves to hold her tennis ball with her. \n\nMorgan is so loving and would make a great mate for anyone who\u2019s looking for a sweet senior companion. She is fully potty trained and walks well on a leash. She is spayed, microchipped and up-to-date on all her vaccines. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in meeting our friend Morgan please email Adoptions@Suncoastanimalleague.org.",

Miss Tea Pot is a very sweet and loving girl who is energetic and playful and LOVES to play with the other dog in her foster home. Miss Tea Pot has great manners and her foster mom describes her as an \"old soul\". Miss Tea Pot would be happiest in a home where her people are not gone all day and have another young and playful dog. Miss Tea Pot is not fostered with children, so for this reason, if there are children in her forever home they should be 8 yrs and up. Miss Tea Pot is not suited to first time dog owners. Miss Tea Pot is not suited to apartment/condo living. She is spayed, microchipped, up-to-date on vaccines, and preventatives and eager to find a family to love!\n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $350 which includes routine vetting and spay/neuter.\n\n***Please note that our first step is submitting an application (it does not commit you in any way but allows us to discuss with you if you and the dog are a good fit). In addition, an important step in approving adoption applicants is to complete a vet check. Vetting of current and past pets is very important to us, thus we will be speaking with the vet(s) listed on your application to ensure that your current and previous pet(s) are kept up to date on vaccines (including rabies), spayed or neutered, maintained on appropriate monthly preventatives and examined annually by your vet.***\n\nIf you would like to meet Miss Tea Pot, please fill out our online application by clicking HERE and then email Kim at KLarimerLovepaws@gmail.com\n\nIf you are viewing this on PetFinder or other venue, please go to our website at www.lovepawspg.org",

I am a very sweet and loving little girl once I get to know you. I can be a little bit selective with which dogs I choose to play with and would probably be happiest in a home with older children, if any. I would be a good fit for an experienced dog owner who is familiar with shy dogs and can help me come out of my shell. I'd love to live a quiet lifestyle in my new home, but I always enjoy visitors! I would benefit from further training, but appear to have gotten the hang of potty-training. I love to play a rousing game of fetch outside or snuggle up next to you on the couch - whichever you prefer!",

I am a good dog but sometimes I'm not the best listener and I tend to do what I want most of the time, probably because I've never lived in a home with rules and structure. But don't let that deter you! I'm a great pick for an experienced owner who knows how to help a pup like me become the very best dog that he can be. I am a medium energy dog who absolutely loves every human that I meet! I like to play with other dogs, but can be selective with who I choose to play with sometimes. I think I would be happiest in an adult-only household and I would love nothing more than to find a home that has a great big yard for me to run around and play in. I will probably be protective of my new space and new people, because I've never had such nice things in my life before! I think I'd be happiest living a quieter lifestyle with my new family, and while I may be protective, I can also be friendly when meeting new people. I would definitely benefit from continued obedience training, but I do appear to be relatively potty-trained at this time. I am not a huge fan of walking on my leash yet, but I just did it for the very first time in my entire life when I arrived here at the ranch, so please be patient with me!",

I am a very timid little girl and tend to be very cautious when meeting new people, probably due to the unstable environment from which I came. Because I'm so scared, I tend to be protective of my space since I'm afraid you're going to take it away from me. I'd be a good fit for an experienced dog owner who is familiar with working with dogs who are fearful due to past trauma. I like to play with other dogs, but can be selective with who I choose to play with sometimes. I think I would be a good family pet, but I would prefer a home with children over the age of 12 who can be aware of my anxiety and help me learn to push through it with loving kindness. I do think there's a possibility that I may be able to live peacefully in a home with a feline companion though! I would be happiest living a quiet lifestyle in my new home and could see myself being very happy in a range of home environments, from a large home with a big yard to a smaller apartment. I could benefit from continued training, but I do appear to have some handle on potty-training. I am very fearful of the leash and will need an adopter who is willing to show me that leash-walking can be fun for me!",

I love to play with other dogs, regardless of their size and I think I may even be able to live in a cat-friendly home. I would do best in an adult-only home or a home with older children who can give me a little bit of space to get used to things and build trust before jumping into anything. I would be a good fit for an experienced dog owner who could help me learn to be more confident and would be willing to work on training with me to help[ me be the very best dog I can be. I would be an excellent apartment dog, as I am already potty-trained and very quiet! While I do like to meet new people, I can sometimes be protective of my space and my people, so an owner who can help me learn to be more secure in life would be excellent. Before arriving here at the ranch, I had never walked on a leash before so I'm going to need some additional training in that area, but I'm sure that I will pick it up in no time! But my absolute favorite activity is and always will be cuddling up next to someone I love on a couch or a bed!",

The staff here at the ranch describe me as \"super cute and squishy!\" I love to play with other dogs, regardless of their size, and I think that I would be an excellent fit for a family with younger children who are looking for an excellent companion to grow up with. I think I would be a great fit for a first time dog adopter and I really could be happy in any variety of living environments. I do think I'd prefer a busier lifestyle, particularly one that includes meeting lots of new visitors for me to love. I may even be the type of pup that you can take out and about on your daily activities with you in public. I appear to be well-trained, and am \"almost\" potty-trained according to the kennel staff. My favorite activity is always going to be cuddling with you on the couch and exploring my new surroundings with people who love me.",

I seem to have some trouble seeing so I can be a bit protective of my space when I start to feel threatened due to not being aware of what's going on around me. I like to play with other dogs, but can be selective with who I choose to play with. I think I would be able to live happily in a home with older children, who can be respectful of my space and aware that I don't always know what's going on around me. I appear to have a prey drive and would probably not be best placed in a home with cats or other small animals. I would love an experienced owner who can help me learn to be more comfortable in my new surroundings and help me to become more confident in myself. Nothing would make me happier than having a home with a great big yard for me to run around in, but I definitely would like to live a more quiet lifestyle with my new family. I do like to meet new people and am friendly with visitors. I would benefit from further training, but I do appear to have mostly grasped potty-training. I love to go on long walks and am getting better at walking on my leash daily!",

The owner has agreed to surrender him. He has been undersocialized so is scared and does not meet strangers easily. Lived with another dog but has had issues with the small dogs in his foster home so we need to avoid that risk. He does go to daycare and plays with the big dogs well. His socialization has also created some guarding issues within in the home. So he will need to be in a home that doesn't have a lot of visitors or understands that Ferguson will not be able to meet visitors until properly introduced. He may be a bit of a case but we still believe Ferguson will thrive in the right home with lots of love, confidence and trust building.",

            "description": "* MEDICAL SPECIAL NEEDS - DISTEMPTER SURVIVOR *\nScarlett is a most precious resident at Satchels, she is adored by all who see her smile. Scarlett had distemper as a puppy which has resulted in life long neurological issues. That means nothing to her, Scarlett is a spunky heartthrob. She's quirky, loves other animals and people. With her condition she has a special way of communicating and is always up for a chatter. In her previous home we were told she was picked on by the other pups but her she has come out of her shell and she is running with the best of them! A bigger, older puppy would be the perfect playmate for her as she sometimes plays with her mouth. An adult only home would be best for Scarlett since her talking can sometimes be a little rambunctious. She does require help with potty training and needs a home where someone is home most of the time. She hasn't caught the hang of how to sit or those basics yet, but she will come to you quicker than anyone you know and listens very well to no! Once you see her spinning with joy for you, you won't want to spend another day without her! Scarlett is 2 years old and weighs approximately 45 lbs. For an appointment to meet her, please submit the adoption application (no commitment) found on our website, www.satchelslastresort.org, and an adoption counselor will be in touch.",

All these precious little ones want for Christmas is a forever home, and at around 4 months old, they are ready to make your holidays Merry and Bright! They came to Labs and More without mom or dad so we don't know what all they are mixed with, but we think they look like Labrador/Doberman Pinscher mixes and that they are on track to be medium to large dogs when they are all grown up. Matcha is looking for a family that understands the time, patience, and energy needed to raise a young pup. We require all puppy adopters to provide training that includes: house training, basic training, leash training, and socialization. Additionally, this cutie is going to need proper exercise, mental stimulation, and your attention and love to grow up to be the best companion. We do not allow our dogs or puppies to sleep or live outside; they must be incorporated into your family and be made a priority in your life. In return, you will have the most loving and loyal family member you could ask for. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting a puppy, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! Please note that processing time for applications is currently three to four weeks. We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs. Thank you for rescuing.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue. Please take a moment and go to www.labsandmore.org and click on Adopt to complete our online dog adoption application. If you have any questions email us at doginfo@labsandmore.org or call us at 858-273-5386. Thank you for looking to a rescue group to fulfill your dream of adding a new dog to your life!

            "description": "*\tBuddy is estimated to be almost 7 years old! Estimated to be a hound mix. This special BOY has special adoption needs!\n\to\tBuddy is NOT for the person or family who has a vision of a perfect dog on Day 1. \n*\tFrom our perspective, Buddy is joyful, exuberant, intelligent, agile, active, and affectionate! \n\to\tSomething we are confident Buddy will display in time - once you get to know one another. \n*\tEveryone has a story... Buddy's includes him being rescued from his solitary life on a chain, abandoned again to be saved by our Rescue finding himself in a very different environment he's ever experienced!\n*\tUnderstandably, Buddy is slow to trust humans but when you gain his trust, he shows his heart to be joyful and fun-loving companion!\n*\tFrom the perspective of a tenured volunteer who spends extra time with Buddy (often off site): \n\to\tBuddy enjoys long walks where he can sniff and explore, get needed exercise, and stop for ear rubs and hugs. \n\to\tHe does zoomies in the yard, explores the shrubs, and enjoys snuggles during quiet time in the house. \n\to\tBuddy interacts very well with our volunteers' calm, well-balanced dog after a slow introduction. \n\to\tHe is friendly as he meets people and usually passes other dogs calmly. \n*\tWhen introduced at the Rescue, he can be excitable when he meets some dogs and people. But he learns quickly as he is treat-motivated to sit, stay, lie down, and come on command!\n*\tTaking into account Buddy's trust issues, he is ISO a furever scenario where: \n\to\tHis person/people (or family with older, calm children) are dog savvy and can provide consistent training.\n\to\tHis potential adopters would be willing to visit him several times before adoption. We ask you to meet him during a walk with a volunteer.\n\to\tHis person/people would be patient and give Buddy time to decompress as he learns to trust you.\n*\tIf Buddy tugs at your heart, call the Rescue TODAY to make your initial appointment to meet Buddy, 803-802-0902.If you wish to meet me, please call the Humane Society of York County at (803)-802-0902 to schedule an appointment. Adoption consultations are by appointment only.\n\nPlease refer to our website for adoption requirements: https://humanesocietyofyorkcounty.org/adopt/adoption-process.html\n\nTo learn more about the HSYC, please visit our website at www.humanesocietyofyorkcounty.org, Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/HSYC.animals/, or on Instagram at HumaneSocietyofYorkCounty\n\nThank you for your support.\n\nPhotographs courtesy of Emiko at https://www.studioemikophotography.com/, Christi Menefee at ChristiMenefee.tumblr.com, and Karen Carnahan from River Art Images https://www.facebook.com/riverartimages",

I love to curl up under blankets, play with my toys and snuggle with my foster family.\nI'm not too trusting of new people but hey, someone's gotta protect the family, might as well be me. I'm little but I'm loyal and strong. That's what my foster mom says and I have to agree with her. I will be best in a home with no young children under the age of 13.\n\nI got the best foster family. They keep me cozy warm in sweaters and blankets. I get yummy food and they really like me. But I'd really like to move on now to the place I'll be the rest of my life.\nSo my foster mom thought I should write you all here to see if there's a family out there that loves real handsome chihuahuas that will be fiercely loyal and very loving. If so that's me, Danny.\n_________________________________________________________________________\nAdoption Donation for Danny is $ 425.00\n\nWANT TO MEET Danny\n\nThe first step would be for you to go to our website at www.aear.org and then to the \"\"Adopting a Pet\"\" page to read about our Adoption Process which will answer many of your questions and then to fill out an Adoption Application.\n\nAlso, please visit our very active Facebook Page for updates on Danny and our other adoptable pets with AEAR - www.facebook.com/aear.org",

Some days I can be \"\"hot n cold\"\" meaning, some days I love to have attention and loved on, other days, please don't touch me with a 10 ft pole. I get along with all other animals but a meet and greet would be best. It would also be best that I be in a home with no children. I need a rather calm house that will just let me lounge as I please. I LOVE going on car rides and sometimes even find myself falling asleep. I'm a special dog, that needs special love. Some what like a sour patch kid, first their sour, then their sweet.

            "description": "The best part of rescuing a dog is being able to provide a happy home for the imperfectly perfect souls of this world! To give the \"underdog\" a chance at a beautiful life. They sometimes come with the very best stories and make the very best companions. \n\nLet me introduce you to Lolita and her mom, Beylita. They are two of the sweetest Chihuahua mixes- who weren't always this way. Due to their skin condition, they have run into not the nicest of people in the past and it took a while for these sweet girls to learn trust. They have been in an amazing foster home for the past few months learning what love is. What it is to always have full bellies, furry friends and hooman friends. Love is all around them now and they reciprocate it! These girls are now so amazing and loving, greeting you with bounces, tail wags, tongues out and bellies up! They look to be friends with everyone and every dog! A little timid at first but once they feel comfortable, it is all fun and love thereafter! They are fearless and love to be around dogs of all sizes, and are not afraid to give off a corrective growl toward another doggo when they feel uncomfortable. It never goes past that-- they just say \"give me space\" and trot along in the other direction, tail wagging! Now full of life and confidence, they can be yappy when excited but simmer down quickly. They are both crate and house trained and ready for a start to their new lives. Mom and daughter have lived all of their lives together and rely on eachother for comfort, so they will need to be adopted together. They are so tiny that two dogs is no different than having one-- double the love without taking up much more space! \n\nLolita is estimated at 1-2 years of age and a CHUNK, weighing in at 13 lbs! Her momma is slightly smaller (also a chunky monkey), weighing in at approx 10 lbs. They both suffer from alopecia. We initially believed it was mange or some sort of skin infection but after medical treatment and different treatment approaches, we have learned that it is what it is. This is who they are and how they will always look-- nothing short of BEAUTIFUL! Convenia injections very temporarily make a difference. You will see some hair growth, but it quickly goes back to the adorable patchy look. It's very adorable, if you ask me! Beylita's chest and head are smooth like a baby's bottom! Their foster momma has also been working on nail trims and slowly cutting back at the overgrown nails they first started with-- huge progress!\n\nIf you are ready to fill your heart with so much love, please don't sleep on these two diamonds in the ruff! Apply here to bring them home https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/19764/generic or email cynthia@threelittlepittiesrescue.org if you have an application on file.\n\nTheir combined adoption fee for both is $900 and includes all vaccines (DHPP & booster, Bordatella, Rabies), spay microchip, multiple dewormings, heartworm treatment, flea and heartworm preventative with 2 month of heartworm preventative for each after adoption, a high quality nylon Martingale collar, a 30 day trial of pet insurance, and transport from TX to the PNW.\n\n**APPLICATION REQUIRED FOR A RESPONSE**",

No\n\nCat Friendly? No. \n\nKid Friendly: Yes! \nIf yes, what's the youngest child you'd recommend they be placed with? Any age, she loves kids and is very gentle and calm. \n\nSpecial traits that make your foster special or that we need to know about them? \n\nWe can only guess the kind of life Poppy has led before coming to GRR. Her body shows that shes been a Mama dog over and over, she has an old injury to her face, and scars on her body. She might not be everyones idea of beautiful until you meet her. She has such a happy and loving personality. You would never guess she has lived a rough life from her spirit. All she needs now is for someone to look past the exterior and see what a special girl Poppy is. She would love nothing more for a family to snuggle up with forever!",

Colby will not need HW medication for a full year! He has had the pro heart 12 shot! \n\nHousebroken: Yes\n\nCrate trained: Yes, will whine initially then settles right down\n\nGood in the car: Yes! Just lays there and hangs out. \n\nGood on a leash: If a prong collar is use, yes. He will pull hard otherwise.\n\nEnergy level: Low to medium. Depends on the day and time.\n\nNeed a fenced in yard: Not necessarily. He would be fine with leashed bathroom breaks and a short walk.\n\nDog Friendly: Yes! \n\nIf yes, does your foster need another dog in its adoptive homes? No\n\nCat Friendly? He is curious about them, but if you tell him to leave it, he will not bother the cat\n\nKid Friendly: Yes! Lived with a 4 year old. Does great with my 5 month old, however he needs to be supervised.\n\nIf yes, what's the youngest child you'd recommend they be placed with? any age, as long as there is supervision at all times.\n\nSpecial traits that make your foster special or that we need to know about them?\n\nOh Colby, we just adore him. He is a fantastic dog that truly deserves the best of homes. Colby loves people and likes to be close by them. A true Velcro dog. Colby is extremely respectful of human boundaries, he will not get on the couch or the bed, but will lay his head in your lap as you watch the evening news. Colby loves other dogs, but does need supervision when he plays, he is on the older side so if he plays to hard, he hurts the following day. Colby is fantastic with kids. He loves my 7month old so much. He will just lay next to her and watch her play with her toys, occasionally licking her head as he walks by. \n\nColby does suffer from skin issues. He will likely require medication to treat his itchiness. The medication is approximately $80 a month. Without his skin medication he is itchy and uncomfortable, he will need someone committed to making sure he does not have a flare up and if he does treating it accordingly. Colby is also an older, large dogs. I suspect some arthritis. He really struggles walking on hard wood or other slippery surfaces. Carpet is preferred for him so he can get around comfortably, or at least some runners so he doesn't slide. GOOD NEWS! Colby has had a ProHeart 12 injection, this means he does not need Heart worm prevention for a full year (he had it 1/12/21)!",
