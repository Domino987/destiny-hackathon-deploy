            "description": "DOB: 1/2014 Weight: 48 lbs\n\nOk....will you look at this mug? Buster attended his first adoption event and everyone clearly fell in love with him. Grumpy face and all, this boy seems to be just the sweetest. He was surrendered when his family moved and decided not to bring him with them. Maybe that's why the grumpy face? He can be very picky sometimes with other dogs, so we think he would do best in a home without them. He also did not test well with cats so would need to go to a home without them as well. Buster also did great with our younger volunteers, but maybe shouldn't be in a home with really young kids (12 and under) as he seems to be more comfortable around older, more considerate ones. Please help us find this sweet boy a soul mate because after all, happiness is a loving home! If you would like to foster or try our two week foster to adopt program, go to pcpoundpuppies.com to fill out an application. Buster has a sponsor. His $150 sponsorship will be used to send him to his new home with a bag of good food picked out especially for him, plus flea and heartworm preventative for the first few months. He will get a good start on a new life thanks to the generosity of his sponsor! ***Buster is on urinary food to help his kidneys. It's about $100 a month. He also needs routine bloodwork to make sure the food is doing its job.\n\nBuster is neutered, up to date on shots, microchipped and heartworm tested negative. He came to the shelter 12/2017.***YOU MUST FILL OUT AN APPLICATION BEFORE WE DO ANY MEET AND GREETS. QUESTIONS? CONTACT pcpoundpuppies1@gmail.com\nOur adoption fee is $150 which covers a portion of the dog's vetting costs. The adoption process includes the completion of an application followed by an interview.\nClick here to submit an adoption application: https://pcpoundpuppies.webs.com/adoption-application\n***IMPORTANT: Due to the effects of COVID-19, our Sunday adoption events at Pet Food Center have been canceled until further notice. If there is a dog you are interested in meeting, be sure to contact us and we may be able to set up a meet and greet as soon as possible.***\nYou can get in touch with us by email at pcpoundpuppies1@gmail.com or by phone at 812-483-4341 for more information.\nWe respond to inquiries and adoption applications at our earliest opportunity, but please be patient with us as we work full-time jobs and perform this service as volunteers. We do our best to return messages and schedule adoption interviews within a couple of days of receiving your application.\nThe fastest way to get the ball rolling is to complete an adoption application for the dog that caught your eye. Thank you for considering the adoption of a shelter dog!",

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in Churchill. He is about 7 years old. We transferred him into our shelter about 2.5 years ago from a municipal shelter in central NC. He was heartworm positive when we got him but that has been treated and he has been on preventative since. He also had a large tumor on his chest in which we had removed, it did come back as cancerous but all scans since have been clear. Churchill is very calm and laid back and walks great on a leash. He never uses the bathroom in his kennel here at the shelter. He is not a barker at all. In fact I have only heard him bark a few times and this was when other dogs were running the fence beside him. He loves all of our staff and volunteers but it can sometimes take him a bit to warm up to strangers. He must go to a home with no other pets and no children as he is not fond of either. Churchills adoption fee is $50. \n\nIf you are interested in scheduling a meet and greet with this pet please use the following link to submit an adoption application. Once we have received and reviewed this we will contact you either by phone or email to set up an appointment. If you have any further questions about this pet or our adoption process please give the shelter a call at (828)743-5752.\n\nhttps://chhumanesociety.org/adopt/adoption-application",

If you have questions concerning a specific animal, PLEASE fill out an application and the foster parent will be in touch. We will not arrange any home visits with any of our dogs and cats until your application is processed. Please understand our foster parents are precious to our 2nd Chance family; without them we cannot function, so we do our best to not burden them with multiple appointments. Our foster parents will choose their top 3 applications and arrange home visits with these applicants. The adopter will be chosen at that time. The process can take anywhere from a week to a month. We want to make sure our little furry ones are placed in their 'forever home' and never have to go through a rehoming again!Well hey there guys. My name is Charles and I LOVE my humans!!! I like dogs too but I just can't get close enough to a human they are AMAZING!!!I had surgery to fix my knee and I have 1 more week of crate rest and then I will be ready to get back in my humans lap and sleep in bed etc... If you want a dog who will be your little shadow and HATES to be alone then I am your man!!!PS my one ear is bent down but my mom says that just makes me even more special! I stand out in a crowd :)Please fill out an adoption application:\nAdoption application (Dog)\nAdoption Application (Cat)\n\nPlease understand we do not adopt out dogs to\nfamilies with children under the age of 5. We do not adopt dogs to renters. Some dogs will have fence requirements while others may not.\n\nA pet is a lifetime commitment. The dogs and cats in our system find themselves there, for the most part, because their humans did not have the same loyalty to them as they did to their owners. We do not take the adoption process lightly, and will do everything in our power to make sure the animal is placed correctly the first time around for your sake and theirs. Thank you for choosing to adopt not shop!",

She has been outfitted with wheels and still needs to learn how to use them properly. Cinderella is looking for a special home that will look past her disability and see her for the wonderful dog that she is. She will need patience and understanding to come out of her shell and be her silly self. Please apply to foster or adopt. \n\nAll dogs will be altered, microchipped, and receive age-appropriate vaccines prior to adoption. Please note that the listed location for this dog may not be accurate due to technical limitations of this database and we have transportation options available within 6 hours of NYC (so don't let location hold you back)!\n\nInterested in fostering or adopting?

He's a little insecure about how to deal with small humans and pets so he must not live with little humans or animals. However, Leo would love to live with a single lady who doesn't have many visitors. This guy is a staff favorite because once he loves you, he really loves you and lets his personality shine! He does the cutest butt wiggle and cries and whines when he is excited to see you.\n\nIncluded with adoption: Age-appropriate vaccinations, up to date heart-worm preventative, heart-worm test if over 6 months, insurance for 30 days, microchip with registration, and spayed or neutered- if not already, a voucher is provided. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete our Pre-application: https://form.jotform.us/asr628/ShortAdoptionInquiry",

He loves all animals and does best with other dogs in his presence. Once he has warmed up to you, he is playful, spunky and frisky--tossing his toys and running around. He tends to get nervous around multiple people which is why we are working on his self confidence. He is going to make a wonderful companion.Please note that when Nykah is available, we are requiring a 6 foot fence.",

I'm a very smart girl, my foster mom tells me all the time, she also thinks I'm funny. The attached video and pictures should show that quality in me. I'm very well trained, and my manners are impeccable. I love to snuggle on the couch and watch TV with you, if it's Animal Planet I may even become more interested in what you're watching. I like to go on walks, but not too long, I like my couch, or if you don't like me on the furniture a nice plush dog bed will do. I do have some fear so I am looking for a forever family that has no small children, and a confident owner that has experience and patience when I become fearful. Please inquire about me, I don't think you'll be disappointed. My foster mom has helped me feel better, will you?\n\n**BECAUSE OF OUR REQUIREMENT FOR A HOME VISIT, WE ARE ONLY ABLE TO ADOPT TO HOMES IN THE NORTHERN VA / MARYLAND / DC METRO AREA**\n\nWe have adoption events EVERY SATURDAY from 12-3 p.m. Please note that not all dogs can attend every event, so if you are interested in meeting a particular dog, please complete a no-obligation application on our website at http://www.muttloverescue.org/application.html OR write to adopt@muttloverescue.org.\n\nUpcoming adoption events:\n\nMutt Love Rescue is doing everything we can to ensure the health and safety of our volunteers and adopters while continuing our mission to find homes for as many dogs as possible.\n\nEffective immediately, we will not be holding our weekly adoption events. Dogs available for adoption can be met by appointment only. Potential adopters should submit an online application at http://muttloverescue.org/application.html. Once we receive your application, we will contact you to let you know the next steps.\n\nWe are always desperate for foster homes, now more than ever. If you are interested in fostering during this difficult time, please complete an application... unless you are a previous adopter/foster, then you can just contact us via phone (703-988-2608) or email (adopt@muttloverescue.org) to tell us which dog you want to foster!\n\nFor information on sponsoring this dog, please write to adopt@muttloverescue.org.\n\nWE NEED FOSTER HOMES! FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE EMAIL ADOPT@MUTTLOVERESCUE.ORG.\n\nVisit us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/muttloverescue\nFollow us on Twitter: @Muttlove_Rescue",

So I was one of the lucky ones to make it out!! \nI am around 2 years old and I just LOVE people!! I would  love to cuddle next to you and keep you company while you watch TV or read the paper.... and maybe sneak in a few kisses too!! \nI love to play ball and tug of war.  Sometimes the volunteers catch me playing a game of fetch with my own self!! As you can see by my video... I just LOVE belly rubs and attention and hanging out and having fun with my people. I am a loving, silly, playful goofball all rolled into one great little package! \nI could use a little help with my basic training.... but I am a smart girl, so I am sure I will learn quickly with a little time and patience!! \nI love people so much and get so excited to meet them, that I tend to jump up on them to say Hello!  So it would be best if I go to a home with older children.  I pull a bit on leash... but a harness would likely work wonders!!! \nPork Chop had a meet and greet with another doggie friend at the rescue and did great!!! She can be dog selective so proper introductions are required and always recommended for any dog. They are not sure if I have ever been around those little furry things you all call cats!! \nSo.... if you think you could be that special someone that would like to give a love bug like me a new home..... please fill out an adoption application at: \n                               www.dawghous.com\nI am totally worth it!!!! \n\n",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\nHello Gorgeous! We believe Daisy is a Great Pyrenees/Golden Retriever, with the size (100+ lbs) and guardian instincts of a Pyrenees. She has very good manners in the house, but prefers a quiet home without too many visitors. She enjoys daily walks and generally does well meeting most dogs on her walks. Daisy is not always happy about meeting new people -- she isn't aggressive, but she doesn't trust easily. She has a scary bark and uses it to keep people from encroaching on her personal space. She tends to accept people more easily if they have a dog, and the second time she sees them, she may basically ignore them. People who love dogs and think that most dogs love them back are often surprised that Daisy won't let them pet her. But she is a one-family dog. Once you earn her trust, she rewards you with complete devotion, and will be very affectionate with you.\n\nDaisy currently lives in a foster home with several dogs, some her own size and some much smaller. She gets along with all of them, though will often find a quiet spot away from the others to take her nap. She previously lived in a foster home with a small dog and a senior cat, and everyone got along just fine.\n\nIf you live a nice quiet life and would give to Daisy the same love and devotion she will give to you, Daisy just may be the dog for you!",

When the guy decided he needed \"new blood\" in his breeding line, he dumped Emmy at the closest shelter.\nWe were happy to bring her to Windsong Ranch and introduce her to a better life.\n\nEmmy Lou has an estimated birthday in June 2010, but in spite of her age, she appears to be in great health. She is slow to adapt to change, and her adopter will need to be someone who is committed to taking the time necessary for her to become accustomed to new surroundings. We know from observing her behavior here that she really appreciates having the opportunity to spend a lot of time outside, under a shade tree, watching over her domain, but she prefers to sleep inside the house.\n\nEmmy Lou gets along just fine with other dogs, but we believe she would be happiest in a home where either she's the only dog, or where there might be only one other dog, so she can continue to get the attention she has learned to love. She is safe with livestock, including chickens, so she could be a good addition to a farm or small homestead, but she is NOT a livestock guardian. She is a companion dog -- a pet who will enrich your life with her love and devotion, whose presence may keep predators away, but who really doesn't want to spend the rest of her life in the pasture.\n\nIf Emmy Lou sounds like a girl after your own heart, and if you have the patience to love her even as she's trying to decide whether she likes you, please complete an application on our website: https://www.bluebonnetrescue.org/info/adoption.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Lindsey was pregnant when she was picked up by animal control in a small East Texas town. She delivered 10 pups in the shelter, but one did not survive. It's really a testament to the care that shelter staff and volunteers provided that they lost only one, as a shelter is no place for newborn puppies. The shelter posted this precious family, looking for a rescue to take them. Great Pyrenees rescues across Texas turned them down because they are obviously mixes, and the rescues were already jam-packed with dogs and pups who looked more like Pyrs. Shelter staff had no choice but to add Lindsey and all her puppies to their list for euthanasia, which would have been a sad day for everyone. Thankfully, one of our foster moms volunteered to foster the whole family, and we were happy to take them into Bluebonnet Animal Rescue. We love our Great Pyrs, but we are not limited to just one breed, so it didn't matter to us that they are mixes.\n\nWe think Lindsey is a Great Pyrenees/Border Collie mix. She's friendly and playful, and loves people. Lindsey has been spayed, vaccinated, and microchipped. She gets along well with other dogs, but can be a little bit alpha in her behavior. She enjoys taking a dip in the wading pool to cool off in summer. Lindsey has a high prey drive and is NOT safe with livestock or cats.\n\nIf you have room in your heart and home for this beautiful girl, please read about our process and submit your application on our website: https://www.bluebonnetrescue.org/info/adoption.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Bobby's mom is a Great Pyrenees/Maremma who has spent her life as a working livestock guardian dog, first in Kansas and later in Texas. Bobby was raised with goats, and had some exposure to chickens, but always seemed more interested in playing with the other dogs than in protecting the livestock. We moved him into the house for some basic training, such as how to walk on a leash, as well as crate-training and house/potty-training. He also got a refresher course in good manners around chickens. He did really well with all of these changes, but didn't really seem HAPPY in the house, so we moved him into one of our paddocks. Bobby seems happier living outside, but will come in the house if that's what you ask. He has good guardian instincts as far as walking the perimeter and barking when he hears coyotes. We think the best home for Bobby might be as a family guardian on a small homestead, where he can live outside, but be allowed to come inside during thunderstorms, which frighten him. He is very shy on meeting new people, so he needs an adopter with the patience to earn his trust. He also needs secure fencing that is at least 5' tall. He hasn't challenged the fencing at Windsong Ranch, but because of his skittishness with strangers, we don't feel safe putting him in a new home with fencing shorter than 4'. Once a fearful dog goes over the fence, it can be almost impossible to get them home again.\n\nIf Bobby looks like just the companion you need in your life, please submit your application at www.bluebonnetrescue.org.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Albus is a handsome Great Pyrenees male who was picked up as a stray by some nice people who took him into their home. Albus is a great dog -- he is good with other dogs, cats, and children. At a recent adoption event, he was friendly with everyone and would let anyone come up and pet and love on him. He is good on a leash, sits on command, and doesn't bark as much as some Pyrenees. Albus is fully housetrained, is gentle, calm, and easygoing.\n\nBUT, Albus has one major issue that MUST be considered by any potential adopter. He has major separation anxiety, and also has anxiety during storms (regardless of whether WE hear thunder, rainstorms upset Albus). Fireworks and gunfire terrify him. Albus must be in a home where one of his humans is home most of the time and where he has at least one other Great Pyrenees (preferably one as large as he is) to keep him company. His new home MUST have a secure 6' (or taller) fence, preferably wrought iron or chain link so he has a view of the world around him. As we said, Albus is a truly wonderful dog, and in the right setting (like his current foster home at Windsong Ranch), Albus is a very easy dog to manage.\n\nIf you have another big Pyr and are retired or work from home, and if you have a nice big yard with great fencing, please consider Albus as your new companion. He is worth the extra attention he needs during times of stress.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Gabriel is a stunningly handsome male with one blue eye and one brown eye. He came from an extreme hoarding case in Arizona where the adult dogs had been left in the field and not socialized with people. Gabriel was the alpha male of the group. All of these dogs were fearful of people in the beginning, and Gabriel was so aggressive that he had to be tranquilized just to be brought in to the shelter. He's still not comfortable on a leash, but at least he DOES walk now rather than fight it. He wags his tail and does the puppy play-bow, so we know he WANTS to trust us. It's just that people haven't given him much reason to trust in the past.\n\nGabriel is a fierce livestock guardian, and is especially protective of babies of any kind, whether it's a tiny Nigerian Dwarf goat kid or a longhorn bull calf. He can be aggressive with people that he doesn't know, so his adopter will need to be a strong leader, committed to taking the time necessary to earn his trust and help him grow into a more socialized dog.\n\nDuring his time with us, Gabriel has shown a real aversion to being inside the house, so please don't think that this is a dog you will adopt and turn into a couch potato. He's also a dog who requires special handling for trips to the vet. He will get in our van willingly and rides well. But once we get to the vet's office, we typically muzzle him for everyone's safety. If we need to do anything invasive -- even something as simple as a thorough ear-cleaning, we usually sedate him so the vet and vet techs can work without worry that he will react negatively.\n\nGabriel is available ONLY to a working home with an adopter who has experience with unsocialized dogs. He also requires secure fencing that is AT LEAST 5' tall. He can go over 5' tall fencing, so if you live on smaller acreage, you either need fencing taller than 5', invisible fence inside the physical fence, or you need to live in an area that is sparsely populated, because it would not be safe for him to go over your fence and engage with neighbors.",

They spent their lives guarding goats on a 9600 acre ranch in the Texas Panhandle and were never properly socialized before coming to Bluebonnet. Petra was adopted then returned to us when she started climbing over the 4' fences at her new home. She returned to our pastures, which are enclosed with 5' fences, and everything was good, until she started going over OUR fences too.\n\nWe moved Petra to the house, where we have a yard with 6' tall fencing. She has assimilated into the routine of living inside the house, and even chooses to sleep in the crate most days, not because we put her there, but just because we keep the doors open on all our crates so the dogs learn to accept them as just another part of the furniture.\n\nPetra is still very shy on meeting new people, but she does enjoy petting from her family. She is not one to bark unnecessarily, so she could be a great companion for someone who lives in town and has neighbors to consider.\n\nPetra gets along with other dogs unless they bother her during meal times. Then, she doesn't hesitate to defend her bowl. She has never been one to play with other dogs, but recently, she has started making overtures to the male dogs in her foster home, trying to get them to play with her. Given her shy nature, we think it would be wonderful for Petra to have a confident dog in the home, so she can continue to follow that example, as she does in her foster home. She walks well on a leash, and is accustomed to walking with one or more big dogs.\n\nIf you think Petra would be the perfect addition to your family, please visit our website to read about our adoption process and submit your application.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.UPDATE:\n\nIn the summer of 2019, Crockett sustained a broken leg; surgery to repair it was not successful, so the leg was amputated. He gets around well in spite of becoming a tripod late in life, but the older he gets, the more difficult it is for him to get up. Once he's up, he moves much more quickly than you might expect for a senior dog!\n\nAfter a lifetime of living in the pasture as a livestock guardian, Crockett is now semi-retired. He has a cushy bed in the barn, and he is allowed to go between the pasture and our front entry area (fenced, of course). After his surgery and during his recuperation, Crockett lived in the house, and he behaved very nicely. But he was not happy living inside, and was jubilant when we took him back out to the pasture. After every meal, we let him decide whether he wants to go back to the pasture or stay in the barn. If he stays in the barn, he has an open door to our front entry area, which he likes because it's more level and thus easier for him to maneuver. From this area, we can see that he feels like he's guarding us against intruders, since this is where our front gate and driveway are. Even though it's clear he relishes THAT job, his LGD roots also pull him back to the pasture frequently, so he spends about half his time there, as part of a team of LGDs protecting our Nigerian Dwarf bucks.\n\nIf you are interested in giving Crockett a safe place to retire and feel like he is still doing an important job, please visit our website to read about our adoption process and submit your application.\n\nORIGINAL BIO:\n\nCrockett has been a hard-working man for pretty much his whole life. He has guarded goats, cattle, donkeys, and horses in the past, and now lives in a pasture with our Nigerian Dwarf goats.\n\nCrockett\nhas proven safe with our livestock and is a fierce guardian. He can be aggressive with people that he doesn't know, so his adopter will need to be a strong leader and committed to taking the time necessary to earn his trust.\n\nNOTE: Crockett is sporting a \"Summer Cut\" in some of these photos because his coat was so matted when he came to use that the best remedy was to shave and start over. He now has a full, long plush coat. We do not recommend shaving double-coated dogs like Great Pyrenees, but in Crockett's case it became necessary.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.UPDATE: In September 2020, Casper's left eye was swollen and inflamed, so we made an emergency trip to the vet. We treated him for uveitis, which helped, but he still had more pressure in that eye than is safe/healthy. With a diagnosis of glaucoma and no likelihood that further treatment would make a difference, his eye was removed. He doesn't seem to mind having just one eye, and in terms of long-term care, the vet just advised that we need to keep close watch on his other eye for signs that he may be developing glaucoma again.\n\n*******************************************\n\nORIGINAL BIO:\n\nOne thing we should say right upfront -- we really are just guessing about Casper's breeds. He is very strong, and pulls on the leash in a way that reminds us of a sled dog. He looks a lot like another dog we rescued last year, whose parents were known to be a Great Pyrenees and a Siberian Husky. But he also has just the tiniest bit of red/gold on the edges of his semi-prick ears, and that reminds us of other dogs we have rescued, including a white Shiba Inu, a Pyr/Aussie mix, and a Pyr/Red Heeler mix. His tail is an interesting anomaly too. It's about half the length of a normal tail; he doesn't seem to be sensitive when we touch his tail, so we think it's possible that his tail has always been like this, or if it was cut short due to an accident or injury, it was long ago and left no residual sensitivity. It almost makes us think that maybe he has a naturally bobtailed breed in his family tree -- some Aussies and Heelers are naturally bobtailed and others have docked tails. If you are as curious as we are, maybe your budget would allow you to donate a DNA test so we could find out what contributors there are to Casper's unique good looks.\n\nCasper is very friendly with his foster family, and he is very affectionate, leaning into us frequently to encourage us to pet him. He has done OK meeting people at adoption events, but he is not usually friendly with visitors to his foster home. He is very protective of his home and family, and must be crated or put in a different room when visitors come.\n\nHe should NOT go to a home with cats, as he will chase them every chance he gets, and seems to mean harm to them, not a fun game of chase.\n\nCasper gets along OK with other dogs, but sometimes gets nervous when a dog who is larger than he is invades his space. He lives in peace with many dogs in his foster home, but would do best in a home where he is the only dog or at least the largest dog.\n\nCasper enjoys spending time in the yard, but he also has good manners in the house -- no potty accidents, no chewing or other destructive behavior.\n\nHe definitely needs a human family who is strong and can manage him on the leash, because HE is strong and can get excited and pull on the leash very hard.\n\nIf Casper sounds like just the dog you have been looking for, please submit an application on our website and we'll be glad to schedule a Meet & Greet where you can see for yourself what a sweet, handsome boy he really is.\n1/30/21 8:54 PM",

Sterling loves being around people!! She loves to play, hang out with people, give kisses and cuddle. She is good with other dogs and needs to have another dog to play with in her forever home. We do not know how she is with cats. She has lots of energy and needs to be exercised regularly. Sterling needs to work on consistently executing her basic commands. Sterling has been working on her leash manners and is very strong. She would do best with children 5 years old or older. Sterling's forever home is required to have a fenced yard where she can safely run and play. Sterling is spayed, up to date on her vaccinations and on heartworm preventive as well as house and crate trained. This fantastic girl cannot wait to meet his forever family who will love and spoil her for the rest of her life!!!!\n\n\nAll dogs we rescue stay with us until they find their forever homes. We do not do same day adoptions. A home visit is required to ensure our dog is going to a safe environment and our dog gets along with your dog(s) and/or cat(s). We require all our dogs over the age of 1 year attend 1 obedience class (6 week session) outside the home. You must live within 1 hour of Birmingham, MI to adopt one of our dogs. No out of state or outside the U.S. adoptions or fosters. Sterling's adoption fee is $275.",

She is warming up to the male dogs in the house, but she will not do well with an obnoxious dog.   She would be fine with a mellow dog, but she is not a dog that will play with other dogs.  Grace has to see you most of the time and be with you. She has severe separation anxiety, so no apartment life for her. She is petrified of MEN, she is more accepting of an older and CALM man! She does not know how to go up/down steps, but she is learning. She has to sleep in bed with you, right near your body.  She is doing really well learning about house training. She has learned to bark for dinner time.  She is fostered near Cincinnati, OH   Not sure about cats, would probably ignore them.  I would not put her with kids because they would not understand her or give her the proper space. She is NOT good with meeting new people, because skittish. .  We prefer an adopter who knows mill dogs. FENCED YARD IS REQUIRED. She has to be adopted no more then 5 hours away from Cincinnati, OH.",

We're not 100% sure of her mix but her body looks Great Pyrenees and her face looks more like a Bull dog--what an interesting mix! Reecy is a big girl, who isn't fully aware of her size. She weighs about 75 lbs and although she is quite strong, volunteers love taking her for a walk. She greets everyone with exuberance--be ready for a kiss! She loves her toys and will play quietly by herself while you're in your Zoom meeting. She may make a cameo appearance from time to time just to say hi to everyone. She will keep you smiling. Reecy is looking for her forever family--ideally one that will play with her every day and continue her training.\n\nHere at NMAR, we don't just find good homes for our dogs, we find the the specific good home for each specific dog. While we work towards those matches, our dogs are safe and happy in foster homes, or in our home-like shelter, where they have the chance to learn some life skills and show us what they need to be happy and healthy.\n\nREQUIREMENTS:  Reecy is dog selective but LOVES people!  She is looking for a home where she is the only pet. Due to her size and personality, she also needs a home with a fenced yard. \n\nAdoption fee is $125 and includes: spay/neuter, parvo/distemper series of shots, rabies (if dog is old enough), bordatella, heartworm preventative while here, worming, and microchip.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting and/or adopting one of our dogs, please visit our website and fill out an application: NorthMeckAnimalRescue.org",

            "description": "**MEDICAL HOLD**\n\nSadie is a NWFLGDR alumni - a beautiful 7 year old TALL velvet black dane girl who loves her humans. Sadie was surrendered back to the rescue through no fault of her own - a product of divorce.\n\nShe is great with other dogs, kids, cats - a social girl and a bit of a boss - but a low key, easy going, well behaved boss. She is currently living in a foster home with three cats, and a lazy older female dane named Penny. Penny and Sadie coexist nicely together their days consist of deciding to sleep on the bed, sleep on the couch, sleep on the futon, sleep on the dog beds, beg for snacks, and/or peruse the kitchen for snacks to kidnap....decisions decisions decisions. \n\nShe has previously lived in a home with a young and older children, dogs, and cats - Sadie was great with them all!\n\nSadie is crate trained, potty trained, does pretty well on a leash, is used to a gentle leader. Sadie isn't a big fan of thunderstorms, and gets anxious when it's thundering a lot. Like a typical dane... trying to get her outside to do her business when it's raining hard will be a challenge... she HATES going outside in the rain and would rather hold it for 24 hours.\n\nAll in all though, Sadie is a lovebug and deserves a forever family. She's got so much love to give.\n\nCould you be the one?\n\nSadie is currently being treated for a severe UTI and slight urinary incontinence that may be caused by the UTI. \n\nSadie's adoption fee is $300. To apply to adopt Sadie go to www.nwflgdr.com/adoption.html.\n\nATTENTION: NWFLGDR DOES NOT TRANSPORT. If you are applying from out of area or out of state, understand that if your application gets approved, you will be expected to pick up the dane in the location that he/she is being fostered. In addition, if the adoption does not work out, it is your responsibility to bring the dane safely back to us.\n",

She would adore a family who loves the outdoors and wants to take their loyal companion with them.Due to Mayas energy level, an adult only home or a home with older children is preferred. Maya would flourish in a home with a yard where she can run and play and enjoy the outdoors. She soaks up all that attention and is always happy.\n\nAll dogs will be altered, microchipped, and receive age-appropriate vaccines prior to adoption.

Guessing she is a Lab and possibly Pitbull Terrier mix. When she knows and trusts her environment, Luna is loving and happy and playful - especially with other dogs - she is the sweetest playmate.  But she is also a talented escape artist: she can climb fences of any height and can escape from crates that are not robustly reinforced.  She does not seem to be destructive, mostly rides really nicely in a car, walks pretty well on a leash (though will occasionally lunge after cars), and is house and crate trained if she gets out regularly to do her business. Luna is currently on TRAZADONE for anti-anxiety. She is doing pretty well and is so lovable and adorable once she knows and trusts you. Luna has STRANGER DANGER when she meets new people.  Her best home is with an EXPERIENCED FEMALE adopter who is home as much as possible, and ideally, but not necessarily) another playful friendly dog, and does not have a lot of visitors to the home.  NO CATS.  NO CHILDREN.  If you are interested in meeting Luna please contact Bev at 804-248-3042 or trampsrescue@yahoo.com.",

When he was a puppy the family thought it was funny that he would attack the uncle and dad when they wrestled with the kids, but as he got older it became serious. Their lack of training Ryder landed him with us. \nRyder will do well in a house with an older female dog, as he is dog selective, NO cats, and NO small children. Although he is currently living in a house with small children he avoids them and they know to leave him alone. He is a little shy at first, and like women better than men but he does eventually come around.",

Sadly they didn\u2019t get a lot of interaction as young pups so now Peep takes a little longer to adjust to new situations. She loves her foster home and sleeps on the end of the bed with her foster mom every night so we know if given the chance she could settle in to a forever home with a little patience and understanding. \n\nShe is absolutely stunning in person and great with the other dogs and cats in her foster. We think she would do best with older children since little ones might not understand to take it slow with her and patient. Even though she has never been a \u201cworking\u201d dog she is always the last one to come in because she makes sure all the other pups are safely inside. \n\nIf you would like to meet Peep, the first step in the process is to complete an application. Please go to roadtrip4paws.com and click on the Adopt tab to find a link to our online application or copy the following link to your browser https://form.jotform.com/53098141083150. \n\n Home visits required for all dog adoptions\n\n We reserve the right to refuse placement of an animal for any reason",

            "description": "Darla is an 11 year old, female, spayed, Boxer/Cattle Dog mix. Darla is very eager to please her human. She loves the beach and swimming, going for walks and car rides. She knows her commands well (sit, stay, shake and lay down). She will lay her head all the way onto the floor when you tell her \"all the way down\". She is a very quick learner. She loves to play fetch and playing with squeaky toys. She also loves getting packages in the mail...she will wait patiently for you to open the package and then beg for any bubble wrap. She will pop each bubble and then bring the plastic back to you.She is kennel trained and will even go to her kennel when she thinks that you are about to leave. Darla is picky about which dogs she likes and doesn't like. She would do best as an only dog. If you have any questions, please contact us at hhfrescue@gmail.com. If you are interested in adopting, please complete an application at www.hhfrescue.org. Thank you for considering a rescued dog.The adoption fee includes vaccinations, bordetella, deworming, rabies, spay/neuter, microchip, a lifetime registration of the microchip, and sales tax. If adopting a puppy, the rabies and spay/neuter will be done at the same time by our vet once they are 4 months old and billed to us. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.\n2/2/21 6:21 PM",

She is crate-trained and doesn't complain about spending time there. Sophie will sit (after due consideration) for the right treats and give you the Pyr paw (shake) since it's the polite thing to do. Sophie loves her walks and play time with squeaky toys. Having a young playful male dog would be ideal for her and would help her burn off excess energy. Sophie has had a tough start, so her adopter will have to be willing to continue her training. She can be very stubborn, she engages in resource guarding (food especially) and she will jump up to play without being invited, including on walks (this last behavior can be resolved with a firm \"No!\" however). She also has some degree of separation anxiety but willingly goes into her crate. Sophie will be an immensely rewarding pet for the right person or people\u2014experienced Pyr owners who are willing to work with her. There should be no children or cats in Sophie's new home, but a young male Pyr or similarly sized dog would be ideal. Please help Sophie be the best dog she can be!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nView full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.\n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.\n\n",

He is a bit timid at first meeting, but warms up quickly. He can be dog selective, but seems to do well with dogs that do not jump on him or get in his face. He does well with older children. We have not been able to find a foster, so this poor guy is having to be boarded at our vet clinic. He desperately needs a home environment with a loving family.",

We would assume Ebony was a huge money maker for the miller based on her beauty. She was understandably shy and timid when she arrived at the shelter but it did not take long for caregivers and volunteers to see her sassy Chihuahua personality emerge. Ebony is tiny but mighty, and she lets her opinions be known--something everyone finds quite entertaining. She does well with the other small dogs as long as they know she is the one calling the shots. Her sweet side does emerge when she is in the company of people that she knows, and Ebony is so cute that all people want to know her.\n\nVisit Ebony at www.hua.org.",

Or as we affectionately call him \u201c Tuck Tuck\u201d\nTucker needs a home with another dog to play with.\nTucker is three  years old whose gentle and sweet nature will melt your heart! \nFirst you must gain his trust as he sadly is learning not all humans are bad and he missed out on that critical social interaction as a puppy. Patience, love, stability and a quiet environment along with other dogs will help build his confidence in a new environment. \nA few of his favorite things are big comfy beds, chew toys, treats, playtime with his foster pack and absolutely loves the outdoors, chasing bunnies out of the yard and snuggle time at the end of the day seems to be his all time fave! \nHe is currently learning how to be a hound, walk on a leash and ride in the car. He is still very fearful of new things, people and places but continues to make progress slowly. \nTucker was dealt a bad hand early in life and we are hoping to find that perfect match to give him the life he so deserves!\n\n** Special Needs - Emotional **\n\nTucker",

I'm a little sad because I love my adoptive family and miss them. You see they had to move and couldn't find a place to rent that would take me. I think people are afraid I would lick them too much. You see I'm a love bug and like to give lots of kisses!! Apparently, not everybody likes kisses. I stayed with my foster family when I was a pup now I back. I really love them and it's been great to visit with my old doggie friends but I really want another family of my own. I have slowed down a bit since my pup days but still love to run so I would do best with in fenced-in yard. I am already housebroken, leash and crate trained!! I love to be with my people and snuggle!! My foster mom thinks that is the cutest thing. I'm glad she likes kisses. :) I like treats too!! I do what I'm told so I can get lots of treats!! If you are looking for a sweet, loving and active girl I'm the dog for you!! But my new forever home should be just me as an only dog. Can't wait to meet you!\n\n(CM/CWEL*)\n\nUp to date on age appropriate vaccines, spayed, heartworm negative and micro-chipped.\n\nAdoption Fee: $100.00",

Most likely a dumped hunter, Reese has not yet known the love of a human or the very minimal amount of veterinary care until now. He was diagnosed with Sarcoptic mange at intake and after treatment and quarantine, he is healthy and ready to start life anew. He's just dying to get out of a crate and get on with it. \n\nReese has most likely never been an indoor dog, so patient, consistent training will be necessary to develop house manners. We think he'll be worth the effort. There is absolutely nothing like changing a life like Reese's. Please contact icanhelp@beaglemaryland.org if you would like to foster or adopt this boy.

            "description": "Cordel arrived at Friends for Life, Inc, on April 11, 2018, needing a new home.  He's been neutered, had been housebroken in his previous home, slept in a crate at night, was taught to Sit on command (especially for food!), and sometimes comes when called (in a fenced area).  He's full of energy and will need plenty of exercise. He doesn't seem to be too interested in fetching, although he'll chase a ball, etc. a couple of times.  He learned how the doggie door operates in two seconds.  He's SHARP and he'll be one step ahead of you if you don't pay attention.  He has \"looks\" that he gives that are hilarious.  He was evaluated by a trainer in April 2018 and was declared not to have \"a mean bone in his body\".  He shares his yard area at this time with 3 neutered males: Parker, a brindle hound/Lab mix about Cordel's size, and Rascal, a feisty 18 lb little guy; and Oscar, a 13 lb fella who's blind. Cordel's history as I know it is that he somehow got a broken leg when he was about 3-4 months old and was going to be destroyed.  A young woman offered to take him, and she and her husband took him to the vet and had the leg set, had him vaccinated, housebroke him, and taught him to Sit.  You can't tell at all that one of his legs was broken.  He needs a home where he will once again be a loved member of the family.  Plan to make sure that he has exercise daily or twice daily, and mental stimulation.  THIS IS A GREAT DOG!  He'll return your efforts ten-fold and be an attentive, sweet-tempered companion that will keep you chuckling for the next 10-12 years! Please go to FFL's facebook page for videos of Cordel. Our page is Friends for Life, Inc in LEWISBURG, WV. (There are lots of Friends for Life organizations!) NOTE: He will only be adopted as a companion, not as a hunting dog.",

            "description": "Fish is roughly 3 years old, breed undetermined. He originally came to us with Demadex mange, but has since been cleared up! He is neutered and current on vaccines. Fish is your typical GOTTA GET INTO EVERYTHING AND TOUCH EVERYTHING puppy, and therefore blankets are a no go lol. He thinks it's fun to shred them. Fish is very intelligent and has learned, sit, and stay very quickly! That intelligence if not properly worked with will get him into trouble. He loves to work, and go and do! Does great on a leash!\n\n Fish needs to be the only pet in his home.\n\nWhile no dog is perfect, as a rescue we try to make our adopters fully aware of any and all behavior issues/concerns so as to set everyone up for success. *Fish is currently working on some minor behavior issues when it comes to his food, he gets very excited and will get upset if someone else is eating when he's not. He has made major progress. While Fish would make a fantastic family member, we do not recommend his puppy antics for beginner pet parents.\n\n*Jaded Paws Rescue is a 501c3 foster run organization, and we do not have a kennel facility for the general public to come and visit. We do this because we find our animals will be much more accustomed to the home environment when the time comes that they get adopted! If you'd like to meet a Jaded Paws Pet, simply email us and we can schedule a meet and greet that is compatible with your schedule. Our adoption process includes an adoption application, a meet and greet and a 7-day adoption trial at the prospective family's home before the adoption is official. Our adoption fees are as follows: Puppies/Adults: $125 Senior dogs: $75 Cats:$50*",

My owner became very ill and was unable to continue to care for me. \n\nI am an active very playful little girl. I love to be loved and really enjoy belly rubs. I get along great with the other pupsters and enjoy romping and playing with them. Just give me a toy and I think I am in heaven. I did have mammary tumors and test results indicate a Grade 2. I would love a home with another pupster to play with and a fenced in yard to enjoy. I prefer no small children.\n\nMy diet is an extremely important factor in my overall health. Mom wanted to feed us the very best diet available, so Peke A Tzu Rescue became a distributor for Oma's Pride Raw Food products. I am enjoying a yummy turkey & veggie mix raw diet now. Mom alternates between turkey, beef and chicken raw diets. Please read about my special diet. Mom adds the following supplements: digestive enzymes, probiotics, kelp, DMG and salmon oil for a healthy balanced meal. I hope that my forever Mom/Dad will love me enough to keep me on a raw diet.\n\nI am spayed, current on vaccinations, tested heart worm negative, on a monthly heartworm prevention and natural flea protection. I am house trained and do well during grooming.\n\nMy adoption fee is $300.\n\nIf you would like to see what our pupsters are up to on a daily basis please visit our Foster Journal at www.pekeatzurescue.com. Also our online application is available on our website.",

Lady needs a very competent and experienced owner, one that has had experience in handling GSD/Malinois/Belgain Shepherds before. She would make a great Police Dog as she has a strong desire to be a pack leader and a high prey drive, and would do well with training and having a 'job.' Lady needs to be an only animal home and is not recommended for a home with children!\nIf you are interested in making Lady a part of your family, fill out an application at www.barktownrescur.org\n\nLADY'S ADOPTION FEE IS $160 The shelter software system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of our dogs we are only guessing at the dog's predominant breed or breed mix. We strongly encourage you to select your new pet by looking at each dog's individual personality and pet qualities rather than relying on a breed label that is only our best guess.\n\nOur adoption fees vary from $150 and up. All of our dogs are up to date on vaccines, heart worm preventives, and flea/tick medication, and will be spayed/neutered prior to adoption. Portions of your adoption fee also help care for the sick and injured animals that we take in. Thank you for supporting us and considering a rescue dog!",

            "description": "Bailey is a 3.5-year old  Maltese/Terrier mix .  He weighs 21 lbs. He was surrendered  because his owner  was not prepared for the energy of a young puppy.  He is all legs and is like a  gangly Colt at this point.  He's very kissy and but is very mouthy and nippy (not to bite, but playful - it hurts nonetheless) but he also has lots of energy and so will need a fenced-in backyard. He appears to be house trained  and crate trained.  Bailey requires regular grooming, and he is not fond of being groomed or having his nails trimmed!  He does not meet new people well, and has growled and snapped at strangers.  For this reason, he requires a fenced-in yard.  He does not like cats, and is picky about the dogs he likes.

He is not aggressive with other dogs, but can become over-stimulated, so would be best as the only dog in the home and without young children.\n\nMonte is a big boy and has lots of personality. He is great with people and loves everyone he meets. You just have to watch out for his whole body wiggle and whip of a tail! There is never a dull moment when Monte is around. Monte will need a home where his training will be reinforced with structure and exercise, and where he can give all the love and cuddles you want!\n\n*Please complete our online application for further consideration.

Biscuit is a semi-feral female dog that decided she loves Wally and will only go where he goes. This wasn't exactly what we planned, but love has no boundaries.\n\nWally is a great little dog that will make a good family pet, but no small children. He does not like to be medicated. If you try to put a pill in his mouth you will probably lose a finger or two. He will gladly take his meds in cheese or dog food. Shots are also a live changing experience. Your vet will LOVE Wally, till he goes to stick him.\n\nWally and Biscuit can be adopted locally in Texas or we can work with one of the transporters to deliver them to Washington, Portland, Minnesota, Vermont or all along the East Coast. Their adoption fee is $250 and transport is $320. To adopt this pair please visit our website www.adoggie4you.org and fill out an application. Meet and greets will not be scheduled without an application on file to ensure the dog is a match",

He would do best as the only pet. He has some basic obedience training, and he's learning how to be good on a leash and not jump up on house-guests. He's very smart and responds very well to treat/reward/positive reinforcement based training.

My name is Kinsale, named after the port town in Ireland. Most people call me Kinsey though. I am an adorable 5 year old shepherd mix who is looking for my forever home. I have lots of energy, but after a good walk or run I love to come inside and chill. I would be in heaven if I could curl up on the couch with you in the evening and sleep snuggled next to you in bed. I am spayed, house broken, and crate trained.My vaccinations are up to date and I am on monthly heart worm preventative.  I am super smart, learning new tricks and commands quickly. I need a family with a nice yard and a PRIVACY fence, so I have space to run and play safely. NO TIE OUTS OR INVISIBLE FENCES.  I\u2019m fast and agile, and I can climb chain link fences when I see a squirrel or rabbit I might want to chase. I have lived with other dogs in the past, but I need to be carefully introduced to new dog friends to make sure we get along. NO CATS!!! I would do best with children 10 years old and older. I cannot wait to meet my forever family who will love and cherish me for the rest of my life.\n\nAll dogs we rescue stay with us until they find their forever homes. We do not do same day adoptions. A home visit is required to ensure our dog is going to a safe environment and our dog gets along with your dog(s) and/or cat(s). We require all our dogs over the age of 1 year attend 1 obedience class (6 week session) outside the home. You must live within 1 hour of Birmingham, MI to adopt one of our dogs. No out of state or outside the U.S. adoptions or fosters. Kinsale's adoption fee is $275.",

He definitely is a lover and enjoys being with people. We would love to see him in a home where he has lots of interaction with people of all ages. He has been good with other dogs  but seems to want to chase the kitties. He is also not good with young children. Definitely would love regular amount of exercise and probably would not be good in an apartment setting because of his expressive voice.\n\nHe is a male, neutered, microchipped, and current on all his vaccines. His adoption fee is $350 and helps Ensure that Valhalla rescue can continue to help dogs in need like Hank.\n\n\nWe are 501 c 3, all volunteer organization and we greatly appreciate you choosing to adopt and not shop and for looking at one of our dogs. Good luck on your search and if you  have any questions 360-559-4972, please feel free to contact us at Valhallarescue@gmail.com or by calling us at  and one of our volunteers will get back to you as soon as possible to answer any questions you might have.\nIf you would like to submit an application please visit our website at Valhallarescue.org where you will find it online application on our adoption page. \n\nThank you so much for looking at a rescue dog.",

A girl just can't throw herself at the first human who comes along, after all. Once I get to know you and you show me you are a good person, and maybe give me some treats (like hotdogs) I melt like butter. And I smile! (like in my picture) I do like getting out for walks, and doing a little running around, but I don't need a super high energy family. I can be quite the couch potato! But since I can be sensitive I would do best in a quiet home without a lot of chaos. So I'd probably be good with older teens who understand I like a slower pace and steady routine. I'd prefer being the only pet princess in the house, too. I am housetrained, and crate trained, and I weigh about 60 pounds. Are you the one who can let me have time to adjust to new situations, and then enjoy lots of love and loyalty after that? Let's find out!\n",

She is just a puppy who was abandoned young and treated terribly on the streets. She needs time to adjust to a new family. She is very loving, but needs a few minutes to make sure you aren't going to hurt her. She will follow Wally anywhere.\n\nWally is her buddy. She fell hard for him when she met him and is extremely bonded to the little guy. We are trying to find them a home together so Biscuit has a better chance of success.\n\nWally and Biscuit can be adopted locally in Texas or we can work with one of the transporters to deliver them to Washington, Portland, Minnesota, Vermont or all along the East Coast. Their adoption fee for both is $250 and transport is $320. To adopt this pair please visit our website www.adoggie4you.org and fill out an application. Meet and greets will not be scheduled without an application on file to ensure the dog is a match.",

We do need the entire party to be involved when meeting available dogs, including every family member and dog(s) that currently live in your home. \n\nGala came to us with 24 other aussies, including her mother and brother, when a producer went out of business.  \n\nGala is a beautiful 2-year-old black tri female who has been in foster care far too long.  She is a great size at just 38 lbs.  She is crate trained, housebroken, and is very loving with her \u201cfamily\u201d.  She is smart, learns quickly, is biddable, is energetic but does have an off switch.  \n \nIn September 2019 she had a freak accident and broke two vertebrae in her back.  She had surgery to repair the break.  Being the determined and optimistic girl that she is, she has recovered nicely and her happy personality has not been affected. We continue to do physical therapy to strengthen her back legs but they may always be less than perfect and she probably will never move with the grace and beauty that she did before the injury.  However, that does not keep her from being a normal dog.  She can still run like the wind, play fetch, swim, hike, and do things like nose work that do not require any jumping.  \n \nGala has been through a lot of training.  Probably far more than most foster dogs would get as she needed a mental outlet for her energy.  She has been through puppy training, manners classes, agility, dock jumping, and nose work.  While she can no longer do things that require jumping, she is able to participate in traditional obedience, rally, and nose work.\n \nHer favorite things are playing fetch, running, and swimming.  Running while squeaking a toy at the same time is the best!   When she is playing with a toy, she trots around with it in her mouth, squeaking it to beat the band and proud as punch.  She is also very food motivated and will do almost anything for food!  \n \nGala wasn\u2019t extremely interested in human touch when she was very young (she came to ARPH at just 5 weeks old) but as she has matured, she has figured out that belly rubs and massages are good things.  She really is a happy girl and her nubbin and grin show that.  She does give kisses (too many sometimes) and has even learned to snuggle.  \n \nEven though Gala has been exposed to a multitude of different people, places, and experiences, she is still unsure about new people and dogs she hasn't seen before.  She is especially sensitive to people and dogs staring at her as well as some movement (people moving from sitting to standing, dogs running).  She does bark at other dogs when she sees them but is friendly with dogs once she meets them.  She does take some time to warm up to people (Treats help immensely!), but we know that she is very capable of bonding with people in a new home as she has made \u201cvacation\u201d visits to other foster homes and when given time to adjust to the new environment, she did well.  She has shown no aggression with any people or dogs. And she loves playing bitey face and wrestling with the dogs in the foster home.\n \nGala\u2019s perfect home would be an active home along the lines of walking, hiking, swimming, or ongoing training.  The injury has slowed her down only a little; she still has plenty of spunk and energy.  Being injured did not turn her into a couch potato. So, while she may not have the physical abilities she did before, she will still need plenty of physical and mental exercise. It will be important to keep her weight down. They will also need to be prepared to deal with any issues with the hardware in her back and the possibility of arthritis in the future.  A home with another dog that is easy going (but not a push over) might be helpful with continuing to improve her confidence.  She has done well in homes with multiple dogs (even small dogs). A home without children is best but a home with older children (12 and above) who behave appropriately around dogs might be okay.  Adopters will need to be patient and understanding and continue working with her reserve with people, strange dogs & situations, and the barking that sometimes goes along with those.   She will initially bond with a favorite person in the home but will eventually adjust to (and seek out) all occupants. \n \nGala deserves to be in her forever home.  She has improved so much in the time she has been with ARPH.  Someone just needs to be willing to give her a chance, even though she doesn't necessarily make a great first impression.\n \n\n",

            "description": "Rex was adopted from SQ Rescue as a puppy but returned after his family moved. They no longer had a suitable situation for Rex and he is looking for a new family. He is approximately two years old, neutered, micro-chipped and current on vaccinations. Rex is high energy dog that would do well with an active family. A FENCED YARD IS A MUST. Rex gets along well with other dogs but is still a little shy to initiate play. Rex has completed a three-week doggie Boot Camp and is very sweet boy but needs a dog savvy owner because he can become anxious and does better with an alpha owner who will give him boundaries and structure. We do not think a home with children (might be ok with teenagers at least 15/16 if experienced with dogs) would be suitable as he can be overly energetic .\n\nAdoption fee: (Cash/Check) $175 (Credit/Debit) $180. This includes vet care and vaccines up until adoption, spaying/neutering, and microchip. If you are interested in this wonderful pet, please complete an online application at sqrescueinc.org.  Incomplete/missing information will delay processing. Your application must be approved prior to meeting our dogs outside of our scheduled adoption events. For questions about the application process, you may call 803.223.9729 and leave a message.",

He won't get out of his night time kennel without kisses all over his face. Then he does one big yoga stretch and is ready to start his day.\n\nNoah's Arks Rescue is all about giving an Abused Animal a second chance at life and to experience what true love is. We take animals that have been tortured, abused, and neglected and supply the emergency medical care required to get them well. We then provide rehab physically and mentally to prepare them for their new home and new life. We are located in Ridgeland, SC., and are by appointment only. All of our dogs are at our Rehabilitation Center either in hospice care or being loved on by staff until we find them forever homes. Please call 843.540.6755 or email NoahsArksRescues@mac.com with any questions. If you are interested, please fill out our Adoption Application at https://www.noahs-arks.net/nar-application. We do adopt out of state and will arrange transports. Our dogs are not allowed to fly cargo at any time.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.BJ was originally named Bon Jour, but her name was shortened by her previous owners. She got the name by being a vocal little lady who said a loud 'Hello' to everyone she met. Unfortunately, when BJ's owners had to go into a retirement / assisted living facility, Baby still wanted to talk to everyone walking by. She had never been in a multi-unit dwelling environment, and her constant barking at all the new and strange sounds, scents, and movement made it impossible for her to stay there.\nBJ is a good girl, she's just vocal. She's very sweet once she knows you're her friend, and she is a good leash walker who is comfy around adults. BJ can be snarky around other dogs sometimes- it's not that she doesn't like them, it's more as though she sees no purpose for them. Diva that she is, BJ prefers to get all the attention.\nAt 7 - 10 years old, BJ looks and acts half that age, and she is generally in very good health. The only exception is that her previous owners sent her with Proin, a medication she takes every evening. They said it keeps her from having urinary accidents or needing to go during the night. We haven't had her long enough to know whether it's truly necessary or not, but we have notice no problems with her house training, so there's probably no need to change anything as long as it's working.\nThis cute lady deserves a loving forever home. She's loyal, has personality, and the perfect dog for the right situation. BJ is ready to say 'Hello' to a great furever home!",

She needs a place where she can also Netflix and chillax! Toys and a kiddy pool is a must for her next home. If you are looking for a hiking friend, she may not work. Unless you take a wagon, she \"pancakes\" when she has had too much heat. So if you are are looking to build your upper body strength by walking your dog and carrying her home, she is perfect!!!\n\n She has been here since February of 2018!

            "description": "UPDATED 1/5/2021\n\nBiscuit's Foster Mom had a DNA test done on him,  This guy is no Coonhound!  He is a Boxer (25%) mixed with several other breeds.  He is quite an interesting mix!  He is still looking for that perfect match.  Will it be with you?\n\nUPDATED 8/25/2020.  \n\nBiscuit is a 70 lb, handsome boy, who is in search of a home free of worry and excitement. He loves the company of other dogs. Biscuit has learned that if you have a dog, he knows you are a good person. He has had a rough past, wherein people and tension stress him out to the point of becoming reactive. A home with one or two adults, who do not have a lot of foot traffic in and out of their home and who like to walk or hike would be ideal. \n \nBiscuit's favorite things to do are go for car rides and take long walks in the park or hikes in the woods. He does well for grooming and rather enjoys a bath and a brush. He likes to chew on bones, is crate trained and housebroken. Once Biscuit is bonded with you, he loves you forever. He will tolerate being around people but isn\u2019t one to go to dog parks or places where others are going to want to pet him or engage him directly. \n\nBiscuit is currently living with a trainer, who would love to see him adopted by someone who will commit to helping him continue to expand his social circle, someone who will be willing to continue his training and work to establish trust through a slow transition. We realize Biscuit is not perfect, but for the right person he can be the perfect match!\n\nAdoption application, home visit and adoption fee required. If you would like to apply for adoption, please complete the online application at www.furryfriendsnetwork.com. Look under ADOPT tab. Please also read Our Expectations prior to applying. Contact generalinfo@furryfriendsnetwork.com for questions or if issues are encountered with the adoption application or general adoption process.\n\nFoster Homes are desperately needed in order to help more animals like this one. Please consider opening your heart and home to a homeless animal. To find out more about becoming a Foster Parent, see our website at www.furryfriendsnetwork.com. Look under VOLUNTEER tab.\n\nPet ID: Amy P",

He enjoys playing with other dogs, especially the girls. Once he is on a leash Persues does well and loves to go for long walks. He is easily intimidated and needs a kind person who doesn't require an instant cuddle pup. He would be happy to just hang out and let his big size look intimidating, even if he would probably run the other way if someone actually came after him. But even though he is shy, Perseus deserves an opportunity to be happy. Won't you open your heart and give this sweet boy a chance and make him a part of your life.",

When he loves you he wants to be with you as much as possible. When he sees one of his human friends coming he is so excited his tail doesn't stop wagging. He loves his baths and will run and jump in the washtub begging for a bath whenever given the opportunity. He walks well on a leash and rides great in the car. He gets along with a lot of dogs (as long as they don't challenge him) and enjoys running and playing with them. Phoenix is a real prince who came as a pauper. He was in terrible condition upon arrival, nearly starved with severe mange and infected skin. But with loving attention (of course, there was medicine in there, too!) he blossomed into the beautiful boy he is today. He suffered so much. Please give him the opportunity to be your Prince Charming. He deserves to have a happy ever after finish to his story.",

This princess likes the water and will play in her doggie pool whenever she gets the opportunity. She loves to play fetch and happily chases her ball to brig it back to you for another throw. She is easy to bathe and is a shiny black beauty. The markings on her face have awesome symmetry and paint her soooo pretty! Even her black tongue matches. Her mom is a Golden Retriever/Chow Chow so she may have inherited it from her, even though mom didn't have a black tongue. Maybe dad was a Shar Pei? However she got her looks she is a beauty! \nLady Gaga is a real cuddle pup! As soon as she knows she can trust you she will be your loyal best buddy. She isn't instantly friendly but gets there quickly. In the beginning she will bark at strangers and seek comfort from her foster mom, but, with a little patience and understanding she becomes an affecionate, loyal companion. She walks well on a leash and rides great in the car. Lady Gaga is a real princess and deserves a castle to call her own.",

She was terrified when she first came to us after being dragged down the road when she couldn't run along the car any longer. She was emotionally flat for weeks and wouldn't respond to anyone until another dog came and earned her trust. Soon she discovered she could also trust people as well. Now she is an affectionate lady who is easy to bathe, walks well on a leash and loves to get affection. She likes to curl up on her dog bed and is content just hanging out in the house staying close to her people. When she is outside she likes to play with rocks or buckets and will entertain herself for hours with them. If you have a big heart and are willing to provide this sweet lady with the love and care she deserves please give her a chance. Willow deserves to have some pleasure in her golden years given that she had so little during her early life.",

She is easy to bathe and friendly with other dogs once she knows they aren't going to hurt her. She barks at livestock so she wouldn't be a good ranch dog. Lightning is quite shy and insecure with people and is nervous in new settings. However, with patience and love she develops trust and becomes quite affectionate. Are you the wonderful person willing to give this girl the positive attention she needs to build her confidence? Won't you help Lightning learn to trust and become a happy dog? She needs you!",

In fact he can be quite protective of his person and so may not be a good choice in a home with children or a lot of traffic. He really wants to take care of the person he loves. He gets along great with friendly dogs, and really likes little dogs. But he won't put up with another dog being aggressive. And he seems to think cats might be rabbits to chase or even tasty chew toys. He likes to fetch his own toys, especially his favorite stuffed animal. Bacchus is house trained and loves to be with his person. He is easy to bathe and likes to ride in the car. He has a lot of personality and loves to play. Bacchus would make a great companion who will be a loyal, loving best friend.",

He is super friendly and wants to be with you all the time. He is a special boy because when he was brought to us he had a sever old injury to one of his back legs. The veterinarian indicates that it can't be repaired so Bran doesn't get to use that leg. But he doesn't complain. He runs and plays and seems to smile all the time. In spite of having been abused (that's how his leg got broken in the first place) he now loves and trusts people. We have shown him that there is positive attention and love available and he likes it! Wouldn't you like to be the one to keep showing him the love he deserves? \nHe is easy to bathe, walks well on a leash and rides nicely in the car. This sweet boy needs to be the prince in your castle. Bran deserves all the love he can get!",

He is happy just to hang out with you. He isn't clingy and doesn't need to be touching you all the time even though he does enjoy being petted and appreciated. He rides well in the car and is easy to bathe. Cabbie is house trained and is crate trained. Even as a mature dog, he is very athletic and would make a terrific companion, especially to someone who likes to take long walks or has room for him to run. He is smart and responsive.

He came to us with a severe wound on his rear leg that required two surgeries. He was a trooper and tolerated the inconvenience well but it did leave him with a distrust of new people. Although Jojo has some arthritis is both back legs he still likes to rough-house with the other dogs. He really likes to play fetch with his toys and go for walks. He is easy to bathe, great on a leash and rides well in the car. He is a loyal, loving fellow once he bonds with you. Jojo is a special prince.",

He likes to cuddle up for some good petting or go for long walks in the neighborhood. He rides well in the car, is easy to bathe and gets along with some female dogs, although he doesn't like the boy dogs. Georgy would be happiest if he were an only dog so he could focus all his love on his people. He just wants to be with you. He gets very excited to go for a walk and once he settles down does quite well on a leash.\nHe has a tough history. The police were called by the neighbors when his owners were heard beating Georgy with 2x4 boards after they had hung him dangling by a chain over a fence. It is amazing Georgy still likes people after that experience but he must not hold a grudge because he is a lover boy. He just wants to be with you. Georgy has a big heart and deserves a good family where he will get the love and positive attention he deserves.",

When she still had Schatzi, she found it easiest to just leave food out for her. She was well loved, but not being able to keep her under the circumstances, Schatzi was listed on a Facebook for-sale/free group site and ATDR brought her into their fold severely overweight. Thanks to her foster mom putting her on the Biggest Loser diet plan, she is now down to 14 pounds! Being a miniature dachshund who should usually weigh in the 10-pound range, she still has a ways to go, but for now 'Good job Schatzi! Keep up the good work and you'll get there.' Schatzi has allergies and some hair loss. Her foster mom now has her on allergy shots which seem to be helping. We're not sure if this will be seasonal or if she will need the shots year-round. ATDR and Schatzi are taking it one step at a time and thankful for every small victory. Even with all the things going on in Schatzi's precious little life, she is a very sweet and loving baby. She is completely housetrained and crate trained, although she doesn't require crating when her foster mom is away from home. Other than the few health issues listed here, she's the perfect dog! Schatzi is so deserving of a loving forever home, but she wouldn't be a good apartment dog. She 'talks' to her foster family by barking and gets very excited when they arrive home, barking many sweet hellos! If you have it in your heart to offer Schatzi a devoted forever home where she will be loved and properly cared for, please fill out an adoption application for her.

I am around 6 years old and know all of my basic commands including, sit, lay down, and off. I would love to find a family with another dog and a fenced in yard. Please no children because I am still working on my manners, including how to greet young people and strangers appropriately. I am looking for an experienced dog owner, someone who is a strong handler and is looking for a lifelong companion that is smart and will be their #1 sidekick. I cannot wait to find my forever home!\n\nBroly's adoption fee is $250 and includes his neuter, microchip, current vaccinations and preventatives PLUS an obedience course at Cedar Run in Hiawatha. Last Hope requires that all animals be kept as indoor pets only, be altered and current on vaccinations and preventatives.

He is a bit nervous meeting new people but once he gets to know you he is a super sweet dog that wants nothing more than a lap to lay in.  Lucky gets along with his foster fur siblings and walks well on a leash.  He does whine in the crate and his foster mom said he does not need to be crated as long as he has a potty pad down if left for more than 4 hours.  He is neutered, vaccinations up to date and on heartworm prevention.  Please contact Grace Animal Rescue if you are interested in giving Lucky a fur-ever home.",

            "description": "Rocky is a big, silly guy that will sometimes still play like a puppy, a very obedient puppy! He weighs around 110 pounds and doesn't always realize his strength and power. He loves his cozy dog bed, soft blankets, treats, riding in the car, going for walks, attention and butt scratches from his people, and toys. He loves playing fetch and tug. It's so cute when he gets giddy, gallops around, and is super happy- he has the best smile. He makes really adorable sounds when you get home, he wants to do something, or he's just really excited- sometimes like Chewbacca. Rocky would do best as an only dog. This guy really likes to take baths- he can be found sitting pretty in the bathroom or even standing in the bathtub looking at the faucet wondering why the water is not coming out when he wants it to. He would do better in a home without kids or one with older kids that understand his boundaries. He is wonderfully housebroken and crate trained. Rocky has been through professional training, so is great on a leash, knows heel, auto-sit, sit, down, stay, and head and hand motions. His adoption will include sessions with his trainer. Most importantly, he needs a patient person or family that gives him space to get used to his new people. It is well worth the wait though because he makes the best companion once he trusts you and knows you respect his boundaries. He can be nervous around strangers and doesn't like to be touched/reached for by strangers straight away upon meeting them. He is such a loving creature to his people, extremely handsome, and provides endless laughter, smiles and entertainment!\nAll SAAP animals are vet checked, UTD on vaccines, spayed/neutered, micro chipped, and given flea and heartworm preventative as age appropriate.\n\nOur website is: http://www.adoptastray.com/\n\nTo check if this animal is still available visit our master pet list on our website at:\nhttp://www.adoptastray.com/adoptable-animals/\n\nHave questions:\nPlease email us at saap@adoptastray.com for more information about this animal or to answer any questions you may have.

Melody Skye loves to chase a frisbee and is a champ at playing keep away! She loves to go on walks and be with her people. She is crate trained and house trained like a good doggie. A fenced in yard would be great for Skye, but she can climb over some fences and should not be left in the yard alone.\n\nMelody Skye is looking for a special adopter who will help continue her training. This precious girl was frightened when fireworks were lit in the neighborhood and as a result became reactive to other dogs. Because of this, Skye needs to be the only pet. Skye has been professionally trained by Tori Roser at Pawlished Dog Training. Her future home would get a free follow up visit with Tori to learn the skills she has been taught. Tori is also there in case her new home has questions as Melody adjusts to her new life.\n\nOverall, Melody Skye would be perfect for a home looking to add a companion who is ready to start having adventures!\n\nAll SAAP animals are vet checked, UTD on vaccines, spayed/neutered, micro chipped, and given flea and heartworm preventative as age appropriate.\n\nOur website is: http://www.adoptastray.com/\n\nTo check if this animal is still available visit our master pet list on our website at:\nhttp://www.adoptastray.com/adoptable-animals/\n\nHave questions:\nPlease email us at saap@adoptastray.com for more information about this animal or to answer any questions you may have.

She was adopted within a month, but was returned two years later due to resource guarding issues. When Olive arrived we withheld all treats and toys and set new feeding rules for her. After working very hard to improve her manners, Olive now eats from a bowl nicely and does not react when the bowl is taken away.\nBest suited in a home with adults only and no cats please.\n\nSmart and Sassy!!  Who doesn\u2019t love and respect a girl who knows what she wants and is not afraid to ask for it?   Olive is all of this and so much more!!   This solid framed, sleek jacketed lady is pure joy to watch as she runs like the wind in one of our fenced in areas!  Paying no attention to the toys scattered about hoping to be activated,  Olive is much more interested in being near her person and in particular getting much needed and yes, deserved belly rubs!  This super sweet, sensitive lady will be at her best in a home with structure and steady routine headed up by humans with prior dog experience.   She enjoys the company of other dogs and in fact, she will tell you her best friend here at the Sanctuary is another pointer, Polly who will oftentimes join her for a brisk walk through some of our wooded trails.  Exploring the sights, sounds and smells of the woods is a favorite past time of Olive along with the reward of yummy snacks at the end of her walk.  Olive is boldly smart and graced with a delightful personality.   She is happiest when she is confident that her humans have everything under control and she need not worry or fret!  Exercise should play a regular role in her daily routine.   Structure, routine and a healthy heap of human love will bring out the very best of Olive.   She\u2019s hoping that soon you will come on by and ask for the ultimate relish, Olive!",

I am told I am quite a looker. I know I am here because life got in the way and my family could no longer keep me. I am definitely a people person and need to be your whole world, so a home with no other dogs or children is where I will do best. I have had very little training in my 10 years, but in a short period of time the staff say I am a quick study. I still have a great deal of energy so I will need a couple of walks a day, but not too long, as I am an adult heading into my senior years. After our walks you can expect my 80 pounds of goofy love to snuggle in your lap or at least give it a really good try.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Because we require home checks, adoptions are restricted to the Los Angeles area.",

My foster mom likes to make up songs about me, and sometimes she calls me Smokey, Smokey Bones and Smokestack.\n\nLife for me hasn't always been great.....\n\nMy last person kept me chained on a very short chain in the kitchen or crated, unless they wanted to use me for a stud dog. Then, they stopped feeding me. I don't really know don't know why they did that to me.\nOne day a lady calling herself a Guardian came and took me on a car ride. My owner told the Guardian that the neighbor had poisoned me, so they took me to the doctor. I was so happy to break free from those chains. Truth is, I just needed food, and love.\n\nThe next day, I met my foster mom. Although she loves me very much, she tells me that I can't stay with her forever. She promised me that she would love me until my new person finds me.   I have never really had the opportunity to be a puppy, so now.....I am making up for lost time.\n\nI loved the kids (3yrs & 11 yrs) in my first foster home, but I I'm going to need some time and patience so a home with older kids would be best. My biggest downfall is that I just get too excited and want to jump and get wild sometimes.\n\nI need a patient person/family that can give me lots of exercise and is willing to set boundaries and continue to work on my manners. I'm a big boy and I like to go full speed.   I am not a fan of smaller animals, like cats. They look like toys, but they don't like when I play with them. I like some other medium to large easy going dogs but would require a slow introduction.",

Bo isn't short for anything; he is just THAT cool. \n\nAfter spending time with the amazing folks at Walden Way, Bo was recently taken by a loving foster family where he has continued to prosper and developed trust. Bo is currently living with a mature dog with a calm demeanor who has been an excellent role model for him.  He is learning to share his bed and toys with her and follows her lead on walks.  He still needs reminders to not react to other dogs on walks, but has shown incredible improvement! Bo is learning to trust new people and he's doing much better now when visitors drop by the house.\n\nBo loves the water and spends a lot of time playing with his ball in the kiddie pool and loves to play fetch in the backyard.  Bo also enjoys relaxing especially when he is cuddling with his favorite 8-year-old human!\n\n-----------------------\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Bo, please go to our website and submit your application http://www.earthdogterrierrescue.com\n\nADOTION FEES:\nSmall breed dogs: $350.00\nPuppies (under 6 months): $350.00\nAll other dogs: $300.00\n\nADOPTION FEE INCLUDES:\n\u2022\tMandatory Spay or Neuter\n\u2022\tUpdate to date on shots\n\u2022\tMicrochip\n\u2022\tTattoo\n\u2022\tRabies\n\u2022\tHeartworm tested\n\u2022\t6 weeks of Pet Insurance\n",

            "description": "Kahlua is a 5 year old female Pug & English Bulldog Mix rescued from the shelter. She is a very sweet and playful girl. However, needs to be an only dog. Playful and Energetic. Sweet and Loving. She crates well but howls briefly. Loves toys but needs durable toys as the stuffed ones don\u2019t last long. She sleeps in her little pink bed (she loves it) on a bed. Loves all people. She is part Bulldog so very strong. \n\nIf you think you would be interested, please complete our no obligation application and we can start the process at www.luv4k9s.org. Select Available Dogs then scroll down to application, complete and submit. \n\nA physical secure fence attached to the residence is a requirement to adopt a dog from our rescue. Invisible fence doesn't meet this requirement. No exceptions.\n\nOur adoption area is primarily OHIO. We will consider KENTUCKY, AND INDIANA AND CERTAIN AREAS OF MICHIGAN, WEST VIRGINIA, AND PENNSYLVANIA. \n\nWE DO NOT SHIP NOR ARRANGE TRANSPORTS.\n\nTHE APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED AND SUBMITTED BEFORE WE CAN START THE PROCESS. \n\nIT CAN TAKE AT LEAST 2 WEEKS TO PROCESS AN APPLICATION SOMETIMES LONGER DEPENDING ON VOLUNTEER AVAILABILITY AND NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS RECEIVED SO PLEASE BE PATIENT. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters must understand that each home is different, and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. \nHomes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for:\n1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (ex. a 4 month old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break) \n2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old, to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise.\n3.) Socialization: The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home.\n4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded tenfold, for years to come.\nPlease do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy. Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time consuming and can be expensive. All Dogs Require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well-trained, well socialized dog is more than worth the effort put in to get them there. \n\nOur adoption fee includes spay/neuter, routine shots, rabies, worming, microchipped, heartworm testing and they are on monthly preventative. Visit our website www.luv4k9s.org for more information and to complete an application.\n",

You wouldn\u2019t necessarily know it at first because I tend to be guarded.  The staff thinks someone may have abused me because of the way I tend to react sometimes. But, despite that, I really want to trust.  I like to go on walks, and runs, but I also like to sit quietly too.  So, whether you\u2019re an active person or a take-it-easy kind of person, I\u2019m the right one for you!  Not sure? Come meet me and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be convinced.",

To save a life of a homeless dog, provide shelter, and lots of love.  We take care of all of the expenses, you provide love. We are a great group of volunteers and would welcome you in our rescue group. Please visit www.eskieresuestl.org and submit a Foster Home Application.  Give us a call at 314-647-1112 or Email info@eskierescuestl.org. We can't save them if we don't have foster homes.  Thank you for considering this VERY important need. Thank you for your time.\n\n\"Chuckie\" is begging for your help!  Chuckie is not available for adoption.",

Her owners left the neighborhood and were cruel enough to leave Peaches on her own loose on the streets. She is not good with Cats , well she hates them, or raccoons or possums or really any other animal like that. She loves people and is very sweet.  She never meets a stranger.  Peaches walks well on a leash except when she goes around people then she wont walk because all she does is roll over for belly rubs.  She absolutely loves belly rubs.  Please help Peaches find a home. She would love to be a part of a family  she is current in shots , spayed and microchipped. Adopt fed is 95.00    She is in the Provo Salt Lake City area of utah.",

He is friendly toward adults and older children and is eager to please. He is leash trained and loves to romp and play so a fenced yard would be ideal for him. Due to injury from a car accident, he has issues with getting very snarly when encountering other dogs, so a home by himself is a must. It is easy to minimize this snarliness by keeping him close to you when on leash and giving pats and soothing words if dogs do come by while out for walks. He is a Beagle, so he loves to sniff around and explore.",

His previous placement\u00a0was not working out as he\u00a0was more dog than the family and resident dog\u00a0were\u00a0able to handle. Remington is active and energetic, loves to play ball, is house and crate trained and walks well on leash. He is very smart, learns quickly and wants to please.\n\nRemington is looking for a dog-experienced home that can give him the guidance, training and exercise he needs and craves. He likes playing with other dogs, but has to be reminded not to guard his resources, like toys and food. He LOVES people, walks well on leash and runs nicely next to a bike for exercise. He likes to follow his person throughout the house to make sure he's not missing anything, especially in the kitchen - he loves Ice cubes!\u00a0\n\nAs he's a large and somewhat pushy character, he's looking for an large-breed experienced home, with or without a similar sized balanced dog. He takes direction well and is fully crate and house trained.\u00a0\n\n***Please note: All dogs are fostered in private homes of volunteers, so to meet a dog please fill out an Adoption Application on our website (http://www.twyla.org/adopt/our-adoption-process) so we may setup a private meetup with the dog or coordinate for an Introduction at the next general Adoption Meet  and Greet (as listed on our website: (http://www.twyla.org/upcoming-events), as not all dogs attend all Meet and Greets***",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Name - Scarlett\n\nNicknames - Scar, Scar Scar, Babe, Monkey\n\nAge - Adult\n\nWeight - 55 lbs\n\nOther dogs - is dog selective/reactive, slow warmer (takes time to warm up and trust)\n\nCats - No\n\nKids - Gets along with kids, but may accidentally bump into smaller children\n\nBackground - Pulled from a shelter\n\nCrate trained - Goes in with treat, protests for the first few minutes. She is currently in her crate 7.5 to 8 hours 4 days a week next to my dogs\n\nLeash trained - Good on leash. Working on reactivity/excitement on leash when other dogs are near\n\nHousebroken - Yes, I manage potty breaks, she doesn't need to notify me\n\nEating habits - Good eater, 1.25 cups twice a day with 2 tbsp canned food (allergic to chicken). Scarlett will sit and stay until I say it is okay to eat. She has environmental allergies, so she gets 2.5 mg Prednisone each morning and 2 Benadryl a day (1 AM & 1 PM). She also gets a medicated bath once or twice a month.\n\nCommands - Sit, stay, down, off, back, out, shake (new trick)\n\nCar rides - LOVES the car. She is the perfect co-pilot and will either sit looking out the front window or will lay down.\n\nBath time - Will go in the shower, not afraid\n\nAffectionate - Gives hugs, likes to cuddle, but is more likely to lay next to you than on top of you, loves to GET kisses, loves to give hugs & kisses, likes belly rubs\n\nActivity level - Medium (Scarlett goes on daily walks 15-20 mins. She can easily go 2-3 miles, but she doesn't require it)\n\nPlay style - She loves to play fetch with her Kong ball, if you run around or chase her she can get overly excited and be a little rough\n\nBad habits - Scarlett can be dog reactive on leash when walking out & about (if you don't correct her right away she will lunge & spin in circles). She has separation anxiety and will whine for a few minutes after she goes in her crate.\n\nRedeeming qualities - She will follow you around the house and likes to be in the same room with you, but she isn't needy. She gives hugs. Scarlett does not bark in the backyard (even when the 8-10 dogs next door are barking or being loud.\n\nBest feature - Her beautiful face. She is treat motivated and eager to learn new commands & tricks\n\nWhat Foster Mom/Dad wants you to know -\n\nIt took Scarlett a few days to settle when I first started fostering her, but she was great once she settled in. Scarlett would do best in a calm house with structure and routine. She has great eye contact when in the house and learning new tricks. She loves people and wants to be near you. Scarlett just wants to give love and get love in return.\n\nPlease consider sponsoring Scarlet with either a one-time or monthly tax-deductible donation.

They don\u2019t understand my greatness. I love kids but older kids are best for my new adventure.

She\u2019s very polite around other dogs and is grateful for the attention she receives from volunteers. We\u2019d love to find this sweet senior a new, safe, furever home.\nPlease visit http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/ to learn more about our dogs. Click on available dogs to see further descriptions. If you are interested in me, please contact us at information@coastalgsrsd.org or call (858) 779-9149. Don't forget to fill out our online application:  http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/webform/1774/adoption-application.\n\nThe minimum adoption donation ranges from $300 to $400. This amount only partially covers the cost of veterinary care, boarding fees, and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs and is 100% tax deductible.\n\nPrior to placement, all dogs will be spayed or neutered, receive current vaccinations, and are usually microchipped. If not, arrangements will be made on an individual basis. Special consideration may be given to those willing to adopt older dogs or dogs with physical problems.\n\nOur adoption process begins with completing an application on-line. A phone screening will soon follow, and lastly a home visit will be conducted by our volunteers.",

She came to the shelter from a bad environment which encouraged her prey mentality and as a result, she wants to go after anything her size or smaller. This means she has to be the only animal in the house and also needs to be watched during walks. She absolutely has to have a certified trainer to help the transition to her new home. Violet loves her people so much that it takes her a little while to accept strangers in her orbit. She is housebroken and very quiet in the home.

I promise- if you just have a little patience while I get to know you- that I am sweet as pie. My dream home REQUIRES a fenced in yard that I can play in with my sisters. Oh- that reminds me!

Her happy place is on the sofa being cuddled by her favorite humans. Zena prefers to be an only pet, but could consider a bigger male canine buddy who has a friendly alpha vibe. She is excellent on a leash, house trained, and crate trained. She also makes a good watch dog, alerting her humans of creepers on the outside. Zena has a lot of love to give to the right family.",

            "description": "Olga is a beautiful, 12-year-old Bernese mountain dog/lab mix of 97lbs who came to the shelter 3 years ago from a bad situation down south. She was obviously neglected and had to fight for herself to keep up with the many dogs she was housed with. This now-overweight senior has a happy disposition: she\u2019s always eager to go outside but will walk just a bit, then sit while you pet her as she watches the world go by: a home with a yard would be perfect for this lady! In a new house, Olga needs to be the only pet as she occasionally goes after small creatures and also takes a while to trust her person(s) 100% during which she guards her food and toys. She is house trained though. Olga has never received the human attention she craves but we know she adores to be brushed on her thick luxurious coat and to share long soulful looks with you with her big brown eyes. If you dare stop, she will offer her paw when asking for more pets. She is hoping to find a loving home where she can live out her golden years. Olga came to the shelter unspayed and due to her advanced age, she will remain that way. All her vaccinations are up to date. Please call 718-666-8097 for more information",

He has been living with a family for over a year but they are no longer able to take care of him.  He is very affectionate with his people but has developed some alpha behaviors that make him feel like he is the protector of his people.  Fortunately, he is a smart boy and he is learning the rules in the foster home in a respectful manner.  He will need a family that has experience with dogs.  He needs to be able to bond with the whole family and develop trust with each person through training.  He needs consistent routine to help him know what to expect.  With time and patience, he will be the perfect pet for someone that understands the nature of the breed - loyal, smart, and fond of children.  \nThe first step in our process is to submit an application for review. Once approved, we will contact you to arrange a meeting at our next Meet and Greet event. Our pets are fostered in private homes and will be brought to Frederick, MD to meet approved adopters.",

            "description": "Soldier is not available for adoption - he is now a permanent foster.\n\nSoldier has been with us over two years since January 2018, without a well-suited application and is a senior. \n\nHis foster Mom has noticed he is getting dementia and we agree it would be unfair to move him to an adoptive home.\n\nIf you would like to donate for his ongoing care we welcome that - etransfer petrescue@hurontel.on.ca - Thank you!\n\nSoldier was surrendered Jan 2018. Sadly the owner, had passed away the Fall of 2017 and the wife had to go to the hospital for her own care. \nRumoured to be 6 yr old by the people rehoming them to the couple in 2017.\n\nVet thinks he could be older- he is guessed to be about 10 yrs.\nThey did need their teeth cleaned and some extracted at neuter, and were also vaccinated and dewormed \nHe is microchipped\n\n** ALL ABOUT SOLDIER **\ninfo shared from his foster mom : \nSoldier is a sweet senior miniature poodle(14/15 lbs) that loves to be close and cuddle.\nHe is quiet and low energy and napping is his favorite pastime. \nHe is fine with other dogs but would rather not share attention so would prefer to be the only lap dog.\nHe is good with all sizes- Size is not a factor. \nHe basically just ignores dogs unless they try to get attention from whoever he is snuggling with and voices his displeasure. No issues with guarding food from others, not interested in toys.\nFenced yard not necessary- but is preferred for his safety.  \nHe is not  a dog to run off but he has some sensory deficits and can wander away or get confused.\nHe would need a leash for safety on walks.. \nSmall kibble/soft food as many teeth have been extracted.\nHe came in to our care with essentially pink fur - which was likely allergies to the food and lack of proper grooming regime- he has to eat a good quality diet and is not a dog who will do well with yearly shots and monthly chemical prevention applied.\nSimpler safer treatment is best. \nHe can become itchy when irritated.\nHe also has the typical cough of a small dog who's had their throat irritated by a collar.\nHe does best on a harness or in his doggie stroller.\n\nSoldier had surgery in 2018 to remove a toe that had a growth on it. He has recovered well but there is always a possibility, no matter how low, of recurrence in the future so monitoring must be ongoing.\n\nSoldier is fine with children, but not a kids dog, not playful or interested in them at all. \n\nI would say older kids are best suited to time - ex. over 6 yrs to avoid any that might pester him. He is not interested in any interaction .\n\nHe did not seem interested in cats at rescue events.\n\nThe Best home - would do best in a quiet low energy adult /  retired home with lots of cuddle time. \nHe is a cuddler not a player.\nHe needs someone that doesn't over-vet with harsh chemical and vaccines.\nHe needs a good quality food.\nHe is House-trained, not usually crated but is fine in one if needed. \nHas low exercise requirements and walks well on a leash but doesn't want to go out for walks - he is a home body.\n\n*******************************************************",

You may be required to travel if approved for adoption.\n\nMillyRock is a medium size, young pit mix looking for his furever home. He's quite handsome with his white chest and hind toes, and this tiny little strip down his face that looks like it spilled onto one side of his nose, but not the other. MillyRock is SO friendly and loving. He's enthusiastic about everything! His eyes show his special soul! We've been working with him on leash walking and practicing his basic manners and he's smart and eager to please. It's fun working with him. He adores other dogs and will play and play and play... I would suggest he go to a home without cats because he is too interested in chasing our cats, but he has gotten much better with \"leave it\" and redirection, so there may be potential in the future. The biggest thing for a potential adopter is understanding he will need some work and time, but ultimately is a fantastic diamond in the rough. He needs to learn that not every moment is appropriate for play time. He needs a confident leader because he's strong and needs firm direction. His ideal adopter should be aware that sometimes he will simply do best in a crate away from the action to decompress....Rocky is such a sweetheart who is just so deserving of a loving home. He's one of those dogs that will reward your efforts with a lifetime of deep, caring companionship. If you commit to this dog he will not let you down. He deserves the same.\n\nRocky is available for adoption through Looking Glass Animal Rescue, a 501(c)(3) non-profit animal welfare organization. Adoptions are subject to review and approval. Please complete an application at https://lgarinc.org/adoption-application/.\n\nPlease note that you must be 25 years of age to adopt and we reserve the right to refuse adoption to anyone. Please be advised that we will not approve adoptions to persons who mislead or fail to provide accurate information on this application. Incomplete applications will not be processed.\n2/1/21 4:59 PM",

Even though we're not sure of her DNA, it's obviously another breed since she's the perfect size! When she came into rescue, she had recently had puppies. Thankfully, those days are behind her and it's her time now! She's enjoying life in a nice comfy foster home, but she's dreaming of a loving forever home and person or family she can call her own. If this home could be yours, please fill out an adoption application for sweet Trixie to consider! She would love you more than you could ever imagine! Trixie needs a yard to play in and a companion animals to be her friends!",

I work on the sites everyday and keep them updated.  Be sure to add us to your contact list on email or we could be trying to email you and it could go to spam.\n\nBuster is a handsome 4 year old Spaniel mix. He weighs approximately 35lbs. He is neutered, vaccinated, microchipped and heartworm negative.\nAvailable for adoption in Oklahoma only.\n\nMessage from Buster's foster!\n\nI am Busters foster mom. I was going to explain a little bit about Busters background/history and current special needs. While more than anything I want him to find his forever home for his safety and others it will need to be a just right fit.\n Buster was adopted out as a cute tiny puppy with his sister. The family sadly did Buster and his sister a huge disservice and did not socialize them at all. When the family divorced they returned Bella and Buster to rescue. Sadly both seem to have fearful tendencies due to this lack of socialization during the critical puppy stage.\n Buster loves me and after a year finally loves my mom and sisters. However when my brother comes over he is very fearful and barks and runs and hides in his kennel. I have tried introducing him to guys I work with and he is fearful Of them too.  I think if pushed hard enough he may nip due to this fear although he has never done so yet as I keep interactions with strangers controlled and limited. I have to drug him in order to take him to the vet due to his fear. At home with a single person he loves he is perfect outside the home he is a nervous wreck.\n \nBuster is crate trained/ house trained to a doggy door and loving to his person. He plays with the other dogs. He is a perfect dog beyond his irrational fear of other humans.\n Buster will not be a dog some will meet for the first time and he will have a connection. He will be extremely fearful of a new person. The way I see Buster working is being dropped off at adopters house and him staying a weekend to see if he can bond. This is where distance concerns me. It would be nearly impossible for me to take him and pick up out of state due to my schedule.\n  He must have a fenced yard to keep him safe.  His adoption fee is $95.00 \n We are foster based only (No shelter) you can't just drive up here and get a pet. If you are interested in a animal fill out the form, not a binding contract to adopt. This is how we get your information to the foster, most of our foster live in the Stillwater Ok. Area.  Application to meet \n                                                                                      https://form.jotform.com/200005720739042 \n\nWe do adopt out of state but we do not ship animals, If you want to adopt one of our animals, you must come to pick them up in Oklahoma.",

She is currently being treated and we're expecting a full recovery.\n\nHoney is a very friendly and high energy dog. She will require an adopter with a fenced yard, so she can have plenty of room to exert energy on and off leash. \n\nDue to her breed, we will only consider those who own their own home as potential adopters. \n\nAlthough Honey loves children, she might be too rambunctious for small children. Children over 12 would be ideal.\n\nHoney hasn't had the opportunity to have 1-on-1 contact with other dogs or cats while she's been with us, so to err on the side of safety, she would need to be introduced slowly and cautiously if you have other pets at home. \n\nShe absolutely loves people though and has showed no signs of aggression whatsoever while she's been with us. \n\n*** If you'd like more information, or would like to meet her in person, please email t.ink@att.net  - or call (239)652-6722 any Tuesday - Friday from 12:00-6:00 and ask for Theresa. \nPlease do not click on the link on this page, or it will not be seen by the people handling Honey's adoption. \n",

            "description": "Meet PAISLEY.  Below is her story and more information about her.  However, before you read, know and keep in your mind, this dog is a LOVER.  She cuddles, and will hug you.  What she wants most in life is to be with you riding, or laying next to you as a best buddy.  \n\nShe is complex for sure,  Could be a guardian, but does not display those behaviors here. \n\nSeptember 8 of 2017 we received a call about two Heelers between Patton and Marble Hill Missouri, laying in a ditch together.  Drivers noticed them several days in a row.  Finally a Good Samaritan found them in their yard and called us. \n\nOne of them had a severely broken leg, which had to be amputated and he has been adopted. \n\nMany things were touching about this couple's story. PAISLEY never left MERLE'S side. She was devoted to him.  Folks stepped up to help them, first being concerned about seeing them but then later when they realized Merle was injured, they called to save his life.  Then they drove the pair to the vet. \n\nTHEN Rachel Riley, a faithful follower, a dog trainer, and a VET TECH, called us offering to foster them.  There is NO taking the prey drive out of PAISLEY.  She also likes a playmate dog but they must be submissive and like to play HARD!   \n\nRACHEL WROTE:\n\"PAISLEY is a very high energy girl who would do best with lots of outside time. She gets along with other medium-large dogs and people well, but needs a home with no small animals or young children or access to chickens, ducks or rabbits. While she struggles with impulse control, she learns new tasks quickly...  ...With her high energy and prey drive, she will wander if left out unconfined so a fenced in area would be best so she can run safely.  Don't be fooled by her rambunctious nature, she is still a cuddle bug. Her favorite place to be is on the couch with you or at your feet.\"\n\nIn January 2021 we let Paisley out of her pen and are working on her being a house dog here. She readily crates, and great in the crate. She is alpha female in the yard. She plays HARD with the other dogs so she needs strong dogs to be with and preferably a male.  Female should NOT be an alpha but tolerant of a hard player. \n\nA bit hard headed, but if you are consistent and firm she listens. VERY athletic. This girl can jump.    \n\nMature weight is between 40-45 pounds.  \n\nAdoption fee is $200. \n\nTo adopt call Marilyn at 573-722-3035 from 9:30am to 9:30pm CENTRAL TIME. Please leave your telephone if you send us a request to adopt so I can contact you! (:>))\n\nWe may be able to help with transport. We ship all over the USA. \n\nYou can help us by sharing posts of our dogs on your FB page and by email to friends. \n\nIf you like music, check out our SAXOPHONE CD that is easy listen music that the pets will even like!  Michael Neville donated his CD to help the pets!  Go to our Website to download single songs for $.99 cents each OR download all 13 classic tunes for just $9.99. Simple, fast to do and YOU get something back when you donate to us! \n\nWant to purchase a hard copy fancy dancy CD (it is beautifully packaged)?  To receive a hard copy donate $20 or more and we will include shipping! \n\nYou can listen to four sample songs at this link: \nhttp://www.bcstrayproject.org/support-thru-music/ \n\nYou can also donate and get the DOWNLOAD versions at the above link!\n\nTo receive a beautiful packaged HARD COPY go to this link: \nhttp://www.bcstrayproject.org/make-a-donation/\n\nDonate $20 or more then send us an email at   ace@clas.net   and tell us you would like us to ship you a CD.  GIVE US YOUR ADDRESS and telephone number in your email so we can ship and contact you if there are any questions.    \n\nTHANK YOU for your support and for shopping for a rescue pet!",

But Blanco has more to offer: He has received professional on-leash obedience training and even learned some tricks. Which is even more impressive, considering the fact, that he is completely deaf (many white dogs and cats are deaf, due to a gene). Blanco is not bothered by his slight disability, as a matter of fact, he is enjoys life to the fullest! Blanco is a loverboy, he is very affectionate and a total charmer. He makes the perfect companion for a person/family who also enjoys cuddling up at home. Blanco loves to snooze and relax.  Like most dogs of his breed, he is snuggle bunny who needs a person/family who can guide his way. Come and fall in love with BLANCO! \nIngrid\n(310) 480 6030\npcdrapps@yahoo.com\nIf you'd like to meet this cutie, please fill out our adoption application: http://www.pcdogrescue.org/online_application.html",

            "description": "This handsome guy was rescued from a Home Depot parking lot late one night; emaciated, filthy, burns to the pads of all four of his feet and a road burn on his hind end. But he is totally OK now!\nHe was placed in a great home with an active female dog about his same size - but he has decided he would prefer a home with no other pets. He CAN be dog friendly, but when there is food or treats involved, he becomes reactive. Better safe than sorry.\nSo NOW, we are looking for a new forever home for Homer -- hopefully with strong dog savvy male. He seems to respond better to a male presence. NO cats. He is great with people but he might be too big and clumsy for toddlers.\nNOTE: He is one very cool dog - BUT... he is not the type of dog you would casually stroll down the street with or take to a dog park. He is reactive to dogs when he meets them on the street. So a home with a fenced yard and some active playtime with his owner would suit him just fine.\nHe's neutered, vaccinated and chipped and is a total SWEETIE PIE - about 3 years old, 60 lbs. and a real goober. Likes to lean on you -- a very friendly and gentle demeanor - He is a big goof. He needs basic training to stop him from jumping on you (or your mother!).\nAdoption fee $250\n\nEmail or call if interested. info@gratefulpaws.org 954-462-8840 Thanks\n\nPlease download an application from our website: www.gratefulpaws.org\nNOTE: Adoption/rehoming fees are applied towards the vet bill: exam, blood tests, vaccinations, fecal, worming, spay/neuter, dental if necessary, and a microchip. There is rarely anything left over, but if that happens, the monies get applied to the next or previous pet - who may have had to have an x-ray, be groomed or have a dental.",

She is very treat motivated! She would be a wonderful jogging partner and would love to be a member of  a loving, active family.  Beatrice is house broken.  If you would like to foster or adopt Beatrice please email hamburgmutts@gmail.com.\n\n\n*************************************************************************\nDue to our adoption approval process and vetting policies, we are unable to adopt outside of the WNY area (within a 60 minute drive of the city of Buffalo \u2013 US only)\n\nFor the benefit of all involved, and to ensure the best match is made for our rescue dogs and your home-life, an application, home visit, vet reference check and adoption fee are required.   Once approved, a meet will be set up with the dog.  A meet is also required with any dog/cat currently in the home and the rescue dog.   All dogs currently in the home must be utd on vaccines and spayed/neutered.  Our adoptions are not \u201cfirst come \u2013 first serve.\u201d  Our decisions are based on the best situation for each individual dog.",

            "description": "Estimated birth date: August 2015\nWeight: around 75 pounds\nIn search of a loving, dog-savvy home with with a fenced yard. Must have the patience and understanding to take it slow and earn Cam's trust over multiple visits.\n\n***\n\nUPDATE 9/2019. One of the hardest parts of rescue is seeing a dog like Cam waiting month after month for his forever home. At the same time, it's amazing (in a dog-geek kind of way) to see him becoming more and more \"adoptable\" while he waits! We are so proud of our \"Cam crew\" ... a handful of volunteers who have put in all kinds of extra time to get Cam out of the shelter--to training class, on hikes, for swims, and even overnights (and over-weeks!) so that he can decompress in the quiet comforts of a home setting. \n\nCam is awesome in group obedience class ... quiet and obedient with commands, close passes and approaches. He has made such progress and can easily be walked in a heel, put in a sit/stay or down/stay, and even participate in small play groups with other pups.  He is far better at calming himself and accepting new people and dogs than when he first arrived at STAF. He is still best when he can have slower intros with new people and dogs, but is perfectly manageable when paired with an assertive, savvy handler. He especially likes the female pups, and he likes them to be assertive, too! On a recent outing, he saw horses up close and he was curious but not inappropriately so. He gave a small whine when passing them which usually indicates he was open to meeting that freakishly large dog ;OP\n\nA few of Cam's favorite things: chest and ear rubs, car rides, hikes, SWIMMING, and cheeseburgers, and will wait patiently (read: sit calmly and drool all over you) while you prepare his treat. \n\nWe have been amazed by Cam's desire for affection and his eager obedience. He has the most adorable way of putting his paw on you and leaning in. Quite the love bug and so fun and heartening to see him gain confidence and build bonds. \n\nDay by day, Cam is overcoming the damage done by years of relative isolation. And to see this kind of improvement *in a shelter setting* (where dogs typically deteriorate long term) makes us crazy-excited to think about what's to come when he is finally, FINALLY united with his forever family. If you're reading this, please come SOON! (Cam says, \"don't forget the cheeseburger!\") \n\n* * * * * \n\nMoo-Woof!  Of course we know it\u2019s not possible, but dang, doesn\u2019t sweet Cameron (Cam to his buddies) almost look to be a cross between a dairy cow and a Great Dane? That might make him a \"Dairydane\":). Well, we actually think this gorgeous guy is a mix of Border Collie and Great Dane. \n\nWe are so, so thankful to have Cam.  He came to STAF from a man whose new fiancee and son were both afraid of dogs.  Let\u2019s just say once they came in the picture Cam began spending more and more time being crated or out in the garage by himself.  We also have some great and very positive feedback from someone who worked with Cam before he came to STAF who is also very relieved that Cam is at STAF. Cam has adjusted well coming to STAF and check out his beautiful beaming smile in the photo that shows him at his recent graduation from training:)  \n\nCam does have some fears while on leash (were never certain how our dogs were treated before coming to the shelter:() so we have found it best to have Cam meet new people outside of STAF and we will would love Cam's next home to take him to a refresher training course while getting to know him.\n\nCam is absolutely adorable and although he can be somewhat timid when first meeting folks and it might take some time for him to become the big goofy boy that lies just below the surface. He's the kind of dog that will love you to the moon and back. Our goal is to be sure that Cam finally finds a home that can reciprocate.\n\nSome great feedback on Cameron after a walk with a volunteer:\n\"Cameron is a such a special dog. He still needs to work on his pulling on leash and sadly he has lost some confidence since coming to STAF.  But with positive base training, a little patience and a lot of love this boy will thank you forever.  Due to his fears and his size he will do best in a home without young children.  This boy loves to be outside of the shelter where he can roll in the grass and chew on some sticks.! \u201d \n\nCam is still trying to figure out where he is and why he is here.  He has made many friends with the STAF volunteers and he makes sure to let them know how much he loves them when he lets out his high-pitched-squeaky-bark as soon as they are in his sight:).  Once you're Cam's friend you will be best friends for life.\n\n****\n\nPlease see our homepage for visiting hours and adoption details. \n\n* All of our animals are spayed/neutered and current on shots.\nVisit our website www.staf.org to download our application.\nWe do not do same-day adoptions; we ask that you return for a follow-up visit before taking an animal home.\nYou must be 21 years or older to adopt a dog from STAF\nWe require a physical fence for homes with children under the age of 11.  We also may require a physical fence for specific dogs on a case-by-case basis, depending on each dog's behavior and exercise needs.\nInvisible fences - Due in part to increasing coyote activity/incidents in the area and the difficulty of predicting how a dog will respond to invisible fence training, we cannot adopt to homes with invisible fences.\nWe do request vet and personal references.\nAt this time, we are only able to consider applicants within 75 miles of Cincinnati.\n",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Cloud, about 4 years old, is a Boxer mix rescued from a North Carolina kill shelter, emaciated and suffering from a life of neglect. She is a beautiful little petite pixie - 40 pounds of dynamite: a big personality in a small package! She's a total love bug and very affectionate with her people. She's house trained, crate trained, has great leash manners and knows basic commands. Extremely smart, Cloud learns quickly and is eager to please. A high- energy girl, she requires daily exercise and stimulation. A fenced-in yard is a must. She is very dog-selective and although she tends to do well with large dominant male dogs who offer correction and leadership, she's not a fan of other females, and has a high prey drive, so no small dogs or cats for Cloud, thank you! She must have a strong and confident leader. She is an absolute JOY, but not for a first-time dog owner or novice handler. She requires patience, direction and a family who will set her up for success and be vigilant in keeping her from bad situations. Her foster parents have worked with her on some food guarding tendencies, which result from her hungry times on the streets. Cloud's home must be exceptional because she is an exceptional girl! She is spayed and up to date on vaccines. If you would like to be the lucky one who gets to give Cloud her happy ever after, please fill out an adoption application here: http://www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org/general-application",

He's great on the leash, loves walks on the trail. An absolutely sweet dog who loves everyone he's met at our shelter! Located at Animal Village NM no-kill shelter in Alamogordo, NM, New Mexico's largest no-kill shelter.\n\nDOB: 11-1-13\nAdoption fee: $225.\n\nPet introductions are scheduled when adoption applications are approved. See https://www.animalvillagenm.org/adoption for instructions.\n\nHOW do I adopt a healthy pet from AnimalVillageNM?\n\n1. Completely fill out the adoption application provided at AnimalVillageNM.org. Answer all questions, provide all documentation requested, and submit your application.\n\n2. Submit your $25.00 application processing fee online using \u2018donate\u2019 button, identifying any pets in whom you\u2019re interested. If your references are verifiable and excellent, we will contact you for a home visit, wherever you are in North America. \n\n3. You will then be invited to visit the shelter, and meet anyone you like. You will have all the time you need, with additional staff to make sure you have all of your questions answered, with no rush. You will be the only adopters at the shelter during your visit, so that you can adopt the pet you choose without competition or stress.\n\n\nHow can I contact AnimalVillageNM to make sure a pet is available?\n\nOur staff is very small, and busy with the care of more than 100 pets. Unnecessary phone calls can delay a litter of puppies from receiving vaccinations, a dog from being given a walk, or cats being brushed and loved.  We PROMISE you that our lists are up to date, and that ALL pets you see are available when you see them. So we kindly ask that you do NOT contact the shelter, until your application has been approved, so that our pets have the time, care, and attention they deserve. You are welcome to message us at AnimalVillageNM.org, we try to answer questions as we have time. If you have already been approved to adopt, we will be in touch by phone, email, or text, as necessary for you to have the healthy pet meant for you!\n\nHow can I learn more about Animal Village NM?\n\nOur No-Kill, Non-Profit, All-Breed animal shelter was founded in 2010, for dogs and cats in life-threatening situations, primarily from kill facilities. We are a 501c3, EIN# 27-4461260, and our financial information is offered 24/7 at Guidestar.org. To see all adoptable pets, learn about our pet boarding and training services, low-cost spay-neuter sister program, \u2018PAW,\u2019 Partnership for Animal Welfare, and our free pet food bank for pets in need, as well as other services offered, visit AnimalVillageNM.org.

As a result, he became \"rescue only,\" and we had to sign an indemnity waiver promising to not adopt him to anyone with children or other animals. This seems a bit extreme to us, as most of the dogs in our rescue program would chase and kill a cat given the opportunity because our breed is prey-driven. However, in order to save Joe's life, we had to agree to the shelter's terms. The shelter had aged him at about 3 years, but we think he's likely more like 5-6 years. All of the shelter employees liked Joe a lot.",

This sweet girl is independent but also a people pleaser. She will do just about anything for you so long as you have treats of course! Don't let her age fool you either, Bobbie girl may be 10 years old, but she still has the energy of a more youthful pup when she is feeling frisky, but she also loves to have chill time, with just her and her people, a couch dog after a nice jog for sure. Bobbie Girl is so well loved by people, her adoption fee has been sponsored by a donor! Since Bobbie Girl is all about people, she wants nothing to do with other animals and does not play well with other dogs. Because of this she cannot go home with other pets or small animals. If you are looking for a best friend, a partner in crime, someone to relax with on rainy days but also make a good walking buddy, Bobbie Girl is the dog for you!",

            "description": "Harvey is a handsome boy pulled from a local kill shelter due to overcrowding. He's a little timid but so sweet. He's around 2 years old and 16lbs. Harvey is a tan Manchester terrier.  Heartworm negative.  He is potty trained although he is in a foster home with a doggie door.  He is very smart and learns commands quickly.  He loves being outside and chases squirrels anytime he has the opportunity.  His long legs make him run very fast and we think that combined with his intelligence would make him great in agility courses.  He is a talker when he is excited but is quiet most of the time.  Harvey loves to cuddle and anytime he gets the chance to burrow under a blanket, he goes right under.  He doesn\u2019t do well in crates but really there is no need because he is very well behaved.  He is the absolute sweetest dog and would do well as the only dog but would cherish a brother or sister to play with as he lives with 4 foster dogs at the moment. His foster home does not have children but with children who are well behaved with pets, there should not be an issue.  Harvey is a parvo survivor and one tough cookie. He\u2019s a great little dog and will Make the perfect companion. Harvey is utd, hw neg (tested below detectable levels) and neutered. \n\n\nAll dogs have a $175 adoption fee which includes vet check, age appropriate shots (atleast 2 sets for puppies), dewormer, heartworm test (if over 6 months), rabies (if atleast 16 weeks) and spay/neuter! Puppies will be altered before adoption. All rescues and shelters practice pediatric spay and neuter. This is essential in our rescue efforts and it is a policy that we will stick by. All dogs over 8 weeks and 2 pounds will be altered before adoption. There are no exceptions to this rule on all healthy and adoptable dogs. \n\nPuppies/Dogs that are not available for adoption due to vetting not being complete can be reserved with an approved application and a non refundable $50 deposit. This deposit is applied to your adoption fee and the remaining $125 is due at pick up.\n\nWags and Whiskers is an all-volunteer rescue. We also have full-time jobs and Families. We will try to answer all questions and applications in a timely manner. Please be patient and bear with us . Do not contact Parkway Animal Hospital as they are a vet clinic and can not answer questions on behalf of Wags and Whiskers. All questions and comments must go directly through the rescue. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION\n\nhttps://form.jotform.us/70898112177159\n",

He enjoys being outside and has great leash manners, but he can be dog selective so an only dog home would be ideal for him.  He is housebroken, crate trained, neutered, fully vaccinated & microchipped.\n\nIf you would like more information about Ogee, please email us at info@barkvilledogrescue.org.

He's a handsome Lab that needs a home where he can get lots of love and attention. Unfortunately he was heartworm positive when surrendered but completed treatment and is healthy. He would be fine as an only pet but loves playing with other dogs. Blue is apprehensive of strangers and can be anxious in new situations with unfamiliar people. When comfortable, he's playful and seeks affection. He is learning commands such as look, sit, come, and leave it. Blue needs a calm and confident adopter that is willing to help him gain confidence with new people and situations. Blue needs a home with a fenced yard.  Est birth date 3/10/15",

She enjoys the finer things in life - like a comfy bed, a delicious meal, cuddling, and playing with her toys. Jelly Bean listens well and learns so quickly - she eagerly works on her basic manners, and will work extra hard when rewarded with a tasty treat! Jelly Bean is not a fan of small dogs or cats, a home an experienced adopter where she is the only pet would be a dream come true for this lovely lady.\n\nBeans weighs 60 lbs., about 6 years old and is spayed, current on vaccines and micro-chipped. She is crate and potty trained. Jelly Bean has been waiting a long time for a furever home of her own. Are you that special someone?\n\nPlease email goodlif3adoptions@gmail.com or fill out an application on our website www.goodlif3bullyrescue.org/adoption-application-1 if you are interested in learning more about Jelly Bean.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Sparten is such a cutie but he is still a timid little pup. He is going to need someone with a lot of patience. He, and his sister, Stella, are parvo survivors which is awesome. He will need to go into a home with another dog. He really likes to go out and play chase in the backyard with his sister. He will need a home with a yard. I don't think an apartment will work for either of them. If he can't go outside to play they will run up and down the stairs to run their energy off. He loves to give kisses and he will sit in your lap for short periods of time. We are working on socialization and we are about half way to getting potty training done. He is crate trained and know how to sit and shake hands. With proper introduction he gets along with other dogs. It is also recommended he go to a family with kids 10 years old or older. He jumps a lot and even though he is small to medium in size he can still knock you over if you are not paying attention.\n\nPlease contact\napp@aarfhouston.org\nfor more information about this dog.\n\nYou can apply online by clicking on\n\nApplication\n\n. Once your application is approved, we will schedule a meet and greet at one of our adoption events.\n\nThank you for considering a rescue!\n\nThe adoption fee includes vaccinations, Bordetella, de-worming, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip. There is a an additional $12.99 fee for Home Again for a lifetime registration of the microchip.\nPuppies cannot be adopted outside of the Houston area until they are spay/neutered after they are 4 months old. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.\nNOTE: In our bios, we provide information based on our volunteer's experience with a particular dog; such as temperament, training, and ability to get along with others.\nAARF is a 501(c)3 Non Profit, all breed, no kill organization. Our group is always in need of donations in order to continue to give the needed medical care to our rescues. Adoption fees do not begin to cover all of the medical costs. Any donation , no matter how small is a big help and is greatly appreciated. Please help us to continue to help them. Thank you.",

            "description": "Bessie Joe is 2.5 years old and has been with her family since puppy hood. At the time of her adoption the couple were newlyweds. They have now started a family and Bessie Joe isn't thrilled with her role as big sister. She will be excellent with older children but not toddlers that will pull on her ears and tail. She has lived with cats and loves them. She is protective of her food so would need to be fed separately from other pups. She would be happiest as an only dog getting all the love and attention. \n\nHer dad was a PB Pyrenees,mom a PB Bluetick hound. Bessie is an inside only dog but when out to potty, she loves to run in the yard and bark at squirrels. Bessie has escaped her privacy fence by digging under but hasn't  tried to jump their 5ft chain link. She definitely needs a secure yard for her to play in with her family. She is a bit of a couch potato(mellow like her Pyrenees dad) so she prefers to be inside,curled up on the sofa or the end of your bed watching animal planet. \n\nBessie is house trained (hits the door with her paw when it's potty time. She LOVES people and welcomes visitors. She is a big boned girl weighing in at 75lbs but she is very gentle.\n\nPlease contact me to request an adoption questionnaire. Bessie Joes family will be fostering her until we find her perfect furever home. They have written a beautiful bio for Bessie that I am happy to email to serious inquires. This sweet girl will be a wonderful addition to the right home,one that fits her needs &  personality. You will absolutely LOVE her!!!\n",

I was dropped off at the shelter and the nice people from PAWS gave me a great foster home so I had a chance at a forever family.  I'm absolutely beautiful as you can see from my photo.  I'm crate trained and don't mind being in it.  I'm also house trained.  I don't do well with leash walking just yet.  My humans are working on that with me.  I'm very submissive with other dogs.  I do however don't like sharing my food with them.  I can be timid around my humans but am working on that.  I don't jump on my humans and I understand that is a good thing.  I just need a patient family to work with me on my trust issues.  I would need a fenced in yard to play safely with my humans.  I'm fully vetted, spayed, and micro chipped.  If you're interested in being my forever family please email PAWS at shoalspaws@gmail.com or visit the website at www.shoalspaws.com to complete an application.  You won't regret it.\n\nTo adopt this wonderful dog, complete our online application at: http://shoalspaws.com/adoption/adoption-application/ Once we receive your application, our adoption counselor will review it and contact you as soon as possible.  Our adoption fees are: $125.00 for mixed or purebred puppies and dogs.",

Murphy would love to have his own family or foster home.  Murphy needs an understanding family who will give him time to settle in and calm down, he does become excited when he first meets people and why we are not sure about putting him with young children.\n\nIf you are interested in providing a good home for our precious Murphy, please copy and past this code  -   \n\nhttp://members.petfinder.org/~MD164/MRR%20Adopt.doc  \n\ninto your browser to download our adoption application, it should give you an option to save it to your computer, please do that and then fill it out, save it as your own name and email it to us.\n\nIf for some reason you cannot download our application please email terry4553@verizon.net and I will send it to you.\n\nWe do not allow meetings with any of our dogs until we have your adoption application. \n \n Please know because we are so very busy with the dogs along with processing applications, updating webpage\u2019s etc we are not able to return phone calls asking if this dog is still adoptable.  We update our sites regularly so if the dog is listed here they are in fact adoptable.  Our coverage is limited to: MD, DE and the Southeastern parts of PA, and NJ \n \nPlease fill out our adoption application and send to us.  If you have questions our adoption process is located on the front page of our petfinder site and should answer all your questions, if after submitting your application and reading our process, you still have questions, please email Terry at terry4553@verizon.net   Thank you",

But he struggles with symptoms like incontinence and is prone to infections. The severity of symptoms of Spina Bifida can have a wide range and varies from dog to dog.\n\nWe are committed to giving Brody the best care possible, and finding him a home that can help him live his life to its full potential. His condition is manageable, but still costly. On top of his medical care, he requires several diaper changes a day to stay clean. He also needs balanced diet and daily supplements to avoid any infections. His adoption fee is $350. This includes my neuter surgery, vaccines, deworming, microchip with registration, free wellness exam, and 30 Days of Pet Insurance. To find out how you can meet me, start by completing an adoption application online at www.ruffpatchrescue.com.",

He would do best as the only dog as he gets jealous and does not want to share his person. \n\nHe is in a small shelter in Lytle, TX and can be transported to your area once adopted. His adoption fee is $200 and transport fee is $185. If you are interested in adopting Caleb, please contact Lytle Animal Care and Control at 830-709-3832 and request an application.",

I know there are a lot of dogs that look like me needing responsible loving homes but I'm special! Everyone tells me I'm special so it must be true. \nI've learned to trust people and they also tell me I'm very beautiful -- that I know is true!\nMy family loves me and they saved me from death row at a local shelter. Before that, I wasn't treated well; no one taught me anything until I came here. I want to thank the people who saved me from the shelter because I know I'll find my special family. They promised to keep me safe and help me.\nThe best home for me will be without other pets. I also like older children. I'm still in training but I promise to try my best! I'm very smart and I want to please you. \nI love to play ball! It's so much fun to chase my ball through the leaves and run in my secure yard. I really like it when people tell me I'm a good dog! My trainer wants to help me in my new home, too. I think I'd like to learn agility games because I'm a high-energy dog that loves attention. If someone gave me belly rubs all day, that wouldn't bother me at all! \n\nGoldie is housetrained and crate trained; she walks well on a leash and is familiar with basic obedience. Goldie is spayed, current on vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative. Goldie was born in 2017 and is approximately 58 pounds. She loves people!\nSometimes, a loving devoted home is not the right fit for a dog and we are sponsoring Goldie to help her family find her a new home -- a home that meets all of Goldie's needs. No other pets; no children younger than 12 years old. Large secure yard. Home visit required; adoption contribution negotiable. To learn more about Goldie, contact us at SacredPawsDogs@gmail.com\n",

            "description": "This boy Bumble has so much soul, you can see it in his eyes. He is the sweetest snuggle bug there ever was! His name suits him well he loves to buzz around just like the busy bees. His approximate DOB is 7/17/17. He is a big pitty mix weighing in at 80 pounds. He was rescued a few years ago from an abusive situation where he was believed to be kicked so hard his right rear leg was fractured and he had to have FHO surgery. In learning to walk again he over compensated and now has reversed pigeon toe (as you can see in the photos), we find it cute. This doesn\u2019t slow him down at all. He runs as fast a lightning when in open free space, and loves to go on walks. Bumble was adopted and returned at no fault of his own after a few years. In this home he didn\u2019t have to share his space with other dogs and prefers to be the only dog in the home. Bumble does well with older children, we recommend 14 years and older. Bumble is such a smart boy! He is house broke, and knows basic commands and also \u201cwait\u201d for his treat. Bumble HATES the crate and would do best in a home where that isn\u2019t necessary. He LOVES to play with toys and will bring them to you when he wants to play. But his favorite thing to do it snuggle and get belly rubs from his people. Due to his abusive past Bumble needs a family that understands that he needs time to settle in and will give him time to decompress and learn that he is in a safe place. Once he trusts you he is the most loving, fun, playful, best friend you can ask for. Please fill out an application if you think Bumble would make a great addition to your family.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our animals, please complete an application from our website at www.josephslegacyrescue.org \n\nSomeone will contact you to discuss the adoption process and set up a meet and greet with the animal you are interested in.  All potential adopters will be subject to a home visit.\n\nPuppies (under 12 months) -  $300*\nDog (12 months and older)  - $200*\nSenior Dogs - $100*\n\nAll Canines are HW tested (if over 6 months old), vaccinated, dewormed, microchipped, spayed/neutered, rabies vaccine, Bordetella vaccine, are on monthly flea and heartworm prevention, and also have a current Butler County dog license.\n\n*Joseph's Legacy reserves the right to raise or lower adoption fees on certain animals. These adjusted fees will normally be added to the individual animal's profile. If there are any concerns about the adoption fee please verify with the adoption coordinator that has contacted you.",

She knows lots of tricks, like sit, paw, other paw, and lie down! She is a very sweet girl. She is a little shy of men, but with patience will warm up to them as well. \n\nAll adult dogs have been spayed/neutered, microchipped, wormed, heartworm tested, receive heartworm preventative, and are current on shots, including canine flu vaccine. Puppies are current on shots and wormed.  They will be spayed/neutered and microchipped once they become of age.\n\nSee our website for hours, fees and directions to come visit!",

            "description": "***EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE REQUIRED***\n\nTesla is a beautiful girl with a loving personality.  She loves most humans she meets (often afraid of new men) and will greet them with smiles and her classic \"wiggle butt\".  Tesla has a sweet, nurturing side to her wherein she loves to cuddle with her foster family & is a perfect \"Netflix and Chill\" Saturday night date. \n\nTesla has been around older kids and we believe she'd do best with respectful dog savvy kids ages 13 years and older.  No small kids for Tesla. \n\nTesla is a dog that requires structure and boundaries. She requires an experienced handler, specifically one that has experience handling reactive dogs.  Tesla has shown increased reactivity to other dogs while on walks with her foster dad. \n\nDue to her high prey/game drive, cats or other any other animals in the home are a hard no for Tesla.  She loves to chase rabbits, squirrels and chipmunks.  Tesla's rescue journey has been a long one and she's more than ready to settle into a home of her own. \n\nTesla requires a home without kids and other animals. \n\nFor more information on Tesla, or to determine if she'd be the right fit for your home, email: Beth@4pitssakerescue.com\n\nTo view Tesla's full bio, visit: www.4pitssakerescue.com\n\n",

            "description": "Forever in Foster CareReina will be a forever foster in DRM's Program, however we would work with the right forever home for this sweet girl.\n\nMeet Reina! This girl is just 3 years old and is handicapable!\n\nReina was originally rescued from a high kill shelter by an all breed rescue. It was apparent she suffered from neurological issues, but nothing could be found on x-rays of her spine. DRM then stepped in and welcomed Reina into our program to get the help needed so she can thrive!\n\nReina was born with a condition that caused the nerves from her back legs to brain to not map completely. Sometimes she can be a bit wobbly and sometimes she suffers from incontinence. She is on a special diet that has helped a lot with her potty issues though!\n\nReina's favorite activities include snuggling her humans, chewing on bones, going for walks, playdates with her friends and exploring the yard. She also LOVES to chase rabbits and squirrels! When she's tuckered out, she'll sunbathe looking out the window or hang out with her foster family.\n\nReina has lived with other dogs and cats - she's awesome with dogs but can be very curious about her feline friends. Reina is super smart and knows all the basic commands. Her recall is great (as long as she's not scouting for bunnies or squirrels) and she is very food motivated to learn anything else you'd like to teach her. She is a hit around the neighborhood with her sunny disposition and love of everyone she meets.\n\nReina would do best in a home where someone would be home with her most of the day - she loves to snuggle! She loves everyone she meets so she's not picky - she just needs someone to make her world complete. Could that be you?\n\nThis fabulous foster is a Doberman Rescue Minnesota foster dog.\n\nPlease read all adoption steps and policies carefully on our website. http://dobermanrescueminnesota.com/adoption-steps/\n\nQualified adopters are within the approved adoption area, and Adopter will be requested to visit this foster dog at the foster family home. Our foster families are generally located within a 250 mile radius of Minneapolis, MN.\n\nAll DRM dogs are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, health checked, microchipped, dewormed, 4DX tested, and on monthly flea/tick and heartworm prevention.",

She is crate trained and walks like a lady on the leash. Greta loves to go for car rides, loves long walks and is a petite girl. She bonds quickly with her people and is an affectionate girl. She can be quite shy and a bit nervous around new people so a home that is quiet without many visitors would be ideal. She will need to be the only pet in the home but she has so much love to give. Her ideal adopter would be able to take the time to do several meet and greet with her to get to know her and gain her trust.",

You know the best news about that? I am ready for adoption!! Yes, I am an older girl, but have much more love left to give. Just ask my foster parents. They say I am good as gold and fit as a fiddle Sorry, I love idioms.\nI am a good all around mature gal and get around just fine. I have good energy levels and my personality is shining through. I have a few lingering dental issues, but they don't really interfere with anything. I like people, other dogs, and am good in my crate. I will even use a doggie door! These days I am happy, healthy and like attention just like my dog roommates. If you are looking for an older lady, with some pep in her step (sorry, just one more idiom), I just might be your gal. I promise to repay you with lots of affection and tail wagging. So, how 'bout it, want to bring me home?\n9/24/18\nCarolina Basset Hound Rescue adopts in North and South Carolina.

This could change, but for now we think it best she go to a quieter home.

Sometimes I get a little nervous meeting new dogs when I'm on a leash, but I've been working hard and come a long way! I need a family that can help me continue to learn and make the right decisions. \n\nMy adoption fee is $200. This includes my neuter surgery, vaccines, deworming, microchip with registration, free wellness exam, and 30 Days of Pet Insurance.\n\nTo find out how you can meet me, start by completing an adoption application online at www.ruffpatchrescue.com. You can attend one of our adoption events held most Saturdays, 10am to 1pm at the Riverton Petsmart.",

            "description": "Clover (Buddy) is a gorgeous 3 1/2 year old Cocker Spaniel/Shi tzu mix who needs a new forever home!\u00a0 He also responds to the name \u201cBuddy\u201d.\n\nClover just loves a nice long walk with a person he loves. He is a curious boy and enjoys sightseeing during his walks.\n\nClover attaches quickly to one person and is fearful of those he doesn't know. He has shown some protectiveness over his previous owner.\u00a0 We recommend he be the only pet in the home.\n\nClover lights up when it's time to play!\u00a0 He has a blast playing with his toys and can be protective of them as well.\u00a0 A potential adopter would need to visit several times in order to win his trust and get to know him.\n\nThis pup has so much potential if given the time and patience that he needs.\u00a0 An adopter would need to commit to working with a trainer as needed to help him build his confidence and learn to trust others.\u00a0 Due to his special needs, we are only seeking a local adopter who lives in a single family house.  Clover will do best in an adults only home.\n\nClover is neutered, microchipped, heart worm free, approximately 30 pounds, and up to date on all vaccines. If you\u2019d like to meet this handsome boy, please download our adoption application and email it to adopt@bobbicares.org to arrange a visit appointment. Kindly keep in mind that all of our adoptions are local only (Long Island, Queens, Brooklyn, Manhattan).",

A neighbor brought this little puppy to me on Friday, 1/19/18, at around 5:00 p.m., and said the puppy was traveling the road with an adult male dog that looked similar to the puppy, but the puppy came to him in his yard while the other dog kept going. I put some food down for him, and he ate like he was starving. I gave him the name Brody.\n\nOn Saturday, 1/20/18, I noticed that he did not stir while sleeping no matter what the noise was. I was able to get him in to the Gresham Veterinary Hospital on Tuesday, 1/23/18, to get vaccinated, and check his inner ears since he can bark. We had a Yellow Lab years ago that was born deaf, and made noises instead of barking. The puppie's ears looked good, he weighed 10.6 pounds, and was estimated to be 10 weeks old, so date of birth is around November 14, 2017.  Brody was neutered on 2/17/18, weighed 21.6 pounds, and still growing.  As of 5/10/20, he is 93 pounds.\n\nBrody is very playful, does not like to be by himself, and will be vocal about it.  He requires a fenced yard, and another dog that can hear to guide him and play with him.  Vehicles should not be moved around him without knowing where he is, and he is not an apartment dog.  I am working on house training him, and he is doing good.  He is crate trained, and likes sleeping on a dog bed in his crate.  His fur is very soft, and he loves attention from people.\n\nAdoption fee is $80, which includes his neuter and vaccinations.",

Her prior history is unknown, but she has lived most of her life with us. When she first arrived at our organization she was misdiagnosed. We were told she had Wobblers and that was the reason why she walked the way she did. Upon further examination, it was determined that she had horrible knees and hips. She has undergone three knee surgeries so far and is doing great, still not a perfect gait, but pain free. When her MRI came back, it was explained that her brain wasn't fully developed so there is a delay in what she is seeing until she understands what she is looking at. So fast movements and over excitement is usually too much stimuli for her. She loves to play and sometimes too much so we watch her to make sure the other dogs are not getting annoyed, and she loves her people. But can be leary around strangers especially if they approach too fast. She will get mouthy if nervous. She is a big girl, about 80 pounds. Great with routine and structure. Overall just a huge Goober! Such a sweet personality and so much fun.",

I haven't run a marathon yet but my running skills are definitely gold medal material. If you're an avid runner, we're made for each other! I get a little nervous meeting new people so I'm hoping to find a home that will help me stick to a comfortable greeting routine with guests. Once I know you, though, I'm all about snuggles. I'm good with kids and a variety of other animals, including pigs and goats. I'm looking for a confident, experienced owner who can help me channel my enthusiasm into fun activities. \n\nMy adoption fee is $200. This includes my neuter surgery, vaccines, deworming, microchip with registration, free wellness exam, and 30 Days of Pet Insurance.\n\nTo find out how you can meet me, start by completing an adoption application online at www.ruffpatchrescue.com. You can attend one of our adoption events held most Saturdays, 10am to 1pm at the Riverton Petsmart.",

When he's out in the yard, he becomes a black and white blur that is unstoppable. Radcliff is smart, handsome and so excited to show all his skills to his new family. Radcliff is aptly named after the street where he was found by some Good Samaritans. His original family had left him there, and by a stroke of luck he was found. They brought Radcliff to Adopt-A-Dog in the hopes of finding him a home, and we are more than ready to do so. Everyone who has met Radcliff so far is impressed by his combination of energy and affection and is sure he will impress his forever family just as much. Radcliff has a bunch of his basic obedience down pat, and is more than able to pick up on any training set before him. He is quite energetic but having fetch be his favorite game makes it easy to tire him out (for a few hours at least!). Radcliff is a gem just waiting to be found by his new family!\n\nFor more information, please call us at (914) 273-1674 or email us at adoptions@adoptadog.org.\n\nThe first step to adopting one of our dogs is to fill out our online adoptions questionnaire located here: https://forms.gle/5heEH8S6c7zXBneD7",

He was picked up as a stray in Georgia and has made his way to FL thanks to his friends at the Akita Rescue Society of FL and Donte\u2019s Den.  Hiro weighs about 85 pounds and is in great shape considering what he has been through wandering the streets.  Hiro would probably do best as the king of his castle being the only pet. Hiro loves attention, going for rides, and just sitting close to his favorite people. Hiro loves exploring his neighborhood as he walks well on leash.  Hiro is up to date on all his shots and has a gastropexy to help with any dangerous bloating in the future.  Hiro would make a great companion as he is only looking for that forever family that he can call his own.",

If you are interested in adopting this pet...You must fill out the adoption application at:\nhttp://www.marlcares.org/adopt_app-dog.php\nPLEASE READ all the following info. We do not reply to inquiries asking if the dog is still available, if it is listed here, then it is still available.\n\nCricket was found with Possum on a rural country road.  After asking around we found out that she had been left behind and other people had been shooting at her and we found a BB in her back.  She was happy to see us and gave us kisses immediately when we found her.  She is a happy, sweet, affectionate dog that loves other dogs and everyone she meets.  We have no idea what breed mixture she is, most likely a cattle dog mix of some sort.  She is kennel trained.  She is in a foster home with small and large dogs.  She is approx 3 years old and approx 35 lbs as of Jan 2018.\n\n$150 adoption fee, spayed/neutered, microchipped, current vaccinations, and currently being kennel trained.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION: If you are interested in this pet you must fill out the Adoption Application\u2026which you can find on this site or you can copy and paste this link \u2026 http://www.marlcares.org/adopt_app-dog.php\nThis does not obligate you in any way. If this does not work for you then you can email us at midsouthpets@aol.com for one.\n\nPLEASE DO NOT CONTACT US BEFORE READING THE FOLLOWING INFO:  \nYour inquiry may not get a reply if you have not read the info we have taken the time to provide.  PLEASE READ about our ADOPTION PROCESS AND REQUIREMENTS provided on this site before contacting us.  You can find it quickly by clicking on our NAME or MORE ABOUT US in the column to the right of this pet\u2019s description.  All your questions can be answered by reading the following info provided below.  Our pets are fostered in the Memphis Area, a tri-state area, TN/AR/MS.  Most are fostered in Red Banks, MS.  \n\nWe do not allow meetings with any of our dogs until we have your Adoption Application.  Adopting a new family member should involve a well-thought out and deliberate process. This is not an impulse purchase. Please understand that we do not want these animals to be homeless again. We try to complete the process as quickly as possible and appreciate all the applications and will consider each and every one we receive. \n\nFilling out the Adoption Application does not obligate you in any way, but simply tells us a little bit about you and whether you and this pet would be a good fit for each other.  We will call you after we receive your application and answer all your questions and talk to you about this pet.  After being approved, we will set up a time to bring the pet to meet you and your family and pets or set up a time for you to meet the pet at the foster home.\n\nNO PHONE CALLS PLEASE.  Rescue is a full time job every day.  Please know because we are so very busy with the dogs along with processing applications, updating webpage\u2019s, rescuing, in many vet appointments, caring for seniors and hospice dogs, etc, etc that we are not able to return phone calls or emails asking if this dog is still adoptable, how much is it to adopt, is it house trained etc\u2026We have included all the info we have on this dog at this current time and update the bio as we learn more about them.  We kennel train all the dogs and will indicate if there are housebreaking issues that we have discovered.  We update our site regularly so if the dog is listed here they are in fact adoptable, but may have applications coming in on them, so if you are interested, you need to get your application in now.\n\n**WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE ANY ADOPTION**  Our first concern is the happiness and welfare of the animal.  We respect our potential adoptors and appreciate your interest in adopting one of our pets.  We care about you too and that you are getting the right fit for your home and lifestyle.  By following our process, together we can make sure you are getting the right pet.**\n\nNOTE: We prefer to adopt in the Mid-South AREA, usually no more than 1-2 hours away in driving distance. It is up to the foster home, how far they are willing to drive. We rarely adopt long distance, but will consider each and every application. \n \nMidSouth Animal Rescue League is an all breed, 501c3, non-profit organization that prefer to rescue senior dogs and special cases.  WE LOVE ROTTWEILERS...With 20 years of experience with our beloved ROTTWEILER breed, and little help for this breed in our area, we try to focus on rescuing them and try not to ever have to turn any away that need us\u2026especially the seniors that end up in shelters.  Currently, we have several senior rottweilers in our hospice foster program.  We always need more fosters so that we never have to say NO to them or other seniors.  \n\nWe have also started a community relief effort specifically in the Red Banks, MS area not far from us, called The Dog House Project, where we go door to door providing dog houses to dogs on chains and other dogs and cats without proper shelter, including straw in cold temps, as well as food and other supplies as needed.   We offer free spay/neuter services to those animals and continue to check on them all year.  To date many have been spayed and neutered and some have been surrendered from their neglected lives on chains.  We are making a difference and need your donations to continue this program.  We always need igloo type dog houses.  \n\nMidSouth Animal Rescue League relies on the kindness, generosity, and financial support of people like you so that we can continue to rescue and care for dogs like this one. We are a group of dedicated volunteers who respond to animals in need in shelters, strays, and from individuals. We receive no federal or state funds and are supported solely by private donations. \n\nMany of the animals we save are in need of special medical care or surgery to bring them back to health before they can be placed. Veterinary care, vaccinations, tests, x-rays, medications, spay and neutering, heartworm prevention, flea/tick prevention, worming, food, kennels, grooming, and other supplies are provided for each dog while in our care. \n\n",

She LOVES her balls & KONG toys!  She had an accident as a puppy and she has issues with her back left leg but you would never know it.  She is so toy driven that as long as you play ball, she will do anything else you want her to do!  This girl grew up in a car as her human was homeless.  She deserves a home and family that will love her as much as she is going to love you!  She was surrendered pregnant and all of her puppies found their families but she needs you to take her home with you!  She is up to date on all vaccines, spayed, micro-chipped and heartworm negative.  She is on monthly heartworm & flea/tick preventative.",

I live with my foster mom and a pocket size beagle currently along with a couple outdoor kitties. I do well with everyone, but I do need my own personal space and I like to eat alone. If my feline or canine friends are too close to me during meal time or continuously get too close to my face....I will tell them to back off a bit. But, the majority of the time I love their company! I love to take short runs and long walks but prefer to be indoors most of the time snuggled in my bed.\n\nIf you are looking for a low-key basset hound that can be a couch potato when you want to relax, but also play and go for walks then I'm your guy! If you are interested in meeting me or hearing more, please contact CBHR and fill out an application. My bags are packed and I'm ready for my very own forever home! And thank you thank you very much.\n\n9/5/18\n\nCarolina Basset Hound Rescue adopts in North and South Carolina.

I am good with other friendly dogs. I am good with kids for the most part once boys are older I get scared of them too. I am housebroken and crate trained. I am quite fearful of men and do best with patient understanding men who can give me time to acclimate and I mean time. I do live with a man currently and he is great. Unfortunately they cannot keep me since they have other dogs already to care for. I am great outside the home just inside is where I have some problems. I do love all women of course cause im a ladies man. I have come a long way and have done well meeting new men. My foster mom thinks Im such a good boy who just needs the perfect home. I am super loyal and I deserve happiness just like any other dog. My ideal place would be a home vs apartment as I am active and will bark initially when alone or if I hear questionable noises. Please email angela@forgetmenotrescue.com for more info.",

She looks into your eyes with with such patience and wisdom.\n\nShe is 9 years young and a smaller girl\u2026 around 60lbs. She is easy going and mellow but has a playful side, too.\n\nHer owner since puppyhood could no longer keep her due to life changes, and she misses him. But Gracie is recovering her happiness in her foster home with AFLAR. She is looking for that special someone to bond with again. He was a truck driver and she used to ride with him in the truck every day. She is happy on car rides, and waits politely for her person to return from errands.\n\nGracie is a very special dog. She is very tuned in to people, and naturally moves to give comfort and affection when needed. She would make a wonderful therapy dog. She is gentle and calm, and loves to snuggle with her head on your lap. Her energy is very soothing and healing to be around.\n\nGracie is crate trained and is very comfortable in her crate. She has had some obedience training. She is really smart, learns quickly, listens to commands, and wants to please. She has lovely house manners, and doesn\u2019t chew or get into things she\u2019s not supposed to.\n\nGracie is also playful. She likes her squeaky toys and balls, and loves her walks. She lived happily with a cat, and shared her water bowl. \n She gets along well with other dogs who are respectful of her and have a mellow, calm energy. She would prefer, however, to be your one and only, and give you all her love.\n\nGracie would love a home where her family is around a lot, because she doesn't like to be alone too much... and she has so much love to give!\n\nIf you are interested in a wonderful companion and someone who will love you unconditionally, GRACIE is your girl!!!\n\nCONTACT: (805) 445-3535\ninfo@allforloveanimalrescue.org",

We hadn't had much to eat in a longtime and I was so hungry that I finally laid down in the pavilion of Overton Park about to give up. I saw this person sit down with his dogs and that dog looked so happy, he was getting plenty of water, treats, and love from his owner. I picked up my head and the man saw me and called out to me, but I got scared. I was really nervous but then he took out something that smelled so good I could not resist it. I went over and gobbled it right up. He kept producing this yummy food all the way to his house where we went inside. We were out of the heat and he fed my shepherd friend and I both our first good meal in weeks. We are hanging out here until we find our forever homes!I am crate trained, potty trained, and have even learned how to sit and stay for treats. Cats and strange dogs make me a little too excited but I am so ready to meet my forever family! Could that be you?\n\nBehaviors not listed have yet to be tested.",

I spent most of my young life chained up in a yard until one day, I broke free and a nice man picked me up. My ears were covered in fly bites and I had some punctures on my face, so the man got me straight to the doctor where I met a nice lady who got me all better! I've spent time learning about leash walking, potty training, doing basic commands for treats. I was born around 7/1/2016. I\u2019m a boy and Doc says I've probably got some Staffordshire in me along with some other cute and cuddly dog breeds! I would do great in a home with kitties and probably pups too, but needs some proper introducing. I would love a running buddy or an outdoor explorer to take me on car rides and adventures. I've been spending some time in boarding looking for a foster or even a forever home and I'm determined to meet just the right person soon!! I can't wait!\n\nBehaviors not listed have yet to be tested.",

He and his litter mates would have frozen to death had someone not contacted the Clinton County Animal Control Officer. Sparky was adopted from us and returned now 2 years old, emaciated, and having severe pain in his joints and jaw. \n\nHe has had an extensive knee surgery, and is now recovered. Sparky has auto-mediated poly arthritis. He has good days and bad days where his joints hurt, and sometimes has trouble moving around. He will need special vet care, and medication for the remainder of his life. He has been seen at the University of Illinois by a specialist there.\n\nPotential adopters can visit our website at www.centraliahumanesocietyil.org to find our online application. Our application consists of a vet check - adopters must take their current/past pets to the vet yearly for vaccines, and dogs must be given heartworm prevention 12 months out of the year. \n\nAll adult dogs have been spayed/neutered, microchipped, wormed, heartworm tested, receive heartworm preventative, and are current on shots, including canine flu vaccine. Puppies are current on shots and wormed.  They will be spayed/neutered and microchipped once they become of age.\n\nSee our website for hours, fees and directions to come visit!",

I was unfortunately neglected in my early life, but since I got rescued I've had nothing but good care and love. \n\n I had a little setback when I hurt my knee a while back, but my surgery was 100% successful and I'm ready to go home with the right person.  My foster mom has taught me good manners, and I really want to please.  Some other dogs are okay, but I'd really love to have you all to myself.  \n\nBecause I am a strong, active girl, I need a securely fenced yard for my playtime.  Please let the people at the rescue know if you'd like to give me a home:  adopt@stfrancisrescuenac.com.",

Hound mix and even though daddy didn't leave a calling card (and no puppy support!), we think he could have been an Australian Shepherd or mix, best guess. \n\nNumi is the smallest of her litter, weighing about 42 lbs but that doesn't stop her from playing with the big kids! She's mostly black but is also brown with some white markings, too. She is very sweet and self assured even though although she will need a lot of patience while decompressing when placed in a new home - she would be best suited for a home with another resident dog sibling. She get the zoomies once in a while but is a fairly laid back dog as a rule. Because she is a hound, she would not be suitable for apartment dwelling.\n\nIf you would like to meet Numi please go to www.newbestfriend.org and submit an adoption application. Our adoption fee is $250 + sales tax and includes spay, vaccinations and microchip.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: We do not adopt outside the Greater Houston area.\n",

Hound mix and even though daddy didn't leave a calling card (and no puppy support!), we think he could have been an Australian Shepherd or mix, best guess. He definitely has the hound gait so that is the dominant gene.\n\nNiles is the largest of the litter at about 50+ lbs but could use a bit more weight, with 60-ish being ideal. He is a goofy gentle giant and is mostly black with brown markings. Niles is fairly laid back but does love to go outside and explore the entire yard and perimeter. He would do best in a home with another dog and because he is a hound, would likely not be suitable for apartment dwelling.\n\nIf you would like to meet Niles please go to www.newbestfriend.org and submit an adoption application. Our adoption fee is $250 + sales tax and includes spay, vaccinations and microchip.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: We do not adopt outside the Greater Houston area.",

Hound mix and even though daddy didn't leave a calling card (and no puppy support!), we think he could have been an Australian Shepherd or mix, best guess. Naomi is mostly black with brown and has very distinctive markings on her feet. Her coat stays very sleek even when she rolls in the dirt! She currently weighs between 35 and 40 lbs.\n\nShe is loyal and loves to be near her human but can also entertain herself. She would do best in a home with another canine sibling to play with. Because she is a hound, likely would not be suited for apartment dwelling.\n\nIf you would like to meet Naomi please go to www.newbestfriend.org and submit an adoption application. Our adoption fee is $250 + sales tax, which includes vaccinations, spay/neuter and microchip.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: We do not adopt outside the Greater Houston area.",

            "description": "Say hi to Molena. This sweet girl is house and crate trained. She likesolder kids and some polite MALE dogs. Cats are a NO. She is people social and loves meeting new people. This is a velcro cat-like dog! She rubs on you, wraps around your legs, climbs into your lab. She is spayed, HW negative, micro chipped, and current on her vaccinations. Mo doesn't like to do her business with an audience. She will potty on leash but really prefers a fenced yard. After an adjustment period, Mo can be trusted not to chew or potty in your home.\nIf you are interested in offering this sweet flower a place in your heart, fill out our on-line application at www.etnpitbullrescue.org.East TN Pit Bull Rescue adopts out to companion homes only. Adoptions require an application that is verified, a meeting that includes ALL members of the household, a home visit, and a trial period. We do not place our dogs in homes with unaltered pets or homes that have pets but do not have a vet. All of our dogs are placed as inside pets, spayed/neutered, micro chipped, vaccinations current, and HW- or treated within the last 6 months for heart worms by our vet. Adoption fees start at $150 for adults and $200 for pups.

Xena was severely underweight, covered in fleas and heart worm positive at that time. She has gained weight and is on heart worm treatment, and her health has greatly improved since arrival in her foster home in Concordia MO. If you want a companion with lots of personality, this is the girl for you! Xena is good in the house, does like to sit on the furniture at times and will check out the counter tops and she is crate trained. Xena gets along well with other dogs, but she has not been around cats. She could be okay but we just don't know. Xena also does well in the yard because she doesn't dig or try to climb or jump the fence. She enjoys the sun and the space. For more information contact Jon at js86bacon@gmail.com. Adoption $250. Please contact sandy@dalmatianrescueco.org. If interested in this dog, please go to www.dalmatianrescueco.org and submit an application for adoption. Under Adoptions, please read our adoption policy. We must have an application before we can begin the adoption process and each dog does have foster contact listed.\n\n1/22/21 9:08 AM",

Our adoption center is located next to CAL Ranch at 232 North Jones (I-95) Suite 170.   \n\nJack is about   4 1/2  yrs old.   He came into a high kill shelter where we rescued him from.  He was very emaciated (only weighed 52 lbs).   He is very smart and eager to learn.  He loves to play fetch as his favorite but also will keep himself busy with other toys.  \n\nHe is strong on the Doberman gene, so when he is on a walk, he will bark and lung at strangers if they are within a couple feet radius.  (he corrects easily and listens to \"no\" from his owner)    People walking further away than that, he ignores.  \n\nHe is a very beautiful Dobie who needs a strong owner to give him guidance and structure and they will be amazed on what he can be.  He would do best with someone who understands the breed or a similar breed.   He needs a home with out children or teens due to his protective nature.   \n\nHe will not be placed in a home where we do not feel is a safe situation for him or the home.  More will be known about me soon.   \n\nA Path 4 Paws holds adoption events at our Adoptions Store,  located at 232 N. Jones Blvd, Suite 170  right next to CAL Ranch (North Jones/ I-95).   Please bring your dog(s) for a meet and greet (if applicable)  Please bring your entire family so everyone can meet. \n\nIf you are interested in Jack, please contact dogrescuelv@hotmail.com to confirm the dog you are interested in,  will be attending that particular event.  We have limited space at the store, therefore we can not take every dog out to the event.\n\nJack is spayed/neutered, has current vaccinations and includes a microchip, deworming and 2 free vet visits.  Adoption fee applies.  Please make sure you have read the information listed on the homepage for requirements and restrictions. \n\nFoster homes & volunteers are always needed.  Please contact us regarding how you can help by fostering or volunteering for our organization.",

IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN FOSTERING AMOUR, PLEASE GO TO THE MAKE A DIFFERENCE RESCUE FACEBOOK PAGE AND SEND A PRIVATE MESSAGE THAT INCLUDES YOUR PHONE NUMBER AND EMAIL ADDRESS.\n\n\nMeet beautiful Amour. She is a 7 year old Terrier mix. Amour was forced to be on the streets, no home or shelter exposed to the frigid temperatures. This little girl was on her way to being a statistic, frost bite setting in on her toes and open wounds that were swollen on her rear leg. We are thankful for the good Samaritan who took Amour in and called us. She immediately had surgery to remove two sores and was spayed. \n\n Amour developed kidney failure a few months ago. Her recent lab work shows her kidney function has improved and she now only requires SQ fluids every 3-4 days. She is on special food for her kidney failure. She needs to have a quiet home without other dogs and children.  Amour is very good on a leash when going for walks. Her forever home is required to have a fenced yard where she can safely explore and play. Amour is spayed, up to date on her vaccinations, on monthly heartworm preventative as well as house and crate trained. As her name implies, she is full of love and she cannot wait to share her love with her forever family.\n \n\nAll dogs we rescue stay with us until they find their forever homes. We do not do same day adoptions. A home visit is required to ensure our dog is going to a safe environment and our dog gets along with your dog(s) and/or cat(s). We require all our dogs over the age of 1 year attend 1 obedience class (6 week session) outside the home. You must live within 1 hour of Birmingham, MI to adopt one of our dogs. No out of state or outside the U.S. adoptions or fosters.Amour's adoption fee is $275.",

He is an incredibly smart, loving dog who needs a comfy couch to lounge on. He is very loyal to the people he trusts, but wary of strangers. He needs a special home with owners who are willing to love him for the dog he is, while also being cautious of letting him around other animals. He is house trained and would make an excellent addition to the right family. \n\nHodor has been vaccinated, micro-chipped, and neutered. For more information call Project Hope at 618-638-4555",

She was dumped there by her owner while they kept the rest of the litter. Lily had a head tilt, we don\u2019t know if this was through abuse or accidental but we were informed that she was going to be euthanized. Over time, she went through physical therapy and her head tilt got a little better but never completely went away as you see it here and there. She is now 6 years old and weighing at about 45lbs. She has been in the rescue for all these years with no serious interest. She is  beautiful, healthy and would make a wonderful companion. She\u2019s good with people, kids, and other dogs but no cats please. \nIf anyone has any questions, feel free to ask or if you\u2019re interested in adopting Lily you can fill out our adoption application in the link below!\nhttps://form.jotform.us/81468545084161\n\n*Transportation is provided to approved adopters anywhere in the state of Florida!",

She loves playing in the water, too, and plays daily with the hose when we change her water -even when it\u2019s cold outside!  She is also toy crazy.  You could toss a ball all day for her! She'll get the ball and then drop it at your feet so you'll throw it again. Rubirosa is housetrained and crate trained. She just loves walks.\n\nRubirosa's best home would be with a young active female.\n\nRubirosa had a rough start to her life; we rescued her during an animal cruelty investigation, and we discovered she had an embedded collar. She had major surgery on her neck but she is healthy and doing well now.  However, she will require a fenced in yard so she can run around after having been chained up inhumanely. \n\nRubirosa's date of birth is 9/22/2016 and she weighs about 51 pounds. She will be happy in a home with other dogs and older children. She has been in a foster home with 2 other dogs and enjoys going on walks with them in the neighborhood. \n\n*We did receive a donated Wisdom Panel DNA test for Rubirosa and we found out she is: 87.5% American Staffordshire Terrier and 12.5% Breed Groups: Herding & Guard.\n\nYou can submit an adoption application for this \u2018fetching\u2019 young lady at http://www.fayettefcar.com/applicationform, where you can also review FCAR\u2019s adoption requirements.\n\nAll FCAR adoptable dogs have been spayed or neutered, are current on all vaccines, on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, microchipped, and come with a 30-day pet health guarantee. The adoption fee is $95 with an approved application. A fenced yard is required for Rubirosa.\n",

Apply to Foster Kali Today!Breed: Pit Bull Gender: Female Estimated Date of Birth: May 23, 2012 Size: 50lbs Location: Dallas, GA\nRESCUING KALI\nIn June 2012, 3 puppies were dumped at Animal Control. They were only a few days old and without a mom so their chances of survival were slim. The next day, Animal Control brought in a lactating female. Although she may or may not have been the real mom, she stepped up to the challenge. The mom and AC Staff did everything they could, but 2 pups died.\nThe wonderful people at Animal Control reached out to us and agreed to hold the mom and the surviving female puppy for a few weeks until we could pick them up. The mom was treated for heartworms. The puppy,Kali, was a healthy girl.\nABOUT KALI\nKali has a zest for life and she loves toys! She'll zoom around with any toy you give her. She is completely happy to run around with a ball in her mouth all afternoon. Kali is a bundle of fun-loving energy that would enjoy any activity as long as she is with her people. She would be a fantastic running or hiking partner. She would even just be happy to chase the ball around the yard for you. Seriously, this girl could play fetch for days. Playing fetch with a Chuck-It would be a dream for her. Kali has done well with other submissive male dogs that can handle her energy. Kali would do best in a home with older children, 13 and up. Her best friend, Teddy, and her mother have both been adopted and Kali is patiently waiting for her fun-loving family to arrive. This girl is full of vigor, smiles, and personality! She would prefer to be the only dog in the home, but with proper introductions and the right canine match she would likely be okay with a canine companion.\nPhoto Album of Kali: https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.531860010205503.1073741859.162554320469409&type=1&l=eff6e419eb\nOur adoption fee is $300. All dogs are current on vaccinations, spayed or neutered, micro-chipped, on heartworm prevention, and are fed top of the line grain-free food.www.savingpitbulls.org",

            "description": "Khloe is an approximately 3 year old purebred pitbull terrier. Khloe is the mom to the 7 puppies listed. Khloe is a love with people and enjoys being your shadow. She craves attention and love and thrives on it. Khloe does okay with other dogs but would prefer to be an only child. We do not know how she would be around cats but would not recommend a home with cats. Khloe originally lived in a kennel so she has never been housetrained. She is very smart and does well in a crate so crate training her  and getting her on a regular pottying routine would be the best way to get her completely housebroken. Khloe did end up in a kill shelter which is where we rescued her from. We did not know that she was pregnant at that time. We will be getting Khloe spayed and vetted before she leaves us and after she weans her beautiful litter. Please consider giving this adorable, loving girl who has had a rough start in life a permanent, loving home. She deserves a shot at a family of her own just like her babies do. If interested in giving Khloe a forever home, please TEXT only to (3520215-3260 or EMAIL your interest/application/questions. Khloe's adoption fee will be $150 and will help to cover her spay and cost of care while with us.",

Cooper will need to have an experienced dog owner and someone who is going to be willing to give him a job and keep him on his toes at all times. We are not willing to put Cooper in a home with kids that are under the age of 16. He enjoys going on walks and running in his fenced in area playing with his people. CHS is committed to finding the right matches for not only our pets but also our adopters. We have a unique approach to our adoption matching process. Our kennels are not open for the public to walk through, as this helps us keep our dogs as happy and comfortable as possible. Due to our commitment to being such strong allies for our pets, we ask that you please either call 503-397-4353 or email animalwelfare@columbiahumane.org before just showing up to meet our pets. We would like to take the time to get to know our adopters so that we can make only the best matches between you and your future new family member.For more information call 503-397-4353 or email animalwelfare@columbiahumbia.org 2/2/21 6:13 AM",

Consider one of our Well Seasoned Seniors who are truly wonderful and have so much to offer. Need help finding the best fit? We'll help with that too. Please fill out an application and let's get you all matched up with a loving new \"furever' companion and friend. You'll find the application on the \"Available Dogs\" page.\n\nNOTE:\n\nAdoptions to Central/South Texas residents only\n\nStandard Adoption Fee Adult Dog: $250 ea. Puppy Adoption Fee: $300 ea. Reduced rates for Seniors dogs (10 and up). Reduced rates for pairs (when adopted together). All adoption fees are subject to sales tax per the State of Texas. DDRTX only adopts in Central/South Texas.\n\nEmail: ddrtxinfo@gmail.com Primary Website: www.DDRTX.org\nMr. Louie Luckenbach is a big boy at almost 35 pounds. Louie has suffered a lifetime of abuse and neglect and while he is very sweet and loving, he can be unpredictable and would need an experienced home. He is very sensitive about his amputated toe even though it has healed; it caused him a great deal of pain for possibly a very long time. He has some permanent hair loss due to food allergies. He is food aggressive but his foster mom is working with him on it. He is perfectly house trained.\nLove dachshunds and not ready to adopt or circumstances won't permit having a dog? How about being a sponsor or making a donation. Every one of our dachshunds receives excellent medical care along with day to day food, love and housing. Being non-profit, we rely on generous individuals like yourselves to help save these fur babies. You can do this specifically for one dog with the sponsor button on their webpage or a general donation on our \"How To Help\" page. Easy and quick through Pay Pal or your debit/credit card. You generosity is sincerely appreciated by all and is tax deductable. Need other ideas? You'll find tons of them on the How to Help tab. All contributions are tax deductable.\n\nDiamond Dachshund Rescue of Texas is a non-profit 501(c)(3) volunteer organization with focus on rescue and adoption of pure breed Dachshunds. All dogs are fully vetted and housed on private property. Meetings are scheduled upon adoption approval. Thank you for your continued support to the rescue and shelter communities!\nOpt to Adopt!",

He likes to follow his nose and will need a secure fence to keep him and his hunting instincts safe. When he is in the mood, he likes to play fetch for a little while, but he is generally a medium energy dog and happy to take long naps. Shiloh could stand to lose the extra pounds that he put on in his last home, but, as most Beagles, he LOVES his food and hates the idea of a diet or sharing his food.",

Zora has basic obedience and she is crate trained and housebroken. She is dominant with other dogs, so she would probably be best as an only dog. Zora is not good with cats. She is confident and outgoing with people. Zora was born in 2014 and she has a medium-high energy level. Unfortunately, during the time Zora has been in our rescue program it has become evident that she is in the early stages of Wobbler's Syndrome, so she is available as a special needs gal.",

This big boy-90 pounds-is approximately 6 years young. He *adores* riding in the car! He\u2019s a great rider\u2026sitting politely in the passenger seat next to you-giving VERY SOFT looks at you while still keeping his eyes on the road! He's a snuggler when it\u2019s time to call it a night. He loves treats and squeaky big toys! Dunkin Donuts is Max's favorite spot to enjoy a plain donut stick or munchkin on occasion. Max enjoys swimming in the Farmington River as well as paddling around in his kiddy pool. Maxie Boy needs a firm handler\u2026although he is a goofball, he will try to test you at times and see if you are a pushover :) Max doesn't like to share his humans much with other animals so a home with no others would be best along with an adult setting (responsible teenagers would be fine). A fenced in yard would be absolutely wonderful for this big guy but not a requirement.\n\nSADLY, this handsome guy is living at a kennel-but he would so very much love a caring home of his own.\n\nPlease contact Lauri at Booch0517@aol.com / 860-622-9775 OR Sue at Thorjoey60@yahoo.com / 860 309-1077  to find out more or to FILL OUT AN APPLICATION FOR BEAUTIFUL MAX.  \n(DO NOT FILL OUT THE APPLICATION ON THE RESCUE WEBSITE).\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 MORE VIDEOS \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 \n(may need to copy & paste links into a new internet tab)\n\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/195740713?ref=fb-share\n\nhttps://youtu.be/knpzucVI2nk\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Ia7DhMcVhjs\n\nhttps://youtu.be/EXXClxWAggI\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/130028224\n\nhttps://youtu.be/eZq6tAwNDlQ",

Reggie is a super friendly guy and he likes to have a good time, but he also enjoys lounging around.  This handsome fellow does guard his food, so he needs an owner who understands his boundaries.  Due to this, he must go to a home with no kids under the age of 12.  He also needs to be your only furry companion - he kindly requests a household with no other dogs or cats.  Reggie is a sweet boy and he deserves a wonderful and loving home.  He's been patiently waiting for that perfect match.\n\nHis minimum adoption fee is $95 plus a $12 fee for rabies registration for McLean County residents. \n\nHe has been neutered, microchipped, vaccinated, heartworm checked, dewormed, and is on flea and heartworm preventatives.\n\nFor information about this dog's breed(s), visit: http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/abc.htm \n\nTo fill out our adoption application, go to: http://fs16.formsite.com/WishBoneCanineRescue/adoptionapplication/index.html",

I am about 5 years old, and am told that I am super sweet, and well behaved.  I love taking walks with my foster mom and dad and their dog (yes I am great with other dogs).  I am leash trained,  house trained,  and don't get up on furniture unless invited.  I am about 75 lbs, but very gentle. I just like to hang out with my human, getting belly rubs when I can.  Will you be my new forever family?\n\nEmail info@habitat4paws.org for an application.\n\n**Because we require home visits, we only adopt locally to the Dallas/Fort Worth area.

He loves to show you how intelligent he is.  He knows sit, wait and okay(release).  Stu loves to play with balls, ropes and he loves peanut butter!\n\nStu is a cuddler and loves to sleep in bed with you if allowed but is just as happy in a big fluffy dog bed.   He likes to walk and does well with a leash and harness.  He is a very chill dog and you will fall in love with him instantly.\n\nHe is house broken and crate trained.  He takes medication for separation anxiety.  He is not a big barker, but will let you know when there is someone around the house is he not accustomed to be it two or four legged.\n\n\nTo learn more contact us at adoption@ihadro.org or apply today at www.ihadro.org!

His owner is having surgery and won't be able to take care of him. Beau Duke's a 4-5 year old Anatolian Shepherd mix. Very docile, calm and gentle this guy is well behaved, walks great, knows sit, stay, down and shake. He's as golden a boy now as he was when we first met him! Beau Duke has a fantastic demeanor. His adopters describe him as friendly, affectionate and playful. They further noted that his greatest quality is that he's very loving and his worst was the shedding! Beau Duke shared his home with one other dog and 3 cats, all of whom he got along with well. His adoption fee is $150. He's neutered, vaccinated, wormed, microchipped and treated with monthly heart worm, flea and tick preventive. Beau Duke's a fantastic dog!",

They like to call Von, licky licky because she is very affectionate.  She likes to cuddle under the covers.  She loves to run with her foster family, and she loves chewing on her bones.  She can be food aggressive with some dogs. She has never had a problem with the foster family's current dog.  We would not recommend a home with small dogs or cats because of it.  She is an aggressive chewer so she probably should be kenneled when not home.   Her foster family has not seen her around children so we are unsure of what her reaction might be. Von is 3 years old and weighs approximately 30lbs. She is current on vaccinations and has been spayed and\n   </p>\n\n<p> Courtesy Post.    </p>\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Von pleasee complete an online application   You can find our application here:  <p><a> =\"http://sadinc.org/Adoption_Application.html\"> \n  </a></p>\n\n<p>Adoption Fee- $75.00 *  We do not ship dogs * We do not accept checks</p>\n\n<p/>Although we are an all volunteer organization  we make every attempt to respond to emails and applications on the same day they are received.\n</body>\n</html>",

His tattoos are unclear,  We have determined that he was born in February 2009, but that's all we know about him.\n\nStoney was found by a Good Samaritan on Gladstone Street in League City.  He was emaciated, covered in fleas and had intestinal parasites.  He was anemic and was in generally terrible condition.  The League City Animal Control release him to us so we could nurse him back to health.\n\nWe are happy to report that Stoney has gained alot of weight, he is free of the blood-sucking parasites, and his bloodwork has improved.  He is out of the woods medically speaking, so now we are looking for a special family that will open their hearts and their home and keep him safe for the rest of his life.\n\nHis personality is very sweet and he loves people and snuggling.  He is sweet with small dogs at PetSmart and we believe he will be good with cats, although we have not yet cat tested him.  Stoney knows how to do stairs. He currently weighs 60lbs.\n\nStoney did not do well as an only dog in an apartment all day long by himself. He thrives in a home with a dog door. We are currently adjusting his meds and with any luck he should be available again soon.\n\n01/12/2019. PUPDATE!!!  Due to his ongoing medical issues it has been decided that Stoney will be kept by FastK9\u2019s in Permanent Foster status. Any donations toward his ongoing medical treatment would be greatly appreciated. \n\nStoney is no longer Available for Adoption.",

We do plan on keeping them together, because they have been together all of their lives and are inseparable. Bodhi seems to be good with other dogs, but Gracie is not a fan of other dogs being around Bodhi. Neither one of them are good with cats. They would probably do best with being the only Fur- Babies in the home. Gracie and Bodhi both do very well on a leash, and love to go on adventures together. These to adorable Fur- Babies are just looking for their forever home, and would love to meet you!",

            "description": "Snowflake is a loveable and affectionate girl who is a total house dog, just wanting to be inside with her family as a companion and protecter. She is a happy girl with a tail that curls prettily over her back and wags happily when she sees her person, a leash or food bowl. She loves morning and evening walks. She gets along with other dogs and can be bouncy and playful with them but would be content as either an only dog or with another dog her own size. She is house trained, crate trained and respectful of property. She is very mellow overall but can get crotchety with young dogs who are disrespectful. She knows her basic commands and walks well on leash with a training collar. Snowflake loves playing in the yard, car rides and running errands with her person. She is a perfect companion dog who is non-intrusive when you are busy. She has not been around children so would do best in an adult home without cats.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting any of our dogs please complete an adoption or foster application on our website at\nwww.happyheartsgsr.org\n. Also please follow us and get the latest updates on our dogs on facebook at\nwww.facebook.com/HappyHeartsGSDRescue\n.\n\n2/2/21 12:37 AM",

            "description": "Hello!! My name is Victor!!! My former owner tied me to a pole and abandoned me!!! You can't imagine how scared and alone I felt!!  I was lucky enough to be rescued by these nice people before something bad happened to me!!  \n Even with all that I have been through... I am a very sweet boy that loves attention.  I love to play tug of war, but sometimes I think the leash is a rope toy to tug on, so they are working with me on that.  I take treats very nicely and listen pretty good. \nI do have a very high prey drive and need to work on my listening skills when I see those little critters running or flying around in the yard or when on walks.  I REALLY just want to chase them!! But with consistent training and treats... I'm sure I will learn!! \nI  need someone that is willing to work with me and give me some strict obedience training.  I am a good boy... I just need someone to give me a chance!!  Could you be that someone???\nOh... I almost forgot...  I do not do well with other dogs, so I need to be the only dog in the home and I'm not sure if I have ever been around those little furry things you all call cats!! \nI would love to find my forever home soon.... I have been here far too long.\n I can even be fostered or fostered to adopt!!!\nIf you can open your heart and home to me... please fill out an adoption application at: \n                                        www.dawghous.com\nThank You! \nLove Victor\n",

He is also playful and gets along with all other dogs and would be happiest in a home where he has a yard and another small dog to play within the home. He does not like to go on walks.

We are happy to discuss the challenges he presents in detail with interested parties. Disney is on the smaller side at about 80 pounds.  We will be looking for an experienced adult home committed to house training, obedience training and working obedience into his everyday life. Disney does fine in a crate for a reasonable length of time, loves car rides and can be quite the affectionate boy. He is good for the groomer and vet, walks well on leash, loves toys and plays well with most other dogs.  \n\nAdoption info and application can be found at gprci.com  Securely fenced yard for safe outside potty and play time will be required.",

He was adopted by his foster family when he was a year old but due to medical issues, they are forced to return him to the rescue.\n\nKuma is good with other dogs, and loves kids.  He is a protective dog, so will need dog savvy owners willing to work with him and not allow him to interact with strangers.  He needs slow meet and greets and will never be a dog park dog or one that hangs out at a backyard bbq!\n\nKuma is totally housebroken, great in his crate, and knows basic commands.  While he is a fetch addict and will require daily exercise, he loves curling up on the couch for movie night and sleeping in in bed on the weekends!\n\nTo apply to adopt, please use our fillable app here:  https://forms.gle/eqEChRtYMPshWYuX8\n",

And she has a sweet & silly personality to match.\n\nMOLLY likes people & is the perfect size,(approximately 40-pounds).  She came to Animal Alliance in January 2018 with her three adorable puppies who have all found their forever homes!  It wasn't until just recently that MOLLY was lucky enough to find her own foster home, prior to that she was at our shelter.  MOLLY is learning house skills and manners and is eager to please! She loves to play fetch and is happiest when she can cuddle up on the couch with her humans!\n\n\n***\n\nWHAT'S NEXT?\n\nIf you would like to meet, foster or adopt this pet, please fill out our online FOSTER/ADOPTION APPLICATION which can be found in the main menu of our website or at the bottom of this page - simply copy and paste the link into your browser. EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs.\n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

I am a very loyal fur kid and once I trust you, I will love you and protect you forever! I do not like cats and I am a little picky about other dogs. If you let me meet your other dog first, I will like them after I get to know them a bit. Also, I am best around older, considerate children. \n\n My adoption fee is $150 and it includes spay/neuter, rabies vaccine, DHPP, and microchip.

But I am also very beautiful as every single person who sees me tells me that, almost like that is my second name. Bella Beautiful or Bella Bellisima! I have been in boarding for a long time, I would love to have my own comfy bed and a family to call my own. I would need a strong person, and someone who is just as stubborn or more so, than me, as I need my training to continue, if you don't remind me, then I will forget, and then I will get in trouble, as I will revert back to my puppy ways of jumping on people, and they say that is not cool. I think it is fun, but whatever, that is what they say. I am also friendly with people, I do like some other dogs, but I prefer to have all your attention to myself. I will probably learn to like another fur sibling, but you would have to introduce me slowly, as when I was younger another dog attacked me when I was just walking by him. Can you believe that! I love to go for walks and car rides. Adoption fee: $150.00 and includes spay/neuter, rabies vaccine, DHPP, and microchip.

I was on the list to be euthanized at a high kill shelter, but was saved. Right now I live in a boarding facility and I wish every day for a forever home or at least a foster home. I am sweet and very handsome, as you can see. I love long walks and back yard play. I love to be by your side at all times. I play a little hard to get, but once I warm up, I am all yours. I just need my own special someone to work with me every day. I need strong leadership and someone who will follow through with my training, because if you don't remind me I will forget, then I will go back to my puppy ways of jumping! And people say that is not cool. I dream for a quiet environment with no children where I can be the only pet- I would do best in a home with no other dogs or cats. \n\nMy adoption fee is only $150 and it includes spay/neuter, rabies vaccine, DHPP, and microchip. You can fill out an application at www.pawprinthearts.com and then meet me to see for yourself how awesome I am.",

Below the map is our logo and the link to click on to access adoption forms, contact info or to donate. ALL DONATIONS ARE TAX DEDUCTIBLE.\n\n\nAdoption Fee:  $150.00\n\nBuster is a very sweet, fun and loving fella.  We really don't know how old he is.  The shelter he came from said \"age unknown\" and followed that up with a guess of 15 years.  Well he is still running and playing with the other dogs two years later, so we just don't believe that!  He weighs around 12 pounds.  \nBuster has a peach of a personality and is so precious! He has lots of energy and is always ready to entertain. \nHe is not fully house trained.  He will go outside if taken out frequently but will have accidents inside.  He also is a barker, so if that would be a concern for neighbors, then he would not be the right fit.\n \nBuster has Cushings disease and a collapsing trachea.  It's a toss up which of those conditions is responsible for his almost constant coughing and he is on six medications daily.  One of those is cough syrup which helps him only temporarily.  Help with his medical costs would be greatly appreciated.  \n \nHe's doing great in spite of his challenges....always happy and always a great big goofy grin!  \n \nBuster is being fostered in Largo, FL enjoying the sun and fun until his forever family picks him up!\n\n\nNOTE: SCMR DOES NOT adopt to homes with children under the age of 10 years or homes with Electric Fences\n\nOut-of-state adoptions are possible; however, the approved adoptive home is responsible for making the necessary arrangements to pick up their new little one.",

He lived in a home for a long time with other dogs but when his owner passed away no other family member could take him and he was brought back to the shelter. Roger is blind,  but functions in the kennels just fine although he does enjoy going for walks he will need a calm household with some patience to show him the way. He is housebroken and just wants to lie on a comfy bed and gnaw on a bone. If interested in adopting Roger please fill out information form at lifelongfriends.org/adoptions. You must live in Texas to adopt from us and all family members must meet Roger before being approved.",

He has a strong prey drive and needs an experienced handler. \n\n\nKing is a special boy who needs some special attention. He's a very active, hyper guy, and as such, would not be a good fit for a family with kids. He receives regular training in the shelter with wonderful results, but he definitely needs someone to show him that humans can be trusted and lead him into being the great guy he is in his soul. He's mischievous, rambunctious, willful, loving and smart.\n\nKing would do best in a home with moderate to high energy, no dogs or cats, and no children. We think he would be a prime candidate for agility training, a bike rider, or runner. A fenced-in yard is required for King.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this animal please go here to find out how and fill out our app online: http://www.caaws.org/adoption-application/\n\nAdoption Information:  Our dog and cat adoptions are held every Saturday from 11:00am to 3:00pm at our building, located at 6357 Quinn Dr in Baton Rouge, LA, near the Old Jefferson and Tiger Bend intersection. Please see http://caaws.org/special_events.htm to see specific details on which locations we will be at on specific dates. The adoption fee for our animals is $125 and covers all vetting, shots, vaccinations, tests, and neuter/spays.  For further questions please email us at caawsmail@yahoo.com or ask the adoption counselors at adoptions!.",

We can make alternate arrangements for meeting the FURS dogs but would require an approved application for adoption.  There is no fee or obligation with submitting an adoption application and applications can be completed on line at www.fursdogs.com\n\nA required step of our adoption process is to conduct a home visit.

            "description": "Matilda has an adorable underbite that gives her face such character.  She likes to romp in the yard and also play with a ball.  Matilda can be cautious meeting new people at first, but once she trusts you she is loving, sweet, will give kisses, be silly and happy go lucky.   She is looking for a low foot traffic & quieter home and someone  who is willing to give her some time to get to know them. Matilda is not a fan of cats and at times is picky about her doggie friends. She had tested positive for heartworm but has long since completed heartworm treatment and is doing fine.  Matilda is 5 years old and 68 pounds. Please help Matilda find the loving home she deserves.\n\nMatilda would do best in a home with the following criteria:\n-No kids, other dogs/cats/pets\n-Adult only household preferred \n-Experienced dog owner\n-Low foot traffic home (non active home without lots of people coming in and out)\n \nPlease understand that we are an animal shelter and thus unable to say whether the dogs are housebroken as they are not in homes.\n\nPLEASE USE THIS LINK TO SUBMIT AN ADOPTION APPLICATION. WE ONLY ACCEPT ADOPTION APPLICATIONS THROUGH OUR WEBSITE. ANY OTHERS WILL NOT BE PROCESSED.

We are just about to consider them a bonded pair, so if you are truly interested in Willow, AND a qualified home, not someone who would throw WIllow out in an unattended unfenced yard, you have only a short time before she will be able to be adopted alone!  \n\nWillow is a BEAUTIFUL, EXTREMELY DOG-FRIENDLY, affectionate, playful, devoted dog!!  She deserves a terrific home that will prize her as the precious being that she is!  She is active and energetic, but also a sweet cuddler when she gets to spend that one-on-one time with you.  She's around 45 - 50 pounds, strong, healthy, and has beautiful eyes that will pierce right through you.  She loves her kennelmate Colton  DEEPLY, and they are getting more and more bonded by the day.   Don't pass her by - she has a vibrant soul and a bleeding heart that is overflowing with love, and needs the opportunity to SHINE!!!\n\n",

YoYo has been spayed, is up to date on all shots, microchipped and HW negative.  \n\nShe came into our rescue from a high kill shelter in S. Louisiana where she and her 2 day old babies were hours away from being euthanized.  Thankfully we were able to take her and pups into our program before this happened.  \n\nYoyo is still looking for her forever home. \n\nShe has been in her foster for over a year now. \n\nShe is a 3 year old, lab/shepherd mix.\n\nShe is house trained and kennel trained. \n\nShe is great with kids! \n\nShe is spayed, microchipped, and up to date on shots! \n\nShe HAS to be the only animal. She is very protective over her people! \n\nShe MUST have a fully secured, fenced yard. She LOVES to play! \n\nHer adoption fee has been paid by an anonymous donor that just wants her to have a great home! \n\nIf interested in this beautiful girl, please fill out an application at danteshope.com!",

            "description": "Max B. is a gorgeous boy who appears to be a mix of black lab and maybe golden retriever. His estimated birthday is April 2013 and he weighs around 75 handsome pounds.\n\nMax made his way to STAF when his owners realized that they were getting old and no longer able to give him the exercise that he needs. Sadly they never explored positive based training for Max. Max had lived with another dog (as well as a cat) in this home and they got along very well, but we believe Max will be happiest being the only dog in a home.\n\nWith the lack of exercise and training, Max began pulling more on leash and depending on the dog he was passing, was also becoming more reactive when seeing some dogs while out on a walk. We are quite certain that Max would have benefited greatly from positive based basic obedience while in this home. Max walks very well on leash and is a favorite to walk with many of the STAF volunteers. Max is super smart and already knows many basic commands. He is definitely a pleaser and is eager to learn.\n\nMax is very affectionate and he melts whenever his favorite volunteers make his way.  Sadly Max does have some fears and he does like to take his time getting to know new friends and will do best in a family without younger children as well as a family that would be open to working with STAF\u2019s training team to give Max the best possible fresh start in a new home\n \nMax makes regular home visits with a STAF volunteer who let us know that \u201cMax B. is beautiful in my home. House broken, doesn\u2019t touch a thing and is happy to quietly sit by my side all day as I work. He is perfect!\"\n\nMax is not a match for the couch potato home, don\u2019t get us wrong he loves to lounge; especially after a long walk or a long fetch match in the yard:).  An active home committed to exercise and positive training will reap the unwavering love and devotion of one very special canine friend.\n\nMax will benefit from: A fenced yard and an active home\nMax would love: Positive based training\n\nPlease see our homepage for visiting hours and adoption details. \n\n* All of our animals are spayed/neutered and current on shots.\n* We do not do same-day adoptions; we ask that you return for a follow-up visit before taking an animal home.\n* You must be 21 years or older to adopt a dog from STAF\n* We require a physical fence for homes with children under the age of 11.  We also may require a physical fence for specific dogs on a case-by-case basis, depending on each dog's behavior and exercise needs.\n* Invisible fences - Due in part to increasing coyote activity/incidents in the area and the difficulty of predicting how a dog will respond to invisible fence training, we cannot adopt to homes with invisible fences.\n* We do request vet and personal references.\n* At this time, we are only able to consider applicants within 75 miles of Cincinnati.\n\nCan\u2019t adopt but want to help? You can make a difference! Our shelter is run entirely on volunteer-power and generous donations from animal-lovers like you. 100% of your contribution goes directly to caring for our 500+ furry residents.  Thank you for your support.\n",

The people had just left him behind. She took Tyson in and he's lived with her family now. WE know that Tyson does have a few medical issues. Things he can live with but adoptes should be aware of. He has bone spurs on his lower spine. Sometimes, after being crated, he moves stiff and it is noticable.  He also may have some vision issues on one side of his head. Very hard to tell as he compensates for it well.  Tyson is used to living with other dogs and cats, but would really be happiest in a home as a single dog.  He enjoys walks and human interaction.\nFor more information on Tyson, please email rescuebc@hotmail.com  Include your location and a phone number for future communication.",

            "description": "Jackson - in Maine - updated November 2020\n\nJackson is a beautiful 3 year old boy and he has had a long rescue journey. He is a handsome big boy who needs a very patient and understanding family who is ready to work with the shyest of boys. Jackson would not do well in an environment with small children or a lot of people coming and going. He definitely does best in the presence of another dog and a consistent routine.  He is very sweet once he gets to know you. He loves to play with toys and run around outside. He doesn't mind cats and he is friendly with every dog he has met.   He is staying with our rehabilitation friends at Kompletely K9 and he helps with some of the other dogs who need a good playmate. \n \nWay back in 2017 the J pups and their mom were found by a mailman out in a rural part of Arkansas. They were in rough shape, living in the summer heat without shelter or shade. Our partner rescuers worked very hard to catch them, nurse them to health and get them ready to journey north. Because the pups were older when rescued, they missed out on critical socialization and it has taken a long time for every one of them to feel safe with people. Because people can be wonderful, all his siblings have found forever homes but Jackson has been a more difficult placement and is working with our friends at Kompletely K9 Training and Rehabilitation.  We just love this big guy and would love to see him find forever love. This is not a dog for first-time owners or for a growing busy family, but for someone with experience with scared dogs. We will work with you on training and slow transition to your home if you have interest in Jackson. \n \nIf you have interest in meeting Jackson or any of our cuties, please fill out the adoption application here: http://www.luckypuprescue.org/adoption-application.\n\nPlease note: we do not have a physical facility where our dogs are housed; they are cared for in our wonderful foster network throughout New England. It is our expectation that, once approved, a potential family will meet the dog(s) in the foster setting where they are feeling safe and loved.\n\nThank you for considering rescue!",

He has energy but does calm down and likes to cuddle on the couch.\n\nDakota can be dog selective. He does not get along with other male dogs and would do best in a home either as an only dog or with a calm laid back female. Likes to chew toys, has seen cats and is curious, likes kids but should be in a home only with children 7 years and older because of his size, energy level, and playfulness. \n\nIf you are interested in Dakota it would be best to meet him in a low key location or at his current foster home.  It is also recommended that potential adopters meet Dakota more than once and that slow introductions be done with any other dogs who will be in his pack.  \n\nDakota will make a great dog but he does need a family that will commit to maintaining his training and socialization.",

Is she a Chesapeake Bay retriever mix?  A terrier mix? Is she a cat trapped in a dog\u2019s body? We only know Nika is a beautiful, independent girl who takes her time to get to know new people, but once you are in her circle you can see how special she is.\n\nNika has been with us for a while because she is a true unique spirit, and we know she is just waiting for that perfect home and that we just have to be a bit more proactive in finding it. She is smart and cautious, although roast beef goes a long way in helping her make new friends. Nika can be nervous meeting new people, which has made it a challenge to find her a home, as she does not connect with people until she trusts them, so she needs someone who will take that time and appreciate that her affection is not easily won. \n\nNika likes to do her own thing, sniff the yard, play with a toy, but when she is in the mood she loves a good ear scratch or butt scratch.\n\n\nIf Nika could pick her perfect home we suspect she would pick a quiet one, one set far back from the hustle and the bustle, near woods for quiet walks, and maybe with a pond so she can swim (she loves to swim).\n\nAn adult or two to love her, and take her for walks, and with a nice fenced-in yard for her to explore and sniff and enjoy. \n\nNika was returned to us because the children in the home brought energy and activity that made her nervous, so we would like to see her in an ADULT ONLY HOME. She can also get overwhelmed with a lot of activity outside the home so a busy neighborhood with lots of kids and dogs around can be too much for her; she thrives in a rural setting.\n\nNika does fine being crated for a work day and seems to enjoy the time to nap, chew her chews, and reflect on life.  She is also house trained, and has good house manners. Once she is used to her person, she comes when called off-leash.\n\n In the past Nika has lived with a male dog and cats, but we are not sure if she wants to continue sharing her home. As she has matured she may prefer to be the queen of all she surveys, but she may do well with the right dog. We are not sure. We are sure, though, that with love and consistency, Nika is able to relax and be such a wonderful dog, who will make someone very, very happy.\n\n*****\nDue to Massachusetts State Regulations we are unable to adopt to residents of Massachusetts at this time. We apologize for any inconvenience.\n*****\n If you are interested in adopting this dog, please complete an adoption application at https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/PEP/Dog. Or visit our site (http://peppertree.org/adoptlist.php) and learn about other Peppertree dogs. *Note: visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.",

He was surrendered to our rescue because he was nipping on the toddler in the home, over food but nonetheless not a situation they were comfortable with working on.\nWe took on Loki and are currently working on his social skills and behaviors. So far he is doing great and he is a happy guy who loves all people. Loki doesn't love to be alone and would thrive in a home where he is with someone more than not, and/or is in a good routine mentally/physically where he isn't bored or left alone for long hours.  He is on medication to help with his anxiety.  He has a ton of love to give and is such a cuddly loving dude!\nLoki is looking for a forever home with no small children or cats/small animals and preferably one with dog experience. He would love to stay social with animals and active in his forever home. He has a lot of love to give and is a great boy looking for a home to love him!\n\nAdoption Process: Anyone interested in meeting our adoptables must complete an online application, which is located on our website. Once the application is approved we will set up a meet and greet with the animal to ensure a good fit and then before adoption is complete we will schedule a home check to ensure a safe environment for the animal you are looking to adopt. We do not do on-the-spot adoptions and we do not adopt out animals by a first-come, first-serve basis. We strive to fit everyone of our animals to the best match possible!\n\nwww.redemptionrescuemi.com",

So, I'm always down for a walk or hike but after I'd love a couch nap with my family. Perk? I'm great in the car and super affectionate with my humans. Also, I can even share attention with other dogs if they're deserving lol. PS did I mention I'm about 7 so I love my naps (aka low maintenance)! Who needs a travel buddy??? Jada is up to date on age appropriate vaccinations, spayed, microchipped, and on heartworm prevention. Her adoption fee is $175.\nAll of our dogs are spayed or neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccinations, microchipped and if over 6 months of age, heartworm tested and on heartworm preventative in their foster home.\n\nWe require an approved application to meet any of our dogs. We do not have a shelter location and will not arrange a meeting without an approved application.\n\nWe strive to make sure the bios provided for our dogs are complete and accurate; we do understand that mistakes happen, however, so if you absolutely cannot find the answer to your question in the dog's bio, you can contact us for more information.\n\nWe require a home visit for each dog we adopt out, so we adopt within a 2 hour radius of Dayton, OH. If you are outside of this radius, we encourage you to contact your local rescue or shelter.",

I have been in the rescue a loooooong time because until very recently I was scared of everything. The nice ladies in the rescue took me in when I was 4 months old and I won't tell them what happened to me before that, but it was bad and I was so scared. A few months ago I had the opportunity to go see this wonderful trainer named Alicia and she helped me and my foster momma learn how to deal with my fear and anxiety and now I'm doing so much better! My momma challenges me every day and I'm finally learning how to act like a dog (and not a scaredy cat)! I love to play and run in the yard now with my foster siblings and sprawl out on the couch and chew a bone. I still like my crate, but I like to be outside of it now too! I am still a little timid when meeting new people, but I will bark while checking them out instead of running to hide, and you can win me over with cheese! If you can show Evie love and patience, please apply! She deserves a forever home to call her own!\nEvie's adoption fee is $175. She is up to date on age appropriate vaccinations, spayed, microchipped, and on heart worm prevention.\nAll of our dogs are spayed or neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccinations, microchipped and if over 6 months of age, heartworm tested and on heartworm preventative in their foster home.\n\nWe require an approved application to meet any of our dogs.

That is where my true beauty lies (don't get me wrong, I'm a very cute pocket pitty too). I absolutely adore children!!! In fact, I love all people! I like to follow my people around and give them all of my love. I'd be an excellent companion for someone working from home or just someone who wants to be greeted with a giant smile and wiggle butt when they come home. I'm an adult so I already know all of my house manners and commands (I've even had some formal training!). I occupy myself well playing with my toys but I'm over all that puppy energy and mischief. I just want to be your best friend and have a home of my very own! Alika is up to date on age appropriate vaccinations, spayed, microchipped, and on heartworm prevention. Alika's adoption fee is $175.\nAll of our dogs are spayed or neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccinations, microchipped and if over 6 months of age, heartworm tested and on heartworm preventative in their foster home.\n\nWe require an approved application to meet any of our dogs.

I had a rough start in life living on the street with people being mean to me and then taken to the very scary shelter. But I am so happy I was rescued and brought to a loving foster home with 5 small dogs to play with and help me build my confidence. I am extremely scared and skittish with my humans at first, but over time have got so much better...But I still cannot be picked up. I will never be called a cuddlebug but I am a very loving and loyal girl that needs to be accepted for who I am now. I would do best in home with no children.\nMy home must have a yard and a dog or two to play with that make me feel safe and some very patient humans that realize I am shy and cannot be picked up\n. It will take me some time to get comfortable and settle in, but I promise I am worth the wait!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please go to our website and complete the adoption application: http://www.icaredogrescue.org/ready-to-adopt/\n\nAdoption fee includes: spay/neuter shots up to date micro-chip fecal and vet check",

Ziggy is eager to please and as happy to be playing fetch as he is with just sitting next to you with his chew toy. We know he will make any home feel complete, not just with his sheer size but with his sheer love too. \n\nZiggy has every reason to dislike people instead of loving them. He was adopted as a puppy and dumped in a Utah shelter. We immediately flew him home and were shocked at his transformation. This handsome dude had received zero socialization and manners. Ziggys intelligence is evidenced by his recent graduation from a 6 week board and train program with Golden Heart Canine. Here Ziggy learned basic commands and how to better interact with other dogs. \n\nZiggy is almost a perfect gentleman on the leash. He knows heel, sit, stay, and wait. He is still working on his doggie interactions and proper introductions, but you can tell he wants to do the right thing! His forever home will need to continue his training, recognize his areas of improvement, and love the goofball that he is. Ziggy relies on his human to perform proper introductions and be the alpha, therefore, he would do best with an experienced owner or breed experience. To help with this the rescue will provide support from the trainers along with videos showing the techniques that need to be continually practiced For now, Ziggy would do best as an only dog in the home and preferably should not be in a home with small children. Ziggy is crate trained, potty trained, and is a great kisser! \n\nWe know Ziggy's REAL forever home is out there, waiting to spoil this love bug with kisses, treats, and continued training! So why wait for Valentine's Day to meet this hunk when he's available to sweep you off your feet now!\n\n*BSL Restrictions may apply.\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\t3 Puppy combo shots (Distemper/Parvo)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicro-chip\n\tRabies\n\tDe-worming",

If you are interested in meeting Logan, please contact us at adoptions@pawscrossedny.org for more information!*\n\nBefore you can adopt sweet Logan, please complete an adoption application on our website at pawscrossedny.org! Once your application is approved, you will receive a link to schedule an appointment online. If you have any questions about Logan, please email us at adoptions@pawscrossedny.org for more information. Please understand we cannot hold any pet. All adoptions are done on a first come, first adopt basis for approved applicants.\n\nThe Shelter software system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of our dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix.

            "description": "\"BE SURE TO WATCH MY VIDEO!\" \n\nLINCOLN IS IN A FOSTER HOME\n\nDate of birth: 11/2016\n\n1/27/2021: Lincoln is a playful and fun-loving Hound/Malamute mix! He\u2019s 4 years old and weighs 70 lbs. Lincoln is very friendly and he's a total ham! He absolutely loves to play with tennis balls and toys. He loves to fetch and he can also entertain himself with his toys. \n\n\u2022 Lincoln is looking for a home with someone who has dog experience and a fenced yard to play fetch in.  He loves playing outdoors, but he needs a privacy fence\u2014 he will jump a short fence. \n\n\u2022 He needs daily exercise to wear him out. He really enjoys going for walks and he walks nicely on a leash. He loves to take in all the smells! \n\n\u2022 Lincoln is a bit too rambunctious to live in a home with young kids, and he needs a home without other dogs or cats. Fortunately, he's got enough personality to fill a home all on his own! He's a character and makes us laugh a lot! \n\n\u2022 He is house trained and crate trained.  He\u2019s not a big fan of the crate, but his foster parents say that he isn\u2019t destructive when left uncrated.\n\n\u2022 He is very food motivated and he loves treats! \n\n\u2022 His foster parents describe him as equally snuggly and independent. He\u2019s a big lap dog, but also happy to curl up by himself. \n\n\u2022 He can walk in pack walks near other dogs and is not reactive. \n\n\u2022 He knows several commands\u2014 sit, down, leave it, and down\u2026 although sometimes he conveniently forgets!  \n\n\u2022 He\u2019s not a big barker. He\u2019ll bark when the mail comes or when someone knocks, but not excessively at all.\n\n\u2022 Lincoln has been neutered, vaccinated, microchipped and tested for heartworms. He was a stray. He\u2019ll be a great companion for someone looking for a goofy, fun-loving guy! \n\nMORE ON ADOPTING OUR DOGS... \n\n> COVID-19 UPDATE: PLEASE SUBMIT AN ONLINE ADOPTION APPLICATION AND A MEMBER OF OUR ADOPTIONS TEAM WILL REACH OUT TO YOU. Please visit our web site at HSGKC.ORG for an adoption application, our current COVID-19 adoption protocol, and other adoption info.  \n\n> If you decide you'd like to adopt one of the pets you meet, we reserve the pet for you but we generally don't send the pet home with you that day. We\u2019ll instead schedule a pick up date and time that\u2019s convenient for you.\u00a0  \n\n> Our goal is to send you home with a healthy pet and any information and support you may need to help your new pet adjust to his or her new home.  All of our dogs & puppies have been spayed or neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, treated for fleas & ticks, tested for heartworms (7 mo. and over), and are on monthly heartworm preventative. Puppies who are too young to receive all the necessary puppy boosters and/or first rabies shot may be brought back to us for those vaccines at no extra charge. You will also receive a leash, collar, coupons for pet supplies and services, toys, and educational materials. And we'll give your dog a bath before he or she goes home! \n\n> Please note that we prefer and may require a fenced yard for many of our dogs.  Exceptions are made on an individual basis depending on the dog's needs, the person's dog experience, the dog's and person's activity levels, home environment and other factors. \n\nThank you for searching for a shelter pet!\n\nDog Adoption Contact Info:\nEmail: christine@hsgkc.org\nPhone: 913.596.1000 ext. 113\nhttp://hsgkc.org",

She\nrea\nlly is great with kids and people of all ages.

Tywin would do best in a home with another dog (his best buddy in his foster home is Betty - also available for adoption). He is sensitive and cats scare him so he would be the happiest in a home with at least one other dog, but no cats. Tywin truly is a special and unique pup! \n\nLike all Mikey's Chance dogs, this dog will come to you from a foster home that has provided loving one-on-one attention, socialization and some basic training, as well as quality food and exercise. \n\nApplications can be found at www.mikeyschance.com and completed on a computer, tablet, and/or phone. Please note that adopters are not chosen on a first come, first served basis, but full consideration is given to the best fit for the dog AND the adopter. Applications can take up to 3 weeks to process \u2013 application submission does not guarantee approval for adoption..",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Personality:\n\nNone of our foster dogs are tested with cats because we have no way of testing them with cats. Siberians are notorious for their high prey drive and typically kill cats, rabbits, chickens, birds, squirrels, opossums, etc., so we we don't have much success adopting them out to homes with cats. Most of our foster dogs are with us for killing cats, chickens and goats to begin with so our assumption is they are not good with cats and other small things that move.\n\nSiberians are typically good with children of all ages and the only reason we would not list them as not good with kids is because they may be too energetic and bouncy and knock over a toddler.\n\nSouthern Siberian Rescue is a volunteer based 501(c)3 organization based out of Raleigh, NC, so we do not have a physical facility with operating hours that you can visit to meet our dogs. All of our foster dogs are in our personal homes. You need to fill out our adoption application (http://www.southernsiberian.com/info/adoption) and get approved to adopt and then we will set a time for you to meet our foster dogs. As a volunteer based group, we all have jobs, family, personal dogs and other commitments but we try to acknowledge and process applications as quickly as we can. That being said, we try to keep our available foster dogs as current as we can also but it is time consuming to get pics and information on new dogs so not all of our dogs are listed at all times. Please fill out our application and then we can discuss dogs that will work for you and your situation. We average 40-45 Siberians in our program so we are certain we have one that will work for you. Please know that we are not obligated to answer inquiries on dogs as we will focus on approved applicants. Again, there is ample time to discuss all of our foster dogs AFTER we have an approved application on file. We do adopt out of state as long as we can get a home check done. We ask that you, your family and existing pets make the trip to NC to meet and adopt our foster dogs.\n\nSSR can not and will not hold dogs for anyone. If we do, that means another Siberian will die in a shelter because a shelter dogs time is very limited, as is our foster space. We do our best to process applications in the order received and first application gets first interest in our foster dog(s). We understand that there will be scheduling conflicts with home checks and meet and greets but we will try to accommodate for that if a potential adopter has interest in a particular foster dog in our program.\n\nAll Southern Siberian Rescue foster dogs are microchipped, up to date on shots, spay/neutered, on monthly heartworm preventative and flea and tick preventative. For additional information on Southern Siberian Rescue and Siberian Huskies, please visit www.SouthernSiberian.com. To fill out an application, please visit\n\nhttp://www.southernsiberian.com/info/adoption\n.",

            "description": "Ziggy is a giant ball of fun whose love for people is only exceeded by his love for giving kisses. A very tall Boxer mix, he is as handsome as he is confident and smart. Ziggy is eager to please and as happy to be playing fetch as he is with just sitting next to you with his chew toy. We know he will make any home feel complete, not just with his sheer size but with his sheer love too. \n\nZiggy has every reason to dislike people instead of loving them. He was adopted as a puppy and dumped in a Utah shelter. We immediately flew him home and were shocked at his transformation. This handsome dude had received zero socialization and manners. Ziggys intelligence is evidenced by his recent graduation from a 6 week board and train program with Golden Heart Canine. Here Ziggy learned basic commands and how to better interact with other dogs. \n\nZiggy is almost a perfect gentleman on the leash. He knows heel, sit, stay, and wait. He is still working on his doggie interactions and proper introductions, but you can tell he wants to do the right thing! His forever home will need to continue his training, recognize his areas of improvement, and love the goofball that he is. Ziggy relies on his human to perform proper introductions and be the alpha, therefore, he would do best with an experienced owner or breed experience. To help with this the rescue will provide support from the trainers along with videos showing the techniques that need to be continually practiced For now, Ziggy would do best as an only dog in the home and preferably should not be in a home with small children. Ziggy is crate trained, potty trained, and is a great kisser! \n\nWe know Ziggy's REAL forever home is out there, waiting to spoil this love bug with kisses, treats, and continued training! So why wait for Valentine's Day to meet this hunk when he's available to sweep you off your feet now!\n\n*BSL Restrictions may apply.\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\t3 Puppy combo shots (Distemper/Parvo)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicro-chip\n\tRabies\n\tDe-worming",

August had flea allergies which have left him with bald spots at the top of his tail and back. He also has an old injury to his front leg which causes a slight limp. This injury does not cause him any pain and the vet suggested to just leave it as is since it is not causing any problems. August would do best in a home with no other pets. \n\nAuggie does not like some dogs so he does not do well going out for walks. He will growl like he is going to attack but it is all growl and no bite. He is quite the couch potato but makes a wonderful companion for someone looking for a pal.\n\nThe ideal home for Auggie is a home with a fenced yard and a comfy bed. \n\nIf you think you can give this boy a loving home to live out his years, please fill out our online application at www.dogsinneedorg.com. \n\nThe adoption fee for August is $150",

She is spayed, up to date on all vaccines, \n\n\n  She almost looks like a whippet-beagle mix.  \n Maggie was originally adopted at the adopthaton from the Nassau HS. When she did not work out at the adopter's home they tried to take her to ACPS but because she was adopted from the Nassau HS they would not take her in. Nassau would not take her as the adopter lived in Duval county instead of Nassau.  Maggie would not do good as a hunting dog. She needs to be a pet and  loved in a home. \n She is very food motivated and would be good in a puppy class as she is smart and eager to please. She is a typical Beagle. \n To adopt Maggie you must have a fenced yard, a vet reference, no small children as Maggie might play too rough and you must be a resident of the Jacksonville area.\nPlease Do not apply unless you meet our requirements. \n \n\n",

Blaze was adopted from us back in 2014 when he was just 4 months old. He lived happily with his family and even welcomed their new baby into the home the following year. Unfortunately, the child was diagnosed with autism and the energy level and sound made Blaze very uncomfortable in his home. He started hiding on a regular basis, so for safety concerns for all involved he came back to rescue.\n\nBlaze was an only dog in the home and after his adoption did not socialize with other dogs, it is still unclear if he is willing to accept other dogs. Though dogs he has become familiar with he will wag his tail and play bow at the kennel and through the fence. Once there is direct contact, he loses his confidence and shuts down and sometimes acts defensive. So we are still working on his confidence building around other dogs. He has not been cat tested. \n\nDue to his experience is his past home we feel it is best for Blaze to not be placed in a home with young children.\n\nBlaze can be shy of new people, but once he warms up he is an absolute love. He loves hanging out with his humans and doing whatever they are doing. \n\nBlaze is crate trained and has good house manners.\n\nWe are also looking for a foster home that would be able to further work with Blaze while he awaits his forever home. The foster home would have to have the ability to keep him separate from the other animals in the home and follow instructions given b y the rescue for training and socialization. \n\nFoster or adopter must be local to the Saint Charles County, MO metro area.\n\nBlaze's adoption fee is $200.00 and he is fully vetted. Interested adopters or foster must submit an application through our website to be considered.",

            "description": "Jarod was abandoned at a local Alabama veterinary office and as they opened the clinic one morning, they found this young puppy tied to their front door. A local Humane Association took this adorable baby and jokingly named him Jarod after the vet, Jarod Grantland.  As little Jarod grew, they soon realized what an enormous energy level he had. He jumps so high that he literally back flips back down to the floor. Jarod is extremely smart and is always trying to figure ways of getting out of being a good dog and running around driving us crazy.  He does this on purpose.....he is a smart dog.  One day I decided to challenge him and in a matter of 30 minutes, he learned \u201csit\u201d, \u201cshake\u201d, \u201chigh 5\u201d and \u201cdouble high 5\u201d.  He is the best dog in their humane shelter on feeding manners. He will sit and stare at his bowl forever until the command to eat is given. He will even shake your hand before eating to show his gratitude.  On that note, he is the worst dog in our shelter as far as being a curious brat! Turn your back for one second and he has opened every door or gate and proudly running amuck to show you what he did...lol. Jarod needs an experienced owner to control his mischievous ways. We also DNA tested him just for fun. Jarod is so slim and long legged that we were really betting on Greyhound.  He is 50% Staffordshire, 25% Boxer and 25% Hound/Terrier Group. Jarod is now 4 years old and has been with them since around 4 months old.  If ever there was a sad situation for a brilliant dog who deserves a real home, it is Jarod.  This heartbreaking situation just cannot continue in his life.  It breaks our heart and no telling how he really feels year after year not having the comforts of a real home. He lives in a kennel with a nice bed and good food....but not a home.  We will really  scrutinize where this boy goes.... we truly will.  We don't want a failure or return. He needs someone that loves a challenge and energy and intelligence that could outsmart you on a day you let your guard down.  But then again.... we don't really know what Jarod would do if he was the center of some family's world.  Would the antics stop?  And then would he just say....let's learn and be a great team and family?    Maybe Jarod needs to be a service dog that tracks things down or finds lost people?   Truly this boy is an Einstein trapped in a beautiful dog's body.  Does anyone have the key to unlock this boy from his kennel and let him REALLY live a good life where he can max out his potential?????  If you are so inclined to toss your hat into this adoption ring for Jarod...please email us at peaceloveandanimals@gmail.com. We are praying that we can change the stalemate in Jarod's life very soon.",

He is the type of dog that can see into your soul, so if you have bad intentions you are best to steer clear.\n\nBishop is a happy pup who enjoys doing what his humans are doing. Want to go for a run or hike? Bishop is down. Want to curl up and cuddle with a good movie? Bishop is down. Want to go on a road trip? Bishop is down.\n\nBishop does well with medium and up even tempered well balanced dogs. Small dogs and cats are a no go for him. Bishop needs a yard with a 6 foot privacy fence to keep him safe.\n\nThough he is smaller in stature than a full blooded Corso, his personality is all Corso. Bishop will be protective of his home and people and needs a structured home with prior guardian breed experience.\n\nBishop has good house manners and is crate trained. Though he has been around a small child in his foster home, due to his protective nature he would do best in a home with older or no kids.\n\nBishop is a local Saint Charles County, MO metro area only adoption.\n\nBishops adoption fee is 350.00 and he is fully vetted. Interested adopters need to submit an adoption application through our website, steppingstonebully.org to be considered.",

The rescue was kind enough to take me in but I am now ready for a new fantastic life.   I am very playful and have a lot of energy.  I would love to have an active family that would love me as much as I would love them.  I am patiently waiting for a lifetime of big adventures. \n\nPlease know that I will require a lot of exercise and that I\u2019m very strong; also, make sure that you know I don\u2019t like dog parks, I can go everywhere on a leash but I don\u2019t like all dogs, I am special that way and only like a few I meet but don\u2019t worry, when it comes to people, I like them all.  \nI have spent two months with a trainer and she says I\u2019m ready to go to a home anytime. \n\nMy adoption fee includes up to date vaccines, neuter, microchip, fecal test, health certificate and transportation. \n\n",

            "description": "Koda was born on 4/16/14. He is Pit Bull mix. He is neutered, microchipped, and has been vaccinated/dewormed/treated for fleas. He is potty trained, crate trained, enjoys car rides and going for walks. He's approx 84lbs - brindle with some white on him.\n\nThis dog has been FAILED by his former family and the \"trainer(s)\" they worked with. When he became too much work - he was scheduled to lose his life. When we reached out to take him/save his life... we had to plead with them to spare this young healthy dogs life. This is not a dog who does not deserve to live. This is not a dog who deserves to die because he's been failed by the very humans who were supposed to love him.\n\nThis IS a dog who will require a home who has the time, patients, energy, dedication, and love that will take to form a bond with him. He needs an owner who is not the least bit intimidated by his size or power. He IS stubborn- he needs an owner who won't give in or give up on him!! This isn't a therapy dog, service dog, or emotional support dog.. this is a rescue dog who needs a very committed loving owner who is willing to offer him the loving home he deserves. \n\nI would like him to be an only pet. While he has lived with other animals and is living with other animals in my home.. due to some small incidents we have had with him and other animals due to jealousy and some resource guarding - we feel he'd be happiest as an \"only\". He has never lived with children nor has he had much experience with children. He is easily excited and plays ROUGH.. for this reason, he'd do best in an adult only home.\n\nTo elaborate on how he plays... his former owners played very rough with him, so he has a hard time containing himself when he thinks its play time... I do NOT recommend rough housing with a dog of his size and power. He needs an owner who can set boundaries so he knows what is acceptable. When he tries to play outside with you - he'll race around and jump all over barking loudly... if you didn't know him, you could think he was being aggressive- but he just wants you to run around and play rough with him... which we do NOT do with him... so he's really catching on that when we're outside playing TOGETHER, it's a nice game of fetch!\n\nWe would like his new family to be open to working with a reputable trainer who understands dog behavior. We have a trainer we will recommend who has seen this dog, worked with this dog, and played an important role in saving this dogs life.\n\nWhile this dog can be a handful... he is not a horrible dog. He is not out of control, and he is VERY deserving of a loving home. I can easily handle him.. and I've been working hard not to put him in situations that would be stressful and I make sure I am always in control of the situation.. this dog needs a strong confident leader, but also someone who will teach him it's okay to love. He still gets excited when he hears cars pull up.. he doesn't understand why his former family gave up on him. He's much more loyal than they ever dreamed of being.. and he's one of the saddest dogs I've met... can you help me remind this guy that not all humans suck?\n\nHis dishes, blanket, toys, etc will go with him to his new home. We also have a crate and an outdoor kennel/run that we are happy to send with him to  his new home if needed/wanted.\n\nIf he is too active - running, jumping, hiking, etc- he will favor one of his back legs. Ensuring he doesn't over do it with being too active seems to help.\n\nIf there is anything else you would like to know please don't hesitate to reach out! If you're interested in becoming this guys new best friend... let's talk!! PLEASE be serious about adoption if you contact me about him. PLEASE be willing to work with a trainer if you're interested in adopting this dog. He will need dedication to get him to understand that not everyone will turn their back on him.\n\nMarysville, WA\n425-350-1198\nSaraNW113@gmail.com",

            "description": "Meet Buck! Buck is estimated to be about 1 1/2 yrs old with some rough times behind him- obvious from his embedded collar injury and the possible burn scar on his rear leg. Our best guess at breed is a Lab/Hound mix. Buck is 60 lbs of happy energy and he gets along well with other dogs and is potty trained and crate trained. Buck loves to meet new people! His enthusiasm leads him to jump up to greet people so we are working on manners. He would be perfect for an active person and would be a great running partner! He is a very smart dog so he needs to keep his mind stimulated. He has already learned sit and down and we are working on roll over. He is easily motivated so additional training or training classes would be perfect for him! He needs a secure fence and supervision while outside. Because he is a big puppy he would do best in a home with no small kids and other medium to large dogs. While he is good with other dogs he does bark when on a leash at unfamiliar dogs which can sound a little intimidating, but he is just so excited and wants to play. He has a goofy personality. His favorite snack is bananas and he likes to play in the bathtub!\n\nBuck is available for adoption with Saving Grace Dog Rescue of San Antonio. The adoption fee is $150.00. An adoption application, home visit and adoption contract are all required. All dogs are spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccinations appropriate for their age, microchipped, and wormed for internal and external parasites. If you would like more information or an adoption application, please email us at sgdrsa@outlook.com.\n\nPlease note that visual breed identification in rescue dogs is unreliable so for most of our dogs we are only GUESSING at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n1/25/21 10:05 PM",

This love of a dog was in a shelter in Nashville, TN but no one goes there to adopt much at all. This boy was definitely worth the save. He actually acts like a 2-3 year old dog as he loves to run circles in the yard when he gets excited. He is doing well with his leash waling and will even carry it to the door for you when he knows he is going outside! What a smart boy! Grant will do best as the only dog in the house as he becomes very attached to his owner. He loves to hike the trails with his foster dad and loves the outdoors. Grant is great home alone for a few hours and also is good in a crate if you are gone for the day at work. He is a snuggler and would love someone to lay on the couch with. He loves his people! He is pretty good with other dogs but he does take a little time to warm up if they are not laid back like his foster brother Cooper is. Carey Grant takes it slow and easy in determining if a new dog is going to be his buddy. He will chase cats so let's not move him in to a house with any.\n\nADOPTION FEE REQUIRED.

Our dogs are also given monthly heart worm medication in our care.\nDisclaimer: Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable, so for most of our dogs, we are only guessing at breed mix.

She cannot be crated due to anxiety over being confined in small spaces; However, she does excellent in the house and is comfortable in a gated room. She walks well on a leash, and is learning basic commands. She loves to play fetch, go hiking, and chill on the couch while chewing on her nylabones. \n\nShe can be wary of some strangers at first, but give her time and she will be your best friend! She seems to do fine with other dogs. We recommend that if you have other dogs, that they be of similar size. No small dogs or cats.\n\nWe try to limit our travel time for home visits to a two-hour driving range (about 75 miles) from Morganton, NC.\n\nPlease visit http://www.abetterlifeanimalrescue.com/adopt-a-pet.html for an adoption application.\nAdoption fee $100.00",

            "description": "**NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE** ... We are so busy with rescuing and caring for animals and can't return everyone's inquiry. If you are interested in adopting this pet...You must fill out the adoption application at:\nhttp://www.marlcares.org/adopt_app-dog.php\nPLEASE READ all the following info. We do not reply to inquiries asking if the dog is still available, if it is listed here, then it is still available.\n\nWe are looking for a foster home or forever home for K.I.\n\nK.I. was surrendered to us December 2017 after a year of watching him live on a short chain that he was constantly tangled up on.  We met K.I. through our Dog House Project...we were going door to door in a rural area offering dog houses and spay/neuter services to dogs in need and on chains in a rural area and he was in the road dragging a big chain...we stopped and got right in the van with us and immediately started giving us kisses...He had us at hello...The owner wouldn't let us have him, but we visited him often and took supplies and checked on him and continued to offer to take him if they would surrender him to us.  Persistence and patience paid off...it took a year...but they finally surrendered him to us.  He is the sweetest most affectionate dog you will ever meet.  He loves to go for rides.  He was great with all their grandchildren and when they would come visit you would see them walking him.  We were told that he had started out as a house dog when their son first got him...probably as a puppy, but when the son had to move back home, he could not be inside and because he would not stay put...they put him on the chain.  We think he had been on this chain for at least 2 to 3 years.  He is kennel trained and we think his approx age is 4 years old and he weighs 69 lbs as of Dec 2017.  He is a very strong boy and needs an owner that can handle his strength.  All he wants to do is cuddle and get attention.  You can see his heart break when he can't get to someone to be petted.  He is enthusiastic and can be energetic, but settles down very quickly and is calm and laid back and just wants to sit with you as long as you will pet him.  We just got him and will post more details as we get to know them.  We haven't had him long enough to know much about how he is with other dogs.  We do know that he had been loose alot with strays in his area and was ok when we saw him out with them, but since he was living a solitary life on a chain we want to really check this out.  Currently he has met 2 female dogs his size and did fine.  He is heartworm positive and we have started him on the slow kill method of doxy and advantage multi, but will treat him with the fast kill method in few months after he has settled into foster and been on doxy long enough.  We have pics of his life before and how he lived...he doesn't even look like the same dog now ... he smiles and is happy all the time now that he is off that chain.  Everyone at our vet loved him and everyone that meets him is just crazy about him.  You will never meet a dog that has more affection to give than this one.  He is looking for an owner that will be his very best friend forever...a companion to spend his life with.  Please consider K.I. ... he needs you.\n\nAdoption fee is $150 and includes ... spayed/neutered, microchipped, current vaccinations,  and kennel trained.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION: If you are interested in this pet you must fill out the Adoption Application\u2026which you can find on this site or you can copy and paste this link \u2026 http://www.marlcares.org/adopt_app-dog.php\nThis does not obligate you in any way. If this does not work for you then you can email us at midsouthpets@aol.com for one.\n\nPLEASE READ about our ADOPTION PROCESS AND REQUIREMENTS provided on this site before contacting us.  You can find it quickly by clicking on our NAME or MORE ABOUT US in the column to the right of this pet\u2019s description.  All your questions can be answered by reading the following info provided below.  Our pets are fostered in the Memphis Area, a tri-state area, TN/AR/MS.  Most are fostered in Red Banks, MS.  \n\nWe do not allow meetings with any of our dogs until we have your Adoption Application.  Adopting a new family member should involve a well-thought out and deliberate process. This is not an impulse purchase. Please understand that we do not want these animals to be homeless again. We try to complete the process as quickly as possible and appreciate all the applications and will consider each and every one we receive. \n\nFilling out the Adoption Application does not obligate you in any way, but simply tells us a little bit about you and whether you and this pet would be a good fit for each other.  We will call you after we receive your application and answer all your questions and talk to you about this pet.  After being approved, we will set up a time to bring the pet to meet you and your family and pets or set up a time for you to meet the pet at the foster home.\n\nNO PHONE CALLS PLEASE.  Rescue is a full time job every day.  Please know because we are so very busy with the dogs along with processing applications, updating webpage\u2019s, rescuing, in many vet appointments, caring for seniors and hospice dogs, etc, etc that we are not able to return phone calls or emails asking if this dog is still adoptable, how much is it to adopt, is it house trained etc\u2026We have included all the info we have on this dog at this current time and update the bio as we learn more about them.  We kennel train all the dogs and will indicate if there are housebreaking issues that we have discovered.  We update our site regularly so if the dog is listed here they are in fact adoptable, but may have applications coming in on them, so if you are interested, you need to get your application in now.\n\n**WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE ANY ADOPTION**  Our first concern is the happiness and welfare of the animal.  We respect our potential adoptors and appreciate your interest in adopting one of our pets.  We care about you too and that you are getting the right fit for your home and lifestyle.  By following our process, together we can make sure you are getting the right pet.**\n\nNOTE: We prefer to adopt in the Mid-South AREA, usually no more than 1-2 hours away in driving distance. It is up to the foster home, how far they are willing to drive. We rarely adopt long distance, but will consider each and every application. \n \nMidSouth Animal Rescue League is an all breed, 501c3, non-profit organization that prefer to rescue senior dogs and special cases.  WE LOVE ROTTWEILERS...With 20 years of experience with our beloved ROTTWEILER breed, and little help for this breed in our area, we try to focus on rescuing them and try not to ever have to turn any away that need us\u2026especially the seniors that end up in shelters.  Currently, we have several senior rottweilers in our hospice foster program.  We always need more fosters so that we never have to say NO to them or other seniors.  \n\nWe have also started a community relief effort specifically in the Red Banks, MS area not far from us, called The Dog House Project, where we go door to door providing dog houses to dogs on chains and other dogs and cats without proper shelter, including straw in cold temps, as well as food and other supplies as needed.   We offer free spay/neuter services to those animals and continue to check on them all year.  To date many have been spayed and neutered and some have been surrendered from their neglected lives on chains.  We are making a difference and need your donations to continue this program.  We always need igloo type dog houses.  \n\nMidSouth Animal Rescue League relies on the kindness, generosity, and financial support of people like you so that we can continue to rescue and care for dogs like this one. We are a group of dedicated volunteers who respond to animals in need in shelters, strays, and from individuals. We receive no federal or state funds and are supported solely by private donations. \n\nMany of the animals we save are in need of special medical care or surgery to bring them back to health before they can be placed. Veterinary care, vaccinations, tests, x-rays, medications, spay and neutering, heartworm prevention, flea/tick prevention, worming, food, kennels, grooming, and other supplies are provided for each dog while in our care.\n",

            "description": "Meet Moo! Moo is a 6 year old old Bull Terrier. Moo is an alpha female with an independent streak, so she needs a very confident and experienced owner. She would do best with a strict schedule, loads of exercise and a lot of training to keep her engaged. Moo needs a home without other animals, and not recommended for a home with children. She would take well to consistent training. Moo would also need a home with a fence. Moo is a love bug, just needs that 'person' that can give her what she needs!\nIf you are familiar with Bull Terriers and love this sweet girl as much as we do, fill out an application at www.barktownrescue.org.\nMOO'S ADOPTION FEE IS $160The shelter software system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of our dogs we are only guessing at the dog's predominant breed or breed mix. We strongly encourage you to select your new pet by looking at each dog's individual personality and pet qualities rather than relying on a breed label that is only our best guess.\n\nOur adoption fees vary from $150 and up. All of our dogs are up to date on vaccines, heart worm preventives, and flea/tick medication, and will be spayed/neutered prior to adoption. Portions of your adoption fee also help care for the sick and injured animals that we take in. Thank you for supporting us and considering a rescue dog!",

            "description": "Nina's history.\n\nAs of 8/19/2020, I am sad to report that Nina is no longer available. \n\nAn aggressive form of Melanoma has been diagnosed - 2 biopsies were taken to confirm - and, although the cataracts were the least of her problems (which I had planned to resolve), I cannot do anything to stop the cancer. I have been taking her in weekly for checks and the vet said that when she stops eating and cannot drink - it is time. :(  I'm afraid that time has arrived as of this week. I have tried to feed her by hand but the tumor is growing rapidly and interfering with her ability to eat. I am sorry to report this. I will be removing her from Petfinder by tomorrow (Thursday 8-20-2020.) Thank you all for asking about her. I could not be caring for a sweeter companion.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNina came to me scared and skinny. She had not had a bath, been groomed, or vaccinated since the day she was adopted in April 2008. The couple lived with his son-in-law and his wife and I am told the dog was never taken for a walk, never saw a vet other than the first time she was adopted, never had a dental and never lived with anyone who showed her any kindness. When I took her in she weighed 10 lb; the son-in-law was planning to have her euthanized until I told him I would take her in. Then he had her shaved down to her bony skin. I was told she is poodle and I think there is poodle in her but her conformation shows Bischon Frise.\n\nShe has gone from the scraggy, scared ol' lady to a princess with the energy of a puppy. She greets me standing on her back legs, front legs pawing the air as you see many poodles do. She's a good ol' girl but wants to be the boss of my 75 lb Boxer cross! Yes, she does get away with it. \n\nNina has cataracts in both eyes. However, it doesn't slow her down at all. I was told by the Eyecare for Animals that white dogs such as Nina are prone to cataracts. I have an appt to get her cataracts assessed. I did have them assessed - 3500.00 for one eye and 6500.00 for both eyes.  We did have someone from WA state who met her. As it is with many people, sometimes when you see a pet you consider, suddenly it brings back memories of a past loved one. I know that feeling too. Since her teeth needed attention, I got a much needed dental for her - $1800.00  As soon as I can afford to get her eyes done, I will do that too.  Nina gets along great with my other dogs and the cats. One of my other dogs, a Poodle, was diagnosed when he was a year old. At that time I had surgery on both eyes for him. He is now 11. Having eye issues has not slowed Nina down one bit. She runs like a racehorse. She now weighs about 15 or 16 lb. Like I said, she has the energy of a puppy. Older dogs (and cats) are at a disadvantage since the majority of the people  do not want a dog older than a couple of years. Dogs like Nina are marvelous companions. If a senior person wants an pet full of energy, she would be perfect because I know the joy and comfort she can bring into a person's life. Taking her for walks would not be marathon adventure. You don't have to try to keep up with her. She'll keep up with you. If you truly want a loving companion, please consider her.  Since I am unable to upload pictures from my phone to this computer, I would gladly send it to you from my phone. Several people have inquired about her. I believe that in one of the interviews she was just too energetic for the person's lifestyle. She has had a couple of interviews since then. May 31 is the first opportunity that Nina will have to get groomed since this whole COVID situation started and everything was closed down. She is all the characteristics you see. It's so easy to fall in lover with her - at least it is for me.\n\nIf you would like to see her or have questions, please feel free to contact me at my gmail address:  KRSDINC@GMAIL.COM. \n\nThank you for reading this.\n\n",

The shelter just didn't have the resources to treat us, so they sent us to TIRR Rescue in the hopes they could help us get better and find great homes.\n\nI am now completely cured of distemper, as is Gwen.  I could really use a nice, loving home that will give me the love and attention I need.  I can be a little intense at first, but I am a great guy once you get to know me.  I could use some basic obedience training and someone who is willing to be patient with me while I get to know them.  If you think you may be that person, be sure to contact my rescue people!\n\n~~~~\n\nPERSONALITY:\nBlake is a wary dog who will need an attentive owner willing to give him time and work with him on obedience.  He loves to run the fence and play in the water but also knows how to chill when it's time to come in.\n\n~~~~\n\nTo learn more about Blake, please visit tirrrescue.org/blake.",

When I came back, I was very fearful and would bite without hesitation or reservation if I thought something was a threat.  I ended up biting someone I thought was trying to hurt me, so my family sent me to TIRR Rescue to find a new forever home.  My rescue people think I'm finally ready to find my someone special.\n\nI get along well with some dogs, especially if they like to run and play!   However, I am very much a house dog; I don't like to spend much time outside, especially in this nasty Texas heat.  I am still very hesitant around new people.  I will need a very experienced owner who understands that I don't like strangers and will need to be monitored whenever someone is around.\n\nIf you think you could be my forever family, be sure to contact my rescue people!\n\n~~~~\n\nPERSONALITY:\nGeneral will need a very experienced owner with extensive Rhodesian Ridgeback knowledge.  He was treated badly by a trainer, and it left him fearful of new people.  He will need an owner that is willing to set him up for success - meaning no crowds and no visitors without crating him - and work with him through his fears.  He will bite if he perceives a threat and has no other means of escape. While he does have a bite history, he is very sweet and playful with the people he knows well.  Due to his background, only adopters who have previously owned Rhodesian Ridgebacks will be considered.\n\n~~~~\n\nTo learn more about General, please visit tirrrescue.org/general.",

We can only guess she has some Corgi, some Lab, some something else in her genetic pool too.  \n\nWhat matters is that she is a good gal that deserves a home. She is FREE to a good home.  She deserves a home. \n<_____________________________>\n\nDEE DOLLY DO is estimated d.o.b. 3/30/15.  She was a former stray, found with a younger male pup that was very German Shepherd in appearance. They were found in the Aquilla MO area. \n\nDolly is a playful gal, who is kenneled with an active male and female.  They play so well and eat together, no arguments. \n\nI believe she will be better in a home with medium to large males.  She is a mild alpha, so I would not place her in a home with another female unless your dog is very submissive.  No cats.  She has prey drive.  \n\nWe treated her for Heartworms.  She is in great health and is a dog who enjoys being petted..  \n\nThis poor gal has been locked in a pen here since 2017.   No interest in her and we are shocked...  Someone please give her a home.  Fenced in yard or a city home where she goes out on a leash.  She is a hunter, and was found as a stray, we think lost after a storm. So she will possibly not be loyal to your property if not contained in a fence or on a leash when out.  \n\nMature weight should be 40 pounds.  \n\nAdoption fee is $FREE.\n \nALWAYS CALL US or LEAVE YOUR TELE IN THE COMMENTS ASKING FOR MORE INFORMATION ...\n\nTo adopt call Marilyn at 573-722-3035 from 9:30am to 9:30pm CENTRAL TIME. Please leave your telephone if you send us a request to adopt so I can contact you! (:>))\n\nWe may be able to help with transport. We ship all over the USA. \n\nYou can help us by sharing posts of our dogs on your FB page and by email to friends. \n\nIf you like music, check out our SAXOPHONE CD that is easy listen music that the pets will even like!  Michael Neville donated his CD to help the pets!  Go to our Website to download single songs for $.99 cents each OR download all 13 classic tunes for just $9.99. Simple, fast to do and YOU get something back when you donate to us! \n\nYou can listen to four sample songs at this link: \nhttp://www.bcstrayproject.org/support-thru-music/ \n\nYou can also donate and get the DOWNLOAD versions at the above link! \n\nTHANK YOU for your support and for shopping for a rescue pet!",

Tripp was rescued from the Navajo nation in New Mexico in August 2017.  He has been in a couple of car accidents and his front leg was amputated.  He also has an old fractured rear leg that he needs to be cautious with.  Because of the way his rear leg has healed and the amputated front leg he has a hop-skip walk.  He needs a calm home with no stairs and carpeting or lots of rugs so he will not slip. He is very good riding in the car.  He has a good disposition and loves other dogs, he is friends with all the other dogs in his current foster home.  Tripp has good house manners and he uses a doggie door.\n\nApplication, home visit and $95 adoption fee.\n\nIf you have any questions or would like to meet/adopt/foster Tripp please email us at info@ACofAZ.org and we will contact you very soon.\n",

He loves people and is one of the most handsomest dogs we've met. He is a true beauty. His best friend is Glamour, the boxer mix. They love to stand up like two deers and have a boxing match. It is really funny and adorable to watch!  Max would make a great companion to go running, hiking, camping or to the beach with. He is up to date on vaccines, neutered and micro-chipped.

I am affectionately named so because I have bent front legs and slightly bowed back legs and the vet says it could be due to being crated as a young puppy for months in a crate that was too small or it could be a genetic condition and I was not given proper nutrition so my bones didn't form properly. Either/or the vet feels that surgery would be too painful and risky at this point. It's ok, my bent legs give me character and a sweet goofy \"Charlie Chaplin\" walk and I get along just fine. I love to run and play and when I run you can barely notice my bent legs. I'm super fun loving and sweet and friendly to all. I am good with other dogs but I am a little ackward in approach so I tend to scare small dogs a bit but I'm good with other playful young big dogs. I'm a little too interested in cats and will chase them. I think I would be best with older kids ages 10 yrs + and because of my legs it would be best for me to be in a home in the country with a grass yard so I can be on soft surfaces because of my legs. I am a very \"SPECIAL\" boy in more ways than one and I will unleash my charm on you once you meet me.. so please come meet me today!\n\nFor more info/app; please email: CECE@TAILSOFLOVERESCUE.ORG",

He had been picked up on CR 3140 on 11/8/17 weighing 30 pounds, and estimated to be 4 years old.  He was scared in the kennel at the shelter.  Once out of the kennel, he was in my lap licking my face while I was signing his release papers, good on a leash, and likes going for rides.  I have let him run around several of my dogs with no problems, but can act dominant to some other male dogs.  He will be neutered on 1/5/2018.  He has not liked going potty in his larger kennel here, so there is a chance he might be house trained, but he does like to mark areas outside his kennel here.\n\nHe is heartworm positive, and we will be doing slow kill for his treatment.  I have a page of instructions for using Ivomec for the slow kill that will go with his adoption if he is still positive when adopted.  He could be heartworm negative in 6 months.\n\nD.O.B.:     ? 2013\nWeight:     30.0 - 11/8/17\n\n$25 adoption fee.  He had donations toward his vet care.",

He has spent too much time alone.  Too much time on a chain and not enough interaction. This little man is a work in progress.  He is coming along very well.    We are hoping to change his life forever.    He loves his yard and his toys, especially balls.   Food is a super important thing in his life.  He comes running  when he's called in for dinner.   He is better with women.  Takes him awhile to warm up to men but if you have a snack, especially jerky he will be your best friend.   He is a bit rambunctious so  would not be a good fit for small children.   Chevy is so happy when he's out playing in the yard with one of his favorite people. He has a big ole smile and  a fun little personality.    He would do best as an only dog and definitely no kitties.   He would love to go hiking and camping and have lots of room to play.   He needs an inside home and a fenced yard.    Chevy is a 4 year old  Healer Pit bull mix.   He is neutered, up on all his vaccinations and micro chipped.    Please call Lorrie if you can take just a little extra time to give him a chance\n208 339 0130 or email kjfam@dcdi.net\n\n",

            "description": "Cecil was originally found at 9- 10 months old dragging a leash in Carmel, IN. Due to a diligent Good Samaritan, who tried to find his owner, Cecil's history was discovered. He and his littermate were set free as puppies by someone who no longer wanted them. A neighbor fed them on a regular basis, but was not interested in keeping them. His littermate was killed in a coyote trap, and not wanting the same fate for him, gave him to her brother.  Her brother didn't want him either and set him free in Carmel in hopes of finding a home.  He was born in March of 2017. He has displaced aggression, which means when he is riled up about seeing another dog outside his area, he can't get to it, so it bites the thing closest to him,. Walking with a muzzle solves this problem. He loves going for walks, rides well in the car and gets along well with other dogs. We believe he is a Great Pyrenees/Golden Retriever mix. He has double dew claws on his rear legs, and dark eyeliner around his eyes. He has the look of both breeds. Cecil loves to give hugs by leaning on you, but he needs his space when doing his job guarding, and does not like to be manhandled. He currently weighs about 100 lbs. He was adopted for two years, and because of the adopter's incompetence in dealing with displaced aggression, after biting the adopter on a walk, they took him to the vet to be euthanized. Fortunately the vet contacted us, since he was adopted through IGPR, and saved his life by getting him back to us. Cecil will need an experienced adopter who is comfortable dealing with displaced and high value food aggression. He is a smart boy and responds well to training. Due to his rough start in life, we believe he does have some PSTD and reverts back to those protective behaviors when in a challenging situation. He is a sweet boy, who is well behaved in the house.  He does not need to be crated when you are gone.  He does need his space when doing his guarding. \n\n He will be placed in an adult only home as an inside pet with access to visible secure fencing, Pyrs  and most pyr mixes do not do well with wireless fencing. \n\nWe recommend obedience training for all newly adopted pyrs, to help you create a special bond with you and your new friend, and so you have a well behaved canine. Great Pyrenees are willing to learn, but are not as eager to comply with commands as much as other breeds. They are bred to be independent thinkers. Applicants must be over 25, own their own home and all children in household must be over 18 years old. If you are interested in fostering or adopting Cecil, please complete the appropriate application on our website, www.igpr.org under the Adopt tab. \n\nAll of our dogs marked as needing foster homes are also available for adoption. In fostering a dog, the dog comes to you fully vetted. and groomed. You provide good quality food, grooming, and we provide the heartworm preventative and medical care, if needed* .(*Based on approval from IGPR.)\n\nWe also offer a foster to adopt program. You foster the dog, and have first right of refusal on them if an approved application is submitted for them. \n\nAdoption fee is $350",
