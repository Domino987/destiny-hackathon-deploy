            "description": "DOO DAISY DOO is a strong alpha.  She also is able to clear a 4' fence, so she needs a home where they use electric or only take their dog out on a leash for exercise.  \n\nShe is good has developed a strong desire to boss other dogs and should only be in a home as the only dog.  Good on a leash when in control but eventually in a pack she takes over and in a strong manner.  \n\nKids age 10 and older would be best, but she does love the human company.  \n\nDaisy was a stray back in May of 2019, found in northern Bollinger County.  While waiting for help from a rescue she was chained 100% of the time since they lived next to Hwy 51.  \n\nWhen with a foster she went over the kennel.  So they put a roof on it and she was content. They let her out to play and she hung around the yard for attention.  \n\nShe is at our home now and is also loyal to the yard and out with about 16 other dogs doing well, but trying to become alpha female (with no luck).  \n\nShe is hanging out at the door wanting in, making me feel she must have been an indoor dog at one time.  \n\nShe is a cutie.  She simply needs the right home to keep her safe. LOVES when I give her attention. \n\nBEST as the only dog, but again, will do well best with a submissive male. \n\nMature weight should be 25-30 pounds.  \n\nAdoption fee is $100. \n\nTo adopt call Marilyn at 573-722-3035 from 9:30am to 9:30pm CENTRAL TIME. Please leave your telephone if you send us a request to adopt so I can contact you! (:>))\n\nWe may be able to help with transport. We ship all over the USA. \n\nYou can help us by sharing posts of our dogs on your FB page and by email to friends. \n\nIf you like music, check out our SAXOPHONE CD that is easy listen music that the pets will even like!

He has been good with my husband but was a little unsure at first.\n\nCharlie has been without a home for way too long.\nCharlie was at Knox County for over 450 days when we pulled him.\nBefore that he was at Pittie Paws where the conditions were so deplorable that Knox County took all the dogs away.\nBefore that Charlie was with IHAD rescue where he was in a nice foster home with a dog and a cat but that was a long time ago.\n\nWhat I have experienced is a sweet affectionate dog who like to play with toys, lick faces, sleep and eat treats. Charlie loves car rides, walks and snuggling.\n\nI have been told many things about Charlie from lots of people that have been around him mostly at the shelter. \nI have been told he is unpredictable, aggressive, will need tons of decompression time,prefers woman, prefers girl dogs, was good with a cat, does not like strangers\n\nIf interested in Charlie please fill out an application at www.doggiedetour,.org or call me 740-251-8527\nUpper Sandusky OH\nCharlie should meet any potential dog before adoption",

            "description": "Hey, everybody! My name is Birdie. This is my second time at TIRR Rescue.\n\nI went home with a super nice family who had a couple kids and pretty active dog for me to play with. However, that just still wasn\u2019t quite enough for me. I\u2019m VERY active and I will need a VERY active family to help me burn off energy! I love playing soccer (I could chase a ball around the yard all day!), so a family with kids who play soccer would be super awesome!\n\nI would do best in a home without any other dogs. While I like playing with them, I get super jealous over my people when other dogs try to get attention from them. I can be a little nervous, and I compensate by trying to make all the big dogs think I\u2019m just as big as they are.\n\nI\u2019m really a good girl, I just need something to keep my mind busy. Playing games and going through some obedience training are just what I need! If you think you might be my forever family, be sure to contact my rescue people!\n\n~~~~\n\nPERSONALITY:\nBirdie is a great pup, but she is very active. She will need obedience training and an active family to keep her from being bored. She would do best in a home without other dogs, as she tends to get jealous when around her people.\n\n~~~~\n\nTo learn more about Birdie, please visit tirrrescue.org/birdie.",

With a few treats and kind words, Brett will become your best friend!

Brett is not a fan of car rides, but will sit quietly in a crate once you get him loaded up. This boy had the perfect home and came back to no fault of his own. We really hope Brett can be back where he is loved soon! Come meet him any day between 9 and 4 at the Haven.\n DOB 4/30/15...All pets have lifetime sanctuary at Haven of the Ozarks. If they cannot remain with their adopter, they must be returned to the Haven.\n\nAdoption fees are as follows: \nPuppies under the age of 6 months - $125\nDogs weighing 30 pounds and less - $125 \nDogs ages 6 months to 5 yrs old - $90\nDogs over the age of 5 yrs old - $75.\nCats under the age of 6 months old - $75\nCats over the age of 6 months old - $65",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Lassie is a 2 1/2 year old Pitbull and Ridgeback female. She is approximately 80 lbs and has been spayed. She is a fun, loving and playful dog. She likes when she is loved and played with, she likes chew toys and treats. She is extremely loving to small children and has never hurt anyone. She dislikes loud yelling and other dogs. She is in good health, has never had an issue with anything.\n\nI recently rescued a third dog and Lassie began being aggressive towards the other dogs. She has attacked the two others to the point of almost death. When the dogs are out of her sight, she is a sweet and loving dog to people. But we are struggling with keeping her when she is constantly attacking the other dogs. We have attempted to train her and help her for the last 8 months but it has not worked. She would be great in a single dog home. She only wants to be loved and cared for.\n\nMy contact information is 530-351-8116 and/or jmkagel3@icloud.com",

            "description": "Simba is a smart, sweet and handsome long haired boy who loves people especially his own people.    For Simba a great and happy day is just trying to please and to hang with his people or family. Simba is housebroken, does not dig or chew and is crate trained.  He gets very excited when its time to go for a walk but can be dog selective and can become defensive if he feels threatened.  He does very little barking but is very aware of what is going on around him.  He would do well with a companion dog or without one.  He could also live with older children (teenaged).  If you are patient and a stay at home person, Simba would love to meet you.\nPlease visit http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/ to learn more about our dogs. Click on available dogs to see further descriptions. If you are interested in me, please contact us at information@coastalgsrsd.org or call (858) 779-9149. Don't forget to fill out our online application:  http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/webform/1774/adoption-application. The minimum adoption donation ranges from $300 to $400. This amount only partially covers the cost of veterinary care, boarding fees, and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs and is 100%25 tax deductible. Prior to placement, all dogs will be spayed or neutered, receive current vaccinations, and are usually microchipped. If not, arrangements will be made on an individual basis. Special consideration may be given to those willing to adopt older dogs or dogs with physical problems. Our adoption process begins with completing an application on-line. A phone screening will soon follow, and lastly a home visit will be conducted by our volunteers.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Mickey is one of two dogs seized by law enforcement from horrible conditions in Oct., 2015. He was the more timid of the two dogs and is still quite shy with new people. He is now 6 years old. It does take Mickey a long time to learn to trust people. Even after 4+ years, he is still very hesitant when it comes to being touched a lot. He does seem to enjoy the company of the people he knows and loves to romp and play. He is fully vetted, neutered, and microchipped. His fee is $125.\n\nMickey will need a very patient and experienced owner who is willing to work with him at his pace. He is still a work in progress. Treats work wonders with him. He needs a secure and somewhat quiet home and does require a securely fenced yard. He DOES do well with other dogs. We think kids over 10 would be best. We have no way of testing with cats. He is our special boy!\n\nNOTE: Adoptions are done via private appointment once an application has been completed and approved.\n\nWe are located at 101 22nd St. SE in Austin, right next to the airport. It's exit 180B off of I-90, right off of 218 South.\n\nWe do require that potential adopters be at least 21 years old and that any resident dogs be up to date on vaccinations, heartworm testing/preventative, and spayed or neutered.",

Don't forget to fill out our online application:  http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/webform/1774/adoption-application. The minimum adoption donation ranges from $300 to $400. This amount only partially covers the cost of veterinary care, boarding fees, and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs and is 100%25 tax deductible. Prior to placement, all dogs will be spayed or neutered, receive current vaccinations, and are usually microchipped. If not, arrangements will be made on an individual basis. Special consideration may be given to those willing to adopt older dogs or dogs with physical problems. Our adoption process begins with completing an application on-line. A phone screening will soon follow, and lastly a home visit will be conducted by our volunteers.",

He is very excitable and does jump a lot, and he will boop your face if you aren\u2019t careful ( he\u2019s still learning all 4 paws on the floor). He is a big cuddle bug and always wants to be next to me. He absolutely loves meeting new people and dogs, and he plays well with dogs of all sizes. He is strong, so he does need two leashes on walks because he pulls (towards other dogs and things), tries to sniff everything, and sometimes will try to jump on people walking by. He is not anxious at all outside in the city, and we walk at least 5 miles every day with no issue. Chaplin is a big, happy boy who is need of a consistent training routine with a dog experienced adoptive home that would not have children under the age of 12. He could live with a canine sibling ( but no cats) who can match his rough and tumble style provided there is enough space and exercise for both pups.

The family did try to keep them, but it became too hard on them and they asked for Adore's help with finding them a new home.\n\nLacey is about 4.5 years old and approximately 80 lbs. Lacey was adopted earlier this year, unfortunately, they are looking to rehome her as she has developed severe separation anxiety and needs a home willing to put in a bit of work to help her get comfortable in a new place and routine. Lacey is great with all people and she even does well with other dogs. We are unsure how she does with cats, her foster believes she may want to chase them since she likes running after small creatures. Lacey enjoys a bit of attention and then is content to be on her own. She is pretty independent and enjoys her time outside. She has been around the neighbor's 10 year old son and does well with him.\n\nLacey is spayed, up to date on vaccinations, microchipped, and heartworm negative.\n\nAdoption or foster applications can be found at www.adorehouston.org\nEmail us at info@adorehouston.org with any further questions.",

            "description": "Jack here! I am a 2 year old, extra large husky mix. Adventure is my middle name and I'm always up for something new. I'm a young guy, full of pizazz, and I thrive with a healthy balance of play, routine, and structure. I'm looking for an adopter who has experience with my breed or with high energy type dogs. I'm best suited for a home that has experience with dog training and teaching good manners. Fortunately I'm a smart dog and I love to learn new things! I'm a bit too rambunctious for children and cats, and my big personality can be overwhelming for most other dogs.\nIf you're interested in learning more or meeting me, please submit your fully completed Dog Adoption Profile to swerning@phs-spca.org. You must be 18 or older to submit an application.\nApplication: https://phs-spca.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/AdoptionProfiles_dog.pdfUnless otherwise indicated, adoptable animals are located at our Lantos Center for Compassion at 1450 Rollins Road, Burlingame, CA 94010. Please note at this time we are doing adoptions by appointments only. Please call us at 650-340-7022 to schedule an appointment.Our hours are weekdays from 11am-6pm and weekends from 11am-5pm (closed major holidays). Interested adopters must arrive at least 1 hour before close. We do our best to update our listings regularly, but we can't guarantee every animal you see is still available. It's also typical for us to have animals who haven't had their photos taken yet, so you are welcome to visit our adoption center and have a look around!\nTo check on an animal's adoption status, please call 650-340-7022 during normal business hours to speak with an adoption counselor. Emails will be returned as soon as possible, but please allow up to 48 hours during busy adoption periods like weekends.",

At the time, she had a litter of 5 week old puppies but it was clear this was one of many many litters. She stayed with us while she nursed her pups and got back to health, and she's now ready to find her forever home. \n\nMama does well with some dogs, and not so well with others. She's been good with small and large dogs, males and females, but also had major dominance issues with dogs of all sizes, breeds and genders. \n\nWe would prefer Mama be an only dog, although she is not considered aggressive. She would do best with someone who lives a very active lifestyle. Mama loves water, swimming, boat and car rides. She listens great on/off leash and would do well hiking, exploring trails, or anything outdoors. \n\nMama loves everyone she meets including children, and she has never reacted to a person for any reason.",

No inquiries, please, without an application.\n\nShiloh is still searching for a quiet, adult only home where he can enjoy going for long or short walks, run in a fenced-in yard, or just snuggle by your side and watch the world go by. He is best with an experienced owner as your only pet and prefers to be in a home with women. Well, we guess he is simply a ladies man! Shiloh is not trusting of men. Poor boy but we know that there is a loving home out there for this handsome guy. He is best in a quiet, single-family home. Apartment life is too busy for him. Shiloh is fully housebroken, crate trained, good on a leash, takes toys, treats food gently, knows several commands, and is wondering when his chance will come at a loving, quiet, adult home? Can you be Shiloh's hero? He is a 6 yrs. old sweetheart down on his luck. Saved by Best Friend Dog and Animal Adoption, Inc. and Best Friend Thrift Shop from a local New Jersey shelter where he waited a long time to be rescued. Now, Shiloh is in his kennel in Stirling, N. J. waiting for you to adopt him. Please apply to adopt Shiloh at bfdaaa.com.",

Yes, you read that right, 4 years, half his life.  He has no idea what a home and a family is. The  shelter and shelter staff, is his home and family. Why hasn\u2019t he been adopted? Perry is misunderstood and could be called a recluse. He always hides, when someone comes along, and they never get to meet him. He is very shy, and submissive. Perry is a good leash walker, we are working on winning him over this way. Daily walks are working to gain this boy\u2019s trust. Sometimes he may let you pet him, or take a treat from you! If you\u2019re someone who\u2019s looking for a companion and don\u2019t need instant gratification, please consider giving Perry his forever home. Perry does ok with other calm dogs. A home that is calm and quiet, IS A MUST! With a little love, LOTS of patience and understanding, this diamond in the rough, could shine. ONLY HOMES WITH A PRIVACY FENCE WILL BE CONSIDERED!!!\n\nAll animals are spayed/neutered and up to date on vaccinations before going home!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting me or want further information, please fill out an application at ochumane.org.",

            "description": "Meet this handsome fella named Tank! He came originally came into the shelter January 7, 2020 when his owner could no longer keep him. He was adopted and now back as of May 2020. He needs a home without cats and small dogs.   He is  1 year  3 months old, current on shots, house broken, now neutered,  and owners said he was good with most other dogs who are friendly. He came in super scared and unsure of shelter life with nothing familiar or normal to him. This can be very common and typically with time they settle in which he has settled in very nicely! He\u2019s super handsome and once out of his scared shell he\u2019s super sweet. Needs a loving patient home that can work with him on basic puppy manners as all pups need to mature into even more amazing adult dogs and help him decompress and feel secure. Might you have the most amazing FOREVER home for sweet Tank?! Stop by for a visit with him today! \nIf you have another dog and are interested in meeting another potential new furry member please bring him or her to the shelter and meet on neutral ground before adopting. No need to shuffle the animals around any more than necessary. Please know that 1 mosquito bite can create heart worms and they can be fatal if not treated. It is VERY important to keep your pets healthy and protected by keeping them on a once a month heart worm and flea/tick prevention. These animals are counting on you as their owner to provide them with lots a love and the proper health care so PLEASE make sure you are aware and prepared before adopting. Owning a pet is an extra expense and responsibility but is so worth every minute and penny you invest in them. They will add lots of joy and unconditional love if given a fair chance.\nThe shelter is open Mon.-Fri. 10-1, 2-5 and Sat. 10-4. Adopt a homeless pet and save a life. If you can not adopt right now come out and volunteer and make a difference in the lives of these animals while they await their FOREVER home.",

For more information and the adoption application for Roxxie, please visit our website belowhttp://www.coastalgsr.org/dog_profile.php?ID=21886&name=RoxxieHave you been scouring the internet for a young, gorgeous GSD with more drive than an F-350? Do you need a dog whose ball drive is through the roof? Who will work for a ball, even if it's really only of the felt that actually makes up a ball, because that's all that's left, but she works for it like it's a Kong sized ball with a squeaker inside? Meet Roxxie!Roxxie was born May 15, 2017. She is a very high drive working dog who is as smart as they come, has an enormous ball drive, is obedience trained (knows French, German, and English commands), and is a gorgeous spitfire of a pup. She's happy to chase down balls for hours, is great on a leash, a superb hiking or running partner, and is looking for someone who understands GSDs with this kind of drive. She didn't appear to have been socialized with other dogs and was very reactive when she came to us, but has learned to be civilized around other dogs and did well in a play-group setting. She is good in the house, loves her balls and toys, and needs someone with a low traffic home and GSD experience who understands these high-drive working dogs.Roxxie has IBD, so she eats a single protein rabbit kibble (no prescription needed) and does just fine.The minimum adoption donation for adults is $375 and the adoption donation for puppies is $500. This amount only partially covers the cost of veterinary care, boarding fees, and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs and is tax deductible. The adoption donation provides that all dogs will be spayed or neutered, receive current vaccinations, and are microchipped. If not, arrangements will be made on an individual basis ( i.e., puppies who will need to be altered by 6 mos old). Special consideration may be given to those willing to adopt older dogs or dogs with physical problems.",

Marley is familiar with basic obedience commands like \"sit, \"paw\" and \"down,\" has great recall and is wonderful on a leash. \nDuring times of high excitement like getting ready to go on walks, Marley has a hard time containing himself and will often jump, but staff has been working with Marley to help him refrain from doing this. Marley loves meeting and spending time with human friends and would prefer to be the only dog in a family. He's very attentive to his people and aims to please.\n Once he's comfortable with you, his silly side comes out and you'll likely see him rolling on the ground, making silly faces and looking for belly rubs. At 9 years old, Marley is starting to get up there, but he doesn't let that slow him down. So if you're interested in a dog who you can include in some adventures, Marley may be the right fit!",

            "description": "Male Dutch Shepherd-Mastiff Mix\n\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nApproximate date of birth: 09/02/2015 \n\nWeight: 78.5 lbs\n\nChildren: No \n\nDogs: Selective \n\nCats: Doesn't mind them\n\n\nSully is a really cool dog once you've earned his trust. He is big and pretty mellow but has shown resource-guarding behavior while in our care. He will protect anything he deems as high value; this includes food, treats and his \"person.\" What's his is his! He is no bad guy though, in fact quite the opposite. Like all dogs he has a great heart but he came from a bad situation before ending up in shelter and rescue programs. With his unfortunate start to life he has developed some trust issues with humans and we can't blame him. However, once he warms up to you, he will be your best friend.\n\nSully has a sweet, playful, and affectionate side that has won over every TVR team member. One of Sully's favorite things to do is go on long walks. As soon as he sees you pick up a leash the excitement that comes over his whole body is just a vision of pure joy! He cannot wait to head out on a little adventure with you. He also has a silly side and can be a total goofball. In order to witness this cute tomfoolery, he needs to know he is completely safe and must trust you before he shows that vulnerable side of himself. Sully also likes other dogs as long as they're not too energetic or pushy with him. He wants them to respect his boundaries like he respects theirs.\n\nBecause of the resource-guarding behavior and his large size, Sully needs a home with an experienced dog owner and no children. We think he will do best in a tranquil home environment with one or two adults who understand his specific needs and boundaries. Once he finds an adopter who is willing to put in the time to gain his trust and understand him, you will never want to go on another sunset walk without Sully by your side. You will have a companion like no other.\n\nIs Sully the right guy for you?",

            "description": "Male Labrador Retriever-Husky Mix\n\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nApproximate date of birth: 10/12/2014\n\nWeight: 70.5 lbs Ideal weight: 65 lbs - 68 lbs\n\nChildren: No\n \nDogs: Very Selective \n\nCats: Unlikely\n\n\nA very experienced dog owner would be a great match for this intelligent, but quirky fellow! Farley is very sweet with his trusted friends but he can be distrustful of strangers; primarily men. Farley is also suspicious of young children (children under the age of 15) and due to his negative reaction to children he cannot go to a home with children or where children visit. Once he trusts you he absolutely loves cuddles and will seek reassurance and affection (usually in the form of a pat) from the people he values. When in a situation where he feels comfortable, he will still bark at strangers but is usually pretty quick to warm up to new people. This generally happens once he is able to come out to meet them in a calm and controlled environment with a trusted handler. \n\nWhen it comes to his dog friends, Farley is very selective. He knows at \"hello\" whether or not he likes a dog or not. If he doesn't like a dog he lets you know how he feels almost immediately. He enjoys long walks and he's terrible at fetch (don't let him know we told you that) but loves to carry a ball around like he's the MVP. Farley loves car rides and is not an annoying backset driver but a total gentleman passenger. At the end of the day when it's time to relax, his favorite pastime is a hardy bone he can gnaw on. \n\nSometimes it feels like Farley is misunderstood. He just really needs a patient and experienced dog owner to love him. He has been in the shelter and rescue environment for so long that he no longer remembers what it feels like to have a person or family of his own. Therefore, he doesn't easily form bonds with people because everyone he has been attached to, has left him behind. We truly believe with the right adopter he will thrive in a home setting! All he needs is a chance to show you what a great dog he is.\n\nAre you ready for a Farley cuddle? Can you help Farley make new, happy memories and give him a family to call his own?\n\n*HEARTWORM UPDATE: Farley has finished his Heartworm treatment and we are very happy to report everything looks good! His energy and activity level are back to normal and he shouldn't have any long term effects from the infection or treatment. It will be extra important for Farley to remain on a monthly Heartworm preventive (such as Heartgard Plus) year round and for the rest of his life. This will help lower the risk of him having to go through treatment again. We recommend all dogs be on monthly Heartworm preventive year round to try and avoid this costly treatment unless otherwise advised by your primary veterinarian.",

            "description": "Zephyr would like to submit his application to be your new best friend! Zephyr is a great mix of party-animal/outdoor adventurer, and at-home hangout companion. Zephyr is great in the house; he is housebroken, fine when left alone, and overall well-behaved. He also knows how to sit and go down, and takes treats gently. He has been working on training with his foster mom and would be eager to continue in his home! One of his favorite parts of the day seems to be evening cuddles on the couch, and he has been a great work-at-home assistant. Zephyr is very friendly with people, and has yet to meet a person he didn't like! He is charming and entertaining with his pumpkin-headed smile, big wagging tail and goofy, earnest attitude. Zephyr also loves getting out and about, and would love to be a walking, hiking or running buddy for someone up for his size and eager strength on leash.  Zephyr LOVES water, so would love to go for a wade or maybe even a swim in the summer.  But he is also happy as can be when he gets to run and play in the yard, so would love to have a fenced-in space to play fetch and do squirrel patrol (he is a little too interest in small critters, so needs a home without cats.) Zephyr is a well-rounded boy who can be active and outgoing, but also enjoys his downtime. He is around 67 lbs and 4 or 5 years old. Email limey922@yahoo.com to set up a meet with Zephyr!\nDue to COVID-19, CITY DOGS is currently doing adoptions by APPOINTMENT ONLY. Please visit www.tinyurl.com/meetacitydog to request a meet and greet! \n\n\n Hours:\n 10 AM - 3 PM Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday\n 10 AM - 6 pm Tuesday & Thursday\n\nFee: $61 | Includes spay/neuter, shots, microchip, license, 30 days free pet insurance (when registered upon adoption)\n\n  The CITY DOGS mission is to increase adoptions from the City Kennel by changing the image of the pit bulls who make up the majority of the kennel population, by preparing all adoptable dogs in the kennel for lives in loving homes and by creating as many opportunities as possible for the public to meet and get to know our dogs for the terrific pets they are meant to be.  \n Our Adoption Process...\nHere's a little about how things work:\nAll of the CITY DOGS posted for adoption are available for direct adoption from the kennel, unless noted otherwise. Some dogs with special needs may require a rescue to pull. You can either stop in during our open hours to meet a dog, or set up a meet and greet with your dog, which allows us to get the dog out of his/her cage for some exercise before you arrive. To set up a meet and greet or to inquire about a dog\u2019s special needs, please email us at citydogs@city.cleveland.oh.us.\n\nAbout Our Dogs: All available dogs have gone through a behavioral and medical assessment. This assessment is a snapshot of who the dog is at that given time. We cannot make any guarantees with regard to behavior, temperament or health of any City Dog. Most of our dogs are picked up as strays, so we do not know what kind of home environment they were living in (i.e. with kids, other dogs or other cats), nor do we know if most of them are house trained. Everything we know about them is based on volunteer and staff observations. We do have some dogs in foster homes, where they will have more information about how the dog is in a home environment. It is very hard to tell with certainty whether or not a dog will be good with kids, cats or another dog. If you have kids in the home or another dog, we do require that they be present for a meet and greet with the dog you are considering for adoption.\nHeath/Vaccinations: Dogs that are adopted directly from the kennel need to go to your personal vet within two weeks of leaving the kennel. All dogs receive their DHPP, Rabies, Bordetella and Canine Influenza vaccines, thought you may be required to get follow up boosters. All dogs come microchipped and with a Cuyahoga County license. \n",

            "description": "Hi, my name is Merry!  I am a little lover girl at around 30 pounds and 2 years old.  I was rescued near Benson after being tied to a light pole in the middle of nowhere and very rarely fed.  I have A LOT of energy, so I\u2019d really love a family who will play ball with me or take me for walks or runs.  I ride well in the car, potty trained & crate trained, I do pretty well on a leash, but if i see a cat, bird, or squirrel I really want to go play with them, so you better hold on tight!  I really love my food too.  I need slow introductions to new people and new dogs.  I really love belly rubs and when I am wore out, I will climb in foster moms lap and snore away!  I really want my furever home.  I need a family with a lot of energy and love to give.  I am known to get into trouble if left unattended, so my person really needs to be understanding and attentive. If left unattended I like to go trash digging, ripping up papers, grabbing shoes, but I really listen well if I'm caught in the act! I will likely do great with some training, which will be an offer for my new forever family.  I need a big yard for exercise and chew toys to keep my busy and happy. I\u2019m a really good girl who just needs a patient loving family to love me just the way I am! \n\nInterested in meeting Merry? Please text Gayla with Paw Project at 919-820-3217. Adoption fee is $300 and N.C. adoptions only.",

Here I am, a good lookin' 6-year-old boy who knew nothing, I mean NOTHING... being chained all those years to make babies....then I wasn't! Someone came and got me! I didn't know how scared I was until this whole new world opened up. Do you know it took an hour to get the gross black 3 inch collar they put on me when I was a puppy off??? Crazy! \n\nOHHHHH, the love (and yea, the training) that comes with being free is the best thing EVER! I discovered tennis balls...oh baby, those are so fun!! Running free feels so good too! Now I know what those deer that came so near to me felt like when I would bark and they ran...I have learned how to make people laugh and even sometimes roll their eyes when I make them think I am coming when called then POOF!, I just run right past...but don't worry...I turn right around and go to whoever needs me... so there is that. \n\n I just love my girlfriends! I love to play with them. I can get a little rough but respect when they yell at me...oh yes I do! Some of the boys bark at me...jealous I guess...and I'm not sure if I like them or not...boys can just be jerks sometimes. but I hear I am going to meet some young boys that I may be able to play with and if they are nice to me then we can play and play and play!\n\n I was, what I hear my people talk about, heartworm positive....but I guess they were surprised when they learned it wasn't bad...I was happy! I don't have any real symptoms they say and am going through slow kill treatment...they also say...and feeling ohhhhh so good! So much that they say is gobbly gook to me...but I get the gist of it all. I am very smart and learn very fast...I just want to please! \n\n So don't forget my name....that is G.U.E.R.O. ...hard G...that I do know.

Clifford can be awkward with other dogs. He is never aggressive but doesn't seem to know how to ask to play. This isn't always taken well by other dogs. Clifford will need a patient furry sibling who can teach him how to act and play. Clifford does do well with cats. He is available for foster or adoption.\n\nThe adoption fee for a dog is $100. This fee includes the dog being current on vaccinations, heart worm tested, spayed or neutered, and microchipped. The shelter is open for visitation from 10am to 5pm Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday and 10am to noon on Saturday. The phone number for the shelter is 812-376-2505",

He is an approximately 1-year-old bipedal Akita / German Shepherd mix. He is incontinent in both his bowels and bladder and needs frequent baths but he doesn't mind! He was a tri-pod for a while but due to his incontinence, his one back leg was just causing him more problems. We made the difficult decision to amputate his second back leg! While we struggled with that decision, we are confident it was the right choice for him! His personality has blossomed and he has become a completely new dog with the freedom that surgery provided him! He runs and plays with dogs of all shapes, sizes, and energy levels in his foster home and doesn't miss a beat! \n\nHe is not potty trained, for reasons listed above but he promises to pay you in love and kisses for always cleaning up his messes and keeping him clean and healthy! \n\nHe has been great with all other pets he has been introduced to and loves humans of all ages and sizes! He is a little clumsy, so small children will need to be monitored around him. He loves being showered with attention by children of all sizes, though! \n\nHe runs, jumps, rolls around, and over-all just acts like a typical 4-legged dog! He will show you all the love and affection in the world if you will give him the chance to do so! He loves to play but he would also be content to be a cuddly couch potato if that's the lifestyle his human is most comfortable with. \n\nIf you'd like more information about Luke, please E-mail muttmisfitsadoptions@yahoo.com! \n\nYou can apply to meet / adopt this incredible pup at www.muttmisfits.com/adoption-application\n\n",

He was brought into an emergency veterinary clinic after being found alone with large burn wounds along his back and the top of his head.  With the help of the community, Landon has received the medical care he required and though he may be physically scarred from his experience, he is full of fun, joy, and love and holds no harsh feelings from his injuries.  He has lots of energy and enjoys running and playing and giving lots and lots of kisses.  He would be right at home with an active family who also enjoyed running or playing outside.  While he\u2019s been healing, he\u2019s also been learning some new tricks like sit and stay which he thinks are really nifty to show you\u2026 especially if you have a treat waiting for him.  He will need some more loving guidance to learn more, but he\u2019s very smart and catches on quickly.  Landon\u2019s energy and love may be a bit much for small pets and children but he would absolutely adore the opportunity to be your best friend.  Please contact us to find out more about Landon or to apply for adoption.",

            "description": "Buster is an awesome boy who would love a forever home with someone who likes to play! Buster is full of energy and loves to go on walks/runs. Buster walks great on leash. He would enjoy an adopter who would take time with him, maybe show him how to fetch a ball or play frizbee. He enjoys any type of toy or treat. Although Buster does not like the company of other pets, he makes up for this with his loyal love for people. He would do well in a home with older children (8+) - not because of aggression, but due to his energy level. \n\nAll dogs adopted through Troy Animal Rescue Project are up to date on vaccinations, spayed/neutered (age appropriate), and heartworm negative. All dogs are given monthly flea/tick preventative, monthly heartworm preventative, and are dewormed regularly. Dogs adopted through Troy Animal Rescue Project are microchipped. Adoption fee is $50. Home visit and vet reference required. Applications can be put in online at http://www.troyanimalrescueproject.org/adopt.php or in person at our rescue center.\n\nThe address for our rescue center is 34 County Road 2266, Brundidge, AL 36010. We are one turn off Hwy 167. If you use Google maps, type in Troy Animal Rescue Project and it will take you right to us. Hours of operation are from 10-3 daily. We are open Saturdays and Sundays. No appointment necessary for pets that are located at the rescue center. Appointments must be made to visit pets in foster homes. Appointments can be made by calling 334-508-2367 or emailing troyanimalrescueproject@gmail.com. Location information will be listed beside the pets name if they are at a location other than our rescue center.\n\nQuestions can be emailed to troyanimalrescueproject@gmail.com or call 334-508-2367.",

            "description": "This adorable little girl came to ARF in 2011 and has been winning us over with her smile ever since! Her cute, wrinkly smile is complemented by a sleek, velvety soft coat. At right around 30 lbs, she'd be a perfect lap companion, as she is very submissive and loves people. But don't let her mild demeanor fool you: this girl if FULL of personality! She gets bursts of energy and will take to tearing around the yard, her springy back legs outrunning her front - hilarious! This little baby will need plenty of exercise, but that shouldn't be much of an issue, as she recently spent an active day with one of our volunteers and did great. Yes, this sweet pup is the total package, but she will need to be an only dog. She tolerates other dogs, but often resorts to unfriendly behavior when left alone. We envision her in an active household looking for a smaller dog that can immediately become a part of the family.",

This handsome fellow shares a name with the Pats starting LT, Nate Solder. Like Mr. Solder, our little Nate is an amazing athlete! He loves to sprint and jump around - this is one athletic dog. He'd be perfect for an active family, but will need plenty of human interaction and a secure fence in his backyard. Our Nate tips the scales at a manageable 50 lbs., well shy of Mr. Solder's 320 lbs... but his loving heart is just the same size! Nate was found on Holly Bush Road 2011, the same year of Mr. Solder's rookie season in the NFL. It seems hard to believe that it's been nearly 4 years (I'm sure Mr. Solder would agree) but it's time to find our sweet Nate a home. If this adorable, energetic fellow seems like your type - or if you're a diehard Pats fan - be sure to share his profile.",

His starfish volunteer likes to carry him like a baby because well he lets her and he likes to show the other dogs how much he gets cuddled. Once he is outside he thrives! He loves to walk on the leash and he warms up pretty quickly (30 minutes and you might be his new best friend). Glen likes other dogs and has been tested with small dogs and didn't seem to notice they were playing while he was exploring the play area. He was in the same kennel as his sister for the first two years of his life and if she didn't decide to tattoo his ear he would still be with her. He misses that companionship in a friend or side kick. He's such a sweet boy and is looking for his forever home that will help bring out his confidence with a little love and affection. Please come meet Glen Fry!",

This sweet pup, her mother and sister (Rhianna & Jordin Sparks) were found wondering the streets several years ago. Beyonce is the largest of the three and is the only one that has beautiful light brown markings near her feet. Beyonce weighs around 65 pounds and we believe she is a Lab/Shepard mix. She has cute black spots on her tongue, but remember that labs and shepherds are some of the 30+ breeds that have colored tongues -- it's not just for Chow Chows anymore! She is a very sweet dog that is a bit shy at first, but once in the yard has no problems being hugged and loved on. Beyonce the singer has no problem finding herself in the spotlight, and everyone at ARF wishes her good luck tonight at the Grammys..... but as a black lab in a shelter, our Beyonce is constantly trying to stand out from the crowd. This sweet pup has been passed over too many times, but we know she can be a winner. After all, a home for a shelter dog is the biggest award of all! Please help us promote Beyonce and make this her big night!",

            "description": "As many of you know, we continue to run at full capacity here at the new shelter location on Mayes Street. The new dog pens have succeeded in keeping our rescue animals warm, dry, and safe this winter. The only unfortunate component of this is that we very literally do not have any room to spare. While adoptions continue at a modest pace, it's not enough to offset the steady stream of dogs that we are asked to take. These constraints force us to turn away a number of animals. but there are times where exceptions have to be made. Mayesie is one of those exceptions.\n\nMayesie was brought to us by her \"owners\", who could no longer deal with the nuisance of having a dog around. Except, or course, that Mayesie isn't a nuisance at all. She is energetic, playful, affectionate all these things and more despite having a 4 foot piece of rope that had become embedded in the skin of her neck. Despite not having any room for the dog, we were happy to take Mayesie and her \"owners\" were happy to be rid of her. They didn't even ask for the rope back.\n\nWe're so pleased that Mayesie is now in a warm, safe place. Still, we're disheartened because - although she gets multiple daily walks and attention - she's doesn't have a pen of her own. It's obvious that she deserves so much more, and we hope that you can find it in your heart to open your home to her. If your home is not right for Mayesie, we encourage you to come by the shelter and spend some time with her. She loves getting to meet new people and loves any excuse to get to play outside. Come see her today!",

She was also a fluffy, golden sprite of a dog, and was quickly adopted once her pups got to a self-sufficient age. Though her sweet pups are now grown, not a single one has been adopted from ARF. Beaver is one of these dogs, a sweet pup that has spent his entire life at the shelter. Beaver is truly charming, with a gorgeous black and chestnut coat. Like many puppies that only know the shelter life, he is very close with his siblings but somewhat less certain about people. Yet given his calm demeanor and curious disposition, we have no doubt that he will quickly bond with new family members. Beaver is fairly small, weighing in around 30 lbs, and would be a perfect fit for any family. This dog has spent the first 3 years of his life at the shelter -- let's not prolong his stay a day longer.",

Scared and in bad condition, he was immediately grateful for his new home and has been smiling ever since! Duke is an absolute sweetheart with both people and other dogs. He is a gentle, happy, loving dog that adores running around outside. While the scars on his face tell the story of a rough past, his future is bright and we are certain the right family is out there. Please help us promote our dog of the day by sharing this post and telling your friends and family about him. Duke never goes a day without giving us big smiles from his pen. but we look forward to all the smiles he will give a family in a forever home. Lets find this dog a family!!!",

            "description": "After approximately 7 years chained up, sweet King has been rescued and is looking for his new home! His friend, Bear was recently adopted but King is still at ARF. We are hopeful to find a fantastic home for this fun-loving fellow! King is absolutely yearning for a family of his own!\n\nKing is a sweet dog that craves attention.... the attention he so richly deserves after living on a chain for so long. Despite a rough start, and thanks to the Monroe Street Animal Clinic, King quickly learned to walk on a leash with his new human friends. More than anything else, he loves to run and romp in the play yard, free from that burdensome chain. His only abiding fear is that of flying bugs -- the poor thing is terrified of them after roughing it for so many years. King is neutered, up to date on shots, and has a clean bill of health. It is not always a sure thing that chained dogs will reciprocate the love of their rescuers, but King has paid us back in spades! He adores any attention that he receives, happily leaping into your arms for the extra scratch. He'd make a great fit in many homes, ideally with someone who will take advantage of his healthy energy level, but we have no doubt that this survivor will bond quickly with any family that takes him in.\n\nFor many more photos of King, to include the photos of when he was chained up, click here: https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10155558324135424.1073742006.494663480423&type=3",

            "description": "This sweet honey bear is Geoffrey, who arrived at ARF as a puppy in 2006. Yes, 2006! Unfortunately he's still at the shelter, sharing a pen with his little sister Buddha. Geoffrey is an absolute sweetheart who adores his sister and any people who come to visit. He's very tolerant of Buddha's sneaky sibling slights, such as nibbling on his ankles or using her superior speed to steal his tennis balls. This modest temperament suggests he'd be a tremendous family dog. His activity level rises well above that of most dogs his age, as he loves to run around in the grassy play yard and chase down toys. He hasn't quite learned to walk on a leash yet, and this can be somewhat of a challenge due to his thick-set, 75 lbs. frame. However, given how much he likes spending time with people, we expect him to learn to leash-walk in pretty short order. Geoffrey has a couple other siblings still at ARF, but if he's YOUR pick of the litter, come visit him today!",

She has a quiet demeanor, but is still a very active dog and is always ready for a long walk. Although shy at first, Lady warms up to people quickly.

            "description": "Way back in 2008 we saw this very pregnant pup wondering around the Belhaven neighborhood in Jackson. The pup was in bad shape and it was clear she was trying desperately to find shelter so she could settle in and have her babies. Well, ARF took her the ranch, gave her a nice warm bed and a BIG bowl of food. It wasn't 15 minutes after she arrived that she went into labor. That was November 21, 2008. can you remember where you were in November 2008? Seems like a long time ago, doesn't it. and it seems like an especially long time to still be at the ranch. Most of this litter has since been adopted, but two sweet dogs have been looked over time and time again. Meet Greta, a sweet and gorgeous pup. Ever since she was born at the shelter she constantly looks for someone to take her home. Greta has had 3 birthdays with us, and each year we wish that she could have a family that would spoil her on her birthday, and love her every day in between. Her birthday is coming up. again.. and we fear that, again, she will spend it without a family.\n\nGreta is approximately 45 pounds, spayed, and up to date on shots. She is shy at first, but it doesn't take long for her to open up and show you just how wonderful and sweet she is. She loves to walk and does very well on a leash. Please consider giving Greta the very best birthday present this year: a home.",

            "description": "Pet of the Day: Cleopatra!\n\nCleopatra was found in April 2012 nursing two puppies that at the time we questioned were even hers. She and the pups were in bad shape and were doing everything they could to survive. Once we took them in, Cleopatra nursed those puppies into good health as we nursed her back to good health. Even after those pups were too old to nurse we caught her still being a mom. One morning we came to the shelter to find that she had managed to get into the pen next to her, filled with a young litter, and was nursing them too! Once a mom, always a mom, I guess!\n\nCleopatra is a remarkably happy, sweet, and submissive pup. Even when she isnt smiling, she still has a very happy smirk on her face. She isn't very large, but is very strong (sounds like a few mothers I know!). Cleopatra has one of the softest coats of our dogs at the shelter and she loves to be touched and snuggled! She's good on a leash and loves to run and play in the yard- especially when the grass is long!\n\nAs many moms do, she has put the kids ahead of herself for too long! It's her turn now! We are happy to introduce to you..... CLEOPATRA! Please share her story so we can spotlight her and find her a home!\n\nFor more photos click here! https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10152075853065424.900717.494663480423&type=3 2/1/21 6:01 PM",

            "description": "This is Shamrock!\n\nShamrock is 8-years-old and was rescued from San Diego Humane Society. He became a Frosted Face on July 31, 2019. From day one, we knew Shamrock would be challenging to place. Our generous FFF supporters rallied to raise money for training, behavioral consultations, and his Molly & Me Project incentive (see info below.) Our volunteers signed up for biweekly hikes and outings for enrichment. We've learned a lot about Shamrock during his time with us, but one thing is for sure: Shammers needs a family as special as he is!\n\nBecause Shamrock has been at Frosted Faces for well over a year, many of our volunteers have made a point to spend extra time on him and even take him on outings. One of these volunteers noticed how much Shamrock loves to play soccer and brought him the best present: a bright green soccer ball of his very own with his name written right across it so no one else could mistake it for theirs. She told us, \"You know that quirky friend who you weren't sure about at first? But you gave them a chance and realized how funny, loving and special they truly are. That's Shamrock! He loves to play, give you kisses and be silly. He just needs you to give him some time so he can be his true self. He more than deserves a real home and his own person who will love him with an open heart.\"\n\nFor a guy who can be challenging to get to know, Shamrock sure has a lot of people rooting for him! Another volunteer shared, \"Shamrock has a unique style and charm that he keeps hidden behind a hard outer shell. But for those with a bit of patience, curiosity, and willingness to give him a chance, he slowly allows that harder exterior layer to crack open revealing his beautiful, sweet inner core. An inner beauty full of adventure and a yearning for companionship. He has the most brilliant and shockingly clear hazel eyes, the sweetest little snore when he sleeps, a cute head tilt when he's curious, and the most adorable soft-sounding bark when he's excited. A soccer pro, beach enthusiast, and an occasional hiker. Simply said - he's perfect.\"\n\nShamrock went on a two-week Frosted Fling that turned into a Foster home. For as crazy as Shamrock was in his kennel at FFF, he's a pretty mellow dude in a home. His Foster Mom reports that he sleeps during the day while she works and then is energetic for long walks. He is potty trained and can hold it overnight for 12 hours. They have shared many fun adventures together! Shamrock loves going to the beach for walks and swims in the ocean, and he's also enjoyed hikes in the mountains. Shamrock can be nervous around new people, but as he learned to trust his Foster Mom and has gotten so much better at making friends, including male and female housemates. We are so thrilled to see how Shamrock has transformed with love, patience, and consistency.\n\nHis Foster Mom shares, \"Shamrock has been acting more and more like a real dog, socialized and able to bond. His personality has evolved a lot over the past 6 months. At first, he was angry, anxious, and scared. I just gave him space and time to feel comfortable and gain trust. A lot of exercise and outings helped. He has a fun spirit. He let's out cute little barks when he's happy and wanting to communicate that he's excited for a walk or dinner. It makes me smile knowing he's more than ready for his forever home. He's a very special dog who brings so much joy to life!\"\n\nShamrock has come so far and is now ready for family! Apply to meet him at : www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nShamrock is is eligible for a $200/month paid foster through the Molly & Me Project.\n\nYou can learn more at: www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/mollymeproject\n\nVisit us at Open House: Saturdays & Sundays, 10 am - 1 pm\n\nLearn more about our programs at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family. No adoption fees and we help with medical costs!\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\nUpdated: 1/31/21 KG\n\n2/2/21 6:21 PM",

            "description": "Hi.  My name is Duckie.  I'm a cute young dalmatian cattledog mix girl about 3 yrs old who ended up in the East Valley LA City shelter in Van Nuys.  Not a fun place!  Luckily Dalmatian Rescue saw me and got me out of there before something bad happened.  I am a happy girl now, living with a group of dogs so I can play pretty much non-stop.  Perfect for a busy busy girl like me.  I am being walked daily so  I am learning my leash manners.   I am shy with strangers but I warm up quickly once I know you are friendly.  I am a nice smallish size, only 36 lbs.  I am spayed, vaccinated and microchipped so I am ready to go home anytime.  Because I am so shy, i would be best in a home without young children but another dog or two would be great.  A dog knowledgeable owner, preferably one familiar with high energy dogs like myself, would be preferred. I am still learning all of the rules but I know, in the right home with the right owner I would become just the most perfect pup ever.  I would sure like that chance!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting me, please contact Dalmatian Rescue of Southern California, Inc. by email at dalrescue@sbcglobal.net.  Rescue requires completion of an adoption questionnaire to make sure I would be a good fit for you and your family, but once completed and approved, arrangements can be quickly made for you and your family to come meet me.  I have not found my new home yet but I know it will be soon.\n\nTo learn more about Dalmatian Rescue of Southern California, Inc., a 501c3 non-profit charity, and to see all of our available dogs, please visit our website at www.dalrescuesocal.com.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website. All of our dogs and cats are in foster homes and we have no paid staff. If you have questions concerning a specific animal, PLEASE fill out an application and the foster parent will be in touch. We will not arrange any home visits with any of our dogs and cats until your application is processed. Please understand our foster parents are precious to our 2nd Chance family; without them we cannot function, so we do our best to not burden them with multiple appointments. Our foster parents will choose their top 3 applications and arrange home visits with these applicants. The adopter will be chosen at that time. The process can take anywhere from a week to a month. We want to make sure our little furry ones are placed in their 'forever home' and never have to go through a rehoming again!My story had a sad start. I lived with a family that didn't really value me :( They never bothered to get me spay'd so I ended up pregnant. I know I should have been more careful but what's a girl to do if her family doesn't keep her safe?! Any way I ended up giving birth one night by myself. If was REALLY scary and I was running around and 3 puppies dropped out but a 4th one was stuck halfway out and I was all alone and didnt know what to do. Then my family came home and I don't know what happened but the police came and those guys seemed to care more than my family. I heard them keep saying we have to do something before she dies! The were on their phones making calls and they called both emergency hospitals in Harrisburg and neither would help without payment :( WOW :(\n\nThen one of the cops called his wife who is also a cop and she said 'Let me call Lynn at 2nd Chance'. Next thing I knew she came to the house and picked me up (with my 3 puppies), but I still had the 4th one stuck inside me. We took a drive to York and then I was at a hospital and they were very nice and took care of me, but it was very sad that my 4th puppy didn't survive.\n\nThe nice lady put me back in her car and took me to this place they call 'The Ranch'. It was such a nice place! The people there got us nice soft bedding and a warm room and food and water and took care of all of us until our Foster Mommy 'stepped up' and took my little family in.\n\nMy foster mommy is super sweet and she takes really good care of us. She makes sure we always have baths and smell good and I'm done feeding my babies now so I get to run around the house with my foster mommies 2 dogs and it is SOOOOO fun!!!!\n\nI want to go to a home with another playful, small dog that will love to play with me too since my foster mommy says she can't keep me because she has to save more lives like mine. I think that is really cool even though I will miss her :)\n\nUPDATE FROM FOSTER MAMA: Harper deserves to be at a home where she will be treasured for being the awesome little dog that she is! Watching how she was with her puppies, earns her a 'Mom of the Year Award'! Harper was super attentive with her puppies and spent all of her time taking care of their needs -- even when they got older. She completely trusted us to care for her babies and never showed us the least amount of aggression while doing so. She gave everthing she had to them and now that they have found new homes, she is actually relaxing a bit more and enjoying more cuddle time.\n\nShe's quite playful and loves other dogs, and when she greets us, she jumps up and down then rolls on her back with a big goofy smile that melts your heart. She can be a bit protective and barks when strangers come over but she sits down and lets them pet her once she knows we are ok with them.\n\nWe absolutely love this little dog and think she's one of the best we've ever seen! If you are looking for an obedient dog with a sweet disposition and Yoda ears, well then she's the dog for you!\nPlease fill out an adoption application:\nAdoption application (Dog)\nAdoption Application (Cat)\n\nPlease understand we do not adopt out dogs to\nfamilies with children under the age of 5. We do not adopt dogs to renters. Some dogs will have fence requirements while others may not.\n\nA pet is a lifetime commitment. The dogs and cats in our system find themselves there, for the most part, because their humans did not have the same loyalty to them as they did to their owners. We do not take the adoption process lightly, and will do everything in our power to make sure the animal is placed correctly the first time around for your sake and theirs. Thank you for choosing to adopt not shop!",

She used to roam around his very large fenced-in property during the day and loves to have room to stretch her legs. She misses her dad very much and would love to find a new family to love. She is friendly and loves to be with her people. Holly has very soft fur, and she's the perfect size for hugs. \nHolly needs to find an experienced home with a strong leader who can make her feel safe. She's a very sweet girl. If you're looking for a wonderful and loyal companion, please consider Holly.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION: www.tinyurl.com/IADRAdoptionApp\n\nIf you'd like to help Holly while she searches for her very own family, you can sponsor her for only $19/month here: https://petbucks.org/pet/6075/sponsor/create\n\n\n***IMPORTANT- PLEASE READ***\nThe State of Texas requires rescues to collect sales tax on any adoption fees. Our adoption fee is $175. Texas State Sales Tax will be added to that amount.\n\nDue to the nature of our adoption process, our fosters are usually only able to consider forever families within a reasonable driving distance of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. A vet reference and trial adoption will be done before finalizing the adoption. Thank you for your understanding.",

He is now back as of January 21, 2021 when he and the other dog in the home were having tiffs. She was older and didn\u2019t want to play like bubba does. Bubba is now 2 years 6 months old, current on shots, neutered, house broken, and just a sweet handsome fella. Good size too 47 pounds. We were told he gets along well with children and most other dogs that share similar energy levels. He loves to go for runs too.  He\u2019s a happy fella who is full of unconditional love to share just needs a person or family to give him a chance. Bubba is a volunteer favorite and one volunteer said \u201cthis pup is wonderful and wants to please and make just make you happy.\u201d Just a delightful boy who is full of unconditional love to share.  Might you have the most perfect FOREVER home for handsome Bubba?! \nIf you have another dog and are interested in meeting another potential new furry member please bring him or her to the shelter and meet on neutral ground before adopting. No need to shuffle the animals around any more than necessary. Please know that 1 mosquito bite can create heart worms and they can be fatal if not treated. It is VERY important to keep your pets healthy and protected by keeping them on a once a month heart worm and flea/tick prevention. These animals are counting on you as their owner to provide them with lots a love and the proper health care so PLEASE make sure you are aware and prepared before adopting. Owning a pet is an extra expense and responsibility but is so worth every minute and penny you invest in them. They will add lots of joy and unconditional love if given a fair chance.\nThe shelter is open Mon.-Fri. 10-1, 2-5 and Sat. 10-4. Adopt a homeless pet and save a life. If you can not adopt right now come out and volunteer and make a difference in the lives of these animals while they await their FOREVER home.",

She does best with adults she knows and trusts, and she enjoys being around those in her inner circle. \nSasha was born in 2011. She currently lives in a foster home with a Best Friends animal behavior consultant and will need to find a special home with a mature and dog-savvy person who can continue working with her. Since she has shown aggression toward other dogs and cats, Sasha cannot live with other animals. \nSasha gets anxious when she is left alone. She will jump fences, and may even chew through them. She is able to break out of crates as well. Sasha likes to play with toys and go for walks. She is looking for a home where she'll be safe and secure and where the right person will love and care for her.",

He also walks very well on a leash! When you are done for the night and you just want to cuddle and watch some TV, Duke will be right there next to you watching too!!\n\nDuke has a few special needs, which have made finding the right home challenging. Duke prefers quiet surroundings and would do best in a low activity home with no children under 12 years old. He can be reactive to outside noise, so a single family home is a better fit than an apartment or townhouse. He does need a fenced yard to run off energy and/or someone willing to consistently take him on 2 or 3 walks a day, every day. He is on medication for anxiety and for allergies, and may always need these medications. He may also require special food to help manage his allergies. He becomes anxious in a crate and would do better in a home where he does not need to be crated often.\n\nDuke does get along well with female dogs his own size, so applicants with larger female dogs will be considered.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Duke visit charlottespca.org/adopt/ .\n\n***Because our rescue is composed entirely of volunteers and we require a home check for each of our adoptable pets prior to them going to their new homes, local applications will take precedence. We will accept out of town applications, but any family further than 60 miles from Charlotte will be responsible for finding a representative of a rescue local to them that is willing to perform the home check. All out of town applicants will also have to be willing to drive to Charlotte to meet/pick up the pet as soon as the application is approved.***\n\n2/2/21 10:01 AM",

            "description": "Such a handsome young man, this is Denver, a 4 year old male Boxer/Labrador mix. He has such a striking smooth black brindle coat with white on his chest. Denver is a large dog weighing 53 pounds and he is in great shape.  \n\nDenver had been pulled a couple of years ago by us from our local shelter where he had been down there for 4 months. He was such a good dog at the Shelter, they used him as their behavior test dog with other dogs! We adopted him out over 2 years ago but unfortunately he was returned. He was well loved and cared for but the owner had to move and was no longer able to take to free dog day care to get his energy out. He had to be left during the day in a crate and Denver could not tolerate that.  \n \nThen we adopted him out again to a wonderful home with 4 young kids all under the age of 10.  Denver did just fine with all the kids, no issues there.  But all that activity, noise, etc. seemed to cause stress and anxiety for Denver.  According to the Mom, he was anxious and usually didn\u2019t want to really stay where all the kids were.  He was great during the day when he and the other dog were just there or just the adults were there but they could tell he could not relax when there was so much activity going on in the home.  They feared they were causing him more harm than good.  So Denver is again back with us.\n \nHere what they said about Denver in this home:\nHe is very good riding in the car and on a leash.  Denver is a good watchdog and will bark when someone approaches the door.  He enjoys running and likes to chase other dogs and be chased by friends. Denver will chase cats but doesn\u2019t attack them.  He\u2019s a great dog but be warned:  he will get stuff off the counters if he can reach it!! And he will get things out of your sink, dishes, thawing meat, cups, etc.\nDenver is a very social, sweet, fun-loving active dog. He loves walking, hiking, swimming, dog parks and of course belly rubs and coach cuddling. He seems to do just fine with other dogs, cats and children. Now sometimes he doesn't like to share his toys with other dogs so will need to watch that.\n\nDenver is a super dog but he just doesn't like being crated for a long period of time - that is most of the day and all night. He will do best having a yard to run around and play in during the day or for a good part of the day (or dog day care) and then can be crated at night for sleeping. He is active and will need to get that energy out of him. He is too big and active for an apartment.  Denver\u2019s next home will be a calmer home with either no or adult children.  He will require a fenced in yard.  \n\nDenver is up to date on his vet care, neutered,\nheartworm negative and is microchipped. He is on heartworm and flea/tick prevention. Thank goodness dogs are so adaptive and live in the moment - this will help Denver as he adjusts to his new situation and then to another new home!\n\nAll HSWA dogs are either at our Dog Adoption Facility or in foster homes. All dogs require an appointment to meet.  Please call us at 205-554-0011 or email humaneswa@yahoo.com to request an appointment to see the dog/puppy and to check availability.\n\nVisit us on Facebook! www.facebook.com/humaneswa\n\nOur adoption fee is $75.  Read more information on our adoption process at www.humanesocietyofwa.org/howtoadopt.html.  Then, if you feel your home might be the right forever home and you would like to adopt a dog, submit an online adoption application. The online applications may not work on mobile devices.

She\u2019s potty trained, is good on a leash, and will use a puppy pad. She is very energetic for a 12 year old. Ahe plays with others and loves the outside. She\u2019s very shy at first but then will cling to you and follow you everywhere. She\u2019s good with dogs and cats. She is utd, hw neg (tested below detectable levels) and spayed. \n\nAll dogs have a $175 adoption fee which includes vet check, age appropriate shots (atleast 2 sets for puppies), dewormer, heartworm test (if over 6 months), rabies (if atleast 16 weeks) and spay/neuter! Puppies will be altered before adoption. All rescues and shelters practice pediatric spay and neuter. This is essential in our rescue efforts and it is a policy that we will stick by. All dogs over 8 weeks and 2 pounds will be altered before adoption. There are no exceptions to this rule on all healthy and adoptable dogs. \n\nPuppies/Dogs that are not available for adoption due to vetting not being complete can be reserved with an approved application and a non refundable $50 deposit. This deposit is applied to your adoption fee and the remaining $125 is due at pick up.\n\nWags and Whiskers is an all-volunteer rescue. We also have full-time jobs and Families. We will try to answer all questions and applications in a timely manner. Please be patient and bear with us . Do not contact Parkway Animal Hospital as they are a vet clinic and can not answer questions on behalf of Wags and Whiskers. All questions and comments must go directly through the rescue. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION\n\nhttps://form.jotform.us/70898112177159\n",

Baloo loves walks and rolling in the grass. He shows affection once trust is built. Baloo is available for the Paw Kindness Forever Foster Program which means all of his expenses are covered for life by the rescue. That includes all medical, food, beds, and anything else Baloo needs. All you have to do is provide a safe home environment for this guy to retire. Baloo needs an adult only home with an experienced handler as he can be a little bossy. He takes medication for his arthritis (provided by rescue) and is otherwise in good health for an old man of 12 years. Baloo has lived a hard life and deserves love, dignity, and a home in his twilight years. Please considering giving him a helping paw. Call or text Lidia at 480 206 3883 for questions or a meet and greet with Baloo.",

Jasper startles easily at sudden noises or movements  \u2013 but he is also curious and wants to see what made the noise or movement.  He is a quick learner and is already used to the noises made by our washer, dryer, kettle, coffee maker and printer. He will need  work on continuing his socialization.  He needs a home with no other pets. \n \nJasper is very playful with stuffed squeaky toys and balls and likes to play outside in the foster home's yard.  Jasper is becoming more comfortable on walks but is reactive to noises and dogs that he meets.  He will need someone who can work on this or have a good sized yard where he would get most of his exercise.\n.\nHe is reliably housetrained and is non-destructive in the house, but he is also crate trained.....just doesn't need it at this point.\n\nJasper is a smart boy and is now learning basic commands like sit, come with his foster mom.  He needs someone who is experienced with fearful dogs and who has the time, patience and knowledge  to work on this.\n\nThis boy has the making of a great companion to the right family who has experience with fearful dogs and is willing to work with him and will accept his idiosyncrasies.\n\nJasper fun facts....\n\n1)  Jasper loves \u201cfoot rubs\u201d \u2013 not the kind where you rub his feet with your hands \u2013 but the kind where you rub him all over with your feet;\n\n2)  Jasper loves to chase sunbeams and prisms and the movement of shadows on the wall.  He will play with his foster dad for 5-10 minutes following the sunbeam from his watch around the room each morning.  If he sees a prism on the wall, he watches the movement \u2013 and the same with the movement of shadows on the wall....and  has such a look of wonderment as he does it!\n\n3)  Jasper isn\u2019t afraid of thunder.  He will bark when he hears the noise, but he is not cowering in the bathtub.  In fact, he goes looking for the source of the noise.\n\n4) Jasper snores.  Not loud in your face snoring \u2013 just audible happy snuffley snoring.\n\n*****PLEASE NOTE THAT DUE TO COVID 19 WE ARE NOT CURRENTLY CONSIDERING CROSS BORDER ADOPTIONS.\n***********************************************************\n\n*****If you have a securely fenced yard and are interested in adopting JASPER or any of our dogs, the first step is to complete an Adoption Application at www.sosr.ca/apply-to-adopt so that we can determine whether you and your family are a good match for one of the dogs. If we have a possible match, you would then have a telephone interview, speak to the foster mom, have a home visit by one of our volunteers and vet reference check.",

            "description": "Hi there, I\u2019m glad to see you checking out my page! I\u2019m Beckham Barkley and it\u2019s great to meet you. I\u2019m looking for a new family to call my own! Could it be you?\n\nHere\u2019s my stats:\nPossible Breed:  Chihuahua Shih Tzu Mix\nGender:  Male\nColors:  Black and White\nAge:  9 years young\nWeight:  10 pounds\n\nNow for the good stuff!-\n\nSo I am really a striking dog. My color and my hair make me unique! My foster mom says that I may be a little dog but I have a BIG personality (as do most Chihuahuas). \n\nHey, know what I really love? Laps! I love to sit on laps so if you are looking for a companion to hang out with you and, be close to you, I'm your guy!   I love to get petted too.  If I see a hand dangling like they want to pet, I'll run up and ask for my share of pets.  I love, love, love attention!\n\nI do need to tell you that I can be possessive of my food bowl. Ya know, living without enough food before I got to Lone Star, can make a fellow worry. So it would be best if I live in a house without little kids because they wouldn't really understand to stay back when I'm eating. And I would never want to get carried away and nip a little kid. So best that I live with teenagers or adults! \n\nWhen I came to LS, I had mange but it's been under control for a long time. If I have a flair up, there's a bit of medication I can take to get back on track. Otherwise, I'm healthy.\n\nStart the process of adopting me or one of the other pups by filling out the application found at www.shihtzu-rescue.com.\n\nPS. I've had ALL my vetting, and oh boy, it was a lot. Here's what I had done..\nDistemper/Parvo shots - TWICE (Foster Mom said we have to have two so that we are protected from these horrible viruses. One doesn't cut it.)\nBordetella shots - ALSO TWICE. \nSpay/Neuter, of course.\nA fecal exam so I don't have any bad worms.\nA heartworm test.\nBLOODWORK to make sure my liver and kidneys are working well, because you know, we doggies often have issues in the liver and kidneys.\nA DENTAL exam AND cleaning if I needed it- yep, all my toofies are checked so they can be in tip top shape\nSee, that's a LOT. Ask your vet - that's a LOT.\n\nYou can apply to adopt this adorable little fluff at www.shihtzu-rescue.com.  This adorable little fluff has been spayed or neutered, is up to date on all vaccinations and heartworm negative.",

Mister is very well potty trained and knows basic commands such as sit , stay and down. He loves people and everywhere he goes people stop to say hello including little kids ( he\u2019s a beautiful boy and they all love his brindle coat and sweet spirit). \n\nHe is quite strong so a handler who knows how to work with his size is recommended . In his foster home, He loved to play with the little dog at home but he may come off as intimating or pushy to larger dogs .  Mister provids days full of laughter , goofiness and wonderful company and would make an amazing companion. Very good in his crate and can be left alone for a few hours at a time with no problems at all especially if he was in the crate to calm him down . A strong handler is recommended as he can be stubborn on walks and when returning home so more training would be a definite plus . \n\nTo adopt please apply online at foac.us",

There's a treatment that is not as hard on the dog as the one you may have heard of and it's FREE.\n\nWe answer all emails back within 48 hours. Please watch your spam folders as an application will be attached and this sometimes places it in there. \n\nHIS/HER adoption fee is $550 USD and that will pay for TRANSPORT, all his/her shots up to date, neutered/spayed, microchip and rabies.\n\nPlease e-mail MuttsAndMeows@Mail.com for an adoption application. \n\nThis dog is currently in the Houston Texas area.  Once the application is approved and adoption fee paid, transport will be arranged.\n\nBecause this adoption will be without meeting the dog first, we will need to try to be extra careful that everyone (including you) think this will be a good fit.  We will try to give you as much information about the dog as we can.  \n\nUnfortunately, many are fresh from the shelter and we don't know much about them yet. \n\nLike us on Facebook - search Mutts & Meows - and help even more pets find loving homes.\n",

I love to run and play, and would love to be part of an active family!\n\nI'm already up to date on vaccinations, spayed, and I also have a microchip!

            "description": "Hi! My name is Danica Patrick like the female NASCAR driver. I suffered a catastrophic injury to my back legs on December 10, 2019, when I was hit by a truck on 40 Highway.  Luckily for me, good samaritans pulled me from the highway and brought me to the vet clinic, that was conveniently across the street, where it was determined I suffered a break to my spine. The clinic tried to find out where I came from and if anyone was missing me, but no such luck. The Doctor and Technicians here take REALLY good care of me. They are letting me heal and getting me fitted for a wheelchair.  I am doing awesome in the borrowed wheelchair. True to my name I like to go FAST!! I am still young and full of spunk. I like to be very vocal especially when I know I am about to get fed or go in my wheelchair. I do get along great with other dogs. I have mastered how to drag myself around when I am not in a wheelchair. I am considered special needs, so I know I am not for everyone, but if you are the right person to adopt me I will fill your heart with lots of love!",

He roamed a neighborhood for quite a while like that because no one could catch him. Some people in the neighborhood finally called us about him. A few of our amazing volunteers went into action and finally caught him, removed the jug, and took him to the shelter. He was so scared when he arrived that he wouldn't even make eye contact with anyone, and it was virtually impossible to put a leash on him.\n\nVolunteers have spent a lot of time with him to help with his socialization, and he is definitely more at ease around people he knows. He is currently undergoing leash training with volunteers. \n\nJughead loves other dogs and children.  He is really a sweet and very handsome boy, and we are thrilled with the progress he is making. We're sure he'll get the hang of the leash soon! Jughead's date of birth is 3/2/2019 and he weighs about 72 pounds.\n\nWe had a DNA test done on Jughead and we found out he is 50% Great Pyrenees, 25% American Staffordshire Terrier, 12.5% Akita, and 12.5% Sporting/Guard Dog Breed Groups.\n\nYou can submit an adoption application for this sweet boy at http://www.fayettefcar.com/applicationform, where you can also review FCAR\u2019s adoption requirements.\n\nAll FCAR adoptable dogs have been spayed or neutered, are current on all vaccines, on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, microchipped, and come with a 30-day pet health guarantee. The adoption fee is $95 with an approved application. A fenced yard is required for Jughead.\n",

She arrived at the vet clinic and all it took was a a couple of days and the wonderful staff showing her so much love and giving her a warm medicated bath to bring her out of her shell. She is incredibly sweet and and she is eating great! She will receive all of her needed vetting then she will need a foster home to relax in so we can get to know her better and help her find her perfect home. 1/31: Susie has started on her pre-treatment medications and will be moving to her Minnesota foster home very soon!3/2: Susie arrived at her Minnesota foster home a couple of weeks ago and has gotten pretty comfy. It did take her a little bit to adjust to the much colder temperatures and all of the snow on the ground but she has finally decided that it's not so bad. Susie is getting the royal treatment in her foster home including getting a pawdicure and getting medicated baths for her dry/itchy skin, which she has really started to love. She will be seeing the vet on Friday to ensure that she is healthy enough to start heartworm treatment as she was pretty thin when she joined us. Her foster mom & dad have been working with her on crate training and she is doing great!! She also has a new best friend in her foster furbrother Sarge.4/4 UPDATE: Susie is undergoing heartworm treatment and is doing great! She is on her second round of treatment and after a few weeks of crate and couch rest she will be all ready to be spayed and have some needed dental work.6/9/20: Susie is about 8 weeks post heartworm treatment and we will be getting her retested very soon to see if she can be cleared for spay and dental surgery. 8/17/20: We are getting closer to the big day to retest Susie after her heartworm treatment. She is doing well in her foster home and will be ready for adoption very soon!!11/22/20: Susie had her heartworm recheck and she was cleared for surgery! She will be spayed and get her needed dental work done on December 8th.",

I have been treated for heartworm disease and now I just have to wait to be retested in 6 months but I feel great! I like to have all your attention!

Please email adoptions@pawstinleypark.org if you are interested in adopting Holly, please fill out an application on our website.\n\n\nHolly is a 2-1/2-year-old mixed breed (our best guess is Shar Pei/Shepherd) looking for her true love!  Holly came to us over 10 months ago with her 4 beautiful puppies.  She has been very scared and doesn\u2019t seem to be used to people very much.  With lots of time and patience, Holly has learned to trust our volunteers and will stick by your side when she is comfortable with you.  This mama dog has the saddest eyes and we know she just wants to be loved.  Holly is looking for a quiet and patient home that will help her become the confident dog we know she can be!\nToys make Holly very happy, she can never have enough of them!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this pet, please visit our website to check on their current availability: http://www.pawstinleypark.org.. Adoptions are limited to 50 miles from the shelter. We do not ship animals. Adoption fees for dogs are $125-$275 based on age. While we do our best, we cannot make guarantees on breed, exact age and house training of our dogs.

            "description": "\"BE SURE TO WATCH MY VIDEO!\" \n\nDate of birth:  11/2017\n\n12/13/2020: Abe is a friendly and playful Lab mix!  He\u2019s acts like a big puppy.   He is a fun-lovin', treat-catchin' bundle of energy! Abe would literally jump for joy to have his own human playmate tossing him toys or treats in the back yard, or popcorn in the living room. And he'd be happy to work on some treat motivated training with his new person. We think Abe would love agility training and be great at it.  He\u2019s also a big fan of plush toys, chew toys and nylabones.  \n\n\u2022\u00a0Abe is quite vocal and would not be suited for apartment/townhouse living.  \n\n\u2022 Because of his high activity level, he'd really do best with a fenced yard.  He needs an active person to keep him busy and take him for long walks or runs.\n\n\u2022 He's very bright and a fast learner! He know basic obedience and would love to learn more.\n\n\u2022 Once you wear him out, he's loving and he likes to cuddle!\n\n\u2022 Abe needs a home without young kids. He's got too much energy and not enough manners or regard for personal space right now! He'd be fine with teenagers who are used to an active and very physical dog, and enjoy that type of play.  With more training and lots of exercise in his new home, he'd probably be fine with young kids eventually. \n\n\u2022 Abe is a bit choosy with his dog friends.  He likes some dogs and has played out in the yard with dogs, but we've had problems with it escalating into a fight.  We think it may be best for Abe to not live with other dogs.\n\n\u2022 Abe is 3 years old and weighs 65 lbs. He has a beautiful B&W coat. When he came to us he was a stray and he had a broken foot that had healed on its own, but crookedly. But it doesn\u2019t slow him down one bit!  \n\n\u2022 Abe has been neutered, vaccinated, microchipped and tested for heart worms. He's a sweetie and a lot of fun!\n\nMORE ON ADOPTING OUR DOGS... \n\n> COVID-19 UPDATE: PLEASE SUBMIT AN ONLINE ADOPTION APPLICATION AND A MEMBER OF OUR ADOPTIONS TEAM WILL REACH OUT TO YOU. Please visit our web site at HSGKC.ORG for an adoption application, our current COVID-19 adoption protocol, and other adoption info.  \n\n> If you decide you'd like to adopt one of the pets you meet, we reserve the pet for you but we generally don't send the pet home with you that day. We\u2019ll instead schedule a pick up date and time that\u2019s convenient for you.\u00a0  \n\n> Our goal is to send you home with a healthy pet and any information and support you may need to help your new pet adjust to his or her new home.  All of our dogs & puppies have been spayed or neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, treated for fleas & ticks, tested for heartworms (7 mo. and over), and are on monthly heartworm preventative. Puppies who are too young to receive all the necessary puppy boosters and/or first rabies shot may be brought back to us for those vaccines at no extra charge. You will also receive a leash, collar, coupons for pet supplies and services, toys, and educational materials. And we'll give your dog a bath before he or she goes home! \n\n> Please note that we prefer and may require a fenced yard for many of our dogs.  Exceptions are made on an individual basis depending on the dog's needs, the person's dog experience, the dog's and person's activity levels, home environment and other factors. \n\nThank you for searching for a shelter pet!\n\nDog Adoption Contact Info:\nEmail: christine@hsgkc.org\nPhone: 913.596.1000 ext. 113\nhttp://hsgkc.org",

            "description": "Greta is a 1.5 year old pittie mix. She was found as a stray on the side of the road, at night, sick with parvo. She beat it, though - she is one strong little girl! \n\nGreta is VERY shy around new people, especially men. But once she warms up to you, then you are friends for good! Greta LOVES playing with the other dogs in her foster home. She can play hard, but settle down and cuddle, too. She is looking for a home that understands she is shy in the beginning. Another dog really helps bring her out of her shell. Therefore, a home with another dog and a fenced yard to play in is a must to make her feel right at home!\n\nA fenced yard, another playful dog, and a female adult human in the home are all required for Greta's forever home. She has been adopted and returned once due to her extreme fear of men. She has been in an experienced foster home for over eight months now. She still runs from her foster dad sometimes. Greta needs an experienced owner with time and patience to continue working on building her confidence. \n\nIf you have questions or would like to speak with Greta's foster mom, please email your contact info to cohkcvolunteer@gmail.com and she will give you a call. Thanks!\n\n$200 Adoption fee includes spay, dewormer, vaccinations, rabies tag, microchip, heartworm test and heartworm/flea/tick prevention.\n\nFill out an application at www.chainofhopekc.org/adopt\n\n**Local Adoptions Only- Kansas City**\n**Currently in Foster Home**",

            "description": "\u2018CLASSIC CARTOON\u2019 THEMED MOMMA:  6 years old / 49 lbs.  \n\nHi, I\u2019m Betty Boop! I came to Mostly Mutts very pregnant & heartworm positive, so I\u2019m super grateful to have been rescued. My puppies have found their furever homes, & now it\u2019s my turn to find my home & live the good life!  I\u2019ve completed my heartworm treatment and am healthy now!\n\n\u2022 OTHER DOGS/CATS/KIDS: I\u2019ve liked most of the dogs that I met at Mostly Mutts & in my foster homes.  So, if you have a dog, let\u2019s meet & see if we\u2019ll be good play pals as I do enjoy playing with other dogs and I sleep with another dog in a comfy dog bed in my foster home. Sometimes I\u2019m nervous around dogs at first, so a proper outdoor introduction is key / No kitty cats, I chased the kitty in my foster home in a playful way, but I\u2019m just too much dog for a cat / I met a nice 10-year-old boy & a girl slightly younger at Mostly Mutts & did well with them, so calm kids around age 10 (or slightly younger) in my new home could be fun, let\u2019s meet!  I also lived with a 10 yr. old boy who became my best friend. \n\n\u2022 PERSONALITY/ENERGY LEVEL: I\u2019m a sweet, cuddly, playful, active & very friendly tail wagger who will give my paws to my people & do a happy little dance with them \u2013 so cute! I want to be with my people a lot & wouldn\u2019t do well if you were gone all day for work. So, I will be happiest in a home with a stay/work from home family member who wants to spend lots of time with their dog. I do have some anxiety & bark if left too much, so an apartment is not a good fit for me (I\u2019m on some meds for anxiety, see below). However, I am dealing better with this, but just give me some time to adjust to a new home. Also, a home with a secure, tall fence would be best for me so that I have plenty of running space to work off some energy / My energy level is 5-7+ & I like playing with my people.\n\n\u2022 SKILLS/CRATE/POTTY: I\u2019m very smart & a proud graduate of the Mostly Mutts University training program. I\u2019ve mastered the \u2018sit\u2019, \u2018stay\u2019, \u2018down\u2019, \u2018come\u2019, \u2018drop it\u2019, \u2018leave it\u2019 & \u2018place\u2019 commands.  I also use proper door etiquette & have good leash manners as well as accept nice strangers without jumping. I have issues with people that enter my home so I need to meet new people outdoors for the greatest success. I also have issues with people that are dressed in all dark color clothing. They scare me & this makes me want to protect my people. My foster family is teaching me that I\u2019m ok when seeing people in dark clothing. You will need to continue to watch this with me. I ride well in the car so you can take me places with you! / I do not like being in my crate & have barked for long periods of time when in a crate or behind a gate in my temp foster home, as I really just like being with my people. In my current foster home, I am doing very well sleeping at night on a large comfy dog bed in their bedroom / I\u2019m doing great with my potty manners on a good schedule & even use the doggy door to go outside when I need to potty!\n\n\u2022 LIKES/DISLIKES:  I love squeaky toys, balls, stuffed toys, Nyla bones & antlers. I love my daily walks & am a fantastic jogging and hiking buddy.  My favorite place to hang out is with my people, & I love all the cuddles that come my way / I don\u2019t like being in water, & people dressed in dark clothing make me very nervous. In my former home, I bit a person\u2019s ankle who was dressed in dark clothing. I also don\u2019t like being restrained by the vet & I would not be happy if I didn\u2019t get the attention & love on which I thrive. \n\n\u2022 MEDICAL:  I am on some anxiety medications & may be able to be weaned off those once that I\u2019m settled into my new home.  Time will tell. I\u2019m current on vaccinations, micro-chipped & spayed.  \n\nI\u2019m looking for a family to make me a cherished family member!  My adoption fee is $299.00, & I\u2019m in Kennesaw, Ga.",

            "description": "Moose is a typical large 1-1/2 year old puppy with lots of energy. He will be available for adoption after January 15, 2021 after he completes a two week training program. He loves everyone he meets and is walking well on a leash. He is house trained to potty outside and is crate trained. He loves belly rubs, toys and flopping on your lap if you let him. Most of all Moose would like to be the ONLY dog so he can hog all that attention for himself. A fenced yard to play ball in would be great. Loves toys and does get overly excited when meeting other dogs. He is extremely interested in chasing the cat, so we don't recommend cats. Since he is a large puppy with a lot of energy, we do not recommend small children. Moose's adoption fee is $200 and you can fill out our non-binding application form at www.apsofpc.org under forms \"Adoption\" 1/29/21 3:43 PM",

I love kisses, playing tug of war, snuggling, and taking long naps in my humans lap (although i'll nap in my crate if a human lap isn't available).   \n\nI also love playing with toys, any toys, all toys, yay toys!  My  favorite thing in the whole world is car rides, though!  It doesn't matter where we're going, as long as I can ride in the car with you!   \n\nI am crate trained and house trained! I'd do best without small children because I have a big puppy personality so I'm  still learning to keep all 4 paws on the ground when I get too excited. Even though I am a very hyper puppy, that also means I am a great running buddy! \n\nI need a little help with leash manners, but trust me I'll run with you as long as you want if you'll have some patience!! I've been in rescue since I was a little puppy. \n\nI was found in the middle of the street with my brother, and I was so sick and unhealthy that I had almost no hair! I grew up with a lot of anxiety because of this but in my 3 years in rescue I've gotten a lot of training to help with my anxiety.\n\n I would be best in a single dog home, but I promise to do my ABSOLUTE BEST to be on my best behavior if you have some patience and love for me!  I can't wait to meet my forever family, who I will love more than ANYTHING!!\n\nPlease give me a chance to show you that I can be the best companion ever! Will you give me a shot?? \n\nIf you are interested, please call or text my Aunt Cindy at 713 306-8045 or email her at cfitzger2019@yahoo.com. My adoption fee include all my shots, spay, microchip and transport. My adoption fee is $450\n\nThank you for listening to my story!\n",

We don't know much about her past, but it was obvious it was not a good one. She appeared to be healthy aside from some skin issues (Demodex). Ceely passed temperament testing, but the shelter staff said she appeared to be a bit fearful of men, was more confident outside, and was more shy indoors. She spent over a month at Animal Control before she got her freedom ride on December 12, 2019.\n\nABOUT CEELY\n\nCeely is now enjoying that foster life and on the hunt for her forever family. She is fully vetted, crate-trained and housebroken. She loves being outside, going for walks, playing in the creek, and chasing balls. She also loves cuddling on the sofa with her doggie friends or in the recliner with her foster mom. She currently has two doggie foster-siblings (a male and a female) and she has the most adorable play-bows and hops when playing with them in the yard. She's even good with the horses on the property! Ceely is still a bit nervous around strangers and tends to bark when she's afraid. Her foster family is working on this and she is showing lots of improvement. With slow, proper introductions, Ceely warms up to people and will lick their hands. She takes treats gently, is extremely sweet, and loves a good belly rub. She is learning to enjoy being a much loved member of a family. It is apparent that humans were previously unkind to her, so Ceely is looking for a forever family that will give her the some time to adjust and continue learning that not all people are cruel. She is a wonderful girl who would do well in a home with another dog and even horses! She is probably not suited for a home with cats as she seems to be overly interested in her foster family's barn cats.\n\nPhoto Album of Ceely: https://www.facebook.com/pg/FriendsToTheForlornPitbullRescue/photos/?tab=album&album_id=2872985706092910\n\nOur adoption fee is $300. All dogs are current on vaccinations, spayed or neutered, micro-chipped, on heartworm prevention, and are fed top of the line grain-free food.www.savingpitbulls.org",

Yes, that's right! Cats! However, she does not do well with those of her own species.\n\nDon't let her slightly advanced age fool you. She's a playful gal looking to please her people. She is well-trained, intelligent, and likes to play fetch. Want to take her to the park? That's great because Ginger likes to go for rides. So take her to the park, a hike or a road trip and you'll never need another companion. Set up a time to me sweet, cuddly Ginger.\n\n**Please Note: This is a courtesy post for another rescue; different adoption fees/policy apply.\n\n>>>\n\nFor more information or to meet this pet, please complete an application or send email to info@underdogaz.com\n\nIf you're reading this via a pet-search site, please view this pet's page\n\nat www.UnderdogAZ.com/animals\n\nfor more photos and details.",

            "description": "Are you looking to have your dog skills and experience challenged? Do you have the patience of a saint? Then Mighty is ready to test you. Seriously, he\u2019s an 8.6 magnitude earthquake in a city without building codes. He is a rainstorm on a herd of Gremlins, after midnight\u2026 with a plate of food.  For example:\n\n1.\tSpeaking of rainstorms \u2013 he hates them. As well as fireworks. Just about any loud, new, or odd noise scares him. He is even afraid of his farts.\n2.\tHe has the leash manners like some of those shoppers on Black Friday. You know, where the store is giving away an item to the first 200 guests. He just gets so excited sometimes he feels the need to jump up and grab the leash and walk himself.\n3.\tMighty has an allergy or several. No chicken for sure and probably no other poultry. Grains make him itchy, and sometimes he gets pink.\n4.\tHe\u2019s one of those \u201cblocky headed\u201d dogs\u2026 pit balls, pot bois, pibbles, poblanos, whatever.\n5.\tHe\u2019s nervous with new people, and he warms up to women quicker than men. Do you know that site with all the dogs who love the UPS guy? Mighty will not likely be making an appearance on that site.\n\nHere are some things we also know about Mighty. He completely loves his people. Once you\u2019re in, you\u2019re in for life. He likes to make new people friends, too, and that takes some time and treats\u2026 and those are treats without caramel color, because you know, the allergies. He loves attention, training, and showing his set of learned skills. He likes drinking from the hose, being outside with his people, and helping with yard work. If you have sticks, he\u2019ll chew them. If you\u2019re pulling weeds, he\u2019ll shake them and spit them out\u2026mostly. \n\nWe\u2019ve loved this guy from the moment we saw him tied to a tree with a note stating, \u201cMy name is Mighty, \u2026just tell me it\u2019s OK Needs a good home and lots of love\u201d We\u2019ve come a long way from where he wouldn\u2019t go near the car, wouldn\u2019t go up or down the stairs, and only went outside to do his business. He now, cannot wait for the next car ride and uses the stairs like Rocky. (Except for the basement stairs, they\u2019re still scary.) We\u2019re not going to lie though; his forever home is one in a million. His new home will require experience, management, smarts, time and dedication. \n\nAs they say, nothing worthwhile comes easy and nothing that comes easy is worthwhile. Mighty is a sweet, playful, loving dog, and is very loyal in his devotion to his people.  He has quite a few quirks, but hey, who doesn\u2019t? He has a long life ahead of him, and deserves an active, loving home that will always tell him, it\u2019s OK. \n",

It turned out he had bladder stones which we did have operated on. Unfortunately, even after he recovered from his surgery he still did not like being picked up and would bite. We believe he probably remembered that it used to be painful so it was his automatic reflex. We did find a wonderful, good hearted confident woman who wanted to adopt him anyway. Unfortunately, after a full year and several incidents\u2026 he did come back to us.  He is quite the spunky boy and full of personality!  We would love to find him a forever home for his remaining years!",

            "description": "I'm Midnight. My previous owners used to breed me. Thankfully some nice people rescued me when my owners abandoned me in a closed up house with no food or water. I had been in that hot house far longer than I wish to talk about. When they came to get me I was so scared. It took the nice lady trying to help me two whole hot dogs and a bottle of water to gain my trust. Now I smile and show my pretty teeth at her when I see her. I am still fearful of new people. It takes me just a bit to warm up to them. Once I do, I'm a lover. Some neighbors told my rescuers that I used to have human brothers and sisters living with me and that I like them. I've been around a pretty rowdy three year old human boy for a bit. He's my friend. I'm not sure how I'd be around cats as I haven't been around any. I like other dogs but they need to be smaller than me. I'd really like to find my forever home. Can you help me with that?",

A 3-year-old American Eskimo that weighs about 28 pounds, she is very timid and prefers to watch, although she will come over to take a treat or lick your fingers. She also came from the puppy mills of Ohio.\nShe is house-trained and crate-trained, but needs time and patience for other lessons. \nHayley loves her sister and the two of them are quite the pair as they run around the yard playing chase.\nHayley also likes chewing on buffalo horns, toys of all kinds, her blankets and beds (but she also likes to eat them, so caution is needed). She feels safest in her crate but will come out as confidence grows.\nShe needs a quiet home with very understanding and calm people that will respect her space and work with her on her trusting curve.\nShe needs a home with a fenced yard, that is MANDATORY.  Also she would not due will with active children, that would scare her.\n\nSHE GETS CAR SICK AND IS A FLIGHT RISK....so adoptions have to be within 2 to 3 hours of Cincinnati for her safety.",

She is a little shy at times, and we think she'd do best as an only dog, but she can do okay with other dogs after proper introductions.  She walks well on a leash and has received some professional training to help her acclimate to new situations.\n\nOur Josie is searching for a foster or forever home and we are diligently trying to help her find one!! She is housebroken, crate trained, spayed, fully vaccinated & microchipped.  She is currently being fostered in GA, but can also be available for adoption in the northeast.\n\nFor more information about Josie, please email us at info@barkvilledogrescue.org. If you would like to adopt sweet Josie, please submit an adoption application for her at http://www.barkvilledogrescue.org/adoption-application",

            "description": "Bella is a beautiful 3-year old female Pit Bull Terrier mix who was surrendered by her owner on February 7, 2019.\n\nBella has a white short smooth coat with patches of black on her right side and hind quarters, a long tail, and an adorable face with a black button nose, short semi-erect ears, and expressive eyes that beg for attention. \n\nThis little sweetheart has an affectionate personality. When Bella first came to our shelter (nearly a year ago now), she was rather reserved and took awhile to warm up to new people.  These days Bella is wiggling all over at the front of her kennel in anticipation of attention or a w-a-l-k :)  Her current kennel is one of our more open access ones with chain-link fencing on both sides so that she can interact with her neighbors (usually younger dogs and puppies), and Bella is very nice to them.\n\nHer previous owner told us that Bella has been kept indoors and is housebroken. She knows several basic commands (sit, stay, shake, and roll over).  Bella has no known behavioral issues.\n\nBella has an allergy to fleas and must be kept on a good-quality flea treatment to keep her comfortable and also to prevent hair loss.  \n\nBella weighed 46.2 lbs on intake in February 2019 and was already spayed.  She appears to have gained a few pounds since then thanks to the gourmet meals our kennel techs serve up each day :)\n\nBella spent approximately two months in a foster home this past summer.  She was returned in mid-September 2019 because her foster family moved and there was an unfortunate incident with a door being chewed .. Bella prefers to take the 'Fifth Amendment' and doesn't really want to elaborate about the details :( \n\nThese updated photos of Bella were taken on the afternoon of December 24, 2019 as she enjoyed a nice walk in the sunshine with one of our volunteers.  Bella is even more beautiful these days and looked especially festive in her bright red jester's collar.\n\n",

            "description": "My name is Bocce (pronounced Botchy \u2013 yes, I just had to be different).  I am an approximately 6 years old extremely handsome Gordon Setter mix.  You can see my photos and if I have to say so myself, they just don\u2019t do me justice.  To get the basics out of the way \u2013 I am neutered and up to date on my vaccinations.  I\u2019ve lived in a kennel situation for quite awhile, so my house training might need a little work.  I\u2019m a good sized boy \u2013 I weigh about 70 pounds.  \n\nSo, first - I don't do well with cats.  I have a super high prey drive and would be best as the only dog - at least to begin with.  \n\nI am being fostered by Companion Golden Retriever rescue in Utah.  Not sure why I\u2019ve been here this long.  You don\u2019t see many of me in rescue in this part of the country \u2013 so, come on people.  \n\nUnfortunately, I found myself in rescue when I got a little possessive of the lady of the house and tangled a little with the resident dog.  So, instead of working through it, they decided I was not the dog for them.  Their loss because I am the total favorite of some of the volunteers and they are super surprised that I am still not adopted (me too!).  They wonder if it\u2019s because when I first meet people, well\u2026  I get a little excited (ok, a lot excited)!  But, come\u2019on \u2013 setter people KNOW us setters \u2013 we\u2019re an exuberant breed.  \n\nI\u2019ve been through the Canine Good Citizen (CGC) class a couple times.  I still haven\u2019t passed \u2013 so, I get a little distracted (I heard rumors of being accused of being the class clown \u2013 I don\u2019t see the problem, do you?).  That is really just a part of my charming personality.  By the way, try having these classes outside where BIRDS fly over?  Uh \u2013 setter!!!  \n\nI like routine and structure and would do very well with someone that will set boundaries for me.  I\u2019m living in the rescue\u2019s kennel facility and while I get to get out and play a lot and spend time with the rescue\u2019s trainer, I do need more socialization that I can get here.  If you adopt me and work with me, I will be such a wonderful friend and companion.  I do walk quite well on the leash, but I can be easily distracted \u2013 uh, yoohoo \u2013  setter, birdy guy!  But, just think of the compliments you\u2019ll get as you walk or run with me.  \n\nI love these people, but I would really like my own home and frankly \u2013 it\u2019s way past time.  I would do best in a home probably without kids as I\u2019m a big boy and my exuberance could easily knock little kids over - then they cry and it\u2019s just a big mess.  Let\u2019s avoid that.  I do need a secure yard and preferably someone that understands my breed and my needs; and, I should probably either be an only dog, or live with a pretty laid back or more submissive dog as I can be pretty possessive of my toys and food.  People call because I\u2019m so handsome, but it\u2019s not always a match.   \n\nSo, if you think you would be interested in adopting me, you can email Deb at utgoldentails.@cs.com, Companion Golden Retriever Rescue in West Jordan, Utah; or, contact Kelley at 208-869-4065 or email at k40moore@cableone.net.  You won\u2019t be sorry!\n",

Often these surgeries fail and the dog is no further ahead for the effort.  Time will tell.  She is a charmer who loves to give kisses and get belly rubs in exchange.,  Sasha loves to play with other respectful dogs.  She enjoys walks and hanging with her person.  Sasha has amazing manners and is very smart.  She will charm you and be your best dogs ever!\n\nSasha is fully vetted.  She has been spayed, had a recent dental, vaccinated and microchipped.  If you would like to meet Sasha please contact us for an adoption application.  We require an approved application before we can schedule a home visit and a meet and greet .

Please EMAIL apassionforpaws@gmail.com and wait for confirmation of your appointment before coming to visit the Akita Ranch. We also request that visitors wear masks. This gorgeous brindle boy is Oso (Porter). He was hit by a car and had a right humeral fracture and bilateral elbow dysplasia. After several weeks of trying to help him recover, the veterinarian advised that his leg be amputated to avoid further complications and stop Oso from hurting. After Oso's surgery he has adjusted very well and actually seems happier than before since he is no longer struggling with pain!! He is now with us at the Akita Ranch and has quickly become a staff favorite!! He is friendly and bubbly as can be... LOVES affection, to play with you, splashing in his pool, going for walks, and smiling at all times. Even though he only has 3 legs he is just as physically capable as any of our Akita's. Once you meet Oso (Porter) you will never be the same!! Email: apassionforpaws@gmail.com for adoption information Visit Akita Ranch 28930 Ellis Ave, Romoland, CA, Open 10-5 daily BY APPOINTMENT ONLY.

She gave birth to a beautiful litter and was a great mom. Her pups have all been adopted and it is now her turn to find her forever home. Sadie is believed to be a mix of boxer and possibly pittie. She is now spayed, up to date rabies and distemper vaccines, tested for heartworm negative and now current on preventatives. She is also microchipped. Sadie is a sweet girl with lots of personality. She can play a little rough so no small children. She would need to meet any potential doggy siblings and would do best with another male dog. Kitties are not her favorite thing as she is overly interested in them. If interested in possible adoption please go to www.DelawareRescue.com and complete the online adoption application\n\nIf you are interested in adopting please read the information here and then complete our online adoption application. One of our volunteers will contact you once the application has been processed. If this animal is listed as a courtesy posting for another rescue please go to their website to complete the online adoption application.",

Johnny is great with people and adores snuggling, He would do well in a home with older children, because of his size he could knock down smaller kids. Johnny was hit by a car at some point and left to heal. Because of this he has a leg that was fractured and both his hips are not great (his leg is a bit wobbly and odd looking). You would not be able to tell as he is extremely well managed on pain control. A refresher in housebreaking may be needed for him. Johnny needs a family that will be able to support him as he gets older and using hip lifters may be in his future, and at 140+ pounds that is something to consider. He is vert playful (loves playing fetch) and is mostly good on leash but he is a very strong boy and may pull (could use a bit of a leash manners refresher). This beautiful soul wants nothing more than to have someone to curl up on the couch with and be loved for the rest of his life.",

My name is Charlie!! \n\nNot sure if you saw my story, but I was rescued by these nice people here from a shelter.  I was very emaciated ... but I am now happy and healthy and looking for my forever home where I can be spoiled and loved like I deserved my entire life... and looking forward to putting the past behind me.\nI am a 3 year old sweet boy that is looking for someone that will teach me that living in a house is pretty darn awesome!  Even though I was treated poorly in my past.. I hold no grudges.... I just love people!! and I just LOVE to play with my toys!! \n I would be best as an only pet, as I was not socialized with other animals much. \nI would love to go for walks or play in the yard with you... and then curl up on a nice comfy dog bed or maybe even next to you on the couch after! \nIf you think I could be the boy for you... please fill out an adoption application at:\n               www.dawghous.com\nThank you\nLove Charlie\n(video was taken beginning of November before I was all better... but shows how much I love my toys and what a fun boy I am!!! )\n",

            "description": "Meet Shelly\nShelly is a gorgeous girl who was dropped off at Animal Control. We pulled Shelly as soon as we learned she was going to be euthanized to make room for more dogs. Shelly arrived to the safety of our shelter on July 5, 2019. \nShelly will steal your heart. She has a beautiful face, gorgeous coloring and her eyes plead for your attention. Shelly is a 3.6 three-year-old Staffordshire/Bulldog mix. She is solidly built with a big gorgeous block head and she\u2019s sleekly muscled. She weighs 57 pounds. It looks as if Shelly has been bred for her puppies and then tossed aside when she was no longer useful. Her face is also covered in scars, which us makes us think that even worse things happened to Shelly in her previous life. But Shelly doesn\u2019t wear the trauma of her former life on her sleeve -- no way! This girl is nothing but kind and gentle to everyone she meets, people and kids, alike. To see her take treats will break your heart. She\u2019s soooo gentle and calm. She lives for attention. However, maybe given how she was treated early on and the situation she came from, Shelly has shown that she doesn\u2019t like other dogs or small animals. She will need to be the only pet in the family. \nShelly loves walking. She can be a strong walker, but will walk forever if given the chance. She will make for an excellent hiking or running companion. We think Shelly may be house-trained as she won\u2019t soil her kennel, but waits until she can get outside to do her business. She is very smart and it will be important to exercise her mind as well as her body. \nShelly has had a rough go in life, but she picks herself up and moves on. She has a solid temperament and puts herself out there to be loved and adored. If you\u2019re looking for a young dog with a calm and gentle demeanor and want to open your heart and home to the best doggie companion, come meet our Shelly.  We bet you\u2019ll fall in love with her as we have. \nShelly is spayed, microchipped and fully vetted.\nCall 706-865-4135 for information on additional health services provided as part of the adoption fee.  If interested in one of our puppies or dogs, please submit an application online or at the shelter. Applications can be submitted online at: https://www.charlessmithgallhumanesociety.org/page/dog-adoption-application \nOnce an application is submitted online, you will receive an email saying your application has been successfully submitted.  If you don\u2019t receive this email within 24 hours, please check to make sure all application fields were completed or please call our shelter at 706-865-4135. All adopters must complete an approval process which involves a reference check with current/recent vet and a brief home visit if located in the immediate area. We do permit out of state adoptions. Adopters MUST come to the shelter to transport their new family member home. We do not ship nor do we transport them to their new homes. Adoption policies and application procedures are detailed at the shelter website: http://smithgallhumanesociety.org/ under tab All Adoptable Animals.\nCharles Smithgall Humane Society (CSHS) is a No kill shelter. Animals in our care remain safe with us until adopted. Resident animals are primarily owner relinquished and also accepted from local Animal Control. The facility usually is operating at capacity with a list of animals waiting for space to open.\nAdoption hours are Thurs and Fri 1-4 p.m., Sat 10 a.m.-4 p.m. and Sun 1-4 p.m. Closed Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays \nLocation: 4823 Helen Hwy. 75N, Sautee, GA 30571, Phone: 706-865-4135\nEmail: smithgallhumanesociety@windstream.net\nOur shelter in Sautee GA is located about 3 miles south of the alpine town of Helen in northeast GA.\n",

If they will be left unattended in a yard for a significant amount of time, they will require a securely fenced area as they can be escape artists if left alone too long.\n\n\nFor more information or if you are able to give them a new home, please complete an adoption application (found at tikihutakitarescue.com/adopting) and email your application to Yankee and Dodger\u2019s owner at jdboys16@gmail.com\n\n\n\n\n(This listing is to help assist direct placements of rescues that are currently with other rescue groups, shelters or their current owners.

So don't let the serious face he puts on for the camera fool you, this boy is all body wiggles and tail wags! Henry loves to play with other dogs, male or female! He enjoys treats of all kinds, walks well on a leash and loves to go for car rides. Henry is ready for a family to love him and give him ALL the belly rubs!! \n\nAdoption fee: $150; includes spay or neuter, vaccinations (dhlpp and rabies), deworming for intestinal parasites and flea treatment. \n\nRescue inquiries can be sent to Friendsofbcacga@gmail.com or you can call the shelter directly at 478-445-5514 and leave a voicemail for a call back from the Rescue and Adoption Coordinator.\n\nThe Baldwin County Animal Shelter is often operating at capacity, this means that for every dog or cat that comes in, another must leave via rescue or adoption, or risk being euthanized for space.  Multiple dogs and cats come to the shelter EVERY DAY, which means animals must also be moving out at the same rate. Unfortunately, sometimes there are larger adult, \"pitbull\" or mix-breed dogs that are continually overlooked for their younger or more \"adoptable\" counterparts. Please consider adopting a new best friend today! \n",

He has lived with children and did well but would be better suited for older children simply because he can become excited and could be too much for a small child. Harveys two favorite activities are running and playing his Jollyball and de-stuffing toys. Harvey is very intelligent and quite the escape artist. Harvey can not have chain link fence. He will require privacy fence due to being able to climb chain link. An experienced owner would be best for Harvey due to his intelligence level and physical abilities. \n",

I was born around Jan 1, 2013, and I've been with a lady for several years, but the adoption didn't work out and now I'm back with my Streetdog friends looking for the perfect forever home for me. I'm a sweet girl, but I also like my personal space and would do well in a home where I am the only pet. I may not be that old yet, but I have some arthritis that sometimes acts up on me and give me an excuse to take extra naps ;) I'm an Australian Shepherd - Cattle Dog mix, full of so much love and companionship left to give. I love to meet new people, I have a favorite pillow and love soft plushy toys I can chew on. I like to spend time outside in the sunshine too. I've been spending some time in boarding, and I'm ready to find a home to do some serious couch surfing for sure! I'd love to meet all of you soon!",

He will repay his special person with much love and affection! He is very gentle and mellow, and walks beautifully on the leash. He enjoys chasing the ball in the playpen and shows a friendly interest in other dogs. He has a very dear temperament and is eager to please. He likes to roll on his back, and is a great company! OK with cats as he is currently being fostered with one. Please keep in mind that someone will need to be available during the day for his mid day feeding. Jasper weighs in at right about 50lbs.",

            "description": "Breed: Pit Bull Terrier\nGender: Female\nEstimated Date of Birth: March 15, 2016\nSize: 65 lbs\nLocation: Dallas, GA\n\nRESCUING LUX\n\nA lady was giving Lux, formerly known as Beauty, away outside of a Food Depot. One of our friends was able to convince the woman to give him the puppy in order to keep this sweet girl out of the wrong hands. He called us to ask for help and we just so happened to have a foster home opening for a puppy. Lux was adopted, but has recently come back to us and is search for a forever family where she can be the only pet.\n\nABOUT\nLUX\n\nLux, also known as Little Lux, is a smart and energetic little lady. She loves eating sticks and going for long walks. Her high energy is equally matched by her cuddling obsession. If she's not snuggling on you on the couch all day or deep underneath the sheets, she's in her favorite cave bed!\n\nLux LOVES new people, and I do mean LOVES new people - adults and children alike! She tries so hard to sit still, but her tail goes 100 mph and she can't decide whether to sit or get her favorite thing - BELLY RUBS! This girl will stop everything for a belly rub. She is working on being less excited when greeting new people, but is still a work in progress. She is very receptive to consistency with training corrections. Being amazingly smart and clever, no crumb will ever go unfound in your home. Lux is a great personal vacuum!\n\nLux is also emotionally sensitive. If you are sick or sad, she will nudge her way into your arm and lick you to make it all better. To be honest, she loves giving kisses! She is great on the leash as well. In particular, the pronged collar and the easy walk as well, but will require someone willing to keep working on commands. With simple corrections in the beginning of the walk, she falls into the routine of staying behind you and not pulling on the leash. She is very interested in wildlife roaming the neighborhoods and will furiously wag her tail to get their attention. That being said, you say \"keep walking\" and she obeys. She is crate-trained and housebroken.\n\nLux's ideal situation would be in a home as the only pet with a private backyard and a 6 foot fence. Little Lux's love knows no bounds. Her eyes will say it all - hook, line, and sinker! She is looking for snuggles, structure, and maybe a piece of ham (she can recognize the decibel level and smell of cheese/ham packing opening from 200 yards away)! This lady is a real gem and is ready to entertain and snuggle anyone that will have her.\n\nPhoto Album of Lux: https://www.facebook.com/pg/FriendsToTheForlornPitbullRescue/photos/?tab=album&album_id=2603076549750495\n\nOur adoption fee is $300. All dogs are current on vaccinations, spayed or neutered, micro-chipped, on heartworm prevention, and are fed top of the line grain-free food.",

Belle is a bouncy girl with a fun personality. Belle is excited when she first sees you and will dance around in anticipation of your affection. At heart she is a love bug though, and will lean into you for pets and belly rubs. Bell has done very well in a home environment, while crated during the day. Belle is treat motivated, and is taking well to learning her commands. She also enjoys playing fetch, and will bound after the ball in a happy prance. Belle is a dog that is going to shower you with a lot of love, and will be appreciative of the safe, happy home she is provided with. She will return any love and joy she receives into your life 10 fold. For a fulfilling, purposeful life; look no further than this sweet girl.\n\nApplication Process\n\nMAPS\u2019s adoption process is designed to help best place dogs with homes that are in the best interest of the dog and their human companions. The adoption process starts with a prescreen review of a Guardian Application. Making decisions about dog placement in adoptive homes is an \"art\", not a \"science\", and there will be times when applications will be denied for various reason(s). This is left to the discretion of the MAPS after reviewing relevant information. MAPS reserves the right to make all decisions regarding placement or final disposition of any rescued dog in its care into a foster or adoptive home. There is absolutely no guarantee, made or implied, that any person or persons requesting to adopt a dog being fostered through MAPS, or posted on MAP's web site, will be granted an adoption. After a successful prescreen, including background checks, the applicant(s) are notified that they can visit the dogs and a time slot is made for the dog and applicant interaction. After the interaction we encourage several days of reflection before adopting a pet to help assure this will be a lifetime commitment of love and quality care for the dog. Next we conduct a home/neighborhood visit to the Guardian Applicant's home. If the home visit proves successful the new mom and/or dad of the dog will sign an Adoption Agreement and share a lifetime of love and mindful growth !\n\nGuardianship Application available for download at\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/MAPSFiles\n\n\n\nMAPS Dog Rescue Mission\n\nMidwest Area Pit Stop, Inc. (MAPS) is a foster home based rescue located in Madison, Wisconsin established in 2005 after being part of the Chicago Illinois based rescue Furry Friends for several years. MAPS focuses on providing a structured, safe calm environment for the dogs in their care that helps them flourish. This structured home environment is complimented by exercise, Positive Reinforcement Deference Training, very high quality dog food in addition to a broad spectrum of proven food supplements including vitamins and supplements. In addition to fostering, MAPS provides sponsorship funds to help with the veterinary expenses and/or Breed DNA testing to save dogs in need of a rescue at the end of their options. MAPS has been active in the community promoting dog safety, how to build a healthy relationship with your dog, and fighting breed discrimination including breed testing of hundreds of dogs since December 2007. MAPS believes that dogs are a central component for people to have a more meaningful and purposeful life. That is, if people are willing to embrace mindfulness in daily living. Dogs help us connect to reality and make life worth living through example and deep bonds. MAPS is not about how many dogs are adopted in the shortest amount of time but rather measures to help insure the dogs that are adopted do not come back for the wrong reasons.",

She isn\u2019t a fan of other dogs or cats either, so Zoey would be best as an only dog and the center of attention! Zoey CAN NOT be adopted into a home with another dog or cat. She also NEEDS to go to a home with a yard, so no apartments or townhomes. What she\u2019s really looking for is a guy who will love her unconditionally and loves American bulldogs! Zoey even has a message for you: \u201cI\u2019ve been on all of these apps swiping to try to find Mr. Right...ah but alas no luck yet...I\u2019m still waiting and hoping that my knight in shining armor is out there!\u201d She has a shorter coat because of her American Bulldog mix. She loves to play and definitely loves her walks and runs, but she does enjoy her cuddle time. She weighs around 70 pounds and won\u2019t get any bigger because she\u2019s around four years old. She is completely vaccinated, spayed, and microchipped. Zoey came from rural South Texas around 2 years ago, so she is definitely ready for her new home!! Her adoption fee is $100. \n\nGo to our website https://redfernanimalrescue.org/ and fill out an application if you are interested! Due to the amount of inquiries we are receiving, we are prioritizing adoption applications at this time. Make sure you\u2019re filling out an adoption application on Red Fern Animal Rescue\u2019s site in Colorado, as we are not a shelter in Tennessee! Please give us 48-72 hours to respond to you!",

He just had his 3rd day of treatment and he is perking up quite a bit!  We are sure this is what caused his anemia. He was sleeping a lot but much more alert now! He loves to go outside!  We will get some pics of him walking around.  \n\nOnce he is better and blood work is improved, he will have a much needed dental.  Thank you for helping us save this little man! \n\n1/3/20 -   Tiny was going to be taken to a shelter by his owner when someone stepped in and picked him up and called us.  He was transported to Houston yesterday and saw our vet this morning.   \n\nSome of what he has that we know of are the following:\nskin infection,  cataracts and atrophy of the irises, luxating patellas, ear infection, ear mites,  small cyst on head, loose and terribly infected teeth  and he is underweight.  We will know more tomorrow when we get blood and urine results.",

Cytopoint has helped the itch, but his hair gets super oily only a few days after a bath. We are trying different shampoos to see what may work. \n\n1/27/20 - Well, this is one we in rescue have heard so many times. Girl gets yorkie and he is her baby, girl gets married years later and has human baby, and the four legged baby must go. :( \n\nUnfortunately for Harley, the date they chose to let him go was Thanksgiving. We have promised Harley that his next Thanksgiving will be full of love, belly rubs, kisses and treats with a family that will never give him up. \n\nHarley is a sweet boy and sleeps on a pillow next to his foster mom's head. He gets along well with the easy going pups in the house, cuddling with a couple of them from time to time. He tends to be a bit nervous around a lot of activity, so we are looking for a quiet household. \n\nHe is very good about going outside to go to the bathroom and comes right back inside. He goes to the door and looks at his foster mom to let him out. Keep in mind that sometimes they do have accidents and things can vary from home to home so don't expect perfection in the housebreaking department! \n\nHarley does have some skin issues due to allergies. This was reported to us when he was surrendered. He recently had some issues and responded well to Cytopoint. \n\nHis teeth were a mess when he came to us and a dental was done where he ended up losing 22 teeth. He recovered quickly and eats very well! He is on canned food with some water mixed in. \n\nHarley's blood work looked very good. He does not seem to have any issues other than allergies ... oh, and he does have luxating patellas which is common in yorkies. Best to keep him from jumping up and down on things. Harley walks up steps to his foster mom's furniture! \n\nThis is a charming little guy with a whole lot of love to share with someone. <3\n\n1/3/20 - BIO COMING SOON!",

            "description": "PLEASE READ CISCO'S FULL PROFILE BEFORE INQUIRING.  WE WILL NOT RESPOND TO APPLICANTS OR INQUIRIES THAT DO NOT READ HIS PROFILE. \n\nIF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR IMMEDIATE GRATIFICATION, CISCO IS NOT FOR YOU. \n\nCisco requires multiple meetings before going into a new home.  His foster mom MUST be able to show and observe the interactions with any potential foster or adopter to teach them how to manage his fears.  \n\n**************************************\nIf you're interested in adopting me after reading my full profile below, please go to the rescue website and submit the online adoption application by copying and pasting the link below into your web browser. \n\nhttp://lowermainlandhumanesociety.org/adoption-application/\n\nA adoption application and home visit is required.  We will not respond to inquiries sent through the Petfinder \"ASK ABOUT ME\" button. \n\nCisco was found abandoned and tied to a bus stop in Surrey.  He was picked up by animal control and ended up in the municipal shelter.  He did not do well there as his fear levels were so high.  He is about 6 years old, 10 lbs..\n\nHe was taken out of the shelter by another rescue society and placed in foster care for 3 weeks.  However he did not do well there, as the foster parent didn't understand that Cisco did not want to be forced to interact with humans.  He just wasn't ready for that yet. \n\nCisco was transferred to our rescue.  He was not forced to interact with us in any way for about 3 months.   We did not pet him, we did not pick him up, we just left him alone.  We were very patient and took things very slowly.  After a few months he would come up to us and we would give him just a little pet, a second or two, then worked his way up to longer pet sessions. \n\nFlooding Cisco in any way is a big trigger for his PTSD and he will warn and bite if he is forced to interact with you before he is ready.  We took our time and allowed him to come to us when he was ready which has worked wonderfully. \n\nAfter a year with us, Now he is so affectionate and loving.  He accepts pets from me, I can pick him up as well.  He still had a major issue with getting a flat collar or harness put on (total fear trigger).  Cutting his nails and cleaning his ears are extremely stressful for him and he needs to be muzzled and worked with calmly and slowly.\n\nCisco will give very clear signals that he has had enough and when he does, his human must respect that and leave him alone.  Of you ignore his clear signals, this could result in triggering Cisco's fear and he will go into protection mode.\n\nWhen he goes into a new home, his fear will return and his new human must understand that they cannot flood him or force him to interact.  Just like we did.  This will take months.  His new human must be patient, kind, and understanding.  \n\nYou must be able to fully read the body language of a dog if you would like to adopt Cisco..\n\nNo first time dog owners.  No children.  No future children.  No large dogs.  No homes with multiple dogs.  \n\nCisco will be your best loving friend forever.  But he will not trust any new person 100%\n\nCisco should not live with children they are too unpredictable.  He has been fine with cats and all the small dogs he has met and lived with. He is very fearful of large dogs. He is very scared of many dogs at one time and will bolt and scream in fear.  Dog parks are a HUGE NO for Cisco.\n\nHe is house trained and potties outside.  We have pee pads down in case we are out too long and he will use them if necessary. \nHe walks wonderfully on leash and should never be off leash and never taken to off leash dog parks.  All interactions must be in a controlled environment.  It only takes one thing to trigger his fear and he will bolt. \n\nCisco is not suitable for the first time or inexperienced dog owner.  He requires a human that has the knowledge of fearful dogs and their body language. Please do not apply or inquire if you are a first time dog owner or if you've only experienced working with easy dogs. \n\nHis adoption fee is $295. \nHe has been neutered, microchipped, vaccinated, and has had his dental, deworming and flea treatment. \nA home visit and adoption application is required.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Cisco, please go to our website and submit the online adoption application.  A home visit is also required. \n\nPlease copy and paste the following link into your web browser.\n\nhttp://lowermainlandhumanesociety.org/adoption-application/\n\n",

She has been living with our behaviorist and is learning to trust again after having an unfair start to her life. She is over a year now and is spayed  UTD on all vaccines. \nKate, who took the pictures started slow with Gia wearing her safety basket, and after around 10 minutes Gia knew she could trust her and the muzzle was removed. She was rubbing up on Kate and showing some love after that. What a remarkable dog that has been treated so unfairly in her past has learned to trust again.\n\nGia is looking for a special home that will show her endless love and give her the home that she deserves.

            "description": "Hi, my name is Ozzie and I've had a pretty rough life up until I became part of the SSRR family. The doctors think I was hit by a car and my owner waited about 6 weeks before surrendering me to the local shelter. The shelter really couldn't help me so it wasn't looking good and then the wonderful SSRR family decided to take me in and help me feel better.\n\nI had a dislocated hip and was going to require some major surgery. However, before the surgery could happen I had to get my skin infection cleared up and that took another 3 weeks. By the time I was able to have surgery I had almost learned to live with the pain and walk with my foot turned out. BUT, thanks to many people who loved me enough to donate toward my care I was able to have the hip surgery and go home to my foster.\n\nI'm doing great and resumed full doggie activity. The surgery made such a difference and it was so exciting when I finally got to play with my foster brothers and sisters. I have fit in well and become another member of the pack. They love me here and I love them too, but I would love to find my forever family!\n\nMy foster mom says I am SUPER sweet and I love lots of attention! I'm smart and learn quickly. I am housebroken and I know how to sit although I don't do it often (my therapist uses it to strengthen my leg so it's not fun anymore). I know to stay and I walk very well on a leash. There are no children in our house now, but I have been around them at the park and they do not bother me. I actually like all the pets and sweet things they say. I am completely food motivated, so if I need to learn something there is definitely a way to get me to do it!\n\nIf you are looking for a loving, sweet, loyal rotti to call your own I am your guy! Please ask my foster mom questions about me, she loves to talk about me!",

I am a handsome, 5 year old, 87lb., Pit mix. I have a lot of energy and need a privacy fenced in yard to train in! My favorite play on the field is cuddling. I am looking for a forever home without any other dogs.  I do not like to share that spotlight.  I am house and crate trained too! I can't wait to do the touchdown dance with you once you finalize my adoption! \n\n\nMy adoption fee is $150 and includes my spay/neuter, vaccinations, wellness exam, heartworm test, and microchip! If you're interested in meeting/adopting me, please visit www.rescueonespringfield.com/our-adoption-process/adoption-application/ and fill out the form! We do adopt out of state with vet references and video home check. *Adopter is responsible for coming to get the dog and returning the dog if the adoption does not work out* \n\nDon't forget to LIKE us on Facebook!-www.facebook.com/rescueonespringfield\n\n*Remember, dogs are pack animals. Because of this, Rescue One does not adopt to outdoor-only homes. Pets are family and are not disposable.  Please make sure that you are 100% committed to a pet before considering adding one to your home.",

Through a fence she is a guard dog but as soon as you open the gate she's like \"naw, I was just kidding ya'll\" She really is a love. Her favorite thing to do with volunteers is cuddling on the couch while watching Netflix on their phones. She likes dramas the best. Mimi lets you dress her up in clothes and take as many pictures as you want. She knows she is cute. If your looking for a supermodel dog go to www.libertyacresunited.com and submit an application.",

Riley is a sheltie and was born without a tail and had two holes where he would pass urine. When our volunteer went to pick him up at the puppy mill, he and his very under socialized siblings were hiding in the corner of a cardboard box. Since the other puppies looked normal, they were put up for sale and given to dealers to resell at pet stores or online. The puppy mill operator refused to give up any of the other puppies or Riley\u2019s mother. She had produced 12 litters of puppies in six years. He operates legally in Pennsylvania. \n\nDiagnostics showed that Riley was not just born without a tail, but he was also born with only one kidney. This is a genetic issue. Thanks to the very best care from Dr. Niles and nurse Tiara at Metropolitan Veterinary Associates, Riley had total urogenital reconstruction surgery, was treated for multiple urinary tract infections, has healed so well and since he is now UTI free for a few months is finally up for adoption! \n\nRiley is a typical sheltie. He likes to herd dogs and people, loves to play and is very smart. He can be a bit grabby and skittish due to his puppy mill background so an adult only home with a very secure fenced yard and another playful dog is best. Riley loves other dogs more than anything. \n\nRiley needs a very special and patient forever home. He has so much love to give and every day he blossoms into a more wonderful puppy. \n\nRiley is EXACTLY why puppy mill breeding for pet store sales is a problem and why we need Victoria\u2019s Law here in Pennsylvania. \n\nTo apply to adopt Riley, please go to www.findingshelter.org",

He is back in his foster home awaiting his forever home.________________________________Original PostingFrankton Tye whose call name is 'Tye' is a very handsome boy who recently arrived from Ireland. GFNJ is happy to welcome him to our family. He is very friendly, affection and just sweet. Tye is calm and quite an Irish gentleman. He walks very nicely on leash. Tye is a mid-sized boy. He is 3 years old. He is in a foster home with greyhounds and a small dog and doing very well with them. He is cat workable in that he does show interest in the resident cat and would do best without a cat. Due to the high travel and other costs involved in bringing Tye from Ireland to GFNJ, the adoption fee is $500.",

There are very few other dogs she gets on with. Midnight is very gentle to her humans and would be good as a family dog, seeing as she enjoys being loved on. We recommend no babies or children under 13.\n\nMidnight is a great hunter and would be great if you have any kind of rodent problem. She kills worf rats with ease.\n\nMidnight has a pretty, brindle coat and short hair, most of her body being black. She rarely jumps up and has deep brown eyes. She's a happy girl, her round eyes and a pink tongue being the \"cutest\" features about her. She's the type to cuddle up to you and let you play with her ears.",

For more information and the adoption application for Angel, please visit our website belowhttp://www.coastalgsr.org/dog_profile.php?ID=22042&name=AngelAngel's fantastic in the house, crate trained, gets along with other dogs, and needs someone with GSD experience who can give her structure and boundaries. She will repay you with more love than you thought imaginable! Angel's owners wanted to surrender her to their local shelter because she became infested with ticks. She didnt even have a name her owners just called her Dog. We were contacted by a concerned animal control officer and we invited Angel to join the Coastal family. Now that the ticks are history and she is safe with us, this beauty is doing very well in her foster home. Angel is a big (90 pounds), sweet girl whos quick to learn and eager to please, but she can be stubborn and will take charge if allowed so she needs a calm, assertive handler who can give her leadership and consistency. Shes become very good on a leash, has learned some basic commands (heel, halt, sit), and continues to improve her manners and obedience.Angel is almost perfect in every way, but she tends to pick her favorite person in the household and not bond with anyone else- she will also protect them from the other members of the household (including dogs), if allowed. She would do best in a low traffic home that has GSD experience and understands dogs who need a leader.The minimum adoption donation for adults is $375 and the adoption donation for puppies is $500. This amount only partially covers the cost of veterinary care, boarding fees, and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs and is tax deductible. The adoption donation provides that all dogs will be spayed or neutered, receive current vaccinations, and are microchipped. If not, arrangements will be made on an individual basis ( i.e., puppies who will need to be altered by 6 mos old). Special consideration may be given to those willing to adopt older dogs or dogs with physical problems.",

For more information and the adoption application for Maximus, please visit our website belowhttp://www.coastalgsr.org/dog_profile.php?ID=20566&name=MaximusMaximus is a total love bug with the volunteers he knows and trusts, but he's another of our long-timers. He's been with us since the beginning of 2013. Yes, 2013. When you rescue a dog from the shelter, you rarely know what you're going to get. Sometimes, they just need to get out of the shelter and decompress, which will allow them to relax and adjust to their new life. Sometimes they need more.This is Maximus. Yes, he's stunning and he's a big boy. No, we don't know what his life prior to rescue entailed, but we can only imagine. Maximus doesn't trust people he doesn't know. Potential adopters? They're all people he doesn't know. If you spend time around him, not even touching him, he'll notice you. He loves treats and tossing him treats is a sure way to get him to bookmark that face of yours. Some of our volunteers spent a week just giving him treats before moving on to walking him. Once he thinks of you as a treat dispenser, he's no longer too scared, because treats are kind of worth whatever bad things he imagines could happen. I mean, treats!Then, when you get him out, you'll notice he's cautious, but he loves going on walks so much that he's willing to put up with the geeky human at his side.We don't know what happened to him, but we're pretty sure it was nothing. A whole lot of nothing. No socialization, no attention, no training, no love, and no promise of a better day. After you've taken him on a few walks, you'll notice his demeanor change. He loves walks almost as much as treats. I mean, walks!Even though he loves walking with you, he won't be a cuddly, leaning against your side kind of guy just yet. Trust comes slowly. Take it slow and, after a while, you'll notice that he's seeking affection. Once he trusts you, well, there's no end to his adorableness and affection. He loves belly rubs, giving kisses, playing catch, completing an obedience command with flair and then looking at you for praise... he's the whole package. He's going to need an adopter who can go slowly with him. Someone who is a strong handler and doesn't have a busy household. A local adopter who can come spend time getting to know him before adopting him. We wouldn't put Maximus in a home with young children, because that would be overwhelming for him. This stunner is looking for a person or a couple of people with whom he can build trust and a life.Could that be you?The minimum adoption donation for adults is $375 and the adoption donation for puppies is $500.

For more information and the adoption application for Missy, please visit our website belowhttp://www.coastalgsr.org/dog_profile.php?ID=20090&name=MissyThere is no line of people trying to adopt Missy. Who can say why, but it's shocking!Sure, shes a senior who is around 12 years old. Missy was adopted years ago, but, sadly, her adopter passed away and she's back with us. OK, shes on prescription food for some GI issues. It's true, she's more of a one person kind of dog who would rather share all of her time with you over being the life of some big social gathering. They're gross. You can catch COVID-19 at large social gatherings. She's trying to keep you healthy. Of course, she wants to be the only dog in the home. She doesn't like cats. Oh, and she's a senior with arthritis in her hips and takes Metacam for that. Yes, she's also now on medication for seizures, because she had a small one and we sent her to a neurologist who preformed a spinal tap (to rule out meningitis), thought her pituitary gland looked normal, ruled out Cushing's disease, imaged her four ways to Friday, ruled out any tumors in her brain, put her on Zonisamide (for epilepsy), and she hasn't had a seizure since. Talk about being vetted.Adopt a seizure free gal pal!Here's what you're missing: a dog who will be your ride of die. A GSD who is potty trained, crate trained, good in the house, wants to be with you at all times, but doesn't freak out if you leave the house because separation anxiety would make her appear needy and she doesn't even like saying that word. A dog who loves going on walks and doesn't need them kept short because you're judging her age. She can walk and walk and walk and still find time to chase squirrels. You'd be missing out on the best dog her foster has ever fostered (but can't adopt, because, when things go back to 'normal,' she'll be traveling half the month). Every day you don't adopt her is a day you won't know the love of a senior dog, which is the truest love on earth.

For more information and the adoption application for Diesel, please visit our website belowhttp://www.coastalgsr.org/dog_profile.php?ID=22188&name=DieselDiesel was lucky enough to score a great foster home and is loving life! Theyve crate trained him, which resulted in him being potty trained, hes been good in the house, and is enjoying all of the toys and balls theyve given to him. He loves to follow his foster dad everywhere he goes and can be protective of the home, but hes in good hands and is learning whats allowed and whats not OK. Diesel was a little scared when first rescued and can be anxious in some situations, but he's also quite the charmer and has done well meeting new people. Do you have a ball? Well then, he's also your best friend! This handsome boy is around 2 years old, knows his basic commands and is trying to implement them in daily living, and really (REALLY) loves balls. He will fetch them for hours and doesn't mind holding them for you (in his mouth, of course) while you take a phone call here or there. He takes treats gently and, even though he doesn't seem to have been highly socialized with dogs prior to his rescue, we're working with him on that and he's good about being around dogs while on a leash and likes to make out with some dogs through the fence. Diesel is in great shape and can jump chest high from a stand. He had jumped a 4 baby gate in his foster home, but his fosters are working with him on boundaries. He is going to need a secure yard as we have no doubt he could jump a 5 wall or fence.The minimum adoption donation for adults is $375 and the adoption donation for puppies is $500. This amount only partially covers the cost of veterinary care, boarding fees, and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs and is tax deductible. The adoption donation provides that all dogs will be spayed or neutered, receive current vaccinations, and are microchipped. If not, arrangements will be made on an individual basis ( i.e., puppies who will need to be altered by 6 mos old). Special consideration may be given to those willing to adopt older dogs or dogs with physical problems.",

We threw him a lifeline and he's been in a foster home ever since! This sweet boy loves people and gets along with other dogs, even the small ones. He warms up quickly to people, yet, sort of prefers to do his own thing. Winston reacts to other dogs he sees while on his leash but it is more out of excitement than aggression. He has a torn acl and we have him on Rimadyl to keep him comfortable.Winston would much prefer a home with older kids or adults only as he enjoys a calm lifestyle. While Winston is good with small dogs, we are unsure of cats, especially because one of his favorite pastimes is to chase squirrels!If you're looking for a loyal companion who has lots of life left and even more love to give, Winston is the boy for you.

            "description": "Khaleesi IS AVAILALBE (updated 02-02-2021).To meet any of our dogs you must first complete our online adoption application on our website. For more information and the adoption application for Khaleesi, please visit our website belowhttp://www.coastalgsr.org/dog_profile.php?ID=21789&name=KhaleesiMost of us fumble and stumble our way through life forever wondering what our true purpose might be. Not Khaleesi. She knows with 100 percent certainty, just as sure as she knows that car rides are fun and grass is tasty, that she was put on this earth to be part of a family. What she doesnt know is why its taking so gosh-darn long! Now almost 7 years old, Khaleesi has been dealt some truly lousy hands by fate. She was raised in a loving home early on, but got rehomed because one of the old dogs in the house didn't get along with her. We don't know anything about that home, but Khaleesi ended up in a high kill shelter overweight and unable to walk. Her chip was still registered to her original owners who were contacted but they were not in a position to take her back and her current owners made it clear they didn't want her. Even though we didn't need another medical dog, Coastal couldnt stand by and let her be abandoned/discarded yet again. So we agreed to take her into the rescue and assume her medical care and the journey began. Unfortunately, fate wasnt quite done messing with Khaleesi, and following an initial operation where pins and plates were put into her legs, she contracted MRSA, necessitating another surgery to remove the pins and plates. Complications ensued, as did more surgeries and treatments, casts, splints, enforced crate rest, foul-tasting medicines, and on and on. Two and a half years have passed since her ordeal started, enough time to crush just about anyones spirit, but, through it all, Khaleesi has been a real trouper. Now, thanks to the excellent care of her vets and foster mom, shes largely overcome her injuries (she still wears a splint and needs to be helped while walking), and is more than ready, willing, and able to finally achieve her lifes purpose of being a cherished member of a family. This beautiful girl has so much love to give, and shes sick and tired of holding it in, doggone it!Khaleesi adores people and bonds easily. Shes extremely observant and engaged, a quick study, food/treat motivated, good in the house, not destructive, has ears softer than mink, and sheds much less than your average GSD. Shes an outstanding watchdog and an effective deterrent against pesky uninvited solicitors, but can also be trained to 'not' bark at someone like your mailman, fairly quickly. She does tend to bark at other dogs she encounters on walks, but has made friends with the ones at her foster moms house with a proper introduction. Due to her prey drive she is probably not suitable for a home with cats, however.The past two years havent been much fun for Khaleesi enforced crate rest is boring and lonely and shes eager to make up for the time shes lost by living every day to the fullest. The simple things in life, things that other dogs take for granted, like a car ride or a walk in the park, give Khaleesi unbridled joy. Sometimes she can get a tad too overexuberant and boisterous, but this tendency will undoubtedly dissipate with time and training. Though a bit unpolished at present, Khaleesi really is a special girl who deserves a family worthy of her love and companionship, one that can help her blossom into the awesome dog she was meant to be. The minimum adoption donation for adults is $375 and the adoption donation for puppies is $500. This amount only partially covers the cost of veterinary care, boarding fees, and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs and is tax deductible. The adoption donation provides that all dogs will be spayed or neutered, receive current vaccinations, and are microchipped. If not, arrangements will be made on an individual basis ( i.e., puppies who will need to be altered by 6 mos old). Special consideration may be given to those willing to adopt older dogs or dogs with physical problems.",

Shell give you a reason to stop eating (she needs someone to throw her ball or point the hose so that she can eat the water stream) and an excuse to take a nice long walk (while keeping physical distance and, better still, toning up your whole body so that when you go back to work no one will believe you didnt have some work done while they were all eating fries and chocolate).Around 6 years old now, this gorgeous pup was found living in a rural field. She's since been obedience trained, adores water fights, can't think of anything better than a car ride, and enjoys her toys. She doesn't love going to the vet, will take over if not given proper structure and boundaries, but is affectionate, smart and learns quickly with a strong handler.Bailey has been through obedience training, knows all the tricks, walks well on a leash, and absolutely loves car rides. She responds fantastically to leadership and is going to make an awesome companion for someone with GSD experience.The minimum adoption donation for adults is $375 and the adoption donation for puppies is $500.

For more information and the adoption application for Poncho, please visit our website belowhttp://www.coastalgsr.org/dog_profile.php?ID=20996&name=PonchoIn the spring of 2014, a litter of newborns was found sleeping in a drain pipe. Thanks to a Good Samaritan, the mother and her puppies were saved, one of them being Poncho. If you are looking for a young, energetic, ball crazy, trained, Ridgeback-y looking big boy and have the time to show him structure, boundaries, and work on continuing his socialization, this boy will have you smiling from ear to ear for years to come.We've been working with this handsome purple tongued boy for over four years now. Poncho was terrified of everything he didn't know and he knew nothing except the home in which he was being forced to leave. He was petrified. He was unsure of himself, his surroundings, strangers, other dogs, and he was lashing out. He's come so far, but he still needs a low traffic household and someone who will continue to introduce him to the world around him. Poncho's now obedience trained, so much less fearful, so much more trusting, and so responsive with the people who have worked with him. He needs an adopter who can spend time with him, prior to adoption, as he doesn't trust strangers. We will work with you and Poncho- getting you both to the point where he trusts you and can leave with you. He just needs someone who can spend the time to show him structure, boundaries, and work on continuing his socialization, and this boy will have you smiling from ear to ear for years to come.The minimum adoption donation for adults is $375 and the adoption donation for puppies is $500. This amount only partially covers the cost of veterinary care, boarding fees, and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs and is tax deductible. The adoption donation provides that all dogs will be spayed or neutered, receive current vaccinations, and are microchipped. If not, arrangements will be made on an individual basis ( i.e., puppies who will need to be altered by 6 mos old). Special consideration may be given to those willing to adopt older dogs or dogs with physical problems.",

For more information and the adoption application for Brody, please visit our website belowhttp://www.coastalgsr.org/dog_profile.php?ID=22028&name=BrodyBrody has smoldering good looks. He's beyond handsome, very charming, totally social, loves everyone, and will win you over in minutes. Here's the real question. Can you handle being the second best looking one in the family? Sure, he can't have access outside when no one is home because he can and will jump a 7' fence, but that's not the real issue here. Are you secure enough to handle his good looks? Are you ready to be completely ignored when out in public? Everyone's eyes will drop to your dog and all you'll hear is 'omg, he's amazing! He's so soft! He's so sweet! He's so handsome!' You might as well not even be there. Brody will eat it up and you'll eventually have to say, 'OK, so it's getting really late and we've been here for 95 minutes and should probably get going.' Are you ready for that?This handsome boy is young, probably around 3 years old, and he's great with people and gets along with female dogs who like to play rough. He's got all of the energy that comes along with puppihood, but is smart and food motivated, making him fun to train. He's a Husky in every way, good on a leash, obedience trained, super loving and sweet, and going to make someone very happy to have him in the family! He would do best in a family with Husky experience. The minimum adoption donation for adults is $375 and the adoption donation for puppies is $500.

For more information and the adoption application for Fargo, please visit our website belowhttp://www.coastalgsr.org/dog_profile.php?ID=21785&name=FargoThis cutie was on the euthanasia list at the OC Shelter, but we thought he might prefer being rescued, instead! Now known as Fargo, this handsome boy has a new name to go along with his new life.Around 4 years old, this handsome boy has proven to be a smarty pants with a nose that never stops. He looks to have had no structure in his previous home and will do best with someone who has large breed experience (working dog experience a plus!). He's a big puppy, can be mouthy, and can be fearful around fast moving people whom he doesn't already know, so a low traffic home with no children is recommended. He is, however, super food motivated and follows direction like a well oiled machine, so he just needs to find someone who will work with him and allow him to grow into a perfectly balanced boy. Fargo loves his toys, his walks, is obedience trained, and a super quick study. He knows sit, down, stay, come, heel, swing, place, back, drop it, slip, hupf, nein, and then some. This handsome boy is ready to move into a home of his own!The minimum adoption donation for adults is $375 and the adoption donation for puppies is $500. This amount only partially covers the cost of veterinary care, boarding fees, and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs and is tax deductible.

For more information and the adoption application for Mack, please visit our website belowhttp://www.coastalgsr.org/dog_profile.php?ID=22001&name=MackSince he's been with us as of 2/16/18, Mack has decided to give up trying to be adopted and, instead, become a super model. He's ready to travel the world, have his picture taken in or out of clothes, and make lots of money, which will buy him lots of tennis balls and Kongs. We haven't had the heart to tell him he'd need an agent, so you could just adopt him and he'd actually be much happier!Mack is probably around 4 years old. He has a big ball drive and thinks he knows everything. He can read your soul, dog next door, and if you're trying to be a dominant male or have too much fun around him, he will let you know that's not allowed. He's a cop, a lifeguard, a know-it-all, and a best friend to those he loves. He has a special rear paw that looks somewhat like a tool elderly people use to pick up things in a cupboard that's out of their reach. You know, those things other people use to pick up trash. Mack is hoping to use it to pick *you* up. It doesn't stop him from doing all of the things other dogs do and it doesn't bother him at all- he'll still chase down balls and not be tired when you are begging for a break. It's his piece of flair and doesnt cause any issues, but is a conversation starter. If you have GSD experience and are looking for a loyal companion, Mack is your boy!While Mack loves kids, he is dog selective. He won't tolerate another male and only appreciates submissive female large dogs. He is not small dog nor cat friendlyThe minimum adoption donation for adults is $375 and the adoption donation for puppies is $500. This amount only partially covers the cost of veterinary care, boarding fees, and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs and is tax deductible. The adoption donation provides that all dogs will be spayed or neutered, receive current vaccinations, and are microchipped. If not, arrangements will be made on an individual basis ( i.e., puppies who will need to be altered by 6 mos old). Special consideration may be given to those willing to adopt older dogs or dogs with physical problems.",

For more information and the adoption application for Zoe, please visit our website belowhttp://www.coastalgsr.org/dog_profile.php?ID=21991&name=ZoeZoe is around 5 years old, great in the house, potty trained, is living with and gets along with large and small dogs, and adores going on long walks. The home best for Zoe will be one with shepherd experience who knows how to apply structure so that she doesn't get overprotective of her people. She's playful, sweet, and loves her people. However, Zoe can love one particular person in a family too much and will try to guard that person from the other members of the family, if allowed. The home that will work best for Zoe would be one where all of the members of the family take turns feeding her, walking her, and training her. Zoe can be stubborn but is very trainable. Zoe has also gained a large amount of weight since living in her foster home. She tries to eat the other dogs food in the foster home. She gets some exercise but not enough to help keep her weight down. Lots of dog walking would help Zoe lose the weight before it affects her health. Anyone who adopts Zoe will get a very loving dog, a loyal companion, but will also need to set limits and watch her diet.The minimum adoption donation for adults is $375 and the adoption donation for puppies is $500.

He's definitely afraid of traffic and is going to need a home that's willing to work with him. He's got one of the most expressive faces and adores the people he interacts with on a daily basis.The minimum adoption donation for adults is $375 and the adoption donation for puppies is $500. This amount only partially covers the cost of veterinary care, boarding fees, and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs and is tax deductible.

He's very smart and would be the perfect dog for a home with German Shepherd experience. He is high energy and great with adults, but needs to brush up on his canine skills; he was never socialized and doesn't understand how to approach nor react to other dogs. This handsome lad is well on his way to becoming a perfectly balanced boy. Zeus has completed obedience training and is learning more and more each day. He's very treat motivated and ridiculously smart, which makes him a quick study. Zeus loves people and he wants nothing more than to become your best friend! He would do best with older children, as he's rather mouthy when excited.The minimum adoption donation for adults is $375 and the adoption donation for puppies is $500.

For more information and the adoption application for Flynn, please visit our website belowhttp://www.coastalgsr.org/dog_profile.php?ID=21341&name=FlynnIf you met Flynn, you'd fall in love Flynn. When you first meet, he won't be in your face, licking you until you lose a layer of epidermis, cuddling you like he's known you forever. Flynn isn't in your face. He's more reserved and regal. He'll slowly become more interested in you and slowly start closing in on your personal space. He'll lean in, sort of asking for pets, but not begging, because that's beneath him. He'll lean in and then, when you pet him, he loses his mind and let's his whole charade fall into a million tiny pieces as he rolls over and asks for belly rubs, while still remaining classy. This handsome GSD has had obedience training (he knows sit, stay, down, come, shake, paw, roll over, crawl, watch me, go to your bed, get your ball, and then some), is crate trained, walks well on a leash, is very quick to catch on to new things, lived with children (he needs a home with kids who are 10 or older), is good in the house, potty trained, knows how to use a dog door, and is going to make someone with GSD experience very, very happy to call him their own! While he can be around other dogs and not act up, he needs to be the only dog in the home.The minimum adoption donation for adults is $375 and the adoption donation for puppies is $500. This amount only partially covers the cost of veterinary care, boarding fees, and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs and is tax deductible. The adoption donation provides that all dogs will be spayed or neutered, receive current vaccinations, and are microchipped. If not, arrangements will be made on an individual basis ( i.e., puppies who will need to be altered by 6 mos old). Special consideration may be given to those willing to adopt older dogs or dogs with physical problems.",

For more information and the adoption application for Gunner, please visit our website belowhttp://www.coastalgsr.org/dog_profile.php?ID=21838&name=GunnerHere's the thing about this really smart, handsome, smart, gorgeous, smart GSD: He's smart. He can also be stubborn. He's like a teenage boy in the body of a GSD. Gunner is just about the most well trained dog in our rescue. He's been working on his obedience game for over a year and knows all of the tricks. He has a relationship with certain volunteers in which he understands they are the leaders and he is the follower. Once you achieve that relationship with him, he's just about the most fun canine companion in the world! But, and here's the but, you don't have that relationship with him yet. As smart as he is, he's not a well oiled machine who is the same dog with different people. He is going to be a dream dog for someone who likes to work their dogs, but he is going to be a handful for someone who doesn't. Around 4 years of age, Gunner is your typical working dog with lots of energy who is smart as a whip, loves to run and play, and adores his people. He craves work, loves a job, and would probably enjoy agility. He's adorable, loving, affectionate, playful, and needs a home with GSD experience or he will take the lead position and become overly protective. If you're looking for a smart puppy who would love to be part of an active home, Gunner is your boy!The minimum adoption donation for adults is $375 and the adoption donation for puppies is $500. This amount only partially covers the cost of veterinary care, boarding fees, and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs and is tax deductible.

The couple with over 140 Shih Tzu type dogs living in filth in their upscale OC home? Odin was at the shelter and, when the shelter had to make room for all of those dogs, dogs like Odin were suddenly in danger. We offered to help and this handsome guy was one of the dogs who joined us in order to make room for all of those confiscated dogs.Odin is so handsome and bonds so quickly, it's hard to imagine how he landed at the shelter in the first place. We've found this big boy, who is 4 years old, to be a happy guy who loves water, chasing down balls, is working on his leash skills, has no bad reaction towards other dogs while on leash, and loves going for walks around town. He would like someone with GSD experience to give him structure and, in return, you'll get an amazingly loyal companion who will be your best friend for life.

For more information and the adoption application for Apollo, please visit our website belowhttp://www.coastalgsr.org/dog_profile.php?ID=21862&name=ApolloApollo is the proud father of our H litter that was born in 2017. (The mother was Gretchen, who was also available and has been adopted.) Their owner was a back yard breeder who was not able to care for Apollo, Gretchen, nor the H litter, so Coastal GSR took them all in, because we leave no dog behind. Apollo is 8 1/2 years old and has been ready since he was rescued to experience a real life. He doesn't ask for much. Just a nice place to lay inside and outdoors. He was primarily a back yard dog with his previous owner and wasn't socialized. He likes female dogs - no male dogs please. There are a couple of volunteers that he does like and he prefers men to women. If you have GSD experience and are the kind of person who knows that some dogs need more time to come out of their shell, especially ones who were just kept in a backyard and asked to breed over and over, then you're the kind of person this handsome boy has been waiting to meet. Apollo is good with female dogs and male humans, but is timid around people he doesn't know, as he was never socialized in his previous home.The minimum adoption donation for adults is $375 and the adoption donation for puppies is $500. This amount only partially covers the cost of veterinary care, boarding fees, and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs and is tax deductible. The adoption donation provides that all dogs will be spayed or neutered, receive current vaccinations, and are microchipped. If not, arrangements will be made on an individual basis ( i.e., puppies who will need to be altered by 6 mos old). Special consideration may be given to those willing to adopt older dogs or dogs with physical problems.",

For more information and the adoption application for Hercules, please visit our website belowhttp://www.coastalgsr.org/dog_profile.php?ID=22197&name=HerculesHercules is a gorgeous and well bred boy, approximately 5 years old, who grew up on a huge property as primarily an outside dog. He was occasionally allowed inside, was crate trained, house broken, but his main task was protection of the property. When his family downsized homes and wanted Hercules to city dog, they did a board and train at the same training facility we use and highly recommend. Being a smart GSD with lots of drive, he picked up everything quickly and showed his potential. No longer at the large property and now in a small beach side residence (in a heavily populated area), being an outside dog didn't work for their new neighbors and Hercules was taken back to boarding. He lived there for months until we were asked if we'd consider finding him a GSD savvy family who could give him the type of home he needs to thrive. The owners wanted what was best for Hercules, so they relinquished him and we promised to find his happily ever after.Hercules has a big ball drive, is easy on a leash, and really wants to please his owner, but will take over if allowed. He is looking for a GSD savvy home who can give him lots of structure, boundaries, and exercise. In return, he will make you wish you had found him sooner!The minimum adoption donation for adults is $375 and the adoption donation for puppies is $500.

For more information and the adoption application for Hank, please visit our website belowhttp://www.coastalgsr.org/dog_profile.php?ID=21190&name=HankThis is the face of a dog who will love you more than biscuits. This face will bring you balls to throw, because he knows it's your favorite thing. Well, he might bring you balls. He might not. He might know that you love him so much, you want him to hold all three balls in his mouth and experience bliss/ball nirvana. But, he might bring you balls. He probably will bring you balls, because he knows you adopted him and he owes his new life to you. He'll lean in for a cuddle, give you a wink, and let you know you're even better than balls. This is really unbelievable, but we've had Hank since November of 2014. He wasn't even a year old when we rescued him from the San Bernardino City Shelter... he's grown into those ears of his and turned into a gorgeous adult dog.Around 5 years old, Hank is not only gorgeous, but he also has a very playful personality and knows how to turn on the charm. He loves his people, is obedience trained, has a huge food and ball drive, and is as smart as a whip, but not a huge fan of strangers. Hank is seeking an energetic home that knows how to handle working dogs. He needs a home that can provide structure, boundaries, and has working breed or dominant dog experience, but he responds very well to leadership and is one of the sweetest boys you will ever meet!The minimum adoption donation for adults is $375 and the adoption donation for puppies is $500. This amount only partially covers the cost of veterinary care, boarding fees, and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs and is tax deductible. The adoption donation provides that all dogs will be spayed or neutered, receive current vaccinations, and are microchipped. If not, arrangements will be made on an individual basis ( i.e., puppies who will need to be altered by 6 mos old). Special consideration may be given to those willing to adopt older dogs or dogs with physical problems.",

For more information and the adoption application for Mimi, please visit our website belowhttp://www.coastalgsr.org/dog_profile.php?ID=22104&name=MimiDo you know what it's like to lose your human in a car accident, land at the shelter, get rescued, have major back surgery, then wait for someone to fall in love with you and take you home? Mimi does.You won't meet a sweeter nor peppier GSD than Mimi. She's been through a lot, but she's remained in great spirits and is always willing to cover you in kisses.Mimi's human was killed in a car accident and she was taken to a shelter by the extended family. We rescued her and noticed she was wobbly in the rear, so she went to see our vet. She had an exam, blood work, and x-rays, but our vet said she needed to see a specialist, so we scheduled an appointment with a really well known neurologist. He wanted to do a genetic test for DM before doing an MRI, but she didn't have the genes, so we kept moving forward.Mimi had an MRI that showed spinal surgery was an option which could better her life, so she went to Dr. Berry at Southern California Veterinary Specialty Hospital for a hemilaminectomy. Her surgery was a great success! So much so that instead of using a sling to help her walk because her back legs were weak, we used a sling to help keep her under 30mph, as she had use of her back legs and wanted to gogogogogo! She's been doing therapy to strengthen her back legs, is doing great, has a great attitude, and enjoys hanging out in the yard with her toys. We know what an amazing soul she is and we know someone else out there will see what we see: a ridiculously sweet, gentle, energetic, fun, lovable girl who isn't going to let a medical issue slow her down one bit. This classic beauty is great with people and gets along with other dogs, knows 'sit' and 'down,' and can't wait to have a family again. She can get protective of what she thinks is hers, so she'd do best with a GSD savvy family.The minimum adoption donation for adults is $375 and the adoption donation for puppies is $500.

For more information and the adoption application for Titan, please visit our website belowhttp://www.coastalgsr.org/dog_profile.php?ID=19449&name=TitanWe rescued Titan's mother, along with her eight puppies, from a high-kill shelter in June of 2012. Titan was quickly adopted, but his family wanted to return him 7 years later so hes been with us for over a year now. He was scared and unsure why his life was turned upside down, but we continue working with him and he's built relationships with the volunteers and come out of his shell more and more. He's absolutely adorable and sweet with the people he knows and is getting better about opening up to new people.This handsome boy is a big fan of balls and will elegantly leap into the air to catch anything you throw at him. Titan is good in the house, potty trained, good in the car, knows his basic commands, likes to give you his paw, and is working to further his obedience game. If you have GSD experience and are looking for an extremely loyal, fun-loving, handsome dude to be your ride or die and only dog, look no further.The minimum adoption donation for adults is $375 and the adoption donation for puppies is $500.

He's a young 9 ish in age, loving, snuggly, house-trained and crate trained. He puts himself in his crate to eat and to sleep (so cute). He is battling yeasty skin issues and under constant care of our vet until cleared up. He has dry eye which causes limited vision. He cannot go to a home with a pool unless fenced in. He can get grumpy so I feel he won't do good in a home with small children either. He is very good with the other dogs but prefers his chosen humans' lap. And his cuteness factor is off the charts (search for his kicking video on our FB page)! Won't you love to have this beautiful senior in your home?",

            "description": "Welcome Canelo to the Marley's Mutts family! Canelo came into our foster care after he was advocated by the shelter staff at Pima county because he was surrendered to the shelter because he became paralysed due to a herniated disc issue. His former family was unable to care for him and deal with his new needs. Canelo was severely overweight and had some very bad urine burns on his sensitive belly. His foster mom has to get his weight down and treat his burns before he could be outfitted with a wheelchair. This lucky pup has come a long way! He has slimmed down, gained some much needed muscle in his front legs, and cleared up his belly burns! Joeys Paw stepped in and donated a brand new wheelchair for him so he could be mobile again and give him a new lease on life! He has taken to his new wheels like a champ and is now looking for a home! Canelo can't be picky about new people and will get snarky, but he's just scared of new people and things. It just takes him a min to recognise that new people aren't out to hurt him. Were pretty sure that he never met new people at his previous home. Canelo does need a lot of daily care and cleaning up after. He no longer has control over his bladder and bowels and uses doggy diapers. He's basically a human toddler who can't walk just yet. If you would like to meet this wonderful wheelie dog, apply to adopt him today!

Give me a little time to get to know and trust you. We'll be friends in no time, I promise. My dream home would be one with patient adults who can help my build my confidence and don't mind my quirks, and a dog friend (or three!) to play and snuggle with.\n\nI'm an older fella with some manageable medical issues. I have arthritis and allergies, and I need daily meds and supplements to help me feel my best.

Maybe going out into your fenced backyard, gardening or relaxing with a book and cold drink under a tree? Do you run short errands around town occasionally?\n\nGuess what? Dilly does too!\n\nHe's not interested in hanging with any other animals! Just you! Oh, and your friends. (as long as they don't bring their pets!) kids might be cool too, as long as they are cool with him!\n\nDilly is a gentle giant! He loves kids, and all humans--and is not shy. He is around 70lbs currently. He would benefit from a fenced yard because he needs safe confinement to avoid chasing squirrels or other animals. A fenced yard is mandatory however rural households may be considered under certain conditions. Dilly walks great on a leash, and is perfect in the house and very relaxed. He is around 5 years old and fully vetted--neutered and vaccinated. \n\nHe enjoys relaxed activities outside and tends to be a lounger in the house. He will play with toys and utilize chews. Has no issues being left loose and alone in the house. Has been reactive/super anxious to crates and doesn't need one, nor do we recommend one for him. \n\nPlease private message us at www.facebook.com/allspecieskinship to meet him! If you do NOT have Facebook, call 877-596-7776. Dilly's adoption fee has been sponsored by his former adopter who could no longer keep him.",

            "description": "Status: Pending Medical Clearance\nLocation: Florida\nBIO:\nElsa estimated to be 13yrs old was found as a stray in the Tampa Bay area and had clearly suffered from neglect for a long period of time. She was completely forlorn and had no spirit left. She was also suffering from an inability to produce tears and her eyes were so crusted over she had become accustomed to sleeping with her eyes open because she couldnt shut her eyelids. (this photo in comments) These days Elsa is a happy dog! She runs around the house and yard, wags her tail and her NEW favorite thing is getting KISSES on the cheek from her foster mom!\n\nWould you be interested in sending a surprise to help Elsa's foster parent care for her? If the dog is over 13 or has medical needs we will be including a care list from the foster parent's via amazon.\nhttps://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1FJCO9MI0A4SI?ref_=wl_share\n\nYou can help sponsor her medical care by visiting http://www.igrescue.com/html/donate/financial_contributions.shtml\nMake sure to list that you would like your donation to assist Elsa-Gulf Coast Rescue\n\n*Please note that Elsa is unable to be adopted, until the Gulf Coast Rep and Rescue Vet give clearance.

After quite a bit of testing and health setbacks she was diagnosed with small intestine overgrowth and put on a daily supplement that has really helped. Cassie is a very funny girl who gets old lady zoomies frequently. She also likes to play the 'high ten game' with her foster mom. This consists of Cassie doing a bow and the foster mom bows back and then taps Cassie's Shoulders then in turn Cassie jumps up and 'High Tens' the foster mom on the knees. Cassie is a cuddle bug and has a cheeky attitude and ready to find her forever family =) \n\nUpdate: 4/9/20- Cassie has recently gone fully blind and with her age we have discussed with her foster mom about marking her as a hospice foster. Cassie is an amazing girl; but with her age, being blind, as well as having a hard time handling change we believe this is the best option for her at this time. Her foster mom has also let us know that she is currently on a homemade diet for both her meals morning and night.\n\nWould you be interested in sending a surprise to help Cassie's foster parent's care for her? If the dog is over 13 or a hospice foster we will be including a care list from the foster parent's via amazon. \nhttps://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1G8OLH5IXF26F?ref_=wl_share\n\nYou can help sponsor their medical care by visiting http://www.igrescue.com/html/donate/financial_contributions.shtml\nMake sure to list that you would like your donation to assist Cassie-Gulf Coast Rescue \n\n*Please note that if a foster is classified as Hospice we are happy to let them live out the remainder of their time with rescue. If by chance an adopter would be interested in inquiring about a hospice dog please email us at igrescuegulfcoast@gmail.com.  For Cassie's case we will recommend if an adopter is interested she be adopted into the Tampa Bay Region as her foster mom will like to offer support to the family*",

            "description": "Meet this handsome fella named Rebel! He originally came into the shelter December 5, 2019 as a stray and was never reclaimed. He was adopted and now back as of November 2020 when his owners were moving. He is now awaiting his chance at a great life. Rebel came in with a bad ear and skin infection and after a trip to the vet for a full exam he\u2019s got a good check up and should be on the mend. (Will need a home that can clean his ears at least 1 time per week and probably good for him to be on a once a day allergy medication.) He was taken care of food wise he\u2019s a healthy 75 pounds. Despite the discomfort he felt he is the sweetest gentle natured boy who is full of happiness and love to share. Rebel is around 6 years old and is current on his vaccinations,& now neutered. He keeps his kennel neat inside and loves to snuggle up in blankets on his bed. Will thrive once in a loving home where he feels safe and loved. Walks great on the leash and will bring a lifetime of unconditional love and companionship to the lucky person or family that adopts him. Seems to get along fine with most other dogs too. Stop by the shelter for a visit with Rebel today!! \nIf you have another dog and are interested in meeting another potential new furry member please bring him or her to the shelter and meet on neutral ground before adopting. No need to shuffle the animals around any more than necessary. Please know that 1 mosquito bite can create heart worms and they can be fatal if not treated. It is VERY important to keep your pets healthy and protected by keeping them on a once a month heart worm and flea/tick prevention. These animals are counting on you as their owner to provide them with lots a love and the proper health care so PLEASE make sure you are aware and prepared before adopting. Owning a pet is an extra expense and responsibility but is so worth every minute and penny you invest in them. They will add lots of joy and unconditional love if given a fair chance.\nThe shelter is open Mon.-Fri. 10-1, 2-5 and Sat. 10-4. Adopt a homeless pet and save a life. If you can not adopt right now come out and volunteer and make a difference in the lives of these animals while they await their FOREVER home.",

At close to 7 years old and 85 pounds he will make someone such a handsome companion.\nSt. Gatsby is a good natured and affectionate dog that is charming and full of life once you get to know him. He is smart, friendly, active and loyal. He knows come, sit, heel and off. He is also trained in targeting. Targeting is a training technique that teaches the dog to \"target\" or touch things with their nose.\nSt. Gatsby loves to have his back scratched and will lean into you to get more! He loves his squeaky toys and treats.\nSt. Gatsby would do best in a laid-back household. He needs a bit of daily activity but not an excessive amount.\nHe will need to be the only pet in an adult only household.\n\nTo foster or adopt St. Gatsby contact pawsinthecity.org\n\nDisclaimer: This dog will need a child-free home with experienced owners who will train with our Trainer. This training is included in the adoption donation.\n1/30/21 3:20 PM",

If you cannot handle the hound bark, this is not the boy for you. He has recently been diagnosed with dementia and separation anxiety and is on medication so he sleeps through the night. He has done well with the other dogs in his foster home and can be cat tested if needed. He is neutered, vaccinated, house and crate trained. He does have cloudiness in his right eye(looking at him) which indicates beginning of cataracts. He loves hanging out on dog beds.",

            "description": "Ginger (DOB 2007) came to FCSR as an owner-surrender, sort of... the owner asked her son to take Ginger to the Animal Shelter. A friend of the son stepped in and said let me find a rescue so the friend called FCSR.  Ginger has been in a medical foster home since coming to us on 11/9/19.  Before coming to us, she was living on a porch by herself, the owner fed her once a day and she had to go to the bathroom on the porch.  Poor Ginger was eaten up with fleas and her skin was in horrible condition with unbelievable hair loss. Ginger tested HW negative and has a clean bill of health with the exception of allergies.  At one point in her life, Ginger had an ear ablation on her right ear, however, her left ear in good condition. Here is the report from her foster family: \u201cGinger is a very sweet girl. Considering Ginger has not had a lot of attention in the past, she has trust issues.  She does not like to go out into the fenced yard; she likes to be walked on a leash.  In the beginning, she was scared of walking on the grass. Ginger will come sit on your lap once she trusts you, which took us about a month.  She doesn't give lots of kisses yet and is still trying to adjust to a new life in a house with a bed.  Her personality is starting to come out. She loves to root & rub on the blankets.  Ginger's favorite spot in on the end of the sofa; she needs a place to feel safe.  She sleeps on her own bed in our bedroom.  Ginger is a work in progress and her hair is starting to grow back.  She originally did not have a name, but her coat looks like it is going to be a beautiful light red, so we call her Ginger We got her a couple t-shirts and a sweatshirt to stay warm when it's cooler.  She gets along fine with her foster dog sisters; she hasn't had any interactions with cats.  If you are interested in Ginger, please fill out an adoption application at floridacocker.org. For more information, please call 813-245-1833 or contact info@floridacocker.org",

            "description": "Last weigh-in: 63.2 lbs\n\nFoster Update 02/2020: \nReva is still getting comfortable with people and is very gentle. She is starting to get used to us and even allows an occasional belly rub. She has a lot of potential and just needs someone with patience to help her feel confident. \n\nReva is described as: Slightly active, Leash trained & Gentle. \n\nMeet Reva!\nWe were alerted to a pup named Reva that is living under a house and needed immediate rescue. According to neighbors, she was born under the house and has lived there with her mom, Lady, for the last 11 years! She was never allowed inside the house. The owner told neighbors he had her spayed as a puppy and she has not had human touch after that day.\nOver a month prior to our involvement the owner of the house sold it and moved out - taking only Lady with him. Reva chased after the car but was too scared to get in. For the following six weeks, Reva continued her daily routine of roaming the neighborhood during the day and retreating to her abandoned house at night, crying out for her missing family. Luckily, her neighbors have been providing her food and water but they knew she needed medical care and were trying to come up with a plan. While searching for help on Facebook, one of the neighbors came across a dog that looked just like Lady on a local Lost & Found Pet page!\nAfter a quick message to the finder, it was discovered that the dog was Lady (now named Zooey) and had been found wandering on Sam Cooper near 240 a few weeks prior. The ladies swapped contact info and reached out to Streetdog Foundation with this incredible story.\nIt was discovered that Lady (aka Zooey) had escaped her new yard. We think she might have been trying to find her way back to Reva. Zooey is now adopted by her finder and both she and the neighbor are helped us!\nSeptember 21st we set out to set a humane trap and get her safe. Within no time at all she walked right in the crate where some Pirtles chicken was waiting for her. This girls long ordeal is over! Next we move on to healing her both mentally and physically.\nFor the physical part Doc noted she has juvenile cataracts that will develop over time but otherwise, with the exception of a couple of tooth extractions, is in very good health. Mentally we will now give her the space and time to acclimate to her new life.",

            "description": "Last Weigh-in: 71.8 lbs\n\nFoster Update 11/2020: Stormy prefers to be the only pup. \n\nFoster Update 7/2020: While Stormy is kid-friendly, she would thrive best in a home with older children (11 years + up). \n\nFoster Update 2/21/2019: Stormy's foster says she is highly trainable and very smart. She does well in a car, likes to fetch, and loves her toys. He also describes her as obedient, playful, affectionate, and goofy. \n\nFoster Update 11/26/2019: Stormy is super sweet, but when she gets excited, she gets a little mouthy. We are working on it, but it is a work in progress. She has not had an accident in the house and is really well crate trained. It's hard to gauge her true energy level because she is heartworm positive. She is super smart and has learned her name, sit, come, down, and bed in a matter of three weeks. She will be a great family dog, not to mention she is a wonderful guard dog. She has a deep ferocious bark, but little do they know, she would kill them with kisses.\n\nStormy is house trained and crate trained. She is moderately active and it is unknown how she would do with cats. \n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nOctober 7, 2019 in Memphis was rough. We had experienced incredibly hot temperatures for the prior month and no rain. Literally NO RAIN for 3 + weeks. On this night it rained almost 5 inches. It was the kind of storm that sneaks up on you - the sky opens up with rain and next thing you know the streets are flooded. The sky lit up all night long with lightning. And thunder. Rolls of thunder from far away and then blasts that woke up the whole house. This went on for several hours throughout the night and into the early morning hours.\n\nThat being the case, we were absolutely devastated when our volunteer that reads the intake emails (yes, everyone at Streetdog Foundation is a volunteer) opened up the first email and saw this picture. This sweet pup, who had recently given birth, was abandoned in a wire crate that night. Our hearts were shattered when we realized that she was left outside with no cover. No protection from the torrential downpour. No one to comfort or love her while the storms rumbled on all night. She was dumped with nothing but this crate and the tattered collar around her neck.\nWe were full. Every foster in our program had a foster pup (or two or three) in their home. We even had several dogs in boarding. But we had to say yes to this amazing girl. We had to have a chance to prove to her that not all humans are bad and that she is worthy of love.\n\nShe received a full checkup by \u2018Doc\u2019 at Grace Animal Hospital. This sweet girl tested positive for heartworms and had never been spayed. Well, we are on top of it and getting her healthy! As soon as those nasty heartworms are gone this girl will be ready to settle into her forever home! Forever Safe. Forever Loved. Forever Dry.\n\n* Behaviors not listed have yet to be tested.",

            "description": "Stone was found standing in the middle of a road by a kind man. He immediately contacted us because Stone had numerous scabs, open wounds, hair loss and scars all over the head, legs and body.  Both of his front legs were swollen. His tail and one of his legs had been broken. He was in horrible condition! We got him to the vet as soon as possible and discovered one of his front legs was possibly fractured recently. He was also loaded with parasites. Due to the location and shape of some of his scars, our vet told us he was probably a \"bait dog\", meaning dog fighters used him as bait to train the fighting dogs. Despite his condition and his past, Stone is so sweet to everyone!! He loves playing with dogs through the gate of his run and in the outside run.  He still acts like a puppy sometimes! He is food protective so he would have to be fed separately if with another dog. Our staff and volunteers have been giving him so much love and attention, and he is definitely enjoying his new life.  Stone's date of birth is 12/6/2017 and he weighs about 50 pounds. \n\nStone spent some time in a foster home and his foster mom told us this about him, \"Stone is so gentle and kind. He walks well on a leash, takes treats really gently, and is just a calm, quiet boy.\"\n\nYou can submit an adoption application for this sweet boy at http://www.fayettefcar.com/applicationform, where you can also review FCAR\u2019s adoption requirements.\n\nAll FCAR adoptable dogs have been spayed or neutered, are current on all vaccines, on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, microchipped, and come with a 30-day pet health guarantee. The adoption fee is $95 with an approved application. A fenced yard is required for Stone.",

This poor girl likely never knew the kindness of humans until her rescue in November of 2019.  She and her puppy were living on the streets and spent their days trying to find enough food just to survive.  Humans weren't kind to her and she became very fearful. When it finally became time to be rescued of wasn't an easy task.  Gracie was terrified and while she wanted to trust she couldn't get passed her fear.  Finally, a humane trap was brought in to bring her to safety.  That was the beginning of the beautiful relationship with her foster Mom Michelle.  Michelle was there from day one and has committed herself to helping Gracie come out of her shell and find the forever home she deserves.  Gracie did test positive for heartworms and has taken a round of doxycycline and is currently on heartworm prevention.  Her skin issues are caused by Demodex.  It's a non contagious skin condition and she is currently being treated. As you can see from her before and after pictures she's come so far.  Gracie loves kids and she gets along well with other dogs.  She is also housebroken.  Gracie has also been spayed, microchipped and is current on vaccinations.  \n\nA fenced yard and home visit are REQUIRED to adopt Gracie. For more information please contact her foster Mom Michelle 225-223-0910",

She\u2019s hilarious! She loves to play! She loves car rides! Walks! Hikes (as long as it\u2019s not raining!) Zoomies! Her person/people! Blankets! Dog beds! Big fan of West Paw brand toys! (It\u2019s her preference, I don\u2019t ask questions.) House trained! Loves her crate! Walks well on leash and is not leash reactive! Listens to commands! Comes when called! She doesn\u2019t love most other dogs but *could* live with the right one (probably a mellow, adult, male.) She doesn\u2019t want to live with kids, not yours or anyone else\u2019s. Not a big fan of strangers, meaning she probably won\u2019t like your sister/grandma/husbands 3rd cousin/obnoxious drunk uncle, etc. Would prefer to skip out on thanksgiving dinner festivities and just come out for some pie after everyone has left (same.) Doesn\u2019t want to go to your fianc\u00e9es parents house for a cookout. Really doesn\u2019t care about your friends dog park coffee and gossip meet ups. Now, if you need a dog to go on a coffee/beer pick up run with you, she\u2019s down and ready to ignore everyone, just don\u2019t expect her to make friends with Nancy or her chihuahua in the line next to you. She\u2019s a live and let live (in our respective corners) kinda gal.\n\nPLEASE DO NOT INQUIRE ABOUT VIOLET IF:\n-ANYONE under 18 lives in your home\n-You have multiple other dogs\n-You have cats\n-You have roommates\n-You are against crates\n-You are not open to balanced training\n\n\n*PLEASE NOTE: All dogs are in foster care all over MA & RI. They are NOT at the cat shelter in Acushnet, which is the address listed on Petfinder. There are ONLY cats there. We do not set up meet and greets with dogs until after you've been approved to adopt. Please do not email asking us if you can come by and meet a dog the same day.*",

            "description": "Krim is a strong, loving, cautious, alert, silly, playful and full of character girl. She was adopted out as a pup and returned when other members of the family brought home dogs that she couldn't get along with, thus causing her to lose her home. We believe Krim needs a home that loves the American bully cross with a Staffordshire or Pitbull. This breed combination is extremely loyal, affectionate and protective, so experience is absolutely needed for an adopter. Experience with either breed or both is a plus!\n\nKrim learns quickly, walks well on a leash, takes to training like a fish to water, swims in water like a true fish, plays with toys and doesn't mind sharing with her person, and will truly be a partner til the end. She has shown an inclination to attach to her handlers, so multiple person households have to work with her equally. We advise no little children as she is a big girl and needs an adult leader as well as a home that can focus on her needs. We also are looking for an active household that enjoys being outside, walking/hiking and exploring, this young lady needs her mind to be nourished by mother nature's medicinal presence.\n\nKrim is currently in a training program where she learns basic obedience, leash skills and socializing alongside new people and dogs. We expect an owner to be open to training and commit to learning about Krim alongside us.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Krim, please fill out an application at https://www.dogsaredeservingrescue.com/adoptable-dogs/adoption-application/",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website. All of our dogs and cats are in foster homes and we have no paid staff. If you have questions concerning a specific animal, PLEASE fill out an application and the foster parent will be in touch. We will not arrange any home visits with any of our dogs and cats until your application is processed. Please understand our foster parents are precious to our 2nd Chance family; without them we cannot function, so we do our best to not burden them with multiple appointments. Our foster parents will choose their top 3 applications and arrange home visits with these applicants. The adopter will be chosen at that time. The process can take anywhere from a week to a month. We want to make sure our little furry ones are placed in their 'forever home' and never have to go through a rehoming again!Well hello my name is Poodah. I am an elderly gentleman but I still have some spunk left in me. I'm not fond of being picked up and my legs are deformed but that is probably from birth. ( I of course know but have no way of telling the humans around me :)I hang out with the other ranch dude and today I even played with this young pup named Sally who kept jumping on me and knocking me over but I have to admit it was fun and I kept going back for more :)PS my foster mommy says I need to tell you I REALLY don't like baths and getting my legs played with doesn't make me happy.Please fill out an adoption application:\nAdoption application (Dog)\nAdoption Application (Cat)\n\nPlease understand we do not adopt out dogs to\nfamilies with children under the age of 5. We do not adopt dogs to renters. Some dogs will have fence requirements while others may not.\n\nA pet is a lifetime commitment. The dogs and cats in our system find themselves there, for the most part, because their humans did not have the same loyalty to them as they did to their owners. We do not take the adoption process lightly, and will do everything in our power to make sure the animal is placed correctly the first time around for your sake and theirs. Thank you for choosing to adopt not shop!",

She can be a little rambunctious sometimes, but that is just the pup in her. She would make a lovely addition to a loving family who can give her the time. She likes to run as she has a lot of energy, so a fenced yard would be preferable. \n\nPlease contact ccarfoster@gmail.com for adoption information!",

He only likes cats when they're on the dinner menu!\n He weighs 96 pounds and DOB is 8/20/13...All pets have lifetime sanctuary at Haven of the Ozarks. If they cannot remain with their adopter, they must be returned to the Haven.\n\nAdoption fees are as follows: \nPuppies under the age of 6 months - $125\nDogs weighing 30 pounds and less - $125 \nDogs ages 6 months to 5 yrs old - $90\nDogs over the age of 5 yrs old - $75.\nCats under the age of 6 months old - $75\nCats over the age of 6 months old - $65",

She is about 4 1/2 years old and weighs about 60 lbs. She loves nestling on the couch and playing in the yard. Her foster dad told us that she loves to swim and she is great at fetch! Check out the short video of her in the pool!\nTracie would do best in an adult-only home that is structured and consistent with experienced dog owners. She would do best as an only pet with no other animals in the home. Would you be the best match for her?\nTracie is spayed, up-to-date on vaccinations, and has completed heartworm treatment. She is a happy healthy girl ready for her forever home.\nTracie's adoption fee is $400.\nHow to Adopt Me!\nIf you are interested in learning more about me, and possibly making me part of your family, please go to wagoninn.rescuegroups.org .

Snickers does have an inoperable cancerous tumor on her jaw and because of this, she will live out the rest of her days in her amazing hospice foster home.\n\nSnickers doesn't need to be crated and is completely house trained. She lives with two other Dobermans and two parrots - she finds the birds interesting but is too good of a girl to interact with them.\n\nSnickers does great in public and loves to go for walks and get pets by anyone that she passes. Her typical day includes lounging around with her people and she is a pro-cleaner upper of snacks! Because of her tumor, she needs soft food and soft treats.\n\nSnickers is a total sweetheart and just wants to be by her people. We are blessed to have such amazing supporters that help us take care of our hospice dogs like Snickers!\n\nThis fabulous foster is a Doberman Rescue Minnesota foster dog.\n\nPlease read all adoption steps and policies carefully on our website. http://dobermanrescueminnesota.com/adoption-steps/\n\nQualified adopters are within the approved adoption area, and Adopter will be requested to visit this foster dog at the foster family home. Our foster families are generally located within a 250 mile radius of Minneapolis, MN.\n\nAll DRM dogs are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, health checked, microchipped, 4DX tested, and on monthly flea/tick and heartworm prevention.",

She was rescued from a Chinese Meat Festival truck. Volunteers and fosters have worked hard to get her to a comfortable point. She is improving daily. She enjoys lap time and playing outside! She\u2019s selective with her people, and needs a patient adopter.\n\nShe would be best in a home without young kids or men. She can\u2019t fully get over her fear of men, so we want to set her up for success. Someone who is home a bit to work with her and continue to boost her confidence would be amazing. Your dedication and patience will be rewarded with lots of love. \n\nDoes this girl sound like a good fit for your home? She is spayed, UTD on everything and microchipped.

            "description": "Celeste and Junior have quite the story to tell and are such special pups! \n\nThese two adorable and bonded besties were found starving and emaciated living under a house in rural Texas (see pics). They were left to fend for themselves for years that way and clung to one another for support.  Junior is so good with Celeste, he even lets her take food right out of his mouth!! \n\nWhen they were finally rescued, these poor babies were in rough shape but with time, love and some healthcare they are now thriving. Despite all they lived through, Junior and Celeste are the most sweet and loving dogs and will steal your heart. You need to meet them to understand just how sweet and awesome they are! They love to snuggle with their human and each other. Their foster mom is completely smitten!!! \n\nJunior and Celeste live on a farm with their foster mom and do well with other dogs and even Alpacas! Junior can tend to be a little too interested in cats, so we think a cat free home is ideal. Celeste had a double perianal hernia which has now been fixed but she still wears diapers in the event she has a little bit of a leak. Her favorite pair of \u201cundies\u201d are her hot pink and leopard and she is always up to date on the latest fashions :-) We know these two are not the easiest to find a home for, but we are confident their special someone is out there.  \n\nAll of our puppies and dogs come up to date on vaccinations, microchipped, spayed/neutered and dewormed. To fill out an application to meet this super special  pair, please visit www.snarrnortheast.org \n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, so there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $375 for adults / Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n\n\n",

He is a studious boy and completed a professional board & train program in Saratoga, so he knows all of his obedience commands. Striker isn\u2019t for everyone, but he could be for you! If you have experience with anxious dogs and are looking for a new hiking partner and best friend, Striker is your man. He can be dog selective, but currently lives with two others. He is on medication for his anxiety and doing well; this medication will need to continue, but is very inexpensive. Because of his anxiety, he is too nervous to be around small children and really needs a confident owner with dog handling experience to give him the best life. If you fit the bill, Striker will be your best pal!  Striker is in foster near Albany NY.  If interested, please submit an application on our site, www.mountainrottierescue.net!",

They were found together in a vacant lot, snuggled together to try to stay warm.  Kobe is a handsome boy who loves his people.  He's around 1-2 years old, and 50lbs.\n\nKobe loves his toys, and will happily play by himself but is great with other dogs as well, zero aggression.  He\u2019s super wiggly when happy, but loves to curl up on the couch and chill.  He\u2019s also totally housebroken and goes into his crate on command!  Kobe can be protective of his family, so should not be in a home with lots of guests, and should be allowed slow introduction to new people.  He would also prefer to continue social distancing in the future!\n\nPlease apply using our fillable app here:  https://forms.gle/eqEChRtYMPshWYuX8\n\n",

Sally has had it rough and would love her very own person to spend the rest of her days with.  Are you her person?  If so, text Gayla with Paw Project at 919-820-3217 to learn more about Sally.

Sweet Pea does not wish to play or cuddle with other pets in the home but does not mind that they are there as long as they respect her space \u2018bubble\u2019.  Sweet Pea does best being separated from other dogs whenever food is involved.\n\nCharacteristics:  Sweet, Playful, Belly Rubs, Special Needs, Loving, Cute \nBackground:  Sweet Pea was surrendered to our rescue in January 2020.\nFalling in love?!

            "description": "Due to COVID 19, and the Illinois Shelter in Place order, we have experienced an overwhelming increase in the interest of animal adopting.  We have been inundated with more applications than we can process, as we are an all-volunteer agency.  \n\nWe do sincerely thank you for your interest in adoption.  At this time, we will only be reaching out to applicants who may be a potential match for one of our available animals.  \n\nNOTE: WE ARE FOSTER BASED, AND ONLY FULLY APPROVED APPLICATIONS ARE SCHEDULED FOR A MEET AND GREET. \n\nAgain, we are all volunteers, and do our best to acknowledge/respond to all applications and inquiries, in a timely manner. \n\nPlease read the bio below - in it's entirety - before submitting an application.  \n\nThank you!\n\nSoldier was a Lake County stray that was unclaimed after sitting out his old time.  He arrived in poor condition, very underweight and understandably scared.  He is about 9-10 yrs old. We have no idea how long he had been on the run fending for himself.  When he arrived to his foster home he was very unsure.  He had just been neutered and was still a tad drowsy. Foster mom set up a large crate for him in the living room. Nice cushy pillow, soft blankets, stuffed toy. He observed the comings and goings of her household for several hours. \n\n48 hours later: he's much more relaxed, met the remaining pack of dogs. He eats with the others.  As a typical chihuahua he may seem to be unapproachable, but it's only an act. The right people, gentle, caring, patient he will easily adapt to. \n\nHe gets along with other dogs once he gets to know them. He doesn't play, but will cuddle with you. He is crate trained, but obviously prefers to be out.  He is potty trained.  He prefers women over men, but again, with gentleness and patience he will learn to trust. He has been around a child who is 4yrs old. She is an animal lover and knows how to respect animals.  He is also warm and loving and even grateful at times.  Applications at www.placingpawsrescue.org.\n\nADOPTION FEE: $350.00 The adoption fee includes all age appropriate vaccinations including rabies, HW test if age appropriate, de-worming, microchip, fecal, spay or neuter, Heartworm and flea and tick preventative.  ADOPTION PROCESS: PLEASE READ CAREFULLY The first step in the adoption process is to fill out an application online at www.placingpawsrescue.org. Once we review the applications, those applicants that are thought to be a good match will be contacted as quickly as possible. We ask that you please be patient with us as we are all volunteers. Then a telephone interview will take place, references checked and a home visit will be conducted. We will then arrange for you to meet the dog. We require that all family members, including current dogs meet the dog prior to adoption.  We put all of the known information in the animals description. If the animal is listed on the website, we are still accepting applications for that animal. We only remove the animal when the final adoption paperwork is signed. The best way to contact us is by email at placingpaws@yahoo.com. It is very difficult for the limited numbers of volunteers to return all calls. Thank you.",

At 5 years of age, he loves to run and play; with the proper training, he could be a great running partner. Preston loves toys and likes to play fetch and gets super excited when someone is ready to play with him. He is so joyful that his whole body wiggles when he is happy and excited.\n\nPreston does need slow and patient introductions when meeting new people as sometimes strangers can make him anxious. Preston does enjoy other dogs when properly introduced and has not been cat tested so we don't know how he feels about his feline friends. Since Preston's play style is high energy, we feel he would do better in a home that has only adults.\n\nIf you think you would like to meet Preston, please email placement@duckteam6.org",

If you see a pet you are interested in please call the Franklin Township Animal Shelter at: (732)-873-2500 ext. 6255 and leave a message with your name, phone number, and the name of the pet you are interested in.\n\nYou must leave a message so that we can return your call to schedule an appointment.\n\nSweet, affectionate, and playful --that's Syrus! He is almost 10 years of age, but don't tell him that! Syrus is full of puppy like energy, and would love to go to an active home with lots of backyard space. He was surrendered to the Franklin Township Animal Shelter post-neuter when he developed separation anxiety and related destructive behaviors after the surgery. Syrus would do best in a home where he is not left alone for any extended period of time. He loves attention and being around people, and is a pro at playing fetch! Every inquisitor, Syrus could use some additional training on leash manners, but is he attentive and simply needs direction. He cannot go to a home with cats or dogs. He may do well in a home with older children. \n\nOur adoption fee is $60 per pet with a discount available for adopting two animals together. All animals from the Franklin Township Animal Shelter are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and up-to-date on all age-appropriate shots prior to adoption. Dogs have also been tested for heartworm.\n",

He has worked a lot on training in his foster home, he knows sit, down, stay, wait, and leave it. He walks well on leash. Otis needs to be the only dog in the home, he is manageable out and about in public around other dogs but does not want to share his home. A home with a fence would be ideal for him as he loves to run and play fetch. Due to his size older children are recommended.\nPlease contact Purple Paws Rescue directly if you are interested to learn more about Otis.Pp2crescue@gmail.com",

I like walking on the leash and car rides.  I do like playing sometimes, but am mostly chilled out.\n\nI would like a forever home without young children (12+ or older), so I can relax and be a true family dog.  I do have a bite history, since I am older I like to lay around a lot, My previous owner didn\u2019t pay much attention to me and allowed younger children to jump on me and pull my ears and tail.  Older kids are great though they know how to play and not hurt me!\n\nPlease schedule a meet and greet, so I can finally find my forever home.  \n",

He's a big boy at about 25 lbs,,,, he's used to access to a doggie door and enjoys a slow stroll around a safely fenced yard area. He either needs one level housing or ramps to get around safely..\n\nBear seems to be quite popular as a peke name,,,, so this little guy is Bear the Third!! He came into rescue with another little dog when their person was unable to care for them anymore...... We don't think he sees real well,,,,, and a lot of his hair was missing when he got here,,, but with some care and time it's almost totally grown back and he's got a lovely black coat...\nHe seems to have fine social skills with other small dogs, not paying much attention to them and just wandering around minding his own business,,, and finding choice napping spots.\nIf you're looking for a rather low key companion, this little fella might be just who you want.",

Khloe is well behaved, house trained, and friendly to everyone she meets including other dogs. Khloe has seizure disorder and requires medication twice daily. We give her a special diet and Cbd oil that is also supposed to help with her seizures. She will still have a couple of seizures a month, so she would be best in an adult home with someone who is around a lot. This gorgeous little girl has the best personality and is very loving. Khloe is smart and very devoted. She would love to cuddle with you, but isn't clingy or needy. Khloe weighs about 9 lbs, is spayed, fully vaccinated and microchipped. Khloe is an alpha so needs to go to a home with a submissive dog. If you'd like to foster or adopt Khloe, please complete our adoption application found on dexterfoundation.com We're only adopting out to the Southern California area.",

            "description": "Kirk Here!\n\nI bet you have seen me around here before because I was wescued a year ago.  Are you in interested in adopting me? Please make sure you read my entire dating profile below before inquiring or applying for me.  These humans want what is best for me so they are not going to compromise on finding me my perfect furever home.  \n\nMy foster mom says I am a very typical Westie with lots of energy. She says it is what you might call nervous energy so I need a calm but active all-adult home where I can get plenty of exercise. I am always up for an adventure and LOVE leash-walks around the neighborhood, hikes in the country on my leash, and hunting bugs in the fenced backyard.  When I am stressed or if there is too much going on around me, I displays signs of \"canine compulsive disorder\" including licking the air, chomping my jaws without eating, rapid blinking, and staring intently for bugs that no one else can see. I am being treated with supplements and medications and it is essential that I continue getting them going forward. \n\nI need people who will take the time to get to know me and my specific needs until I trust you.\n\nMy furever family:\n\n\u2022will be patient and understanding. Sometimes I need someone to sit with me until I am ready for my leash for a walk, someone to continually try new methods to get me to eat my supplements and medications, and someone who understands that schedule changes, sudden movements, and loud noises are terrifying for me.\n\u2022will be an all-adult household with no contact with children (living in the house or visiting).\n\u2022will have a securely fenced backyard with a locked gate.\n\u2022will not have another dog, cat or any other small creature to stalk and catch.\n\u2022will be a Westie (or similar) experienced household.\n\u2022will have experience with \u201cdifficult\u201d personalities and will follow the guidance of the rescue.\n\u2022will have a vet team that will work with specific needs.\n\u2022will not put me in situations with humans I does not trust such as dog parks or public patios.\n\u2022will live within 1 hour of Houston, TX to minimize stress during travel and transition (Exception may be made for households within Texas demonstrating competence and expertise in handling behavioral issues).\n\n* Please note: Kirk is safe with us and will stay that way until the right forever home is found. We absolutely will not consider a home in which he will come in contact with children nor one without the required experience.\n\nKirk is about 5 years old and has been fully vaccinated, neutered, and microchipped. His adoption donation is $350 which includes 6 months heartworm preventative meds, free microchip registration, and a safety harness.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Kirk, please review the adoption process and fill out the application on our website: www.wsrh.com. *** Please describe your experience with dogs with behavioral issues.\n\nAll dogs are available until \u201cAdoption Pending\u201d is noted next to their names. WSRH DOES NOT HAVE A PUBLIC SHELTER. ALL OF OUR DOGS ARE FOSTERED IN PRIVATE HOMES. Approved adopters only will be invited to meet the dogs.",

Joshua , the Dad has blossomed in to a great dog, but his kids are still a big project. They were living on the streets with severe neglect and they were probably born feral. We had hoped to breakthrough with them by now but they are a work in progress. John Wesley is making the most progress of the 3 boys. If you have a heart to help, many times getting a dog like this in a home, has a miracle impact!\nIf you would like to adopt this sweet furbaby, please complete our pre-qualification application at this link: https://bit.ly/2CCVFPV\n\n#AdoptDontShop #TBCAnimalRescue",

            "description": "How can you resist this gentle couch potato cream puff?  Chayton\u2019s size is closer to a Boxer and his personality is closer to an English Bulldog.  Mild mannered, laid back, and affectionate. He is quiet, but will alert when needed.  He will also bark to let you know he needs to go potty.  His speed is that of a slow trotter instead of a runner. Chayton loves food and rubber Kong toys! Given his size, he is extremely easy to handle. Chayton is good with kids and other dogs.  \n\nFunny thing he does:  When he is playing with his canine foster brothers and sisters, he can be seen slowly jogging behind them when they play chase. (They could probably lap him twice\u2026). It is adorable to watch as he wants to engage, but just can\u2019t keep up with dogs that can run really fast.\n\nMost endearing qualities: Very affectionate and loving. Loves getting attention and belly rubs. \n\nSkills: House broken, Crate trained, Leash trained, Kennel, Sit, Down, Heel, Rollover.\n\n7 Years Old-72 pounds-Adoption cost $100\n",

            "description": "Gunner likes to play with his squeaky toys, play tug with his foster mom and chase small balls around. He loves belly rubs and meeting new people. Walks are the highlight of his day unless he gets to go on a car ride and that takes top prize. He's been known to sit in the garage for hours in the dark hoping for a car ride. Gunner is brave in a thunder storm but gets nervous when the broom falls down. He likes rolling on his back in the grass and taking naps in the sun. Gunner also walks very slowly around his foster mom's plants. It's officially called trancing though I like to say he's Hunting Wabbits. Gunner is house trained, knows sit and is trustworthy being left in the house alone. He will not chew on your things or accidentally knock things over being rough. He plays well by himself tossing his toys up and chasing them around the yard. When he's excited about a toy, he'll spin circles around it. Gunner sleeps on his back with his legs sprawled in the air without a care in the world Want to learn more about Gunner? Email his foster family at low_maintenance_girl@yahoo.com.

            "description": "UPDATE NOVEMBER 17:  One of our very active volunteers took Decker home for some TLC and a break from kennel life.  He has known Decker a long time, and wrote the following:  \n\n\"Decker was awesome on his \"break\" from the kennel.  He's much better on a leash than he used to be when he was at the previous kennel.  I've had him at our house and he's been great with our dogs, played well with toys, and most surprisingly he hasn't seemed to care about our cats. He came nose to nose with one of our cats that was up on a table and he just smelled the cat and walking away. After that both cats stayed up on that table for a while and he didn't stalk the table or really seem to be interested in them at all. I was so happy about the change in him!\"\n\nPHOTOS:  Virtually all of our dogs have online PHOTO ALBUMS through SmugMug with LOTS of additional pictures.  Just copy and paste the link below into your browser (or simply type it in) and then search for the dog's \"gallery\" by name\n\n          http://adoptasleddog.smugmug.com\n\nVIDEOS:  In addition to photo albums, almost every dog has a video which will give you a much better \"feel\" for his or her personality.  NOTE:  In the new Petfinder format, it has become quite a bit more difficult to find and to play videos.  Please PAGE THROUGH the photos, looking for a photo overlaid in the center with a \"play\" arrow inside a circle.  This icon is white, so it can be difficult to see. \n In many (most) cases, the video is the last photo displayed as you page through.  Just click on that photo and it will play.  Please make sure you CHECK ON THE PETFINDER VIDEO ICON, above, to see a video of this wonderful dog!  Our videos will include, at a minimum, whatever info we had on the dog upon (or shortly after) his/her arrival into our program.  There will sometimes be video updates as well.  And in every case, our Adoptions Coordinator can be emailed at ADOPTASLEDDOG@AOL.COM to answer questions and provide the most current information we have on the dog.  \n\nNOTES:  Please see video or contact our Adoptions Coordinator at ADOPTASLEDDOG@AOL.COM.\n\nADOPTION DONATION:  $250  Before adoption, all Northern Lights dogs (regardless of whether Petfinder's symbols appear) are spayed or neutered, microchipped, heartworm negative, fully vaccinated and tested/treated for known parasites.\n \nWHAT TO DO IF YOU WANT TO ADOPT THIS DOG:  Email us at ADOPTASLEDDOG@AOL.COM to request an application and get started.  WE DO NOT HAVE AN ONLINE APPLICATION - you will have to request one via email.  We will review your application to determine if there is a good fit between you and/or your family and this dog.  We may suggest another dog or dog(s) if we can offer a better fit in terms of lifestyle, experience, other pets, etc.  A vet check, reference checks, and a home visit will be conducted before an adoption can be considered for approval.  \n \nNORTHERN LIGHTS DOES NOT HAVE A PHYSICAL SHELTER.  We are a nonprofit rescue organization comprised of individuals who open their private homes to foster dogs in need of a second chance..  When fosters are not available, we often pay to board a dog until space is available.  New fosters and donations to pay for boarding are always desperately needed us.  Email us at KATYLIED2@AOL.COM if you are interested in donating or for information on fostering.\n \nFAQ:  For information regarding our organization, as well as adoption policies and practices, please visit our Petfinder Home Page at WWW.NORTHERNLIGHTS.PETFINDER.COM.\n \n \nNOTICE:  In the vast majority of cases, the dogs in our program and rescued from shelters, and Northern Lights has no means by which to collect or verify a dog's history.  We work in concert with our veterinarians, and breed and age estimates are based on a combination of professional input and our collective experience.  Our policy with information acquired prior to acceptance and while the dogs are in our care is that of \"full disclosure\".  It is our goal to ensure the adopter has all available information to ensure the best possible match between the dog and the adopter(s).  If we have identified a behavioral or health condition while the dog is in our care and custody, every effort will be made to correct it prior to adoption, OR the adopter will be made aware of the issue or condition prior to adoption.  Northern Lights' screening process is designed to identify only those adopters who are willing, and have the means, to treat conditions which may occur after adoption, and the adopter will be contractually responsible for doing so. However, Northern Lights' policy is to accept any adopted dog back into the program, at any time, for any reason.\n",

He's always up for a game of fetch and loves to trot around the yard or go on a hike (he's also chill in the car). Everyone who meets him just loves him. While at the NYC shelter he became a staff favorite with his winning smile and charming personality. His foster thinks he's just awesome. We know you will too.\n\nTiger can get a little excited when playing (jumpy and mouthy) so a home that can work with that would be ideal. He's good with older kids, but he might be too much pup for a home with smaller children. He's still puppyish at 3 years old, but he's quite calm in the house. While he tolerates other dogs outside, he should be the only pup in the house. Tiger is truly a wonderful companion. Inquire about him today.\n\n\n\n",

He came to us two months ago from a temporary home where he \u201cplayed too rough with their Great Dane\u201d and was covered in scratches, scars, punctures and tears. After receiving weeks of medical care these wounds healed and he was neutered and brought up to date on vaccines.  He has a very negative/aggressive reaction to most everyone, except his current foster, when they come near his kennel or close to him when crated. He seems ok with most people outside of his kennel or crate but has not been socialized or allowed to get close to other people. He walks decently on a leash, usually sits when told, comes most of the time when called, like to ride in cars and will tolerate a muzzle pretty well. He becomes extremely agitated if you put a metal choke or prong collar on him. He show no food aggression with his foster and will play gently with her. He doesn\u2019t seem to show aggression towards other dogs but knowing how chewed up he was, we have not put him with any. I don\u2019t know his age. I don\u2019t think he was ever socialized or trained.",

With her hard life if does take time for her open up.\n\nShe is wonderful in a home. She is being fostered now and lives with small older dog and older kids but we're not sure how she'll do with other dogs and young children. We do know she does not do well around cats. She is loving, affectionate, smart and likes to play with toys.\n\nShe is a sable coat and brown eyes. She is medium sized with a short coat. Sophie would be great with a person or family who can give her lots of love, time, and patience to let the true Sophia come out.\n\nEven with a hard life, Sophie is so smart, likes to play and is a super girl. She's patiently waiting for her fur-ever family so she can show you some unconditional love. If you think this family may be you, if so please fill out an adoption application at www.doggiebonez.com so that we can schedule a meet and greet. She is also on all of our social media pages IG: @Doggie_Bonez_Inc_ and Facebook: Doggie Bonez.\n\nIf adoption isn't an option, please consider fostering one of our pups. We are a volunteer run non-profit dog rescue and always welcome new short and/or long term doggie foster families. We greatly appreciate the help and time of our fosters. You provide all the love, comfort and safety of a home and we supply you with everything else you may need, dog food, dog bed, toys, medical attention (if needed) etc. If you are interested please visit www.doggiebonez.com to see all of our available dogs who need a foster family while waiting for their fur-ever home and complete the foster application.",

She was trapped running with two larger dogs. The dogs hunted chickens and cats to survive. We are so grateful that Angel got into the trap because the other two dogs were shot and killed by irate neighbors.\n\nAngel is 28 lbs and very healthy. She is stout and compact and would be great as a hiking companion or just a good little dog to sleep in your bed.\nAngel is making slow progress in becoming a pet. We have  built a good relationship and I can touch her all over and pick her up. She is still not used to a leash but she comes when called and is very obedient. She is very food motivated and that will be the key to continuing her socialization. \n\nAngel lives at a pet hotel and is exposed to many dogs each day. She is playful and confident with other dogs. She is very fond of our 15 year old Lab mix. She sleeps with her and eats with her and generally takes comfort in being near her.\n\nAngel will take treats from strangers but that's as far as we have gotten. Let\u2019s face it Angel needs a lot of work. She will need a patient, competent leader to continue her progress. \n\nAdoption Fee $50\n\nPost for Susan\n",

            "description": "Medical costs to date: $2,128.25\n\nWe have never wavered from our original Mission Statement (Dated 2004) of helping Scotties no matter their age or health concerns. Skyler is proof of our continued commitment to the dogs that are many times left behind.\n\nIf you can help us in any way with a donation, please give what you can. We have had several high-cost illnesses and a major surgery with our long term rescues. Please help us so we can continue to help them.\n\n2-1-21: Skyler returned to the vet today for additional urinary issues, including leaking when sleeping. He is starting another round of antibiotics and will begin taking an incontinence medication twice a day.\n\n1-8-21: We are happy to report Skyler is doing better after starting antibiotics, but we will continue to monitor him closely.\n\n1-5-21: Skyler began urinating blood today and having problems defecating. We immediately rushed him to our wonderful vets. After an exam, x-rays, and ultrasound, it was determined his prostate is greatly enlarged and his bladder walls are thickened. No urinary infection was found, but these are not always readily detectible. Antibiotics and pain medication have been started. He is now back at his foster home with his girlfriend Shelby (our blind rescue Scot). He will spend the night in a room with sealed flooring, so he can have accidents that can easily be cleaned. We want to encourage him to relieve himself whenever he feels the need during the night. We are hoping this is just a small setback, however, it could also be the beginning of more serious issues. He will return to the vet in 10-14 days (sooner if he is not responding to the medications). We are concerned with his health, but optimistic our most senior Scot is on the mend.\n\n9-2-20: Skyler continues to amaze us. At his age, he remains quite active (with a little help from joint supplements). He has befriended our blind Scottie girl \"Shelby\" and they are quite the pair.\n\n5-20-20: Skyler's pathology report was inconclusive with the oral mass that was sent out for analysis.\n\n5-14-20 Skyler required a dental cleaning today due to some painful areas in his mouth. Despite having good results from dental x-rays and the cleaning, there was one area of concern that had the doctor remove one of his canine teeth and send to a pathologist for analysis. Once the results are received, we will post more here. Obviously, any area of concern with a 15-1/2 year old Scottie is troubling, but we will await the pathology report.\n\nThis handsome wheaten boy came to us through absolutely no fault of his own. He has been loved by the same family since he was a pup. Skyler is 15-1/2 yo and has had lifelong medical care. In addition, we have just had a full senior exam performed, including x-rays and ultra-sound, blood tests, urinalysis and fecal. The blood tests revealed some abnormal liver values, which led us to an ultra-sound of his liver. A biopsy revealed possible cancer, but only major surgery would reveal the true problem. In collaboration with our vets, we have declined surgery for Skyler, due to his age, a heart murmur and the possibility of spreading cancer cells to other organs. Even if we proceeded with surgery, there is only a very small chance surgery would remove the mass, hence our collective decision.\n\nSkyler's favorite pass-time is being near someone. He will follow you around the house, help you cook meals (hoping you will drop a tidbit) and lay at your feet when you are at a desk or computer. Such a love bug!\n\nOur commitment to dogs like Skyler cannot be fulfilled without your help. If you care to donate to Skyler's medical and fostering care, it would be appreciated.\n\nDonations may be made via www.paypal.com to email address:\n\nDonate@scottiekingdom.com\n\nor via USPS, to PO Box 551265 ~ Dallas, TX 75355\n\n- - - - - - -\n\nAll dogs adopted by Scottie Kingdom Rescue, Inc. have had a full medical exam by one of our licensed Veterinarians, which includes testing (and treatment, if necessary) for Heartworm disease, Lyme disease, Ehrlichia and Anaplasmosis, all necessary vaccinations, spay/neuter surgery, dental cleaning as necessary, microchipping, registration of the microchip, and any other medical needs each particular dog may need. Copies of all available medical records are transferred to you when the adoption is finalized.\n\nWe prefer to adopt to families with past Scottie, Westie, Terrier experience, but realize this isn't always possible. We do NOT ship our pets. If you have that special place in your heart, and in your home, for a Scottie (or any of our other available rescue dogs), please visit us in Dallas for an in person meet & greet session with our available dogs. If you have existing dogs, they should travel to Dallas with you, so we can be assured that they will be compatible with the new addition to your family.\n\nPlease contact us at\nRescue@scottiekingdom.com\nto receive an Adoption Application or for more information on our Adoption process. Also, please take the time to visit our website\nwww.scottiekingdom.com\nfor additional information.\n\nWe sometimes receive several applications on the same dog. Our goal is to place the dog in the best home possible, based on his/her needs, personality and past history. Please note: Adoptions are not done on a first come, first served basis. Submitting an application does not guarantee the adoption of any dog. We are looking for the best available home for each of our rescue dogs.\n\nThank you for your understanding, and for considering adoption!\n\nWe are\nnot\nsupported by your tax dollars or public grants, rather, we rely on donations to help us continue our rescue work for animals that are in need.\n\nDonations may be made via PayPal to email address:\n\nDonate@scottiekingdom.com\n\nor via USPS, to PO Box 551265 ~ Dallas, TX\n\n75355",

            "special_needs_notes": "Kaya was very sick when she came to rescue.  She had a ureter that was not attached to her bladder and urine dripped straight through her.  She also had entropion which caused a lot of irritation on her eye.  She had multiple studies on her bladder and eventually a very extensive surgery to reattach her ureter.  She also had surgery to repair her eye condition.  Currently Kaya is health and happy and we are looking for a medical home.  She no longer drains urine straight through her, but does have some mild dripping of urine onto her fur.  She squats and pees otherwise like a normal dog.  Due to the dripping though, we had made a decision to keep her as a sanctuary dog.  We have rethought this decision and wanted to reach out for a medical home where Kaya can still live a normal life without having to remain in a kennel the rest of her life.  We are seeking a special home that can manage a dog with this condition.  It requires wiping off probably once daily any damp fur and otherwise she is an energetic, mid energy girl who loves being outside exploring.",

Born in 2010 he is considered a senior, but far from an old man. He can sometimes be grumpy about handling due to his minor arthritis, but he can also be an affectionate teddy bear when he's in the mood. Galahad really enjoys car rides and may need a ramp or stairs to get in. He's also a fan of afternoon naps on the couch or watching midday television. Galahad gets along with dogs outside the home, but he prefers to be the only pup in the home. He would do well in an adult-only home that is patient and willing to help Galahad acclimate. Come meet Galahad today!",

My brothers and sisters have been worked with to be domesticated and have been successful with Pets Alive's adoptability program, and they've all been adopted! I am a great candidate for a sponsorship to get me the help I need through our training program!\n\nTo sponsor me, this is the link to learn more! http://petsalive.org/sponsor.html",
