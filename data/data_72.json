WE are a high intake No Kill Shelter ran by a staff of 4 and do not always have time to answer every question asked by so many. If you are a good fit for the animal you are interested in -we will call to speak with you, If we feel you are not a good fit , we will contact you about other pets that may be a good fit for your home. Many people are losing the opportunity to adopt the animal they want because they fail to put in an application and the pet was adopted before we could answer your email. .If you have applied for an animal in our facility and have not received a response within 7 days, PLEASE call or contact us again. Though we do our best in trying to answer all emails in a timely manner, sometimes things get away from us, get lost or misplaced. It is never our intention to ignore a request about an adoptable animal in our facility.\n\nSandy Brown, Director, PAW Animal Shelter\n\n319-372-2274",

WE are a high intake No Kill Shelter ran by a staff of 4 and do not always have time to answer every question asked by so many. If you are a good fit for the animal you are interested in -we will call to speak with you, If we feel you are not a good fit , we will contact you about other pets that may be a good fit for your home. Many people are losing the opportunity to adopt the animal they want because they fail to put in an application and the pet was adopted before we could answer your email. .If you have applied for an animal in our facility and have not received a response within 7 days, PLEASE call or contact us again. Though we do our best in trying to answer all emails in a timely manner, sometimes things get away from us, get lost or misplaced. It is never our intention to ignore a request about an adoptable animal in our facility.\n\nSandy Brown, Director, PAW Animal Shelter\n\n319-372-2274",

She will also be spayed after puppies are weaned.**\n\nMilan is an 11 month old female husky mix that was rescued from an abusive situation in Missouri. She is great with dogs, cats and chickens. She is also an expectant momma. The Italy Litter is coming soon!\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Milan is $400. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

She is currently in foster in Colorado waiting for a new family.  She is truly a sweet dog that loves to climb in your lap and snuggle.  She is truly a lover dog and needs that kind of love returned.  She would be a perfect dog for a couple or single person that doesn\u2019t have any other pets.  She would also be best in a home without small children, sometimes she doesn't know how big she is.  She doesn\u2019t do well with other dogs which is the main reason her current foster can not keep her.  Her foster loves her to death and knows she will be amazing for a single person or couple with no children.  She is hoping to find her family for the holidays.  She would make a great hiking buddy or even a long walking buddy.  If you would like to meet sweet Meg please fill out an application at\n\nwww.lowridersofthewest.org\n\nMeg\u2019s adoption fee is $375.00 - she is spayed, up to date on all her vaccinations and chipped.\n",

Nice to meet ya!  \n\nWATCH MY VIDEO:  https://youtube.com/shorts/NLcPVEpmMCM\n\nhttps://youtu.be/1tXnnodjV3s\n\nIf you like me, ask my foster for a better video!\n\nA nice person came along and took me in and, now, I am ready to hit the road to your house!  Uh, make that \u201cour\u201d house, OK?  I definitely need a house with a fenced-in yard cuz I need room to run and romp and be safe!  The rescue requires (1) a fenced-in yard and (2) a vet reference from a vet that you have used for a current or previous dog to be sure that all vetting was done.  \n\nI am a Whippet/Terrier mix.  I am 8 MONTHS old and I weigh 25 pounds.  I will probably weight 35 - 40 pounds fully grown. I have been neutered and am up to date on vaccines so I'm ready to go to my new home with YOU!!  Those funny-looking 2-legged creatures said I\u2019m also microchipped \u2013 whatever THAT is.  At any rate, I am fully vetted.  Is that anything close to petted?  I love to be petted!  They say I'm precious.  Hmmm, Is my name Trevor or Precious?\n\nWanna hear some more good stuff about me?  OK, here goes.  I like ALL people and ALL dogs.  I need to have a DOGGIE SIBLING so we can run and romp together and burn up LOTS and LOTS of energy!   If you don't have a doggie sibling, I need someone who can play with me and love on me a w-h-o-l-e lot!  How about all day and evening, every day?  OK?\n\nI have lots to learn.  Will you teach me all the things a pup needs to know to be safe and happy? I LOVE to give kisses so get ready!  \n\nIf you have children, then need to be older children - 12 and up because I like to play hard and run fast!  It's fun!\n\nSince I was rescued, I've learned to use a doggie door at my foster's home.  Smart, huh? I like to take naps when I'm tired from playing.  I need  love, exercise and couch-sitting when we get tired!  Let's be a team, OK?\n\nIf you would like to take me home (and you know you do), please email rescuedogsgalore@gmail.com  and they can get me on my way to a new and loving home!  Once you adopt me, I will be flown to Seattle from Houston, TX.  (That's the only place we can fly to right now.)  My adoption fee is $450 and includes my vetting, neutering, flight cost, travel crate, Health Certificate and a microchip.\n",

            "description": "Berlyn is a gorgeous 2 year old, 60 lb. Lab mix. We are looking for a special home with patience and hopefully room for her daughter who is not a Labs4Rescue dog. Berlyn is house trained, has perfect house manners, and is great with other dogs, cats, and kids. Berlyn is very sweet and affectionate and has medium energy, she's playful, but not hyper. She was rescued from a hoarding situation and when we got her, she was afraid of everything. She has come a long way, but is still nervous with new people and new places so her adopter will need to be very patient and understanding to help her be comfortable. Berlyn has some separation anxiety and she would love a home where she isn't left alone for long periods. Berlyn's new home should have a physically fenced yard and she should never be walked off leash.\n\nFor additional information about Berlyn please email Marla Cox at mclabs4rescue@gmail.com. \n\nBerlyn is being fostered in New England.\n\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION: We receive many questions about our adoption process from potential adopters, most of which can be answered by viewing our \"Adopt a Lab\" page on our full service website, https://labs4rescue.com/.   To expedite the process, please follow the step-by-step instructions outlined and submit an adoption application listing 3-5 dogs of interest. Please hurry as your new best friend is waiting for you!\n\nADOPTION FEES: $445 non-refundable adoption fee for all vet expenses (spay/neuter, shots, etc.) and transportation to ensure your lab gets to you in a safe, professional manner. All fees may be paid using PayPal, cashier's checks, or money orders. Labs4rescue does not accept personal checks for adoption fees. All adopters must pay their Labs4rescue adoption fee prior to the rescue shipping their dog.\n\nResidents of Massachusetts or New Hampshire are required to pay an additional $125 fee, which defrays the cost of their state's mandatory 48 hour isolation and examination by a licensed veterinarian.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Looking for a an active, amazing, easy-go-lucky boy? Major is your guy! Major is right at 2 years old and came from the streets of Texas. Like so many of our dogs, he has had to fend for himself for a long time, yet you would never know it from his personality.\n\nMajor loves kids, shows no interest in cats, and plays well with the 6 other dogs at his foster's house. He thinks running, chasing balls, and playing with the people is the best day ever. Major is a high energy dog and would do best in a household where there is plenty of opportunity to play, hike, run, and just have an all-around good time. Don't forget to leave room from him to snuggle with you on the couch at the end of the day!\n\nWith his intelligence, Major will be a fun dog to train. He has little to no training and will highly benefit from some good training sessions. He is learning potty training. (When a dog lives on the streets, there is no such thing as the \"right\" place to go!) He does walk nicely on a leash and thinks car rides are amazing. His foster is currently working with him on a little food aggression issue that is a throwback to his street days. Again, this will all come with training.\n\nAre you looking for an active boy that you can bond with over some great training sessions? How about someone that is happy to see you anytime and loves having the people to play with? Major is a win on both fronts. Major is currently fostered in Winchester VA and looking to talk with you!If you are an approved adopter and are interested in this dog, please let your case worker know. If you are not yet an approved adopter but are interested, please complete an adoption application!\nYou can review our adoption process, www.shenandoahrescue.org/adoption-process if interested. Donations can be made at shenandoahrescue.org/donate or on PayPal to info@shenandoahrescue.org",

            "description": "This sweet boy is Bubba. He was found near southern junction on 276 in Rockwall on 12/11/20 and never reclaimed. He is a male, 6 year old Chocolate lab/Bloodhound mix who weighs a whapping 97 Lbs.! Bubba is a big boy! He is also a love bug and is very social with people. He does well with kids and would love a family that will play with him. He also loves to go on walks but can be more of a puller when on a regular collar. So a harness is definitely recommended. Bubba appears to be crate/house trained and knows some basic commands too. He does not do well with other dogs and is not suggested with cats. He just likes to be the center of attention. Bubba is not one that can be left alone in a back yard alone as he has proven to be a little bit of an escape artist. He can very easily escape a chain link fence so he will need a home with a wooden fenced in back yard or something like it. He just gets very scared that he will be abandoned when he is left alone in a backyard for extended periods of time. Once he gets good and settled in a home and builds trust his anxiety should subside. Other than that and his dislike for other animals, Bubba is a really good boy and just needs a family to love. His adoption fee is $125 which includes my neuter, rabies, microchip, basic boosters, and heartworm test. Bubba is heartworm negative!

            "description": "Introducing Helga-don't worry, she will not be upset when/if you decide to change her name :) She is a 30 pound, 9 month old pitbull mix. She has the cutest facial expressions and super fun ears. She loves to go for car rides, even though it sometimes upsets her tummy. She gets super excited to go trail running with her foster mom and enjoys walks around the neighborhood. She loves to do zoomies in the backyard.\n\nHelga is fostered with kittens, puppies and adult dogs. Helga attaches herself to her people very quickly. She loves to spend lots of time with them! Because of her love for her people, she has some jealousy issues when it comes to sharing them with other dogs. In order to overcome these jealousy issues and perfect her sharing skills, she needs an owner that will set firm boundaries. With additional training for both her manners and sharing skills, she can learn to share her people with other dogs in the home.  Helga is overly interested in the cats in her foster home and would likely do best in a home without cats.\n\nWhen Helga came into rescue, we learned she is nervous of new people. She needs time to adjust before they\u2019re best friends! She should not be rushed into new situations so she can acclimate and adjust accordingly.  Once she is comfortable around you, Helga's entire body will wiggle when she greets you. She is eager to please her person and is intelligent, often learning commands very quickly. Helga has such a fun personality when she gets to know you and trust you.  If Helga sounds like the dog for you, apply today!  Her adoption fee is $250.\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

We have discovered that the one thing Crystal loves is having us sit with her and pet her. She is truly a dog that thrives on affection and being with a special person. She becomes so calm, ignores all the noise and just gazes up at you with complete adoration while you are with her. We wish people could see this side of Crystal, she just needs a calm gentle person and a calm quiet home where she can be the only pet. \nCrystal is an energetic girl who loves to play fetch and go for long walks in areas that are not busy with a lot of other dogs. She knows the command for sit and likes to play with toys, and her favorite activity is being with the one she loves. Crystal is looking for an experienced home with people who will understand that she needs a steady routine, lots of love and affection, and a secure 6 ft. fenced in yard so she can play, get her energy out, and relax safely when she goes outside. Crystal will be the love of your life and if she gets the right home she will be the best dog.\n**If you are interested in adopting Crystal, please contact the shelter at 509-662-9577 to schedule an appointment to meet her!",

He is high energy, so an active family would be best. Mufasa is good with older teen kids and another dog who is about his size or larger and can keep up with him, though being an only dog would not a bad idea. He is very strong, so needs a confident handler to teach him leash manners. Mufasa does have a high prey drive, so smaller dogs and animals like cats, chickens, or hamsters would not be a good fit.\n\nIf you're interested in adopting Mufasa Daniels, please complete an adoption application at www.ehrdogs.org.",

The pictures dont even do justice to showing how emaciated she really is. Despite the nightmare Imani was living, she still LOVES people. She has a wonder disposition and takes treats very gently. Imani is only about 1-2 years old. She will need some work with housebreaking but she seems very smart and we expect her to catch on quickly. Imani does well with calm dogs with proper introductions, but she does resource guard with other animals. She initially tested ok with cats, but has since shown very questionable behavior with them. At this time we would recommend a home with no cats. Imani is very energetic and still very puppy like, so training classes are a requirement with Imanis adoption. Imani is now healthy and is scheduled to be spayed. We are now accepting adoption applications for her. We posted Imanis original link below if youd like to read her complete story. There is also a fundraiser attached to that link. https://www.facebook.com/758942087501189/posts/3679227448805957/ ** Applications will not be screened if they do not meet the listed requirements.**",

I love when my people are around, but am also ok to stay at home alone for several hours. My hobbies are cuddling with my people (of course!), sleeping and playing - I love fetching tennis balls and chewing on my Kong toys! My foster parents also say I'm a real foodie and that I'm always happy to do Sit, Down or Stay in exchange for a treat. But who wouldn't do anything for cheddar, really? If you also like food or cuddling or playing...I'd love to meet you and hang out! I'm sure we'll be best friends in no time! \nCHECK OUT HER VIDEO ON YOUTUBE https://youtu.be/iOtn8z73SK8",

The adoption fee for Abuelo will be $150.\nAbuelo is a handsome, sweet 10 year old Chihuahua. He's the happiest guy around and loves to snuggle and wants to sleep with his owner. He gets a long fine with other dogs and prefers to hang out with them when not snuggling with his person. He is one of 5 senior Chihuahuas who were given up to a shelter when the owner moved so he's used to living in a pack of dogs. That doesn't mean he wouldn't love to be a spoiled only dog too though.\nAbuelo has had some trauma to his pelvis in the past, likely hit by car and his bones did not heal correctly. He has luxating patellas as well on both back legs so this gives him an very unusual gate. He gets around just fine though and loves to do his business in the yard then run as fast as he can back to his foster mom to be picked up and carried back inside. He is on a daily anti-inflammatory pill to keep him comfortable and will likely need that for the rest of his life.\nHe's very sweet and just wants a home of his own to live out his golden years. If you are interested in Abuelo, please complete our online application.",

            "description": "If you are looking for a best friend and constant companion, 7 year old Ella is your girl!!  Ella needs time and reassurance to feel comfortable in a new environment, but once she has time to learn and acclimate to a new household dynamic, she is a total snuggle bug who wants nothing more than to be an integral part of the family. Ella is cat friendly, seems to like other dogs who are respectful, and would do best in an adult only home or a home with children over 12 who are able to give her space until she's ready to accept their love. Ella did not know any commands when she came to Kodi\u2019s Club but has learned sit and is working on learning down in her foster home. Ella likes long walks, long cuddles, games of fetch with a large ball, belly rubs, boofing at the mailman, and food!!  To make Ella's transition from her foster home to her adoptive home, we will ask approved applicants to visit with her prior to taking her home.  If you think your home might be a good fit for Ella, you must complete the application on www.kodisclub.org.\n\n**If you are serious about adopting , you must head to our website at www.kodisclub.org and submit a completed application . We will not do anything without an app. Due to the small size of our volunteer-run rescue, only the approved adopter may be contacted. It is not first come first served, but the best match. Yes, if you are reading this, the dog is available so no need to check **",

Sadie is a spayed 18 month old, female pure bred Australian Red Heeler, and has had all her shots.\nWe are seeking a new home due to medical problems with us. Since we are older than 65, we are finding it difficult to keep her active and run properly.\nShe has had training and is house broken, mat broken and is gentle and loving yet needs to be run and exercised. She needs an ACTIVE family, and she is a country dog. A young family with kids with a farm would be perfect. She has been raised with an older cat and they play. She loves to play outside and children would be wonderful as long as they know how to treat a dog. She has been around a 10 year boy and responded favorably. She has not been raised with children or other dogs. When we have canine visitors all she wants to do is play.\nWe have several collars and a training collar, and an outside cage even though she sleeps inside. She is also a great guard dog.\nWe only want the best home possible for her. If you are interested, please call us on 304-456-4586 for an inspection or email us at axisdeeronthehill@outlook.com for a reply.\nWe live around the Dunmore area north or Marlinton WV.\nMichael and TanzeeVOLUNTEERS and DONATIONS NEEDED.

            "description": "DAKOTA came to us a few weeks ago from a shelter where he was an owner surrender. Initially he was very scared and nippy but we discovered much of this was due to his pain from dental issues and his eyesight which is compromised due to cataracts.  He had a much needed dental  and is now very much happier! He likes to go on walks and ride in the car too!  His ideal home would be as an only dog ( he does tolerate the other dog in his foster home though)\n\nDAKOTA is 12yrs old and weighs 12lbs.  He is not fond of being groomed, although he came to us in poor condition so his coat had to be shaved down.  He is now a much happier boy and will come to you to be pet and for belly rubs.  He needs an understanding family to go slowly with him until he learns to trust again. \nPomeranians are one of the longest living small dog breeds ,often living until 20yrs old!\n\nIf you would like to adopt this special  senior boy please go to our website www.somersetcottagepoodlerescue.org and click on adopt to download an adoption application \n\nDAKOTA'S adoption donation is $595 to help cover his large vetting expenses.",

            "description": "Scout #6941 is a handsome 3-year-old Lab mix. He is calm and sweet. His foster describes him as extremely well-mannered. Scout loves to lay on the couch and be lazy with his people. He is both crate and house trained. He is very strong on leash when he has to go potty, but once he has taken care of business he is more relaxed. We are working on leash etiquette. Scout knows the commands sit, stay, shake and walk. He is very attentive to commands and knows how to take treats gently. His favorite activities are watching the world go by out the window and sleeping. Out on walks, he loves to sniff everything. Scout loves to sit by the feet of his favorite person (especially with his tongue hanging out). He loves big comfy beds. He loves treats and food. He is good at meeting other dogs, but is food aggressive so if there is another dog in the home they MUST be fed separately; may be best as an only dog or with strict feeding rules. Scout does best with older children who understand boundaries, as he does not like people in his face. Scout rarely barks at all and is a very quiet young man. His favorite game is tug-of-war with a rope toy. Stuffed toys and Scout do not mix well - he will tear them up within minutes and make a big mess! His favorite time of day is the morning, so that he can greet you! He weighs 85 pounds and is full grown. This pup is microchipped. We believe you can always teach an \u2018old\u2019 dog new tricks, so we highly recommend continued obedience training for this smart pup; it stimulates the dog's mind and establishes a good dog/adopter relationship. This pup, like all pups, should be on heartworm preventative; an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. If you are interested in adopting this dog, and are already approved to adopt through our organization, please contact dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with the pup\u2019s name and ID number in the subject line. OTHERWISE, please submit an adoption application online: http://www.lastchanceanimalrescue.org/adoptus.html E-mail dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with questions.

            "description": "This handsome guy is Denver! He is a 6 year old mixed breed who weighs 80 pounds. Denver is happy, friendly, and goofy - but also super sweet. He loves going on walks and car rides, and will sit politely while being leashed. He is potty trained, though he may need a reminder after being at the shelter for a bit. Denver is a smart boy who knows sit and shake, and he happily takes treats gently.\n\nDenver likes other dogs, but is very overeager when meeting them for the first time. He immediately wants to play and doesn't have the best manners, so timid dogs would be overwhelmed by him. We're requesting no kids under the age of 9 in this big guy's furever home.\n\nIf you think Denver would be the pawfect addition to your family, please fill out an application to meet him! His minimum adoption fee is $275 plus a $12 fee, if 4 months or older, for rabies registration for McLean County residents. \n\nHe has been neutered, microchipped, vaccinated, heartworm checked, dewormed, and is on flea and heartworm preventatives.\n\nFor information about this dog's breed(s), visit: http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/abc.htm \n\nTo fill out our adoption application, go to: http://fs16.formsite.com/WishBoneCanineRescue/adoptionapplication/index.html",

            "description": "There are moments in rescue that you come across a dog that has experienced unfathomable cruelty.  Your heart breaks at the thought of what all she has experienced in her lifetime.  But she is a survivor - a sweet,  but shy girl who only wants to know love.  And love is what we shall find for her!\n\nThis beautiful survivor is Miley - a 7 year old Collie/Terrier mix who weighs 43.6 pounds.  She experienced extreme violence and trauma in her past life when a cruel human attacked her with a machete - causing the scar above her eye.  \n\nDespite this cruelty, Miley is a sweet girl who seeks love and attention from those she trusts.  She is shy, but loving and will require gentle guidance and patience in her new home.  We do believe that she will do best in a quieter home, with kids over the age of 13 years.  \n\nAfter spending a few days in a foster home, her foster family was able to share some new information with us about Miley.  They have found that Miley is more comfortable outdoors than in, especially while she's learning to trust.  Once she is familiar with her surroundings, she seems more inclined to stay close to her person, however she is a flight risk.  Miley requires a secure fenced yard and supervision during yard time.  As one can imagine, she can be pretty nervous about new situations and she will look to her person for encouragement.  She does enjoy walks, but a proper harness will be needed for the moments when she might be inclined to back away from a situation.  Miley takes great joy in chasing birds and squirrels - even if that means chasing them up a tree.  With this prey drive, small animals might not be a good fit. \n\nHer minimum adoption fee is $275 plus a $12 fee, if 4 months or older, for rabies registration for McLean County residents. She has been spayed, microchipped, vaccinated, heartworm checked, dewormed, and is on flea and heartworm preventatives.\n\nFor information about this dog's breed(s), visit: http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/abc.htm \n\nTo fill out our adoption application, go to: http://fs16.formsite.com/WishBoneCanineRescue/adoptionapplication/index.html",

He is very easy to walk and doesn't not need long walks or a large yard to run. He wants to be with his humans and enjoys relaxing and laying on a soft bed. He is great in a crate but doesn't want to chew on things at all. He is past the puppy stage for needing to train and just wants a calm relaxing place to spend his days. He did great with our cat when tests. He is ok around other dogs but prefers his space so would be best as an only dog.\n\nFor local adopters we offer a 2 week foster to adopt trial period to see if he is a good fit for your family.",

Thanks to all of our friends and the awesome doctors and staff at the vet, Angel was made healthy again.\n\nWe all love our girl, and we know there is an ideal forever home out there for her.\n\nThings that we know of Angel, are that she needs leash training. Her adopter will need to be dedicated to working with a trainer to make her the ideal walking partner and to get her  entree socialized around other animals. Currently she is not friendly around other animals.\n\nAngel LOVES to go for rides and hang out with her people. She loves people and  should be fine with older children, but due to size and unknown history, we are not comfortable placing her with young children in the home.\n\nA securely fenced yard where she can run and play safely, would be most ideal.\n\nFor more information, please call 860-428-4422",

            "description": "Meet Arthur! It seems like this silly boy is always smiling! He is a 2 year old Lab/Retriever mix who is medium sized at about 45 lbs. Arthur's foster family reports that he is a wonderful, polite houseguest with good manners and a sweet disposition. He enjoys exploring outside and playing with toys, especially stuffed animals, but is most happy when he is getting lots of pets! Arthur gets along fine with other dogs, but would do best in a home without cats. He does love to be the center of human attention, so Arthur would really enjoy easygoing doggie siblings who don't mind if he hogs the spotlight. With that big goofy grin, how can he not steal the show? Contact ARF to meet Arthur today!\n\n-----\nIMPORTANT: To protect the health of our staff and volunteers, ARF is currently conducting adoptions by appointment only. Please see more information below.\n\n-Contact Info: Have questions first about the adoption process or a particular animal? Please contact us at inquiries@animalrescuemobile.org.\n\n-Ready to Adopt? Please visit www.animalrescuemobile.org to submit an adoption application.\n\n-The Adoption Process:\nAn adoption application, veterinarian and/or personal reference, a home visit, and a $150 adoption fee are part of the process. All animals will be up to date on shots, microchipped, and spayed/neutered before adoption.\n\n-Please Note:\nSponsors are needed to help ARF with the cost of vet care. If you would like to sponsor an ARF rescue, please click the Sponsor Me button. A sponsor donation of $50 will help cover the cost of a spay/neuter surgery.

She absolutely loves to run and chase squirrels, so she would love a yard to play in, but she enjoys taking walks as well and with someone who could give her a minimum of two long walks each day she would be fine! Pearl is happy to spend the day playing with her toys and napping while her human works the day away!\n\nPearl is looking for an experienced owner who can work on training. For this reason, she would be best suited in a household without children or other pets.\n\nInterested in adding Pearl to your family? Apply online today!\n\nIf you are interested in adding this pup to your family, please submit an application at www.petrescuealliance.com. All questions will be answered and meet and greets set up following a review of application. If the dog is listed on our website or Petfinder, they are still available! Pet Rescue Alliance does our best to provide accurate information about the dogs we have available for adoption. We cannot make any guarantees about age, breed or temperament.",

He loves his toys and will jump high into the air to catch them, making \"fetch\" even more fun than usual. Everyone is very impressed with his skills and Ingalls always gets compliments from the caregivers and visitors for his serious handsomeness.

He is playful, affectionate and sweet. He is happiest when he can be adored by his fans. Bubu came to us from Macau, China and did not have a good early life. BuBu has lived in a couple of homes, but he needs to be the only dog in his home. He walks beautifully on leash and loves to go for walks. He is a good car rider. BuBu's adoption includes six training sessions with Crawford Canine Academy. BuBu would do best in a home with a securely fenced yard and no children.Sponsored by Robin Reich, in honor of David Ryan\nSponsored by Kierin Chase\nIf you would like to sponsor Bu Bu while he waits for his forever home, see: https://www.greyhoundpetsinc.org/support/sponsor-a-dog/\nGreyhound Pets, Inc. - www.greyhoundpetsinc.org - 877-468-7681\nWHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS TO ADOPT A GREYHOUND?\nRead Greyhound Pets, Inc.

For more information and the adoption application for Ollie, please visit our website belowhttp://www.coastalgsr.org/dog_profile.php?ID=22281&name=OllieOllie is a big and handsome White GSD whom we rescued from the shelter. He was originally picked up as a stray and adopted through the shelter, but, two years later, his adopter was moving and didnt consider Ollie in his plans, returning him to the same shelter from which he was adopted. When his time there ran short, we offered him a life vest and welcomed him into the Coastal family.This gorgeous boy didnt appear to have been socialized much with people, had horrible fly strikes on his ears, and is timid about life, in general, leading us to believe that he lived those two years in a yard and saw little else beyond the fence. Weve been working with him for a few months now and see that he needs help in trusting strangers and becoming more confident, so he will need a low traffic home with someone who believes in him and can show him life is fun and not scary! Around 3-4 years old, Ollie is a gem with the volunteers he knows and trusts, has honed his leash skills so much that he's now considered easy to walk, and is looking for someone to show him structure and give him leadership so that he can feel confident and comfortable in his new life. The minimum adoption donation for adults is $375 and the adoption donation for puppies is $500. This amount only partially covers the cost of veterinary care, boarding fees, and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs and is tax deductible. The adoption donation provides that all dogs will be spayed or neutered, receive current vaccinations, and are microchipped. If not, arrangements will be made on an individual basis ( i.e., puppies who will need to be altered by 6 mos old). Special consideration may be given to those willing to adopt older dogs or dogs with physical problems.",

We believe that Peaches will grow up to be about 50 lbs. This sweet, active girl is the life of the party. Smart as a whip, she loves playing with toys, is already crate trained and doing fantastic on her house training. Like any puppy, she will need a patient family who will provide her with training and exercise to help her grow into an amazing dog. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting Peaches, please visit our website www.rezqdogs.org/adopt to review our adoption policies and to fill out our adoption application.",

Beans loves to give them kisses, and occasionally inadvertently knocks over the 1 year old because Beans is not fully aware of his size. \nHouse Training Progress: No recent accidents\nCrate Training Progress: Does well in crate\nLocation: DC area foster\nRescued From: Smyth County, VA\nAdditional Information: Beans was found as a stray with his collar embedded into his neck. It has been removed and he has healed well. He is a friendly, gentle giant who is not only beautiful but is amazingly calm. Even when other dogs are barking at him and going nuts Beans just stays by his persons side and looks at the other dogs. The menacing household Roomba is a different story Beans does his best to protect the household from this marauding vacuum by barking at it. Beans has done well with the young children in his foster home, and doesnt try to chase them, even when they squeal and run away from his abundant kisses. Long walks are a favored pastime for Beans, who will thrive with an adopter who enjoys walking 2.5 - 3 miles a day. Beans is a smartie who knows the word sit, and he is looking forward to learning more tricks in his forever home.\n\n__________________________________\n\nIf you are interested in meeting a dog or cat, we require an adoption application. If the animal has \"HAS APPLICATION\" listed, they are still available to receive additional applications but also may be in the process of being adopted soon. Apply for a DOG: http://www.citydogsrescuedc.org/adoptable-dogs.html\n\nInterested in saving more lives? Foster a dog today! Learn more, see our list of dogs needing foster, and apply, https://www.citydogsrescuedc.org/foster-a-city-dog.html\n\nCity Dogs Rescue & City Kitties is a foster based rescue in Washington, DC. We do not have a shelter. We focus on local adoptions in DC and the metro area of Maryland and Virginia. CDR&CK has a thorough adoption process in order to find the best possible fit for each of our dogs and cats (we do not operate under a first-come, first served model).\n\nUpon accepting a new cat or dog into the organization, we provide a basic vet visit that includes necessary vaccinations, disease screenings, deworming, microchips, and spay/neuter (unless specified). We do not provide a comprehensive medical exam prior to adoption. As a result, sickness, injury, and disability may exist unbeknownst to CDR&CK. City Dogs Rescue & City Kitties is not responsible for payment of any vet care, including known and unknown medical conditions once a cat or dog is adopted from us. \nDog specific: Rabies, DHPP, Bordatella vaccines. They are tested for HW, Lyme, Ehrlichia, Anaplasmosis.\n\nMost cats and dogs will have a house training accident in the initial days in their new home and we cannot guarantee any pet is housebroken or crate trained.\n\nWe also update our Facebook page daily with new cats and dogs.",

After carefully getting her home and getting her checked at the vet, we found that this poor girl was suffering from a VERY painful pancreatitis and enlarged liver and an ulcer in her eye.  Plus, her teeth were an infected mess.  Her pancreatitis is resolved and she has had her dental work completed. Her ulcer is gone but she will need eye drops for dry eye for the rest of her life. \n\nSadie is a sweet girl, and hasn't shown any behavior issues since being home with her foster.  She timidly comes toward you and loves to have you rub her nose and back, and even shows you a little tummy now and again.  She loves walks, naps in her fluffy bed, and loves playing with her Westie sister.  She had come out of her shell, and is a real sweetheart.\n",

She adores and needs daily walks, but is also a fairly mellow girl. Patches is a quirky, but extremely loyal beauty. She is not used to being a city girl and does not know how to act around visitors, she would need someone to work with her on polite greetings. She would also do best in a home with kiddos 8+ years old and no cats. She loves to love her humans!\nhttps://www.lucky7dogrescue.com/applynow",

I\u2019m a goofy love bug with a zest for life - I love being a part of the family, shiny stuff, my food, treats and belly scratches! My foster family thinks I'm one of the sweetest dogs there ever was and is super excited for whoever decides to bring me into their life furever.\nI'm great with big hoomans (even ones I've never met) and little hoomans too (I lived with some of 'em, they were great!) I have excellent indoor manners and while I won't chew your things or break into your food, I'm always ready to cuddle up next to you on the couch and love going into my crate for a good night's sleep.\nI'm still getting used to being on the leash (but am doing better with my front harness) and would reallllllly appreciate getting to live with a hooman that can help me learn to contain my excitement when I see other dogs (though I love playing with them when I'm off leash!) I've never lived with a cat but don't chase them when I'm out (squirrels = different story!) \nI can climb a fence, so I require supervision outside (I am a doggo!) I don\u2019t need to stay outside though, because I\u2019m perfectly potty trained! I\u2019m also spayed, up to date on my shots, and currently finishing treatment for my heartworm. \nDo you have a place for me in your home and your heart?\n\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2020 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq",

He had been hit twice by cars and left on the side of the road for dead, for several days. Once someone realized he wasn't dead yet, a kind Samaritan took him to an animal hospital. She contacted rescues for financial assistance, and Bobby was given treatment for his injuries.  He walks on 4 legs with a little gimp, runs on 3 legs,  and is cross-eyed because he was untreated for so long.  NOW, he's pain-free, happy, and as healthy as can be.\nBobby is neutered and has his microchip.  He has all of his shots also.  \nBobby would like a home with someone that is retired or works from home permanently.  He would LOVE another dog, similarly aged, to play and live with. His adoption fee is $375. \nIf you are interested in meeting or possibly adopting Bobby the Lovebug, please email us at AdorableDogRescue@yahoo.com telling us a little bit about yourself, your home and yard, and the time that you will be able to commit to Bobby.\nBobby will go quickly because he is healthy (in spite of his leg and his eyes), and is very loving.  Bobby is so grateful for the help he received, and lives joyfully with the other dogs!! He needs to be picked up and petted, and loved on to become fully socialized. \nPlease email us as soon as possible with the info requested. We'll take down the profile as soon as he is adopted. Thank you!!",

I like to chase the ball, too, except I forget to bring it back. I am good on a leash plus I'm learning my manners and to go outside to potty. I can stay in a crate but I'd rather stay with my human.

I am a very sweet boy and I love to give and receive lots of love and attention. My favorite thing is to be outside and I love it so much that most of the time I don't even want to come back inside! A home with a fenced in yard where I could spend my time in the sunshine would make me just so happy. I've got the sweetest temperament and would be an excellent addition to any home whether it is with an experienced dog owner or with someone who is adopting for the very first time. I would just love the chance to show you how special I am and how much love I have to give!",

This we know because of the thousands of sun spots on his undercarriage.  He is super sweet his original name was Yeller. We contacted the original owners and they surrendered him verbally to us. He was examined by our trusted vet and diagnosed positive for Heartworms. The rescue started the expensive treatment with little funds and did not raise much for his care. We finished the treatment in November and still have an outstanding balance at the vet. He has been kept on heartworm prevention and he is happy and jolly boy. The last part of the treatment for him was a bit rough but he's a survivor. Now with a happy heart we can find this boy a well deserving home to keep him happy and healthy. He is very smart and appreciates the care and love given to him by me so it will be bitter sweet to see him go. My goal is to place him in the best home/environment/lifestyle/family possible. If interested to do a virtual meet and greet first. Contact Jessie by email : jessie@1luckydogrescue.com or text 786-486-4188. Thank you.",

With complete strangers he can be guarded, but it's his way of protecting himself.  He needs a special adopter who will take the time to visit multiple times before taking him home, to establish that relationship. He becomes an absolute amazing dog once he really gets to know you, but wants to make sure he trusts you before fully letting his guard down. With some patience, experience and lots of treats (LOVES chicken!), he will warm up quite quickly to you and his lab personality will shine. He thrives on a confident handler! Rolling in leaf piles is one of his favorite hobbies. He is a one of a kind dog. No small children or cats for this boy, A home without a dog is ideal but we would consider a very mellow canine companion with successful meet and greets. If you can give him the time and leadership he needs, please inquire about him!!",

He and his best friend Rambo have been together since they were tiny puppiestheir precious mom loved them more than anything. So sadly, this young woman became very ill and slipped into a coma with no hope of recovery and recently passed away. We're not sure how long she had been hospitalized and unable to care for the boys. There were no family members who could take Mojo and Rambo so they were surrendered to ATDR. We couldn't say no to these orphaned babies who have been sad and confused to the point of not eating well and losing some weight since their mom had to leave them. They're now in a loving foster home where they'll be cared for and nourished, physically and mentally, until they feel safe and hopefully secure again. Circumstances like Mojo and Rambo have experienced are very hard on pups who have never known anything but the love of an owner they totally adored.\nThese precious babies are bonded and for now having each other is the most security they feel. Rambo is fairly dependent on Mojo who comforts and sweetly watches over himboth pups are very sweet, friendly, playful, and well socialized. They came into rescue with a crate, a doggy bed, supplies and a garbage bag full of toysit's so obvious how much they were loved. ATDR is currently bringing their vetting up to date and then they'll be ready to go.\n12.19.20 Their foster mom reports: Mojo and Rambo want to wish everyone a very Merry Christmas! As seen by these precious little sweaters, their sweet mom apparently liked to dress them as twins...\nThese boys are good dogs. They go straight into their bed (crate) for a treat or whenever I open the laundry closet where the treats are kept. I feel comfortable leaving them free roaming in the kitchen when I'm working upstairs or when I go work out.\nThe boys are getting more playful and starting to show their true personalities. Mojo is a real card (does anybody use that saying anymore?). He loves to disembowel stuffed toys and tear apart indestructible toys, i.e. Kongs. The consensus is that Mojo looks like an Ewok from Star Wars but he could pass for a Wookie too, and since that is easier to say so I refer to him as 'The Wookie.' Mojo enjoys being loved on but he's a busy, independent boy, not needy, clingy or demanding of attention. When it comes to TV time, he prefers to lie on the other end of the same couch or even on the other couch. He doesn't lie by me (at least not yet). Rambo, on the other hand, likes to lay by me and get under the blanket. He's sweet and cuddly. He's not obsessed with destroying toys like his brother. Mojo is definitely the dominant of the two. He sometimes punks Rambo out of toys, food, etc. Rambo seems more dependent upon Mojo for a sense of security, but they are definitely bonded to each other. They lie in the same bed together frequently. If I separate them, e.g. for a bath, the one left behind will fuss. They're very precious cute boys!\nMojo and Rambo need to be adopted together. Won't you please consider giving both these boys another loving homehelping them become the secure happy pups they were before losing the person they were totally devoted to? If you would like to make their lives complete again, please fill out an adoption application. In no time at all they would love you more than you could ever imagine",

He and his best friend Mojo have been together since they were tiny puppiestheir precious mom loved them more than anything. So sadly, this young woman became very ill and slipped into a coma with no hope of recovery and recently passed away. We're not sure how long she had been hospitalized and unable to care for the boys. There were no family members who could take Rambo and Mojo so they were surrendered to ATDR. We couldn't say no to these orphaned babies who have been sad and confused to the point of not eating well and losing some weight since their mom had to leave them. They're now in a loving foster home where they'll be cared for and nourished, physically and mentally, until they feel safe and hopefully secure again. Circumstances like Rambo and Mojo have experienced are very hard on pups who have never known anything but the love of an owner they totally adored.\nThese precious babies are completely bonded and for now having each other is the most security they feel. Rambo is fairly dependent on Mojo who comforts and sweetly watches over himboth pups are very sweet, friendly, playful, and well socialized. They came into rescue with a crate, a doggy bed, supplies and a garbage bag full of toysit's so obvious how much they were loved. ATDR is currently bringing their vetting up to date and then they'll be ready to go.\n12.19.20 Their foster mom reports: Mojo and Rambo want to wish everyone a very Merry Christmas! As seen by these precious little sweaters, their sweet mom apparently liked to dress them as twins...\nThese boys are good dogs. They go straight into their bed (crate) for a treat or whenever I open the laundry closet where the treats are kept. I feel comfortable leaving them free roaming in the kitchen when I'm working upstairs or when I go work out.\nThe boys are getting more playful and starting to show their true personalities. Mojo is a real card (does anybody use that saying anymore?). He loves to disembowel stuffed toys and tear apart indestructible toys, i.e. Kongs. The consensus is that Mojo looks like an Ewok from Star Wars but he could pass for a Wookie too, and since that is easier to say so I refer to him as 'The Wookie.' Mojo enjoys being loved on but he's a busy, independent boy, not needy, clingy or demanding of attention. When it comes to TV time, he prefers to lie on the other end of the same couch or even on the other couch. He doesn't lie by me (at least not yet). Rambo, on the other hand, likes to lay by me and get under the blanket. He's sweet and cuddly. He's not obsessed with destroying toys like his brother. Mojo is definitely the dominant of the two. He sometimes punks Rambo out of toys, food, etc. Rambo seems more dependent upon Mojo for a sense of security, but they are definitely bonded to each other. They lie in the same bed together frequently. If I separate them, e.g. for a bath, the one left behind will fuss. They're very precious cute boys!\nRambo and Mojo need to be adopted together. Won't you please consider giving both these boys another loving homehelping them become the secure happy pups they were before losing the person they were totally devoted to? If you would like to make their lives complete again, please fill out an adoption application. In no time at all they would love you more than you could ever imagine",

            "description": "Snowbell was originally part of a hoarding situation in the Tulsa area. The lady turned many dogs over to local rescues, but was allowed to keep 4 dogs. Snowbell and Crackers were two of the dogs that she kept. Unfortunatly a year later she passed away. The dogs then found themselves at Tulsa Animal Welfare. A foster family took the chihuahuas in to get them out of the shelter. They then came here to ARF. Snowbell is still nervous, but is a sweet dog. Her and Crackers are bonded and we would love for them to be adopted together.\n\nFill out an application at the link below. Find the dog/cat you are interested in and click the adopt button. That will take you to an application. Once approved you will be called for an appointment to meet your possible new family member, or at that time you can meet the other animals as well. https://petstablished.com/public/search/shelter/301551\n\nAdoption fee is $150 which includes, spay/neuter, vaccines, etc, and a free 1 year membership to our 5 acre ARF Park. For other dog questions please email ARFdogs74006@gmail.com\n\nWe do adopt out of state, but the adopter must travel to ARF to meet the dog they are looking to adopt. They must have an approved application before traveling to meet the dog. We do allow small dogs that are eligible to fly in the cabin of a plane. We DO NOT allow dogs to travel in the cargo area of the plane under any circumstances. Any dog that is adopted can of course go by personal vehicle. We do not allow dogs to be transported \"pony express style\" where they are passed from driver to driver.",

He appears to be friendly and playful with other dogs with moderate energy levels. He is quite affectionate and playful once he develops a trusting relationship with you. Kibbles has shown sensitivity to touch around the collar/back of neck area. He can be wary of new people so we are asking potential adopters to commit to a series of meetings so he can get comfortable before going to a new home. He will probably be happiest in a home with another dog.If you'd like to meet him, please complete the application online at www.sarges.org and we'll contact you to set up the first meeting.",

He also loves being brushed. Jesse loves to go for car rides and walks and has nice leash manners.\n\nJesse is kennel trained and took no time at all to learn that his kennel is a good place where he eats and sleeps. He knows the word \"kennel\" and willingly goes in when asked to do so. Prior to rescue Jesse often went without food and shelter. For these reasons, he can get anxious about food. Jesse needs to eat in his kennel and hang out there when his people leave the house. He gets fed twice per day in his kennel and his favorite snack is a peanut butter dog cookie!\n \nJesse is completely housetrained and has never had an accident in the house. He knows to go to the door when he needs to go outside. Jesse loves to run around the yard to play and watch the neighborhood and park adjacent to our property. However, we discovered that he does not like the wild turkeys that come by or the excited neighbor dogs who run around off leash. So a 6ft fence is best for this big guy.\n \nHe gets along great with our cat and our other Pyr who is very calm. Jesse feels nervous around high-energy or anxious dogs. He will do best in a home with another calm dog or as an only dog. He does well with our 13 and 17 year old kids but the 4 year old neighbor boy makes him nervous so a home with older, calmer kids will be best. \n \nJesse is believed to be about 6 years old. He is neutered and up to date on all shots and heart worm negative.  Because of severe matting, 6 pounds of mats were shaved off Jesse before he came to NorthStar.\n \nJesse is not a trained stock guardian and will be placed as an indoor family pet only. An adoption application, secure visible fencing, a site visit, and an adoption fee are required to adopt Jesse.",

            "description": "Oreo is a male chi estimated to be about 2 years old. He weighs 8lbs and, as you can see, is colored just like an Oreo cookie!\u00a0\n\nOreo has a long story, and if you stick around long enough to hear it, you'll realize he's really worth it. Oreo is not a social, outgoing dog and never likely will be, but he's sweet and deserves a lot of love!\u00a0Oreo came from an irresponsible backyard breeder where he lived outdoors and had no socialization. \n\nHe came into rescue with a bad skin infection, and would defecate from fright if anyone came near. We had our work cut out for us, and as far as he has come, he still has a ways to go. He will get there one day, with the right family to love him. \n\nOreo has been in foster care for a year and a half. Foster mom and dad successfully weaned him from the corner he lived/hid in, and watched as he gradually integrated himself into the household. Small, tiny baby steps the entire way, \n\nOreo now freely roams the downstairs, timidly goes upstairs- but only for brief periods of time, and is trying his best to walk out the front door on his own to leash walk with the other dogs in the pack, but still isn't quite there yet as he finds the unfenced world a scary place.\u00a0\n\nHe freely goes outside in the fenced backyard, and will jump up on the couch to take a nap. His favorite place is a dog bed, the blanket on the couch, or in the backyard in the sunshine.\u00a0He is a creature of habit and does not like change. \n\nMoving to a new place will provide a whole new set of challenges for him, but with patience and dedication, he will succeed.\u00a0We've lived with the same routine for a long time and he's done well with it. \n\nHe is very food motivated, but also very stubborn. He is still learning to accept gentle touches and would do really well with someone who has time to dedicate to work with him. Each night he jumps up to snuggle with Foster mom, and as simple as that sounds, that's a really big deal!\u00a0\n\nHe is now crate trained and sleeps nightly in his crate.\u00a0 He gets up in the morning and wags his tail and is really excited for his day! As for potty training, he teeters on the threshold of knowing he needs to go outside to go potty, but has a spot inside (where he used to live) that he tends to go (Foster mom leaves a pee pad there) and pees on it regularly.\u00a0\n\nHe is a flight risk- a large one. He's very frightful of loud sounds, new people, and needs a very, very patient family. It's taken him a long time to do normal dog behaviors that most people take for granted, in fact foster mom has only just now been able to pick him up and hold him without him trying to flee. Simple things are very large for Oreo.\u00a0\n\nOreo doesn't like new people and would not be a good fit for small children. Oreo has taken pride in his foster home and feels he needs to protect it, he barks at all visitors and sometimes nips their ankles even!\u00a0\n\nFoster mom and Dad feel he's come far enough to move to a dedicated home who is looking to successfully help him integrate and live a life of luxury. \n\nOreo would do best in a home with small dogs. He loves to play, and he does really well following the pack. He would likely not do well as a single dog in a new place.\u00a0The only car rides Oreo goes on is to the Vet. He is frightened but seems to do better each visit. \n\nOreo will come to you when called, if treats are involved, or he knows it's meal time. Otherwise, he generally needs a lot of coaxing and would need someone to understand it will take him a while to understand a new routine.\u00a0\n\nEvery milestone he reaches is a cause for celebration. He has more to meet, and his new home should understand the time it will take for him to trust, and that he will not make new people best friends easily.\u00a0\n\nHe is neutered, UTD on shots, HW neg and on HW prevention.\n\nHis adoption donation is $250.00.\n\nIf you are interested in the above dog, please do not email us and tell us that you are interested, but submit an adoption application. The link for the application is below.\n\nTo submit an application go here\u2026\u2026chihuahua-rescue.com/adoption-application/\nAn application must be submitted and approved before a meet-n-greet can be scheduled.\n\nYour current dogs/cats must be spayed or neutered unless a veterinarian has determined that your current pet(s) should not be fixed due to medical reasons. \n\nThey must also be up-to-date on shots and on HW preventative.Reference checks and a home visit are required so SE dogs can only be adopted in NC/SC, VA, TN, AL, MD and GA.",

We learned that he does know some commands and he is very smart! If you are interested in Tru Blue, please research the breed. Cattle dogs are herding dogs and must with an active family. They are very loyal and wonderful dogs, but they just aren't for everyone. Tru Blue weighs 47 pounds and his date of birth is 10/11/2018.\n\nYou can submit an adoption application for this handsome boy at http://www.fayettefcar.com/applicationform, where you can also review FCAR\u2019s adoption requirements.\n\nAll FCAR adoptable dogs have been spayed or neutered, are current on all vaccines, on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, microchipped, and come with a 30-day pet health guarantee. The adoption fee is $95 with an approved application. A fenced yard is required for Tru Blue.",

I'm very timid of new people so please be patient with me. I was rescued in the spring of 2020 but was really scared and got away from my foster. After a few months this nice lady found me a hundred miles away where I was lost. I was really happy to start my new life; I learned all about living inside a home and being around people. I like to keep an eye on everything - I'm on alert most of the time. My foster family is pretty ok; they give me food and treats and keep me safe. I've even started curling up at my foster dad's feet while he watches tv, and a couple of times I've rested my head on his lap. I'm a sweet boy who just needs a calm, patient family to love... could that be you?\n\nCompatibility:\nDogs: Yes\nCats: Yes\nKids: 13+ only\n\nThe Basics:\nHouse broken: Yes\nCrate trained: Yes",

They were kept separated during their stay at Animal Control which left them heart broken, Not understanding why they were all alone. Left behind by the only family they had known, not even able to take comfort in each other as they've always done. When someone from Animal control reached out to C.A.R.E. we knew we had to do something to give them hope.  \n\nWe gladly welcomed both Kharma and Lucky into the C.A.R.E. Family. It was such a happy moment to witness them being reunited upon their arrival, At that moment we made them a promise.. We promised to find them a loving and devoted home where they could stay together forever!  \n\nLucky is a 9 year old white male American Pitbull terrier mix. Kharma is a 5 year old brindle female American Pitbull Terrier mix. Losing their lifelong family was very hard for them but a brighter future awaits them! They are currently at the C.A.R.E. Sanctuary enjoying some much needed TLC while awaiting the perfect family to welcome them into their lives and home.

You don't need to email asking if they are available. \nThe crucial first step is to fill out an application @www.camorescue.com\n\nBuddy is a 1-2 year old, 10 lb. chihuahua looking for some warmth and cuddles. A little playtime with some buddies around his size wouldn't hurt either. Once bonded  with his human He is right there by their side. Buddy will follow you around or pop himself onto your lap, he will sleep by your side and burrow under the covers.  And when you come home from work he is so excited to see you that he will wrap his legs around you.  Buddy is potty trained and crate trained! \n\nALL adoptions require a completed application, vet check, home check and final contract.  The application to adopt can be found at www.camorescue.com.\n\nAdoption fees are variable. Up to date vaccines, microchip, spay/neuter are included in the fee.\n\nOnce your application has been approved, we will put you in touch with the foster to set up a  meet and greet. We are a foster based RESCUE, not a shelter. All of our dogs are in individual foster homes. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We select the best applicant for each dog, based on the dog's needs. \nFor the safety of our small breed dogs and based on our past experiences, we will not place our dogs in homes with large breed dogs.    \n\nCAMO rescue is a 501c3 whose primary focus is rescuing small dogs from the euthanasia list from high kill TX shelters.   \nEIN # is 46-5486022\nWe rescue 800+ animals a year.\n\nFollow us on Facebook at www.facebook.com/camorescue\n\nOur donation link is http://www.paypalme/camorescue \n\nWe are strictly volunteer based, no salaries are paid and 100% of donations go towards rescuing dogs.",

            "description": "Poor Wilbur was left behind when his family moved!! He had been an outside dog along with an overbreed female who got adopted, now he is waiting for his furever family. He lived with 3 boys ages 8-11, and loves to sit with his people. He does need to be the only dog as his only furry friend is no longer around. He walks well on a leash and truly loves going for walks but does have a high prey drive. He doesn't mind his crate and is NOT a chewer. Wilbur likes routine and structure and responds very well to discipline. He likes to sleep on his dog bed in the same room as his person. He loves everyone he meets and is also a sunbather.

So the kind nurses reached out to us and naturally we said YES! What we know about Elka is she loves to run and play in her big backyard with her foster brother, she loves her toys but she doesn't like the dominate female in the house playing with them so she would do best in a home with a submissive male dog. She is house trained and doesn't seem to be a chewer. She is around 3 years old and 58 lbs. She needs a home without a lot of activity and people. She does best with only 1 or 2 humans in the home. Older kids only!!!\n\nAll of our Wigglers are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, hw tested/treated, and on preventatives. We require proof spanning 2 consistent years of HW preventatives for already owned pets, UTD on shots, and spay/neuter in order to adopt. Please read their description above closely. Our adoption fee is $350. For an application to foster or adopt send us your number and email address in a message. *",

            "description": "Shelby is a gray and white 3 year old pittie mix that weighs in around 70 lbs. She has the most beautiful eyeliner and a wiggly body just made for snuggling.\n\nShelby comes off a bit shy when you first meet her, but once she opens up, let the kisses and pets begin! She loves snuggling with her humans and is happy to just chill by your side all day long. She is a great home office dog, and is pretty low energy. Even on days when weather doesn\u2019t permit a long or good walk, she is content to just curl up and nap with you or at your feet. She LOVES to give kisses.\n\nShelby has a lot of dog school under her belt that makes her a well-behaved pup. She does, however, prefer to be the only dog in the home. Shelby was adopted into a family through PFP and was recently returned to our rescue after the family realized she did not get along with their resident dog, even after training and time. She does enjoy going on pack walks and occasionally running the fence with neighbor dogs, but she would be a best fit in a home as the only resident dog. She also needs a cat-free home and a home with older kids or adults only. \n\nShelby is crate trained and very trustworthy. Her foster family has never had to worry about her destroying things or climbing on furniture. She currently lives alongside a live Christmas tree and barely touches it or looks at it. Her tail on the other hand\u2026 that\u2019s her most powerful weapon! Silver lining is, that\u2019s how she shows her happiness \u2013 with her tail and her whole body. So you know she\u2019s always a happy girl!\n\nIf you\u2019d like to meet Shelby, please visit www.playersforpits.com/adoption-survey today!",

He is safe in Austin now and showing us what a playful guy he is! Elf loves his toys (to either play with by himself or with his foster parents), will always lean in for pets, and adores his people! He'd be happy as the only dog or would also love a doggy playmate who will match his high energy play style. Because of Elf's energy level and play style, we feel he'd do best in a home with older kids. Elf would love to continue his training in basic obedience so he can blossom into the dog we know he can be!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this sweet boy, please contact adopt@love-a-bull.org",

            "description": "Dixie Belle is a beautiful English Springer Spaniel mix, about 10 years old and 37 lbs. She\u2019s a gentle, sweet & loving dog that loves all the cuddles she can get! Her favorite spot is on your lap where she can completely relax with you. She has a big appetite and sleeps easily through the night. This lil' lady loves being around people and is very quiet and laid back. Dixie Belle is housetrained, walks well on the leash, and is well past her puppy stage.  She is great with other dogs and cats and is a very easy going girl.  This poor angel was rescued out of a pond and had a very difficult life before coming into our care.  She will light up your world instantly!\n\nDixie Belle is blind and deaf but gets around pretty well.  She does have elbow dysplasia and arthritis, so she is in need of an adult home and extra care such as guiding her outside and picking her up on staircases.  This special girl deserves only the best, so we are looking for a special home for her to spend the rest of her life being spoiled like the princess she is.  \n\n\nThank you so much for your interest in adopting a dog from A New Chance Animal Rescue (https://anewchancear.org). We are a 501c3, tax deductible organization. ANCAR is a foster-based rescue, and we adopt within a 90 mile radius of Bedford Hills, NY.  You will find the adoption application here: (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-application/).  All fields on the application must be completed.\nPlease read about the adoption process (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-process/) so you'll know what to expect when you submit.   \n\nOur dogs are in foster care and we do NOT have a shelter or boarding facility. AN APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED IN FULL AND APPROVED BEFORE A DOG CAN BE MET. This is a firm policy. Our busy volunteers are not able to respond to questions about the dog or dog meeting requests in the absence of an application.  We know these dogs very well because they are in foster care. Please read the profiles of the dog(s) you are interested in prior to submitting an application.  If there are specific requirements stated (ie: Fenced Yard or Canine Friend Required) these are included because they are vital to the happiness, health, safety and adoption success of that dog. \n\nWe are only able to save as many dogs as we have foster homes (https://anewchancear.org/foster/faqs/) and resources for. We provide medical care including vaccinations, testing, deworming, spaying/neutering and microchipping before transporting our dogs. We provide all supplies, preventatives and any follow up vet care necessary while they are in foster care. These costs are high and the number of lives we can save is entirely dependent upon donations from people like you.  We do not receive funding from private foundations or government sources. If you can find room in your heart to help us, with any amount, we are truly grateful (https://anewchancear.org/help/donate/). We are a 501c3 organization, so all donations are tax-deductible. It is only through the kindness of supporters like you that we are 'changing lives...one tail at a time' by providing our dogs with 'A New Chance.' (https://anewchancear.org) \n\nThanks so much.",

She is still pretty protective over her puppies but other than that is doing great. \n\nWe were told she is a Lab Mix but we believe she may have some Terrier in her because she does have some sections of her coat that look Terrier.  She isn't very big at about 35 lbs.\n\nWe were told that prior to having puppies she was good with other dogs - since she is still nursing we haven't yet attempted her with another dog here at the shelter.\n\nShe certainly appears to be housebroken.\n\nShe should be ready for her very own home the first week of January 2021.  Her adoption fee will be $250.00.  She will be spayed, current on shots, wormed, heartworm negative and micro-chipped.\n\nAn application to adopt is mandatory and must be tentatively approved to even visit the shelter.  To fill that out go to OUR website at www.patriotsforpets.com and you will find the application under the Adoption tab..",

He has had the surgery and is recovering well.  Zeus is a loveable guy that can't wait until he is fully recovered to get back to playing fetch.  He has been so patient during his rehab.  Won't you come adopt Zeus so he can recover the rest of the way in a nice warm home?\n\nZeus is current on shots, licensed and microchipped. All dogs over 6 months have been heartworm tested, and all dogs are treated monthly for fleas/ticks (Nexgard or Frontline Gold) and are on Heartworm prevention (Heartgard Plus). All pets are spayed/neutered prior to adoption. All our dogs are temperament tested and \"should\" like dogs, cats, and kids unless noted. WE HAVE MORE PETS IN THE SHELTER THAT ARE NOT ON PETFINDER. Call with the pet's name and ID if you have questions on this pet. Save time, print out and bring our Pre-Adoption Form.",

But don't let his size fool you, he is really very sweet. He's big mush who loves his people. He is dog selective, so we suggest he be the dog only in the home. Cats are unknown. Due to his size, we recommend no young children. He prefers a yard so he can run and play. He loves his down time too and will make a great tv buddy or book reading pal. He loves walks but is fine just playing in his own yard as well. Spencer is neutered; fully vetted.\n\nPlease contact nypeticare@aol.com",

            "description": "Meet Incubus, an eleven-month-old American Pit Bull Terrier mix.\n\nIncubus is a handsome boy who loves people, he gets super excited when he meets people and is all over them in his excitement, because of this it might be best he goes to a home with no young children who might accidentally get knocked over. He has never met a stranger in his life and loves treats \"sitting\" for them. Incubus also enjoys playing with squeaky toys and just being a big goober, he currently weighs 50 pounds. When he really wants a treat he will talk to you with big, low woofs that will melt your heart. Incubus has met the YHS house cat.  He is very excitable around cats and will chase them, and due to his behavior he cannot be in a home with cats.\nUpdate* Sadly Incubus was returned again due to his higher energy level.  He will do best in a home that is active and has a large fenced in yard.  Incubus is still very puppy and tends to be mouthy and jump up on people.  He will need an experienced adopter that is comfortable training a large dog.\nUpdate* Incubus was adopted but had to be returned due to him jumping up on the adopter's senior mother. He is a very active and happy boy who needs a similarly active adopter who wants to help him with his training. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting this pet please fill out an adoption questionnaire at www.yakimahumane.org. A Yakima Humane Society staff member will contact you once your questionnaire has been received.\n\nIf you would like to adopt this pet you can fill out an online adoption form at www.yakimahumane.org. Please give the name and ID number for the animal you wish to adopt.\nIf you are thinking about adding a pet to your family, be a hero, please consider adopting a shelter pet and if you already have pets \u2013 for life\u2019s sake \u2013 spay and neuter. Spaying and neutering your pets is the single most important thing you can do to help decrease our nations severe pet overpopulation.\n*NOTE: Nearly 90% of the animals that come into our shelter are abandoned, neglected, traumatized, injured, or ill. We attempt to give our best assessment of the animal\u2019s welfare and temperament. Unfortunately, due to lack of funding, volunteers, and resources our physical and mental assessment of the animal is not always 100% correct.",

Cabezon is Staffie / Pit Bull mix, H/W negative, fixed, and received all his adult shots including rabies on 8/17/20. \n\nHis backstory is that he was wandering on our street one Sunday, hung out with us all day and then took off. My husband spotted him on his way home the next day with a homeless man. It was clear he had been attacked by another dog and was in need of some vet attention. The homeless man told Miguel he could no longer care for him and asked that he take him. The dog was seen by our family vet that day and again later that week. We later named him Cabezon, big head and hard head in Spanish :) We thought we had some potential adoptions lined up on our own but we are now happy to have Pup Squad help us find a good, responsible home for him. \n\nHe's a great dog that loves hanging out with other dogs and people, but not cats. He's a large, strong dog and needs an owner that can handle a dog his size with a yard for him to run around and play because he loves toys and tug-of-war. Being an ex-street dog, in the beginning he would try to leave and jumped our short 4 foot fence with ease. He doesn't anymore but a tall fence is definitely a requirement for any potential adopter. He is crate trained, does well on a leash, and we're still working on other basic commands. He's super friendly and just really sweet natured despite his tough appearance!\n\nOur adoption fee is a $250.00 donation to Pup Squad Animal Rescue. Our adopted dogs are all spayed/neutered, vaccinated and micro-chipped. If you are interested in adoption, please go to www.pupsquad.org/adopt to read more about our policies and find our application.

He is vaccinated, neutered, microchipped and dewormed.\n\n There is a dog in his foster home and they get along fine. He has a real easy personality so I think he would get along with any dog friendly dog. He's never been with cats. He would do good with kids but does jump so no toddlers.\n\n He has been crate trained and potty trained.\n\n If you\u2019re interested in adopting him get preapproved by completing an application at pawsforlifespringfield.org\n\nWe adopt in Sangamon County in Illinois and bordering counties only",

Ynonna enjoys playing outside with other dogs and loves receiving affection from people.\n\nShe weighs 55 pounds full-grown, and we believe she is a German Shepherd mix. \n\nYnonna would make a great fit into a loving and caring family! Wouldn\u2019t you like to have this sweet girl in your life?\n\nAll of our dogs are spayed or neutered and are current on all vaccinations. They are on monthly heartworm and flea/tick prevention. All of their medical needs are taken care of before they are available for adoption. Our adoption fee is only $100.00. Please complete an application, if you have found a dog you are interested in adopting. You can find our application at www.horsecreekwildlife.org/applic.html. Once completed, you can forward it to adoptions@horsecreekwildlife.org or fax it to 731-926-3000. Kim Austin, our adoption facilitator, will be in contact with you as soon as she has an opportunity to review your application. Understand that she has other duties and she will not ignore any interest shown in adopting one of our dogs. An application will need to be approved before a scheduled time to visit our dogs will be set up.  It may take up to 48 hours before she returns your call or responds to your email, due to work schedules, holidays and adoption events. We do the very best we can for the dogs we have rescued and do not take the adoption process lightly. Please be patient and understand that we will place our rescued dogs in the very best homes possible and reserve the right to refuse applications.",

I was safe, dry, and warm!  We waited my allotted time and now I am officially up for adoption.  I have all of my vaccinations, I am heartworm negative, I have a microchip, and I have been neutered.  I am a happy-go-lucky boy that would be a wonderful new family member! Do you have room in your home for me?",

Submit an application from our website and then make an appointment to meet him.\n\nCaesar is not eligible for foster and will be a straight adoption.\n\nAge: ~7 years\nWeight: ~79lbs\nHousebroken: Yes\nCrate trained: Working on it! Takes some time to settle (10-30 minutes) but has done well both in a crate and when sectioned to a confined area (bedroom). \nDog sociability: Friendly with dogs on walks! He's a big boy and pull towards dogs to say 'hi!!' as he is very playful. Will benefit from a confident handler.\nCat sociability: Unknown\nKids: Unknown, but he can be mouthy (play bites) when overly excited so best suited for older kids/teenagers\nIdeal home: Caesar is looking for an active adopter that can continue to work on training! He is not a match for a high-rise/elevator building but is adaptable to most other living environments! \n\nPizza! Pizza! There's nothing Little about this Caesar! This gentle giant will have you wrapped around his paws as soon as you see those giant puppy-dog eyes and adorable ears. A very sweet and loyal dog, Caesar is the best! He is a playful and active pup, so don't let his age fool you! His online dating profile would read that he loves long walks, is an avid runner, and enjoys nothing else more than to rest his big ol' head on your lap during snuggles. Caesar is doing well with his training and has great basic commands. This is an incredibly sweet pup who even put up with being squeezed into a holiday sweater that just barely fit over that adorably large noggin! He also loves to carry his stuffed toys on walks which might be the cutest thing we'eve ever laid eyes on. After one play sesh, this Caesar is guaranteed to Veni, Vidi, Vici your heart!\n\nDue to a generous donation, Caesar's adoption fee is now sponsored. He is neutered, up to date on core vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative. He will require booster vaccines at the adopter's expense. \n\n***We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications. We ask that you please be patient and someone will be in touch via email within 72 hours. Please do not email us unless you have not received a response in 72 hours.

Rosalia is a very energetic youngster who hasn't had much training in her past and will need an adopter ready to give her a structured routine with lots of physical and mental exercise. She adores people and is very sweet, but when she gets excited she can get very jumpy and play-bite for attention. She needs to learn boundaries and have a consistent outlet for her energy. Rosalia is a smart gal who will be very happy with the right home! We will consider only very experienced dog handlers for Rosalia. She would also do best in a home without children. Approved adopters interested in her can email adopt@heartsandbonesrescue.com for more info. If you're not approved yet apply today!",

Hennie is housebroken and crate trained. She is also spayed, up to date on vaccines, and will be fully vetted before adoption! \n\nFrom what we know/understand about Hennie\u2019s past she has not lived an easy life. She has had multiple litters of puppies, likely has lived as on outdoor dog, and hasn\u2019t been given the love and attention she deserves. That ended for her thanks to her amazing foster mama! Hennie deserves the spoiled life of a loved companion and to live life as an indoor dog. Hennie is on the shy side and takes some time to warm up to knew people, but we know with the perfect home she will flourish and show her amazing personality. Her new family will need to understand it may take a little bit for her to warm up. Hennie is beginning to hangout on the dog beds, chew bones, following her foster mom around and attempting to play with her furry foster siblings. She would thrive with another social/playful dog in the home. \n\nTo adopt Hennie fill out our adoption application online at the link below\nwww.bullluvablepaws.org/adopt\n",

Zoomies around the backyard are his favorite, as well as a good game of tug of war.\n\nHe also likes to cuddle and will make himself as small as possible to fit in your lap. He watches TV and will do the cute headtilt, as he is actively listening. \n\nHe is doing well with potty training and will go to the backdoor and ring the bell when he wants to go out. Sometimes he still forgets when he is playing hard. He sleeps through the night in his kennel and goes in without any problems. \n\n \n\n*Homeownership Required! Possible BSL.\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

            "description": "Noel is the perfect work from home companion who is very happy to hang out at your feet all day. She won't bother you for more than a little attention and a walk, and she may snore audibly during your afternoon zoom call, but it is very cute. She is crate trained and very comfortable hanging out in there, but she doesn't need the crate, just a safe place to mellow out for the first few days that she's with new people. \n\nShe is very friendly with most dogs, and is happy to play with her foster brother for a little while. She recently had puppies, and is getting back to her ideal shape, so after enough training with her foster brother she will be ready for hiking season this summer. Noel is a little more hesitant in warming up to people, and warms to females a little quicker. Once she knows you, she will be happy getting as much attention from you as you will give her. She is house trained, walks great on a leash, and is working on new skills. \n\n*Homeownership Required! Subject to BSL.\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

            "description": "Talk about a unique boy! Donovan will be the talk of the town with his adorable nose speckles! This super friendly guy showed up at our shelter as a stray. He has been charming our volunteers and staff ever since! Donovan is full of energy and always ready for any kind of shelter activities. He loves to go for walks and zoom around our play yard in his free time. Donovan would thrive with an active adopter that is looking for a new sidekick. Donovan was friendly with other dogs when introduced, but would likely need a slow introduction to other dogs in the home. He ignored cats, but will need monitored with them to be sure he isn't going to turn into a kitty chaser. We think Donovan would do best in a home with older children due to his size and energy level. Donovan is waiting to meet you, get your application in today!\n\nIf you're interested in meeting or adopting Donovan, please complete an application at: inapl.org/adoption-application. Once it's processed, a member of our team will be in touch with you to schedule a meet and greet appointment. This is the time when you and all members of your household will come to our shelter to officially make your connection with Donovan.\n\nDonovan\nPit Bull Terrier mix\nMale\nDOB: 12/8/2018\nWeight: 62 lbs.\nHeartworm Negative",

His front leg was hurt which is probably part of the reason he has gained weight.  He limps slightly on that leg and we are unsure of the outcome of the injury.  He is walking on it.

            "description": "Oreo is super fun, sweet and lovable. She is only 10 months old. Like all young pups, she is active and playful and will keep you on your toes. Oreo loves to go on adventure outings with our staff and volunteers. Hiking, long walks in the park, taking rides in the car, hanging out with human friends and playing are her favorite things to do. Oreo knows some basic obedience skills and is already house trained. She is working on her patience and manners. She can get over-exuberant when she wants to play so she will need your help with structure so she doesn't get over excited! Reward-based training is best. She is eager to learn and treat motivated. Oreo loves enrichment and chew toys and to play, play, play. If you are looking for an outgoing, social, love bug who will keep you motivated to exercise then head over to our Eastside Shelter to adopt Oreo. Weight: 62 lbs Housetrained: yes Dogs: meet and greet, would need management and a well matched doggy companion Cats: unknown, never been around Children: recommend kids over 12 due to strength, over-exuberance and mouthy-ness when playing",

You can apply online by clicking on Application .\nPuppies that are under 4 months old cannot be adopted outside of our Veterinary Service area. Please call for specific locations. Children under 8 years old often are not a good match for our puppies and dogs. In order to protect both, your child and our rescued dogs/puppies from harm, we seldom if ever adopt to families with young children.\nOnce your application is approved, we will schedule a meet and greet at one of our adoption events. Thank you for considering a rescue! The adoption fee includes vaccinations, Bordetella, de-worming, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip. There is a an additional $12.99 fee for Home Again for a lifetime registration of the microchip.\nPuppies cannot be adopted outside of the Houston area until they are spay/neutered after they are 4 months old. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.\nNOTE: In our bios, we provide information based on our volunteer's experience with a particular dog; such as temperament, training, and ability to get along with others.\nAARF is a 501(c)3 Non Profit, all breed, no kill organization. Our group is always in need of donations in order to continue to give the needed medical care to our rescues. Adoption fees do not begin to cover all of the medical costs. Any donation , no matter how small is a big help and is greatly appreciated. Please help us to continue to help them. Thank you.",

A skilled leash walker, Teddy constantly looks to his handler for direction and guidance. He has spent weeks and weeks waiting for someone to choose him. It's only natural that he gets so excited for the attention when volunteers walk him. Teddy responds well to correction and direction and behaves as a loyal companion when he spends time with volunteers at the shelter. A great snuggler, Teddy's ideal home would be with a single person or small family who wants Teddy as their loyal companion. If you are an experienced dog owner with no other pets who wants Teddy as your loyal companion, please email us to apply! Adoption fee $100.\nTeddy is HW+, but we can talk about treatment options.",

Well maybe now that I'm in Dawg Squad I'll be able to shed a few pounds and get back to my girlish figure!\n\nYes, Miss Wanda is a tad overweight but that just makes her all the more lovable.   We like to call it Rubenesque.\n\nShe is a very calm dog who can be hesitant when she first meets you.   She warms up quickly and appreciates a good snuggle.   Wanda is very gentle and tolerant of other dogs.\n\nShe does need some leash work but is very willing to please.    Is food oriented and will be easy to train.   \n\nOur Founder is kinda in love with this dog.    She's just so \"squishy\"!\n\nhttps://dawgsquad.org/adoption-application/",

These two showed up together at a shelter and are total besties for the resties, so much so that they need to go to a home together. Jack is currently recovering from HW treatment while Jill is recovering from spay in their foster home. Both Jack and Jill can be picky about dog buddies, so it's probably best they go to a home without other dogs. When together, they are a calm, laid-back duo that just want to snuggle up in your lap. These two are perfectly crate trained and are working on potty training in their foster home. If you are looking for the perfect pack, look no further than Jack and Jill! \n",

I am good at listening to commands. I know sit, stay, down, come and no!  I know you are loving me because I am so smart. Let me share some more about myself- I am potty trained, so I will not ruin Grandma\u2019s antique rug you might have. I do good  with a doggie door as well. If I am not let out, I could have the occasional accident, I can\u2019t hold It for long times. My favorite part of the day is with my owner when I get belly rubs, rubs behind the ear (this makes me doze off) and when we get to cuddle. I will also be your companion for watching TV. I love movies, sports, and HGTV. Anything you watch, I love to watch too!  Sometimes I do get skittish with strange noises, so be patient with me in your home until I learn those sounds, and I may give the occasional bark. I get along great with other dogs, I just need some time to to get to know them. I am not sure about cats, I have not been around them. I am leash trained, and love walks at sunrise or sunset  I do not like being confined in the crate- I am so good on my own, that I do not need to be in a crate. I get scared being locked up. I also do not like being an outside dog- being inside is my favorite- please do not put me outside with a dog house. I am a very smart and beautiful girl and I am looking for my fur- ever home. \n\nWe have a family of Sheppards! Mommy sky is about 1-2 years old. She had a little of 6 babies. We have the daddy also! Shaggy(adopted)They are both amazing dogs. The mom and babies are ore adoption only. We are taking applications to start the process but will not be available to go to their new home until babies are winged. But they will find homes quick so put your application in!",

            "description": "This is Sasha! Female. 42.2lbs. Very young/puppy like in behavior. Friendly, but still skittish if anyone moves to quickly, but once she knows shes in good hands she does wonderfully. We know she's been mistreated. Approx 8-9 months old, a stray female, Lab mix that wandered up on a property.\n\nShe runs like a gazelle. But she also calms down very easily. She's not hyper at all. She plays when it's time to play them come in and will settle down. She loves to give out kisses. She does well with other dogs and not right for cats. Alone, she would be wanting more attention and would require a stay-at-home or work-from-home individual.\n\nShe is learning manners and is housebroken. She will stand at the backdoor then look back at her human when she has to go. She is not good on a leash, but the foster is working with her to get used to one. She is crate trained. And prefers to be in it only for short periods. She will lay inside one, at times, with the door open. She is still puppy and will chew, but given a chew toy and other toys. She's easily corrected and redirected. Very eager to please and very smart and she knows how to open a door if it's not shut all the way.\n\nShe seems good with big dogs and dogs that are 20lbs & active. Sasha would thrive in a home with one or more dogs. She will require a private fenced in yard. She's active, playful, enjoys playing with a couple of other dogs, and will attach to her human quickly. She still needs a moment to trust people, but then she wants to be with them everywhere. This is why she needs a home with one or more dogs., so she gets to play & learn more about being a dog. Sasha understands the pack rules, never snaps back when others snap at her. She has no aggression, and is submissive.\n\nIf you are interested in giving a home to Sasha please go complete our online pre-adoption application http://www.southernskiesrescue.org/adoption-application\n\nSasha is fully medically vetted; spayed, up-to-date on prevention plus will be microchipped before going to her forever home.",

            "description": "Adopter must be from the Denver area and have a fenced yard. Hunter, who is 5 yrs old, will need a few gradually increased visits in the potential adoptive home prior to adoption. Hunter is a dog with a lot to teach humans. He needs a family with experienced dog owners who have the patience and skills to look, listen, and learn. He has taught me that he can be ok with both men and women if they allow him to be slow and to have time to really gather his senses and access a new situation. Because Hunter is timid, he does not like to be reached for or approached suddenly and might try to bite if he is approached in this manner. He needs to know what is going to happen before it happens. We can only guess what happened to Hunter is his past to have instilled some fears. Since he came to my foster home, I have witnessed Hunter go from cautious, apprehensive, insecure, and protective to calm, trusting, gentle and relaxed - as long as he understands what is going to happen. Hunter will bark loudly at first meeting, and maybe even the second meeting. Once he has been allowed the time and space to settle and begin to feel comfortable, he will soften, attach, and seek close attention. He has shown that he can be a loyal companion, but he must feel his way first. Hunter is living in a multi foster-dog household with adults. But since he does have some territorial tendencies, surrounding food and possessions, it will be best for both Hunter and his new family to be an only dog. He seems able to go back and forth between the woman and man in the home, either lap is fine, but he has really taken favor to the man of the house. Hunter has not been tested with or exposed to cats. Please, no children for this dog. A fenced yard is a must! Hunter loves to be outdoors watching the birds, squirrels, and going on a backyard chase.",

            "description": "Frida is a sweet senior who has lived outside all her life. At 10 years old, she now enjoys the comforts of an indoor home and is learning new manners for inside the house including potty training. A regular potty schedule is important for her. Frida has had a lot of change in her life recently, so it isnt surprising that she has some anxiety issues. She can take a while to adjust to living with other dogs and may have some squabbles with them. She soaks up love and attention from her people although it takes her longer to warm up to men. Frida cant get enough attention from her people which may be why she is slow to share that with other animals in the house. Fridas right eye was removed due to uncontrolled glaucoma, which you may not notice right away because she has the most amazing tan eyebrows. She has partial vision in her left eye and will need on-going eye medication for it. Frida navigates well, can get up on the furniture and never has a problem finding her person. Being with you and getting belly rubs are favorite pastimes, although she also enjoys chewing on her toys (and sometimes the laundry). Frida needs a quiet home with a yard and people who are home most of the day. Frida is learning a lot in her foster home, but gets nervous when picked up and car rides are scary. This sweet and silly girl is a loyal companion that will bring much love and laughter to her forever home.",

He wants nothing more than to be with his human, whether on the couch or hiking or camping. He loves his people and loves to snuggle! Harley needs to be an only dog. He aggressively attacks all other dogs immediately, even dogs he has met before. He has extreme separation anxiety. He must always be in a crate when left alone, otherwise he will engage in destructive behavior. He can be vocal when left alone in his crate and is distraught. He dislikes riding in the car and does best in a crate. He requires a yard with a privacy fence and no neighboring dogs. Harley needs a stay-at-home parent.

She is very afraid of meeting new people and needs someone who can deal with fear anxiety. Shes a dog who loves physical attention, and to snuggle with her peeps. She gets along fine with other dogs, eats well (dry food), and is mostly (but not quite) housebroken. She barks when she sees or hears people outside, but her barking isnt excessive. She loves to be outside, whether is hanging out in the backyard, or walking on a leash around the block. Shes a very fast runner, enjoys chasing squirrels in the back yard, and will even fetch a ball! Sadie is very fearful strangers, and she can act aggressively when she is frightened. Her behaviors include barking, growling, and biting. She needs to be restrained when introduced to new people until she learns to trust them. Sadie would do best with someone who can work with her on this, and manage her behaviors until she learns to be less fearful. Sadie will also do best where she has access to a secure yard where she can run and play. Sadie is a wonderful little dog who would bring joy to anyones home. She will make you smile with her antics, and will melt your heart with her big brown eyes. Shes a young, healthy girl who wants nothing more than to have a forever home of her own!",

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: 11/19/2020\nReason for being in rescue: Berto was seized as part of a local case. Carolina Poodle Rescue partnered with the shelter to help him and his brothers and sisters.\nFoster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SC\nSpecial Needs? Berto was neutered on 11/23/20. He is now ready for his forever home.\nWeight: 11.4 lbs\nHeight: 9 in\nSpayed/Neutered: No\n\nAdoption Fee: $200\n\nFence needed? No\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? As adorable as he is, Berto is NOT for a first time dog owner. Berto is young, but has lived a lot of years in his short life. He requires an experienced owner that has patience and time to earn his trust. He would be happy as the only dog, or living with a confident dog that will teach him without overpowering him. Berto is not suited for a home with children. A more quiet routine is his speed.\n\nWhat is my personality like? Berto was seized with a group of dogs as part of a local effort. We know very little about their past. Berto is a little shy, and doesn't fully understand what love means. Once he warms up, Berto wants to spend his entire day with his person. Berto comes from a home with lots of other dogs. He is absolutely fine in a pack. However, he'd be equally happy as the only dog.\n\nBerto is a young dog with a ton of potential. His sassy smile screams bad to the bone, but his heart is made of gold. At the core, Berto is a young dog that lacks confidence. In a group of dogs, he gets picked on by more dominant dogs. He is slow to approach and absolutely does not want you to pick him up, but sit down and he jumps right into your lap for snuggles.\n\nBerto loves to play. Toys have clearly been part of his past and he tosses toys around with enthusiasm. He also loves to snuggle in fuzzy blankets. We are certain this is the chihuahua in his DNA. He is crate trained and quiet for feeding. Like his siblings, Berto is really decompressing and learning and starting to come out of his shell. Underneath that somewhat timid shell is an absolute angel!\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Timid and standoffish\n\nOther tips and tidbits: Berto's estimated birthday is 11/13/2017\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

            "description": "Radar is a 9 year old cocker/cavalier boy who was found drowning in a canal in southwest Miami Dade county. Thank goodness for a good samaritan that fished him out and saved his life!!! It is evident that Radar has suffered abuse throughout his life - he is deathly afraid of being grabbed by his neck or a leash being put on him so he must go to an adopter that is patient, has dog experience , and has a fenced in yard where Radar can go outside and romp around safely without issue- he does walk well on a leash once put on him but it is that initial move that he is scared of. Radar is very apprehensive of new people but will warm up to you once he knows you will not hurt him and he can trust you---he just needs time and patience and lots of love. This boy is also deaf so he will go to a home with NO KIDS that can come upon him and scare him. Once Radar knows he is safe he will follow you around and looks for attention and petting. If interested in adopting Radar please fill out an application at www.floridacockerrescue.org   ADOPTION FEE: $265.00",

He's now neutered, has current vaccinations and micro-chipped.Willie was a stray in Kerman a couple months ago. Just a baby. It seemed he had no human experience. No leash experience and so frightened. Nice dog, but kinda feral.Willie didn't have a chance if he went into this little rural shelter. The director reached out to the best, Kalyn. She contacted me, explained and offered to keep Willie until he could get in here.Kalyn got him walking on a leash and follow her along without one. She says he's only a reliable as the dog he's running with, but we'll take it! There's lots of dogs that have good recall here, and we'll teach Willie!He's here now and great with my entire pack. He's a just kid! He's a little shy, but once he's on a leash he's your dog. He'll need some attention to get him comfortable, but he's happy and excited about life!I'm looking for a home with another dog though. Help show Willie the way! He'd be fine with kids, and possibly cats. He's very sweet.Willie's looking for a home - could it be yours?\nPhotos updated at: https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?vanity=cchdrescue.org&set=a.2724223784460350\nAdoption fee is $350 and includes sterilization surgery, vaccinations, flea & tick abatement, worming, transportation to us, microchipping + chip registration.

You see I spent most of my life on the other end of a chain until I got to go to Rescue. Fortunately I didn\u2019t end up with heart worms but my foster mom has her work cut out for her getting me crate trained and housetrained and I\u2018ve really come along way. I can proudly say that I am both now! I have to admit I really don\u2019t like to stay in the crate. I don\u2019t mind sleeping there but I can\u2019t wait for my play time and outside time. But then I love to come in and go to my crate because I know I get treats! I\u2019m just so happy to be in a new place with new friends and lots of food and love that I get really excited! And they have toys and balls here! I didn\u2019t know what those were but boy are they fun!\n\nMy favorite thing is eating as I was really underweight when I got here.\u00a0I\u2019m getting healthier now too. And my coat looks much better as I had really bad flea allergy but my fur is growing back in and it\u2019s going to be lush and beautiful soon.\u00a0I get along with most of my foster brothers and sisters but I had no social skills at all so they\u2019re helping me and they have to be patient with me. Living on the end of the chain doesn\u2019t do much for one\u2019s personality. But I have really come along way on that too. I\u2019m just getting better and better at everything every day. I just need the chance to prove myself.\u00a0 Will you be the one that takes a chance on me? If so please fill out your application today! I will make you proud!\u00a0\n\nLink to Application:\nhttp://www.gsdrescuectx.com/adoption-application.html\n",

I guess that\u2019s when I got Heartworms as they didn\u2019t really have time for me anymore and I was outside all the time, and I guess they forgot to give me my prevention. My family said they still loved me but they just couldn\u2019t care for me the way I needed to be cared for so they took me to the shelter. Then my life took a turn for the better when my foster mom came into it. I was not doing well at all in the shelter but the rescue saved me.\n\nI\u2019m getting healthier and they\u2019re giving me medicine to help kill my heart worms. They will give my adopters the medicine and all the directions to keep doing this for me. I get to eat really well here too and my foster mom is giving me sardines in my food because I was also anemic.\u00a0My coat is starting to get shinier and healthier again. I like it here but I would really like to have my own home again. I have a really unusual coloring for German Shepherd. I am chocolate and tan.\u00a0 I think that makes me special! So if you would like to give me a second chance and come live with you I promise I will be a good boy and love you!\n\nLink to Application:\nhttp://www.gsdrescuectx.com/adoption-application.html\n",

As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals or how large puppies will be when fully grown.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our 'Visit' page for hours and directions to our shelter.

We get one run in life.\u201d  Well, except for those of us lucky to get a second chance and the journey is worth it if it ends with you as my forever home.  The name is Suki.  I am a 4 year old, 60 lbs, female Husky mix.  There is absolutely no question that I am the smartest of them all.  I know just about all the tricks in the book, sit, down, shake, roll over, jump, high five, crate, speak and sooo much more.  Not only that, I have already mastered all of that house and crate training business.  While I may spend most of my time laying back and hanging out, don\u2019t think that I won\u2019t sprint to the door for an exciting game of fetch.  I absolutely love fetch!  I\u2019m good with other dogs, cats and older kids.  The leash is absolutely no problem for me but I need a fenced in yard. I am enrolled in some extra training classes at a local prison, I should be back around mid-February! With me being such a catch you\u2019ll likely need to be \u201cFast and Furious\u201d to get that application in, so don\u2019t hesitate in filling out that application for me, Suki.  \n\nMy adoption fee is $150 and includes my spay/neuter, vaccinations, wellness exam, heartworm test, and microchip! If you're interested in meeting/adopting me, please visit www.rescueonespringfield.com/our-adoption-process/adoption-application/ and fill out the form! We do adopt out of state with vet references and video home check. *Adopter is responsible for coming to get the dog and returning the dog if the adoption does not work out* \n\nDon't forget to LIKE us on Facebook!-www.facebook.com/rescueonespringfield\n\n*Remember, dogs are pack animals. Because of this, Rescue One does not adopt to outdoor-only homes. Pets are family and are not disposable.  Please make sure that you are 100% committed to a pet before considering adding one to your home.",

            "description": "Felix is a young male who we just rescued from a San Francisco, CA shelter.  He is currently living with his foster family in Southern California, and we are learning more about him. We think Felix is around one year old. He has lots of energy and loves playing with toys! He is goofy and loveable!\n\nFelix is looking for a home that is patient, loving, and willing to help him learn manners and basic training.  He can be a little skiddish at first with strangers (especially men) and needs slow introductions to warm up to you. His new family should not have cats, but he may be ok with a female dog if the family is experienced and willing to separate and do slow and proper introductions. \n\nFelix says you can check out the rest of his profile here:\nhttps://petlover.petstablished.com/pets/public/887005?awo=DC+Dogos%2C+Inc&widget=false\n\nDogos are a wonderful breed but we urge anyone interested to dig in and do a lot of research before deciding if they are a good fit for your home. They require a lot of attention and training with them never ends!  Boundaries must be enforced and they often need reminders as they push past boundaires you set! Dogos are loving, kind and gentle but don't mistake that for weakness because they are equally powerful and intense as well! Everyone in the home must be on board with having a dogo and play a major role in their daily routines and training. Yes it is work, but the rewards are ten-fold! Lazy homes don't work for dogos as they need stimulation, exercise, and lots of attention too during their younger years.  Our goal in rescue is to be as transparent as we can about each and every dog plus make sure new families really understand the needs of a dogo!",

He has starting special training practices since he has sight & hearing issues & is doing great! He is crate trained, loves car rides and is potty trained already! He is confident, smart & happy, not to mention beautiful! He will do best in a home as an only dog, but with the option to attend doggie daycare once a week, or have regular playdates with friends dogs.\nWhile he does have disabilities with his senses, he makes up for it in personality, cuteness and fun & cuddles.\nSully is eligible for adoption to applicants that live within 5 hours of Dallas/FW.

Ollie was recently returned to EHR and is in search of his new home. He was not socialized with other dogs in his early years so he would have to do slow introductions to any potential sibling. He is the PERFECT fetch player. He can sometimes get a bit too into his food/high value items so he would be best with older/considerate kids if any! Ollie loves walks on our trails and behaves so nicely in his run.\n\nIf you are interested in Ollie, visit EHRDOGS.ORG to fill out an application and be sure to mention OLLIE by name!!!",

This allows us to better understand each dog's individual personalities. \n\nYou must complete an application before you can schedule a meet and greet with each animal. The application can be found here: http://peaceforpits.org/adoptionfoster-application/ or if you prefer a Word version, download it here: https://goo.gl/bKo84P and email it to p4papplications@gmail.com.

She loves to play fetch and tug of war and will play all day! It is very important for Greta to get a lot of exercise in her new home and will need frequent walks or playtime in a backyard. She knows sit, down, shake, stay, and she will wait at doorways on command. If you think that Greta would be the perfect addition to your home please ask for Cameron at the front desk and you will be introduced to her as she is not on the main adoption floor. Please no young kids for Greta please she may jump on them and knock them over or jump in their faces in excitement. Only Avaliable Thursday-Saturday",

Lucy is a playful and active girl who would do best in a home with a large backyard. She loves to play fetch and romp around. She also enjoys the company of most dogs. Although she's very active she also loves to snuggle and cuddle up with her favorite people. Lucy would benefit from continued training and does need some work on her leash skills. Overall Lucy is just a sweet, fun loving girl who would make an excellent family dog!",

She is a darling fuzzy greyhound :) She needs a very active home with a securely fenced yard. Her previous adopter ran and biked with her. Nala is curious, fearless, fast and agile. She is eager to learn. She loves car rides. She can do ok with other dogs, but she plays rough so she does best with sturdier, playful breeds rather than a greyhound type dog, and playing with other dogs gets her riled up so she may do better as an only dog. Nala has lived in a home as an only dog, but her dad's job changed so she had to come back to us to find a new home. Nala needs a home without cats. Nala has been friendly to children she has met when out and about, but she may be too active for young children. Nala came to us from South Korea.\nSponsored by Liz Peterson\nSponsored by Ashley Bennett, in honor of her wonderful auntie Cheryl KirkWould you like to sponsor Nala until she gets adopted?

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: 11/2/2020\n\nReason for being in rescue: Bentley was abandoned, in his crate, at the door of a North Carolina shelter.\nFoster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SC\nSpecial Needs? Bentley will be adopted on a neuter contract. Bentley appears to be neutered - there are no testicles showing but since we have no actual proof of the surgery. We're erring on the side of caution and letting you know that no documentation from a vet exists. About 10% of dogs are cryptochoid (only one testicle descends). A much smaller portion that that are double-cryptorchoid (neither testicle descends). But it does happen. In over 4,000 male dogs, we have had 2 instances of documented double cryptorchoid dogs.\nWeight: 36 lbs\nHeight: 15 in at the shoulder\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $349\n\nFence needed? Yes\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Fenced in yard is a must and long, long walks would be ideal. Bentley is looking for an adult person to spend his time and days with. No children under 10. He's a strong willed dog and loud noises (think children at play) would escalate him higher than he needs to go. For instance, when other dogs in his play group are running the fence, he'll snap at the other dog \"get out of my face.\" With respectful, happy and playful dogs he's great.\n\nHe needs a dog friend - he is fearful when meeting new people without one but his dog friend will ultimately let Bentley be the boss. Sex does not matter to Bentley. What matters is the other dog is even tempered. If you want Bentley as an only dog, be prepared to be here several hours to allow him time to learn to trust you.\n\nWhat is my personality like? Hyper, playful and headstrong. Bentley's terrier personality is one that is delightful to the experienced terrier person but somewhat intimidating if you don't know the breed. Bentley's inner dog says I am sassy and outgoing but his experiences have said don't trust humans.\n\nBentley was badly matted when he was first found and it took several weeks to allow grooming. His caregiver that he trusts stayed with the groomer and he was found as long as his comfort person was nearby and allowed shaving. Shave downs like this one hurt. Bentley's new person will recognize that hygiene has not been done as needed and will have him in regularly (I suggest every two weeks) for several months to insure that Bentley ends up loving, not fearing, the grooming process.\n\nWhen introduced to cats, he was totally indifferent. He walks fairly well on a leash but needs some skills in that area. He does not know basics such as sit although we are working on those with him.\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Bentley is very friendly and happy upon meeting a new person if there are other dogs around. If there are no other dogs around, he is timid at first, unsure of what is expected. He can be bribed with treats and with one of his main caregivers.\n\nOther tips and tidbits: Bentley's estimated birthday is 10/28/2018\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

We dont know her story but her face said it all and her body.\nShe was in shock. She has come so far. She smiles everyday now and every step is joyful for her.\nShe is learning to go on pack walks and loves being with other dogs. She loves anyone that has a kind gentle approach and a treat! She will smile from ear to ear and trot right along.\nWe think she is around 3-4 years old.\nShe wants to be happy and please her people.\nWe would like a calm home with another nice dog for company, slow walks but will go wherever you want.\nLots of love, kindness and treats, She is very special. A gentle soul.\nWe have video snippets of her with dogs and out walking, but no time to load them to petfinder yet.\nAll dog friendly! Wants to love and live life with her friend or family!\n She is about 50 pounds. Her face tells us she is a mixed breed and maybe some boxer, Shepherd. Not really sure.. \nShe wants her family or person so bad. She longs to make you happy and loves to play with all dogs. She knows how to sit and simple obedience. She is completely dog friendly with both small and large dogs and probably cat friendly.  She is easy on a leash and loves her trail walks. She is incredibly loving, bright and a real star. Somebody will be very lucky to have her. \nShe would love to go hiking, camping, car rides and to the beach. She is looking to see the world with her new person or family.\n \nShe is up to date on vaccines, spayed and micro-chipped. \nPlease go to our website and fill out an application telling us why you would make her  or one of her friends a great home!\nwww.LindaBlairWorldheart.org\n \nApplications can be found on our website www.LindaBlairWorldheart.org under the Adopt today tab.

I am a happy, bouncy girl who loves to get attention. I would do well with someone who is active and can keep up with me. I promise to be the most loyal and loving girl. I would be best as the ONLY spoiled pet in the household. \n\nI am currently in Arkansas, and Almost Home is helping me get exposure by posting me on their website too. If you are interested in me please fill out an application on Almost Home's website and they will be in touch with more information on how to meet me! \n\nMedical: Heartworm positive (started slow kill treatment).\n\nHere's what my favorite volunteer has to say about me! \n\n\"\"Bunny was named this because she has some hops! This girl is sweet! She is high energy but when she's tired, she's out! She loves exercise, people and is fine with other dogs. Because of her energy, she is often a little much for the feline kind to handle. And how can you not love those ears!\"\" \n\nAdoption application: https://us01.sheltermanager.com/service?account=ah0334&method=online_form_html&formid=5",

She was living outside even after an accident that left her paralyzed and unable to use her back legs. She was living outside thru 2 hurricane and a tropical storm. \n\nWe immediately sent someone to go get her. She didn't know these people but ran from the son to their vehicle and jumped right in. She is the most kind gentle loving dog. She just wants to be loved. \n\nWe are uncertain exactly what happened to her to cause this injury. She had never seen a vet for medical treatment after her injury. We took her to our vet and started her on some injections and we started water therapy. Covie is so determined to walk. She is now standing on her own without our help and will take a few steps. She needs a family that will continue to help her build her muscles in her back legs. We are going to start laser therapy with her very soon. She does have a wheelchair that comes with her. She loves to go for walks. \n\nHowever she would absolutely love to just cuddle on the floor or couch with some help up. \n\nCovie is good with other dogs that are respectful of her space and more laid back. She is not good with cats. She is also good with kids but we feel a home with older kids is best. She is spayed, up to date on shots, microchipped and on heartworm prevention. \n\nTo apply for Covie go to www.caninehavenrescue.org under available adoptions tab. Her adoption fee is $200",

So after 3 hours on scene we were finally able to catch her. It was obvious that she had pups recently. We walked her around looking and searching for puppies. No pups were found. We took her right to a vet to see what they thought. He thought that pups had already been weaned and someone dumped momma. We took her home and got her settled for the night. \n\nThe next day we had to go pick up dogs out of town. Before we left we spent time with Olive. We did her shots and loved on her. But something in her eyes said something was off. 4 hours into our trip we called the neighbor to go get her and our 25 ft lead. We told her exactly where to take her. We just felt there were puppies out there. We also called for others to go help search. When Olive got out of the vehicle she took off running. She led them right to where her 4 tiny pups were hidden way up inside a brush pile. The pups were only about 48 hours old and had been without mom for 24 of that. Everyone was fine and the pups have homes of their own. Now its Olives turn for a forever home where she will be loved and not thrown out like trash.\n\nShe is good with other dogs big and small. She is also good with cats and kids. She is up to date on shots, rabies, and will be spayed at the end of the month. She is also microchipped and heartworm negative and on prevention. Her adoption fee is $300. To adopt go to www.caninehavenrescue.org under available adoptions tab.",

            "description": "This is Chance. He is a handsome young male, 1-2 years old, mix, weighing about 40lbs. There is a little bit of hound, certainly seen in his body and tail, with a boxy, solid head, like a St. Bernhard, only a little smaller. He has beautiful white short fur with back spots, and great looking black/white coloring on his face. Safe to say he is a good old all-American mutt.\n\nChance has had a little bit of a rough start and wasnt treated well and ended up in a kennel in Southern Missouri. Rescue groups descended on the kennel that Chance was in, taking all the other dogs. Chance would have been the last dog there except we decided to give Chance a chance, and boy are we glad we did!!!\n\nChance is housebroken and very smart. He has had a little bit of training and, we feel, would do very well with more. He is still young and full of energy. He loves walks, playing fetch with a ball, and playing with other dogs. That said, he does do well with other dogs. He is a snuggler, loves to sit with you, or on your lap. He is also a kisser, so be ready for that. He is kennel trained and spends nights there. Not sure how he would do around cats. It's also best if Chance has no kids in the home, as he is startled by them, and unsure of their next move which makes him uncomfortable and nervous.\n\nHe has really latched on the adult human male in his foster home. Because of this, we feel he would do best with a male in the home, maybe an active guy who wants to take his doggie everywhere with him! He is nervous around new people, visitors who come over to his house, and it does take him a while to warm up to anyone new. Because of this, he will need someone with lots of patience to give him and lots of time to settle in, utlizing some training techniques to help him adopt. He is easily startled by load noises and surprises; and will approach cautiously when you reassure him that everything is okay. He is still a little nervous on car rides but settles down with positive attention.\n\nChance is up to date on all shots, is heart worm free, and micro-chipped. His adoption fee is $300, he is fostered in the KC area. Apps can be filled out at bassetandbeagle.org.",

Please follow the rules below to ensure your application is reviewed; pay attention closely to these instructions because applications will NOT be processed if they are not followed. Please keep in mind that dog/cat availability is currently changing by the hour; you will receive an email if the animal you are interested in is no longer available.

The entire household, including current dogs, must be present for the appointment.

The introductions will take place outside in our parking lot.\n\n-We will continue to perform vet checks for current and prior pets in the household.\n\n-Home visits will be in person for the yard and virtual for inside the home.\n\n-Finalizing the adoption will also be scheduled by appointment.\n\nWhile this process may seem cumbersome, it is interim during COVID-19, and it is designed to help us respond to the volume of emails we receive every day. Since we are receiving a high volume of applications, please be patient if a dog/cat is no longer available. \n\nThank you for your understanding.",

We would recommend children older that could run with him and play ball. Ranger is good with dogs in a home now with a female dog. Ranger loves attention and gives hugs.

He is super playful, he will throw his own toys and chase after them. Hes also very loving, he prefers to be within 5 feet of his human at all times, laying at my feet while I work. He would do best with a family who can be home with him a majority of the time since he doesnt ever want to be alone. He does not seem to understand he isnt lap dog and loves to try to sit on our laps. He loves to go on walks but gets very excited and is working on not pulling so hard on the leash, especially at the beginning of the walk. He is unsure of strangers but warms up very quickly, unless you are wearing a mask, this makes him bark. He is curious about shoes or other items he finds and will quickly give them over and go back to his toys. Our Chihuahua is not welcoming but he tries to play with her anyway, I imagine he would do well with any dog that would want to play. He needs a home without cats.",

This sweet lady and her sweetheart, Lennox, lost their home when their owner passed away. Now, they're in foster and looking for a new forever home, hopefully together again. Mountain (Mo) is a sleek, very athletic girl who loves to chase the rope toy and bring it right back to her foster, sometimes even dropping it at her feet...or 10 feet away. She is very affectionate and cuddles up to her people or her buddy Lennox, laying her head on his back. She would also probably love to sit on the couch and watch tv. Mo is very well house-trained and sits on command. She doesn't chew on things, but prefers to lay in the garden in the nice soft soil. She is learning to wait to go out the door and not knock Lennox out of the way. She sleeps in her crate most of the night or next to her foster's bed. On walks with Lennox, Mo leads the way. On walks alone, she walks nicely at her foster's side. Mo is such a sweet, smart girl who will flourish in a secure home environment. Come meet her and Lennox. They would love to meet you - and follow you home!",

See the bottom of this bio for more FAQs regarding our adoption process before emailing.****\n\nName: Jagger 2 & Jada\n\nAge: 6-7 years\n\nCurrent Weight: 50-60 pounds\n\nRescued from: Texas\n\nJada and Jagger were rescued from an area where there is an abundance of homeless dogs, and not a lot of shelter space for them to go while they wait for their forever homes. They will be arriving at SNARR's Adoption Center in Brewster, NY on December 18, 2020 ready for adoption!\n\nThis friendly duo was saved from becoming just another pair of owner surrendered dogs in an over-crowded Texas shelter when SNARR agreed to help.  Jagger and Jada are house-trained, great with kids and just great all around pups.  They have lived in the same home with each other and it's apparent they love to be with each other, so we didn't have the heart to separate them.  They need to find a home together with a fenced in yard for them to enjoy the great outdoors, chase squirrels, sun bath and just run free.  Both dogs are very sweet, Jada is a little timid at first and definitely feels more confident and comfortable when Jagger is with her.  You may notice that Jagger sits a little funny that is due to a plate installed to repair his leg when he was younger.  These darling souls are looking for a wonderful family that will enjoy taking them on neighborhood walks and hiking at the local park.  If you are looking for two wonderful dogs to love, spoil and take on adventures, maybe Jada and Jagger are your perfect duo.    \n\nHealth: up to date on required vaccines\n\nAdoption fee: $700\n\nIMPORTANT: Jada has not yet been altered. For any dog or puppy that is not able to be spayed/neutered prior to adoption, SNARR requires a $125 deposit in addition to your adoption fee, as well as a signed Spay/Neuter Contract stating you will have this dog altered within 6 months of adoption. The $125 deposit will be returned once the contract has been fulfilled. \n\nTo apply to adopt Jagger & Jada, fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. \n**Meet and greets will not be scheduled without an approved application.**\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $375 for adults. Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n\n\n",

Jacquie Is a 10 year old who thinks he is half that age. May have been debarked since he has a squeaky sounding 'bark' Happy go lucky and loves everyone would probably do well with cats.

Please email Linda at lbredfire@sbcglobal.net or call WT&F's Dog Team voicemail 707-812-9030 to get a jump on the process, ask questions, and/or to confirm they will be there. Dog adoptions are held outside Napa Petco every Saturday - 12:30pm to 4:00pm.\nThis dog comes spayed/neutered, microchipped, vaccinated, dewormed, heartworm tested negative, and more with an adoption fee/donation to Whiskers, Tails and Ferals in Napa, CA.

I know how to sit, and I am working on stay and shake. I love everyone, so much that sometimes I can't contain my excitement. I do \"play bite\" and can get mouthy when I'm excited. I really need a patient adopter who can help me with my manners, I need to learn arms are not toys and how to walk nicely on a leash. I'm only 9 months old, so I'm still a puppy and really need a home that is willing to work with me. I have done well with other energetic dogs who love to play. I probably have too much energy for a cat, though. I think kids are awesome, but I might accidentally knock them over or play rough with them until I learn better.

He's really scared of new things and new people and could use some training and encouragement to build his confidence. He was rescued in Mexico originally and is a tripod, and he gets around fantastic. We'd love to see him in a home with a happy, social dog he could learn from and owners that have experience and will be patient with him. He is great on walks with other dogs and is playful with other dogs. Complete an application to meet him at www.2darescue.org\n\nHere at 2DaRescue we value the health and safety of our animals. Our adoption fee is $300 for adult dogs We feed high quality dog food, Costco Kirkland Signature super Premium Chicken and Brown Rice. All of our dogs come spayed/neutered, fully vaccinated with proof, microchipped, 4Dx tested (basic blood work that tests for diseases), currently on monthly preventatives, and dewormed with a board spectrum dewormer.\n\nLocated in the Phoenix, Arizona area Please note, we only do in state adoptions!",

He's like a bold cup of coffee sweetened with lots of sugar. Rasko is currently being treated for a yeast infection on his skin. His adoption fee is $150 and helps cover the cost of his neuter, vaccinations, worming, monthly heart worm, flea and tick preventive, microchip and care while at CCHS.

            "description": "To be considered for adopting a dog from Canine Lifeline, you must have an approved application must be on file. Please visit http://www.caninelifeline.org/adoption-process/ for more information about our adoption process and to submit an online application.\n\nSweet Pea is a gorgeous 6 year-old Aussie/Border Collie mix spayed female with a fluffy bobtail who was surrendered to an overcrowded county dog shelter by her owner along with another Border Collie mix named Spicy after she had to move to an assisted living facility and couldn't take the dogs with her. Both dogs made the trip to Canine Lifeline so they could take their time finding great new forever homes. While they may have lived together peacefully in the past, we quickly discovered upon their arrival that Sweet Pea and Spicy no longer want to have anything to do with each other. Perhaps the stress of all the recent changes in their life has taken its toll on their relationship, but they will need to go to separate new homes. Sweet Pea is also unpredictable around other dogs so does need to go to a home where she'll be an only dog. . Sweet Pea is a very sensitive girl whose world has been turned upside down and she's trying very hard to process all the recent changes in her life. She was very skittish when she first arrived here with us. She is still head shy and apprehensive when we slip a leash over her head so not sure if something happened to her in the past that makes her wary of that type of movement. She's beginning to trust us now and once she's in a quiet place away from other dogs, she loves to snuggle up with her new human friends and enjoys being petted and loved. The shelter told us that Sweet Pea is cat-aggressive so will need a kitty-free home. She's been a little nervous on a leash so is going to need a home in a rural area or very quiet neighborhood so she can relax and enjoy life. A yard with a secure aboveground fence is also required for her. Busy urban or high-density suburban living would be terrifying for her. We know there's a kind person or family out there who can make the world right again for Sweet Pea and we look forward to seeing her get the chance to relax and settle into her new forever home. Sweet Pea weighs about 48 pounds and her adoption fee is $325. She's spayed, heartworm negative and on monthly preventative, up to date on vaccinations including bivalent canine influenza, wormed, on flea and tick preventative, and microchipped. As part of the adoption process, all adopters must commit to a two-week adjustment period to make sure it's a great match before the adoption is finalized. Please email info@caninelifeline.org if you're interested in Sweet Pea. An approved application is required before we schedule meets with any of our dogs. Please note that we don't place our dogs in homes with children under 7 years of age. We correspond via email so please check your junkmail or spam folder to make sure our reply hasn't landed in there. Please visit our website at www.caninelifeline.org to see more photos of Sweet Pea and to submit an online application if you live in Northeast OH.",

Please read the bio before sending questions - we answer all we know about the dog here.\n\nHi there! My name is Harry but everyone always greets me with \"Hi, Handsome\" . People are always fussing over my big head and beautiful coat but I don't mind because this involves lots of pets and belly rubs!\n\nI'm only 3 years old so I'm a lot of fun and I will keep you laughing all day long. People say I am a BIG boy (I don't see it) ...sometimes I don't know my own strength and may walk with my weight, but I'm a quick learner!\n\nI am a unique breed called Leonberger mix known for being super sweet, loyal, and reminiscent of a majestic lion . I love to go on walks and introduce myself to everyone on the sidewalk (sometimes I even roll over at strangers feet just so they rub my belly) but as soon as we get home I like to lay down at (on) my humans feet.\n\nI am house broken, I never bark, and I do great in the car!! I am also super smart and know a lot of commands like sit, down, and shake. I was alone on my own for awhile, so now all I want to do is stay by my human as much as I can. I get sad and a little anxious when everyone leaves but I'm sure once I find my forever family, it'll just take me a bit to adjust and trust that you aren't leaving me.\n\nI'd love to find my furever home! I am still young with lots and lots of love to give. If you are ready for snuggles and telling me I am handsome all day long, let me know! Can't wait to meet you you.\n\nHe can be dog selective...we're not sure about cats or small children...mature older children should be okay. Harry is neutered/microchipped, vaccinated & on Flea & Heartworm preventative.\n\nHarry's Adoption fee is $400 - obedience training is required after adoption.\n\nObedience training is also required for all our pups. We understand with what is going on in the world that this may be a bit delayed. Please email us the completion certificate.\n\nTo apply to foster or adopt please fill out application at\n\nwww.heidislegacydogrescue.com/apply-to-foster-or-adopt\n\nThank you for completing the application. We are all volunteers and short on time, we will contact you back only if we have more questions or your application is approved and you will be invited to meet the dog. We apologize for not being able to answer everyone back.\n\nFor more information contact Kelly.V@HeidisLegacyDogRescue.com\n\nDOGS are in Foster Homes. There is NO shelter.\n\n**Our companions MUST live in your home as part of your family.**We do not transport.\n\n**See our website for more information. www.HeidisLegacyDogRescue.com\n\nAll communication is thru email so please be patient with us. We are all volunteers and work full time jobs and have families of our own.\n\nIt takes anywhere between 3-7 days to process an application - the more complete the application the easier it is for us to process it.

I am a little over 5 years old and am a Doberman mix. My family surrendered me here because I was not fitting into their new lifestyle. I lived with them for the last 4 years of my life, so you can imagine how I am feeling. Initially, I do take time to trust new people. I\u2019ve warmed up to the some of the staff here and improve every day! I am quite smart, know lots of commands and am affectionate once I get comfortable. I even sport this pink get up so great! I am strong and can be reactive towards other dogs at first, so I will need a strong handler. I would do best in an adult only home, one that isn\u2019t too chaotic. My last home was, so I am sure that took a mental toll on me at times. I am anxious, but again a sweetheart. I like to chase tennis balls and will bring them back! Though reactive towards the dogs I have met here, I do well once I am used to the dog. I was off leash with a few here, just hung out and enjoyed the company. I would do best with a dog that isn\u2019t so pushy or be your only pet! No cats for me either, wasn\u2019t too fond of them in my last home. It might take us a few meetings for me to feel okay, so please be patient with me! I have went through a lot like my other shelter friends have, but I just need time to get to know you. I will need an experienced dog family, adjusting to a new environment might be a challenge for me and could use a family that\u2019ll help me transition stress free!\n\u00a0\nAslan is neutered, chipped and UTD on vaccinations.

For more information, please email: amy.farner@gmail.com.\n\nTo visit with this pup, please make an appointment here: https://mcaccappointments.as.me/adopt. NOTE: People who sign up for these appointments often no-show. We have been told that you can go straight to the shelter and let them know you are there to meet this particular dog. From what we understand, the shelter will squeeze you in except between 12-3PM and near the 6PM closing time. (Please know this is not a guarantee). If the dog is at risk, please ask for a supervisor to meet that particular dog. We hope your adoption process is smooth and full of happiness!\n\nEggplant is such a fun dog that loves to go for a walk. He pulls a little at first because he's so happy to get out of his kennel but calms down quickly and walks very nicely. He likes to check in regularly with the volunteer who is walking him. It takes a little while to walk Eggplant because he loves to sniff everything! He likes the play yard and takes treats gently. He is an affectionate boy who loves to give kisses. And, he's potty trained! Eggplant would be better in a home with older children and as an only dog. He should not be taken to a dog park.\n\nEggplant is an older dog that still has some spring in his step! If you think Eggplant would be a good fit in your home, please come and meet him today!\n\nThis amazing pup is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4439018.\n\n*Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG. MCACC is located at 2500 S. 27th Avenue, Phoenix. Different adoption fees/policy may apply. Please visit MCACC's website http://www.maricopa.gov/pets/locations.aspx for hours. You may also wish to call 602-506-7387 (PETS) and provide the animal's A# above to verify is still available.",

            "description": "These brothers strayed up to the rescuer's home, looking for a safe place.  Sadly, the family has 3 dogs and couldn't take them all in for their own.  They arrived with Nimbus and her 3 puppies, so adding 6 new dogs wasn't in their best interest.  \n\nWith a guesstimated birthday in Nov. 2019, these boys are hesitant in new experiences.  They're very intelligent and affectionate so are learning at an astonishing rate.  They've captured their foster mom's heart, but she also knows that being in a big dog pack isn't as rewarding as having their own forever families.\n\nBuzz has excellent leash-manners.  He is content in his crate overnight and doesn't make a mess.  He rides well in a car, but is nervous so must be helped in.  When taken on walks in public, he looks to his handler for reassurance in stressful situations.\n\nHe is eager to please, once he is comfortable with his people and the environment.  He's house-trained when kept on a regular schedule.  Currently that is a potty break every 2 hours.  There are cats in his foster home, but he doesn't seem to pay attention to them, being more interested in his doggy friends.\n\nApril 2020:  We are not holding public adoption events at this time.  Qualified families are being invited to appointments to meet specific dogs.  There are currently no opportunities to view multiple dogs and adoption events aren't being held at Tractor Supply in Lenoir.\n\nWhether dogs / puppies come in as strays or owner surrenders, we usually have to make our best guess as to birthdate and breed.   \n\nIf adopted into a home with other animals, particularly cats, your new pet should be crated or secured when you're not available to supervise to insure a harmonious relationship.  \n\nA vet reference is required to confirm responsible pet ownership.  We suggest first time pet owners look for an adult dog for companionship and to gain experience through another rescue or your local government-run animal control..\n\nAdoption fee covers two vaccinations plus spay / neuter if using our local low-cost spay/neuter clinic (overnight stay required) and surgery occurs as agreed upon in the adoption contract.  Convenience fee equal to refundable spay/neuter deposit may be added if using our veterinarian.  Additional fees for 3rd puppy vaccination, refundable spay/neuter deposit, etc. may apply.  \n\nWe are an all-volunteer, foster-based rescue.  We receive no funding from agencies.  Available animals can be seen most Saturdays at Tractor Supply in Lenoir from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.  We recommend interested parties contact us to pre-qualify for adoption so their new furry family can go home once paperwork is complete.  Fees are required in cash.  For more information on our organization, our website is www.petpartnersrescue.org.",

            "description": "These sisters strayed into their rescuers yard as pups.  The family loves them, but must keep them outside and wants a better life for them.\n\nWith a guesstimated birthday in Aug. 2019, Ellie weighs about 32 lb.  She is affectionate and wants to please.  \n\nEllie's learning leash, crate, and house-manners in her foster home.  She'll wait for potty breaks when kept on a regular schedule (currently every other hour).  She can climb out of a 6-foot high fence to get to the house - which is where she wants to live.  She likes polite dogs and ignores the cats in her foster home.\n\nApril 2020:  We are not holding public adoption events at this time.  Qualified families are being invited to appointments to meet specific dogs.  There are currently no opportunities to view multiple dogs and adoption events aren't being held at Tractor Supply in Lenoir.\n\nWhether dogs / puppies come in as strays or owner surrenders, we usually have to make our best guess as to birthdate and breed.   \n\nIf adopted into a home with other animals, particularly cats, your new pet should be crated or secured when you're not available to supervise to insure a harmonious relationship.  \n\nA vet reference is required to confirm responsible pet ownership.  We suggest first time pet owners look for an adult dog for companionship and to gain experience through another rescue or your local government-run animal control..\n\nAdoption fee covers two vaccinations plus spay / neuter if using our local low-cost spay/neuter clinic (overnight stay required) and surgery occurs as agreed upon in the adoption contract.  Convenience fee equal to refundable spay/neuter deposit may be added if using our veterinarian.  Additional fees for 3rd puppy vaccination, refundable spay/neuter deposit, etc. may apply.  \n\nWe are an all-volunteer, foster-based rescue.  We receive no funding from agencies.  Available animals can be seen most Saturdays at Tractor Supply in Lenoir from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.  We recommend interested parties contact us to pre-qualify for adoption so their new furry family can go home once paperwork is complete.  Fees are required in cash.  For more information on our organization, our website is www.petpartnersrescue.org.",

She is looking for a forever home where she can be the ONLY PET and keep all of her families love for herself. While Maggie doesn\u2019t want to share a life with another pet she dreams of sharing life with people who will spoil her with lots of cuddles and playtime. Although she has had a difficult past she radiates joy and sweetness and will give one lucky adopter a lifetime full of love and loyalty. Maggie is a pit bull mix and is approximately 7 yrs old. She enjoys playing ball, swimming, and her favorite is to cuddle up for some belly rubs. \n",

Being an older gentleman, he sadly will have a hard time finding an adopter though. Won't you consider loving him? He has an adorable face and expressive eyes. Please call (434) 374-8076 or email lakecountryspca@yahoo.com to adopt. Visit LCSPCA Mon-Sat. from 12-4 pm at 11764 Hwy. 15, Clarksville, VA 23927.",

So if you feel like you can walk a horse ? by all means apply. \nHe does have good manners, don't get us wrong, he's fantastic we are just warning if you aren't strong enough to walk a strong dog maybe  a different dog would be a better choice.\nFlex is available for adoption now!\nTo apply please go to www.amherstanimalshelter.org/adopt\n\nAll dogs over 50 pounds have an adoption rate of only $75 and are fully vetted.\n\nAdoption fee & vetting include: Exam, Distemper, rabies, deworm, flea protection, 3 way heart-worm test and alter.\n\nOur hours are:\nMonday - Friday 10-4, Wednesday open until 6 p.m. and Saturday 9-1.\n\n",

Our veterinary partner estimates Snuggle is 2 years old at time of intake in December 2020. Snuggle is good with people of all ages and other dogs, but she is not a fan of cats. Unbelievably, Snuggle was left outside with her puppies, tied to a tree as her owners moved out. They just left her there, tied up, to fend for herself and her puppies. Not surprisingly, 4 of Snuggle's 10 puppies have passed away. Snuggle has experienced unimaginable cruelty, but now that she's a Rescue Dogs Rock NYC pup, we will head her in the right direction towards a happy life! Snuggle has 4 human foster siblings and she is fantastic with them. After settling in, she is playing well with her foster doggy sibling. Snuggle is calm and appreciates leisure. She is housetrained and is working on her manners. She only barks appropriately, and since she doesn't appreciate cats, she believes that barking at cats is appropriate! Snuggle seeks out affection and will nudge your hand to be petted. She is happy to play if you want to; if not, she is totally okay sitting in your lap or lying in bed. If you would like to be the happy in the rest of Snuggle's life, please apply online to adopt Snuggle (SC) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

Milton is with us now, safe and sound. He is incredibly sweet and well behaved. He is a happy boy who loves to play with other dogs. Milton went home with Judy. He is walking around the house laying on the couch , running around the yard, so a fenced yard is required . Sleeping in the crate no problem, rode well in the car, He will make a great addition to a loving family. He is currently heartworm positive, but please do not let that shy you away from this wonderful dog! Pet Rescue By Judy practices the slow kill method for treating heartworm, and we have had great success with it. The slow kill method means we give the infected dog a medication for 30 days (if you adopt within his first 30 days we will provide you with the medication) and then after that all he needs is his monthly topical of Advantage Multi.\nPlease fill out an application to meet this wonderful dog!",

We do not do out-of-state adoptions on highly adoptable dogs; we would only consider out-of-state adoptions for dogs that prove hard-to-place locally. We cannot hold dogs, please submit your application when you are ready to adopt. PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS FOR INFORMATION ON THIS DOG, AS WELL AS INFORMATION ON OUR PROCESS.\n\nJuno is around 1-2 yrs old and weighs 17 pounds. He was rescued as a stray. He has a calm temperament And enjoys the company of others - human and canine. He enjoys being pet and is easy to handle. He does not object to being picked up if need be. Please submit an adoption application if you would like to meet Juno by visiting our website, poochmatch.com. Open the ADOPTION folder at the top of our home page. Just fill in the blanks and return it via email to poochmatch@hotmail.com. We receive many applications for a single dog, however only one prospective adopter will be invited to meet and adopt Juno.\n\nHis adoption fee is $350 which covers the cost of his neuter, all core vaccines (Rabies and Distemper/Parvo), microchip and microchip registration. The first step is completing an application which is available on our website, poochmatch.com, under the adoption tab. Please read the below paragraphs for more information on our process.\n\nUPDATE: ADOPTION EVENTS CANCELLED DUE TO PANDEMIC AND SOCIAL DISTANCING. If you are interested in meeting any Poochmatch dog at our weekly adoption event on Saturdays at the Petsmart in Yorba Linda, CA (5521 Mirage St.) between 1-5 PM, please fill out an application from our website, poochmatch.com, and submit it no later than 11 AM on Fridays. Upon receipt AND approval, the dog you are interested in meeting will be made available to meet on a Saturday. Due to the high volume of dogs and puppies in our foster homes, it is impossible to bring them all every Saturday. The only way to ensure that the dog that you are interested in will be at the adoption event is to FILL OUT AN APPLICATION AND BE APPROVED. Otherwise, we cannot guarantee that the dog you are interested in will be at our adoption event. If you cannot make the time frame of our events, appointments can be made at another time and location solely at the discretion of the foster parent. Please understand that private appointments will be coordinated to meet the convenience of the foster parent/transporter.\n\nAll adoption fees cover the mandatory and non-negotiable spay/neuter, rabies, microchip, microchip registration, full sets of core vaccinations (rabies and 1 set of distemper/parvo for adults, 4 for puppies) and deworming. Adoption fees vary based on age, breed, size and the costs incurred on the dog's behalf by us i.e. medical, behavioral training, etc. and they range from $225-$495.\n\n\nCOVID-19 PROCEDURE:\nIn an effort to create a safe environment for our potential adopters and our staff, we have changed our protocols and procedures during these difficult times. Starting immediately, our procedures will change from what\u2019s written on our website and other social media platforms. Our weekly adoption event at the Petsmart in Yorba Linda is temporarily cancelled due to COVID-19 and social distancing. The only way to meet one of the dogs/puppies we have available for adoption is through completion of our adoption application through our website, poochmatch.com, before 11 AM on Fridays. On Fridays when we review the applications, we will pick the best fit for each dog or puppy applied for and coordinate mutually agreeable appointment times for the applicants who are approved that week. Private appointments are currently only scheduled on Wednesday, Thursday or Saturday of each week. Masks or bandanas are mandatory; faces must be properly covered.\n\nWith the overwhelming desire of the public to adopt at this time, we have received as many as 30 applications for one dog in just one week. Working with a staff of volunteers, we are only able to reach out on Fridays to the people we have approved to adopt. If you have not heard from us by Friday, we have selected a different applicant. If you have multiple dogs/puppies that you are interested in, please indicate each dog/puppy of interest on the application at that time so we don\u2019t rule you out for another dog/puppy available for adoption.\n\nPlease understand, we have an influx of texts, phone calls and emails that makes it impossible to get to each and every one of you. Not just for adoption interest, but also from veterinarians, people who must relinquish dogs, people who have found a stray dog in need of pick up, etc. We are currently not in need of fosters. Due to the fact that there is such a high demand, we are sticking with strict protocol to not adopt out of Southern California. We apologize for this inconvenience and difficulty to be able to get in touch with us while there is an overwhelming desire and demand to adopt at this time. We appreciate your understanding and patience as we navigate through these difficult times with every intention to keep the public and our staff safe.",

Fully vetted.  \n\nHe has that working dog attitude and would thrive in a home with people that know the breed.   Highly intelligent.  Fast learner.  Needs some honing on obedience training and will be a stellar dog.   \n\nThis is not the dog for just anyone.  This combo of breed wants structure, interaction, place to run off energy and loves to serve their humans.   \n\nMust have safe fenced yard for daily exercise.  He has great house manners, crate trained and housebroke.   Older kids 12 and up should be just fine with him.  No cats. \n\nAdoption applications and information are at www.hollowcreekfarm.org   \nIf this posting says \"adoptable\" yes he is available.",

She is a good mom but her puppies are now ready to leave the nest and she is ready to get her life back on track.  She is a sweet little girl.  She is quiet and loves to get scratches.  She does not have her girlish figure back quite yet but is on the way.  Some of her favorite activities are to go for walks and cuddle.  She loves a good book read to her.  She would make a great pet for someone who wants a.loyal little girl.  Her eyes are so pretty.",

She's a big dog but a very playful big dog, and she's either a very large boxer or boxer and great Dane mix. Would you like to take Chevy home? ** Please complete the application to ADOPT at http://www.codysfriendsrescue.com/adopt/adoption-application/ Chevy's adoption fee is $250, and covers all vetting, including shots, HW test, microchip and spay.

He gets along great with other dogs and loves to play.\n\nHecter has a history of growling and nipping kids that play too rough so we recommend kids over 12 years old. Hecter needs a family with small dog experience that will start from day one in training him that it's not okay to growl and nip. His biggest concern is with crates. He loves to sleep in them, but becomes very territorial when in a crate and will bite.\n\nFill out an application at the link below. Find the dog/cat you are interested in and click the adopt button. That will take you to an application. Once approved you will be called for an appointment to meet your possible new family member, or at that time you can meet the other animals as well. https://petstablished.com/public/search/shelter/301551\n\nAdoption fee is $150 which includes, spay/neuter, vaccines, etc, and a free 1 year membership to our 5 acre ARF Park. For other dog questions please email ARFdogs74006@gmail.com\n\nWe do adopt out of state, but the adopter must travel to ARF to meet the dog they are looking to adopt. They must have an approved application before traveling to meet the dog. We do allow small dogs that are eligible to fly in the cabin of a plane. We DO NOT allow dogs to travel in the cargo area of the plane under any circumstances. Any dog that is adopted can of course go by personal vehicle. We do not allow dogs to be transported \"pony express style\" where they are passed from driver to driver.",

He will do just about anything to hear a squeak or get to play with it and it has him prancing along beside us on our walks and allowing us to pet and interact with him more. His fun side has peaked through and it is great to watch him blossom and come to life!\n\nOrion is a fellow looking for a kind, gentle and patient person who will help guide him along through his journey of becoming a pet. Orion came to the shelter several months ago scared and untrusting and although he has made lots of progress, Orion still needs a guardian angel to help him through his journey. He is a pretty stoic and self contained boy, so you will not see a bunch of emotion emanating from him. He hangs back and observes everything! Orion has spent the last 2 weeks in a foster home and is house trained, crate trained, tolerant of the small dogs, playful with big dogs and would love a female dog his size to play with. He will be happiest with a big fenced yard and space to hang outside in a very quite neighborhood, but is fine to follow you around the house too! \n\nPlease email the behavioral team at kheadlee@wenatcheehumane.org with some information about you living situation and a phone number.",

She is one of the sweetest dogs I have ever met. She will follow you around all day and lay by your feet or stand there waiting for what you'll do next. Because of her level of blindness, she gets anxious/agitated when you're not around, so she will whine and urinate if left alone for too long. She loves to just lie ON YOU and get rubbed, and she'll also jump up on you as much as you let her and just \"hug\" and \"kiss\" you. She sleeps in her own bed in our bedroom but isn't territorial at all. You can kinda just nudge her out of the way, and she's like \"ok, what's next?\" Her personality is always happy/curious. She never wants to be alone so she'll pitter/patter around. She is a great walker and has no issues being on leash. She is fantastic with my other dog and they have normal dog spats where they each have their own space but never aggressive. She rarely barks except when feels threatened or anxious. She also has a fantastic memory and counts steps/stairs with increasing accuracy so she knows exactly how to navigate outside, down the porch stairs and back up again.\nShe is a concern for an older individual because she will follow and lay behind you when you're standing so there is risk of tripping.\nBDRA has voted against the use of electrical fencing effective immediately.",

During Maxx's medical exam, it was discovered that he was previously hit by a car,  resulting in a badly injured hip that needs major surgery to repair. He also has arthritis in his left hock  joint. Our veterinarian and the orthopedic specialist are working on his surgical treatment plan and recovery plan. He will not be going to his forever home until after his surgery.  \n\nMaxx came to us with some medical issues. He has been on anti-inflammatories and antibiotics for wounds and leg pain. He has an appointment with our vet soon to get the x-rays and exam results for his right leg, and to see what is going on in the hock joint in the left leg. Maxx will have some more medical before he is completely ready. If you would be interested in Maxx, please fill out an application today.\n\nThe Animal Rescue Project (www.animalrescueproject.org) is committed to the best possible veterinary care for the pets it rescues and it is looking for adopters who will be similarly committed.\n\nAll dogs and puppies are given a general check-up when they enter our program. They receive medication to remove any intestinal parasites (worms), fleas, and ticks they may have. Dogs greater than six months of age are checked for heartworm. If heartworm positive, the Animal Rescue Project treats the disease. Dogs and pups receive all age-appropriate vaccinations for distemper, and dogs greater than four months of age are also vaccinated for rabies, in compliance with State of Michigan laws. All dogs will be microchipped as well.\n\nMost dogs and older puppies are spayed or neutered before adoption. In the case of puppies not old enough to be safely sterilized, a $50 deposit is required at the time of adoption and is refunded to the adopter with proof of sterilization.\n\nThe Animal Rescue Project requires every adopter to establish an active relationship with a veterinarian no later than 10 days after adoption. Adopters will receive a plan for routine veterinary care at the time of adoption and are expected to work with their vet to complete the plan.",

He is smart but hard headed...he will need lots of training and exercise. He can be a bit obnoxious with other dogs so its going to take a special dog to put up with him Bosco. He needs a home with no children and not alot of strangers coming and going because he can be protective. When he loves you....HE LOVES YOU! In his obnoxious way. He is a goofy boy that loves toys!

She was a great momma and very protective of them. She was slow to warm up and begin to show trust in us. She is now a sweet and loving girl with no strings attached! She loves going for walks, being outside and most of all, she loves getting attention and good treats! If this girl could be for you, and you don't have cats, please fill out an application today.\n\nThe Animal Rescue Project (www.animalrescueproject.org) is committed to the best possible veterinary care for the pets it rescues and it is looking for adopters who will be similarly committed.\n\nAll dogs and puppies are given a general check-up when they enter our program. They receive medication to remove any intestinal parasites (worms), fleas, and ticks they may have. Dogs greater than six months of age are checked for heartworm. If heartworm positive, the Animal Rescue Project treats the disease. Dogs and pups receive all age-appropriate vaccinations for distemper, and dogs greater than four months of age are also vaccinated for rabies, in compliance with State of Michigan laws. All dogs will be microchipped as well.\n\nMost dogs and older puppies are spayed or neutered before adoption. In the case of puppies not old enough to be safely sterilized, a $50 deposit is required at the time of adoption and is refunded to the adopter with proof of sterilization.\n\nThe Animal Rescue Project requires every adopter to establish an active relationship with a veterinarian no later than 10 days after adoption. Adopters will receive a plan for routine veterinary care at the time of adoption and are expected to work with their vet to complete the plan.",

            "description": "Hiiiii! My name is Chaplin aka Chappy! I am a 2 year old Dogo Argentino that is looking to find my forever home! I\u2019m a big goofball and still working on my manners.\n\nIt would be best for my new family to continue training with a professional as I\u2019m really silly and kind of a clown.\n\nI recently completed my heart worm treatment and now slowly I am getting exposed to more things. I seem to be interested in cats but a proper introduction may be best. I am around other dogs but seem to do better with lady dogs.\n\nI\u2019m working on my introductions with people as I\u2019m kind of judgey.. some people I just love right away others I need to be around you for a little bit. I\u2019m not aggressive just vocalize my opinion.\n\nI seem to warm up to woman quickly but some men I want to get to know more over a little bit of time. I am an awesome eater and do not turn down my food or snacks. I am a giant love bug and looking for someone who likes to be active but also spends time as a homebody. If you\u2019re not looking to adopt, please share me so my new family can find me!\n\nMy perfect home would have a big fenced in yard for me to play in, and no kids under 10 years old - I'm just too clumsy and I wouldn't want to knock anyone down!\n\nDogos are a wonderful breed but we urge anyone interested to dig in and do a lot of research before deciding if they are a good fit for your home. They require a lot of attention and training with them never ends!  Boundaries must be enforced and they often need reminders as they push past boundaires you set! Dogos are loving, kind and gentle but don't mistake that for weakness because they are equally powerful and intense as well! Everyone in the home must be on board with having a dogo and play a major role in their daily routines and training. Yes it is work, but the rewards are ten-fold! Lazy homes don't work for dogos as they need stimulation, exercise, and lots of attention too during their younger years.  Our goal in rescue is to be as transparent as we can about each and every dog plus make sure new families really understand the needs of a dogo!",

Check them out! **\n\nNoelia was found on the border of Texas and Mexico in September 2019 in a cemetery where she had been dumped with her 4 nursing babies :( When she was first rescued, Noelia had a spinal injury that left her paralyzed in her hind end. She had no use of her hind legs. Sadly, she was not producing milk and her babies did not make it. SNARR put her on transport to NY and one week later she had surgery by a top orthopedic surgeon to fix her spine. Within a week of her surgery, she was standing with assistance and by week 2, she started hydro and physical therapy. By week 5, this amazingly resilient girl was RUNNING! \n\nNoelia is a sweet, gentle soul. She didn't know how to be a dog when she was first rescued. Beds, toys and treats were like wonders to her. She used to ask permission to take a toy, but now she just goes for it. Watching her blossom has been incredible! It does take her a minute to warm up to new people and surroundings, but once she knows she's safe she is a happy, loving little girl! She will come to you for affection and loves her head scratched. She is learning how to play and is quite the goof when she is in the mood! She loves toys, and loves to be outside exploring more than anything else. She likes other dogs, especially those who will play with her. She's not shy about food at all! At mealtime, she bolts to her specific spot in the kitchen, sits and wait her turn. No one taught her this -- she just watched what the other dogs did and is a quick study! She is super smart, gentle, and would be great with a patient family who understands she is a bit shy and needs help to bring her out of her shell.\n\nNoelia's ideal home: Noelia will need a family who knows she is still becoming the dog she was meant to be; one that will continue to keep her active to maintain the physical progress she's made, and also who will help her continue to heal emotionally from her past life on the streets. No small children, please. We feel they are too wild for her comfort. She will never bite or snap, ever, but we know she'd do best in a calmer environment. Noelia must have a home with another friendly, female, confident pup and a fenced in yard. She is a remarkable girl with a remarkable story of recovery. \n\nTo apply to adopt Noelia, fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. \n**Meet and greets will not be scheduled without an approved application.**\n\n*Health: up to date on required vaccines, spayed, microchipped. Noelia was hind-end paralyzed when she was first rescued in 2019, but spinal surgery helped her regain feeling in her hind legs and she is completely mobile now! However she does need her bladder expressed daily as a result of her original spinal injury. Her foster mom will happily show any adopter how to do this, as it's pretty simple!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $375 for adults. Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n\n\n",

            "description": "If this listing is still posted, we are still accepting applications for him/her. We do not do out-of-state adoptions on highly adoptable dogs; we would only consider out-of-state adoptions for dogs that prove hard-to-place locally. We cannot hold dogs, please submit your application when you are ready to adopt. PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS FOR INFORMATION ON THIS DOG, AS WELL AS INFORMATION ON OUR PROCESS.\n\nGobi is around 10-11 months old and weighs 36 pounds. He is estimated to gain no more than 5 pounds to be at his full-grown weight. He was rescued with his mom, Olivia (also available for adoption) and sister Mojave (who has since been adopted). He is sociable with other dogs and loves to meet new canine companions. He is shy at first and requires some confidence building. Once he adjusts, he is a very loving companion. He will embrace affection and become the happy puppy we know him to be -- he just needs some time and patience to get there. He would be good with calmer, mature kids over the age of 10 years old. His adoption fee is $385 which covers the cost of his neuter, all core vaccines (Rabies and Distemper/Parvo), microchip and microchip registration. The first step is completing an application which is available on our website, poochmatch.com, under the adoption tab. Please read the below paragraphs for more information on our process.\n\nUPDATE: ADOPTION EVENTS CANCELLED DUE TO PANDEMIC AND SOCIAL DISTANCING. If you are interested in meeting any Poochmatch dog at our weekly adoption event on Saturdays at the Petsmart in Yorba Linda, CA (5521 Mirage St.) between 1-5 PM, please fill out an application from our website, poochmatch.com, and submit it no later than 11 AM on Fridays. Upon receipt AND approval, the dog you are interested in meeting will be made available to meet on a Saturday. Due to the high volume of dogs and puppies in our foster homes, it is impossible to bring them all every Saturday. The only way to ensure that the dog that you are interested in will be at the adoption event is to FILL OUT AN APPLICATION AND BE APPROVED. Otherwise, we cannot guarantee that the dog you are interested in will be at our adoption event. If you cannot make the time frame of our events, appointments can be made at another time and location solely at the discretion of the foster parent. Please understand that private appointments will be coordinated to meet the convenience of the foster parent/transporter.\n\nAll adoption fees cover the mandatory and non-negotiable spay/neuter, rabies, microchip, microchip registration, full sets of core vaccinations (rabies and 1 set of distemper/parvo for adults, 4 for puppies) and deworming. Adoption fees vary based on age, breed, size and the costs incurred on the dog's behalf by us i.e. medical, behavioral training, etc. and they range from $225-$495.\n\n\nCOVID-19 PROCEDURE:\nIn an effort to create a safe environment for our potential adopters and our staff, we have changed our protocols and procedures during these difficult times. Starting immediately, our procedures will change from what\u2019s written on our website and other social media platforms. Our weekly adoption event at the Petsmart in Yorba Linda is temporarily cancelled due to COVID-19 and social distancing. The only way to meet one of the dogs/puppies we have available for adoption is through completion of our adoption application through our website, poochmatch.com, before 11 AM on Fridays. On Fridays when we review the applications, we will pick the best fit for each dog or puppy applied for and coordinate mutually agreeable appointment times for the applicants who are approved that week. Private appointments are currently only scheduled on Wednesday, Thursday or Saturday of each week. Masks or bandanas are mandatory; faces must be properly covered.\n\nWith the overwhelming desire of the public to adopt at this time, we have received as many as 30 applications for one dog in just one week. Working with a staff of volunteers, we are only able to reach out on Fridays to the people we have approved to adopt. If you have not heard from us by Friday, we have selected a different applicant. If you have multiple dogs/puppies that you are interested in, please indicate each dog/puppy of interest on the application at that time so we don\u2019t rule you out for another dog/puppy available for adoption.\n\nPlease understand, we have an influx of texts, phone calls and emails that makes it impossible to get to each and every one of you. Not just for adoption interest, but also from veterinarians, people who must relinquish dogs, people who have found a stray dog in need of pick up, etc. We are currently not in need of fosters. Due to the fact that there is such a high demand, we are sticking with strict protocol to not adopt out of Southern California. We apologize for this inconvenience and difficulty to be able to get in touch with us while there is an overwhelming desire and demand to adopt at this time. We appreciate your understanding and patience as we navigate through these difficult times with every intention to keep the public and our staff safe.",

She is great with children 8 and older, as well as other dogs who respect her personal space. Because she has street smarts, she doesn't like to share her food, toys, or bed. She would thrive in a home where her boundaries can be respected.\n\nFrida is spayed, up to date on shots and microchipped. She is also crate trained, working on leash training, and she has shown no aggression towards children. Frida is currently being fostered in Houston, TX. We have adopted to many happy families in your area and can provide references.

            "description": "Asher, Opal and Raven are shy Labrador mixes looking for a special angel to give them the home they have never known.  Most of their previous life was spent outside without much human interaction.  Now that they have come into our care, all have blossomed.  Asher is almost two years old and the mother of nine month old daughters, Opal and Raven.  All are medium sized dogs that weigh less than thirty pounds.  This is a bonded tight-knit family that loves each other very much.  Asher, Opal and Raven do best when they are together.  Consequently, we are hoping to adopt them to the same family.  These pups are looking for a simple life with a family that enjoys life in the slow lane.  They need a calm quiet household without a lot of people coming and going.  An adult home or one with older children would be best.  These girls are really very sweet but quite timid and reserved.  They are perfectly content to go about their day as you do whatever it is you need to do.  Most of the time, you will find them curled up together for a nap or taking turns with a chew toy.  They are quiet, well behaved, and housebroken if kept on a schedule.  None are really into walks, but they will follow you out nicely to their own fenced in backyard.  They love running around together and spending some time outside exploring.  Over time, we introduced other calm well-balanced dogs to their play group and all have responded well.  Another confident stable dog may be a benefit in their new home to help them adjust.  Don\u2019t expect this bunch to run up to greet you when you walk in the door.  They are just not into hugs and kisses.  A good meal, a warm bed, and a soft gentle voice to tell them they are loved are all they require.  They really are quite easy to please.  If you have room in your family for three dogs, please consider Asher, Opal and Raven.  It would really warm our hearts to see them in a forever home of their own.  \n\nTo adopt this pet, Click \"More About Us\" and then \"Adoption Application\" to be directed to our online HSNWGA application form.  You will be contacted by our Adoption Coordinator once your application is reviewed and approved.  Due to high volume of applications, we are only able to contact those applicants that best meet the needs of that individual pet.",

Due to an infection as well as malnourishing living conditions, mama Frida lost all 8 babies within 12 hrs of coming to us. \n\nShe has now healed and is full of energy and life. She is great with children 8 and older, as well as other dogs who respect her personal space. Because she has street smarts, she doesn't like to share her food, toys, or bed. She would thrive in a home where her boundaries can be respected.\n\nFrida is spayed, up to date on shots and microchipped. She is also crate trained, working on leash training, and she has shown no aggression towards children. Frida is currently being fostered in Houston, TX. We have adopted to many happy families in your area and can provide references. We use an amazing ground transport that goes to your area twice a month.\n\nIf you feel all of these needs fit your lifestyle please fill out an application on our website www.goodlif3bullyrescue.org/adoption-application-1 or feel free to email goodlif3adoptions@gmail.com.",

I'm a couch potato for sure!\n\nI do well with other dogs, though puppies and small dogs aren't a good match for me because of their high energy levels!

But no kids under 8 years old - just because of my size and their energy level!\n\nI am heartworm negative, spayed, and am up to date with vaccinations.

Rosie has not had any issues with cats or other dogs in her foster home and is house trained, loves children and just needs a wonderful loving home.\n\nRosie weighs approximately 50 pounds and her main caretaker is her favorite eight year old in the home! She absolutely adores children. She does pull on the leash a bit but a bit of training can get her moving in the right direction on that! \n\nIf you want a loving pup to hang out with you on the sofa or in your recliner .... Rosie is your girl! She would truly prefer to be the only dog but does live with other dogs in her foster home. It would be best for Rosie to live with a low key dog. \n\nRosie came in heartworm positive and she is being treated with the slow kill method. She is doing great and has recently lost the extra weight she had coming into her foster home.",

As far as being with other dogs, if they are big dogs then they have to show that they are nice and he will be nice too, but if they aren't he gets protective. Rocky LOVES all people, hes honestly an easy dog, he just likes to hang out and be next to you! He loves to cuddle and wants to always sleep right next to you. He has a silly personality and will do anything for a treat!!\n\nHe\u2019s 2 years old, neutered, has all of his shots, and is microchipped. Please fill out an application at www.goodlif3bullyrescue.org/adoption-application-1  or send us an email to goodlif3adoptions@gmail.com if interested in Rocky.",

He means well but is just a bit timid at first. His personality will blossom in a nice home though. He's got a big smile and will wag his tail for treats! \n\nHe is comfortable with other dogs but if a large dog is too forward then he quickly becomes intimidated and will grumble. He is not a fan of a crate and on the flip side, is so excited for treats that he will eagerly grab them. This may not be safe with children and food but he has yet to be around young ones. \n\nGomez came to us from Hitchcock Road Animal Shelter. He was all set to get adopted through them but sadly his adopters fell through to no fault of Gomez's. We're happy he gets to come hang out with us!",

To see if we are having a Sunday event you must visit our FACEBOOK page the morning of Sunday. You MUST submit an APPLICATION via email in hopes to get an appointment, our application is found on our website lovejoyfoundation.org. If you do not get a phone call by Friday then we did not have anything available for you or the pet of interest was adopted before we got you application.PLEASE UNDERSTAND sending an inquiry through any site other than submitting an application through lovejoyfoundation.org IS NOT an application for the dog/puppy/ or kitten you're interested in, as it is JUST an INQUIRY. We are a Southern California based rescue, we do not adopt out more than a 30 minute radius. We appreciate you being understanding and Patient as we attempt to go back to a new normal.",

I'm a husky which means I get very vocal when excited or anxious. I also enjoy barking at strangers when out for a stroll. My ideal home would be free of children and small animals. I'm not overly excited about other dogs, but would probably do fine with one if they respect my space. I would love to be in a house with a fenced in yard in a quiet neighbourhood. It would be nice if my humans are active and have large breed experience. If you're interested in meeting my, please contact Vaughan Animal Services to set up an appointment.",

He is happy, outgoing, social and just wonderful. Cooper does not do things at half speed. He is a smart, quick, rambunctious dog. He will need VERY slow intros but better to be the only dog.

Please visit http://www.caninelifeline.org/adoption-process/ for more information about our adoption process and to submit an online application.\n\nTitus is a very handsome 5 year-old Black Lab who was surrendered by his family along with Sadie, a 3 year-old Chocolate Lab, when they could no longer care for them. In their previous home, Titus and Sadie lived outdoors and slept in a doghouse. Fortunately for them, those days are over and they will be living in comfy indoor homes from now on. True to his breed, Titus is a very friendly and outgoing dog who loves to play with his human friends but doesn't usually realize how big he is. At 90+ pounds, when this boy starts jumping for joy, it's a sight to behold. Titus does sit nicely for a treat so should be able to learn lots more in his new home as he's very food-motivated. Since coming to Canine Lifeline, he has done extremely well with crate-training and keeps his crate spotless. With continued crate-training and some consistent positive direction on the part of his new family, he should have the housetraining routine in his new home mastered without too much trouble. Titus has not had a lot of experience on a leash yet so would benefit from using an Easy Walk Harness as he works on his leash skills. He's a very eager to please guy who needs lots of exercise and some direction from his new family. Titus lived with kids in his previous home and did well with them although given his size and exuberance, he knocked them over on a regular basis. Titus has gotten along well with all other dogs he's met since coming to us. Although he lived with Sadie previously, Titus and Sadie do not need to be adopted together although they would make a great pair for the Lab lover looking for two active dogs. Titus weighs about 90 pounds and his adoption fee is $350. He's neutered, heartworm negative and on monthly preventative, up to date on vaccinations including bivalent canine influenza, wormed, on flea and tick preventative, and microchipped. As part of the adoption process, all adopters must commit to a two-week adjustment period to make sure it's a great match before the adoption is finalized. Please email info@caninelifeline.org if you're interested in Titus. An approved application is required before we schedule meets with any of our dogs. Please note that we don't place our dogs in homes with children under 7 years of age. We correspond via email so please check your junkmail or spam folder to make sure our reply hasn't landed in there. Please visit our website at www.caninelifeline.org to see more photos of Titus and to submit an online application if you live in Northeast OH.",

I came to the rescue with Buster who was adopted and living his happily ever after life after our owner died. I also was adopted but I turned out to have too much energy for them so here I am back looking for my furever home. I am a sweet girl who loves my humans and will stick to them like glue but I am high energy terrier and I do have a motivation to hunt as you see I lived outdoors my whole life! I like to follow my nose and investigate new things and can be a digger too. I have never lived in a house so it is all new to me, so I will need to be crated when you are not around to watch me. I am very smart and learn quickly but I will  need some kind person or family (older kids would be best) will teach me how to be a pet. I have not had much human interaction in my life, so my social skills are not that great. I do LOVE people and I am very playful. I am now crate trained but still need to understand house manners which I am working on. I need to be an only dog, no cats and in a home where I will get lots of exercise and play time! If someone would work with me and give me a chance, I know I have the potential to be the best dog ever! Praying for my home for the holidays. If you would like to make me yours, please fill out an application on the rescue's website www.floprva.org that is the only way to be considered to adopt from this nice rescue who gave me a chance to find you! \n\nLove, \nMisty xo",

            "description": "Luna is one of the lucky dogs rescued from Puerto Rico and transported to Furkids to give her an opportunity to find a forever home. She is a very sweet, laid back girl who loves belly rubs. She is very shy and anxious initially but given time, she will settle down and will reward you with plenty of kisses. She is slowly building the confidence to go out for walks on a leash but in the meantime would love to have a secure fenced in yard in which she can run. She does well with the dog in her foster home and is potty-trained. Luna would love to find a quiet forever home soon where she can finally relax and feel safe enough to reveal her happy and loving personality. Luna P is currently undergoing treatments for heartworm disease. Until she has completed her treatments and is fully recovered, she is available for adoption only in the Atlanta area. She must be able to come to Furkids' shelter for treatments. Luna P weighs 19 lbs., is 4 yrs. old (est. birth date 12/6/2016) and her adoption fee is $300. If you live in the Atlanta area and want to know more about Luna P, please complete a survey at https://furkids.org/dog-adoptions/application. At this time, meeting our dogs is by appointment only. After submitting a survey, an adoption counselor will contact you to give you more information about the dog you are interested in adopting and to arrange for you to meet the dog. Must be at least 21 years of age to adopt.",

            "description": "Lucky is an incredibly sweet 11 year old gentleman. He is very easy to walk and never pulls even with his size. He loves companionship of his people and would much prefer to be around humans than other dogs. He hasn't been aggressive in anyway towards dogs but doesn't venture towards them ever and seems to want to walk away from other dogs so we feel he would do best as an only dog. We did cat test him and he was very gentle with June our cat. He has only had a couple accidents but overall does very well for a senior dog. He loves to take naps and is very gentle taking treats. He did good with my daughter who is 2 and her handing him treats even. He would love a calm environment. No issues climbing stairs. He also rarely barks. He still needs to put on a bit more weight so we expect him to be closer to 80 lbs once he finishes gaining weight.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Lucky, please fill out an adoption application \nhttps://forgottencoastanimalrescue.org/adoption-application",

            "description": "Meet little Phoebe, a very sweet and loving, 12-lb, 4-year-old Chihuahua mix who is dreaming of the best Christmas present ever... a loving forever home!\n\nPhoebe loves people, and also loves giving  kisses. We feel she will do best in a home as an only dog.\n\nPhebe is well housetrained, but doesn't want to be in a crate. She loves sleeping quietly under the covers with her foster mom, and hopefully her new family will welcome another addition the 'the big bed'. She rides well in the car and enjoys walks on leash. Even though she is young, Phoebe enjoys being a 'couch potato' or hanging out on a warm lap.\n\nPhoebe is deaf, and some people consider it a handicap. There are many positives to having a deaf dog! First, she doesn't bark every time the doorbell rings. Then there are loud noises such as thunder, fireworks, and gunshots... no problem for Phoebe. When all the other dogs are barking, Phoebe does not even chime in! She'll sometimes 'talk' to you, but that's when she is wanting something. \n\nBecause Phoebe is deaf, she must have a fenced yard to insure her safety. A family with someone home most of the day will be best so she can go 'potty' on a regular schedule. Phoebe seems to love children, so a family with gentle children, or grandchildren should be fine for this sweet girl.\n\nPhoebe is spayed, micro-chipped, and current on her Rabies and DHP/Parvo vaccines. She tested negative for Heartworms and intestinal parasites, and is currently on Heartworm prevention.\n\nPhoebe's adoption fee is $300.00\n\nForever Home Canine Rescue offers a 3-week trial period with all our adoptions, just to be sure that the pet is a good match for the adoptive family. The fee is refunded if the adoption does not work out within the trial period. We want to be sure that each of our pets will have their perfect 'forever' home!\n\nIf you are interested in Phoebe and think she may be your ideal canine companion, please visit our website at foreverhomek9rescue.org for information on our adoption process. To get an application, you can cut and paste this link to our online application: http://foreverhomek9rescue.org/adoption-application. You may also download an application from our website, or e-mail us at foreverhomeK9rescue@yahoo.com for additional information or to request an application.\n\nForever Home Canine Rescue adopts out-of-state, but we never 'ship' or 'transport' our pets. An approved adopter must come to North Carolina to meet their new canine companion and then take him/her back home with them.",

            "description": "It's heartbreaking and enraging to think about the awful life Mya endured.  She showed up in early 2020 at someone's house in miserable condition - emaciated, covered in mange and fleas and ticks.  That nice person took her to the Vet and she got Heartworm tested (miraculously negative), vaccinated, and started on a number of medications for her fleas/ticks, mange, skin and ear infections. When she came here we continued and added medications.  When she was strong enough, she was spayed and had a mammary tumor removed.  Then I noticed that her face looked like it was melting and realized that her upper mandible was broken and not attached to the roof of her mouth.  I feared this poor long suffering angel had cancer and would never get a chance to know love and comfort and joy.  But the Vet did surgery and believes it was trauma. GRRRRRRRRRRR. She has had two surgeries to close the hole in the roof of her mouth, and even though it is still open a bit, she does GREAT eating and even LOVES LOVES LOVES knuckle bones.  Mya is now solid and chunky and has most of her hair.  She is so funny and goofy and playful and affectionate.  WITH PEOPLE.  However, because she does NOT like other animals, she must be an only pet in an all adult home.  She has great indoor manners.  Likes to play fetch.  Not a huge fan of walking.  Likes to snuggle and wrestle. If you are the person who can give Mya the love and forever home she SO DESERVES, please contact Bev at 804-248-3042 or trampsrescue@yahoo.com.",

All the dogs he's met like him, even the \"mean\" ones. He and the resident cat are friends, when the cat allows. He will eat 24/7 if he can (me too!). He may be going deaf and his sight may be failing, but don't let that deter you! He comes on sign command, he stays off the furniture and out of the trash. He is crate trained and now house broken! He can make it through the night without accident. He lets you know if he needs to go out during the day but it's pretty frequent ... every 2 to 3 hours. He loves the woods, but not water..he's fine with a bath, but would rather not if he can get out of it! Bugsy is so gentle and would be good with a gentle child. He loves to be with someone or some-dog full time. If you are interested in a fun loving dog that has a unusual zest of life and adventure then Bugsy is your man!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Bugsy, please fill out an application today!",

Heartworm is NOT contagious. The rescue covers the cost of treatment at the rescue's vet. \n\nBeautiful charismatic girl looking for a loving home!\n\nDo you love personality, fun and love? Then Im your girl! My name is Baby and Im an adorable 5 year old, ~60 pound, spayed Pittie mix. I have beautiful speckles and very soulful eyes. I love people and going for walks with all the sniffs (and I dont pull unless I see something REALLY interesting). Im an active girl who is curious about everything and learning what the world has to offer. Im housebroken and love sleeping next to my people. I get along with other dogs my size or smaller with a slow introduction, but not with cats. Im very sweet, loving and friendly but am strong so Id probably do best with kids over 7. I am heartworm positive but Ive finished all of my treatments! Please apply now to adopt me; I cant wait to meet you!",

He needs someone to keep up with his training. He resource guards, so no little kids. He also needs someone familiar with resource guarding. He needs to be corrected as soon he does something he shouldn't be doing. He also doesn't like to have his collar pulled on, but he worked on that in prison training. \n\nDarwin is a special freckled nosed pupper. It feels as though he's communicating a world of feelings through his beautiful eyes. He's very smart, and loves learning new things. He'll make an amazing companion to someone who also enjoys sleeping and thinking hard about how the world works. He needs a home without small children (no one under the age of 13) because he gets nervous. He gets along well with other dogs!",

Unfortunately my last home wasn't the best one.  When I came to the shelter I was missing some of my fur, had a skin infection, and I was scared.  I'm all better now though and I'm ready for my new family!\n\nI would prefer a home where I can be the only pet.  I'm up to date on vaccinations, spayed, and I also have a microchip! I love to go for walks and I like to play too.  Sometimes it takes a little time for me to warm up and trust new people, but once I do I'm a very friendly girl!!\n\nIf you're looking for a new furry family member and think I might be the pup for you please stop by the shelter and spend some time getting to know me!",

            "description": "Nice to meet you, my name is Riggs. I am a 1 and a half year old Rottweiler mix that found my way to Foothills Humane Society after being found hanging out at a local gas station. I am as sweet as sugar and a true gentleman. Sit, lie down, and shake are just some of the things I know and learn I new things quickly. I am very gentle and calm and would be the perfect addition to a family. I have been spending time in foster care where I love spending time with my pawrents and going on adventures. Here's a tidbit from a report card that my foster parents gave me: \n\n\"Riggs is such a doll! He is a lover boy. He is usually sitting in between us on the couch or nearby on the chair. He is very calm and relaxed and enjoys lots of naps and down time. He loves to play tug of war and go for walks but doesn't seem to be a super high energy dog. He's perfect in this sense - he loves walks and small hikes and will play but is also happy to relax and be where you are. It's perfect! He does great on the leash. Hardly pulls and listens very well. He doesn't love his crate, but once we get him in it with a treat, he's fine and doesn't make a peep. We have left him in our bedroom while we've been out and I came back to him relaxing on the bed. He didn't potty or chew anything and was perfectly fine. Very impressive! He hasn't had an accident in the house once! He seems to be perfectly potty trained but we are still trying to learn his cues for when he wants to go outside. He likes other people and is happy to see them with a wagging tail. He has the cutest underbite and is so good! We love him and wants to find him a wonderful home!! He truly deserves it and will make someone so happy!\"\n\nI am heartworm positive, but that doesn't mean my heart has any less love to give. The humans tell me not to worry because heartworms are very common in strays like me, but the good news is that I am easily curable! Foothills Humane Society will even cover the expenses of my heartworm treatment until I am negative. For more information on heartworms, read this awesome article by The American Heartworm Society: https://www.heartwormsociety.org/heartworms-in-dogs\n\nIf you are interested in giving me a home, please fill out an adoption application online through our website, foothillshumanesociety.org. \n",

I can't believe it will be, on 12/17/20, five months since you were rescued by RCAPS and sent to Elmore SPCA to meet your new family! I saw your picture the other day and it brought back fond memories of cuddling with you, of playing with you and of the time we spent together.  I will always be in awe of your ability to learn and of your capacity to love. Do you still play with any toy you can get your paws on? Are you still super excited to go for long walks, hikes and runs?   I know you love your ball and your chew toy and am so happy that you get to play with them daily at the shelter.   \nI heard that when you arrived at the shelter you were a bit unsure and wild and would bark at everyone you met. We talked about that before you left and you said you were going to mellow out on that, remember??? \n It's okay though; I know that is hard to enter a new situation and that you like to bark when you are behind a fence or barrier.  I also heard that you tested positive for ehrilichia, but that the folks at Elmore treated you for that. How are you feeling? \nI know that you have been adopted out to two households and it didn't work out  because you are a high energy dog and didn't want to share your space with other pets. I just know that you are going to find the right home soon!  I know that you like to be around people who will give you leadership and who will allow you the opportunity to burn off all that energy! All you need to do is look for a home with folks who love to go for runs, hikes or who have a big yard in which you can run and play fetch!  I would stay away from any homes with cats and other dogs to make sure that you get ALL the attention. \nTess, you are a gorgeous and amazing dog! You are smart, fun, lively, engaging and you have a super personality. I know that you are going to find your new beginning soon. Keep your muzzle up and make sure you sit for treats!\nAll of us have our paws crossed for you...\nLove, \nYour pals at Vance County Services in North Carolina",

Loves to play with dogs but better with dogs her own size. She gets too active and scares smaller dogs while playing because she isn't very gentle (not mean, just clumsy), Loves to be with people, submits quickly to more dominant dogs. Weighs about 45-50 lbs. Has long legs. Hates car rides as they make her sick. \nOur adoption fees:\nFor dogs 7 and younger: $225\nFor dogs 8 and older: $175\n\nThank you for your interest in one of our doggies. Please visit our website at humanesocietyhoco.org and fill out an adoption application or view more info on our doggies. We are open on Saturday (10am - 2pm) every week.

The adoption fee for Mijo & Erasmo will be $250\nBONDED PAIR\nMeet Mijo and Erasmo!! These sweet senior boys are 9 years old and are litter mates that have been together their whole lives. We would like to find them a loving home with room for both of them. These older boys still have plenty of energy and TONS of love to give. Like most chihuahuas, they like to attach to one person. Once you become that person... prepare to be showered in love and adoration! They will follow you like a shadow! Mijo loves to play with stuffed animals and wearing soft sweaters! Erasmo is the more confident brother who is always leading the way and looking out for his brother. They recently had dentals and each had to have teeth removed, they've only got a few teeth between the two of them but hey, it adds character! They are kennel trained and are great about keeping their area clean, we believe once they get a routine and know where to go they will housetrain quickly. They are not very fond of small children so a home with no kids under teenage years would be best. they get along fine with other dogs, but also like typical chihuahua's they don't like to share their space or their human with 'outsiders' so they can be a bit sassy. Mijo unfortunately has a heart mummer, and has had a few small seizures that we know of. But he seems happy and gets around just fine. But he may need more frequent vet visits to check on his heart health as he ages. If you have room in your heart for this special pair please fill out our online adoption application.",

We don't do our adoptions on first come first serve basis, we instead focus on matchmaking to ensure the perfect match for both the animal and adopter.\n\nDOB: 4/28/2019\nBreed: Whippet/Terrier Mix\nNeutered Male\nAdoption Fee: $350\n\nA little bit about me...\nI am a happy dog who's having so much fun meeting all kinds of new friends here at the shelter! I am very friendly, and I want to say hello to every dog and person I meet while out on a walk. My over friendliness can be off-putting to some dogs, and I don't get the hint when another dog doesn't want to play with me. It'll be up to my humans to keep an eye on this to keep me safe. I have a lot of energy and can outlast most of the puppies in a playgroup, so please be ready to provide me a lot of exercise.\n\nThe highlights...\n\nI am very bouncy and happy\nI will bark when I have pent up energy\nI am a social butterfly\nNeeds an active home so I don't get bored\nI need to be provided with outlets for my energy\nI love playing with friendly dogs\n\nMy ideal home would include...\n\nA family that has time, patience, and a plan for potty training. Any dog that's introduced to a new environment is bound to have accidents, whether they're an adult dog or a puppy. I will need my humans to have a plan for potty training and show me where and when I'm expected to go potty.\n\nI am very young and hyperactive, so I am looking for a home that will exercise me daily, so I don't get bored and develop destructive behaviors. These long legs can walk for miles and miles so don't worry about me getting tired on a hike! I have the stamina and energy to be able to keep up.\n\nI am young and have a lot of energy so daily walks are a must for me! I would be a great candidate for a dog park, or to accompany you when visiting with friends and family that have dogs in their home. Keeping me well socialized will help me become a well rounded and confident adult dog.",

Please email the completed application to newleashrescue2018@gmail.com\n\nHolly is a one and a half year old who loves to snuggle with her people and her fur-siblings. She is said to be a Pitbull/ Boxer mix, so needs a family that can keep her busy. She gets along well with everyone and enjoys being around her people. She is potty and crate trained, but may have accidents when transitioning to a new home. She can whine in her crate and bark at noises she is unsure of, so no shared walls or this girl. \n\nWhen encountering new things, Holly can be reserved and may sometimes bark at people (especially in her home), but will stop when told firmly. Holly does become timid when shouting happens and may pancake to the floor. She will need a family who is willing to take the time to bring her everywhere dogs are allowed so she can realize that no one will do anything to hurt her, she\u2019s a very fast learner. \n\nHolly has never been an only dog, so another dog in the home is preferable as she does take cues from her foster siblings on how to act. Holly currently lives with four other dogs and does great! She loves to snuggle with her foster fur-siblings, even when they would rather not. She is in a foster home with cats and does okay with them as long as they don\u2019t run, or she will chase. Holly does redirect quickly and will stop mid-run if you tell her no. Homes without cats would be preferable as she would have the most success in a non-temptation filled environment. \n\nIn her previous home, Holly would get loose off of a tie out and would not stay in the area - she would run.  Holly will require a fenced in yard for her safety.  \n\nHolly is one of the sweetest pups and will snuggle with you for hours and hours, after a good amount of exercise. Are you willing to let Holly snuggle her way into your heart? If so, please fill out an application on New Leash Rescue website.\n\nAdoption fee is $350.00 + tax (no checks) \n\nFoster to contact: Annie @ fosterannie2017@gmail.com\n\nHolly will be at our adoption event on Saturday from 11-2pm at the Woodbury PetSmart.  \n\nOur fosters do the best they can to provide all information about the animal's background and temperament while in foster care in their home. An adopters routine and home environment is likely going to be different than that in their foster home. \n\nSometimes there is more that comes out about a dog's personality once they have been able to settle in a home and truly become comfortable. There are great articles out there written about the different stages a pet goes through after adoption, discussing transitions that happen at 3 days, 3 weeks, and 3 months. We highly recommend reading about this - it will help you understand the transition your new pet goes through.",

Thus far, while he can be forward on initial meeting, he is good with other dogs, humans, and has met a cat without incident. We do not have history with Blue and children, and will not place him into a home where young children reside.\n.\nBlue will do best in a very active, training centric home with other active, playful dogs already in residence. Fenced yard is preferable due to his drive.\n.\nBlue currently weighs 48lbs and is quite fit. He is located in Maryland, we do not ship dogs, and will not be adopting Blue outside of the mid Atlantic region.\n\n\nPLEASE READ our procedures for adoption prior to making inquiry regarding this dog. If you are looking for additional photos, video, or information on this dog, you will likely find that by searching our facebook page for their photo/description album.\n.\nPlease see our main website at www.mabcr.org for more information regarding the adoption of this or any dog from our rescue. \n.\nPlease note that while this dog is currently available, any dog on our site may have an adoption pending and may not be available to you at this time. The same dog may later become available if the adoption falls through. \n.\nOur website www.mabcr.org will give you details on our adoption procedures as well as an application for adoption. An application must be submitted prior to 'matching' an adopter with a dog as all dogs do not fit into all homes. We pride ourselves in our adoption process, we take the time to get to know our adopters so that we can place a dog with them that they can enjoy for years to come.\n.\nPlease understand that we will not discuss dogs with individual adopters until after the application process is completed.\n.\nOur rescue does not have a public facility, therefore there are no visiting hours. Appointments to visit with the available dogs are made after the application process has been completed by our staff.  \n.\nTo assist any dog within the MABCR organization, please consider making a donation to the general fund or to the medical fund. All dogs coming into our rescue are fully vetted (s/n and core vaccines) prior to adoption.\n.\nRescuing animals is quite expensive. If you are unable to adopt, but would like to help this, or any other animal in our system, please consider a sponsorship donation. \nFor information on our sponsorship program, please contact Sarah at SLR@mabcr.org. \n.\nThank you for your interest in Mid-Atlantic Border Collie Rescue.",

While we are unsure of his past, he has shown his foster family that he adores his humans. Cash recovered from serious injuries sustained from being hit by a car.  His broken tibia and dislocated hip were repaired by wonderful  ortho surgeon. He received outstanding care from his vet and tender kisses and rehab from his amazing foster.  \n\nCash is house and kennel trained, loves sticks (of all sizes) and chewing his peanut butter filled Kongs. MOST OF ALL, he loves a soft blanket to suck on (OMG, like a puppy). He will lay (or roll around) on his blanket and never destroys it.  Cash is still considered a pup and will require an adopter with large dog experienced, committed to enrolling him in obedience training. Because of his size, he will be placed in a home with no small children or cats. Cash is currently with a trainer who is getting him ready for his forever home (leash training, basic commands, manners, etc.).   Cash will need a home and will not be suitable for life in an apartment.  HIs adopter will need to continue his training.\n\nWe expect Cash to join us in Maine the end of January.\n\n\n\nAdoption fees cover age specific vaccinations, spay/neuter, microchip, heartworm/lyme/ehrlichia test, worming and transport fees. \n\nAdoption fees: \nThrough 6 months of age $450; \n7 months to through 5 years $400; \n6 years and under 9 years $325: bonded pairs are $500; \n9 years and older $250: bonded pairs are $300 \n\nThis dog is available unless it is marked as Pending, meaning Pending Adoption. This dog is in foster care locally, ONLY if Maine or New Hampshire is listed next to the dogs name; otherwise, the dog is still waiting with our partner rescue for an adoption or foster home in New England. \n\nPLEASE NOTE - We will check your veterinary reference, to ensure that current and prior dogs have a history of being kept up to date on rabies and distemper, have had annual heartworm tests, and are on heartworm preventative at least 6 months of the year. Current pets must by spayed/neutered. \n\nImported dogs are transported on a USDA approved transport with a Health Certificate. All imported dogs are quarantined 14 days prior to getting on transport.\n",

It evokes the beautiful country of farmlands and dramatic seascapes and moors in southwest England.\n\nApparently my original owner did not feel that I was beautiful enough to keep anymore, since once I had my last litter of pups they abandoned me.  Sometimes people are so heartless.\n\nAny who, a very nice land owner found me.  I was significantly malnourished.  They contacted the local sheriff's office, who in turn contacted Lucies project.  The landowner had attempted to catch me so I could be taken somewhere and treated, however I was very afraid and kept running away.  2 very nice ladies from Lucies finally coaxed me over to them while the landowner and sheriff's deputy looked for my pups.  They were no where to be found. :(\n\nI was taken to the vet to be checked out.  I was so underweight that I could not even be spayed.  I had to wait a number of weeks before that could happen!  My body condition was so poor, that the ladies were unsure of when I had even delivered my last litter of pups. I'm only 3 years old and have probably had more litters of pups than I should have in my short life.  I was a sad sight for sure.\n\nNow though, I have a clean bill of health.  I'm telling you, these peeps here at the rescue took good care of me.  So patient and kind and caring, I love them all!\n\n I like to run and play, but most of all I like affection and crave human attention.\n\nAre you like me as well, and just need someone to cuddle with?  Come meet me, I'm sure we will both fall in love at first site!\n\n*** We strive to ensure our dogs are going to a safe, loving and caring home. Phone interviews are required for all adoptions****",

Rescued from life on the streets, together with her sister Star, we are in love with this adorable girl.\n\nBambi is medium in size, with timid but kind personality. She is a sweet and very affectionate girl who needs just a little bit more confidence. She likes walks but can be easily intimidated when out on the street. A more quiet residential area will be best for her. Busy city streets are not her thing. She needs a home with a yard.\n\nFrom her foster:\n\nBambi is a very sweet and loving girl she will roll over onto her back to ask for belly rubs. She is a true couch potato, Bami loves to burrow into a blanket and snuggle on the couch with you. She is a little shy when it comes to meeting new dogs or people. Bambi knows how to sit and is potty trained as well as very food motivated. She also enjoys a good chew to work on such as a bone, kong, pig ear, snuffle mat, etc. Needs to have a high fence in the yard, as she can jump high.\n\nShe will do best in a home with another dog to give her some confidence. Bambi has a little separation anxiety and does not love being alone. This needs some work.\n\nShe is vaccinated, spayed and chipped. Her adoption fee is $395.\n\nWe cover the medical to prepare the pet for adoption and the adopt donations go directly to cover those costs and range from $295-$495. Thank you for stepping up to save a life!\n\nTo expedite to meet with this dog, please go to our site at www.savinggreatanimals.org and fill out an application. We look at the first applications to arrive, so we hope to hear from you soon!",

            "description": "Zoey is a 12/13 yr old boy who is a very fearful dog that we are unaware of his past. Found as a stray our rescue has determined due to his fears and possible abuse received it would be best for him to stay in a constant foster home as a hospice foster with no changes occurring to his life.  Although he has gotten so much better over the past 3 years, he still has a long way to go to feel safe within his foster home.\n\nWould you be interested in sending a surprise to help Zoey's foster parent's care for him? If the dog is over 13 or has special needs we will be including a care list from the foster parents via amazon. \n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/309MB3RCWYS49/ref=cm_wl_huc_view\n\nYou can help sponsor their medical care by visiting http://www.igrescue.com/html/donate/financial_contributions.shtml\nMake sure to list that you would like your donation to assist _____-Gulf Coast Rescue\n\n*Please note that if a foster is classified as Hospice we are happy to let them live out the remainder of their time with rescue. If by chance an adopter would be interested in inquiring about a hospice dog please email us at igrescuegulfcoast@gmail.com.*\n",

He is neutered, vaccinated, and has been very well cared for.\n.\nSean enjoys the company of other dogs, and is well connected to his human. He in quite intense, and while he has met cats on leash, we do not feel he would do well placed with cats in the home. We do not have history with children, so Sean will not be placed with children younger than 14 or so.\n.\nSean is well crate trained, and would enjoy serious walks, hiking, and games training. He will do best in a home with other neutral dogs, or as a constant companion for a very active human.\n.\nSean weighs 48ish lbs. He will required a reasonable amount of exercise in his new home, and would benefit from training classes.\n\nPLEASE READ our procedures for adoption prior to making inquiry regarding this dog. If you are looking for additional photos, video, or information on this dog, you will likely find that by searching our facebook page for their photo/description album.\n.\nPlease see our main website at www.mabcr.org for more information regarding the adoption of this or any dog from our rescue. \n.\nPlease note that while this dog is currently available, any dog on our site may have an adoption pending and may not be available to you at this time. The same dog may later become available if the adoption falls through. \n.\nOur website www.mabcr.org will give you details on our adoption procedures as well as an application for adoption. An application must be submitted prior to 'matching' an adopter with a dog as all dogs do not fit into all homes. We pride ourselves in our adoption process, we take the time to get to know our adopters so that we can place a dog with them that they can enjoy for years to come.\n.\nPlease understand that we will not discuss dogs with individual adopters until after the application process is completed.\n.\nOur rescue does not have a public facility, therefore there are no visiting hours. Appointments to visit with the available dogs are made after the application process has been completed by our staff.  \n.\nTo assist any dog within the MABCR organization, please consider making a donation to the general fund or to the medical fund. All dogs coming into our rescue are fully vetted (s/n and core vaccines) prior to adoption.\n.\nRescuing animals is quite expensive. If you are unable to adopt, but would like to help this, or any other animal in our system, please consider a sponsorship donation. \nFor information on our sponsorship program, please contact Sarah at SLR@mabcr.org. \n.\nThank you for your interest in Mid-Atlantic Border Collie Rescue.",

While she has not had the benefit of training, she learns quickly and her negative behaviors can be redirected. \n\nLuna is a real people lover and eagerly greets our volunteers with happy tail wags.  She is very active and wants to run and play all day! She will also try to dig her way out of her kennel, if left alone too long, so her adopters will have to have a fenced yard.\n\nDue to her high activity level, lack of restraint and her strength, we will not be able to adopt her out to any families with children under 13. \n\nLuna will have to be an only pet because she does not like any other animals. She is very reactive to all the other dogs in the shelter.",

A neighbor took one, one disappeared (UGH), and three lived on the porch of a nice family until they came to this rescue.  They have been treated for Heartworm, and are vaccinated and neutered, of course. \n The third brother, Spot, was fostered and then adopted.  These two are super bonded.  They play, they share, they are best friends.  They are REALLY REALLY HIGH ENERGY, but sweet.  Flop is not only a name, it is a description, and action.  He does it A LOT.  Dot is more shy, but has come a long way since here at the rescue.  Really wanting to adopt these as a pair.  They like to go on walks.  They do not jump a 5 foot fence.  They can dig, but not to escape.  If you might be willing and able to be the forever person/family/home for this pair, please contact trampsrescue@yahoo.com or Bev at 804-248-3042.",

That person passed her along to yet another owner who became ill and asked their neighbor to find her yet another new home. \n\nDespite these multiple changes in homes and people, Jenny is a very Zen puppy. Polite in waiting her turn to go outside and playful with other dogs she meets as well. She has a passion for running, so anyone who runs would find her the perfect companion for that exercise. She's great with kids ages ten and over (too exuberant for younger kids) and has also been fine around cats! We're told she could use \"a little leash work, but she's just a puppy, so that should be expected. Jenny will make a wonderful addition to any active household with a fenced back yard and a playmate.",

            "description": "Mybella is an extremely fun, happy, goofy and energetic adolescent pup, who is looking for a warm and comfy home to flop down in. Because she lived outside her whole life, she has very little understanding of indoor dog boundaries. For example, she likes to oversee any kind of cooking endeavour and afterwards, she likes to be certain the countertops are properly tidy and clear of leftovers. This is something she will need more work on to understand she isn't suited for such an important supervisory role. She is doing much better with potty training and frequently escorts herself to the back door to use the outhouse, but she will need continued reinforcement in a new environment. She loves toys! Either food or toys will work for training purposes. She thrives with positive reinforcement training methods.\n\nShe loves to play with other dogs of all sizes and would likely do best with another prosocial active dog as a companion and playmate. Mybella's ideal home would also consist of training partners who will, with love, patience and dedication, work with her to help her on her journey in becoming the best dog she can be. If you are interested in Mybella, please contact Angels today!\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online. http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.",

Walks nice on a leash but, reacts to bicycles, joggers and some vehicles.  She LOVES her toys so much that she can be possessive of them. These behaviors are manageable and overtime can be corrected. Ruby gets excited & jumpy during play time so it is recommended that she not be in a home with children. \n\nShe is extremely affectionate & really enjoys cuddling either right next to you or on top of you.  She adores her one on one time so much that a home without lots of visitors would be to her delight.\n\nShe lives with a large young male and a medium size older female dog but shows no interest in playing with them...she prefers a dog her own size.  Ruby would also be fine as an only dog because she is all about her toys and/or an outdoor game of toss. This medium energy cutie would do well in a home with a fenced in yard.  The noisy active apartment life does not appeal to her.  Her family should be experienced dog owners that have time to play with her, walk her and give her lots of love. And, in return, she will give you lots of love and laughs.",

He has lost EVERYTHING, his beloved owner who passed away, he lost his home and even siblings birdie and fishy. The toys he came with and there were many (which shows how adored he was from his owner) are literally all he has from his previous life.\n\nHe is good with other dogs and cats but we would recommend he be an only dog with no children as he is being possessive over his toys. This is very likely because that is all he has to hold onto from his previous life and he is used to being a spoiled only pup. With no toys on the scene he is cool, so can easily be walked with other dogs.\n\nHe has been an only dog his whole life and very well cared for so we are not surprised he is really struggling, he is grieving, his whole world for the last 7years has just disappeared.\nHe will make a wonderful dog for someone who can show him his life can be great again with another family. As we said he loves toys and is a master at playing fetch!!\n\nDo you have it in your heart to help out this gorgeous boy? 1/11/21 10:21 PM",

            "description": "Hi friends my name is Cow and I'm a 13-year-old Great Dane / Lab mix. I definitely have Great Dane features but I'm not too big at just under 60 pounds. I'm a goofy boy who is still pretty active in my mature years. I enjoy playing with my human friends and can go on those long walks with you... I'll even keep up with you like those young bucks! I do not enjoy the company of other dogs however, so you will just have to give me all your love... *wink wink*!  Even though I'm not as big as a normal Great Dane, I would appreciate not having any kids too young or small, after all I am an older guy that needs a calmer and respectful energy when it comes to those little humans. I do have a bit of separation anxiety and would prefer a home where my human is with me the majority of the time. \n\nIf you are interested in meeting me, please email adoption@sdsanctuary.com and set up an appointment!",

She seems to be good with other dogs but a proper meet and greet is required. As you can see in her photos she did have a best dog buddy in her last foster home. Foxy is an energetic girl so an active family will be best for her.  She requires a home with children over 12 years of age.  And, we do not know how she is with cats.  A secure fenced yard is required. No apartments/condos for this girl. \n\n\n\n\n\nOur adoption fee of $250.00 helps cover expenses (vaccinations, microchips, spay/neuter, food, housing) for the homeless pets we rescue.  UAF does NOT ship or adopt our adoptables out of state (Arizona) and to ensure the best fit, UAF conducts a home visit to meet other pets and verify a safe, secure yard.\n\nTo start the process of adopting this dog or any other dog, please fill out our matchmaking form which can be accessed by copying the following address and pasting it into your browser.  Filling out this form does not obligate you to adopt.\n\nhttps://www.unitedanimalfriends.org/form/2-dog-matchmaking-form\n\nPlease email uafdogs20@gmail.com to learn more about this dog.",

See our adoption proccess.\n*** Adoption Pending***\n\nLEO is a younger malamute filled with energy and joy for life, ready to roll right over for tummy rubs! In fact, our WAMAL volunteer described him as 'all over the place, so happy, goofy, playful.' He can start off a little shy, but opens up and is very friendly with people and does well with dogs of his energy level and general size. In fact, he would love to have another dog pal! He enjoys playing with other dogs and getting out his boundless energy. Leo knows some basic commands including 'come', 'sit', 'leave it', and 'stay' (when he is not too excited!) and will enjoy learning more in his new home. He needs to work on his leash skills. He is house trained and happily sleeps in his crate at night. His foster home reports he 'seems to want to pretty much always be with us and the dogs as a group.' As expected with his breed, Leo does not do well with small critters so needs to kept away from cats and chickens. To be fair about the chickens - they do taste delicious! Leo would do best in an active home with adults and possibly older children where he can bond with his new pack over some outdoor adventures and indoor snuggle time!Interested in sponsoring?

She is still a pup and - as to be expected - is full of energy and excitement! She is very friendly and exuberant. In her first home she had some challenging experiences, which we believe is a contributing factor for some of her anxiety so may enjoy a home with another dog. With her age, many things are still new and she will do well bonding with her new family with training for commands and leash walking. She is already learning her commands and knows 'come', 'sit', and 'leave it' and is learning others as well! She loves people and attention and will do well with a strong, calm, and gentle pack leader. She loves her toys and her cushy bed and is ready for her forever home. Stormi would do best in an active home with adults and possibly older children where she can bond with their pack over some outdoor adventures and indoor snuggle time! Interested in sponsoring?

            "description": "Apply to adopt Daphne here https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/KGDR/Dog\n\nDaphne is  about 6 years old and weighs 105 lbs. The vet has given her a clean bill of health, and says she looks and acts great. She is energetic and loves attention.  She is very well behaved and quite loving. She is quiet and only barks to alert us. She loves kids and adults, once they are introduced and sniffed. She is great with cats.\n\nWe have attempted a few times to introduce Daphne to other dogs, but she seems to be afraid as well as protective for the family and the kids. The Pandemic has limited  our attempts for dog socialization training.  We feel she needs more interaction to help her to become comfortable with other dogs. Other than that, she is house, crate and electric fence trained. She does very well in the crate for extended periods, such as overnight or when we go to work. (We plan to send her crate with her to help her in the adjustment). \n\nShe is learning to walk with a harness and leash. She still pulls a bit, but is controllable for most of her walk with simple commands and reassurance. She is eager to go in the car and rides well.  She has learned several helpful commands and allows us to bathe her, check her mouth/teeth, takes oral medications easily with peanut butter, and does not bother or eat anything left on the kitchen counter. She does not get on furniture. She loves to play with adults and kids.  Lives to fetch balls and play with her toys. She likes to run and show off in the yard. Daphne is searching for a loving home with playful kids and hopefully a big yard to run and play. She may do best in a single dog setting. Daph is such a loving dog and would be a blessing to a family that will love her as much as we do. She's a real sweetie!\n\nPS. She is a master at getting love and affection while leaning against you and burying her head. We call her \"The Queen of Lean\"! Z Daphne is spayed and up to date on vaccinations.",

Here, he has ignored the chickens and cats, though no promises in his new home -- I'm with him, and call him off before he has a chance to be dumb.\n.\nHickory will do best in an active home that enjoys games, hiking, and long walks, and while we think he would be ok as an only dog, he'd love to have another playful dog in his home.\n.\nHickory is well crate trained, and appears to have been previously housebroken. He located in Maryland. We do not ship dogs, and will not be adopting him outside of the mid Atlantic region.\n.\n\n\nPLEASE READ our procedures for adoption prior to making inquiry regarding this dog. If you are looking for additional photos, video, or information on this dog, you will likely find that by searching our facebook page for their photo/description album.\n.\nPlease see our main website at www.mabcr.org for more information regarding the adoption of this or any dog from our rescue. \n.\nPlease note that while this dog is currently available, any dog on our site may have an adoption pending and may not be available to you at this time. The same dog may later become available if the adoption falls through. \n.\nOur website www.mabcr.org will give you details on our adoption procedures as well as an application for adoption. An application must be submitted prior to 'matching' an adopter with a dog as all dogs do not fit into all homes. We pride ourselves in our adoption process, we take the time to get to know our adopters so that we can place a dog with them that they can enjoy for years to come.\n.\nPlease understand that we will not discuss dogs with individual adopters until after the application process is completed.\n.\nOur rescue does not have a public facility, therefore there are no visiting hours. Appointments to visit with the available dogs are made after the application process has been completed by our staff.  \n.\nTo assist any dog within the MABCR organization, please consider making a donation to the general fund or to the medical fund. All dogs coming into our rescue are fully vetted (s/n and core vaccines) prior to adoption.\n.\nRescuing animals is quite expensive. If you are unable to adopt, but would like to help this, or any other animal in our system, please consider a sponsorship donation. \nFor information on our sponsorship program, please contact Sarah at SLR@mabcr.org. \n.\nThank you for your interest in Mid-Atlantic Border Collie Rescue.",

The family situation and environment has changed and Balto did not adjust well to the situation. It broke their hearts to let him go but his previous owners want what is best for him. \n\nBased his energy level you would never guess that Balto is 10 years old; he is still quite active. He is very affectionate and eager to please, although he is a head strong Husky. Like most senior dogs, Balto prefers consistency through a routine. \n\nHe gets along well with other dogs. loves his walks and does well on lead as long as there is not a squirrel or stray cat in sight. He is quite happy to go for car rides and will rotate from watching out the window to laying down to trying to get as close to you as possible. Like most dogs, he enjoys receiving belly rubs. \n\nBalto is healthy, Heartworm negative, current on vaccines, neutered, and microchipped. He needs a new loving home to live out his remaining years. Give him that chance and fill out an adoption application on our website, www.siberrescue.com, today.\n",

He cares so much about his other four-legged friends around\nhim and he is drawn to those who seem to be struggling. Timber wants to help whoever he can,\neven if he speaks that of a different language. He wishes he had the skills that Tarzan does in\nthat Tarzan can speak to animals of all shapes and sizes.

            "description": "Pomoppossum is officially ready for adoption!!!!  For those who don't know, Pomoppossum is urinary and fecal incontinent due to hemivertebrae.  He has no tail because of this, as well.  But of all the incontinent dogs we've ever had... he was the easiest....and his foster mom this go around (who also has plenty of incontinent experience) agrees.  He is easy to manage a belly band on and well, you all know the story of his poops...he just shoots a tiny hard little poop ball randomly which might sound strange, but in our world, it just sounds easy!!!!  \nWe are so excited for him to find his perfect home!!! We wanted to wait since it had been 2.5 years since his previous adoption, to see who this boy has grown up to be, and here is what we know..... \nHe is not the wild child he once was, but he will need a fenced in yard, wood preferred!  He still loves to play, enjoys his toys, and absolutely need a canine playmate, he loves to play!  He is fun but also laid back.  He is a great snuggler with his human as well.  For all his character and wit, he has grown into a well behaved little man!!!\n\n\nPomopposum is up to date on shots and preventatives and is microchipped.    His adoption fee is any donation you feel appropriate.  Our adoption fee is set to a level to make adoptions happen.  They do not cover our costs. Thank you for your generosity and interest in our dogs!   \n\nAll dogs adopted locally through SGDR receive a free six-week session of obedience classes and a lifetime of behavior support through our Project REWARD program with trainer Charlotte Blake.\n\nYou must have an approved application before being able to visit a dog. Visit our website below for an adoption application https://www.snootygiggles.com/dog-application/\n\nIf you expect to leave the dog alone for long periods of time, please do not consider adopting a puppy.  Puppies need lots of attention and companionship.  Thanks.\n\nAll known information about the animal is listed above. We do our best to give accurate information, but most of our dogs are rescues and do not come with a known history.",

            "description": "Meet Tootsie! At 2.5 years old and 35 lbs, she's a short, but stocky lovebug with a fabulous underbite. Tootsie is a great combo of active and couch potato. She loves having a big yard to run around and play fetch, but is also happy to chill on the sofa in a quiet home. Tootsie is good with other dogs but does like to play at full speed, so she'll do best with dogs her own size or bigger. This sweet girl is also very smart and likes to gather up toys to show off to her humans. But when her humans have to go to work, Tootsie is perfectly happy to stay in her crate and entertain herself with a chew bone. When you get home, Tootsie will jump in your lap for hugs and kisses. Fill out an adoption or foster application to meet this adorable, easygoing pup! \n\n-----\nIMPORTANT: To protect the health of our staff and volunteers, ARF is currently conducting adoptions by appointment only. Please see more information below.\n\n-Contact Info:\nHave questions first about the adoption process or a particular animal? Please click the Contact this Organization button.\n\n-Ready to Adopt? Please visit www.animalrescuemobile.org to submit an adoption application, or click the Adopt Me button to request one via email.\n\n-The Adoption Process:\nAn adoption application, veterinarian and/or personal reference, a home visit, and a $150 adoption fee are part of the process. All animals will be up to date on shots, microchipped, and spayed/neutered before adoption.\n\n-Please Note:\nSponsors are needed to help ARF with the cost of vet care. If you would like to sponsor an ARF rescue, please click the Sponsor Me button. A sponsor donation of $50 will help cover the cost of a spay/neuter surgery. Plus, ARF is a non-profit organization and all donations are tax deductible.",

She has developed some trust issues in her short little life and does not trust very easily and what trust is earned she can easily take away. She needs to go with someone who has experience handling dogs, preferably with experience for dogs who show guarding tendencies. Once she trusts you she's very affectionate and playful, though her rough playstyle will need some training! Care will need to be taken, as she may start to guard people, too. She has a big heart and is looking for someone to she can finally trust and spend the rest of her life with!\n",

            "description": "TILLY IS LOOKING FOR HER FOREVER FAMILY! Tilly is approximately 4 years old and came to The Arrow Fund after suffering a complete degloving of the right back foot. After months of trying to save her leg, the veterinary team decided amputation was the only way to ensure she had a normal, pain free life.  Her foster said that being a tripod weighing 52 lbs. has not slowed her down. She has a bright personality and loves short walks but gets tired after about a half a mile. She enjoys a good game of tug of war and loves playing with tennis balls. She also is good at making her presence known and will bark at just about anything. She is good with cats, dogs and children over 12. If you are ready to have this ray of light join your family, adoption applications are on our website.\n\nhttps://thearrowfund.org/our-animals/adoption-application/",

She came in a little unsure and has gotten more comfortable and we have learned she needs a owner that has time and patience to work with her. She\u2019s needs training and needs to learn some manners. She likes to jump up on you and bite at the rope leash (so we are using a chain leash while walking). She can be nippy with people I think thinking she\u2019s playing but we are working with her on that. She is beautiful and full of love to share just don\u2019t think whoever had her spent much time with her. She has potential just need consistency and training. She is around 2 years old, current on shots, and deserving a wonderful home that can give her training and TLC she deserves and needs. Maybe you have the most amazing FOREVER home for Carmen?! Visit with her today!\nIf you have another dog and are interested in meeting another potential new furry member please bring him or her to the shelter and meet on neutral ground before adopting. No need to shuffle the animals around any more than necessary. Please know that 1 mosquito bite can create heart worms and they can be fatal if not treated. It is VERY important to keep your pets healthy and protected by keeping them on a once a month heart worm and flea/tick prevention. These animals are counting on you as their owner to provide them with lots a love and the proper health care so PLEASE make sure you are aware and prepared before adopting. Owning a pet is an extra expense and responsibility but is so worth every minute and penny you invest in them. They will add lots of joy and unconditional love if given a fair chance.\nThe shelter is open Mon.-Fri. 10-1, 2-5 and Sat. 10-4. Adopt a homeless pet and save a life. If you can not adopt right now come out and volunteer and make a difference in the lives of these animals while they await their FOREVER home.",
