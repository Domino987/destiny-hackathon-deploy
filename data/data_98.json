Very healthy and happy now. \n\nFound as stray in the middle of nowhere, we received a call from the ACO requesting our support for this gal. She was covered in fleas so thick you could see the colonies and jumping everywhere. She was covered in mange and had a tumor. She was so weak that she collapsed as soon as she knew she was safe. She needed an immediate blood transfusion. \n\nPlease consider donating to her care.\nYou can donate at\nDonate www.dallasdogrrr.org\nPaypal donate@dallasdogrrr.org \nVenmo @Dallas-DogRRR",

            "description": "Bella (2008-1504) - Bella is a beautiful 2 year-old girl with a lovely fawn and white coat and\nyellow eyes. She is a pitbull, spayed, close to 50 lbs., and house trained. No cats, older or no\nchildren, fearful of men. It's currently recommended that she be an only dog or be matched with\na dog of similar size with a calm, mature personality.\n\nBella is loving, very smart, and wants to please. She is also very young, energetic but not hyper,\nand has a strong prey drive. She is being fostered because she was very nervous in the\nshelter. The foster noted that from the first moment outside the shelter Bella showed confidence\nand calm. She is affectionate and wants to be close to you, so she prefers to be next to you on\nthe furniture and sleeping in bed with you; however, if you indicate to her that you need some\nspace she will go to her own bed or comforter.\n\nBella should have long and/or plentiful walks and loves car rides. This dog can't just be a yard\ndog; she needs movement and stimulation. Her foster believes she may tend towards\ndepression without regular outdoor activity. Please note that Bella is a big backroller. Currently\nshe gets at least four walks a day because she is in the country without a fenced-in yard. There\nhave been no accidents. She also likes to look out the window and some space should be\nallowed for that.\n\nWhen it comes to other dogs, Bella generally does well. But whether it's because Bella has\nnever been socialized with other dogs or she just has a pushy streak when she gets excited or\nplayful, it's recommended that she be paired with a resident dog who is a similar size, calm, and\non the submissive side.\n\nBecause of Bella's strong interest in odors, movement, and noises, she may make quick moves\ntowards or away from something (squirrels, toads, crickets, odd-shaped leaves). The good thing\nis that within a few times of being redirected by the leash, being told to sit, stay, or leave it, she\nstops the pulling and will come back, but the adopter would have to be on the alert for these\nmoves.\n\nBella has a hearty appetite. The foster found that two large and two small meals worked best\nfor her. She loves treats and takes them gently and treats along with praise, of course, speeds\nup the training process.\n\nBella needs major league chew toys. She can tear up Kongs. So far nylabones are working.\nShe spends time with them everyday. And she seems to understand the difference between\nwhat is okay and not okay to chew.\n\nBella accepts being left alone whether in the house at large, in a room, or in the garage. Her\nfoster has left her with a soft spot, water, treats, and a chew toy for hours while guests were in\nthe house or when she was out for the day without incident. Bella doesn't whine, bark, or\nscratch at the door.\n\nBella is a dog who listens and wants to make you happy. An adopter who loves time outdoors,\nwho has some physical strength and confidence when it comes to sudden redirecting, and who\ncan honor the personality of a smart and sensitive dog will be blessed with Bella.",

I roamed the streets eating any place that would feed me. Now I need someone to love me forever! I'd prefer a home with no children. Once I warm up to you, I let my true personality shine. I love going on walks at the shelter with the humans who taught me it was okay. I need a human who will love me enough to respect my boundaries and patient enough to work with me over time so I can learn how to trust again. Do you think it can be you?\n\nWe suggest a meet and greet with anyone interested in adopting Ludwig. He is a very sweet boy, but has some quirks. We believe he would fit best in a one person home with no other animals, as he becomes possessive of the person closest to him and will try protect them.\n \nCome meet me at the City Of Taylor, Texas Animal Shelter or call 512-352-5483 for more information.\n\nTemperament:\nNO OTHER ANIMALS\n\nMY DEETS:\n- male\n- terrier mix\n- about 15 pounds",

He was wondering in the fields when a good samaritan working in those fields took him and Jackson home but kept them outside 24/7 in triple digit heat. Paw Printz convinced the good samaritan that was not good for them so they surrendered the two dogs to Paw Printz. Now they are happy in the air conditioning after a good play in the yard. They tend to get a little rough in their play so need to be supervised carefully. Placing them in separate home would be best at this point.\n\nRed is still a bit skiddish around people but has come a long way. Listens well and learns fast. Logan Red is about 50 pounds.  neutered, housebroken, crate trained, current on vaccinations and microchipped.\n\nIf you think Red would be the perfect addition to your home, send an email to: PawPrintzRescue@gmail.com and request an application.\n\nAdoption Fee: $200\nAdoption Requirements: Application, Interview, Homecheck\n\nTHIS DOG IS LOCATED NEAR FRESNO, CA\n\n*Age is always a guess with rescue dogs but here at Paw Printz we believe everyone should have a birth day so when the vet guesses at their age, we work out what would be a good birthday for each dog and make it so!",

Please consider donating to his care as the medical care adds up\n.\nYou can donate atPlease consider donating to her care. please consider donating to her care \nYou can donate at\nDonate www.dallasdogrrr.org\nPaypal donate@dallasdogrrr.org \nVenmo @Dallas-DogRRR\n\nHere's a little senior lambchop sure to please an owner who would like a small, quiet, loving senior lapdog. Vieja is blind and mostly deaf. She has recovered from an injury that caused some diminishing paralysis and seems to be doing well getting around. \n\nShe is soft, silky, friendly and calm with other animals, and she love, love, loves to be quietly held. This girl is your TV companion, your work-from-home partner, your study buddy. If she could be in a lap 100% of the time, she would. Well, 98% of the time, because the other 1% she would be eating (healthy appetite) and attending to her duties outside. She is beautifully housebroken and woofs to signal she needs to go out. (She will also woof if she wants to be with someone. Not a demanding dog, but she does like interaction with others and to be in the thick of the action, rather than removed to a quiet guest space.) Recommend a family without small or boisterous children or pets who could tumble her. With calm dogs, cats, people -- shes chill, baby. Did I mention she LOVES sitting in laps, sleeping snuggled next to you, and adores ear rubs? Rewards you with a tiny hummingbird-fast twitch of her tail. She walks with some wobbliness and quick fatigue, but walking. She is a calm girl who wags when you pick her up. Very stable at the groomers, so whatever her history, at some point in the past she became familiar with being groomed. We got her tidied up, mat free, bathed, neat feet and ears and eyes. She seems happy that shes about to have a little snack! \n\nAll Dallas DogRRR adoptable pets are spayed or neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines upon finalizing adoption. The standard minimum donation for puppies is $325 + 8.25% tax = $351.81, for dogs over 12 months the adoption fee is $225 + 8.25% tax = $243.66 and for our senior dogs 8 years and up is $100 + 8.25% tax = $108.25; this increase includes sales tax recently required by the State of Texas to collect. You can view all the adoptable pets and fill out an adoption application online on our website at http://dallasdogrrr.org. \n\nFor more information, you can email adopt@dallasdogrrr.org. Upon receiving your application please allow us 2-3 business days to review and process.",

            "description": "Dune is a 7 year old precious little Shih Tzu who weighs 14.8 lbs. Dune had to have both eyes removed earlier due to ulcerations. He\u2019s such a sweet little guy, and being blind doesn\u2019t slow him down one bit!  \nHere\u2019s how his foster mom describes him:\n\u201c He is very cuddly. He loves belly rubs. He sleeps on the bed with me. During the day when I am at work he is free to explore the house. He does a good job of waiting for me to return to potty unless I'm late. I carry him out to the yard and tell him to potty and he walks around does his business and then explores. I call his name and he will come to me. He knows how to sit up and ask for a treat. He is a happy boy!\u201d\nIf you\u2019d like to meet Dune, the first step is to complete and submit an adoption application on our okwestirescue.com website and we\u2019ll get the process started. \nPlease allow 1-2 weeks to finish processing your application, but please know our volunteers are working hard on it. \nDune\u2019s adoption fee is $150 and is tax deductible. \n\nNOTE: You must complete and submit an application and be approved to adopt prior to being able to meet the dog.  The requested tax-deductible adoption donation is $400 for our puppies, $300 for up to age 7 and $150 for ages 8 and older.\nWe do not ship our pets.  Be prepared to travel to Tulsa, OK, or Oklahoma City, OK, or the location where this dog is fostered to pick up your dog in person if your application is approved.  Once you are approved, you may adopt any of our dogs that is a good fit. \nWe are a non-profit organization that spends our adoption fees and donations on vaccinations, surgeries, various medical tests, medicines, food and supplies needed by our dogs. Our fees do not cover the overall expenses incurred by the care of our dogs, but they do help defray the costs involved.  We thank you for your support. \n",

I enjoy car rides, if you leave the window down I\u2019ll help myself and jump right on in. My absolute favorite thing to do is curl up on the couch with my humans, (some may say I am part couch sloth). Got considerate kiddos? Oh yes, yes ,yes I LOVE those!\n\nThe humans say I\u2019m about as close to perfect as you can get other than I prefer to be the only queen of the castle (I am happiest with no other animals), but I promise I have enough love to make up for another dog so that means you\u2019ll just need me!\n\nIf interested in giving me a FOREVER HOME where I can be the queen of your heart please send the humans a message.\n\nPatiently waiting,\nShiari\n\n\n*Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable.

            "description": "Meet Storm!\nStorm is an honorary doberman in a Weimaraner body!\n He is a owner surrender that was bounced around 3 different homes because no one could keep up with his energy. Storm needs a very active owner that is willing to exercise him for several hours a day. He does have anxiety when he can't see his people but is not destructive but will bark constantly when left alone, due to this he would not be ideal to be in an apartment. Storm will need a privacy fenced back yard of at least 6ft as he is a jumper. \n Storm loves people but he can not be in a home with other animals as he doesn't get along with other male or female dogs and he has a high prey drive for the small animals. He will need a very special home that can give him what he needs. \n\n On a good note this boy absolutely loves to jump on trampolines and loves playing fetch and will return the ball. He does know several basic commands but does pull on leash but if you use the sit command to make him stop he does pretty well. He is a strong boy so no children should be taking him for walks alone. He would cuddle all day on a couch and bed with you. He is not a fan of storms ironically or fireworks. Storm is very protective of his family he will bark at people when passing in cars, drive through and on walks. After proper meetings are done he is fine with people coming up to him. He has been with children from ages new born to 13 and never had any issues. \n\nIf you are an active family with no other pets Storm will be the best addition to your home!\n\nAll animals adopted from us are fully vetted including spay/neuter, vaccines, microchip, heartworm test and deworming. Please email us at HookedOnDobies@gmail.com, visit our Facebook page www.facebook.com/savingdobermankind or webpage https://www.savingdobermankind.org to request an application, inquire about an adoption fee, or to learn more! \n\nWe do require a completed adoption application to be submitted before discussing details of a specific Doberman. \n\nWe DO NOT have a central location, out foster homes are located throughout our geographic region including CO, WY, NM and TX.\n\nWe strive to PROTECT the privacy of out fosters. ALL Doberman meet and greets are conducted in a neutral meeting location made by appointment only.",

Mickey is about 4 years old, neutered, microchipped & up to date on vaccinations! He is loving, intelligent, and would love to be your new BFF. \n\nA home with children over 13 years old, no other dogs or dogs who can match his energy and be friendly, and no cats. He will need a home with a family who will be active and consistent with his training so that he doesn't lose his newly acquired skills! A securely fenced yard is preferred. A meet and greet with existing pets in the home is required. Please share Mickey to help him find his happily ever after! \n\nApply here: thepitbullpen.org",

I have all of my vaccinations and am neutered (and I also got my teeth cleaned).\nHere is my story:\nI was born in the Mexican state of Sonora, but my owner left me temporarily with a relative in Mexicali when he moved to Tijuana. Once he was able to, he brought me home. However, I am a friendly boy and would wonder around, visiting people I didn\u2019t know, so my owner decided it was best if a better home were found for me. My previous owner and his family all took really good care of me and I was well fed and treated.  Eventually a rescue person took me in until I could adopted to a good home.  You won\u2019t believe this, but I went to the store with her one day and while she was inside a gentleman walked by, thought I was a stray and took me home.   My rescuer immediately put out flyers, so when the gentlemen saw the posters he contacted my rescuer and here I am back with her.   I had a really good time with the gentlemen that took me in and was also treated very well.  \nIf you\u2019re getting tired reading this\u2026 you can imagine how I feel!  As you can see, I\u2019ve been bounced around 6 times now! Seriously! I really need to get it together and find a forever home in the USA.  I am a very laid back guy, love to play, am very very loving and a great companion for anyone and I really love children, love to take walks (with or without leash).  I am a big beautiful boy and would love to come live with you and your family.\n",

He is a very sweet, mellow and very easy dog.  He loves to cuddle and is a very content boy.  He is good with other dogs and cats too.  We estimate him to be about 8-9 years old and he weighs 7.5 pounds.  He would love a mellow home with no young children due to his small size, where he can be the center of attention. Beasley is still working on his potty training and does best when he has free access to go outside to do his business or when he can be let outside every 4 hours. Beasley is neutered, microchipped, current on vaccines, dewormed, flea/heartworm treated, fecal and heartworm test (negative), dental cleaning, senior blood panel, thyroid test, and urinalysis.  Please give this boy the forever home that he deserves. If you are reading this, then Beasley is still available for adoption. Please go to our website at www.smoochpoochrescue.com and complete our adoption application.",

Luckily, his stay there was short-lived as his friendly demeanor and constantly wagging tail quickly landed him in a foster home. \n\nChonks does great with dogs his size or bigger but is too much for smaller dogs. He\u2019s also not a fan of cats.. or rather is a bit too MUCH of a fan of cats (and not in a good way). Generally, he seems to think he\u2019s a herding dog and maybe even has some herding in his genes but he is in training now and we are working to manage his herding tendencies. Because of these tendencies, however, it would be best for him to be placed in a home with older children who can get themselves out of herding situations easily. \n\nChonks is a happy, enthusiastic, and playful boy who is looking for an experienced adopter who can continue his training. He is a total goofball who loves toys, especially tug toys and balls! He LOVES to cuddle, but attaches to people quickly, so he will need a strong leader who can help him work on his manners and reach his full potential. \n\nIf interested in Chonks, fill out a survey at www.playersforpits.com/adoptionsurvey!",

After years of seeing this the owner was finally approached and Romeo was freed off the chain, medically vetted and now in need of a forever home. Romeo is a Lab mix with a smooth silky coat, 63 pounds, 4-5 years old, sweet as can be and a good boy that is so worthy. Romeo does great with small dogs and cats. Cats can be all around him and he doesn\u2019t mind or bother them. He is intimidated by bigger male dogs and best to go to a home where there are small dogs or cats. He does have energy and will play and has done well around a 35 pound alpha male. He likes hugging you with his front legs wrapped around your waist even though we discourage jumping up. He has had limited experience with kids but has been good. His size and energy leads us to believe he is best around older kids or teens versus young children only because he may knock one down. Romeo spends his days now laying in a home office with his foster dad lying next to him enjoying the cool floor. He is learning to walk on a leash and seems to be improving, does bark at strangers as they approach, but quickly warms up to people after being introduced. He hasn\u2019t had a single accident in the house considering he was a chained dog. He would love a home with a male buddy and definitely a fenced in yard he could roam around freely when he has to go potty. Romeo will still require patients and love. Romeo is fully medically vetted and tested negative for heartworms (Yeah!) and will be microchipped before going to a forever home. If you are wanting to make a difference in rescued dogs life Romeo is your boy! Go to complete the online pre-adoption application.",

I immediately went to get him and discovered he had been hit by a car and was injured(this happened on Saturday he had been there for 3 days with NO PAIN meds) Cocoa was in dire pain when I finally got him . He immediately went to AMC. He stayed there 2 days on iv with lots of pain meds to get his pain under control. He is now 3 weeks into the kennel rest stage of his recovery for a fractured right hip and cuts and road rash. Coco will want a new home when he is recovered. He is kind, loving, wants companionship and delights in tummy rubs. The FORMER owner never returned any of my calls or emails!  A certified letter terminated her rights to this sweet boy!\n\n\n\n",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.All of the animals posted on our site have been temperament tested. While not all are in the immediate area, once we have processed and approved your application, we will move the dog to our adoptive area for you to meet, greet and hopefully adopt. Sometimes we will have more than one application on a dog. That does not mean it automatically goes to another family but you should be aware of the fact that until you are approved and set up for the meet/greet.. the dog could get adopted by another applicant.NOTE- PETE IS LISTED AS A COURTESY FOR ANOTHER RESCUE ORGANIZATION. PLEASE SEE CONTACT INFO BELOW.In 2012 Pete was at the Raleigh County Humane Society . I was on the Board of Directors there and quickly fell in love with him. He had too much energy for a shelter environment and basically went crazy any time he was taken out of the kennel. I was one of the only people that would spend time with pete due to his high energy. Pete was eventually put on the euthanasia list. The shelter was still a gassing shelter and he was set to head to the gas chamber. On the day he was scheduled to be killed , we , Operation Underdog, got him into an environment with a trainer. The guy took a liking to Pete and said that he would just adopt him. Fast forward to 2020, we see pete posted on facebook needing a home. Come to find out the adopter moved and had chosen not to take his faithful companion of 8 years with him. So now Pete is 9-10 years old. He is currently in a foster home on a farm. He is with pigs , cows and donkeys . He doesn't mind them at all. He is house trained, crate trained , does not try to escape a fence, does well with dogs and doesn't mind the cats. He is a very happy dog and loves everyone. Pete's smile is contagious. He loves attention and back scratches. I would suggest a home without children because pete is very strong and will jump when over stimulated. Pete also displays some resource guarding on things he determines is his. I have seen it with toys, food, a bed, or a chair. This does not happen all the time, 95% of the time he could care less. However, it is there and for that reason, I would suggest an experienced owner to adopt Pete so that when he does display that behavior it is safely managed and he is easily redirected. He is happy to swap a toy for a toy. He is a perfect combination of playtime and relaxing . He would prefer a fenced yard over walks. Pete is a very easy dog and deserves his FOREVER home. He is up to date on vaccines, heartworm negative, on heartworm and flea prevention, and neutered.\n\nAnyone interested in learning more about Pete can email opundo@operationunderdog.org",

She would love to just lay on your lap on the couch all day long. \nShe does not understand how to play with other dogs despite being in a foster home with other dogs. \nWhile she has never been introduced to a cat, it is suspected she will need a home without cats as she does not like small animals (rabbits, squirrels, opossums).\nShe can be picky about her people, having had some problems with certain males. \nPreferably her humans are home more often than they are away as she has some separation anxiety, which has thus far been able to be treated with natural liquid remedy. \nLike most teenagers, she has proven to have selective hearing. She knows her basic commands but occasionally blatantly ignores then depending on who the command is coming from. \nShe is good about not jumping, but sometimes out of happiness (usually before eating) she can get rather bouncy, which could prove problematic for a home with small children. \nShe\u2019ll deny it, but she SNORES like a freight train!\n\nSo please, in this new year, please please PLEASE help Muffin find her forever family. This girl will love you twice as hard as you love her. She just wants to love and be loved. It took months for Muffin to trust her foster mom, so we know she will need a home that is willing and able to be patient with her to earn her trust. \nThough it took her time to warm up to her foster parents, she is an absolute love. Her ideal day would be filled of cuddles on a fluffy surface with her hooman. Since completing her heart worm treatment she has gotten far more energy but should still be considered more on the chill side.\n\nIdeally Muffin\u2019s new home should be/have:\n? PATIENT (this is a must!)\n? Clear routine\n?? No small children\n?? No other animals\n? Cuddles\n? Fluffy surfaces - couch, bed, etc\n\nMuffin is free to adopt to the right home  If you are interested in adopting any of our animals, please fill out an application at www.clevelandareapoundpals.com\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n#dogoftheday #doglover #ilovemydog #petstagram #pets #puppylove #puppies #puppiesofinstagram #petsofinstagram #dogs_of_instagram #animal #pup #animals #adorable #dogsofig #doglife #doglovers #lovedogs #rescuedog #rescuedogsofinstagram #rescuedismyfavoritebreed #rescuedogsrock #adoptdontshop? #adoptabledogs #adoptme #muffin @ Cleveland Area Pound Pals Oklahoma",

            "description": "This darlin' is Zoey. She is a sweet, shy girl who is somewhat environmentally challenged. Zoey is two years old. She likes other dogs, kids and cats. She is not yet fond of car rides  and leashes as they are new to her...as are many other things\n\nZoey came to rescue through no fault of her own. She was sadly surrendered by her owner, who did not have the means to care for her. Zoey really needed a fenced yard, and the installation of a fence was just not possible. \n\nZoey has had a rough life and it's not going to get too much easier in the near future. She was recently vetted and found to be heart worm positive. The good news is that we have raised the money to pay for her treatment and give her the life that she so deserves. Paws crossed for Zoey's speedy recovery!\n\nIf you would like more information about Zoey, or would like to schedule a time to meet her, please contact us at 920-293-8885 or wooflodge@yahoo.com. Zoey will need to have a fenced yard. All of our dogs are current on vaccinations and are spayed or neutered.\n\n",

            "description": "Hi! Remember me? I\u2019m Nikki. You\u2019ve seen me around RCHS for a bit but I\u2019ve been working with my foster mom and she told me that it was time for me to tell everyone how wonderful I am. For starters, I\u2019m a really good girl -- I stand quietly twice daily for my insulin injections and then afterwards I give my foster mom a kiss. I'm also super adorable and love to jump up on laps and provide dog-slobber facials. Haven\u2019t you heard \u2013 they are the latest thing and great for wrinkles! I also really like soft stuffies and will play fetch with them if you throw them for me.  \n\nNow for the stuff that we still need to work on. I don\u2019t like cats \u2013 at all. And I don\u2019t really think that I\u2019ll like children, though my foster mom has never tried that. I am house trained but since I am diabetic, I occasionally can\u2019t hold my pee. My mom puts my in a doggie diaper when she goes out and overnight and most of the time it is clean when she takes it off \u2013 but sometimes I just can\u2019t help it. I look really cute in the diaper!\n\nI have 4 foster dog siblings about my size and we all get along just fine. I am a bit possessive over my food, though (I\u2019m just so hungry!), so my mom just feeds me separately. I will need to have a fenced yard in my forever home.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please fill out our application here: http://www.rchsks.org/our-animals/adopt-a-pet/adopting-a-dog.  By filling out the application you are not committing yourself to adopting; it's a screening process that must be completed before you meet the dog. Please do this BEFORE calling. Our voicemail is only checked periodically and you can reach us much faster via dog-coordinators@rchsks.org.  Thank you!",

Lynx is up to date on vaccinations, spayed & microchipped. She would make a wonderful addition, hiking/running buddy for your family.

            "description": "This 3 1/2-year old male German Shepherd loves to have his belly rubbed, and just look at those big brown appreciative eyes! \n\nCairo is taking supplements for what our Veterinarian partner determined is the beginnings of hip dysplasia. This should slow down the process and there is no need to add prescription medications at this time. He has a different gait but it sure doesnt slow him down and he is not in any pain. In fact he gets around quite well!\n\nCairo is settling into his foster home, and loves being part of the family. He is house trained, crate trained, and non-destructive. We will be introducing him to his foster siblings very soon, but what we can tell so far, is that he appears to be a real Ladies man, even with his cute little bobtail from an unknown prior injury!! \n\nThis handsome boy hasnt shown any interest in toys, as he prefers to lounge in the sun. He walks well on leash, and loves car rides. He will make a great companion for a lucky adopter.\n\nWe anticipate that he would do best in a low to moderate activity home with an adopter who is willing to address his medical needs as they change. Only older children in an adoptive home will be considered.\n\nHis reaction to cats or other small creatures is unknown at this time, but we suspect they would not be a good match.\n\nIt will be necessary for an adopter to have experience in raising a GSD, or other large breed working dog. An adopter who will begin basic obedience training based upon positive reinforcement is recommended to ensure Cairo remains on the path of a well-behaved canine citizen, although he is pretty well behaved in the home.",

            "description": "Eli is a sweet beagle. We sometimes call him \u201clittle\u201d because compared to our other beagles he is tiny. He was extremely timid when he first came to us, but he has warmed up to us now. He still is timid when you reach out your hand, which leaves me to believe he was abused at some point.\n\nHe is tough and will do a little grunt/growl if one of the other dogs comes too close when he is sleeping, but in general seems to really like being around the other dogs. He has never gritted his teeth or even seemed a bit aggressive. He is all beagle. He has a mischievous streak. He likes to sneak the kitchen towels outside and bury them. He will also sneak socks. If you see him with the towels/socks he will bring them to you and give them up if you ask. It\u2019s somehow naughty and cute at the same time.\n\nHe had heartworm treatment, so he has a large patch of shaved hair on his back. He still has some problems with going potty in the house. He knows to use our doggy door, but sometimes he is lazy or stubborn.\n\nHe is so sweet and very soft. He loves to be scratched on the chin. He doesn\u2019t mind being picked up and was very good in the car on the way to the vet\u2019s office. He, like all beagles, really loves his food, and will gobble it up. He uses special prescription kidney food. He is currently finishing up his medication for heartworm treatment and should be done in a few days.\n\nEli's Webpage - http://beaglemaryland.org/brsm_ms/vIndividualCurrentDog.aspx?dogid=69833\nAdoptable Dog Webpage - http://beaglemaryland.org/brsm_ms/vCurrentDogs.aspx\n\nIf you'd like to adopt one of our beagles:\n*Go to our Website - href=\"http://beaglemaryland.org\n*Review our  Standards for Adoption - http://beaglemaryland.org/Home.aspx?pg=standardsforadoption.htm\n*Fill out an Adopter Profile - \nhttp://brsmbeagles.org/new_site/documents/BRSM_profile_secure.pdf\n and email it to us (or print it off, fill it in and send it via regular mail, if you prefer)\n*A BRSM volunteer will contact you to guide you through the rest of the process!\n\nWe hope to hear from you, and so do the beagles!",

Mia is a friendly girl, but is a bit uncomfortable around other female dogs. But she does like the boys! She and her brother were surrendered by their owners to the Franklin County (Indiana) shelter and then made the trip to AAF.\n\nIn light of current events, adoptions are available by appointment only. An adoption application can be submitted online for any desired pet by going to http://www.aafpets.org/adopt-a-pet/. If the app is approved, we will contact you to set up an appointment!Thank you for considering adopting a pet from the Animal Adoption Foundation.\nAll AAF cats and dogs are vaccinated, spayed or neutered and microchipped. All cats receive a FelV/FIV combination test while dogs over the age of 8 months are tested for heartworms. All pets are also treated for both intestinal parasites and fleas. The AAF is proud of the medical attention that is given to each and every pet as their health and well-being is of the utmost importance to our organization. \nThe adoption fee for our pets is as follows:\nKittens: $85\nCats 5 Months and older: $60\nPuppies: $150\nDogs 5 Months and older: $135\nYou can visit this and all of our pets available for adoption:\nTuesday-Friday 4 PM - 7 PM\t\nSaturday and Sunday 1 PM- 4 PM",

He came to us underweight and with heart worm. He\u2019s completed heart worm treatment, is at a great weight and is overall a healthy boy! \n\nJojo is a bit anxious, and would do best in a suburban or country environment. Little things scare him on a daily basis- such as a bike going by on our walks. He is a flight risk, and will dart out a door, or would run if something scared him. I guess you can call him a bit of a spaz. However he has some charming qualities as well. He is very affectionate and cuddly, loves to go for rides in the car and gets so excited when you pull his harness out for his walks. He is eager to please. House trained. He loves hiking in the woods! No couch potatoes please. \nJojo is a messy drinker. He sticks his entire face/muzzle into the bowl, making a huge wet sloppy mess multiple times a day. If this grosses you out- he\u2019s not the dog for you. If you don\u2019t mind keeping a towel by the water bowl for your floor- keep reading. \nA home with a fenced in yard would be ideal. He\u2019s not the type of dog that will do well on a tie out. Jojo loves other dogs. He actually won\u2019t eat his breakfast without his dog friends. He shares his bowls of food. He loves breakfast time. He would love to have a dog companion, but it\u2019s not a must.",

I am a 9 year old German Shepherd/Mastiff mix. \n Even though I may be old, I do show signs of my youth as my younger housemates take me back to my \"younger days\" and I start to engage in play with them in the yard or in the house.  I love to go on walks where sometimes I'll do a medium \"jog\" just to show that I am still young at heart.  I enjoy being outside and also hanging out inside with my Foster family and canine housemates, where on occasion you'll find me chasing them around the kitchen, just like my \"good 'ol days\".  I am heartworm positive and do have a chronic ear infection that was due to my previous owners neglect in taking care of me properly.  Overall I am a super sweet girl who is no trouble at all; the perfect house dog who is so greatful for Cuz i Matter Animal Rescue in saving me and giving me second chance at life.\n\nIf you'd like more information about me, please send CiMAR an email so they can send you all the information about adopting me.

I\u2019m 7 years old and weigh only 5 pounds, and I\u2019m spayed, fully vetted, microchipped, vaccinated, and taking heartworm preventative. I\u2019ve had a rough start in life, but now I\u2019m looking for my forever home so I can make up for lost time!\n\nMy nickname is \u201cCookie\u201d because I\u2019m black and white like an Oreo, and I\u2019m just as sweet! I love to cover you with kisses and sleep snuggled up tight with you under the covers. Despite my age, I still act like a puppy, racing around the yard, wrestling with my friends, and playing with toys with my foster siblings. My pal Andy likes to sound off at other dogs sometimes, and I chime right in with him for a good bark! Andy makes me feel safe, so I\u2019ll need a home where we\u2019ll both be welcome.\n\nAndy and I used to be kept in a barn and used for breeding. We didn\u2019t get much socialization, so we are a bit nervous around new people, but once we get to know you, we\u2019ll make up for it by being super snuggly. We\u2019re also a bit timid when it comes to leashes, so we\u2019ll need a fenced-in yard, extra secure due to my bad habit of digging under fences. I\u2019m working on that! We\u2019re also working hard on our potty training, but occasionally I get caught up in the fun and forget to wait until I\u2019m outside to go.\n\nAndy and I have been waiting a long time for our forever home because we need to stay together, but we can\u2019t understand why anyone would prefer just one dog when they could have TWO great dogs like us in their lives! Are you ready for twice the snuggles, twice the kisses, and twice the love? We\u2019re ready to bring it!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting April and Andy, please DO NOT SEND A MESSAGE TO OUR RESCUE GROUP.  We are too busy placing dogs in great homes to answer messages and inquiries through the listing site.  \n\nPLEASE GO TO THE LINK BELOW TO COMPLETE AN ADOPTION APPLICATION.\n \nwww.chihuahua-rescue.com/adoption-application\n \nCRT requires an approved adoption application and a home visit for all adoption applicants.  CRT transports to OH, KY, IL, MI, MN, WI. \n\n\n",

I\u2019m 5-7 years old, weigh 10 pounds, and am fully vetted, neutered, microchipped, up to date on my vaccinations, and taking heartworm preventative. I\u2019m ready to celebrate my new lease on life with you and my bonded partner, April, who needs to come along with me. We\u2019ll bring the cuddles!\n\nI\u2019m a laidback, low energy kind of guy, happy to snooze in the sun and snuggle with my friends, but I do love chasing squirrels and playing with toys with my foster siblings! I get along great with them and even with my cat stepsister. New people do make me a little nervous, but I am always on my best behavior with the vet and groomer. I am the life of the party when I do my one trick, standing up on my back legs to get a tasty treat!\n\nMy friend April and I have spent most of our lives living in a barn as part of a breeding operation. Because of that, we didn\u2019t get much socialization or training. I\u2019ve gotten much better with my potty training, but I confess that at times I still get excited and want to mark my territory. Walking on a leash is a bit scary to me, so I need a fenced in yard so I can run around and do my business, not to mention chasing those squirrels. Do you have other pets already? I don\u2019t mind sharing my space at all--the more the merrier!\n\nApril and I will be watching for our invitation to join your family, and we can\u2019t wait to RSVP with a big YES! \n\nIf you are interested in adopting Andy and April, please DO NOT SEND A MESSAGE TO OUR RESCUE GROUP.

Kiki and Maddy were not quite so easy to trap but finally it happened! They were both ready to pop with pups so we placed them in a foster home. they were out of touch on socializing but allowed us to pet them and help care for their puppies. their puppies all found homes and now its their turn! they have been with trainer Joe at Bed Bath and biscuit for a few months and they are making great progress and ready for a forever home or a foster home. they are beautiful girls and will make wonderful family additions. Please consider meeting them and giving them the chance they deserve for a loving home. the right person(s) who show them patience and love will be rewarded with true companionship.Adoption fee includes spay/neuter, microchip and rabies and other core vaccinations.",

They were living on their own for most of their lives surviving in a rural neighborhood on scraps of food and makeshift shelter. They gave birth to many litters of beautiful puppies that ASVT was able to rescue and find wonderful homes. Maddy and Kiki were not quite so easy to trap but finally it happened! They were both ready to pop with pups so we placed them in a foster home. They were out of touch on socializing but allowed us to pet them and care for their puppies. Their pups all found homes now its their turn.\n\nThey have been with a trainer Joe at Bed Bath and Biscuit for a few months and they are making great progress and ready for a forever home or a foster home.\n\nThey are beautiful girls and will make wonderful family additions. Please consider meeting them and giving them the chance they deserve for a loving home.\n\nThe right person(s) who show them patience and love will be rewarded with true companionship.\n\nAdoption fee includes spay/neuter, microchip and rabies and other core vaccinations.",

I was surrendered to Animal Ark with my brother, Max. I need to go to a home without any dogs, cats or small children, and a fenced in yard is a must. I can be a bit shy at first but once I get to know you, I'm a very loving lady! I am a VERY smart dog and I know lots of commands. I love playing tug-of-war with my rope toy. I am looking for an owner who has experience with abused and fear aggression animals. If you think you can open your home to me, contact the shelter!",

He particularly loves rolling the large red plastic ball around in our play yard and enjoys chasing tennis balls to play fetch but doesn't quite understand that you have to give it back to the 'thrower'. He would love a yard of his own where his family would spend time playing with him to help burn off some of his energy. He is quite the jumper, so we would recommend a high fence around the yard and, as with any dog, we wouldn't recommend he be left outside alone for any amount of time. This strong, affectionate boy is only 2 years old and still has a lot of puppy in him. He needs some training and would do best in a home with an experienced dog handler. After some training, he would likely make a good jogging companion or perhaps would like to try Agility or Fly Ball. Bandit is currently on medication for a skin issue and that may be something that will need to be an on-going medication. For more information on Bandit or to make an appointment to meet him, please email adoptions@satchelslastresort.org or call 941-924-5070.",

            "description": "Jax is a spunky, yet snuggly young dog looking for a very special and patient forever family to love and care for him.  Jax is just under two-years old, and he is a little guy weighing in at about seven pounds.  Jax has been working hard at his potty training and manners, and needs a family that is willing to continue working with him on this training.  In his foster home, Jax wears a belly wrap because when he gets excited and busy playing, he has an occasional accident.  He needs a family that is patient, understanding and both able and willing to meet his medical needs...  Jax's front, left leg was broken when he was very young and left untreated so it did not heal properly. His old injury does not impede his mobility, and the leg does not cause him pain. While in foster care with Friends of SCAC Jax was treated with antibiotics for a persistent bacterial infection of his GI tract, which has been resolved. He suffers from occasional bouts of colitis. He is currently eating prescription food for allergies, and taking a daily probiotic; the prescription food and probiotic costs ~$40/$45 a month..  \n\nJax would probably do best in a home where his human(s) could spend most of their time with him.    \n\n***We will not adopt Jax out as an only dog; he requires canine companionship with one (or at most two) other dogs of a similar size and age (younger, active, and small).***\n\nJax has lived with both dogs and cats, and has spent time around younger children.  Jax LOVES to play, and he would love to have a canine companion to spend time with; he would do best in a home with dog(s) of a similar size and with a similar activity level.  Jax has also lived with cats, and wants to play with them too; he tends to chase the cats in order to entice them into a play session.  Jax has also spent time playing with younger children who know how to properly respect and interact with dogs.\n\nJax favorite things include playing (with other dogs and toys!), napping and snuggling, and spending time playing outside with his human and dog friends when the weather is nice.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Jax, please fill out the online adoption application found here (please copy and paste this URL into your browser):  https://forms.gle/ufXh7QCko6EYZga4A",

He was as a stray rescued down south and did very well while fostered there, learning to social with other dogs and people. Once here, our kennel staff and volunteers have continued to work with his behaviors and training, and Jasper is such a smart boy. Jasper would not be a good fit for a family who has never had a dog before as he is nervous around new people.\n\nJasper does go on pack walks and has made some canine friends who he plays well with, he has lived in a home with other dogs and we know for sure he does not like cats. He has also not really had experience around children, and younger kids would probably give him unneeded stress. Jasper is very smart and can take on new tricks and lessons well. He is crate trained. Jasper is hoping to find a FURever home out there somewhere, a family who is willing to take a chance on this sweet boy.\n\nIf you would like to meet Jasper, please fill out a dog adoption application at www.ehrdogs.org & be sure to ask for JASPER BARNWELL!",

I am a 3 year old Bloodhound girl looking for my forever home. When SCBR took me in I was a mess, but since then I have blossomed into a wonderful dog. I have gained all my weight back and my medical report is glowing.  Roo was diagnosed with Heptazoon (americanum/canis).  She may have flare-ups over her life but as of now seems to have recovered beautifully.\nRoo gets along with other dogs andloves to play. She is cat friendly, housebroken, crate trained, and loves meeting new people. She sleeps in her crate all night and even sometimes during the day with the door open. Walks are exciting with her nose to the ground and busy. My foster Mom says I could make a good scent dog.",

I am a husky mix, although we aren't sure what that mix is.\n\nI am a little shy, am not very sure around men, but love women cuz that is what I am used to. I am currently with a trainer to help with my manners and confidence. I am doing great! Look at how I learned to \"Place\"! I am so excited to learn new things.\n\nI am good with other dog and like to play. I would love to show you how gentle I am. Come see me and maybe I can go home with you and show you how loyal I can be.\n\nI am not too crazy about change, but will quickly warm up with a little TLC and patience.\n\nPlease contact\napp@aarfhouston.org\nfor more information about this dog.\n\nYou can apply online by clicking on\n\nApplication\n\n. Once your application is approved, we will schedule a meet and greet at one of our adoption events.\n\nThank you for considering a rescue!\n\nThe adoption fee includes vaccinations, Bordetella, de-worming, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip. There is a an additional $12.99 fee for Home Again for a lifetime registration of the microchip.\nPuppies cannot be adopted outside of the Houston area until they are spay/neutered after they are 4 months old. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.\nNOTE: In our bios, we provide information based on our volunteer's experience with a particular dog; such as temperament, training, and ability to get along with others.\nAARF is a 501(c)3 Non Profit, all breed, no kill organization. Our group is always in need of donations in order to continue to give the needed medical care to our rescues. Adoption fees do not begin to cover all of the medical costs. Any donation , no matter how small is a big help and is greatly appreciated. Please help us to continue to help them. Thank you.",

Raisin adores playing fetch, soft toys and some excellent scratches, Raisin's hair is starting to grow back in too, this peach fuzzy boy had mange and some allergies but he is recovering wonderfully! As you can see, this boy has gorgeous eyes and his best trick is to look at you adoringly and he gets whatever he wants. Raisin LOVES a good game of fetch in the backyard, his energy is high but he lets you know when he's tuckered out. He loved hugs too. Raisin will sit down in front of you when he is needing some snuggles. Raisin is also a pro snuggler, who can be clumsy when trying to get in your lap but he does his best. He is very food motivated, but due to his diet restrictions using his kibble for treats is a great option. Sometimes he will get spooked but new things, like trash bags, moving a chair and of course the vacuum. He recovers well but will need a hug after the trauma. Raisin currently bunks with three chihuahuas, he adores them but they can be overwhelmed by him which he does his very best to respect. Raisin should have an owner experienced with bigger high energy dogs, due to his energetic enthusiasm he should go to a home with older children 10+\n",

I came from a shelter in Boise, ID where I didn't have a very good life and I was picked up by Animal Control there and taken to the shelter. It was pretty scary and I was really apprehensive about all the people around me. I just bonded with a very few people and would growl at the others so it was just me and my few peeps I made friends with. My new friends worked with me and tried to help me understand that not all people are bad. I've gotten better about being around new people and have figured out that most of you humans have awesome treats in your pockets. My foster mom calls me a little stinker and says I remind her of \"Daisy\" another foster she had. Daisy and her new Dad must be really cool because mom talks about them a lot. I hope when I grow up I can be just like Daisy - she rides in helicopters, and jet boats, sniffs out bombs and does all kinds of cool doggy stuff! Anyway, my foster mom thinks I would make a great law enforcement dog - I have a good prey drive and am always sniffing and getting into everything. I'm not destructive, I'm just well .. I guess you could say I'm nosey! Mom says because I wasn't exposed to lots of dogs when I was little I'm now a little reactive to other dogs, especially when I'm out walking. And, because of that darn prey drive, I don't like cats and other small animals. I'm not real comfortable with small children because I know they are just waiting to steal my treats and prized toys! I would like to have a brother that likes me but he can't try and take all my toys or I won't like him. Mom says I'm a really active little stinker so I definitely need a good fenced yard and a human that will see that I get to have lots of exercise and continue to help me understand what is right and wrong. What I tell my foster mom I want is a job to do, just like Daisy has. I think I would be really good at it but know I have a lot to learn. Because I'm not good about sharing food, toys and all my prized possessions Mom thinks I would thrive in a home with maybe just a couple or a single person who works from home and could spend lots of time with me. Most of all, Mom wants me to go with a very experienced rottweiler owner who knows my breed characteristics and can understand the type of training I need to live a full and happy life. I know there is a special person out there for me that fits everything Mom wants for me, we just need to fine them and see how we do together!!",

He is good with other dogs and is okay with cats too. He lets other dogs boss him around, he is very tolerant of them. He will need some time to adjust in a home as he does have some fear issues.\n\nBentley has some quirks and we have hired a trainer for him for 3 weeks, so his adopter will need to follow and continue with his training. He will be available Sept 10th after his training. He feel he should be in an adult only home based on his fear.\n\nBentley is out of training and is ready for his forever home.

I've just about finished my resting time after my last set of heart worm shots. Its been a long journey since I've been rescued by CBR, I'll be ready soon for a fur-ever home. My foster dad is very proud of me because I learned how to drool and have a gassy butt like other boxers do. I love to snuggle, be a silly boy with my sisters and still let foster dad know when someone walks by the house. I'm not sure about thunderstorms and fireworks, I will snuggle close and tight next to you till its over. You will have to tell me its going to be ok. I've not been by myself (except 2 stays at the vet) since being rescued. I always had my sisters around or mom and dad. Dad has left me out of my kennel for several hours at a time with 1 or 2 of my sisters and I do great. You will have to help me get better with boy dogs I still get little too excited. I can do it, with your help. I don't know what a cat is so I don't know how I will do. I sure will miss my foster mom and dad, they have been great to me.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\n8/17/20: Hey everyone it's Niko. I've had to settle down since getting my first HW shot but I still have another 30 days of rest after my last shots later this month. Im not looking forward to the shots they make me sick to my stomach and I don't feel well for a couple days after. One good thing is I've learned to cuddle and I love it. When I was sick from my shots my foster dad snuggled with me and told me the stories from his other Boxers and he would rub my belly till I fell asleep, snoring and all. I went to work with foster dad till I started feeling better. I love laying on the floor while my foster dad watches youtube and rubs my belly, sometimes he is on the couch but most of the time he is on the floor next to me. Im not a big fan of toys but I do love frozen beef bones and rawhides till they get too small for me. My sister Izzy showed me how to play with a kong that is filled with treats. It took me awhile to figure out that my kong had treats in it, I would just eat my sisters treats from her kong while she played with it. I love blueberries, dried pineapple but most of all I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE cheese puffs. Foster dad has been using these treats to help me learn stay and come and sometimes he just tells me how great I am and kisses my head for being an A-MAZE-ING boy. I follow him around all over the house, he has been teaching me to stay while he leaves the room till he gets back. He says it will help me not to follow around the house and that he will come back. My buddy Mason comes to see me a lot and we watch wrestling on TV. One day he brought his brother Luke over. Luke and I became the WDW (world diaper wrestling) undisputed intercontinental tag team cage match champions of the world. We beat the former champs (Woody, Buzz Light year and Mason) in a handicap one fall no time limit match. That was a lot of fun. Check on me soon, I'll be ready soon after my last HW treatment. NIKO, out.\n\n6/23/20: Hey, it's Niko checking in on Father's Day. My foster dad is the best dad EVER!! When I thought it could not get any better, just sayin'. I met a couple new boys since I last wrote, Alston (12) and Luke (3). Even though Alston is not a dog person (I don't know why) he helped me learn by letting me sit in the same room with him and not pet or rub me. Foster dad said not all people like dogs and its ok, I need to practice my manners anyway. Luke was a hand full with all his squealing and running around, I did my best to keep up with him. I had to help save my foster dad when he rides this thing that sounds like a dinosaur. He brings it out in the yard to feed it, it chews up the grass. It must be very powerful cause it goes around in circles with FD on top of it. I run to help him by nipping on its black feet its ferocious and growls back at me while it eats, but I'm not afraid of it. FD tells me that he is ok. He let me sniff it when he put it back in its cage FD calls it a shed. Its belly must have been full cause it made no more dinosaur noise. We have another loud animal I've never seen before- this one is kept in the house in a smaller room, Its not as loud as the shed dinosaur. FD fights with this one everyday, they start on the kitchen and work their way into the living room. It lunges forward and FD pulls it back it lunges forward and he pulls it back, this goes on for 20 minutes. I go into hero mode and try to nip at its one eye in the middle of its head. It must not see to well cause this thing has a bright light for a eye. FD fights that thing all by himself, FD always wins. Then he puts it back in its cage he calls it a closet. My foster sisters are doing well, thanks for asking. Since going to daycare I get to play with all 3 in the backyard. They get in a kiddy pool when they get hot, I'm not too sure about doing that just yet. I'm eating with all of my sisters at the same elevated food bowl station. FD is teaching us all to wait till he places the food down, sometimes I just can't wait. Daycare is a BLAST, I can't believe we just get to play all day. I have to work on playing well with other boy dogs, sometimes I get too excited. I just finished some medicine for my heart worms, soon I'll have to go get some shots. 2 shots will be back to back with no break. I'll have to keep calm for a couple weeks after the first one. Wish me luck, FD says we will be working on my listening, staying, down and come here commands during that time. He says we are going on some field trips before the shots, he is going to take me in some stores around town. Check me out soon, have a great doggy fathers day. Maybe this time next year I'll have a mom and dad to celebrate with. NIKO OUT!\n\n6/1/20: Hey!! Its Niko, BUSY, BUSY, BUSY! It sure is nice to get out and do things, I didn't know how great life was as a D-O-G! I have had a lot of new experiences since last time. Foster dad has taken me to work on the Army base funny place though, they all wear the same clothes and have the same haircuts thats weird. They all love to rub me and tell me how smart I am. They let me watch their classes while my foster dad talks and teaches them how to fix boo boos and ouchies. The car rides are awesome, I love to look out the window and see things pass by, never a dull moment. I get to play with my foster sisters in the house, they are a BLAST to play with. Lucy and Izzy are bigger and younger than me while Bella is a older and smaller than me. Life has been so great with them in it, thats for sure!! My foster dad puts me on a leash and he lets me take him for walks, then I take him home and he rubs me telling me I did great! I get to sleep at night with everybody and I have no accidents,oh yea! Im learning how to sleep in my own comfy bed, 3 words A-MAZE-ING I sleep like a baby. I like when they put me and my foster sisters in our kennels during the day, I get to catch up on naps till foster dad or mom comes home. The Doctors who take care of me are great Im not afraid of them at all, I thought I would be. They look at me with bright lights and listen to me breath and I think its just fun. Ive got to play with some kids and make new friends too, Mason who is 10 loves to play with me. Naomi who is 16 isn't afraid of me AT ALL, imagine that. I get to take her for walks too, WHAT! Foster dad says Im gonna meet some more kids soon. Im learning to share water and food with my sisters, thats one thing I never had to do by myself is share, so its baby steps for me. I had my neuter today and feel little lost if you know what I mean. Foster dad says I'll be just fine as he kisses my head and scratches my belly. I'll get to go to daycare and play with a bunch of dogs soon, ALL DAY! Im excited. Well you can see I've been busier than a one legged cat in a litter box. Im learning, thats for sure. Anyway, just checking in. Check up on me soon, I'll have more great adventures and pictures too.\n\n5/24/20: Hi everybody!! My name is Niko. The kindness of one special person got me out of a bad place and in the loving care of CBR. Her children said you can't save every dog and she told them I can save this one. To that special person, THANK YOU I won't let you down. My new start in life is because of YOU!! My nub has not stopped wagging since I left that place. I am brand new at being a family member and I'm trying my best to see and try new things every day. I want to run and play with all 3 of my foster sisters but I get so excited I can only play with one at a time while on a leash. Foster dad says I'll get better after I'm... neutered? Anyway, I'll be ready for my FUR-ever family soon. I have scars on my face and neck that tells my past but not my future. Watch for my updates to see what new things and experiences I learn!!\n\n_____________",

Sorry for the delay, my new foster dad keeps saying the world is a crazy place these days. All I know is life is good as long as I get treats and a peanut butter filled Kong.\n\nAnyway, I'm finally settled in with my new foster dad. The first week was a little scary because there were so many new smells and places. But I checked everything out and I really like my new home! Theres a big yard to run in when I get the zoomies and a couple sprinklers I can jump through when it's really hot outside. And I LOVE all the attention I'm getting being the only dog in the house.\n\nWhen my foster dad leaves during the day I get to take a nap in my crate with my Kong. He says I've learned to be a really good boy when he goes to work. Among other things, there's just so much to learn. While I may be a little slow, I'm really good at listening and following directions once I've learned something. Especially if there are treats involved!\n\nThat's it for now. I'll continue to work on my good behavior and try to not let my curiosity get me in trouble. I can't wait to meet more Hoomans because they all love me so please come visit! Stay tuned for more progress updates in the near future and stay safe.\n\n6/8/20: Hello everyone! My name is TonksI'm a stocky fella that loves being with my people. When I jump on the dog bed my favorite thing to do is roll around and rub myself on everything. I love napping, but I also love finding new things- I'm curious! When I came from the shelter, they thought I was around 3 years old, but the folks at CBR think I'm more of a middle aged guy. I like chasing the tennis ball but they say that's not great for my arthritis- I'm on some great supplements that are helping that some, but I'm not a guy that will need to be your running buddy. They think I spent a lot of my life before CBR by myself, so I'm looking for a home without any other pets- I like to have the attention of humans all to myself! I also sometimes like to give cats a run for their money (can you blame me?), so I need folks who can keep me calm on the leash or pick me up if I try to bolt for the kitties (I'm a smaller guy, so that's not too hard to do). The folks I'm with are working on teaching me manners and basic commands- they say I'm sort of a slow learner- they aren't sure if maybe in my past life I got a little injured in my head. Once I learn something though, I'm golden! I'm just looking for people who will be patient with me. I'm pretty good in the crate and housetrained, and apparently when I get excited I make little snorting piggy noises which the humans say is really cute.\n\nTonks is looking for a forever home with a family that will continue his training and will be patient, firm, and consistent with him to help him learn his manners. We know his family is out there!\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCome visit carolinaboxerrescue.org to learn more about me and see more pictures.

Backyards AND walks out in the world are a good combo to keep me physically and mentally in shape. I'm goofy, remarkably cute, and I make people laugh. I've made lots of progress making new people friends, and I've mostly conquered my Stranger Danger (too much stimulation and/or folks in uniform sometimes bring out the growls.) Once you're my friend, I'm all about the belly rubs! Other animals are still a challenge for me, and I'm working on leash behavior whenever dogs pass by. Making progress with treat redirection and looking at Foster Mom...one stroll at a time. Excited to work with a trainer this week! I'll be taking notes. Best suited for: a seasoned, assertive dog owner; no other pets; home a lot.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCome visit carolinaboxerrescue.org to learn more about me and see more pictures.

Our mission: To balance the health, safety, and welfare needs of Boxers in the Carolinas (and parts of Virginia and Georgia) by providing a loving and safe environment for stray, abused, impounded and owner surrendered dogs by placing them in foster homes and ultimately - forever homes.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDog's Name: Rosie\n\nDog's Approximate Age: 4 Years\n\nGender: Female\n\nDog's Size: Medium (50lbs to 70lbs. as adult and healthy weight)\n\nDog's Weight: 64\n\nGood with small dogs?: Yes\n\nGood with big dogs?: Yes\n\nGood with cats?: Yes\n\nGood with kids?: Yes, all ages\n\nAny medical issues?:\n\nCrate trained?: Working on it\n\nHouse trained?: Working on it\n\nHeartworms?: No\n\n7/19/20: Rosie here. I'll bet you thought I was lost. Well I was kind of hiding because I had eye surgery and had to wear a very annoying necklace that covered my face. I just refused to be seen in public like that but I'm great now and ready to Rock & Roll!\n\nSince I was kinda just learning before my surgery I forgot how to play but my FB is trying to remind me and I'm remembering how much fun that was. My FM says she's so proud of me because I remembered it's ok to go out on a leash, ride in the car, and sit or down for treats. I love being smart so FM only has to say \"outside\" once and I go right to the door. I wait patiently for my meals and I go out right after I finish so I don't have any accidents in the house. I also know the word \"out\" means I can't go in the kitchen when FM is cooking or in the toy room when the kiddies are eating. I love kids too. When kids visit my FM I like to stay in the playroom. My favorite thing is lying around with my FB. He lets me steal his bones and his crate too. I love having a sibling. I nap in my own crate during the day and sleep in it at night if FM is too wiggly in the bed. Oh, and I just love when someone says my name. I get so wiggly that my tail goes so fast it almost disappears. I'm still shy but when people don't rush up to me I like to smell their back and then I make friends with them. I even let them pet me and I wag my tail. I'm still afraid of sudden noises but I'm so much better. I know Airplanes, leaves and compressors are not going to harm me. Not so sure about traffic and skateboards. I don't mind the broom or sweeper anymore but I like to go in the crate if that big vacuum comes out. FM still tells me I'm one of the smartest dogs she's ever met. When FM goes out I usually go get one of her shoes and maybe a slipper or two but it's just to keep me company. I don't chew on it. I LOVE chewing on Kongs with canned food or veggies though. I chew and bury, then chew and bury some more. I like burying my favorite things in my crate. I haven't worked on anything new this week because I'm just relaxing after having that awful head gear but I remembered all my manners I learned before my eye surgery. I know you have the perfect place for me. At least 1 FM and 1 sibling. More is fine as FM has lots of visitors but I am most comfortable when it's pretty quiet. I really need a crate for when I need to build courage but other than that I'm pretty easy going. I'm not fussy about food but my tummy needs changes to be slow.\n\nWell, I just wanted you to know I'm all healed up and hope you weren't too worried. The scavenger hunt we went on was so fun and now it's your turn to come find me. Ready, set, go!\n\n5/23/20: I know it's taking a while for you to find me, what with the way everything's upside down now, but I'm taking advantage and practicing to be the best friend I can be for you. In just the last few weeks I've learned how to walk on the leash and the last few days I found out there's some pretty good smells out there too! FM is proud that I walk so nicely on the leash; I don't pull at all unless you count the times I freeze when something scares me. At first it was all real scary but now I'm interested in scouting out some more of those smells, I'm still working on ignoring the noises. I love my FB and we play hard when we first wake up and right before supper. He's teaching me how to squeak toys and we play tug of war. FM says I'm like a cuddly lap dog because when she sits down I want to be right next to her. While I'm waiting for you I'm also practicing manners and FM says I'm a really smart girl. She told me my furever family will be so happy they found me because I'm the best girl, so funny and so smart, yup, that's what she says.\n\n5/9/20: Rosie here, checking in. The last couple weeks have been very exciting for me. FM is so proud of me because I didn't have any accidents in the house. She did tell me it would be nice if I could alert her when I have to go out so she didn't have to open the door to check and I just looked at her and said, \"I am\" you just don't know my language yet! I love playing with my FB, I have a den I can go sleep in where it is safe and cozy. Sometimes I just sleep on my FB's beds during the day but at night when FM says, \"night night time\" I run right in my crate. This week FM said I had a major accomplishment because I walked a little bit in the neighborhood. Truthfully I didn't like it very much but FM says if we keep practicing I will learn to love it just as much as my FB. I also am curious about school time. My FB and his GSD look at FM and position when she says a word. FM says it won't be long before I have to perform too or I won't get free treats because she says I'm so very smart. This week I learned that \"Leave it\" means I have to stop doing what I'm doing. It's hard because those treats FM has on her table look so tempting but I love to see my FM happy and tell me what a good girl I am so I just walk away. She said I am going to be an A+ for someone who wants a comfy pal to cuddle with, silly girl to laugh at and best friend for their other pet. I can't wait to meet you.\n\n4/26/20: Hi all, Rosie here again. I just wanted to let you know how well I'm doing. I love my FB and we play boxing every day, especially when we wake up. FM laughs at us and says we look like kangaroos, I don't know what a kangaroo is but I know I love wrestling with my FB. Well I finally learned that the back door isn't as scary as I first thought and now I even go out the door all by myself when FM says, \"Rosie, outside?\" It's a little scary if the wind blows but my spot outside is nice and small so I feel safe as long as I can see the open door. FM gets so excited when squat and I get extra wet food. I tried fooling her a few times by just sitting down but it didn't work. FM said, \"Rosie you are such a smart girl but no treat for that.\" I get treats for letting FM put a leash on my collar too as long as she takes it right off I don't try to run in my crate when I see it. FM said just keep practicing and it'll be ok just like the back door. My FB had a play date so I met his German Shephard friend when her Mom needed a sitter for an hour. We made friends right away and we played outside on the patio. I even forgot I was afraid when a truck went by. FM said when that Covid-19 goes away all the grandkids will come play with me too. I'm so excited for that. I like to watch some animals on T.V and even on FM's phone. I especially like to watch myself play. When the wind broke the T.V. a man came to the house and I didn't run and hide, I just watched him. A new man had to come the next day so I thought I'd just follow him around and lie by his feet when he was sitting on the floor to make sure he fixed it right this time. FM was so happy for me. She said, \"Rosie, you sure are practicing so well it won't be long before your furever family finds you.\n\n4/13/20: That nasty covid thing interrupted my settling in so I had to go to another foster home with a new FM and a new FB. To tell you the truth the first few days were kinda rough, but I am getting used to the new environment. I'm still resting a lot so I can put on some weight but I heard FM on the phone telling the vet that my stomach issues are resolved. I think that's good because I feel so much better. I'm still shy and not sure it's safe outside my crate but my FB keeps encouraging me to come out and sniff around. I'm beginning to follow him a little more and I wag my tail really hard when FM says good morning. I'm trying hard to learn that the back door is a safe place and I watch my FB run in and out trying to get me to follow him. Maybe tomorrow? FM keeps telling me I'm practicing to go to a forever home. I wag my tail and imagine a home with at least one sibling and even a kid or two, the more the merrier right? Now that my tummy issues are gone and they say I'm fixed up so I won't have puppies I'll just keep practicing until you find me.\n\n2/28/20: Rosie here! I'm still very timid. Foster mom and dad still have to pick me up to take me outside. I lived a really rough life before and I'm still learning to trust. I stay in one room and don't like to come out, but when my foster family comes to me, I get really excited and wiggle my whole body now!!! I am learning to play a bit. My foster fur sister and I have gotten into a couple tiffs over high value items like special toys and chew bones (mom now doesn't let us have those unless the other is not around - insert sad face). She doesn't think it was me causing the problem, my foster fur sister is a bit spoiled and doesn't like to share much.\n\nI need a family who will take time to show me I'm loved. I am not going to immediately be a big cuddle bug, but I think in ",

She loves all people and hasn't meet a stranger yet. Her favorite things are going for walks, car rides and snuggling on the sofa. She is completely house trained and has never had an accident. We are working on her getting used to the crate. She is also working on her leash reactivity towards other dogs while on walks. She is able to be redirected with guidance. She does great in car rides and loves to go to with the family to the beach and trails.\n\nCharlotte would do best to have a 6' privacy fenced yard so she has a safe place to play- she has come a very long way but is still quite reactive on a leash when she sees other dogs. She also has some separation anxiety when left alone, so she would love a forever home where there are people home with her a lot of the time.\n\n9/16/20: Charlotte loves cuddling, riding in the car and walks. She is a sweet girl with lots of love to give, wants to be where the action is. Scared of thunder, be prepared to have her in bed with you when there is a storm brewing.\n\n7/8/20: Loves people, attention and snuggles. We love her already and we have had her only one day- more updates to come\n\n5/30/20: Charlotte is the kindest most loving 5 year old. My kids 7 and 1 and 1/2 yrs old love on her and she just eats it up. She loves to walk great on the leash, and loves human company. She's not great with other dogs yet but manages a few barks and moves on with you. Charlotte is her new name and she's learning it slowly!\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCome visit carolinaboxerrescue.org to learn more about me and see more pictures.

Our mission: To balance the health, safety, and welfare needs of Boxers in the Carolinas (and parts of Virginia and Georgia) by providing a loving and safe environment for stray, abused, impounded and owner surrendered dogs by placing them in foster homes and ultimately - forever homes.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDog's Name: Delilah\n\nDog's Approximate Age: 2 years\n\nGender: Female\n\nDog's Size: Pocket Boxer (under 50lbs as adult and healthy weight)\n\nDog's Weight: 47 pounds\n\nGood with small dogs?: No\n\nGood with big dogs?: No\n\nGood with cats?: No\n\nGood with kids?: Yes, older only (12 and over due to being too rambunctious)\n\nAny medical issues?: Heartworm Positive - being treated with slow kill method\n\nCrate trained?: Yes\n\nHouse trained?: Yes\n\nHeartworms?: Yes\n\n10/26/20:\nDelilah has come so far since this summer and we're very proud of her progress! We realized quickly she would act out from anxiety which amped her up and she didn't have the skills or confidence to calm and soothe herself. We also found that she had underlying allergies that were making her irritable and itchy. Zyrtec has been magic for her and while she no longer gets hives, we have noticed she'll chew her paws so consider wiping them down as needed. With some medicine, firm rules, and a whole lot of patience Delilah has come a very long way in just a few weeks. She is showing us a very sweet loving and playful personality. As a super chewer, antlers, Kongs and tough toys have really helped her relax. She LOVES having her own blankets to making nests in, and they are the one item we allow her to chew on as needed for comfort. By doing so we found her need to chew our soft furnishings drastically decrease. Having a crate will always be important for Delilah; it's her safe space and she sleeps there overnight. With time, we've been able to leave her out during the workday downstairs without worry; she just sits on the couch or on her bed. On the weekends we venture to Umstead or the Art Park for long walks. She does very well in the car when in the backseat; she will lean against the chair or curl up. It's important to know that in the trunk or way back she will get car sick. Delilah is learning how to tell us her needs and while she's getting better everyday there are times she gets \"stuck\" or when she steals shoes for attention if we ignore her too long. She also shows some separation anxiety and isn't quite sure what to do if she's super tired but everyone else is busy doing interesting things. Delilah's interest in other dogs is complicated. While she wags her tail and wines at other dogs passing by, she has had consistently negative introductions with them. She walks beautifully and other than sometimes \"sinking\" her body, she doesn't bark or lunge at other dogs so long as you're passing by. We have many dogs in our neighborhood and she couldn't care less when they bark through their windows or doors. But it is important Delilah is your only pet. She really needs a family who is willing to be patient, firm and flexible in the beginning. It's worth it to get to the big doe eyed sweet girl we've come to know.\n\n_____________________________________________________\n\n7/28/20: Hey! It's me, Delilah! I'm just loving these sunny summer days! Even if it's 90 degrees, I want to be outside laying in the sun or watching people walking by. My humans even put sunscreen on my nose! My favorite is when my people are outside with me. I'm right by their side at all times because I don't want to miss out if they stumble upon some treats. While they're working in the garden, I stand nearby and guard em. I also like when they're grilling because anything that drips on the ground is mine!\n\nWe also go for walks which help me get my energy out, but I get tired quickly. After 20 minutes, I can't keep my tongue in my mouth. I don't want to brag but I'm really good at walking on a leash. I stay right next to my human and don't pull. I used to get excited when I saw rabbits and charge after them but I don't do that anymore. I'd love to catch one someday but I know that our walks are not the time to do that.\n\nI'm happy with any people who love being outside, just like I do! It's supposed to rain later so I'm heading outside to work on my tan!\n\n6/12/20: Hey friends! This is Delilah a.k.a Deedee a.k.a Lil' D and I wanted to give everyone an update on all the fun stuff that's been happening in my life! I'm starting to learn the rules of the house and I'm getting better at following them. These humans have a magic mat and every time I lay on it, I get a treat! I'm talking good stuff like hot dogs, apples and peanut butter. I'm even picking up some new tricks too. I've mastered \"shake\" and \"twirl,\" but I'm still getting the hang of \"fetch\" and \"drop.\" If I come home with you, what tricks are you gonna teach me?\n\nDelilah shows a lot of friendly interest in our neighbor's dog (Husky), and may do well with a dog who is OK with a pushy, energetic sibling. She would just need opportunities to calm back down between playtimes, as once she gets overexcited, it's hard to bring her back down.\n\n5/4/20: Little Delilah here, reporting for doodie! 3 weeks have flown by at my new foster home! I'm the sweetest girl looking for a family that will be consistent in rules, give me lots of outdoor time, and has a sunny spot where I can nap. Inside, outside, doesn't matterif I can find a spot of sun, I'm going to nap there! I'm VERY good on a leash, especially if I know who's boss. I get a little over excited at times (who doesn't?!) but after some time to settle down in my kennel, I'm just fine. Other dogs and young kids might find me a bit much - I just want to go go go and don't understand when it's time to stop. I love toys, and dinner time is my favorite time of day. I'm perfectly happy to hand out and sleep in my kennel, I'm perfectly potty trained, I like to sleep in and am not picky about a morning routine; it's just my evenings that need to be a little more structured. Not to brag, but I think I'm pretty smart. I'm a quick learner! In just the three short weeks here, I've learned some fun new tricks, like how to wait patiently for my dinner, \"tough\", and \"down\".\n\n2/25/20: Very energetic happy girl. She loves walking, running and exploring. Absolutely loves her stuffed animals and loves to play. Great with people and seems very fond of men.\n\n12/25/19: Delilah is a 2 year old high energy dog who is looking for a home where she can play a lot in a fenced backyard or go on nice long walks. She would also make a good running buddy! Because she has a lot of energy, we think she would be best in a home with kids 12 and over. She is selective about dogs, so she would like to be the \"queen bee\" of your house. She is crate and house trained, rarely barks, and knows basic commands. She's wondering... could you be her forever family?\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCome visit carolinaboxerrescue.org to learn more about me and see more pictures.

They were left as strays with several other dogs in central Arkansas, and as such have been very shy and are slowly learning how fun living in a home can be.  \n\nBilbo is a sweet guy who is around 25lbs.  He is probably around a year old, but that was just a guess.  He has been fully vetted and is microchipped.  He has been introduced to dogs and cats.  He has not met any children yet, but we feel he would do ok around children 5 and up (because he is still building his confidence around people).  \n\nBilbo is available to a very special home ready to give him all the time he needs to acclimate.  He needs a home with secure fencing and friendly dogs.  He is very frightened by people and has taken months to warm slightly to his foster home.  He is not a take everywhere love everyone kind of dog.  He will not be a social butterfly pal around dog.  He was never socialized or worked with in his early life and that greatly affects how he reacts and the fear he feels now.\n\nHis adoption fee is $150.  He is fostered in Rogers, AR.

            "description": "Renegade came to us in 2015 as a 4-6 month old pup. She was on the urgent list at the Kansas City shelter: \"***Rescue Only - Pup was brought to the shelter by animal control. It appears that she has had no previous human socialization and is very defensive when staff attempts to interact with her.\" Most ferals you work with will shut down, and curl up, and not really think about biting the thing scaring them. Renegade was different (hence her name). She will defend herself and will try to scare strangers away before they ever get near her. She eventually bonded to us and we could handle her and pet her and she'd curl up in a ball and allow the touching without defending herself. She'd wag her tail for us, and get excited to see us but then if you reached for her she'd run to her safe spot (an open wire crate) and curl up. With time, patience, and consistency she will now just cower down for petting, not run away. She WANTS the petting. She's so happy with us, dances around wagging her tail, gives us little kisses, loves treats, but when you reach for her she'll cower down and wait for the petting. The feral dog in her. With strangers, she acts like she's a guard dog and tries to scare them away...but with treats, time, and love she'll warm up to you. Renegade loves it here, she's safe here, but if a skilled, special person was interested in her...she is available for adoption. In the wrong home Renegade would bite someone. So we will be thorough in our screening of potential homes. Because of her trust/fear issues the potential adopter would need to come to our property to meet her 2-3 times a week for 3-6 weeks in a row to build a bond with her. Socially Imperfect...but still worth it. Renegade is a happy dog, who loves life, loves to play with other dogs, and deserves to live. She's a perfect example of why we do what we do. Just because she's not a 'normal' dog doesn't mean she doesn't deserve to live. Check out this video of her playing: https://www.facebook.com/AutumnAcres/posts/3285192524848339 Renegade doesn't have a sponsor. Want to help provide toys, treats, and routine medical care for her? Become her sponsor! $50 a month is all we need to help provide for her. At Autumn Acres Animal Rescue we believe each individual animal matters. We take in special cases some of which will stay with us as a sanctuary dog.If the animal is listed as a Socially Imperfect Dog this means they have special needs and special requirements for potential adopters.If the animal is listed as a Socially Imperfect RESIDENT this animal is NOT available for adoption and is one of our sanctuary residents. We list them on our sites because they still matter and they still need donations to help with their long term care.Check out our website for more information: http://www.autumnacres.org",

WE are a high intake No Kill Shelter ran by a staff of 4 and do not always have time to answer every question asked by so many. If you are a good fit for the animal you are interested in -we will call to speak with you, If we feel you are not a good fit , we will contact you about other pets that may be a good fit for your home. Many people are losing the opportunity to adopt the animal they want because they fail to put in an application and the pet was adopted before we could answer your email. .If you have applied for an animal in our facility and have not received a response within 7 days, PLEASE call or contact us again. Though we do our best in trying to answer all emails in a timely manner, sometimes things get away from us, get lost or misplaced.

            "description": "Meet Abby\nAge: 2 years\n\nWelcome Abby!  Abby was trapped by a local rescue and transferred to SPR due to our dedication to rehoming Belgian  Malinois dogs.  Abby did well in her foster home. Abby is very shy, but will warm up to you and other dogs when you take things slowly with her. We are still getting to know her, but she seeks attention and wants to be loved.  With all that, she is still a Malinois, so we always recommend having experience with the breed and a plan for mental and physical stimulation.  She will not be a good dog to have in an apartment or a condo.  She is not a dog for protection work either.  We are looking for an experienced handler willing to take it slow and let her learn to trust and thrive in a loving stimulating environment.  \n\n\n*****Belgian Malinois Adoption requirements*****\n\nThe dog you have selected is a Belgian Malinois.  This is a breed that has very specific needs for an adoptive home.  Because of their need for a high level of exercise, both mentally and physically and their need for ongoing training, only applicants with demonstrated owner/handler experience with this breed will be considered.  The vast majority of them are not best suited as family pets, but in homes with experienced handlers knowledgeable of their needs and breed characteristics.  We will not place in homes with small children or small dogs/cats.  \n\nIf you can give Abby  an indoor forever home, please fill out our online application on our website at http://www.savingpawsrescueaz.com/adoption-form/  \n\n We will only schedule meet and greets with an approved application. We are an all-volunteer organziation.  It may take a couple of days to process an application and complete reference checks.\n\nThank you for your interest in saving a life!",

            "description": "\tMIMI is a 7 yr old Shar Pei who came to us after her owner died. She was found in the house by a concerned person who went looking for her owner. Her owner had passed away and Mimi had been in a crate for approximately three days. She is understandably missing her person. It seems like it was just the two of them. Mimi is slow to warm up to new people but when she does, she is a complete love and even a playful little clown! Mimi prefers her home where she is the only pet so she can soak up all the love! She loves to go on walks and we are working on her leash skills. Mimi would also love a large fenced yard to explore. She lived in the city and probably didn\u2019t get too much time to sniff about and smell the roses. Mimi is housebroken and crate trained. We are looking for an adult only home thats not too far away so that we can do several extended meet and greets. Shar-Pei experience is a plus or experience with a similar type of dog. Shar-Peis are known for their skin problems and Mimi\u2018s seems to be at bay currently. Fleas and bad nutrition probably contributed to her hind end hair loss. She has since been treated for fleas, finished a round of antibiotics and is on fish oil for skin support. Mimi has been vaccinated, is presumed to have been spayed and will have a more thorough work up as soon as the vets open up from Covid and we are able to go in with her. Please fill out an application at www.companimals.org if you are the family she is looking for! Adoption $250",

Armani was purchased as a puppy by a young kid and later dumped on the grandmother who was never able to socialize him. At the age of 7, he was returned to the breeder who feared him, kept him in an outdoor kennel and threw his food over the fence to feed him. Armani spent a year in these conditions while a kind hearted woman slowly got to know him through the fence. Slowly they formed a bond and she was allowed into his heart and eventually into his kennel. We eventually had a spot open up and were able to welcome him into our kennel which at least has heat and AC and backs up to a park so we could work on his socialization and leash manners. With his Arnold Schwarzenegger stature, blind eye (from an injury as a puppy) and general aloofness, Armani can be an imposing figure but if you are allowed into his circle of trust he is the proverbial gentle giant and takes treats oh so softly! Armani prefers to be the only pet in the household as he was never properly socialized with other animals. Armani is available for adoption to that special person who is close enough to have several meet and greets and has had experience with a similar type of dog. Armani is neutered, up to date on vaccines and on heartworm/flea/tick prevention. Apply at www.companimals.org or if you prefer to love Armani from afar, donations for his care can be made through the PayPal link on our website.",

He can be shy at first and takes a few minutes to warm up to new people. Zaiden is playful and goofy with his people.\n\nZaiden is not cat safe but gets along well with most dogs. He is a highly velcro dog, preferring to go wherever you go. He crates well and is fine being left alone while his people are away but will want to follow them around when they are home. Zaiden is crate trained and is progressing with his house training. He is a medium energy dog but still loves to play fetch and chase toys in the yard. Zaiden does ok on leash but he does get nervous in new places at times.\n\nZaiden was found on a tether in his yard when his humans moved away. He seems to have been an outdoor dog in his previous life. Zaiden has taken some time on his house training skills. He has a high prey drive and should not be around small animals. Zaiden prefers to be fed in his own space, because he was an outdoor dog without reliable food and water he gets worried about other dogs taking these things away from him. Overall Zaiden is a sweet dog looking for a home that can help him continue to grow as a loved pet.\n\nZaiden is fostered in Wichita, KS\n\nApplications for adoption can be submitted at www.ns4ar.org",

He weighs around 55 pounds and has a full tail! Mr. Willie loves to curl up with his person. He is very goofy and sweet natured.\n\nMr. Willie has not been introduced to cats yet. He gets along with dogs of similar size but is uncomfortable with smaller dogs. Mr. Willie is very Velcro and likes to be with you. He is crate and house trained. Mr. Willie would prefer a home without children. \n\nMr. Willie tries to play with toys but he doesn't seem to understand how. He walks well on leash but does prefer to be touching you. Mr. Willie likes to place chase with his foster human and they have their own unique way to play games together. \n\nMr. Willie is vision impaired and hearing impaired. He does appear to have a little of both but it is limited. This doesn't stop Mr. Willie from being a loving boy with his human and a playful pup with other dogs in his foster home, even if he sometimes play bows in the wrong direction. A fence is required to adopt Mr. Willie.\n\nMr. Willie is fostered in Wichita, KS.\n\nTo apply to adopt visit www.ns4ar.org",

I won\u2019t go into the details you\u2019re probably familiar with them by now.\n \nMy foster momma tells me she can see my sweet soul through my eyes. Sometimes I catch her just looking right into them smiling and looking...they tell a story for sure. They are the kindest eyes you\u2019ll ever see. I'm very gentle and sweet but I\u2019m also very timid and shy. It took me some time to like the other dogs here at my foster home. They got dogs of all sizes, just like at my old place. At first I barked at them and stayed to myself but now they are my friends!\n \nDid you notice my unique ears?! I love getting ear rubs A LOT! I will thank you with the sweetest licks. I\u2019m looking for a home with daily ears rubs. I need someone patient and kind, who will give me lots of space to warm up to you. I\u2019ll let you know I\u2019m happy by wagging my tail but that will have to be enough at least for a little while. I\u2019d like someone who\u2019s home most of the time. I don\u2019t like it when my humans are gone. When I see they are back I whine and bark to let them know I\u2019m happy to see them but no touchy please. I don\u2019t want you to think you can\u2019t rub my belly and give TLC just sometimes I say no by getting up and finding another place to lay. Please don\u2019t be offended.\n \nLoud noises can scare me so smaller children might not be for me. I enjoy treats, toys and playing with my doggie friends. I also love just lounging on the couch. I\u2019m completely potty trained and sleep through the night. I like my own bed but I do like to sleep in the same room with my peoples. If you want to be my peoples please apply for me today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your interest in one of our furry kids! Adopting from Releash Atlanta means you will adopt a dog that has been fully vaccinated, spayed/neutered and microchipped! Our adoption fee is $350\n\n**We only adopt to families in/around Atlanta, Ga (about a 1-2 hour perimeter)**\n\nWe do not monitor our Petfinder email address so if you are interested in any of our dogs, please visit releashatlanta.com to either view more of their profile or to apply! If you have questions, please email adopt@releashatlanta.com \n\nTake a moment and like our Facebook Page for updates on our dogs and the first look at dogs coming into the program! www.facebook.com/releashatlanta\n\nThank you!!",

            "description": "Emma turned one year old on June 6, 2020.  She cannot get enough of being with her people!  We are told she is crate trained.  She did previously live with other dogs, however, she started to demand that she be the only one to get attention from her human mom by being aggressive with the other two dogs.  She has been around children and did well - exuberant children she does shy away from.\n\nEmma knows her basic commands.  She is HIGH energy and needs to burn it off daily.  She also needs help in knowing that jumping up on people is not allowable.  We are looking for an active, strong leader, loving, experienced dog owner who can help round her out - she really does want to please.  I do believe she could live with other dogs with the right training and the right adopter.  Draining her energy daily is key.  She is just a lover!\n\nEmma is negative for heart worm, tick borne illnesses and parasites.  She is also microchipped.  She weighs 50 pounds and is approximately 18-20 inches tall at the shoulder.",

My foster mom thinks I\u2019m the sweetest, gentlest girl ever! I like playing with others dogs a lot but humans are a different story. I haven\u2019t had a great life so far...living outside, scrapping for food, no humans to love me or pet me. But Releash Atlanta saved me from that.\n \nMy foster home is a whole new experience for me. I have regular yummy meals but I\u2019m so timid I need my own space when I eat. I\u2019m working on leash walking but it\u2019s not my favorite so I\u2019ll need a fenced yard. I would love a playmate or two...or three...haha. I\u2019m housetrained based on routine.\n \nIf you\u2019re looking for a cute little companion to add to your family, apply for me today!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your interest in one of our furry kids! Adopting from Releash Atlanta means you will adopt a dog that has been fully vaccinated, spayed/neutered and microchipped! Our adoption fee is $350.\n\nWe do not monitor our Petfinder email address so if you are interested in any of our dogs, please visit releashatlanta.com to either view more of their profile or to apply! If you have questions, please email adopt@releashatlanta.com \n\nTake a moment and like our Facebook Page for updates on our dogs and the first look at dogs coming into the program! www.facebook.com/releashatlanta\n\nThank you!!",

She is very shy dog with people considering she came from an abusive home. She has skin issues due to the neglect that medicated shampoo has helped a lot and her skin and coat are much better. With her age and size, she does have arthritis and is on glucosamine chondroitin. If you are a patient and caring person, and will let Star relax and get used to you in her own time (maybe a week maybe a month or longer), you will find you have a spectacular dog. Star just needs to know she is safe and loved. Star and Abbie came to Lizzy\u2019s together. They told us they would prefer to be placed together, but is not necessary. If you are interested in two dogs, these two would be a perfect pair to have.",

            "description": "Ameila came to us as a stray very thin and covered in fleas and ticks. She rather looks like a Shepherd/Hound type mix but has the drive and 'mouthiness' of a Heeler so perhaps all three, or who knows. She is about one-year old, not a big girl at only about 30 lbs. She is ACTIVE though - loves to run and run and run some more. She loves toys. Big NO to cats. Good with dogs, because she is a bit Heeler type 'nippy' lets say only older children please.\nThe first step to do an adoption is to do our Adoption Application here: https://www.elmorehumane.org/adoption-application-online-form2.html\nADOPTION FEES Dogs & Puppies.....$100.00. This Adoption fee includes: mandatory spay/neuter which will be done before you can take your dog or puppy home with you; basic canine immunizations (DHPP-CPV & Bordatella Intranasal); de-wormings; one-year rabies vaccination if old enough; heartworm test if over five months old; microchip from 24-Pet Watch; certificate for free health examination at your participating veterinarian; and a goodie bag chocked full of information, toys, and more.\nYes, there are sometimes exceptions to our normal fee for older dogs or special cases or adoptions of two dogs together. Some of our pets have also been lovingly sponsored by caring people and we will let the approved adopter know about that at the point of adoption. Visit our Website at: http://www.elmorehumane.org The staff would also like to remind you that for faster response to inquiries about adoptable animals to have the animals ID#, name & description.This way your questions will be answered in a timely manner.\nYou can also expedite the adoption process by filling our Adoption Application which you can find at: http://www.elmorehumane.org/HSEC_FORMS/AdoptionApplication.pdf and sending to us either by scanning and emailing to hselco@bellsouth.net or faxing to 334-567-8774.\nAll pet adoption websites & our shelter management software require that we choose a primary and/or secondary breed for our dogs. While our staff is quite breed knowledgeable, in many cases we are truly making our best guesses as to their breed(s) based on many factors but cannot promise that what we have said is accurate. So taking into account your own parameters for things such as size, coat care, activity level, etc please come and get to know our dog(s) as individuals to see if their personalities and yours are a forever match.\nThank you!

            "description": "Meet Hazel! She came as a stray in Haines City with Adele + 9 puppies. We were told Hazel was the dad, got her in cage and then realized she was a female but no way she was getting left behind! She's a senior pittie mix, about 55 pounds and 10 years old. In boarding she was sad and down. Just a few days in a foster home and she is playing with the other senior dog and so happy!! She wants a forever home with someone to give her all the love she missed in her life so far with a comfy couch and a yard to sunbathe and play in. She is a bit hard of hearing as an old gal so no kids to be safe. When you stop petting her, she will lift a paw trying to beg for more! She is so sweet and cute and we love this girl! She is house trained and loves belly rubs and a good bone to chew on!\n\nTo meet Hazel please fill out an application on www.maxxandme.org. She will be spayed, up to date on vaccines, and microchipped. Her adoption donation is only $125!\n\nMaxx & Me is an all volunteer, all foster home rescue and do not have a shelter. Please allow at least 48 hours for applications to be processed (missing information may slow the process, so please take your time and be thoughtful in your answers). All dogs posted are available (so no need to ask). We place dogs based on best home for each dog and not order of applications received. Email us at maxxandmerescue@gmail.com for updates and questions. Thank you for choosing rescue.",

He's in treatment now and should be just fine once he completes treatment. Red is friendly and affectionate. He loves other dogs and is a good play partner (though he will herd them from time to time). He is very smart and willing to learn. We have house trained him (though a new home will require supervision) and taught him to stay in a crate when we're not home. He is still very puppy and needs a bit of supervision (he loves our shoes at the moment...working on it! lol). Red is going to be an amazing buddy for some lucky human. Is he your new best friend?\n\nAdoptions should be within driving distance of Tulsa, OK. Red must stay in the area until at least 8/14 to complete his heartworm treatment. \n\nInterested?

            "description": "Everest is a very lucky boy. He came to our attention when a family member was sick and tired over the abuse and neglect this poor sweet loving boy was forced to endure thru his life. Her uncle was in jail AGAIN. Everest has spent much of his life chained in a filthy dirty backyard. He was underweight, flea and tick infested, huge sores on his ears from fly strikes and was dragged out on a choke chain to hand him over. No regard whatsoever that this was a breathing, sensitive loving being. Everest has flourished in his fosters home. He is very smart and extremely grateful. He is around 4 years old. He is a great running partner, loves to play! \nAll dogs in our program are current on all their shots and micro chipped.  Also included is one FREE group session with our amazing trainer to his Street Obedience Class is included and not to be missed.We do not place dogs on a first come first serve basis, but rather to the home best suited for them. An adoption fee, application, and contract are required. All our dogs can be met with an approved application.  We do not place dogs on a first come first serve basis, but rather to the home best suited for them. Thank you for looking at a rescue dog for your next family member!

We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our pets based on personality, not breed label.\n\nHi, I am getting worn out.  I have been on  a Shelter situation for over 3 years, the place is nice, I have an inside outside large place but, all I want for Christmas is to have a home to call my own\n\n.Georgina, is an energetic, curious, happy 6-year old spayed Staffordshire Terrier Mix female dog. At 65 pounds, Georgina is one big love bug. She's easygoing, loves her people, and is looking for someone who will spend some time with her. Georgina was born in 2014, she is house trained and microchipped; she knows her basic commands, sit, stay, down. Georgina is single and loving it, meaning that she would do best as the only dog in the home, she can be unpredictable with other dogs, she will walk quietly by any dog while on leash but she needs to be the only dog in a home, and she cannot live with cats. Georgy isn't too high energy, but she is strong, so she'll need someone who can physically handle a big, affectionate dog.  This sweetheart has been waiting a long time for her forever home, so don't wait, inquire today!\n\n\nGeorgina is up to date on all her vaccinations, she is heartworm negative and in excellent health. If you like to foster or adopt Georgina, call or text Kelly at 817-296-1427 or Miguel at 817-798-8416. \n",

B-MO loves to do adventures, laugh, is a goofball, and overall a fun character. We named this precious pooch B-MO in his honor. He is a very affectionate dog who loves chew toys and is a goofball who will make you laugh. We would love to introduce him to you and any fur-babies you already have.

Needless to say she isn't very confident.  She spent some time in a home but managed to bust thru a screen the first time and the second time she panicked while on lead and got away.  Charlotte definitely knows how to take care of herself!  She survived in the woods for weeks until she was trapped.  So you can bet this girl - especially - will not be going to just any home.  Ideally you will be familiar with fearful dogs.  No ifs, ands, or buts.  If you know you can provide a safe home for Charlotte, please go to our website \"odas.org\" and fill out a preliminary under the Adopt column.  We will then schedule an appointment for her to meet you.",

Dogs in the ORANGE category are commonly timid and will need some confidence building at first. Once dogs in the ORANGE category are comfortable, they will most likely be energetic and needing similar guidance to dogs that are in the YELLOW category. Dogs in the ORANGE category sometimes benefit from another confident canine in the home.\n\nDogs are assigned to color categories using any previous owner notes, general handling, as well as staff and volunteer observations. As we continue to get to know the dogs and gather further insights into their personalities, colors may be adjusted accordingly.\n\nDove is sponsored by Elf, Rowry and their family.\n\nRancho Coastal Humane Society remains temporarily closed to the general public, but we have companion animals in our care that are ready for adoption BY APPOINTMENT ONLY, and our staff is ready to make that happen!  Please visit our website for updates and more information.  Thank you for your interest.\n\nAdoption Hours: Wednesday\u2013Monday; 11 AM to 4:30 PM  (Closed Tuesdays)\n\nAddress: 389 Requeza Street, Encinitas, CA 92024\n\n",

            "description": "Our handsome young boy, Dodger, is taking applications for his furever home! Dodger was an outside dog who transitioned to inside life when he was surrendered to rescue last summer. He is a neutered, purebred Great Pyrenees who still has some rough edges. Like most Pyrs, he is a loving dog who wants to be with his people. He will sit and stay with you wherever you are and can be quite the goof ball, making you laugh if he invites you to join his special game of fetch. Dodger is okay with cats and other dogs and could benefit from a female companion. He tends to get a little rough when he wants to play with humans, mouthing and jumping. He also has some trauma triggers that need to be understood by his owners who must be willing to work with him. Dodger is okay with new humans once proper introductions have been made. He is a dog for an experienced dog owner who is willing to work with him and our behaviorist. We are limiting his adoption area to Ohio/Pennsylvania so his progress can be monitored as needed. We have no doubt that with a little time and love, this big boy will mature into the most pyrfect companion for some lucky adopter!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nView full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed. \n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

A kind neighbor has worked with the owners to help the dogs into better situations. Sonny was extremely scared when he came to us. He would cower from us and have accidents, but over the span of a few weeks, he began to trust us and has really come out of his shell. He now loves his human friends, has learned to walk on a leash, and learned sit. We are seeking a home without children for Sonny. He enjoys being around other dogs, but prefers certain personality types over others due to his past. We are seeking a home with no other dogs, although you can meet up with some friends and their dogs if you'd like. Sonny is currently living with a volunteer foster family.

            "description": "Poor Dennis! My heart goes out to this guy. He lived in the country with a single woman and her 6 kids.  He loved those kids! Very friendly and happy with them.  Mom and kids moved and just left Dennis there!  He is heartbroken and has not left the porch waiting for them to return.\nA kind neighbor has been taking him some food/water. \n\nWe took him in yesterday, he\u2019s a big boy!! Seems to be a mix of Lab/Great Dane around 1-2 years old. Very scared about all the changes, never touched pavement, rode in a car, had a leash on, air conditioning etc. Look how sad this baby is!\n\nWe will have Dennis vetted, and then hopefully he can go into a new loving home! He would adore kids.... \nWell we now call him Dennis the Menace, as we can\u2019t catch him to get him neutered yet!  He\u2019s loving his new life here, has filled out, very healthy and happy and has lots of doggy friends! His day is coming tho!\n\n\n\nAdoption fee includes spaying/neutering, shots, micro-chip and heartworm testing.\nPlease contact Dinesha  at 972-896-6313 or email at adbadoptions@yahoo.com.  To see dogs please download an application from our website, www.adifferentbreed.org and email to foster parents address above. We will arrange a meet and greet. Dogs that have been housebroken may need a refresher course or just learn your new routine.  Maybe they used a doggie door or rang a bell to go out.  Please have patience and give them some time!",

He needs some consistency and confidence building.\n\nHe goes out in the yard at the shelter with other dogs and all previous homes have stated he\u2019s great with other dogs. Rio can be a nervous dog and he needs people to move slowly with him. He would do best with an adopter who understand this and doesn\u2019t have young kids.\n\nHe also house trained and knows a few cool tricks! He was very sweet to our dogs and my 10 year old nephew loved him! He\u2019s a little shy at first but opens up very quickly!\n\nRio is currently in a foster home and available for adoption. Adoptions must be done in person.\n\nFort Worth, TX\n",

We think a more rural area without a lot of other dogs around would be ideal. When he is comfortable with you, he can be very sweet and even lies on his back for belly rubs.  Jackson has a medium energy level and comes out of the kennel ready for any adventure \u2013 near or far. He is in training on leash as he can pull and is strong. If he suspects a potentially challenging attitude in other dogs, he can growl and react. He does ok with supervision around calmer more easygoing dogs who know to give him space. If you are an experienced leader, this warrior prince is your boy.\n\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website! So, check in and log on often! \n\nWestside thanks you for looking at our amazing dogs and for choosing to save an animal's life through rescue. \n\nDon't forget to visit your local animal shelter...the source of many of our dogs.\n \n\nwww.sheprescue.org\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/WGSRescue\n\n",

He is a calmer boy in our kennel setting, he settles in nicely on walks, and he walks well with other dogs and does not pull on leash. Bravo\u2019s presence of mind requires a calm and confident owner; and the rewards will be infinite, as he will respect and treasure your bond - he can be very loving with his people. In playgroups, he enjoys meeting other calm canine friends, surveying the atmosphere, and returning to greet people. The kennel staff remark how he always has a smile on his face. He even knows his basic commands, and he is housebroken and crate trained. He would really enjoy a task or a goal. He wants to show you he can accomplish anything with the right structure. Although he generally does okay around dogs, he does not appreciate certain males, and needs a cat free home. Bravo is looking for his better half, one who will form a partnership based on honor, structure, and admiration. Can we all give him a \u201cbravo!!\u201d\n\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website!

Special training needs right now to help him along with confidence. \nHe is around 10 months old and boy can he play and play like all Labradors like to do. He goes out with a variety of dogs, but mostly Bubblegum who he loves to play with all day.\nHe has shown some fear with some new folks when he meets them. We believe something happened to him during quarantine, from a man, that who was not nice to him. He is perfect when we introduce him to people, very loving with people and with our crew.\nWe advise an experienced handler that can help him continue to navigate the world with knowledgeable and positive guidance.\nWould be great  with knowledgeable handler and should have another dog to play and learn positive behavior with and he will be ready for his new loving life.\nRemember young Labradors ARE ACTIVE and need training and lots of activities. He needs a play friend for sure and classes.\nWe think he was locked down some where odd during the corona lockdown, because he was rather confused when he came in. Not normal puppy behavior. He looked a bit dazed.  \nHE IS WITH SENIOR LABRADOR MIX ASHLEY  IN THE PORTRAIT PIC and JUMPING OVER BUBBLEGUM in the other picture to show his active, agile, puppy behavior.\nup to date on shots, micro chipped, neutered\nPLEASE LET US KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR OLLIE TO HAVE A GREAT LIFE IN YOUR EMAIL with your application.\nPlease FILL OUT AN APPLICATION our website www.LindaBlairWorldheart.org and see many of our adoptable dogs.\nDOGS ARE LOCATED IN ACTON,CA and by appointment only.\nFollow us on Facebook/Linda Blair Worldheart Foundation\nTwitter and Instagram@LindaBlairWF\nYour donations help us save CA pets lives",

Upon intake he weighs just over 50 pounds. Due to his ACL surgeries on both knees, 50 pounds is a good ideal weight for him in order to put less pressure on those knees.\nDOB 8-1-2018...All pets have lifetime sanctuary at Haven of the Ozarks. If they cannot remain with their adopter, they must be returned to the Haven.\n\nAdoption fees are as follows: \nPuppies under the age of 6 months - $125\nDogs weighing 30 pounds and less - $125 \nDogs ages 6 months to 5 yrs old - $90\nDogs over the age of 5 yrs old - $75.\nCats under the age of 6 months old - $75\nCats over the age of 6 months old - $65",

            "description": "Rocky Balboa\nMale\nAge: 3 Years old\nWeight: 54 lbs\nBreed: Boxer/Terrier mix\n\nHi there! My name is Rocky Balboa! I am a boxer, after all! Im a hunk of energy who LOVES to play ball; in fact, it is the only toy I care for and will play fetch every day! Im even learning how to play volleyball! I can run super fast and will always return the ball for more tosses! My foster parents are teaching me to drop, back (as in step back,) and easy so I dont get too excited and try to take the ball away too fast. Im getting pretty darn good at it too! A couple of good throws and I will be ready for a good nap! I do well with other dogs provided slow introductions are conducted and will require a period where I can get acclimated to them. When Im not wanting to play, Im always wanting to cuddle and sit on peoples laps. I will certainly let you know when I want to snuggle! I hope that is okay, I just love people so much! Sometimes my foster family cannot cuddle with me and ask for me to go lay down and I will head over to my own bed and take a nap. I also have learned to wait until I receive the command from my foster family for meal time and have shown to be very gentle when I receive treats!\nSince I do not personally enjoy being home alone, my foster family has figured out if I get a good walk in or have a good play session prior to them leaving, those activities will help keep me napping for a few hours allowing me to have plenty of doggy dreams until they return. Also, I just love people and people seem to like me too! I always get compliments during my walks and how handsome I am! I have gotten better walking on a leash, but truly prefer having the capacity to run around freely! I also love car rides! I am always down for a good adventure! \nA fenced in yard would be even more awesome because then I can show you how fast I am and how I am basically a professional volleyball player! I would love extra space to run around while also exploring freely! I am also house trained and crate trained! I cant wait until I find my forever home so I can dazzle them with my personality and cuddles!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting the handsome Rocky Balboa, apply to adopt at www.causeforcanines.org Adoption fee is $250\nChildren must be 13 years old or older.\nMust be 25 years old and an Ohio resident.\nUnfortunately, no cats.",

Monty likes to go for walks and generally be where ever the people are. He loves kids and he is good with most other dogs but he has never been around cats. Monty is up to date with shots, neutered, negative for heartworms/on prevention and crate trained. To make Monty your forever dog, please submit an adoption application at www.myhstc.org\n\nAdoption fee is $85 which includes veterinary care\n\nwe prescreen all applicants prior to a meeting.

EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY:  Meetings at our Adoption Center are by appointment only (no walk-ins).  An online adoption application is required and must be approved prior to meeting any animals.  Adoption appointments are set up by email by our Adoption Coordinator (no phone calls, please).  This process ensures our dedicated time to the animals in our care, as well as full attention to adopters at scheduled times.  \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

Precious was saved by a good samaritan who rescued her from a backyard breeder where she was overbred for years & severely neglected.  This poor girl was forced to live outside where she was repeatedly attacked & injured by other dogs. She is an incredibly sweet girl who loves people, and even does well with other low key dogs in spite of her difficult past.  She is looking for a foster home where she can rest and recover with a person/family who will keep her safe and manage very slow introductions if there are other dogs in the home.\n\nFor more information about Precious, please email us at info@barkvilledogrescue.org.

            "description": "Hey everyone I'm Lou, better known as BIG LOU! I'm a 9 year old Chihuahua that likes to be where the actions at. I'm a Chihuahua so you all know what that means. I'm not good with kids so please don't ask, I'm more like a piece of furniture with attitude. I would like to be in a home to live out my golden years. I'm 9 so I don't like surprises and you need to speak up a bit so I can hear you. Once I trust you, I like to be picked up and taken outside so I can wander around the yard. I will do my business on a potty pad so a fenced yard isn't necessary but I do like the fresh air. I have a neurological problem that took my gitty up away but I'm hobbling just fine, just need some helpful attention sometimes. Once I trust you, please pick me up and let me sit with you or even better yet, let me in bed with you. I can be very vocal when I want attention so any type of apartment life won't be for me. If you feel like you are dog savvy enough to help me through my Golden years, please speak up so I can hear you. I'll be waiting right here for you. Lou is neutered, up to date on all vaccines, had a heart worm test, on heartworm preventative, had a fecal, had a full blood panel, had a dental, and microchipped. Lou\u2019s adoption fee is $250.00. Out of state adopters are responsible for arranging transport, WE DO NOT SHIP DOGS. For events calendar and adoption application please go to our website at aaprescue.org.",

The perfect home would be one that provides structure, routine, calm activity inside and where someone\u2019s home most of the day to keep her company.\n\nDon\u2019t get us wrong, she still has plenty of energy to go on long walks, play with her squeaky toys, splash around in her pool and engage in a robust game of tug-of-war with you, but  she gets anxious around noise and chaos. Especially the commotion produced by young children, so if there are children in the home, she prefers them to be older. \n\nSassy enjoys the companionship of large, calm dogs, but no small dogs or cats please! Too tempting to chase.\n\nThis affectionate girl is friendly meeting new people, has good house manners and loves to snuggle with her people at the end of the day. Sassy\u2019s foster mom is working on loose-leash walking and helping her to be more comfortable in a crate. She has a way of staring at her people and following them around to signal that it\u2019s time for a potty break. So smart! And speaking of smart \u2013 she knows most of the basic obedience commands. Sassy needs an\nexperienced owner committed to continuing with her training on a regular basis. Could that exceptional person be you?\n\nSassy is 11-years-young and weighs approximately 60 pounds.\n\n\n",

She is looking for her one true love, and needs that special person to keep her loved and held for the rest of her life. \n\nChicka has some minor special issues that the one true love will be happy to accommodate \u2013 1) she has no teeth left so she\u2019ll need a special high-quality soft food and 2) she has dry eyes so she will need drops every day.  Such minor things when you look at that adorable face!\n\nOur kissy, lovey, give-me-belly-rubs, Chicka is a bit nervous around other dogs, so she will need to be the centre of attention of only one person.  She will bark and become anxious when crossing paths with other dogs, but will move on with some reassurance and redirection.  She doesn\u2019t mind a quick drive in the car now and then, but does prefer to walk, as it can sometimes give her anxiety.  She is also not a fan of grooming, so a professional will need to be on call.  This can change with patience and repetition.  She will also need to be with a semi-retired or retired family/person as she will bark when left alone.  \n\nWalks are a happy thing for this doll \u2013 she is good on her harness and will get excited when squirrels or bunnies cross her path.  Redirection away from other dogs is necessary, but doesn\u2019t detract from the fun of the rest of the adventure.  \n\nMore than anything, Chicka just wants to find her one true love, her forever person.  She wants all the hugs, attention, and loving she can get.  \n\nIf you are the match for this gorgeous, loving companion, please submit the adoption application at www.ckanimalrescue.com\n\nChicka is up to date with vaccinations, and is spayed.\n\nAdoption fee: $375\n",

He loves attention, he loves other dogs, and he loves his people.  He is very vocal and will let you know when someone is coming or going, but is easily corrected if he doesn\u2019t quiet down.  He also loves to be on his walks.  He will pull on the harness from time to time, but again, is super good with being corrected, and a treat makes him super happy to comply.  \n\nPom Pom needs a playmate, but we have not experienced how he is with cats.  He loves a car ride, he\u2019ll just lay there and be content to travel.  Take him to Timmies for a Tim Bit and he\u2019ll be your BFF forever.   \n\nThis fun fella has had quite a few teeth extracted, so he only has a few remaining.  He will require small bits of small food mixed in with canned/wet food.  But it definitely doesn\u2019t stop him from enjoying a good bite to eat!  (He will require soft treats as well.)\n\nPom Pom needs someone who is willing to work with him and be patient with his barking.  He is just excitable, and has to let you know what\u2019s happening.  Bites of cheese or soft treats work wonders to make him listen.  He will even shake a paw and lay down to have that reward.\n\nIf you and your dog are looking for a friendly, lovable and playful companion, please submit the adoption application at www.ckanimalrescue.com\n\nPom Pom is up to date with vaccinations, and is neutered.\n\nAdoption fee: $300\n",

He loves to play fetch with squeaky toys and will take every opportunity to do so! Oscar does well in the home with other dogs, but he's not a fan of cats. Oscar did not get the best report card from his previous home or the shelter, and because of that, we ask for an adult only home. Oscar is not house-trained and will require a little bit of work but when he's inside, he doesn't mind wearing his belly bands (doggy diapers). He also loves to go for long walks and is always up for an adventure exploring the city. If Oscar isn\u2019t bringing you his toy to play with him, he\u2019s pushing your hand up demanding you give him pets and belly rubs! A little training and a lot of love will make all the difference for Oscar and he's worth it! He is so smart and also food motivated. Apply today to make him a permanent member of your family!\n\nThis animal's adoption fee is $200 \n\n\n\n",

She will just melt your heart. This mid-sized dog is 9-years-old.\n\nWhen she arrived at Mostly Muttz Rescue's southern shelter partner, one of her legs was broken in several places. It was very painful for her, and the leg could not be saved. The sweet princess is still learning life on three legs. She is shy when first meeting people, but once you gain her trust she will provide oodles of love wanting nothing more than to be in your lap!\n\nGIGI does fine with other dogs if they are calm. She is totally happy just curling up on your lap and loving you. Will you be the lucky home who chooses GIGI?

Aliyah is good tempered and people friendly. Aliyah is dominant towards other dogs but is not aggressive. She does not bite them. She will growl and rush them to warn them away from her food bowl or her toys. Aliyah is NOT good with cats and will chase them. Aliyah would be happy being the only dog. Aliyah's focus is to please her person. Aliyah comes when she is called. She knows how to \"sit\". Aliyah loves to retrieve objects and play tug of war. She especially loves to find and chew soda bottles. Aliyah is very skilled at communicating her needs. If she wants attention or food she will bark until her owner listens. Aliyah is a joyful dog with a great smile.",

            "description": "This dog is being fostered in Dallas TX and must be adopted within the Dallas, North Central Texas or the southern Oklahoma area.\n\nNAME:             Daisy\nGENDER:        Female (Spayed)\nAGE:                 10 years old\nWEIGHT:         About 7 pounds\nDOGS:               Tolerates other small dogs (would be best as an only dog)\nCATS:                Unknown with cats\nCHILDREN:     All adult home, experienced adopters recommended\n\nMeet Daisy.  This girl has blossomed like a flower with CRT and is now ready to begin her search for a forever home.\n\nDaisy currently holds the distinction of the longest tenured foster in our CRT program.  She has been with CRT since May of 2019.  You heard that right \u2013 over a year in our foster program.  Daisy was found as a stray by Burleson Animal Services. She was shy and frightened, and BAS knew her best chance would be with a rescue where she could feel safe, begin to gain confidence, and grow.  So BAS reached out to CRT and asked us to bring this girl into our program.  We were happy to do so, and have been amazed at this girl\u2019s progress.  She is now ready for the next phase of her life \u2013 a life filled with love and happiness.\n\nDaisy tolerates the other small dogs in her foster home.  She is MUCH more interested in her people!  This girl loves to go outside and explore the yard.  She enjoys being outside when you have your morning coffee.  Daisy will also lay and sun herself.  There are no cats in her foster home, so we do not know how she would do with cats.  She also does not show interest in playing with toys.\n\nDaisy adores her family.  Daisy is a bit shy when she first meets someone.  We believe this is because of her early years.  She may have been abused, at least verbally, as she is uncomfortable when people tower above her and reach down for her.  The fastest way to get to know her is to sit down and let her come up to you!  She will take some extra patience while she works up the courage to let you pet her. Once she gets comfortable with you, Daisy is a big snuggler.  We are looking for an experienced family who will be patient as she adjusts and gets comfortable in her new home.\n\nDaisy would like to be the only dog whose family cuddles with her day a lot.  She is somewhat of a diva because she loves everything that is soft and luxurious.  She loves soft blankets, a favorite chair, the couch and your bed.  One of her favorite places is napping on the pillows on your bed!  She loves to snuggle with you on the couch when you are watching TV at night.  She will roll over for belly rubs \u2013 it is one of her favorite things!  She would love a mellow home where she could be your BFF and snuggle with you daily.\n\nDaisy is about 10 years old.  She weighs 7 pounds, which is a great weight for her.  Daisy needed a dental when we got her.  Because of her neglect in her early years, she lost almost all her teeth during her dental.  She now has one ADORABLE tooth!  She is a great eater though!  She is primarily tan with a white neck and chest.  And her ears are amazing!  Daisy does alert at loud noises, but settles down fairly quickly.\n\nDaisy is housebroken and she knows how to use a doggy door.  Daisy is crate trained and happily goes into her crate at night to sleep.  She is afraid of leashes (probably something in her early life) and therefore we have not taken her for walks.  We are not sure if she will ever learn to like this.  She would not be apartment appropriate for this reason.\n\nDaisy\u2019s ideal home would be a laid back environment where people are home a lot.  She gets joy from just hanging out with her people.  We are recommending an all adult home for her.  We also would like to find an experienced home that will be patient with her as she adjusts, learns that she is safe with you and begins to relax in her new home.  She has SO MUCH love to share.  We have fallen in love with this girl.  We are hoping you will too!\n\nDaisy is being fostered in the DFW (Texas) area. If this sweet girl sounds like the right fit for your home, our CRT adoption form can be found at: http://www.chihuahua-rescue.com/adoption-application/\n\nDaisy is spayed, micro chipped, up-to-date on shots, HW negative. and on heartworm prevention.  She is ready to join a loving family \u2013 could that family be yours?\n\nThis dog is a CRT rescue. Reference checks, adoption contract and $250 adoption fee plus Texas Sales Tax required (note: as of 1-1-20, the Texas State Comptroller office is requiring all rescue groups to collect sales tax on adoptions, even though we are all 501c3. We are all fighting this, but for now, have been told it is non-negotiable).\n\nAs part of our mission to reduce the number of unwanted and sick dogs, we require that all current pets are spayed or neutered, current on vaccinations and taking heart worm prevention. Applications will not be considered if one or more of these requirements are not met.\n\nAfter filling out an adoption application (found at http://www.chihuahua-rescue.com/adoption-application/), please email DFWCoordinator@chihuahua-rescue.com if you are interested in this dog. Please be sure to read about our adoption process and then fill out an adoption application before emailing the contact person.",

Need an officemate for that transition to working at home, Chloe's resume is impeccable. She will happily supervise your work from a comfy bed or chair right next to your desk. Chloe is choosy about her friends both human and canine. She would prefer a quiet house where she can enjoy her besties.\n\nWe think Chloe is approx 5-7 years old. She is spayed, UTD on all vaccinations and has been microchipped. Chloe is in pretty good health but she does have luxating patellas on her back legs which may require surgery. We will be pursing that and will complete any necessary surgeries or procedures prior to final adoption. Her foster reports that she is adjusting well, is sweet as can be, and is mainly potty trained but has the occasional accident. She also says she is getting along with her furry foster brother and sister.\n\nWe will be keeping Chloe in foster until her surgery is complete and she is on her way to being 100%. If you are interested in Chloe please fill out an application and we will contact you once we are ready to begin the meet and greet process.\n\nClick on the link below to fill out our adoption application\n\nAdoption Application",

He is just a country boy looking for a loving family who will help him adapt to city life. He has spent most of his short life on a chain outside but he hasn't let that get him down. He is loving and smart and just needs somebody who is willing to teach him the ropes.\n\nHe is just over a year old (His birthday is 9/15/2019) and he is ready to find his forever home.

I'll bet you thought I was lost. Well I was kind of hiding because I had eye surgery and had to wear a very annoying necklace that covered my face. I just refused to be seen in public like that but I'm great now and ready to Rock & Roll!\n\nSince I was kinda just learning before my surgery I forgot how to play but my FB is trying to remind me and I'm remembering how much fun that was. My FM says she's so proud of me because I remembered it's ok to go out on a leash, ride in the car, and sit or down for treats. I love being smart so FM only has to say \"outside\" once and I go right to the door. I wait patiently for my meals and I go out right after I finish so I don't have any accidents in the house. I also know the word \"out\" means I can't go in the kitchen when FM is cooking or in the toy room when the kiddies are eating. I love kids too. When kids visit my FM I like to stay in the playroom. My favorite thing is lying around with my FB. He lets me steal his bones and his crate too. I love having a sibling. I nap in my own crate during the day and sleep in it at night if FM is too wiggly in the bed. Oh, and I just love when someone says my name. I get so wiggly that my tail goes so fast it almost disappears. I'm still shy but when people don't rush up to me I like to smell their back and then I make friends with them. I even let them pet me and I wag my tail. I'm still afraid of sudden noises but I'm so much better. I know Airplanes, leaves and compressors are not going to harm me. Not so sure about traffic and skateboards. I don't mind the broom or sweeper anymore but I like to go in the crate if that big vacuum comes out. FM still tells me I'm one of the smartest dogs she's ever met. When FM goes out I usually go get one of her shoes and maybe a slipper or two but it's just to keep me company. I don't chew on it. I LOVE chewing on Kongs with canned food or veggies though. I chew and bury, then chew and bury some more. I like burying my favorite things in my crate. I haven't worked on anything new this week because I'm just relaxing after having that awful head gear but I remembered all my manners I learned before my eye surgery. I know you have the perfect place for me. At least 1 FM and 1 sibling. More is fine as FM has lots of visitors but I am most comfortable when it's pretty quiet. I really need a crate for when I need to build courage but other than that I'm pretty easy going. I'm not fussy about food but my tummy needs changes to be slow.\n\nWell, I just wanted you to know I'm all healed up and hope you weren't too worried. The scavenger hunt we went on was so fun and now it's your turn to come find me. Ready, set, go!\n\n5/23/20: I know it's taking a while for you to find me, what with the way everything's upside down now, but I'm taking advantage and practicing to be the best friend I can be for you. In just the last few weeks I've learned how to walk on the leash and the last few days I found out there's some pretty good smells out there too! FM is proud that I walk so nicely on the leash; I don't pull at all unless you count the times I freeze when something scares me. At first it was all real scary but now I'm interested in scouting out some more of those smells, I'm still working on ignoring the noises. I love my FB and we play hard when we first wake up and right before supper. He's teaching me how to squeak toys and we play tug of war. FM says I'm like a cuddly lap dog because when she sits down I want to be right next to her. While I'm waiting for you I'm also practicing manners and FM says I'm a really smart girl. She told me my furever family will be so happy they found me because I'm the best girl, so funny and so smart, yup, that's what she says.\n\n5/9/20: Rosie here, checking in. The last couple weeks have been very exciting for me. FM is so proud of me because I didn't have any accidents in the house. She did tell me it would be nice if I could alert her when I have to go out so she didn't have to open the door to check and I just looked at her and said, \"I am\" you just don't know my language yet! I love playing with my FB, I have a den I can go sleep in where it is safe and cozy. Sometimes I just sleep on my FB's beds during the day but at night when FM says, \"night night time\" I run right in my crate. This week FM said I had a major accomplishment because I walked a little bit in the neighborhood. Truthfully I didn't like it very much but FM says if we keep practicing I will learn to love it just as much as my FB. I also am curious about school time. My FB and his GSD look at FM and position when she says a word. FM says it won't be long before I have to perform too or I won't get free treats because she says I'm so very smart. This week I learned that \"Leave it\" means I have to stop doing what I'm doing. It's hard because those treats FM has on her table look so tempting but I love to see my FM happy and tell me what a good girl I am so I just walk away. She said I am going to be an A+ for someone who wants a comfy pal to cuddle with, silly girl to laugh at and best friend for their other pet. I can't wait to meet you.\n\n4/26/20: Hi all, Rosie here again. I just wanted to let you know how well I'm doing. I love my FB and we play boxing every day, especially when we wake up. FM laughs at us and says we look like kangaroos, I don't know what a kangaroo is but I know I love wrestling with my FB. Well I finally learned that the back door isn't as scary as I first thought and now I even go out the door all by myself when FM says, \"Rosie, outside?\" It's a little scary if the wind blows but my spot outside is nice and small so I feel safe as long as I can see the open door. FM gets so excited when squat and I get extra wet food. I tried fooling her a few times by just sitting down but it didn't work. FM said, \"Rosie you are such a smart girl but no treat for that.\" I get treats for letting FM put a leash on my collar too as long as she takes it right off I don't try to run in my crate when I see it. FM said just keep practicing and it'll be ok just like the back door. My FB had a play date so I met his German Shephard friend when her Mom needed a sitter for an hour. We made friends right away and we played outside on the patio. I even forgot I was afraid when a truck went by. FM said when that Covid-19 goes away all the grandkids will come play with me too. I'm so excited for that. I like to watch some animals on T.V and even on FM's phone. I especially like to watch myself play. When the wind broke the T.V. a man came to the house and I didn't run and hide, I just watched him. A new man had to come the next day so I thought I'd just follow him around and lie by his feet when he was sitting on the floor to make sure he fixed it right this time. FM was so happy for me. She said, \"Rosie, you sure are practicing so well it won't be long before your furever family finds you.\n\n4/13/20: That nasty covid thing interrupted my settling in so I had to go to another foster home with a new FM and a new FB. To tell you the truth the first few days were kinda rough, but I am getting used to the new environment. I'm still resting a lot so I can put on some weight but I heard FM on the phone telling the vet that my stomach issues are resolved. I think that's good because I feel so much better. I'm still shy and not sure it's safe outside my crate but my FB keeps encouraging me to come out and sniff around. I'm beginning to follow him a little more and I wag my tail really hard when FM says good morning. I'm trying hard to learn that the back door is a safe place and I watch my FB run in and out trying to get me to follow him. Maybe tomorrow? FM keeps telling me I'm practicing to go to a forever home. I wag my tail and imagine a home with at least one sibling and even a kid or two, the more the merrier right? Now that my tummy issues are gone and they say I'm fixed up so I won't have puppies I'll just keep practicing until you find me.\n\n2/28/20: Rosie here! I'm still very timid. Foster mom and dad still have to pick me up to take me outside. I lived a really rough life before and I'm still learning to trust. I stay in one room and don't like to come out, but when my foster family comes to me, I get really excited and wiggle my whole body now!!! I am learning to play a bit. My foster fur sister and I have gotten into a couple tiffs over high value items like special toys and chew bones (mom now doesn't let us have those unless the other is not around - insert sad face). She doesn't think it was me causing the problem, my foster fur sister is a bit spoiled and doesn't like to share much.\n\nI need a family who will take time to show me I'm loved. I am not going to immediately be a big cuddle bug, but I think in ",

Our mission: To balance the health, safety, and welfare needs of Boxers in the Carolinas (and parts of Virginia and Georgia) by providing a loving and safe environment for stray, abused, impounded and owner surrendered dogs by placing them in foster homes and ultimately - forever homes.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDog's Name: Charlotte\n\nDog's Approximate Age: 5 years\n\nGender: Female\n\nDog's Size: Pocket Boxer (under 50lbs as adult and healthy weight)\n\nDog's Weight: 45 pounds\n\nGood with small dogs?: No\n\nGood with big dogs?: No\n\nGood with cats?: Don't know yet\n\nGood with kids?: Yes, all ages\n\nAny medical issues?: None\n\nCrate trained?: Working on it\n\nHouse trained?: Yes\n\nHeartworms?: No\n\n12/17/20: Charlotte is a super sweet girl. She loves all people and hasn't meet a stranger yet. Her favorite things are going for walks, car rides and snuggling on the sofa. She is completely house trained and has never had an accident. We are working on her getting used to the crate. She is also working on her leash reactivity towards other dogs while on walks. She is able to be redirected with guidance. She does great in car rides and loves to go to with the family to the beach and trails.\n\nCharlotte would do best to have a 6' privacy fenced yard so she has a safe place to play- she has come a very long way but is still quite reactive on a leash when she sees other dogs. She also has some separation anxiety when left alone, so she would love a forever home where there are people home with her a lot of the time.\n\n9/16/20: Charlotte loves cuddling, riding in the car and walks. She is a sweet girl with lots of love to give, wants to be where the action is. Scared of thunder, be prepared to have her in bed with you when there is a storm brewing.\n\n7/8/20: Loves people, attention and snuggles. We love her already and we have had her only one day- more updates to come\n\n5/30/20: Charlotte is the kindest most loving 5 year old. My kids 7 and 1 and 1/2 yrs old love on her and she just eats it up. She loves to walk great on the leash, and loves human company. She's not great with other dogs yet but manages a few barks and moves on with you. Charlotte is her new name and she's learning it slowly!\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCome visit carolinaboxerrescue.org to learn more about me and see more pictures.

Sorry for the delay, my new foster dad keeps saying the world is a crazy place these days. All I know is life is good as long as I get treats and a peanut butter filled Kong.\n\nAnyway, I'm finally settled in with my new foster dad. The first week was a little scary because there were so many new smells and places. But I checked everything out and I really like my new home! Theres a big yard to run in when I get the zoomies and a couple sprinklers I can jump through when it's really hot outside. And I LOVE all the attention I'm getting being the only dog in the house.\n\nWhen my foster dad leaves during the day I get to take a nap in my crate with my Kong. He says I've learned to be a really good boy when he goes to work. Among other things, there's just so much to learn. While I may be a little slow, I'm really good at listening and following directions once I've learned something. Especially if there are treats involved!\n\nThat's it for now. I'll continue to work on my good behavior and try to not let my curiosity get me in trouble. I can't wait to meet more Hoomans because they all love me so please come visit! Stay tuned for more progress updates in the near future and stay safe.\n\n6/8/20: Hello everyone! My name is TonksI'm a stocky fella that loves being with my people. When I jump on the dog bed my favorite thing to do is roll around and rub myself on everything. I love napping, but I also love finding new things- I'm curious! When I came from the shelter, they thought I was around 3 years old, but the folks at CBR think I'm more of a middle aged guy. I like chasing the tennis ball but they say that's not great for my arthritis- I'm on some great supplements that are helping that some, but I'm not a guy that will need to be your running buddy. They think I spent a lot of my life before CBR by myself, so I'm looking for a home without any other pets- I like to have the attention of humans all to myself! I also sometimes like to give cats a run for their money (can you blame me?), so I need folks who can keep me calm on the leash or pick me up if I try to bolt for the kitties (I'm a smaller guy, so that's not too hard to do). The folks I'm with are working on teaching me manners and basic commands- they say I'm sort of a slow learner- they aren't sure if maybe in my past life I got a little injured in my head. Once I learn something though, I'm golden! I'm just looking for people who will be patient with me. I'm pretty good in the crate and housetrained, and apparently when I get excited I make little snorting piggy noises which the humans say is really cute.\n\nTonks is looking for a forever home with a family that will continue his training and will be patient, firm, and consistent with him to help him learn his manners. We know his family is out there!\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCome visit carolinaboxerrescue.org to learn more about me and see more pictures.

Once you're my friend, I'm all about the belly rubs! Other animals are still a challenge for me, and I'm working on leash behavior whenever dogs pass by. Making progress with treat redirection and looking at Foster Mom...one stroll at a time. Excited to work with a trainer this week! I'll be taking notes. Best suited for: a seasoned, assertive dog owner; no other pets; home a lot.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCome visit carolinaboxerrescue.org to learn more about me and see more pictures.

Our mission: To balance the health, safety, and welfare needs of Boxers in the Carolinas (and parts of Virginia and Georgia) by providing a loving and safe environment for stray, abused, impounded and owner surrendered dogs by placing them in foster homes and ultimately - forever homes.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDog's Name: Delilah\n\nDog's Approximate Age: 2 years\n\nGender: Female\n\nDog's Size: Pocket Boxer (under 50lbs as adult and healthy weight)\n\nDog's Weight: 47 pounds\n\nGood with small dogs?: No\n\nGood with big dogs?: No\n\nGood with cats?: No\n\nGood with kids?: Yes, older only (12 and over due to being too rambunctious)\n\nAny medical issues?: Heartworm Positive - being treated with slow kill method\n\nCrate trained?: Yes\n\nHouse trained?: Yes\n\nHeartworms?: Yes\n\n10/26/20:\nDelilah has come so far since this summer and we're very proud of her progress! We realized quickly she would act out from anxiety which amped her up and she didn't have the skills or confidence to calm and soothe herself. We also found that she had underlying allergies that were making her irritable and itchy. Zyrtec has been magic for her and while she no longer gets hives, we have noticed she'll chew her paws so consider wiping them down as needed. With some medicine, firm rules, and a whole lot of patience Delilah has come a very long way in just a few weeks. She is showing us a very sweet loving and playful personality. As a super chewer, antlers, Kongs and tough toys have really helped her relax. She LOVES having her own blankets to making nests in, and they are the one item we allow her to chew on as needed for comfort. By doing so we found her need to chew our soft furnishings drastically decrease. Having a crate will always be important for Delilah; it's her safe space and she sleeps there overnight. With time, we've been able to leave her out during the workday downstairs without worry; she just sits on the couch or on her bed. On the weekends we venture to Umstead or the Art Park for long walks. She does very well in the car when in the backseat; she will lean against the chair or curl up. It's important to know that in the trunk or way back she will get car sick. Delilah is learning how to tell us her needs and while she's getting better everyday there are times she gets \"stuck\" or when she steals shoes for attention if we ignore her too long. She also shows some separation anxiety and isn't quite sure what to do if she's super tired but everyone else is busy doing interesting things. Delilah's interest in other dogs is complicated. While she wags her tail and wines at other dogs passing by, she has had consistently negative introductions with them. She walks beautifully and other than sometimes \"sinking\" her body, she doesn't bark or lunge at other dogs so long as you're passing by. We have many dogs in our neighborhood and she couldn't care less when they bark through their windows or doors. But it is important Delilah is your only pet. She really needs a family who is willing to be patient, firm and flexible in the beginning. It's worth it to get to the big doe eyed sweet girl we've come to know.\n\n_____________________________________________________\n\n7/28/20: Hey! It's me, Delilah! I'm just loving these sunny summer days! Even if it's 90 degrees, I want to be outside laying in the sun or watching people walking by. My humans even put sunscreen on my nose! My favorite is when my people are outside with me. I'm right by their side at all times because I don't want to miss out if they stumble upon some treats. While they're working in the garden, I stand nearby and guard em. I also like when they're grilling because anything that drips on the ground is mine!\n\nWe also go for walks which help me get my energy out, but I get tired quickly. After 20 minutes, I can't keep my tongue in my mouth. I don't want to brag but I'm really good at walking on a leash. I stay right next to my human and don't pull. I used to get excited when I saw rabbits and charge after them but I don't do that anymore. I'd love to catch one someday but I know that our walks are not the time to do that.\n\nI'm happy with any people who love being outside, just like I do! It's supposed to rain later so I'm heading outside to work on my tan!\n\n6/12/20: Hey friends! This is Delilah a.k.a Deedee a.k.a Lil' D and I wanted to give everyone an update on all the fun stuff that's been happening in my life! I'm starting to learn the rules of the house and I'm getting better at following them. These humans have a magic mat and every time I lay on it, I get a treat! I'm talking good stuff like hot dogs, apples and peanut butter. I'm even picking up some new tricks too. I've mastered \"shake\" and \"twirl,\" but I'm still getting the hang of \"fetch\" and \"drop.\" If I come home with you, what tricks are you gonna teach me?\n\nDelilah shows a lot of friendly interest in our neighbor's dog (Husky), and may do well with a dog who is OK with a pushy, energetic sibling. She would just need opportunities to calm back down between playtimes, as once she gets overexcited, it's hard to bring her back down.\n\n5/4/20: Little Delilah here, reporting for doodie! 3 weeks have flown by at my new foster home! I'm the sweetest girl looking for a family that will be consistent in rules, give me lots of outdoor time, and has a sunny spot where I can nap. Inside, outside, doesn't matterif I can find a spot of sun, I'm going to nap there! I'm VERY good on a leash, especially if I know who's boss. I get a little over excited at times (who doesn't?!) but after some time to settle down in my kennel, I'm just fine. Other dogs and young kids might find me a bit much - I just want to go go go and don't understand when it's time to stop. I love toys, and dinner time is my favorite time of day. I'm perfectly happy to hand out and sleep in my kennel, I'm perfectly potty trained, I like to sleep in and am not picky about a morning routine; it's just my evenings that need to be a little more structured. Not to brag, but I think I'm pretty smart. I'm a quick learner! In just the three short weeks here, I've learned some fun new tricks, like how to wait patiently for my dinner, \"tough\", and \"down\".\n\n2/25/20: Very energetic happy girl. She loves walking, running and exploring. Absolutely loves her stuffed animals and loves to play. Great with people and seems very fond of men.\n\n12/25/19: Delilah is a 2 year old high energy dog who is looking for a home where she can play a lot in a fenced backyard or go on nice long walks. She would also make a good running buddy! Because she has a lot of energy, we think she would be best in a home with kids 12 and over. She is selective about dogs, so she would like to be the \"queen bee\" of your house. She is crate and house trained, rarely barks, and knows basic commands. She's wondering... could you be her forever family?\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCome visit carolinaboxerrescue.org to learn more about me and see more pictures.

I'm not sure about thunderstorms and fireworks, I will snuggle close and tight next to you till its over. You will have to tell me its going to be ok. I've not been by myself (except 2 stays at the vet) since being rescued. I always had my sisters around or mom and dad. Dad has left me out of my kennel for several hours at a time with 1 or 2 of my sisters and I do great. You will have to help me get better with boy dogs I still get little too excited. I can do it, with your help. I don't know what a cat is so I don't know how I will do. I sure will miss my foster mom and dad, they have been great to me.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\n8/17/20: Hey everyone it's Niko. I've had to settle down since getting my first HW shot but I still have another 30 days of rest after my last shots later this month. Im not looking forward to the shots they make me sick to my stomach and I don't feel well for a couple days after. One good thing is I've learned to cuddle and I love it. When I was sick from my shots my foster dad snuggled with me and told me the stories from his other Boxers and he would rub my belly till I fell asleep, snoring and all. I went to work with foster dad till I started feeling better. I love laying on the floor while my foster dad watches youtube and rubs my belly, sometimes he is on the couch but most of the time he is on the floor next to me. Im not a big fan of toys but I do love frozen beef bones and rawhides till they get too small for me. My sister Izzy showed me how to play with a kong that is filled with treats. It took me awhile to figure out that my kong had treats in it, I would just eat my sisters treats from her kong while she played with it. I love blueberries, dried pineapple but most of all I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE cheese puffs. Foster dad has been using these treats to help me learn stay and come and sometimes he just tells me how great I am and kisses my head for being an A-MAZE-ING boy. I follow him around all over the house, he has been teaching me to stay while he leaves the room till he gets back. He says it will help me not to follow around the house and that he will come back. My buddy Mason comes to see me a lot and we watch wrestling on TV. One day he brought his brother Luke over. Luke and I became the WDW (world diaper wrestling) undisputed intercontinental tag team cage match champions of the world. We beat the former champs (Woody, Buzz Light year and Mason) in a handicap one fall no time limit match. That was a lot of fun. Check on me soon, I'll be ready soon after my last HW treatment. NIKO, out.\n\n6/23/20: Hey, it's Niko checking in on Father's Day. My foster dad is the best dad EVER!! When I thought it could not get any better, just sayin'. I met a couple new boys since I last wrote, Alston (12) and Luke (3). Even though Alston is not a dog person (I don't know why) he helped me learn by letting me sit in the same room with him and not pet or rub me. Foster dad said not all people like dogs and its ok, I need to practice my manners anyway. Luke was a hand full with all his squealing and running around, I did my best to keep up with him. I had to help save my foster dad when he rides this thing that sounds like a dinosaur. He brings it out in the yard to feed it, it chews up the grass. It must be very powerful cause it goes around in circles with FD on top of it. I run to help him by nipping on its black feet its ferocious and growls back at me while it eats, but I'm not afraid of it. FD tells me that he is ok. He let me sniff it when he put it back in its cage FD calls it a shed. Its belly must have been full cause it made no more dinosaur noise. We have another loud animal I've never seen before- this one is kept in the house in a smaller room, Its not as loud as the shed dinosaur. FD fights with this one everyday, they start on the kitchen and work their way into the living room. It lunges forward and FD pulls it back it lunges forward and he pulls it back, this goes on for 20 minutes. I go into hero mode and try to nip at its one eye in the middle of its head. It must not see to well cause this thing has a bright light for a eye. FD fights that thing all by himself, FD always wins. Then he puts it back in its cage he calls it a closet. My foster sisters are doing well, thanks for asking. Since going to daycare I get to play with all 3 in the backyard. They get in a kiddy pool when they get hot, I'm not too sure about doing that just yet. I'm eating with all of my sisters at the same elevated food bowl station. FD is teaching us all to wait till he places the food down, sometimes I just can't wait. Daycare is a BLAST, I can't believe we just get to play all day. I have to work on playing well with other boy dogs, sometimes I get too excited. I just finished some medicine for my heart worms, soon I'll have to go get some shots. 2 shots will be back to back with no break. I'll have to keep calm for a couple weeks after the first one. Wish me luck, FD says we will be working on my listening, staying, down and come here commands during that time. He says we are going on some field trips before the shots, he is going to take me in some stores around town. Check me out soon, have a great doggy fathers day. Maybe this time next year I'll have a mom and dad to celebrate with. NIKO OUT!\n\n6/1/20: Hey!! Its Niko, BUSY, BUSY, BUSY! It sure is nice to get out and do things, I didn't know how great life was as a D-O-G! I have had a lot of new experiences since last time. Foster dad has taken me to work on the Army base funny place though, they all wear the same clothes and have the same haircuts thats weird. They all love to rub me and tell me how smart I am. They let me watch their classes while my foster dad talks and teaches them how to fix boo boos and ouchies. The car rides are awesome, I love to look out the window and see things pass by, never a dull moment. I get to play with my foster sisters in the house, they are a BLAST to play with. Lucy and Izzy are bigger and younger than me while Bella is a older and smaller than me. Life has been so great with them in it, thats for sure!! My foster dad puts me on a leash and he lets me take him for walks, then I take him home and he rubs me telling me I did great! I get to sleep at night with everybody and I have no accidents,oh yea! Im learning how to sleep in my own comfy bed, 3 words A-MAZE-ING I sleep like a baby. I like when they put me and my foster sisters in our kennels during the day, I get to catch up on naps till foster dad or mom comes home. The Doctors who take care of me are great Im not afraid of them at all, I thought I would be. They look at me with bright lights and listen to me breath and I think its just fun. Ive got to play with some kids and make new friends too, Mason who is 10 loves to play with me. Naomi who is 16 isn't afraid of me AT ALL, imagine that. I get to take her for walks too, WHAT! Foster dad says Im gonna meet some more kids soon. Im learning to share water and food with my sisters, thats one thing I never had to do by myself is share, so its baby steps for me. I had my neuter today and feel little lost if you know what I mean. Foster dad says I'll be just fine as he kisses my head and scratches my belly. I'll get to go to daycare and play with a bunch of dogs soon, ALL DAY! Im excited. Well you can see I've been busier than a one legged cat in a litter box. Im learning, thats for sure. Anyway, just checking in. Check up on me soon, I'll have more great adventures and pictures too.\n\n5/24/20: Hi everybody!! My name is Niko. The kindness of one special person got me out of a bad place and in the loving care of CBR. Her children said you can't save every dog and she told them I can save this one. To that special person, THANK YOU I won't let you down. My new start in life is because of YOU!! My nub has not stopped wagging since I left that place. I am brand new at being a family member and I'm trying my best to see and try new things every day. I want to run and play with all 3 of my foster sisters but I get so excited I can only play with one at a time while on a leash. Foster dad says I'll get better after I'm... neutered? Anyway, I'll be ready for my FUR-ever family soon. I have scars on my face and neck that tells my past but not my future. Watch for my updates to see what new things and experiences I learn!!\n\n_____________",

She is not a good only dog. She has to have some other dogs to keep her busy and a couple human kids would be great.  She is sweet and laid back most of the time.  Only time she is not so laid back is when chaos starts.  She will growl and bark if the atmosphere  gets to wild and crazy.  She loves to play with toys and will motherly keep control of all other dogs in the area.  She likes to take long walks in the park if it is not too hot.  Aria is a \"Black Brindle\", so she is more black than brindle and does get hot easily in the summer months.  She will love you forever if you get her a kiddy pool to lay in when outside to play.  She would love a quiet scheduled household, and another younger dog that she could boss around.  She loves to take naps and would not mind at all if she had her own special blanket and pillow for sleepovers.  Please feel free to inquire about Aria,  She is a one of a kind girl!\n*****Not Good With Cats or small fluffy animals****",

He came through his recent neuter and much needed dental like a champ and is nearly house trained.  He does need a home with a 5-6 foot fence to keep him contained. He is really the most amazing loving dog and we hope we can find him the perfect home soon.\n\n\nHoss is a partially blind Lemon and White English Pointer. He is around 9 years old and was surrendered to the local shelter because he was having some fireworks anxiety at home. This is a common issue with many dogs. He is a very sweet boy and is doing great in foster care, learning about TLC and also loving being able to sleep indoors. We are taking our time with his care and he will need a very special adoptive home.\n\nYou can also message me here or call Lisa at 630-694-1359 for more information about adoption.",

She was born in September 2016 and is a happy 3 year old.\n\nShe's looking for a very experienced adoptive home that can work with her and keep her safe.  She's enthusiastic about everything she does.  (Lately that's digging!)  She is interested in playing with other dogs, but her cues and enthusiasm can be misunderstood - for those reasons, we'd prefer for her to be an only dog.  She has a strong prey drive and cannot be placed with cats.  She's crate trained.\n\nShe's spayed, microchipped, heartworm negative and up-to-date on vaccines.  If you'd like to learn more about her, call or text Jody at 352-316-5155 or email her at 2ndChRescue@gmail.com.",

Bronco has spent time living in a home before, so he knows his way around the house and does very well when left alone. He walks nicely on a leash, knows his basic commands, and is a polite treat-taker. Bronco's been described as ridiculously silly, and while he can be a bit shy when first meeting new people, give him a chance to warm up and his goofy, affectionate personality will soon show itself, and he'll be rolling over for belly rubs in no time. He's also an expert at chasing a tennis ball. Returning the ball? Well, he could use some work on that, but he does like a good game of keep-away. Bronco has lived with medium-large dogs and wouldn't mind sharing a home with them again. He seems to be a versatile dog who could succeed in a variety of home environments. Come meet him!",

She's only a few years old and she is actually quite pretty but she needs a lot of help behaviorally.  Cookie is great with all other dogs because she came from a place with so many other dogs around but she didn't get the same socialization with people.  She is quite scared of people and she will need a lot of patience and understanding.  Cookie also shuts down on leash so she will need work with that as well.  We know that Cookie has a long way to go but we really hope that there is someone out there with the patience needed to help this sweet girl trust so she can have a happy, stress free life.",

            "description": "Chance was transferred to our rescue from Kendall County Animal control. He was not handling life in a kennel very well and needed foster care. Chance is a senior guy estimated to be 10-11yrs old. He is a huge lap dog! Always wants to be by your side or in your lap! He needs a home in which someone is always home as he gets separation anxiety. He has some hearing loss and gets anxious when no one is home, will tip over garbage, get in to things he should not. He has a fear of crates, and needs a home where he will not be crated. He is obssessive with his favorite toys. Might be ok with another calm dog his size or larger. He is not good with small dogs or cats. He still enjoys walks, but shorter walks as his arthritis is starting to slow him down. He loves all people. We would caution anyone with small children due to his size, he could easily knock over a little one. He is neutered, up to date on vaccines, he is overall healthy for his age, microchipped, HW negative. Just a big senior love bug. his adoption fee is $175 Please complete application for adoption at furangelsas.com",

            "description": "Born February 9, 2020 Lily aka Lily Bear, Lily Bell is a female German Shepherd mix seeking a forever home! This girl is a huge cuddle bug! She's that old saying Sweet and Spice and everything nice! She is spunky, lots of energy, sassy, and playful. You pick her up to hold her she usually cuddles right into your arms like a baby. She even reaches for you, with her front paws, if she wants you to hold her. Lily\u2019s ideal family would be an active one who would include her in adventures like hiking, running and camping. Lily loves kids and want to be part of the action wherever she goes!\n\nLily has Megaesophagus which is a medical condition effecting the esophagus, which is the muscular tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. She eats her meals in a custom built Bailey chair so she can remain upright 20-30 minutes after each meal. After that, she is right back to her puppy antics! Families who have adopted dogs with Megaesophagus report that the feeding process it is pretty easy and routine after you get the hang of it.\n\nLily currently lives with several other dogs and one elusive cat. She is kennel trained, and currently learning how to ring a bell to let her people know she wants to go outside. Lily knows basic commands but gets excited and forgets sometimes. She definitely has the German Shepherd smarts and is highly trainable. Lily is leash trained and loves walks and car rides. \n\nAll large and/or active dogs will require a full fenced (6ft) secure yard. \nNo children under 5. \n\nLike all Mikey's Chance dogs, this dog will come to you from a foster home that has provided loving one-on-one attention, socialization and some basic training, as well as quality food and exercise. \n\nApplications can be found at www.mikeyschance.com and completed on a computer, tablet, and/or phone. Please note that adopters are not chosen on a first come, first served basis, but full consideration is given to the best fit for the dog AND the adopter. Applications can take up to 3 weeks to process. Application submission DO NOT guarantee approval for adoption.",

Thanks for understanding!****\n\nMeet Laika! She is a full blooded 4 year old Boxer.  Laika is a super sweet little girl but she is an alpha female.  She plays rough and gets jealous easy so she needs to be in a home without another dog.  She loves to run and play and she is a total couch potato.  Laika has been adopted and returned twice because she is a fence climber and a car chaser.  SHE has to be adopted to a family with a 6 to 8 foot wooden fenced yard.  Please do not message us with interest in Laika if you do not have a fully wooden fenced backyard.  This will be a requirement in her placement.  This is for your safety and hers.  She is really a sweet heart - she loves people and has been around kids of all ages and does amazing.  She is spayed, vaccinated, microchipped, and heartworm negative.  Laika deserves the perfect placement. Please if you are interest in adopting this baby girl, email us at LongJ1003@aol.com and Katybug6067@gmail.com.  Thanks for opting to adopt a rescue pooch!",

            "description": "Juliet (aka Chubs) is around 3 years old and weighs approximately 40-45 pounds. She is a small gal. She's shy, skittish even, and will require adopters that are full of patience and compassion to help her work on her confidence. She is under-socialized and not suitable for a home that will require her to be friendly and social with people. She is not aggressive by any means; she is just afraid of new situations and her impulse is to hide. We'd prefer a home that has had experience with dogs and understands her body language when she is uncomfortable; we don't believe she should be a first-time dog. She needs a secure yard with no gaps or holes she can slip out of or underneath. Juliet is as gentle as can be. She is good with other dogs, though doesn't play much with them. She has initiated play, but it will take time. She would be good with kids over the age of 10 years old. She would do best with no kids or with calm kids who won't roughhouse with her, as she is a shy dog. Juliet is loving and doting with her family and will make a great companion with time. She is crate-trained, but will need patience from her adopters to work with her on her leash-training. Juliet was found in the middle of the desert  with her puppies who were around two weeks old at the time, where she had given birth under a pile of rocks. The family's rescue can be viewed on our Instagram page (@poochmatch). All of her puppies have since been adopted. Now it's time for her turn! Her adoption fee is $295 and covers the cost of her spay, all core vaccines (Rabies and Distemper/Parvo), microchip and microchip registration. If you\u2019re interested in adopting, the first step is completing an adoption application which is available on our website, Poochmatch.com, under the adoption tab. Please read the following paragraphs for additional information about our process.\n\nIf this listing is still posted, we are still accepting applications for him/her. We do not do out-of-state adoptions on highly adoptable dogs; we would only consider out-of-state adoptions for dogs that prove hard-to-place locally. We cannot hold dogs, please submit your application when you are ready to adopt.\n\nUPDATE: ADOPTION EVENTS CANCELLED DUE TO PANDEMIC AND SOCIAL DISTANCING. If you are interested in meeting any Poochmatch dog at our weekly adoption event on Saturdays at the Petsmart in Yorba Linda, CA (5521 Mirage St.) between 1-5 PM, please fill out an application from our website, poochmatch.com, and submit it no later than 11 AM on Fridays. Upon receipt AND approval, the dog you are interested in meeting will be made available to meet on a Saturday. Due to the high volume of dogs and puppies in our foster homes, it is impossible to bring them all every Saturday. The only way to ensure that the dog that you are interested in will be at the adoption event is to FILL OUT AN APPLICATION AND BE APPROVED. Otherwise, we cannot guarantee that the dog you are interested in will be at our adoption event. If you cannot make the time frame of our events, appointments can be made at another time and location solely at the discretion of the foster parent. Please understand that private appointments will be coordinated to meet the convenience of the foster parent/transporter.\n\nAll adoption fees cover the mandatory and non-negotiable spay/neuter, rabies, microchip, microchip registration, full sets of core vaccinations (rabies and 1 set of distemper/parvo for adults, 4 for puppies) and deworming. Adoption fees vary based on age, breed, size and the costs incurred on the dog's behalf by us i.e. medical, behavioral training, etc. and they range from $225-$495.\n\n\nCOVID-19 PROCEDURE:\nIn an effort to create a safe environment for our potential adopters and our staff, we have changed our protocols and procedures during these difficult times. Starting immediately, our procedures will change from what\u2019s written on our website and other social media platforms. Our weekly adoption event at the Petsmart in Yorba Linda is temporarily cancelled due to COVID-19 and social distancing. The only way to meet one of the dogs/puppies we have available for adoption is through completion of our adoption application through our website, poochmatch.com, before 11 AM on Fridays. On Fridays when we review the applications, we will pick the best fit for each dog or puppy applied for and coordinate mutually agreeable appointment times for the applicants who are approved that week. Private appointments are currently only scheduled on Wednesday, Thursday or Saturday of each week. Masks or bandanas are mandatory; faces must be properly covered.\n\nWith the overwhelming desire of the public to adopt at this time, we have received as many as 30 applications for one dog in just one week. Working with a staff of volunteers, we are only able to reach out on Fridays to the people we have approved to adopt. If you have not heard from us by Friday, we have selected a different applicant. If you have multiple dogs/puppies that you are interested in, please indicate each dog/puppy of interest on the application at that time so we don\u2019t rule you out for another dog/puppy available for adoption.\n\nPlease understand, we have an influx of texts, phone calls and emails that makes it impossible to get to each and every one of you. Not just for adoption interest, but also from veterinarians, people who must relinquish dogs, people who have found a stray dog in need of pick up, etc. We are currently not in need of fosters. Due to the fact that there is such a high demand, we are sticking with strict protocol to not adopt out of Southern California. We apologize for this inconvenience and difficulty to be able to get in touch with us while there is an overwhelming desire and demand to adopt at this time. We appreciate your understanding and patience as we navigate through these difficult times with every intention to keep the public and our staff safe.",

There have been an overwhelming number of applications, all who have been absolutely wonderful people who have been a pleasure for us to meet, but with Bear's special needs, it is our duty to see he gets what is right for him.\n\nBear is approximately 15-years-old and does have arthritis in his legs, so he will need a home without stairs, and a yard that he can go for potty breaks and to bathe in the sunshine.\n\nHe has a very sweet nature, but craves constant human affection. We ideally would like to find someone who could be with him at home all day, and see him through for the rest of his golden years. Bear may become overwhelmed with children so a home without kids and other pets would be best.\n\nBear is a very special dog. He was very loyal to his guardian and even waited by him for a week after his passing before he was found. This loss has shattered him, so we know we have to find him a new best friend soon to shower him with love and care.\n\nCould you be Bear's hero?",

If you don\u2019t have another dog and are open to two dogs, we have her best friend Pickles for adoption, also on our site.\n3)Sophie must have someone who is home during the day...either works from home, stay at home mom or retired.       \n4)Adoptive Home must be in Atlanta area, no exceptions.      \n5)Sophie needs an owner who has raised and house trained a dog, she is not completely housebroken and needs someone home often and with experience training a dog.\n\nSophie is 1-2 year old female Chihuahua mixed possibly with rat terrier. She\u2019s both adorable and outgoing. This darling girl was living in a filthy pen outside and finally rescued out of that depressing situation and is very grateful!\n\nSophie is currently at a boarding kennel until she\u2019s adopted. \nShe is not completely house trained and must have an owner who\u2019s home during the day and who has plenty of experience house training a dog.\n\nSophie is very loving and very playful. She loves to be held, loves to carry her toys around and of course loves playing! She\u2019s spayed and current on vaccines and a healthy girl.\n\nNo older, senior dogs and no big dogs please.\n\nWe do not adopt out of state. Atlanta adoptions only.",

He is a big beefy dude with all of the love and loyalty to match!\nHe spent the first 9 years of his life as an outside chained dog until his angel rescued him and got him healthy. He's now 10 years old and we are helping him find that low key home made for senior dogs who deserve to be spoiled and loved like there is no tomorrow! Desi definitely deserves to be treated like a king for his golden years!!\n\nDesi is great with kids 10+ and since he has spent no time with children younger than that his entire life we would not recommend him learning to love toddlers or young children at his age. He loves human affection and his ideal home would have no other animals in it and a fenced yard so he doesn't have to be tethered or chained ever again! He is a strong walker and non reactive to other dogs but in his home can be a little jealous or possessive of other animals affection etc... so again... just to give him his absolute best and stress-free senior years we really would love to see him as the only animal in the home.\n\nOnce you meet this big guy it will be love at first sight - he is such a goofball with a fun playful personality and just loves to be by people despite not having that for the majority of his life. \n\nPlease contact us if you're interested in discussing Desi :)\n\nAdoption Process: PLEASE READ!\nAnyone interested in meeting our adoptables must complete an online application, which is located on our website. This site is updated weekly so if an animal is listed they are available for adoption. Once the application is approved we will set up a meet and greet with the animal to ensure a good fit and then before adoption is complete we will schedule a home check to ensure a safe environment for the animal you are looking to adopt. If you live outside of the Tri-County area we will do our best to accommodate a home visit but it will rely on the availability and volunteers at that time. At this time we cannot do out of the state adoptions. We also do not do on-the-spot adoptions and we do not adopt out animals by a first-come, first-serve basis. We strive to fit everyone of our animals to the best match possible! We pride ourselves in responsibly placing animals in homes that are best fit for their needs.\n\nwww.redemptionrescuemi.com",

With all this personality there is no room to share his home with any other pets and would do best in a home that has previous dog experience and no small children. Zilla is very treat motivated and ready to show off his smarts!! This guy already knows the commands sit, shake, lay down, stay and outside and with a few treats in hand we are sure he will easily learn even more. Zilla loves playing with toys, going out for walks and being the passenger on car rides. Are you the family Zilla has been waiting for? Apply for adoption today!!",

He has the typical beautiful looks of a Pyr, complete with a lovely fluffy coat that makes him look even more handsome, and also the piercing blue eyes of a Husky that garners your attention and eternal love. Still young and full of playfulness, Jesse is an energetic boy who prefers to be on the go at all times. These days, he absolutely loves rolling around in the snow with his foster siblings! Jesse will thrive in an active family where his people are dedicated to meeting his needs - training classes where he can learn new skills and channel his energy in a positive manner will ensure that he receives adequate mental stimulation. He will need a patient, experienced owner to work with him on resource guarding, although he will 'trade' if given the opportunity. While Jesse can seem to be an independent boy, there is no doubt that he enjoys the company of his foster siblings and/or favorite people. If you are an outdoor enthusiast, Jesse will be your best buddy to keep you company on all your adventures!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nView full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can call 877-739-3582 or email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed. \n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

I'm looking for a mellow family to vibe with!\n\nI'm good around other dogs, especially if they're relaxed and easygoing. Let's do a meet and greet with your pack to make sure we're all happy. I also love kids! I would do best with kiddos who are calm and gentle around dogs. \n\nI have some crate anxiety, but structure and occasional CBD work wonders for me. I love being around my people, and I feel much better once I know they'll always come back for me.\n\nI love my toys, especially chasing tennis balls! (But you're gonna have to fetch it yourself. I can't be expected to do EVERYTHING around here!) Puzzles are my favorite and I work hard to solve them. I also love to learn new stuff. I got a big brain and I know how to use it!\n\nI can't wait to meet you and give you five million kisses before committing to a life-long snuggle session. Apply to meet me now!\n\n**Punkin's adoption fee has been 100% sponsored by a Good Human**",

She absolutleyu loves her daughter, Midnight, and they play and have a good time together even though she is almost grown up. Although Mabella is very comfortable taking treats and willingly sits close by to be petted, she is timid about walking on a leash. She would love to have someone spend time with her to help her get over her concerns. Mabella is friendly, but just gets suspicious when the leash starts to pull on her neck. But if you have a little patience, or don't plan on going for walks right away, then Mabella would be happy to be your companion and stay by your side.",

When I arrived I had an enlarged prostate  and I was peeing and pooping uncontrollably. I am now wearing a disposable belly band since I was neutered. Sometimes it seems at times to go through the motions of going to the bathroom but I still am Incontinent. It could improve or not over time, just have no way of knowing how much and or when.  I am a really sweet boy just craving love and attention. I am Good with other dogs and indifferent to the cat. After all I have been through my foster Mom says I am still pretty Peppy and energetic and attentive boy looking for someone to accept him just as I am and love me. \nIf you could be that someone for me, please fill out an application on the rescue's website www.floprva.org This rescue gives us seniors a chance for a good life and we are true treasures.\nLove, \nPeeWee xo",

She is now back at HSW looking for forever home.\n\n*FOSTER OR FOREVER HOME WANTED!*\n\nSay hello to Zoey! This 9 year old mystery mix girl came into our shelter as a stray. She is super sweet, loving, and very playful for a senior girl! Zoey does need to be the only animal in her foster or forever home. She has lots of love to give and life left to live, she just needs to find her perfect forever family! \n  \nZoey is in need of a foster or an adoptive home ASAP.  The more we spread the word the more this sweet girl has a chance of finding someone to foster her for 2 weeks - a month.  \n\nZoey needs a foster to recover from a much-needed surgery for a growth on her chest.  The Vet will perform the surgery on her as soon as she has a foster or adoptive home because unfortunately the shelter environment is not conducive to her recovery.\nAll vet and other expenses will be covered by the shelter and the very generous souls who made donations towards her surgery and recovery.\n\nAfter her recovery, she will go back to the shelter and be looking for her FUREVER HOME.  Unless it is a foster-to-adopt...hopefully?\n\nBelow is a link to youtube video with shelter Manager Cait explaining in more detail.  (It's 6 minutes ahead if you want to fast forward ahead) But please feel free to watch the whole video and SUBSCRIBE  to the Walden Humane Society's channel.   https://youtu.be/mSexzZX8IGA\n\n",

She lived most of her life out on a chain before she was taken to a high kill shelter where she had 10 days or less to get adopted or rescued.  Older pits who have lived on chains are not in high demand .. but we saw her face and could not let her die.  So we pulled her and that was in November of 2018.\n\nRita was of course a little unsure of people and other dogs, so we had to put her in our indoor / outdoor kennel.  Over the last 2 years she has blossomed so much.  She was a strong heart worm positive when we pulled her, but she has been treated and is now heart worm negative and on monthly preventions.  She is of course spayed and up to date on her vaccinations.  She is about 60 lbs of solid love!  She has been introduced to other dogs and does well with dogs her size that are not alphas and is happy to run and play in a fenced yard.  She would also do well as an only dog.\n\nWe hope there is a special adopter out there who will give Rita the life she deserves and have a lot of time and patience for her as she transitions to living inside a home.  A home with a fenced yard and doggy door access to the yard would be the most ideal or someone who is home who can let her in and out as needed through out the day.  She is a bit of a snuggle butt .. so be prepared for lots of love and affection as well.  A physically fenced yard is a must!  I would think she would be fine with kids 8 or older just because of her size and when she gets excited she can get a bit hyper lol.\n\nRita is a great dog, she needs a great family to step up and continue to be her rescue hero!  We have done what was needed to get her healthy and ready, now it is time for a family to say \u201cwe want to give Rita the life she was always meant to have\u201d. \n\nYou will find videos of Rita on our Facebook page as well if you want to see some of her earlier posts.  She is a happy girl looking or a happy life!  https://www.facebook.com/806737346045826/videos/2269299646644495/?v=2269299646644495\n\nRita is currently located in Tennessee and the adoption fee is $150.  The first step in our process is submitting the application.  We are happy to set up a meet and greet once an application has been approved. If you would like to adopt Rita please fill out our online adoption application at http://safehaventn.com/ .  \n",

I'm a good boy because I know my house manners and I am the best boy when I'm on my leash.  I'm still kind of young and impressionable, and I want to learn all the rest of the good stuff when I get to my new home.  There's really not much I don't like - well, except other pets.  I like being the one and only!  That's because I've got all the love you'll need.  We can cuddle on the couch to binge your favorite show, we can be running pals, and we can be the best of friends!  Send an email to adoption@wilco.org and tell my shelter friends you want meet me!",

My name is Gizmo and I am a cute little 8-year-old girl. I am just 5 lbs and my foster believes I am a Shih Tzu mix. I was found alone on the streets and my kind foster took me in, however, I need a home where I will be loved forever. I love going on long fast walks and also staying right next to you. I do bark at other dogs, I'm very small and need them to know not to mess with me. I am very smart and I am potty trained. My favorite activity is cuddling. The vet has given me a clean bill of health except that I have a cataract in one eye. Even so, I manage perfectly and I can see well. I am tiny and sometimes I am afraid of loud noises and other dogs so a home without dogs would be best for me. Adopt me and let's cuddle together!\n\nIf you would like to meet me please visit our website at www.bichonrescueoc.org and submit an application to start the adoption process! All our pups are available as long as their listing is up. The adoption process moves very quickly and most families are approved within 48 hours.\n\nIn the struggle to cope with COVID-19 and its effects on our daily life, it has become necessary to suspend our customary adoption approval process. Scheduling your \"Home Safety Evaluation\" and a \"Meet and Greet\" presents a significant challenge. If you express an interest in adopting this Special Needs pup, we will make every effort to make that possible. You will be contacted to schedule a telephone interview and details of the current approval process will be explained.",

            "description": "Tuspots is a beloved creature living at DCAS. Most individuals that know Tuspots love him for his impressionable quirks, his beautiful smile, and his goofy personality. Once Tuspots feels comfortable around you, he just blossoms, he wants to show off his skills, wants to give and receive affection, and he trusts you. Tuspots has a fun-loving side that enjoys outdoor adventures like flower-filled hikes or playing games with you in the yard (burying toy treasures, tug of war, and chase me are his favorites!). Tuspots has been participating in playgroups here and loves to play with other dogs. He also has a laidback side and enjoys resting on a bench and receiving all the headscratches and bellyrubs he can get! He will sit with you peacefully until you are ready to leave. Tuspots is a great listener, walks well on leash, gives great eye contact, sits for treats, takes treats gently, and has no issues being handled or petted by so many of us that have his trust. Sometimes it takes a handler a couple days to vibe with Tuspots and sometimes it only takes a few seconds for a stranger to feed him a treat and gain his understanding. It will always be best for Tuspots to take introductions and visits with new people slowly, because he does not always feel comfortable right away. Tuspots definitely needs a home that will understand his social needs. Tuspots is doing his best to work through his fears, and needs all the love and patience he can get. This boy has such a deep, beautiful soul and such a zest for life! Tuspots will make your heart melt and your cheeks hurt from smiling!\n\nMeet him at Dekalb Animal Services, 3280 Chamblee Dunwoody Rd, Chamblee, GA OR go to dekalbanimalservices.com",

So if you would like a lover of a dog and have no other pets so that you can flower her with attention, she could be your perfect companion.  Fern has a lot of energy so a fenced in yard is needed.\n\nYou can try a foster to adopt---she needs an adopter or foster home ASAP.  \n\nSo, maybe you can at least provide a nice home for her until she finds her forever family?\n\nThe adoption fee includes age-appropriate vaccinations, heartworm test, spay/neuter and microchip!\n\nPlease click on the link for our:\nOnline Adoption Application:  https://paawarren.org/adopt/adoption-application-form/\nAdoption Info:  https://paawarren.org/adopt/adoption-fees/\nWebsite and other info:  https://paawarren.org/\n",

We first met Tickles when assisting an overcrowding situation in East Texas. She has since been fully vetted including spayed, microchipped, and vaccinations. Tickles needs an adjustment time in any new place with new people. She does not fully understand that people equal belly scratches and lovins. We are working on house breaking but she seems to do well with crating at night.\n\nFor more information: Adopt@spcaeasttx.com\nFor adoption: www.spcaeasttx.com",

            "description": "Dante is a handsome Malinois around 3-4 years of age who is full of quirky personality and love.\n\nDante has mellowed a bit with his age but still does everything in true Malinois fashion with lots of zeal and passion. He enjoys meeting new people and is a generally social boy when out in public or at home. He has always been sweet and affectionate with new volunteers however he can also be vocal and demanding when he wants to play. He is generally more concerned with his toy(s) though and finding someone to throw them for him - if he can't find someone to do it he will do it himself. Asking for what he wants, or just taking it, isn't a problem for Dante who routinely swipes bowls or cooking sheets to play with at his whim - chasing metal objects is his favorite thing in the world and he cause of his very worn teeth. Dante has been living with a child who is very dog savvy and won an unsure Dante over but he has not been exposed to any kids under 6 years of age. We would not recommend him for a home with young children or children that are unsure of big, vocal dogs. Dante is a stereotypical Malinois who will eat the house around him if left to his own devices without boundaries and clear expectations. Although he isn't as intense as some Malinois can be Dante would be best suited to a home that understands working dog breeds.\n\nDante has been fostered with other dogs with no issues. He is much more concerned with what he can get his mouth on and not so much what the other dogs are doing. He is not one to play with other dogs as they simply aren't his interest. He tends to be non-confrontational and will even move to another toy if one of the other dogs swipes his toy. He is not submissive though and doesn't tolerate being pushed around by other dogs. He is a middle line personality in the play yard and has walked with dogs as small as 12 lbs (puppies) and large as 90 + lb Shepherds without issue. Dante does have a strong drive though and is NOT recommended for a home with cats.\n\nDante is searching for a home that will appreciate his quirky personality and keep him on track as a well mannered Malinois. If you're the home for Dante email us at Tierhavenrescue@gmail.com for an adoption application or visit tierhaven.rescuegroups.org for FAQs including adoption fee and process.",

Instead of roses, he will be giving out free kisses to whoever wins his heart.\n\nFun fact: Jax's head is so big that it's the only thing the camera would focus on.

Who wouldn't want a pup as sweet, loyal, and funny as Jax?  And Jax is the lucky recipient of an Adoption Angel's generosity, thanks to Amy Kobza, Broker Associate with Realty TEXAS Better Life Team, and now his fee has been paid!

            "description": "Bison is approximately 8 years old and weighs around 65 pounds. He is friendly, sweet and sociable. He is loving and embraces affection. He LOVES getting pets and head scratches! He is a gentle giant and very well-mannered. He does well with other large breed dogs, though he tends to get picked on since he is pretty submissive. He would do best as an only dog or with an equally sweet canine companion. He does well when taking walks past other dogs and hasn't shown us any reactivity. He would do great with kids and is very sweet with humans. Bison is wonderful with people and very welcoming. He may bark at the door, but is friendly with visitors. He is well-behaved and non-destructive. He is doing well with crate-training and leash-training, though prefers to explore the yard. He is doing well at using the restroom outdoors. He was relinquished by his owners who couldn't bring him with them to their new home. He came to us with a bump on his eyelid. It was removed an biopsied and came back negative for anything harmful. Bison is feeling much better and is a very good boy and will be the best companion! His adoption fee is $295 which covers the cost of his eyelid procedure, neuter, all core vaccines (Rabies and Distemper/Parvo), microchip and microchip registration. If you\u2019d like to be considered for adoption, the first step is completing an application which is available on our website, poochmatch.com, under the adoption tab. Please read the below paragraphs for more information on our process.\n\nIf this listing is still posted, we are still accepting applications for him/her. We do not do out-of-state adoptions on highly adoptable dogs; we would only consider out-of-state adoptions for dogs that prove hard-to-place locally. We cannot hold dogs, please submit your application when you are ready to adopt.\n\nUPDATE: ADOPTION EVENTS CANCELLED DUE TO PANDEMIC AND SOCIAL DISTANCING. If you are interested in meeting any Poochmatch dog at our weekly adoption event on Saturdays at the Petsmart in Yorba Linda, CA (5521 Mirage St.) between 1-5 PM, please fill out an application from our website, poochmatch.com, and submit it no later than 11 AM on Fridays. Upon receipt AND approval, the dog you are interested in meeting will be made available to meet on a Saturday. Due to the high volume of dogs and puppies in our foster homes, it is impossible to bring them all every Saturday. The only way to ensure that the dog that you are interested in will be at the adoption event is to FILL OUT AN APPLICATION AND BE APPROVED. Otherwise, we cannot guarantee that the dog you are interested in will be at our adoption event. If you cannot make the time frame of our events, appointments can be made at another time and location solely at the discretion of the foster parent. Please understand that private appointments will be coordinated to meet the convenience of the foster parent/transporter.\n\nAll adoption fees cover the mandatory and non-negotiable spay/neuter, rabies, microchip, microchip registration, full sets of core vaccinations (rabies and 1 set of distemper/parvo for adults, 4 for puppies) and deworming. Adoption fees vary based on age, breed, size and the costs incurred on the dog's behalf by us i.e. medical, behavioral training, etc. and they range from $225-$495.\n\n\nCOVID-19 PROCEDURE:\nIn an effort to create a safe environment for our potential adopters and our staff, we have changed our protocols and procedures during these difficult times. Starting immediately, our procedures will change from what\u2019s written on our website and other social media platforms. Our weekly adoption event at the Petsmart in Yorba Linda is temporarily cancelled due to COVID-19 and social distancing. The only way to meet one of the dogs/puppies we have available for adoption is through completion of our adoption application through our website, poochmatch.com, before 11 AM on Fridays. On Fridays when we review the applications, we will pick the best fit for each dog or puppy applied for and coordinate mutually agreeable appointment times for the applicants who are approved that week. Private appointments are currently only scheduled on Wednesday, Thursday or Saturday of each week. Masks or bandanas are mandatory; faces must be properly covered.\n\nWith the overwhelming desire of the public to adopt at this time, we have received as many as 30 applications for one dog in just one week. Working with a staff of volunteers, we are only able to reach out on Fridays to the people we have approved to adopt. If you have not heard from us by Friday, we have selected a different applicant. If you have multiple dogs/puppies that you are interested in, please indicate each dog/puppy of interest on the application at that time so we don\u2019t rule you out for another dog/puppy available for adoption.\n\nPlease understand, we have an influx of texts, phone calls and emails that makes it impossible to get to each and every one of you. Not just for adoption interest, but also from veterinarians, people who must relinquish dogs, people who have found a stray dog in need of pick up, etc. We are currently not in need of fosters. Due to the fact that there is such a high demand, we are sticking with strict protocol to not adopt out of Southern California. We apologize for this inconvenience and difficulty to be able to get in touch with us while there is an overwhelming desire and demand to adopt at this time. We appreciate your understanding and patience as we navigate through these difficult times with every intention to keep the public and our staff safe.",

He has lots of energy and loves to play hide and seek, but he's also down to chill nearby and take a snooze.\n\nWatch his video to see Churchill in action when he gets the zoomies!\n\nChurchill loves to be near his person, and will follow them everywhere. He also thoroughly enjoys car rides. He's great on a leash, and rarely ever pulls. He also absolutely loves kids! He understands how big he is and is always very gentle and calm with kiddos. He's not a big fan of other dogs, so he'd do best in an only dog home.\n\nFill out an application and come meet Churchill!\n\nPlease go to our website and complete an adoption application at:\n\n/https://www.gsroc.org/application/\n\nAn adoption counselor will contact you to go over your application and assist you in determining which dog may be best for your particular situation.",

She\u2019s a little bit nervous with new people but quickly warms up. She is a very sweet & loving little girl but she can be nippy when startled or when you do something she doesn\u2019t like. Also Paris does have dominant tendencies with people and with other dogs, she will herd them, Because of these behaviors we will not place her in a family with young children.

            "description": "Hi there, my name is Walter! But sometimes I get called 'Sweet Boy' or 'Big Block Head'. I'm a youngin with a lot of pent up energy. You see, I was heart worm positive and I've just been cleared! But that means I've been with my foster mom the last 2 months, going through treatment and I haven't really been able to release my energy. There's some things you should know about me if you're thinking you want to become my FURever home. \n Firstly, I'm crate and house trained. For a while when I first came to live with my foster mom, she would put me in the crate when she went to work, until we got used to each other. Shortly after that, she began to gate the living room and would let me stay on my FAVORITE couch while she was at work. She would leave my bones and toys to chew if I got bored. (It's recommended to put your shoes up and away so I can't get them because there has been a few times I got curious. And any garbage cans should have lids on them or doors should be closed so I can't put any tissues or anything out of them). I can be alone for long hours in case you have to work late but 10 hours is probably my cut off. When we go on walks, mom puts me in a harness because I'm so strong. I walk pretty well on the leash but BOY OH BOY, if I see a squirrel or a cat, I can move fast so mom recommends you give me your full attention on walks so that if I try to chase anything, you can tell me no quickly. \n As far as eating, I'm a growing pup so I get 2 cups in the AM and 2 in the PM. I only like to eat when my human is home so even if you left me in my room with my food, I won't eat it. I also try to drink all my water at once so it's suggested not to fill my bowl all the way. I only know 2 commands right now: sit, and paw. But I'm willing to learn if you teach me! \n I don't bark often, but I can bark at noises outside the home and men when they first enter the home. I'm nervous about men so give me a little time to warm up to them and smell them. I can also be pretty skittish at loud noises too. It may take me time to feel safe so please work with me. I haven't quite mastered the going out thing yet, but my foster mom is trying to get me warmed up to places like breweries and parks so that way if you're social, I can go with you! \n And last but not least, I am QUITE cuddly once I create a bond with you but don't be discouraged if that takes a few days or weeks. Once I feel safe I'm never going to leave your side. I like other dogs and I would do best if I could have a yard to run around in. \n\nContact daviecountyhumane@gmail.com or fill out an application at https://www.davienchumane.org/adopt!\nPlease visit our website, www.davienchumane.org/adopt to complete an adoption questionnaire, or email daviecountyhumane@gmail.com with any questions.",

She's a very intelligent dog who will do well with some training. A visible fenced yard is required.\nHomes with cats or other dogs would not be a good fit. She should only be around children 12 and up. Meet and greets should be slow, as she's a little nervous around new friends.Due to COVID, please fill out an application at homefurever.com. Approved applicants will be notified within two weeks and asked some further questions before meet and greets.

Dant\u00e9 came to us from the Humane Society of Raleigh County, West Virginia.  He had been in the shelter for 4 years and they were having trouble finding him a home.  Poor Dant\u00e9 has sores on his leg, elbow and foot from laying on concrete so much.  He is wonderful on a leash and loves rawhides.  He would be fine with older children--no toddlers, and he loves women and men alike. He has NEVER bitten anyone, but he is a little slow getting to know you.  He just needs a bit of time.  Dant\u00e9's adoption fee is $150.  PLEASE CHOOSE DANTE TO BE YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND!",

Hawaii was nearly naked and bald with her skin warm to the touch and irritated. After many months of medicall baths and good nutrition, Hawaii is looking better than ever. She is a cute, petite little girl who gets along with all humans and other dogs. We have not cat tested her yet. Hawaii is spayed, microchipped, up to date on vaccines and heartworm negative. She is ready to find her forever home.\n\n**If interested,  please head to our website and fill out an application (www.eunoiarescue.org).",

            "description": "The shelter can be a pretty stressful place for any dog but it is especially stressful when being surrounded by dogs makes you anxious. And that's what is going on with Frasier. He is a total love with people, but when he sees other dogs, he becomes overwhelmed. He desperately needs out of the shelter. We have seen this behavior in dogs before, and we know that when we get these pups out of the shelter and in a quiet home environment, they completely thrive. When volunteers take Frasier to one of the shelter's tiny houses, and it is just him and his person, that's when we see the real Frasier. The one who leans into you for pets, who gazes at you with adoration, who wags his tail softly in appreciation of your attention. At 11 years old, the shelter is no place for Frasier. He is clearly confused to be here, and we don't blame him. What does Frasier's ideal home look like? He needs a home with a fenced yard to call his own. Frasier needs to be the only pet but would love to be doted on by a family - adults only or a family with teenagers. We have no doubt he will seamlessly become a part of your family and you'll wonder what took you so long to bring him home. Frasier has so many strikes against him: He's black. He's a senior. He's a pittie mix. He has some lumps and bumps. He needs to be the only pet. We need someone who will look past all of that and accept Frasier for who he is, which is a loyal and loving dog who deserves a chance. I weigh approximately 81 lbs.

            "description": "**This dog is medium sized around 50 lbs\nThank you for considering adoption of a Milo Foundation Sanctuary dog. Our Sanctuary is where our rescued dogs who have had difficulty in a home in the past, have behavioral issues, or too much energy, or for some, aggression issues with other dogs, or intense stranger danger that make them more difficult to safely and happily live in urban environments. These are not beginner dogs or for the most part nor are they for families with children. IF you are looking for an easy dog to add to your family, we suggest looking at the dogs at our Adoption Center, Milo Pt Richmond. BUT, if you can offer a safe and nurturing home to a dog with some behavioral \"quirks\" please do send an application today. Thank you.\n************************************\n\nExperienced owners only! No children. Ideal home has a yard in a less urban area\n\nFoster notes 7/2/20\n\"Our family had the pleasure of fostering Crunchy for 10 weeks in the semi-urban environment of Alameda (East Bay). He coped fairly well with the stress of cars, street noise, etc., but we think he'd do best in a more peaceful/rural environment where he can also have more freedom. While he doesn't seem bothered by most loud noises, the exception is fireworks, which scare the heck out of him. (They became a nightly challenge for him during the noisy lead up to July 4th here in the East Bay.)\n\nEverybody who meets him says Crunchy is such a \"cool dog.\" We speculate that he's mostly black lab, along with a \"mystery mix - educated guesses are Formosa Mountain Dog, Pibble and/or German Shorthaired Pointer. \n\nHe is sensitive, loving and lovable in so many ways - healthy, agile, smart and super sweet to those he loves and trusts. He's a \"people dog and we got very attached to him, very fast! He's fairly mellow and affectionate most of the time, but he really benefits from some freedom and activity. He seems happiest when he can have a good run once or twice a day, or even better, a hike! (He LOVES being out in nature.) \n\nHe was already well-trained when we got him and he enjoyed receiving more training and consistency from us. He's quite a gentleman on walks, especially when using a Gentle Leader. He stops and sits at busy corners, awaiting permission to cross, and he's able to walk with a loose leash most of the time. The only exceptions: he gets reactive with certain other dogs (mostly large ones), and can be very reactive to cats and mailmen. \n\nWhenever we had the chance to let him off leash, he had a blast chasing squirrels and balls. Sometimes, he was mischievously defiant (not listening when called), especially when he'd been cooped up and didn't want to go back on the leash. (He'd make a game of fetch into a game of keep-away.) This is probably trainable with more time.\n\nHe also loves to play tug-of-war and chew - maybe how he earned the name \"Crunchy. We got in the habit of giving him a chew treat every night, which seemed to help him relax. (He never chews or rips apart anything but his own toys and treats, and is very well-behaved in the house.) \n\nThe only serious challenge we experienced is that Crunchy can get jealous and possessive - of his people, his territory and his toys/bones. This became an issue with our 25-year-old son, whom Crunchy seemed to see as competition. We kept them separated to prevent a mishap. For this reason, he'd do best in a home with a single person or a couple and no kids (even adult kids) or other dogs. \n\nIn the right situation, Crunchy will be a GREAT companion dog and protector. We really want him to find \"his person\" (or people), because he's an amazing animal and deserves to be in a happy home! \"\n\nCrunchy is now at the Milo Sanctuary having been returned from his adopters who took him home as a puppy. He is housed with other dogs and does great! He is a gentleman and a sweetheart of a dog. He knows lots of tricks, heels on walks, and loves to cuddle. \nCrunchy likes cuddling, practicing his tricks, and long walks to the park. He has a heart of gold, generally very well behaved and so lovable! Crunchy just had a full checkup and found to be in excellent health! He is house-trained as well. \nHe needs experienced dog adopters - only - who can work with him on his training. He needs training to work through his fear issues. He needs to be in a home that does not have children. He is making progress with reactions to cats, mailmen, and large dogs. But he does not do well in large groups of people and he has some mild separation anxiety. \nCrunchy needs to go to a home in a mellow, low-key area with experienced dog owners and no children due to his fear. \nSince arriving to the Milo Foundation Sanctuary, he has come to enjoy lots of socializing with other dogs. He is sweet with the staff as he gets more and more comfortable with them. If you think you are ready for some Crunchy in your life, contact Milo!",

Our phone number is 618-665-3005. The shelter is open to the public 1-3 Monday-Saturday. Sundays we are open 1-4 to the public. If those times don't work, please call to set up a time to visit.\n\nThe typical adoption fee for dogs is $150. It includes vaccination, deworming , spay/neuter, heartworm testing on dogs of age and microchipping, which is now mandatory by state law. Some dogs we discount to as little as $50 due to sponsorship. Some dogs we ask a higher adoption fee, which helps us recoup expenses on heartworm treatment on other dogs.\n\nAll cats are spayed/neutered/vaccinated/flea treated/dewormed and microchipped prior to adoption. Cat adoption fees range from $60-$100. We spay/neuter/microchip/vaccinate and deworm all kittens and cats, prior to adoption. Our shyer/less adoptable cats are classed as \"barn cats\" and are free with a completed/approved barn cat application, which can be found on our website.\n\nFor updates on adoption events and more pics of pets available, go to our website, www.claycountyshelter.com or look for us on Facebook.",

Her puppies have all been adopted and now it's Hailey's time to start the next chapter of her life. Hailey is about 3 years old.  She weighs about 40 pounds and appears to have a little Pit Bull Mix in her.  She loves puppies, but is picky about which adult dogs she chooses as her friends.  She would probably do best in a home where she is the only pet.  She has not been cat tested.  She loves people, adores children, and her hobby is playing fetch.  She is crate trained and house broken.  \n\nHailey's adoption fee of $200.00 includes her spay, 3 DHPP vaccines, deworming(s), rabies vaccine, and a heartworm test (which was negative).  She is on monthly heartworm prevention, as well as flea prevention.  \n\nFor adoption information, please call FOR PAWS RESCUE at 678-592-0064.",

This girl loves people and demands almost nothing in return. Her previous owner passed away and Nikki needs someone to love her as much as she will love you.\n\nNikki is the ultimate companion and wants to be with people all of the time.\u00a0 She is happy going for a walk and also laying on the couch. She does get sad when her people leave home, and has separation anxiety.  She has been at a positive reinforcement board and train, working closely with a trainer so she can understand that a large, comfy crate can be a safe place when her humans aren\u2019t home.  She is making progress, but is still not a fan of the crate. Additional training will be provided at no cost to help Nikki make a happy transition to her new home.  She knows her basic commands and walks well on a Gentle Leader head collar. \n\nNikki will benefit from daily walks, but is not particularly high energy.\u00a0 She likes to hang out with her people and sometimes play with plushie toys. She will do best with someone who is home a lot that wants a constant companion. Nikki should be an only pet, no other dogs or cats.  She has shown aggression toward small dogs in the recent past, so a home with no furry temptations is a must.  \n\nNikki has been at a positive reinforcement board and train facility for many months, and is ready to find a foster home.  If you are interested in providing Nikki a soft place to land, please complete our foster application which can be found on our website:  www.roversretreat.org",

He is a super goofy and snuggly boy looking for the right person who will help him navigate some of the more uncertain things in life, especially meeting strangers. In his foster home he gets along great with dogs and cats and loves to play with toys (squeaky toys being a favorite!). Apollo makes a great hiking and jogging companion and has an excellent grasp of commands and a willingness to please (esp. if snacks are involved). He is crate trained for longer periods of time out of the house but otherwise Apollo is most content snuggled next to you on the couch.\nHe is trained and comfortable with a basket muzzle for vet visits, etc..\nStaff and Apollo's foster mom would be happy to discuss Apollo's needs further with interested adopters. Apollo is part of our Sit, Stay, Adopt! program so that he can be matched with an appropriate home.",

He is a typical Pyr in that he will alert you if so much as a leaf drops in the neighbor\u2019s yard! Who knows, one day you may thank him for the protection from the killer leaf :) Bailey loves a good play in the yard followed by lots of good pets from his humans. You\u2019ll know you hit just the right spot when he is sitting up and starts to slowly \u2018melt\u2019 onto the ground. Bailey went through a lot in his first few years of life and as a result, he shows resource guarding behavior around his food and high value treats. Bailey loves his walks but still has a lot of work to do on his leash skills and confidence building when seeing other dogs. He is looking for a family that has experience with the breed as well as the time to dedicate to correcting some of these learned behaviors as a result of his rough start in life. Bailey would prefer a quiet home with no children. He is currently living with a small, female dog in his foster home and enjoys playing with her - in the beginning he did need a long, slow introduction period. Bailey is a handsome and smart dog with a gentle heart. He\u2019s looking for a family that will truly understand him and help work through some of his fears. His foster mom says that with lots of love and consistency, Bailey has the potential to become a \u2018model Pyr.\u2019 If you\u2019re the family that can give this boy a second chance at furever, apply today!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nView full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can call 877-739-3582 or email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed. \n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in me!  I want to make sure that it is clear, I am feral.  I was caught in a live trap.  I have only been in rescue for a little over 6 weeks and have a long way to go.  I still can not go outside but I\u2019m amazing with pee pads.  \n\n\nI have only let my foster parents pet me and still it is on my terms most of the time.  My foster mom is unable to get a collar on me because two hands near my face still scares me and I back away when I\u2019m uncomfortable.  I retreat to my kennel when I\u2019m unsure of the situation.  My kennel is my safe zone.  I am kenneled while my foster parents are gone at work and do great for up to 4-6 hours.  \n\n\nI have made progress but I have a long way to go.  I know my name.  I do not know commands, obedience, and I\u2019m learning English.  I have not been around children.  I try to play with the cats but they just run from me.  I love treats!  I love chew toys!  I love the occasional shoe.  I\u2019m beginning to want my belly rubs but it\u2019s only when I\u2019m higher up then my foster mom.  I am still learning to trust her when she introduces new things to me.  \n\n\nIt takes me a day to warm up to a dog but once I do, I\u2019m inseparable and follow them everywhere.  I would do best with another dog in the home to feel comfort and to keep learning.  I am food motivated! \n\n\nI am very excited to find the prefect forever home however I have needs.  I need a 6 ft fence so I can not jump it.  I would do best with another dog or dogs.  It helps me adjust and feel more comfortable.    I need an experience dog owner who will continue to work with me.  Please only serious inquires only.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy name is Valora! My name's origin is Latin meaning brave, courageous and in Spanish means flower!\n\n \nMy journey hasn\u2019t been easy.  I am feral and I was caught in a live trap.  This, along with new people and environment, has been very stressful - but I am warming up to my foster family and other dog-friends.\n\n \nThe last 3 weeks have been full of new experiences.  At the beginning of the week, I went to the vet to get spayed.  I was not a fan and was very stress due to the new environment, smells, and people.  The veterinarians did a great job!  I was mad at my foster mom and it took a day for me to feel normal again so I hid in my kennel where I felt safe.  The next day, I was back to my routine and hanging with my foster siblings.  My foster mom gave me the space and encouragement I needed to trust her again.  \n\n I have a routine down and I love bed time!  I dart into the room to claim my spot on the dog bed.  I share the dog bed with my foster siblings because I feel safe snuggled up to them.  Occasionally, in the middle of the night, I get on the human bed and lick my foster\u2019s mom face. \n\nI bolt out of the room in the morning with my foster siblings.  They go outside and I go to the pee pad to go to the bathroom.  My foster mom thinks I will be outside soon but I need a collar on first.  I get so excited for food time that my tail doesn\u2019t stop wagging!\n\n \nAnother JHAR dog, named Dixie, came to stay with us and I was unsure about her for the first day.  After some time and watching her from my safe place, my kennel, I got more comfortable with her movements and decided to meet her.  By the end of her visit we were inseparable.  We played and chewed on toys together.  \n\n \nWith everything my foster mom has done in the last three weeks and  giving me time and space to adjust,  I have gained her trust.  I was unsure at first but allowed her to give me scratches.  It\u2019s been two days and I think I\u2019m in love with scratches!!!  I have only let her scratch me standing.  I\u2019m getting there and hopefully soon I will be ready for my forever home.  I can\u2019t wait to get a lifetime of belly rubs!  \n\nI am adoptable to the right environment.  I need someone who can keep building my trust and confidence up.  Someone who has time and patience to continue working with me and teaching me the house life.  I am eager to learn!  A fenced in yard is a requirement.  \n\n\nAge: Estimated DOB 10/22/19.\nGender: Female, spayed\nBreed(s): Husky mix\nWeight: \nDog friendly: yes\nCat friendly: yes\nAdoption fee: $250 plus tax\n\nFor more information on our pets and to read about the adoption process, visit our website. https://www.journeyhomeanimalrescue.org/adopt",

            "description": "\u201cBE SURE TO WATCH MY VIDEO!\u201d\n\nDate of birth: 5/2018\n\n12/17/2020: Esteban is an absolute sweetheart! We think he\u2019s possibly a Beagle/Lab mix and he\u2019s 2 years old. He\u2019s a cutie with those floppy ears and goofy smile! He\u2019s extremely affectionate and he loves belly rubs!\n\n\u2022 Esteban is very friendly and sweet natured. He likes soft toys that squeak. He also loves to play fetch and run around the yard with a toy. \n\n\u2022 He\u2019s quiet when kenneled and seems to be house trained. \n\n\u2022 Sadly, Esteban had severe injuries when he was picked up by KCK Animal Services as a stray. We transferred him to our facility for medical care. One back leg was severely broken and had to be amputated. His other back leg required FHO surgery. He's doing incredibly well now, given how bad off he was. \n\n\u2022 WATCH HIS VIDEO to see just how well he is running now!  \n\n\u2022 He is on Duralactin, a long-term joint supplement to help him going forward. It costs about $76 for a bottle of 90 chews. One of our veterinarians is also doing acupuncture once a week on Esteban to help him with muscle soreness as he heals.  \n\n\u2022 His new home or foster home should have minimal stairs for him to have to maneuver within the house or going outdoors, and carpeted stairs would be best.  \n\n\u2022 You could foster Esteban prior to adopting him to see if you're comfortable with his needs and if he's a good fit for you.\n\n\u2022 We haven\u2019t been able to thoroughly test Esteban with other dogs due to his injuries, but he seems to like the other dogs he sees and has casually met. We hope to test him more very soon. Any dog in the home would need to be a fairly laid back dog due to Esteban\u2019s injuries. If you have a dog you could bring your dog to meet Esteban to see if they could be buddies.  \n\n\u2022 Esteban weighs 57 lbs. He has been neutered, vaccinated, microchipped and tested for heartworms. \n\nMORE ON ADOPTING OUR DOGS... \n\n> COVID-19 UPDATE:  PLEASE SUBMIT AN ONLINE ADOPTION APPLICATION AND A MEMBER OF OUR ADOPTIONS TEAM WILL REACH OUT TO YOU.  Please visit our web site at HSGKC.ORG for an adoption application, our current COVID-19 adoption protocol, and other adoption info.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> If you decide you'd like to adopt one of the pets you meet, we reserve the pet for you but we generally don't send the pet home with you that day. We\u2019ll instead schedule a pick up date and time that\u2019s convenient for you.\u00a0  \n\n> Our goal is to send you home with a healthy pet and any information and support you may need to help your new pet adjust to his or her new home.  All of our dogs & puppies have been spayed or neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, treated for fleas & ticks, tested for heartworms (7 mo. and over), and are on monthly heartworm preventative. Puppies who are too young to receive all the necessary puppy boosters and/or first rabies shot may be brought back to us for those vaccines at no extra charge. You will also receive a leash, collar, coupons for pet supplies and services, toys, and educational materials. And we'll give your dog a bath before he or she goes home! \n\n> Please note that we prefer and may require a fenced yard for many of our dogs.  Exceptions are made on an individual basis depending on the dog's needs, the person's dog experience, the dog's and person's activity levels, home environment and other factors. \n\nThank you for searching for a shelter pet!\n\nDog Adoption Contact Info:\nEmail: christine@hsgkc.org\nPhone: 913.521.2339\nhttp://hsgkc.org",

She has been around several dogs, but we have found she would be best as an only dog as she is jealous of the attention. She loves all people, children and adults. She would be best in a fenced yard but of course as a house dog as one of the humans in the family!  \n\nFully vetted including spay, chip, all vaccines. Riley\u2019s adoption fee is sponsored for $100 so her fee has been lowered from $350 to $250. \n\nIf you are interested, apply at www.lifehouse.petfinder.com.

We know at some point she had a human, but no one came for her. Babs is a big time cuddle bug and she's all about humans. She loves roaming the yard with her person and has excellent recall. Babs is very skilled at catching treats in the air. She would do best as an only dog in the home. If you are looking for your next best friend, we promise that this gal will be just that. Please see the pit bull requirements below and if you fit the criteria, send in your application today!\n\nPit bull & strong breed adoption criteria\n- Must be over 25 years of age to adopt a Pit Bull, Pit Bull mix, or strong breed dog.\n- Written landlord permission or a pet policy allowing the specific breed is required for adoption approval.\n- A virtual home visit may be required. \n- Training or breed experience is required as part of the adoption.\n- Agree to not take the dog to dog parks or dog daycare. \n- Pit Bull only: our values very closely aligned with Villalobos Rescue Center.

Unfortunately our vet discovered that Angus needs TPLO surgery on his left leg along with having hip dysplasia. We are working on getting him fixed up with our friends at Wasson Memorial Vet Clinic but that means at this time he is not available for adoption. We are always looking for support so we can help dogs like Angus. Please consider making a donation to help cover the cost of Angus surgery. Thank you for helping us save lives!\n\nHave you met our buddy Angus? No?!?! Let me introduce you! Angus checks all the boxes. He is a smart, handsome, and agile young boy. He's looking for someone who loves to play (especially ball!), and who will help him make the right choices when he gets spooked by a world that hasn't always felt safe to him. What you will get in return is a loyal friend who will make you laugh and who will warm your heart with affection. Angus is one of our longest resident and we want nothing more then to see our boy in a forever home. Since coming to us in May, Angus has not had the chance to go off to foster. He is ready to ditch kennel life and we dont blame him. Can you foster Angus? Even better! Can you provide a wonderful forever home for our buddy? \n\nFoster Inquiry\nDogfosterteam@hsimc.org\n\nAdoption inquiry\nDogteam@hsimc.org\n\n707 485 0123\n\nAdoption app\nMendohumanesociety.com",

He will have to be on 3 different medications for the rest of his days. He so deserves to be in a home where he can be taken care of.....probably for the first time in his life . A quiet home with a fenced yard and a doggie door. He is on a diuretic so the doggie door would be a plus for him. Zeke is a friendly,loving boy that needs some love in his life.\n\nIdeally a local foster so he can continue with our established veterinarian.",

Just copy and paste the link below into your browser (or simply type it in) and then search for the dog's \"gallery\" by name\n\n          http://adoptasleddog.smugmug.com\n\nVIDEOS:  In addition to photo albums, almost every dog has a video which will give you a much better \"feel\" for his or her personality.  NOTE:  In the new Petfinder format, it has become quite a bit more difficult to find and to play videos.  Please PAGE THROUGH the photos, looking for a photo overlaid in the center with a \"play\" arrow inside a circle.  This icon is white, so it can be difficult to see. \n In many (most) cases, the video is the last photo displayed as you page through.  Just click on that photo and it will play.  Please make sure you CHECK ON THE PETFINDER VIDEO ICON, above, to see a video of this wonderful dog!  Our videos will include, at a minimum, whatever info we had on the dog upon (or shortly after) his/her arrival into our program.  There will sometimes be video updates as well.  And in every case, our Adoptions Coordinator can be emailed at ADOPTASLEDDOG@AOL.COM to answer questions and provide the most current information we have on the dog.  \n\nNOTES:  Please see video or contact our Adoptions Coordinator at ADOPTASLEDDOG@AOL.COM.\n\nADOPTION DONATION:  $250  Before adoption, all Northern Lights dogs (regardless of whether Petfinder's symbols appear) are spayed or neutered, microchipped, heartworm negative, fully vaccinated and tested/treated for known parasites.\n \nWHAT TO DO IF YOU WANT TO ADOPT THIS DOG:  Email us at ADOPTASLEDDOG@AOL.COM to request an application and get started.  WE DO NOT HAVE AN ONLINE APPLICATION - you will have to request one via email.  We will review your application to determine if there is a good fit between you and/or your family and this dog.  We may suggest another dog or dog(s) if we can offer a better fit in terms of lifestyle, experience, other pets, etc.  A vet check, reference checks, and a home visit will be conducted before an adoption can be considered for approval.  \n \nNORTHERN LIGHTS DOES NOT HAVE A PHYSICAL SHELTER.  We are a nonprofit rescue organization comprised of individuals who open their private homes to foster dogs in need of a second chance..  When fosters are not available, we often pay to board a dog until space is available.  New fosters and donations to pay for boarding are always desperately needed us.  Email us at KATYLIED2@AOL.COM if you are interested in donating or for information on fostering.\n \nFAQ:  For information regarding our organization, as well as adoption policies and practices, please visit our Petfinder Home Page at WWW.NORTHERNLIGHTS.PETFINDER.COM.\n \n \nNOTICE:  In the vast majority of cases, the dogs in our program and rescued from shelters, and Northern Lights has no means by which to collect or verify a dog's history.  We work in concert with our veterinarians, and breed and age estimates are based on a combination of professional input and our collective experience.  Our policy with information acquired prior to acceptance and while the dogs are in our care is that of \"full disclosure\".  It is our goal to ensure the adopter has all available information to ensure the best possible match between the dog and the adopter(s).  If we have identified a behavioral or health condition while the dog is in our care and custody, every effort will be made to correct it prior to adoption, OR the adopter will be made aware of the issue or condition prior to adoption.  Northern Lights' screening process is designed to identify only those adopters who are willing, and have the means, to treat conditions which may occur after adoption, and the adopter will be contractually responsible for doing so. However, Northern Lights' policy is to accept any adopted dog back into the program, at any time, for any reason.\n",

            "description": "We think little Maggie, the sweet 10 year old shih tzu mix will be the perfect quarantine companion for some lucky person. On her best days, she is a happy, easy dog to share your home with. On her bad days, her hips give her trouble trying to get out of bed. Maggie is friendly with everyone she meets and looks extra adorable after a trip to the groomers. Maggie weighs about 10 pounds and her favorite thing to do is mosey slowly around the neighborhood, sniffing as she goes. Car rides are no big deal for her. Maggie naps a lot and likes to be next to you on the couch or in one of her comfy dog beds. She will use a dog door to potty outside. On occasion there is an accident just inside the closed door when her foster dad doesn't hear her bark to go out late at night. Maggie likes to wander if garden gates are left open, so it will be important that she have someone to keep an eye on her and she will be sure to return the favor. We have spent the past 5 months trying to troubleshoot the various medical challenges that she arrived with so that Maggie can be placed in a loving forever home for the rest of her days. She has had a visit to the vet to clean her pearly whites. Her arthritis pain is under control with one pill a day (gabapentin). Maggie requires daily medication that reduces the frequency of her mild seizures. We are positive that this delightful little dog will make some lucky person very happy, and we acknowledge that not everyone is going to be up for the level of care that she will require on a daily basis. Maggie mostly ignores and easily coexists with the other dogs that she has been introduced to. She has been friendly when meeting kids or visiting with friends, though we believe Maggie would be happier in a calmer home without loud, young kids because her eyesight isn't the best at this stage in her life and their shenanigans may be too much at times if they arent old enough to be respectful of her space. Maggie is a good little dog who would be happy to keep someone company and enjoy a nice, relaxing life.",

He is a work in progress and someone who is wise to the ways of a Houdini dog would be perfect for him. \n\nHe needs a secure fence, he can climb like Spiderman! He is a door darter and an escape artist extraordinaire. MURPHY PREFERS MEN and MUST be in a MAN ONLY home. He's mostly fine with other dogs, but may be best as an only dog. He would not do well around children and we're not sure about cats.\n\nHis adoption fee is $250, and that includes all vaccinations, microchip, heartworm negative and on preventative. He is located in the St. Louis area. If you are interested in meeting Murphy, please complete an application today: http://www.mominpinrescue.org/p/adoption-application_30.html",

Could potentially match with a veru balanced, co-existing dog and a family that knows how to set boundaries right away.\n\nCats - He is OK with cats but would need to monitored and introduced with slow introductions. No aggression, just interested.\n\nKids - OK out & about but needs to child-free home.\n\nBackground - Stray from Compton. Picked up by the police and brought to the shelter.\n\nCrate trained - Hates the crate. Would do best in a home with someone who works from home and a room where he can be left in a smaller area when you are away (only a couple hours a day).\n\nLeash trained - Does fine on leash\n\nHousebroken - Uses the doggy door, will also go to the back door and wait.\n\nEating Habits - Great eater\n\nCommands known - Sit\n\nCar rides - Fine in the car. Doesn't like to get in and out but when in no issues.\n\nBath time - Does fine.\n\nAffectionate - Super affectionate. Loves every kind of touch. Wants to be right next to you at all times.\n\nActivity level - Low, couch potatoes. Loves to go on walks but can't go far. Must be in a home without stairs as he does have hip dysplasia and 2 bad knees. Does great on Carprofen and he does run around the yard and seems to be pain free.\n\nPlay style - No real play style, more of a lounger.\n\nMedical - He has hip dysplasia and 2 bad knees. He does not use a brace currently but it has been suggested that it could help him. These issues don't stop him from doing everything he wants to do though, but do limit his ability to be too active out & about.\n\nBad habits - Snoring definitely! He CANNOT HAVE squeaky toys or squeaky balls as he will guard them.\n\nRedeeming qualities - Happy to see you always, gives you a happy dance when it's time to eat. He uses a slow feeder bowl. Doesn't let his knee and hip problems bring him down. Still trys to be the best dog he can.\n\nBest feature - His calm loving demeanor. You can just see it in his eyes how much he loves you and how he wants to be the bestest boy!\n\nWhat Foster Mom/Dad wants you to know -\n\nHe definitely needs someone that will be strict with him and lets him know he doesn't need to keep them safe but you will keep him safe. He doesn't let his hips and knees keep him from doing dog stuff but low activity is a must. He is a very smart boy and just wants to be loved all the time. Loves to give kisses. Will be right there with you for any sun tanning sessions. Enjoys getting in a kiddy pool and cooling down with you. Is fantastic with every person he meets.\n\nPlease consider sponsoring Beefcake with either a one-time or monthly tax-deductible donation.

I am an aristocratic, particular gentleman so I value my personal space and am not a big couch cuddler. I do so love the comforts of home, though, so if you are an experienced owner with understanding, patience, a fireplace, and a recliner or dog bed I could call my own, I may be the one you are looking for!",

He is a gregarious guy--likes people of all ages, dogs and ignored the cats at the shelter !\nHis age is unknown as he was originally adopted as a stray ......his teeth look great and he has quite a bounce to his step so we estimate his age as around 8 but he could be older .\nHoudini will make a great companion for nice walks and afternoon siestas :-) and BELLY RUBS!\nHis foster says he is a sweet boy and we will post more pictures as he settles in. He rode perfectly in the car, too!\n\nIf you are not yet approved to adopt from All Shepherd Rescue, please fill out our online application at www.allshepherdrescue.com. Our adoption fee is $350.00.",

See our adoption proccess.\nRANDY is a big healthy senior mal looking for his perfect family! Do not let his age fool you--he has the energy of a 2-year-old! This guy is strong, super smart and will do best in an adult only home. Randy loves attention and really adores people. He has great house manners and will not destroy nor chew items, is house trained and knows his commands in both English and German. His best day includes lots of walking, hiking and activity. He rides great in the car, jumps in and out with ease and loves to have the window cracked to stick his head out. Randy enjoys his\nfood but can be reactive if someone tries to take away food wrappers etc. so he needs a committed owner to\ncontinue the positive progress he is making in his foster home. He can get reactive at the sight of other dogs and\nneeds a careful handler while on leash. His foster says that, after some time with her, Randy has grown comfortable\nenough to show his goofy and playful sides!\n\nCheck out my Instagram from my time in foster @thefluffyfoster\n\nInterested in sponsoring?

            "description": "Hello SCOOBY!Super smart, sweet and affectionate. Scooby is a very young 8-year old German Shepherd Dog mix. He's about 45-50 pounds (medium-size), and if his precious pointy ears don't get you, his playful, clever personality will. Scooby came to us from a shelter in North Carolina. He once had a family, but turned up stray. Some very kind friends of his asked Maxx & Me to give this special darling the chance the shelter couldn't...How could we say no. Scooby's foster says he is a fantastic, laid back companion while she works during the day, a playful pup on his walks in the neighborhood and a well-behaved buddy for car rides. Scooby's a little insecure with other dogs so we would like to place him a home without any (we have lots of faith this will improve-he has a nice general disposition and no real signs of aggression). We haven't had him around children, but he'd probably do well with teens or older. Probably he would like to chase kitties since he's super smart and would regard them as entertaining...If you would like to meet this handsome fellow, please complete our adoption application: www.maxxandme.org/adopt-app<http://www.maxxandme.org/adopt-app>. If you are reading this, he is available, please complete the application and his representative will reach out to you.\nScooby is neutered, up to date on vaccines, and microchipped. Adoption donation is only $250.\nMaxx & Me is an all volunteer, all foster home rescue and do not have a shelter. Please allow at least 48 hours for applications to be processed (missing information may slow the process, so please take your time and be thoughtful in your answers). All dogs posted are available (so no need to ask). We place dogs based on best home for each dog and not order of applications received. Email us at maxxandmerescue@gmail.com for updates and questions. Thank you for choosing rescue.",

He is just a big lovable baby but he is dog aggressive so he has to be the only pet.  He was probably abused too because he is so timid and cowers for any quick movement.   He has the most adorable almond-shaped brown eyes, a soft coat and adorable ears.  He is friendly and lovable to people. His adoption donation is $250 which includes his neuter, vaccinations, microchip.  He is heartworm negative and on monthly preventative.  He absolutely has to be the only pet and no children.  He has a lot of potential in the right home so please come to meet him.\nhttp://www.aforeverhomeanimalrescue.org/Project/cheez/ \nWe are only able to adopt within the state of Florida.  \nWe have a page on our website that explains our adoption process, and contains a link to our adoption application.

See our adoption proccess.\nNOOKA is a very fun and sweet girl who needs daily exercise to help her release all her malamute energy. For this spry 8-year-old gal exercise is very crucial! She loves walking/hiking with a backpack as it gives her the little extra exercise she needs while on walks and helps her focus. It takes her time to warm up to new people and Nooka seems to favor females. She's not much of a snuggler, is independent and can be left alone at home for hours without causing any damage. She also loves her crate and sleeps in there all night with no problem. Nooka would do best being the only dog in the house and in an adult only home. As most malamutes do, she has a very high prey drive so no kitties or small furries. Nooka is great at telling you when she needs to go out to the bathroom. Her voice is really beautiful, and she is not afraid to use it. She loves to sing and be heard. Overall, she is a great girl who would be best in a house with people who are highly active and would get her plenty of exercise.\nApproved adopters are encouraged to communicate directly with the foster to learn more. Interested in sponsoring? See our sponsorship information.\n2/1/21 10:49 PM",

This fit active boy loves going places and being out in public--outdoor restaurants, walks, hikes-and adores his car rides! Kanga, once he knows you, loves giving licks and kisses and is super affectionateyou just need to let him initiate in the early days while he is building trust. This pup has had a challenging past and he just needs to know you can be count on to pay attention to his physical cues when he's feeling overwhelmed or unsure. Kanga has no issue being left alone for 3-4 hours and is happy to sleep in your bed or anywhere as long as he can be close to you. Kanga won't do well in an apartment setting with cramped stairways or elevators, so we are looking for a home setting for him with a secure yard. As far as other dogs, Kanga can be choosy so we are looking for a home where he can be Fuzzball King of the Castle! Definitely NO cats and young kids are iffy too. Dog savvy teens may be ok as long as they are aware of Kanga's \"dog language\" and can give him space when he needs it.\nThis boy just wants to love and trust somebody so badly!!\n\nFor now, we are being cautious about having Kanga in a home with other dogs. He has exhibited some guarding issues in his foster home with the resident dog so we are saying no other dogs in the home. Same for no cats and no young children. Our goal is to find the best home for Kanga and one where his chances for a successful adoption are high! To \"sweeten the pot\" John has agreed to provide ongoing dog training (first lesson free)!\n\nCheck out Kanga's Instagram from his time in foster @kanga_the_malamute\n\nInterested in sponsoring?

Our veterinary partner estimates that Tokyo is 8 months old at the time of intake in June 2020. Tokyo is good with people of all ages and other dogs. Tokyo came to us in rough condition and suffering from a skin infection. But he has received the medical care he requires, and he is ready to set out on the path to his happy forever! Tokyo loves to be next to his humans and one of his favorite past times is cuddling. He is very sweet but is still a bit fearful of the humans in his life. He needs a patient, quiet home with very low traffic in and out or separate space that Tokyo can call his own. Tokyo will need a confident, friendly dog in his forever home who will play/interact with Tokyo. He is house trained and loves his long walks but is also content being on the couch and being snuggled. If there are children in Tokyo's forever home, they should be older children who can respect Tokyo's needs during his transition period. Tokyo loves other dogs, and is thriving with the basic training he is receiving. Tokyo listens well and wants to learn. If you have room in your heart for this special boy, please apply online to adopt Tokyo at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

            "description": "Bullet had a rough life before coming the Haven. He was chained outside for the majority of his life and only saw people when they were bringing him food and water. He came to us with his nails so long and curled back into paws. Despite the lack of love he received, Bullet is a super loving boy!! He does a dance when he sees you coming to his pen. He loves his ears scratched and is a sucker for treats (hotdogs are his favorite). We've estimated Bullet's date of birth to be 06/06.2013. We've noticed that his hearing and eyesight is not the best, but this doesn't seem to bother him. Because of his special needs, he has found reading other dogs social cues a little difficult. Because of this he will need to go to a home with other friendly and patient dogs. \nWeight: 74lbs DOB 6-6-2013...All pets have lifetime sanctuary at Haven of the Ozarks. If they cannot remain with their adopter, they must be returned to the Haven.\n\nAdoption fees are as follows: \nPuppies under the age of 6 months - $125\nDogs weighing 30 pounds and less - $125 \nDogs ages 6 months to 5 yrs old - $90\nDogs over the age of 5 yrs old - $75.\nCats under the age of 6 months old - $75\nCats over the age of 6 months old - $65",

I have a sad past in that someone shot me twice and abandoned me on the streets.  Still, my love and utter resiliency wins every time and I continue to trust humans again and again. I can get a little protective of my food but can you blame me?  When you live on the streets, fighting for a daily meal it makes one kind of protective.  I just need someone to take a chance on me and show me some love.  I need to understand that I am safe from now on and that I will never have to argue about my next meal.  As long as you have some cash in that wallet to buy me plenty of kibble we will be best friends. I would also dig a comfy bed and some new plushy toys.  I am house trained, crate trained and walk well on a leash.  If you are deserving of my unconditional love please submit an application.  I will be forever grateful.  \n\nI am current on vaccines, microchipped and neutered.",

I'm only about 65lbs. but have the biggest heart! I am currently working on my separation anxiety and also learning that I don't need to be in protective mode ALL the time. And once I'm comfortable with you I love me some belly rubs. I use to live most of my life outside and had to share, so now I'm learning to not be so possessive with my bed and food bowl when my cat roommate's come around. I'm not aggressive, just don't want to share I guess. I also have allergies and most of my fur on my stomach was gone but since my foster family keep me inside and bathe me my skin is looking much better and fur is starting to grow back. My foster family also got me a crate and I LOVE IT! It's my very own space and it's my spot when my humans run errands. I just usually end up taking a nap while they are gone, although I have been known to howl for my humans when I miss them. My foster family also lives on property and we go for walks, they even take me off leash so I can explore. I get to smell and see lots of different plants and animals. I never chase and if my humans tell me no or stay, I'm on it! They have also been working with me to take treats slowly and politely as well as sit before I get to chow down. I'm a star student! I know if I find a family that is patient and loving I will be the best companion as I am very loving and loyal.",

He needs a skilled adopter who has the time to work with him and his needs.  He gets along with other animals and will make a good companion for a person with patience.\n\nOliver is neutered and fully vaccinates and microchipped.  He will be getting a dental soon.\n\nWe are only able to adopt in our local Chicago metro area.  We are volunteers  who work full time.

His paralysis causes him to have bladder stones so his diet restrictions are mandatory.  His has had surgery for bladder stone removal and recent issues with stone recurrence which is now solved.  \n\nHe is an awesome dog but needs a skilled adopter with dogs and one with managing paralysis.  If you have no experience then please do not apply.  He is not a science experiment.\n\nIf you read this far, then you might like to know he is a nice guy that we feel had been harmed in his past and can get snappy.  We have found ways to calm him to allow us to break through his fear aggression. He is really a pretty nice guy but has certain triggers we believe from his past that cause a bit of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde in him.   He gets along with other dogs and seems to be fine with a new kitten we brought in recently.  We hope to get him a cart soon.  He has been vetted and has  his vaccinations,  neuter,  and  microchip.  We will getting him a dental soon,\n\nHe isn't an easy adopt and if you can't adopt him but wish to help by sponsoring  his care we would be grateful!

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website. Here are some helpful tips:\n\u2022\tAll dogs listed on Petfinder are still available. \n\u2022\tPlease DO NOT use the \"Ask About Me\" tab on this page. We DO NOT receive these inquiries.\n\u2022\tWe CANNOT move forward until we receive an application. Even if you're only interested, please fill out an application at mnpitbull.com. We will respond within 24-48 hours (M-F) after receiving your inquiry. \n\u2022 Adoption fees are as follows: 2-5 months old: $400, 6-9 months old: $350, 10+ months old: $250. This covers their Spay/Neuter, Vaccinations, Microchip, 4DX, Fecal Tests, and Housing Costs. ********************************************************************************************************\n\nTegan is 7 years old and we've had the opportunity to care for her for the last three months. We have fallen head over heels. If you don't have other pets, Tegan is the dog for you. She is gentle with people and sweet with kids. We introduced her to our friends' 6-month-old baby, and she licked his toes. She grew up with two kids in her first family, so she's great with older children too. \n\nTegan is a strong dog - we lovingly call her burly babe. She pulls on walks - she likes to go after squirrels, rabbits, and birds, but her prong collar really helps (a perfect example of why Tegan would do best in a home without cats). We keep her on a short leash around other dogs, but she doesn't bark or growl at them. Tegan has some issues with her back legs, so we limit going up and down stairs and give her a boost on the sofa once in a while. We've been giving her a daily hip and joint chew that seems to be helping. \n\nTegan loves to relax and hang out, but she also loves to go on walks and is very playful. Her favorite game is being chased around the house with a toy. Tegan is very smart and well-behaved. She is house trained & kennel trained. She hasn't gotten into stuff, including food, and doesn't bark much. We live in a duplex and when she used to bark and growl at our neighbors when they went to the basement, but all we had to do was yell \"hey\" a few times and she stopped barking at them. \n\nOverall, Tegan would be a great addition to any family. She's sweet, loving, gentle and goofy. \n\nSpecial Note- Tegan is on Proin for a leaky bladder and as long as she has her pill, there is no issue. It is about $50 every 6 months. \n\nIf you would like to meet Tegan one on one, please visit www.mnpitbull.com for our adoption process and online application. \n",

            "description": "Bayard and another beagle sidekick were picked up as strays. Pleasantly plump at around 40#, Bayard was certainly well fed--so we suspect he'd not been on his own for long. After a brief stay as a county pound, his pal got adopted and Bayard upgraded to a room at STAF. His tail has not stopped wagging since, putting him in the running for happiest pup on the planet! (See video for demonstration.) Super friendly and calm, Bayard (est. birthday 2012) loves taking leisurely walks, sniffing everything in sight beagle-style. While he has passed evaluations for doggy daycare, he does get jealous and grumbly when it comes to sharing human attention with another dog. May be happier as an only child. Please check back for more info as we get to know Bayard better. If he makes your beagle-lovin' heart go pitter-patter, email us and let's chat!\n\n\u2022  All of our animals are spayed/neutered and current on shots.\n\u2022  We do not do same-day adoptions; we ask that you return for a follow-up visit before taking an animal home.\n\u2022  You must be 21 years or older to adopt from STAF.\n\u2022  We require a 4-foot-tall physical fence for homes with children under the age of 11. We also may require a physical fence for specific dogs on a case-by-case basis, depending on each dog\u2019s behavior and exercise needs.\n\u2022  Due in part to increasing coyote activity/incidents in the area and the difficulty of predicting how a dog will respond to invisible fence training, we can not adopt to homes with invisible fences.\n\u2022  We do request vet and personal references.\n\u2022  We can facilitate adoptions within a 75-mile radius of our Cincinnati-based shelter.\n\nPlease visit www.STAF.org for visiting hours, a downloadable application, and additional information.\n",

I took the initiative & tried to move in with him. Unfortunately his elderly owner wasn't in the position to take a younger gal like myself in. Her and my foster mom were in cahoots to end my gypsy ways. Turns out, I happen to fancy being a house dog. One that excludes cats too. There's just something about how they skulk around acting like they want to play, but I discovered that they're all frauds. They don't really want to play, they get all high and mighty when I try. Talk about mixed signals! Anyway, I'm 3 years old, spayed, vetted, house trained and crate trained and would very much like to have a family of my very own. My foster friend got adopted, so life is pretty lonely nowadays. I promise to greet you everyday with a smile and aim to please. Especially if there's a bully stick involved, those are my favorite!",

Hes happy to work his way onto your lap for cuddles and kisses, and will flash you his bright smile! Rex is a shy, gentle guy who likes new people to go slow with him. Adults are fine, but kids seem to be a little too scary for this sweetheart. Once he knows that you are a friend, though, he is all wiggles and tail wags! Rex is a fan of treats, being petted and chilling on his comfy blankets! He is currently paired with another dog in his shelter space, and could go home with a dog after a meet and greet. Rex is a dog who has a few specific training needs. What does that mean? Well, in addition to being adorable and fun, it also means that hes exhibited some behaviors in the shelter that require some extra training. Lucky for him, he has a whole crew of staff and volunteers dedicated to working with him to address them. Hooray! As the adopter of a dog with specific training needs (thats Rex!), the Austin Animal Center will provide you with some extra resources just for choosing Rex to be a part of your family. How awesome is that?! This includes a training voucher and post-adoption support from our Behavior Team. The behavior team will be happy to answer any questions you have about your new family member and provide support when needed. Although Rex needs a little time to get to know you, he knows that his love and sweet nature will last a lot longer! I weigh approximately 63 lbs. Click here to view my paperwork.",

She is a calm girl that just wants to lay on her bed, her human\u2019s bed or the couch and chill with her family. She is house and crate trained. Frankie would do better in a home as an only furbaby as others tend to get on her nerves. Frankie does not do well with cats. She is fine around people of all ages. Frankie wants to make sure that her new family knows that she will not go out to potty in the rain, tolerates car rides but prefers to stay home, expects snacks but has to watch her figure, and demands pink collars and sweaters. Frankie would do better in a home with a fenced in yard as she can be leash reactive. She will need a caring and strong human that is willing to love her and be patient with her. After only a few minutes around Frankie, her personality will shine and you will find it difficult to stop smiling",

            "description": "Hi Angel world...I want to thank you for saving me! Even though I am a senior around 10 years old, I have lots of life and love to give! I am a tiny girl at only 10lbs. but my foster mommy said I could add a pound or two.\n\nI am a dachshund mix but have the cutest ears that stand back making me look like the flying nun when I look up at you. I am shy at first and still take some time to warm up, but I really like getting fed on a regular basis and love my new, comfy dog bed. I absolutely LOVE my dog treats and take them with enthusiasm. My foster mommy has me separated from her other doggies right now as I have the sniffles but I am very curious to meet them soon.\n\nI am developing into a sweet companion type dog and love to spend time with my humans. I am heartworm positive right now which means I will need to go through treatment before being ready for my new home. I could be eligible for adoption prior to starting my treatments and Angels will pay for my treatment in your home. I need a quiet environment without a lot of activity to keep my heart rate down. I also have a cherry eye that will need to be treated.\n\nOnce my foster mommy knows a little bit more about me, she will update my profile but wanted you to know I am a very sweet girl and would love to get settled into a new home prior to treatment if possible. Otherwise, once my treatment starts in about 4 weeks, my foster mommy will take care of me until I am ready to go to my new home.\n\nPlease let Angels know if you would like to hear more about me!\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online at http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.\n\n*Some of our animals receive a high volume of applications, and we strive to select the best home for each animal. However, we have many wonderful homeless pets available.",

He's mostly potty trained when let out regularly, but he does occasionally mark in the house. He's good with other dogs but does not do well in the crate. He walks well on a leash and loves to go for walks. He loves to be with his person all the time and loves to cuddle and have his belly rubbed.\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online at http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.\n\n*Some of our animals receive a high volume of applications, and we strive to select the best home for each animal.

This gorgeous, mischievous girl can and will jump a 6 foot fence so she should be on leash at all times when outdoors. Meredith is not only beautiful - she is a wonderfully loving dog that is happy all of the time. If she is feeling particularly joyous she will shine a bright smile at us. Meredith does OK with some other dogs but she would have to meet any potential fuzzy siblings. She loves to play, and offers up lots of hugs and kisses to the humans that are enchanted by her. A home of her own will make her the happiest gal in the world.\n\nVisit Meredith at www.hua.org!",

            "description": "Update on Jester: October 2020 - Jester was recently diagnosed with degenerative lumbar spondylosis. What this means is that he has three to four vertebral joints in his lumbar/lumbosacral spine that are unstable and are causing bridging spondylosis, that can be painful to him, in order to try to stabilize his spine. Unfortunately, theres not too much that can be done other than getting him on some pain management medication to keep him as comfortable as possible. Pain management will be the primary and most effective treatment for him. This condition is not reversable and he will live with it for the rest of his life. \n\nHis vet notes that hes pretty young to already have this affect so many vertebrae as its not typically seen in dogs until theyre around 8-10 years old. His hips and elbows came back nice and normal though. The vet said to keep him on low-impact activities as its in the spine and unstable so advised not to jostle it unnecessarily. Jester's potential home will need to take into account that he will not be able to participate in high impact activities, but being a Mal, he will definitely try. He will need special care and consideration for the duration of his life. \n\nOriginal Post: Jester is an approximately 4 year old male. He was originally an import malinois that was purchased to train for police work. He did not test out well and did not have the drive for scent detection or protection work. He was then crated or locked in a kennel for several years. This means he was not well socialized and has had some issues to overcome. He was then let out only to go to the bathroom. The people who would let him out would grab him by the collar and quickly close him in the crate. As a result he has a lot of negative association with this and is unsure with strangers who grab his collar. \n\nHe has made a lot of improvements in his current foster home. He was not house trained but has since been learning house manners. He is not trustworthy to be left alone at home so he will need to be crated and Jester is crate trained. \n\nOver all Jester is a sweet boy who bonds well. He will test his handler so he needs a more experienced working dog or breed specific owner. Jester thrives under structure and schedule. He likes to know what will happen and what is expected of him. He will need a new owner that can continue to work with him on behavior modification. He will spin in his crate as he has been overly confined in the past. He has had vet several times. He is nervous at the vet so it is recommended to keep him muzzled to prevent any mishaps. \n\nBecause of his lack of socialization he is nervous around new people. He is also nervous in large crowds. Upon meeting he may stiffen, lick lips, or stare. He may pace when nervous also. Given a slow introduction with people and time, he will eventually seek attention and pets. He should be allowed to do this on his own and at his own pace. \n\nHe currently lives with 3 other dogs. 2 of these dogs are female and he gets along well and plays with the female. He does not get along well with the male. Because of these reasons it is recommended that he have a home with no other pets or only a female playmate companion. He would do best with a less dominate female. Absolutely no cats. \n\nJester will not be placed in a home with children as he does not do well with unpredictable movement. His personality is more independant and cat like. He prefers to be people neutral. He has also had some minor resource guarding in the past, therefore, he is not a good candidate to sleep in bed with his owner or nearby. \n\nJester loves to go on walks and hikes. He also is very content to play in his backyard on his own. His favorite toys are a ball and a larger jolly ball. \n\nHe would best thrive in a home with no other animals, no kids, and where he will be provided with structure, clear boundaries, and kind but firm leadership as hes a sensitive boy. He prefers lower-energy households as too much activity heightens his anxiety and other unwanted behaviors. He would be best suited for a single person or couple who are able to spend a lot of time with him and work from home, are retired, or work shorter hours. Hes a good boy if given a chance but is slow-coming trying to recover from his time at the facility. He does not do well in a kennel setting. It extremely overstimulates him as it reminds him of where he lived for three years in a kennel with 100+ barking dogs.\n\nJester was extremely under weight when he was finally released from the facility. He has since gained 25 pounds and is now a healthy 75 pounds. \n\nIf you have questions about this pet please contact us at info@madrescueinc.org\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this pet please complete an application at this link https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/24689/generic . \n\nWe are an official 501C3 organziation that does not have a physical location.

We quickly reclaimed him in order to find a family that is a better match for him. \n\nWe learned from his first family that Marley loves older children (9 yrs. and up).  He is not as comfortable with toddlers.  He does well with cats and grew up alongside another dog (his brother Elliot).\n\nMarley needs to be with his people the majority of the time and he needs daily exercise/healthy stimulation.  His former family had to spend significant periods of time away from him .  Marley will benefit from socialization and some positive training.  \n\nMarley is a little shy at the moment, but is easily won over with loving attention, play, and treats.\n\nHe is neutered, fully vaccinated, and ready to go home today.  He has been house-trained.  You may visit Marley by appointment at our shelter near San Luis, CO.  We practice safe COVID-19 protocols.\n\nIf interested, please email us: woof@slvaws.org",

            "description": "Name: Coco\nGender: Female\nAge: 10 years\nWeight: 6.7 lbs.\nAdoption Fee: $150\nFostered in Slidell, Louisiana\n\n8/5/20 - Coco had an appointment with the Ophthalmologist on 7/30/20.  He said she was a very good little girl.  His findings were that she has a hypermature cataract in her right eye and can only see shadows and an immature cataract in her left eye.  Her foster mom says that she gets around fine and doesn't bump into things.  They put her on two medicines.  1) Ketorolac Ophthalmic Solution (5 ml), 1 drop in each eye once daily which is for inflammation; and 2) Dorzolamide/Timolol Ophthalamic (10 ml), 1 drop in each eye once daily which is to relieve intralocular pressure.  \n\nCoco is a sweet little girl that absolutely loves belly rubs.  If you rub her belly, she will fall fast asleep.  No lie.... out like a light.  This senior girl would make a great addition to a quiet, laid back home.\n\n7/26/20 - I have an appointment with the doggy opthalmologist on 7/30 because the vet was concerned about the cataract in my right eye and wants me to get it checked out.  So, say a couple prayers that everything is ok, and I will update you when it's over.\n\nFoster mom said that since we do not know when my birthday is since I was found stray, we are calling July the month I was born.  The vet estimated my age at 10, and I came to foster mom on the 5th, sooooo, my birthday is July 5, 2010.  I assumed that since we now know my birthdate, there would be a huge party for me, but foster mom said that due to this stupid COVID-19, we couldn\u2019t have one.  I understand, but that doesn\u2019t stop you from sending me gifts and emails wishing me a Happy 10th Birthday.\n\nThere are two other dogs here at my foster home and I\u2019m cool with them, except when that female one gets in my face, I won\u2019t back down.  I might not have a last name like her, but I\u2019m not one to be bullied, so don\u2019t start something that you don\u2019t want me to finish.\n\nI love all people, but since foster mom is the one that feeds me, I tend to follow her around a lot.    I have picked up a toy or two and played with them, but my favorite thing is belly rubs.  I will lay beside foster mom and will fall asleep with her rubbing my belly.  I have had a few accidents, but we have a doggy door here and I picked up on it in the first couple of days and foster mom said that I am using it pretty well.\n\nI can jump on and off the sofa, and use the steps to the human bed.  I haven\u2019t been scared of the bad weather we have had lately.  I do give kisses and will bark at loud noises and if my foster siblings bark I\u2019ll chime in.  My bark is a little high-pitched and loud, so it\u2019s a good thing I don\u2019t do it alot.  I\u2019m currently eating hard and soft food and love it.  Foster mom said that I am a sweetheart and pick up on things rather quickly.  The one that I do that she is not fond of is hump.  I am spayed already, so not sure this will totally go away.  Seems I\u2019m not picky, I will hump your shoes, your arm, whatever is there.  She is letting me know that this is not very lady like and I really want to be a classy lady, so I\u2019m trying to be better.\n\nI\u2019m learning to be spoiled here, but it would be nice to have a castle all to myself with parents that are ready to make me official and give me their last name.  I was in very bad shape when I was found and no one knows anything about me and my previous life.  So, even though you can\u2019t change my past, you can help rewrite my future.  And once adopted, and all of this COVID-19 mess is over, you can throw me the biggest, baddest birthday party any diva has ever seen.  I won\u2019t object.\n\nOops, there\u2019s foster mom\u2019s arm, gotta go!\n \n7/7/20 - We were able to get Coco into the vet yesterday and she is estimated to be 10 years of age.  Her hair loss is from severe flea allergies.  Understandable since she had to have 3 baths when first found just to get all the fleas off of her.  She received shots for her skin issues and a medicated shampoo.  She will go back next week for her shots and then can have her dental done.  She was heartworm negative which was awesome to hear.  Her foster mom says she is a sweetheart.\n\nThanks to everyone who donated and had Coco in their thoughts.  We will keep you updated about her and will update her bio once we learn more about her personality.  Coco hopes everyone has a great day!\n\n7/5/20 - Coco is the newest throwaway, hot mess to our program.\n\nShe was found on the streets in this condition. Attempts have been made to try and locate an owner, but no one seems to be looking for her. \n\nWe will hopefully get a vet appointment soon to find out what is going on with her skin and to check her heartworm status along with getting her shots up-to-date. We are sure she will need a dental and possibly be spayed at that point.  We will also get an estimate on her age and get her weight at that time as well.\n\nThe main thing right now is to keep her comfortable, give her love, good food and treat her the way that she\u2019s obviously not been treated before.\n",

They are both neutered males, approximately 8 years old and have been together their whole lives.  Their owner died and they were left behind.  They are extremely LOW energy, do not like to walk on a leash and are trained to use wee wee pads.  They re happiest sitting side by side next to each other.  Coco has bad knees so walks very slowly.  They would be great lap dogs or quiet companions for a quiet home.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT?\n\nIf you would like to meet, foster or adopt this pet, please fill out our online FOSTER/ADOPTION APPLICATION which can be found in the main menu of our website or at the bottom of this page - simply copy and paste the link into your browser. EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY:  Meetings at our Adoption Center are by appointment only (no walk-ins).  An online adoption application is required and must be approved prior to meeting any animals.  Adoption appointments are set up by email by our Adoption Coordinator (no phone calls, please).  This process ensures our dedicated time to the animals in our care, as well as full attention to adopters at scheduled times.  \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

They are both neutered males, approximately 8 years old and have been together their whole lives.  Their owner died and they were left behind.  They are extremely LOW energy, do not like to walk on a leash and are trained to use wee wee pads.  They re happiest sitting side by side next to each other.  Coco has bad knees so walks very slowly.  They would be great lap dogs or quiet companions for a quiet home.\n\n\nWHAT'S NEXT?\n\nIf you would like to meet, foster or adopt this pet, please fill out our online FOSTER/ADOPTION APPLICATION which can be found in the main menu of our website or at the bottom of this page - simply copy and paste the link into your browser.

He is dog aggressive, and a little vision impaired from untreated dry eye. We will only place Mack in a home that has prior experience dealing with difficult dogs, a fenced yard, and air conditioning. No small kids and no other animals. Please make sure you have the financial means to take care of a dog like this. Mack is awesome 99% of the time. He loves to explore the yard and is housebroken. We think he will make a great addition to the right family. He loves to go for walks and enjoys belly rubs.",

They definitely didn't have proper vet care either. We're thankful he asked for help. \n\nWeezy is a 12 year old female long haired chihuahua.  She knows her name and will run to you when called. She is super affectionate and her favorite thing is to snuggle next to her human. When she's really happy or excited her tail spins around like a pinwheel. It's adorable. She loves belly rubs and back scratches.  She likes to be picked up and held.  She will pretty much follow you wherever you go.  After she got comfortable at my place, she discovered her \u201cbark\u201d and will bark if someone knocks at the door and sometimes barks at people walking by if we\u2019re on the porch, but it isn\u2019t very loud and really kind of cute.  She gets along with my medium sized dog and doesn\u2019t seem to notice or care about my cat but was afraid of bigger dogs at the rescue. The only negative is that she is not housetrained.  She mostly uses the pee pads, but not always.  She loves to go on walks but only pees during walks occasionally.\n\nShe is spayed, heartworm negative, and microchipped. She had a negative fecal. She is up to date on vaccinations, heartworm prevention and flea prevention. She's had several great exams. She had a dental with bone grafts. She will have to have yearly dentals to prevent the few left from further decaying. She will be required to go to a vet with dental xrays. We prefer Dr Hill at Maple Small. Her lower canine are holding the jaw together so they cannot be pulled. She had some teeth pulled. She is 6 lbs. Her bloodwork is perfect. Her adoption fee is $200. \n\n She is located in New Orleans LA. Email animalhelperneworleans@gmail.com for an application",

            "description": "Wilson is a handsome 5-year-old! He is neutered, up to date on vaccinations, microchipped, and crate trained. \n\nWhen Wilson first arrived in the MLBR program, he had to be moved from his foster home because he was just not adjusting to, or accepting of, having a fur-sister. Wilson will do best in a single-dog home as the one-and-only dog; no cats, no critters, no chickens, no exceptions. \n\nIf Wilson\u2019s forever family has friends or other family members with dogs, we would recommend taking advantage of the fact that Wilson is crate-trained because meeting or playing with other dogs is definitely not on his like-list and not in his best interests given his prior altercations. He is perfectly content to sit-it-out until fur-guests have left the building though.\n\nWilson is quite content to be an only-dog. He loves the affection and attention of his human family. He has a little difficulty meeting new and unfamiliar people, but he does warm up if not pushed. The ideal adopter for Wilson would have a household that has less frequent traffic of friends and family.\n\nWilson can potentially be a jogging companion! He started jog-training while in his first foster home and did well. With a little bit of refresher training, he should get right back into the jogging routine without great difficulty. Walks would be very beneficial for Wilson if you don\u2019t jog; at this point, he still needs reminders not to pull or exhibit reactive behaviors and is mindful when told to mind his own business. Wilson also enjoys yard-zooming, so a fully fenced yard (6-feet minimum) is a must, no exceptions. \n\nThis special boy needs a special home. If you have that home, you\u2019ll be well-rewarded with the loving companionship of handsome Wilson!

            "description": "Berlin Mannlich T. (or just Berlin for short) is a strikingly handsome 9-year-old male German Shepherd Dog (GSD) that arrived at a Southern California shelter as a stray. On his arrival, t he had several medical conditions that had been neglected by his prior owner. He seemed to have spent much of his time outdoors and likely did not have too many comforts of a loving home. \n\nBerlin T. Summary:\n- Berlin is a Male, 9 yrs old, weighs 84lbs, current on shots, neutered, house-trained\n- Good with Adults, kids (middle-school aged or over), dogs (small and large), cats, and travel in the car\n\nBecause he was a stray there were little or no details of his prior life that we could directly confirm. There was one substantial source of feedback on his history, however... and that was Berlin himself. By observing his condition and behavior it does give us some insights. Without looking too hard we can tell that Berlin was likely an outside dog. We suspect this because the tips of his ears show evidence of \"flystrike\". Flystrike is an irritation of a dog's ear tips caused by biting flies. This is most commonly seen in warm weather areas (like S. California) and primarily affects dogs confined to the outdoors in the summer and fall. Flystrike is most often caused by the common stable fly, however, many other fly types are sometimes involved. The end result is that the tips of the dog's ears are somewhat scared and often devoid of hair where they were constantly being bitten.\n\nThe most pronounced medical needs that were evident when Berlin arrived at the shelter were the visible masses that protruded from his left front forearm and on his right rear hip. You can see these masses in his included photo and video collection. The right hip mass is the most noticeable and the forearm mass shows evidence that Berlin had been licking or possibly scratching it. The masses by themselves are not so alarming in a senior-aged dog since many of these turn out to be fatty masses or are otherwise static and harmless. In this case, however, the shelter examined Berlin and determined the proper course of treatment was to surgically remove the masses and since Berlin had not yet been neutered this would also be done while he was under anesthesia.\n\nUnfortunately, what must have seemed like a straight forward surgery did not turn out to be so simple. The larger of the masses on Berlin's hip was removed without complication but the mass on his forearm could not be dissected away from the cephalic vein so it was only partially removed. Tissue samples were taken and did show that both masses were benign however so the focus of his post-op treatment was centered on pain control and surgical wound care. As these activities were beyond the shelter's limited resources a call went out to Animal Welfare Organizations that might be suited to assist. Thulani Senior German Shepherd Rescue (TSGSR) answered the call and has rescued Berlin from the shelter. A TSGSR specialized foster home in N. California stepped in to provide his post-surgical and recovery care.\n\nBerlin made good progress after surgery but his mobility is still limited. He loves to walk short distances each day and it is clear that he really looks forward to going out but he does have difficulty getting into and out of cars without help and his size can make it difficult to offer help. When he is at home Berlin is quite happy relaxing in the house. His main thing is he wants to chill with his people. He also loves his play toys and mealtime is his favorite time of day. \n\nOne of the side effects of the prior shelter surgeries was that they left Berlin with a medical condition where he needs a little help when it is time to poop. About an hour or so after a meal he will likely need to poop and he will then look to his person to \"push a button\" (or really a spot around his hip) that allows him to successfully defecate. This may sound difficult but it is not messy or complicated. He also needs medications daily with each meal. \n\nThe best home for Berlin will have a small yard with easy access from the house and a family that sees his abilities rather than his challenges. We continue to work on Berlins recovery and will update this bio as he progresses. He is one of those dogs that you soon realize makes your home a much warmer place just by being there. \n\nPlease join us in welcoming Berlin to TSGSR. \n\nWhat's Next for Berlin T.:\nThulani Senior German Shepherd Rescue (TSGSR) will continue to see that Berlin is well cared for and receives all medical care needed for his well being. In addition, TSGSR is beginning a search for an adoptive home that will care for him for the rest of his life. Berlin will come to his new home with a supply of food, a cushy pad if wanted, and other goodies such as toys. \n\nBerlins medical expenses will be covered for the rest of his life by Thulani Senior German Shepherd Rescue (TSGSR)!\n\nIf you want to learn more about Berlin, or are possibly interested in providing an adoptive or foster home, please send us a message by clicking on the \"Ask About Me\" button. We will often get feedback or \"updates\" from a dog's foster home and as any updates become available they will be included here.\n\nIf you are reading about Berlin on Petfinder.com sometimes an available YouTube video is not listed.

            "description": "Mowgli is a very Zen guy who prefers the companionship of smaller female dogs. Male dogs do not bring out the best in his personality for some reason, but he does fine in a play group of smaller female dogs. Despite his size, he's pretty sure he's a lap dog. If you're not sitting down, he's just as happy leaning against your leg. Being close to you is favorite place. We've noticed he has some resource guarding tendencies, no doubt from going a long time without food or care. Our trainers will work with adopters to resolve this issue.\n\nMowgli was brought into Dallas Animal Services as a stray and his condition was deplorable; he had mange and severe hair loss and flies had eaten away all the hair on his ears. Since being with us, he's a perfect gentleman in his crate, waits his turn to go outside, but is not a fan of the outdoors, now that he knows and appreciates air-conditioning. Mowgli would much prefer to be inside and lying peacefully in his crate. He'll make a great companion for the right family who's willing to give him the time and attention he's never known.",

I am very good at paying attention to hand signals though and know when to get up to be pet. I am very sweet and get along well with other dogs. I would make a great addition to any laid back family and can't wait to meet my forever fosters. I'm a very loyal companion my caretakers describe me as perfect.\n\nAll potential Forever Fosters must reside within 100 miles of Mt Juliet, TN. All Forever Fosters dogs will have any medical expenses paid for by the sanctuary for the duration of their lives.\n\nTo fill out a Forever Foster application, please visit our website at ofsds.org",

I also take great pride in my appearance, so if you could help me trim my nails, clean my ears, and top it off with a good brushing, I'll be very appreciative. I can not wait for my forever friend to find me!

            "description": "Born on Memorial Day (5/27/2019), Tulip was adopted as a 10 week old puppy and recently returned since she and her sister weren't getting along.  She does have resource guarding issues, so she needs to be fed and given treats in her own space.  She was diagnosed with Immuno-mediated Poly-arthritis and has been taking medications to remedy it.  She is doing well now, but it is possible it could reoccur.  Tulip LOVES people and is happy to cuddle with you every chance she gets.  She is anxious in new situations and will need some time to adjust in a new home (like any dog!).  She is a Pyr/German Shepherd/Husky mix.  She has the long nose of a GSD, and the Pyr double dews.  Her coat is shorter than that of a Pyr and has light tan spots in places.  She would do best in a home where her people are home more often than not and as an only dog, or with a calmer dog. Could Tulip be the one for you?\n\nTexas Great Pyrenees Rescue, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to Great Pyrenees. We have the best selection of Pyrs in Texas and we do home checks and vet checks before placement. We start with adoption applications (no cost/obligation) and we make placements on a first submitted-first approved basis. If you are interested in giving this dog a new home, please complete an adoption form found at http://www.txpyrs.org",

He's quite the player, but not the kind you're thinking of. Blake plays and he plays HARD. He must be matched with others like him because we fear he will be too much for a sensitive or reactive dog. If you're willing to take a chance on him, he'll accept your rose. Do you have room for a long haired Chihuahua mix at your pad?",

Molly is looking for an adopter with an active lifestyle who can keep her physically and mentally engaged. She\u2019s an adventurous girl and her favorite activities include tug, running, long walks, food puzzles, and training! Molly is a scholar and has already attended and excelled in numerous training sessions. We believe so much in Molly\u2019s potential that we have a college fund setup for her to go towards additional training classes upon adoption!  If you\u2019re looking for a fun, loving, and active companion then Molly is your girl!\n\nWant to bring me home? It's easy! All you have to do is fill out an application on our website: acadianaanimalaid.org/adopt/dog-adoption/application \n\nOur adoption fee is $225 for puppies and $205 for adults. All AAA dogs are up to date on all vaccinations, spayed or neutered, on heartworm preventative, and microchipped. \n\nDogs are individuals -- The shelter software system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of our dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We encourage you to select your new companion by considering each dog's individual personality and pet qualities instead of relying on a breed label that is only a guess.",

Incontinence, the world is her toilet :: special needs is splendidly spectacular & Murphy Brown Moon Shadow is absolutely magical fantastical.\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMurphy Brown hails from the streets of MexiCali, Mexico. While her full background is unknown, what we do know is she was paralyzed for quite a while, surviving on the streets until a rescue Samaritan saw her immediate need and took her for emergency medical care in January 2020. Thus started Murphy Brown\u2019s journey of healing in mind, body, and spirit and her becoming the dog she was supposed to be under her wounds and emaciated body.\u00a0\n(medical) Murphy Brown is permanently paralyzed due to her broken spine at L1-L2, most likely sustained from being hit in the streets in Mexicali. Her rear legs are without use and they have muscle atrophy, making them small and thin, but she doesn\u2019t mind if you call them ballerina feets. Without medical care or walking assistance, upon being rescued she had severe open wounds on her rear legs going down so far as the bone on her toes due to chronic dragging. Her private parts are well were one large lesion due to the friction of dragging. Since she is paralyzed, she cannot feel past the break in her spine, so thankfully she was unable to feel the wounds, which is a blessing, but also it means she could reinjure herself without feeling it.\u00a0\nMurphy Brown in also incontinent, which just means the world is her toilet, and she goes where she pleases (oh, to have such freedom!). While she can do some business on her own, she does require a caregiver to express her bladder multiple times a day to ensure no urine is sitting in her bladder and to prevent UTI\u2019s, which can become very serious in her paralyzed state. Murphy Brown can easily walk on her front legs (and by walk, we mean RUN just as fast as any 4 legged dog) and \u201cscoot\u201d with lightning speed. Precautions should be taken when she is scooting to make sure her legs and private areas don\u2019t get too beat up, as the dragging friction can create wounds that take a bit to heal. One bonus to this is her added wardrobe; she has a rotating closet of fun bandage colors, Velcro booties, and an assortment of leg covering options to give each day a little more accessories. Like most gals, this girls loves her accessories, and the best one of them all are her wheels. Animal Synergy immediately recognized the need for wheelchair that could give Murphy Brown the freedom she craved. They were able to get her an Eddies Wheels wheelchair, perfectly customized for her body, so she can stand or off-road to her heart\u2019s desire with limited weight on her front end. While her wheels are a complete game-changer, she cannot lay down or sleep in her chair, so it should only be used a few hours at a time at max. Murphy Brown being able to be off the ground, and run effortlessly, gives her the freedom of mobility that inspires her confidence and creativity.\u00a0Her wheels are made for walking, and that\u2019s just what they\u2019ll do, but watch out because some of the days, those wheels will run all over you. \u00a0\nThrough months of physical and medical rehabilitation under the direction of Animal Synergy, this skinny caterpillar has become a full-bodied butterfly, flying on her custom wheels with a zest for life and adventure that is infectious to everyone who meets her.\u00a0\n(Behavior) Murphy Brown has no idea she is paralyzed, and that\u2019s exactly how we aim for everyone to see her as well. Instead of paralyzed and incontinent, Animal Synergy sees a light brown dog who LOVES exploring, playing, and with boundless energy. She is paralyzed and perfect, 2 legs ain\u2019t no thang, and normal is boring anyhow. She can be thought of a super athlete, and if there was a dog Special Olympics, she would win gold to match her heart of gold.\u00a0\nShe has illimitable endurance and stamina. There are two Murphy Brown versions of \u201ctired\u201d, standing tired and mouth tired. Just because she is tired of standing, don\u2019t be fooled, she still has plenty of energy to play on ground level, chew, destroy, make you laugh till your sides hurt, and find every pair of shoes hidden from her mouth. Murphy Brown is very mouth-oriented, and really enjoys a good chew toy, but she is a super athlete in more than just her front end, she also has a very strong mouth and jaw grip and lives to shred toys that companies say no dog can shred. As her behaviorist noted, she has more endurance and is stronger than dogs 3 times her size, and balls tend to die a messy death in her presence. Murphy Brown can walk miles in her chair and still have plenty of energy to kill a dozen tennis balls after a full day of exploring and playing.\u00a0\nBut who needs balls and chew toys when you have friends around to chase, fellow snouts to paw, and a warm friend to cuddle up with? Murphy Brown does everything with intensity, and that extends to play\u2026 and love. She loves with her whole heart and her tiny feets. She loves her dog friends and family, and does well with dogs of all sizes and temperaments, but does best when not challenged by another dog. Being from the streets, she ain\u2019t no faker, she is still a strong, independent, alpha dog needing to project strength and control. With Animal Synergy, she has let the dogs lead her and show her the ropes of living in a home. She is genuinely curious of other dogs, and engages in play frequently and does not exhibit any \u201caggression\u201d but does try and be top dog {maybe this is just at my house because I have a bunch of weak, fake-alphas lol}.\u00a0\nFor kitties, she has laser like focus, and while she has not tried to eat any animal friends, she definitely stalks them (cats, gophers, chickens, fish\u2026) and should not be trusted to not try and take a small bite unsupervised\u2026 the faster they move, the faster she wants to move her mouth in their direction. While her breed is unknown, her behavior is all ball-obsessive lab mixed with street savvy, feeling good as hell, flower garden predator. While she is quite energetic, active, and playful, she is every bit as loyal, loving, and attached to her person as she is stealth killer of fuzzy toys.\u00a0\nMurphy Brown only knows how to grab life by the front legs and give it all her intensity. This is evident in her vast happiness, her play, and her ability to love. While she has no separation anxiety and is fine to be alone for a while (with a friend or chew toy preferably) she very much prefers to be around people. She will love back harder than you could ever love her, and she thinks her fur is made of Velcro (it\u2019s not) and her paws are made of butter (they aren\u2019t) but she still wants to attach herself to humans and paw them into love submission (she does).\u00a0\nMurphy Brown would do best in a home that understands her needs, but also knows she is not needy. She is consistently the happiest dog you can find. She loves learning new things, has no fear or reservations, and her only limit in life is the ones we put on her, as her body has no idea it has limits. She would do well with some canine friends because you always need a tribe that speaks your own language. Her ideal human family would be someone with a lot of patience, and willing to take a back seat on occasion and allow her to continue the healing momentum Animal Synergy has given her on the next upward and onward phase of her life.\u00a0\n",

If you have been looking for the perfect guy to hang out with and snuggle with THIS IS YOUR GUY!!!! He tends to like women more than men but will warm up to men if they are willing to give him a few days. At first he may bark and act a fool but after a few cookies are given, and when he knows you are not a threat, he will be your best friend. Because of his anxiety, kids are not recommended. Out of all the fosters that I have had, Wyatt is definitely the most snuggly. He wants to be with you at all times and always has to be touching your body while he sleeps. If you work from home he will lay beside you on the chair the whole day. He does have some anxiety at first, thinking you will leave him and never come back, but that goes away once he knows the routine and knows you will be back.\nWyatt likes most dogs, but he is an alpha if he is around a shy dog. He probably would prefer to be an only dog, but he does fine with all small dogs in the house. He is OK with cats, but will chase them sometimes, so it's best not to have cats for him to annoy.\nWyatt is 2-3 years old and weighs about 30 pounds. He would love to have a friend who will take him hiking or running and play ball in the backyard. Because Wyatt can be spooked easily at first, I would like him to go to a home with a fence so he can't run off. He is housebroken and does not like crates. He loves to ride in the car. He is neutered, up-to-date on vaccinations, heartworm negative, microchipped, and has had a 1-year heartworm prevention shot. Available through Tired Dog Rescue, Gulfport, MS. Fee: $125.

            "description": "Coco started his puppy life being chained up in a backyard and after a concerned neighbor stopped by and asked about him the family offered to let her take him home. She then reached out to TGPR for help! Coco is learning that being inside isn't as scary as it seems and picks up on learning commands quickly. He loves to play with other dogs and would do best in a home where he has a pup sibling to show him the ropes and give him some company inside. He loves to cuddle and will bury his bones to come back and get them later. \n\nPlease visit www.txpyrs.org for more information and to fill out an application for Coco. \n\nTexas Great Pyrenees Rescue, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to Great Pyrs.  We have the best selection of pyrs in Texas and we do home checks and vet checks before placement.  We start with adoption applications (no cost/obligation) and we make placements on a first submitted-first approved basis.  If you are interested in giving this dog a new home, please complete an adoption form found at http://www.txpyrs.org",

After all he's been thru, Hugo is one friendly, goofy and sweet boy.  He has your typical hound bark.  We don't know if he's even been in a home, but we know he would appreciate becoming part of your family.  We would like to see him have a big fenced yard to run around in.

He was found on the rooftop of an abandoned house- no idea how he got there. \n\nHe was skin and bones, with several medical issues that needed attention.  He is heartworm positive, but has already started his treatment for that, and will only need quarterly antibiotics and monthly Heartgard for a year before re-testing. \n\nHe has a slightly deformed rear foot, but it causes him no trouble at all. He loves to take long walks with his foster. \n\nAtilla has done PHENOMENALLY with kids at our adoption events, and loves everyone he meets! He is a big hit!\n\nAtilla does fine with other friendly dogs with PROPER INTRODUCTIONS.\n\nAtilla is UTD on vaccines, neutered, and has healed up from all the problems he had when we rescued him. (With the exception of his HW treatment that will continue for about a year or so)\n\nIf you can give this handsome boy a loving, stable home, please contact us today! He is waiting for you!\n",

            "description": "Scooby at this time is having many problems medical including kidneys faiilure. Scooby is 13yrs old. He is a little lover.  He does get along with other dogs as he loves with several other dogs as well as a cat and a very active kitten.  \n\nIf the animal is under the age of 3 years old or has health issues, a vet reference is required which means you must own a pet or have owned a pet in your name.\n\nAdoption fee of $250. covers all vetting including spay/neuter surgery, vaccines, microchip heartworm test and treatment if needed and any other medical that may be required while in rescue. \n\nWe only do adoptions on Saturday and not all animals are able to attend so if you would like to see a specific animal please let us know so that we can make arrangements for it to be present at the event. Event locations do vary so please check the homepage to find out where we will be this week. Please do not ask us to reduce adoption fees since all fees help us to cover medical expenses for all of our animals, some of which can be very expensive.  Saving lives is not cheap so thank you for your understanding and helping us save as many as possible.\n\nPlease email lowcountryanimalrescue@ymail.com for an application.",

I am a 2 year old, 55 pound Mountain Cur mix. I am already house trained and kennel trained, and am even a graduate of the Pups 4 Parole training program, so I know lots of basic obedience commands. I am good with other dogs with proper introductions and would do well with dog savvy cats who won't be scared by my energy and playfulness. Human kids make me nervous, so I would not like to share my home with any of those please. I am looking for a lowkey home with a dog savvy owner who is able to keep up with my training and help build my confidence with new people. I love to run and stretch my long legs, so I need a 6ft privacy fenced yard in which to get some exercise, and an active owner who likes to go for runs, walks, or hikes. I will keep up my hard work of preparing to be your new best friend if you promise to fill out that application so we can get started on our adventures together.\u00a0\n\nMy adoption fee is $150 and includes my spay/neuter, vaccinations, wellness exam, heartworm test, and microchip! If you're interested in meeting/adopting me, please visit www.rescueonespringfield.com/our-adoption-process/adoption-application/ and fill out the form! We do adopt out of state with vet references and video home check. *Adopter is responsible for coming to get the dog and returning the dog if the adoption does not work out* \n\nDon't forget to LIKE us on Facebook!-www.facebook.com/rescueonespringfield\n\n*Remember, dogs are pack animals. Because of this, Rescue One does not adopt to outdoor-only homes. Pets are family and are not disposable.  Please make sure that you are 100% committed to a pet before considering adding one to your home.",

Ace has a scholarship for 5 lessons with the same trainer for his lucky adopter ! ( see video below of Ace in a recent class). Ace plays great in an off leash playgroup with other large dogs but can still be reactive on leash .\n\nThe best home for Ace will be with an adopter experienced with reactive dogs ......with our trainer he behaves beautifully in a group class so we know he can :-)\n\nOne on one with Ace he is a wonderful affectionate dog and an amazing athlete !\n\nPlease request a meeting with fun-loving Ace today! If you are not yet approved to adopt from All Shepherd Rescue, please fill out our online application at www.allshepherdrescue.com. Our adoption fee is $350.00.\n\nThank you Julia C. for sponsoring Ace in January!",

            "description": "ADOPTION REQUIREMENTS\nFenced yard\n\n\nMy name is Smokie and my sisters name is Nicole but our foster mom calls her Nikki. We are a bonded pair of Chihuahuas that have spent our lives in a kennel. Now that we are too old to do that we get to find our very first home and we would like that to be together,  We are tiny as you will read and we are both about 7 years old. My sissy has some heart problems that require her to be on daily medicine but don\u2019t tell her. She has no symptoms of anything so as far as she\u2019s concerned she\u2019s fine and we think she is too. The medicine will make her stay that way.\n\nThis is what our foster mom says about both of us...\n\nHowdy!\u00a0\u00a0My name is Smokie and I am a 5 \u00bd pound bundle of love.\u00a0\u00a0You see, I have spent my life helping a breeder instead of getting to live the life I deserve. Now that I know what love and caring can be, I am livin\u2019 the dream.\u00a0\u00a0I absolutely love to cuddle with my foster mom, foster sister and resident dogs.\u00a0\u00a0I follow my foster mom everywhere because I don\u2019t want to miss an opportunity to be loved.\u00a0\u00a0My foster mom also calls me Smokie the Adventurer.\u00a0\u00a0I love to explore the back yard and have even tangled with a bee and won. Everything is new and I can\u2019t explore enough.\n\nI am crate trained, and mostly house trained. You see I never had to ask permission before so still learning. But if you take me out regularly and frequently, I will do just fine as I learn the rules. I will do best with calmer smaller dogs as I don\u2019t see my tiny size as limiting. A stable environment with not a lot of excitement is best where I can be provided with all the attention I deserve.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I don\u2019t know about cats, haven\u2019t met one to know if I will like cats.\n\nHello!\u00a0\u00a0My name is Nicole (aka Nikki) and I am 5 \u00bd pounds of pure love.\u00a0\u00a0I have spent my life making puppies for a breeder so I didn\u2019t really know what being loved was all about. Now that I know, I am making the most of it.\u00a0\u00a0I am timid, but once I found out what being in a loving and caring home is like, I am thriving.\u00a0\u00a0I don\u2019t think I have ever barked for my foster mom, so I am really quiet. I am the perfect lapdog, I will let you hold me for as long as you want. I love to cuddle with my foster mom, foster brother and resident dogs. I am such a cutie, I even have a brown spot on my back to show how special I am. You can even find me watching TV.\n\nI am crate trained, and mostly house trained.\u00a0\u00a0I am learning so if you take me out regularly and frequently, I will do great as I learn the rules. I will do best in a house with calmer smaller dogs. A calm environment with not a lot of excitement is best as I adjust to my new dream life. I don\u2019t know about cats, haven\u2019t met one to know if I will like cats.\n\nWe have come to love each other a lot and if someone would want to adopt both of us, our lives would be complete.",

            "description": "We would like you to meet the incredibly handsome, Mark! He is a 4 1/2 year old lab looking for a very special home. Mark came to us after living for nearly a year in a southern shelter. He instantly stole our hearts with his shy demeanor and soulful eyes. Mark was quickly adopted, but ran away as he can get spooked easily. After being trapped, Mark was relinquished back to us and adopted again. After Mark settled in his new home, he developed anxiety whenever his mom left her home. Mark was returned again and spent time with our trainer to learn more about him. Mark will need a very dedicated home with lots of patience. He will always be a flight risk, so a secure 6 foot fence is required for him. Mark would also do best in a home without other dogs or children. Mark has so much love to give, he just needs the right home to settle into. \n\n*We are closed to the public for viewing. Please email adoptions@pawstinleypark.org if you are interested in adopting Mark.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this pet, please visit our website to check on their current availability: http://www.pawstinleypark.org.. Adoptions are limited to 50 miles from the shelter. We do not ship animals. Adoption fees for dogs are $125-$275 based on age. While we do our best, we cannot make guarantees on breed, exact age and house training of our dogs. Peoples Animal Welfare Society (P.A.W.S.) of Tinley Park, IL is a no-kill non-profit 501(c) (3) organization.\n\nPhone: 815-464-7298\n",

            "description": "Hi, I\u2019m Onyx, a beautiful 3 year old girl. I was found roaming the streets as a stray so I\u2019m learning all kinds of new things in my foster home. I\u2019m a very sweet but extremely nervous around new people. I am still very uncomfortable and scared on a leash so a home with a fenced yard is a MUST. My foster mom says I need someone who is very patient to be my forever person.  I absolutely hate crates and will fight to not go into one and then will be very afraid to come out.  Once I trust you, all I wants to do is to sit in your lap and snuggle. At night, I will cuddle up to you to sleep. I start under the covers then during the night will get on top of covers so I can be closer to you.  Love, Love, love belly rubs\u2026. I will lay on my back and sleep while my belly is being rubbed, then I will thank you with lots of kisses.  I am fine going outside as long as you hang with me; I don\u2019t want you too far away at any given time. I enjoy my fenced back yard as I like to run and chase my K9 fosters siblings and squirrels so a playmate would be great.  I can climb a chain-link fence so I need a wood or a vinyl fence to keep me secure in the yard. Since I am still nervous of new people and situations a home with young kids is not ideal for me.  I\u2019m doing Ok with car rides as long as they are not too long. If you have the time and the heart to help me be all that I can be please consider me for your fur-ever girl.  Onyx is spayed, up to date on all vaccines, had a heart worm test, on heartworm preventative, had a fecal, and microchipped. Onyx\u2019s adoption fee is $300.00. Out of state adopters are responsible for arranging transport, WE DO NOT SHIP DOGS. For events calendar and adoption application please go to our website at aaprescue.org. A young dog is a 10-15 year commitment. Many dogs are surrendered to us because their owners are no longer able to care for them due to their health. We try to place young dogs and puppies in active, busy families. We encourage seniors to look at age appropriate dogs",

Willow is more confident so her sister Halo definitely looks to her for guidance. These little ladies are glued at the hip but love their people just as equally as each other, Halo is a little nervous and unsure in a new environment but it doesn't take long for her to open up and make herself at home. They are very calm indoors and you'll find them either sharing a toy at playtime or snoozing with each other, where one is the other is sure to follow. They are also pretty active in terms of the outdoors and love going on walks, they also love to do zoomies in the backyard so having a secure yard to play in is definitely a plus, they do bark at outside noises but are great at following direction and will stop when told to. They are good with other dogs but would prefer to be in a home as only dogs or only one other well adjusted dog. They are both eager to please, cuddly and learn very quickly. They are both so well behaved, crate trained and house trained.\n\nIf you are not ready to adopt just yet and would like to help in other ways, please consider clicking on the green \u201cSponsor Me\u201d button above to help this dog receive the best care we can give. We rely on the generosity of others to make rescuing dogs possible.\n\nIF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING THIS DOG, PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU HAVE READ THE DOG'S INFORMATION CAREFULLY.

In his last home he spent most of his time free to roam in the home with no issues. This smart boy knows sit, stay, come and give paw! Per his prior owner, he has a very fun personality! He loves toys and loves to play. He does well with kids 7 and up, and is learning to be gentle. He is energetic and loves the outdoors. Would make a great hiking partner! He loves to steal socks! He listens well and is pretty obedient. He is a heavy chewer and enjoys Kong toys. He loves to be pet and lay on you. He is food motivated so he learns fast when any treat is involved.",

            "description": "Halo is the sweetest girl. & has no idea that she's not a lap dog.  She absolutely loves to relax on the sofa & cuddle. She is super smart and obedient in the house.  She is also strong at the same time and needs some leash training to learn not to pull.  She is great with kids and small dogs, although she has started to be selective with larger dogs.  She was rescued from a kill shelter and deserves to know the love of a forever family.  \n\nYou can complete an adoption application on our website at:  \n     www.onceuponatailrescue.com\nor\n     Scroll down on this page & click \"More About Us\", & then click \"Adoption            Application\" underneath our bright Pink logo. \n\nIf you want to meet a pup in person, Once Upon a Tail Rescue does adoption events at PetSmart in Covington, LA on most Saturdays with many of our adoptable dogs there. \n\nDon't forget to complete your application ahead of time, so you don't miss out on the pup you've connected with.  If pre-approved, you have first priority & can usually take home your new best friend the same day!  \n\n*Please note that there is no obligation to adopt by completing an application.*\n\n**All dogs are required to have complete vet services, including shots, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip, which are included in the Adoption Fee. Some dogs may still require completion of these services due to current age, size, breed and/or health. All vet services must be done at the vet clinic used by Once Upon a Tail Rescue.",

Our veterinary partner estimates that Gunner is 2 years old at the time of intake in July 2020. Gunner is good with people of all ages and other dogs. All this handsome guy knew of life was the short wire he was tied to in someone's backyard, without a human word or touch, suffering with no shelter from the rain, heat and cold, eating only sporadic meals and water oftentimes placed out of his reach. But on the 4th of July, Gunner's independence was finally won and he was rescued from that life! Gunner is now a Rescue Dogs Rock NYC pup and that means his life will be something to celebrate. Gunner spent his entire life watching the world pass by without him, and he is now learning how to live in that world inside a home where he is loved and cherished. Gunner will need a patient, understanding family that is willing to work with Gunner and continue the training Gunner is currently receiving as he acclimates to life off of a chain. If you can open your heart and home to Gunner, please apply online to adopt Gunner at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

We do not have a shelter -- all dogs are fostered in private homes. \nIf you are reading about Coco she is available.\nApplication is required.\nCoco is an 8-10 year old sheltie that has lost her home.  She is a cute as they get. She came in with her mother who has since gone to the Rainbow Bridge.  Coco is a sweet 9 pound sheltie,  loves her person, loves affection.  She walks ok on a leash, but does not enjoy socializing. She was neglected for awhile when the owner became ill so she is learning to potty out side.  so one must offer her potty breaks often so she gets used to where she is suppose to go. This means she is not house trained.  \nApplication is required, fenced yard is idea as she is under socialized.  She will walk on a leash but is fearful of her surroundings.  Not yet fully house trained due to having only the access of her home environment to do her business.  She prefers to potty on concrete.  Used for breeding and having never been an only dog an older male that is calm and respectful she may do well.",

Freckles will do best in a house with a yard, so that he can patrol and make sure all of the rodents have cleared the property. He enjoys walking, running, fetching, jumping and playing. He is active dog extraordinaire, so if you are looking for a hiking/running/biking buddy, Freckles could be your guy. It is recommended that Freckles be the only dog in the house, as his loyalty, energy, and toy drive can make him difficult to coexist with for other dogs. Freckles is also extremely treat and ball motivated, so perhaps you are looking for a dog to hide treats in the house from or you need to work on the shoulder strength with throwing balls all day for him. Freckles cannot be in a home with cats. Freckles is ready to be someone's best friend as he clings to his human very loyally, is he the right fit for you? If you are interested in Freckles, please fill out an application on our website, www.highsierraanimalrescue.org. We do not discuss potential adoptions without an already submitted application.",

Our veterinary partner estimates that Boomer is a year old as of November 2020. Boomer is best suited for a home with older children or an adult only home with an active family that can keep up with him. He has a ton of energy and can take time to acclimate and would be best in a quiet home with a yard and a larger doggy sibling. No city or apartment living for this guy and best in a home without cats. This adorable little guy was in rough shape when Rescue Dogs Rock NYC found him, but after some veterinary care, a spa visit and some TLC, he is now on the yellow brick road to his forever home. If your home is at the end of Boomer's yellow brick road, please apply online to adopt Boomer at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

I am energetic and would do well in an active home where my family wants to continue my training - I love treats so treat training is fun! I love people but due to my size, energy, and play style do best with adults, or older children with close supervision. I'm currently working on being a good walking/running companion on my leash.\n\nI also love car rides where I can stick my head out the window and enjoy the breeze. I know my manners like only going potty outside, sleeping in my kennel at night, (mostly) not jumping on furniture, and coming when called.",

He is an AKC registered 5 1/2 year old from championship lines, with a few points of his own no less! \n\nOur volunteers already love this big boy, and can\u2019t wait to see him have a family of his own. He was rescued from a puppy mill auction where he had been repeatedly bred for profit. Now Flash is ready for his first loving forever home. He loves to go for walks, and he is an easy walk. He likes sniffing smells along the trail, greeting people. He shows little prey drive but is protective of his humans. He seems undisturbed by the presence of other dogs, so with work he might be able to abide a female canine. Everyone who meets him loves his manners. Hurry, this boy won\u2019t last!\n\nFor more information on Flash,  please contact Deanna O\u2019Brien at marsakita@sbcglobal.net or 773-594-9302. MARS has akitas available for fostering and adoption at several midwest locations. Visit our website, akitas.org, for more details on this and all our other akitas.",

These 2 poor dogs were taken to animal control where they ended up on the list to be euthanized. Lucky for them we heard about their story and knew we had to help them.\n\nLexy is a sweet dog that gets along with other dogs and people. While she came in with Lacey, they do not have to stay together and are each fine on their own and like to make new friends. She also rides great in the car as you can see from her \"Freedom Ride\" pic when we got her out of harm's way at the pound.\n\nLexy weighs about 60 lbs and just wants someone who will not get rid of her like her last family.\n\nShe's always been in a home so we would love to get her into a new forever home. Fill out an app on Lexy at www.scoutshonor.org.",

Nibble also seems to be house trained.\nWe got Nibble from our dog pound about 3 years ago.  When she arrived at our rescue, she was so thin and appeared to have been bred many times, by the previous owner, having several litters of puppies.  She either escaped from them or they decided they had enough puppies and dumped her. \nWhen Nibble first came to us she was food aggressive but not now.  She now has as much food as she wants.  She has gained weight, maybe too much, and is now a rather good looking young lady. \nShe loves any attention she can get.  She loves belly rubs and hugs.  She likes to play with her toys and has a couple of favorites.  She gets excited when we go into her kennel to clean and play a bit with her.\nNibble likes to be loved and is very lovable.  She is great with people but not so good with other dogs so should be an only dog in your home.  Nibble would love to finally have a family that loves her and shows her she is special.  Would you be that person for Nibble?",

Her original family did not spend the time to exercise her body and her mind and show Maple how to behave properly in their home. \n\nShe has few manners and will jump up on people (especially upon meeting), counter surf, chew items left on the floor such as shoes, throw rugs, etc. if she is not exercised daily and taught rules of the house.\n\nIronically, Maple is excellently trained with her obedience commands such as heel, sit, down, left paw/right paw, stay/wait, etc. and is highly\n motivated to learn new skills.\n\nMaple is very intelligent and catches on easily to new things and is highly food motivated which makes training VERY easy!\n\nA trainer has been working daily with Maple over the last few months to brush up on all of Maple\u2019s awesome obedience skills, boost her confidence and teach her how to relax and behave in an appropriate way with people and kids.\n\nThis girl is desperate for daily physical exercise and psychological stimulation. Maple LOVES to play ball and is easily exercised by using a Chuck It and a ball a few times a day.  Maple would be capable of learning any competitive dog sport such as Flyball, Agility or Disc and could easily be a running/jogging or hiking companion as she is very physically fit and has amazing stamina.\n\nOnce Maple catches on to how to behave and use house manners, builds some confidence and bonds with a human she will be an amazing addition to a lucky person.\n\nYOU MUST MEET ALL OF THE FOLLOWING REQUIREMENTS:\n\n\u2022 No children under 18 years of age\n\u2022 Previous dog experience with behavioural issues along with obedience training/obedience classes/competitive dog sports, police work, etc.\n\u2022 No other dogs in the home\n\u2022 Someone that works from home/retired to give Maple her physical/emotional needs \u2013 someone who will NOT be returning to a workplace after COVID \n\u2022 Fully fenced in yard\n- Must be 25 years of age and live in the Province of Ontario\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Maple please send us an email outlining your interest in Maple and tell us about yourself, your situation, your dog experience, where you live, your phone # and any other information you wish to tell us.  Please send email to deannaaarfrescue@yahoo.ca and we will give you a call to talk about Maple before moving on to the application process.\n\n***Please note: we require a completed application prior to meeting Maple, who is currently living in the Owen Sound area***\n\nAARF Rescue does not have a facility; dogs are in foster homes, vet clinics or boarding facilities.\n",

She does get along with other dogs when properly introduced and enjoys their company.\n\nWinnie is scared of most things -  loud noises, yelling, traffic noises...\n\nWe are looking for a special adopter for her -  once she loves you and trust you, it is with all her heart and soul - and she is worth the effort.\n\nShe needs a home where she can feel loved, safe, secure and valued.\n\nWe hope to find her a home with a patient owner who will work with her and show her that she is loved. Because it does take her a long time to bond, a home with no kids, no cats and preferable no other fur kids would be best for this sweet girl.\n\nShe is an amazing girl and deserves a good life.\n\nFenced yard and home check will be required on this sweet girl.",

She had a very bad skin infection when she came to Lizzy's back in June that apparently had been ongoing for a long time.  She looks so much better now...  We are seeing that she likes other dogs since she does a happy tail wag when she sees them and she is beginning to play bow, also.  Sunshine still gets medicated baths once a week and coconut oil and pumpkin in her food - which has done wonders for her skin and digestion.  The words that describe Sunshine best are:  Silly, happy, playful.  Sunshine would love to go for walks and explore the world of all those nice people she has not yet seen.  She absolutely loves car rides, also.  Sunshine is looking for a fantastic foster or a fabulous forever family.   Sunshine is heartworm negative.  She still needs to be spay once the vet gives us the OK in relation to her skin infection.",

PLEASE READ MY BIO BELOW TO LEARN MORE ABOUT ME AND HOW TO APPLY TO ADOPT :)\n\nMeet Rowan aka Earnest:: 4.5 years old, 60 pounds, Neutered male Pyrenees/Shepherd/Chow type/mix.\n\nAvailable for Adoption!\n\nRowan, who we are now calling Earnest, has found himself homeless after his family raised him from a puppy and he was loving and loyal to them for over 4 years before they abandoned him over their own neglect to provide proper supervision in their invisible fenced yard and had a very minor incident with someone who came into the yard unannounced. Earnest loved his family so much and he has been depressed and sad ever since they left him, with only fleeting moments of playfulness here and there. Earnest takes some significant time to warm up to his new people, but he does love to be pet and loved once he knows you're his friend. Earnest would do best as an only dog in the home, in a one person household with no children. \n\n$145 Adoption Fee. Please consider sponsoring Earnest's adoption fee by going to the DONATE tab on our website, here: https://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/donate/\n\nA $10.00 non-refundable application fee is required to submit your adoption application and will be deducted from your adoption fee if you are selected to adopt.\n\nAll Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue dogs are spayed/neutered, current on vaccinations, heartworm tested, current on heartworm and flea prevention, and microchipped.\n\nAlong with other criteria evaluated in the adoption application, a Fenced Yard is required to adopt. \n\nPlease see our Fenced Yard Requirements tab on our website for more information, here:\nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/fenced-yard-requirements/\n\nOur adoption area, unless otherwise specified in their bio, is within a two hour radius of Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue for adult dogs, and within a one hour radius for puppies. \n\nPlease see our Adoption Radius tab on our website for more info, here:\nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/adoption-radius/\n\nTO CHECK AVAILABILITY of any of our adoptable animals, please go to our available pets tab, here: https://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/available-pets-for-adoption/\n\nAll pets listed here are CURRENTLY AVAILABLE.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR PEPPERMINT PIG ANIMAL RESCUE:\n\nBefore completing the application, please read our ADOPTION PROCESS tab on our website, here: \nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/how-our-adoptions-work/\n\nTo complete our easy online adoption application, please visit our website at PeppermintPigAnimalRescue.org.\n\nAll adoption information and applications can be found under the ADOPTION CENTER tab.\n\nAdoption events are held every Saturday in our thrift store from 1:00pm to 4:00pm.

Recommended no children under 12 due to his size and how agile he is and likes to jump up and run and play.\n\nMeet Thor\nAge Apx 12\nBreed GP possibly Lab or Chessie Mix\n94 lbs\nNeutered\nDOB 10/15/2009\n\nA split with Thor's two legged guardians has left this very spry 12 years young boy in need of finding a soft spot to land. Thor's in excellent shape for his age.\n\nThor is a happy, happy boy and gets along with dogs big and small, cats and doesn't pay attention to the chickens.  He loves being a house dog and laying on a cool floor when it's too hot.   Because of his size I recommend kids over 12. or parents with kids who are used to large breeds. Thor uses the dog door is perfect in the house.  I've never heard him bark.  \n\nHe LOVES to go for rides and can get in my Rav4 and the back seat (floor) of my 1/2 T Chevy PU.   Thor would love someone who would walk him regularly and does decent on lead.  He likes for you to play with him with his toy duck or chicken.  His recall is good, but he does have a bit of a stubborn streak when he doesn't want to come back into the yard.   He does know sit, down, stay.  \n\nHe likes the water, but only up to his belly, not a swimmer.  He likes to stand in it. \n\n He has no food aggression with his regular food, treats or old femur bones with other dogs, but is protective if you give him a new bone.  . \n\nThor loves being with his people but does fine when he's left alone also.    He spent his entire life outside in a fenced yard and  now he's a house dog.  He has no interest going outside other than to go potty or with his person.  He adjusted to being a house dog right away, uses the dog dog and is perfect in the house and lays on his plush bed.  The only thing negative he does is jump up on the door when he wants to go with you.  \n\nHe just had his veterinarian visit and his blood work is perfect.  His ALT is very, very slighted elevated, but the veterinarian said that's normal for his age.  He does have an old CCL injury and occasionally favors a rear leg, but doesn't seem to cause him discomfort and there's no treatment needed. I have him on a joint supplement.\n\nHe's current on vaccinations and had a skin tag removed on the back of one knee.  His teeth are in perfect shape.  \n\nIf you believe this big happy go lucky boy is the perfect fit for your family, please contact us @ nutsforpets@yahoo.com or by inquiring on here and I'll send you a matchmaking form.  Home ownership and fenced yard required.  \n\nPlease note, if you can't tolerate a hairy, large breed dog who wants to hang out in the house and be with his person(s), then Thor isn't the dog for you.  \n \n\n \n\n \n",

            "description": "Hi there, I'm Josie! I'm a 3 year old female GSD possible malinois mix. I am on the smaller and leaner side for my breed, weighing in at about 65 lbs. I may be tiny but I sure am mighty. I am currently working on my impulse control and separation anxiety, and I am learning that I do not need to protect my Humans ALL the time. With strangers, I am known to be protective and can take my time to warm up to people. However, once I am well acquainted with people, I am quite a love bug and am very loyal! I am an eager and fast learner, and quite active. I will do best in an outgoing, active family who has recent and continued experience with GSD's. And I'm looking for that family or person to contnue my training and socializaion. I would do well in a home with teenagers, but would not do well in a home where children live or regularly visit. Having another young male dog to play with would be ideal, as I love to play and can run around for hours. I will not do well with cats and other small prey animals. I'm great with dogs and love to play with both small and large dogs, but can be a bit overwhelming for small and older dogs as my play style is more malinois than GSD. I would do best in a home with another young, active male dog to play with. I am house-trained and will do my business outside, or will whine to let you know when it is my time to go. I am an excellent companion in the car and I will occasionally like to weasel my way to the front. When I want something, I like to come up to you and lay my head on your lap and quietly whine to get you to play with me. If I seem like the right fit for your family, I assure that once I am acclimated in your home, there will never be a dull moment when I am around. I will be a loving, silly, sweet, and smart family member. Could I be the young lady you're looking for? I'm spayed, current on all vaccinations, heartworm negative, and microchipped. Mimimum adoption fee: $400.00\n\nIf you're interested in adopting Josie, please copy and paste the URL below to fill out an application. \n\nhttps://petstablished.com/adoptions/personal-information?application_type=Adopt&pet_id=759194",

Bentley (HWTH#20150A) and I were relinquished to Halfway to Home when our owner became ill and could no longer care for us.  I am calm, gentle and loving girl whose life was turned upside down but I am looking forward to finding a forever home.  I deserve a home where I am considered part of the family and given lots of love and attention. I need a fenced yard to play and get some sunshine.  I live with Bentley at the rescue and I do well with other dogs and kids, but cats aren't my thing. I may be a senior,  but I have lots of life left in me and I am longing to share it with a family.  If you are interested in a loving companion, and would like more information about me or would like to meet me, please call Sandy at tele# 661-824-4495 (this is a land-line phone).",

She has a smooth white coat with cool black markings that make her very unique looking.  \n\nJosie is a good size dog weighing 47 pounds and this is full grown.  Josie was pulled from our local animal shelter where she had been picked up as a stray and no one came to claim her.  \n\nShe is a very social butterfly and just loves to love on you!  She is a pretty active dog so she will make a great running/walking buddy to get you outside.  She may be too active for an apartment unless you give her plenty of daily exercise.  \n\nWe do know she is a CLIMBER and can scale a 6 foot chain link fence!  Yep impressive but guess we know why she was a stray!!  So she will need a privacy fence or always be on a leash when taken outside.  She has hound/pointer in her so she may take off after a scent if left outside unattended.  \n\nJosie did ok with calmer older dogs but not ones that were hyper and got in her space.  She should be fine with children 12 and up.  She does like to gentle jump on you to give you a hug!  We have started on her crate training.  \n\nJosie is up to date on her vet care, spayed, heartworm negative and is microchipped.  She is on heartworm and flea/tick prevention.  Looking for a loving, happy dog \u2013 Josie is the one!!\n\nAll HSWA dogs are either at our Dog Adoption Facility or in foster homes. All dogs require an appointment to meet.  Please call us at 205-554-0011 or email humaneswa@yahoo.com to request an appointment to see the dog/puppy and to check availability.\n\nVisit us on Facebook! www.facebook.com/humaneswa\n\nOur adoption fee is $75.  Read more information on our adoption process at www.humanesocietyofwa.org/howtoadopt.html.  Then, if you feel your home might be the right forever home and you would like to adopt a dog, submit an online adoption application. The online applications may not work on mobile devices. If the online application does not work on your device, look to the right side of the forms page for a downloadable .PDF copy of the application.",

This young lass has curious past, and FFR, our fosters, and trainers are all working on giving her the best paw forward. She is potty trained, has all the foundations of basic obedience and then some! That's because she is a lucky pupil with Method K9. Raina also loves to spend time snugglin when she's not studing so hard, and movie nights are one of her favorite. Raina tends to be a home body, so she is looking to share her days with a hooman who shares the same likes. She is doing wonderful through training and we are excited to find the pawsome family meant to be Raina's forever. If you would like to find out all the deets on our girl Raina, we encourage you to complete the application to adopt: https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/12564/generic",

She is partially paralyzed when she first came to us was dragging her rear end. She also was very overweight at18 pounds and should be more like 12. Since mid July in her foster home she's gone down to 14 pounds and started walking. Her walk is a bit funny and she occasionally falls to the side but can get back up again. She also can go up and down a couple of steps but her ideal home has no stairs.\n\nMini has been doing physical therapy and has greatly improved. Her adopter will get a special harness to support her back end on walks, an EMS machine to stimulate her muscles, and a balance disc to continue her exercises.\n\nBecause she is paralyzed that means she can not control her bladder and needs it expressed often plus frequent potty breaks. She needs someone who is absolutely understanding and is dedicated to giving her the best quality of life.\n\nCheck out this cute video one of her friends made to help her find a forever home. https://youtu.be/CF_jclLbNs4",

            "description": "I know what you are thinking...\"she's not a Pyr\".  Well, you are somewhat correct!  My name is Cynder.  One of my volunteer girlfriends decided to do a DNA test on me.  And then we had a guessing game while waiting for the results.  I'm not quite half Great Pyrenees with some St. Bernard, German Shepherd and Akita.  Who knew???\n\nI arrived at AGPR early December (2019) and gave birth to nine adorable pups a week later.  After fulfilling my maternal duties, COVID-19 came along.  A lovely family offered to foster me and I had a chance to experience the good life.  But now I am back at the kennels because my foster dad had to go back to work.\n\nWe've learned a lot from my foster experience.  I learned to play tag with an energetic four year old boy (I even let him win once or twice), love my cuddle time with my foster dad, and enjoyed taking naps on the sofa and LazyBoy.  \n\nIf there is one thing that is not \"pyrfect\" about me it is that I like to be around my people all the time.  If left alone in the backyard, I'm known to escape and go looking for my people or substitutes (kind neighbors will do). So we are all guessing that city life would not be a good thing for me.\n\nI do love my walks...my foster dad took me out at least once or twice a day.  And now I love when the AGPR volunteers take me out exploring.  My dream is to find a forever family with tons of time and love for me!\n\nAll Great Pyrenees require a fenced-in yard (at least four foot high). Since I'm special, we may consider an invisible fence IF you have demonstrated experience in training an independent thinking girl on how to obey the boundary.  If you have questions about the breed or our adoption policies and procedures, please go to our website at www.agprescue.org.  There's plenty of good information about the breed on our website - Pyrs aren't a breed for everyone!\n\nOur adoption application is online: http://agprescue.org/adoption-application/agpr-application-donations/  Please note that we are a small regional rescue organization.  We will consider adopting to families within a four to five hour drive to Richmond, VA",

They love to play with each other and other dogs their size. Their only fault is they are both timid dogs. Digger is a bit more shy then Benny. At their foster home they act like normal dogs. Once adjusted to a new home they should acclimate the same . Due to their shyness no one has given them a chance. At this point we would like to find Benny and Digger a home together. It would be more traumatic to separate. We think they will adjust to a new environment quicker as a pair. They need a quiet adult home with people who have time to continue their socialization. They are currently fostered north of Chico. \n\nAnimal Rescue Recon makes sure that each dog is current on its vaccinations, has been or will be spayed or neutered, and is microchipped to help keep pets out of the shelters and get them back home where they belong. For more information or to schedule an appointment contact Animal Rescue Recon (925) 392-7654\n\n-----\nPlease tell us a bit about yourself/family\n\u2022  What city do you live in?\n\u2022  Do you rent or own?\n\u2022  Any children in the home?  What ages? List all family members living in home\n\u2022  What is your work schedule?  Family schedule?\n\u2022  How many hours per day would pet be left alone? \n\u2022  Where is pet kept when left alone? \n\u2022  Where does pet sleep?\n\u2022  Any other pets in the home?  If so, what type?\n\u2022  Provide detailed pictures or video of your fenced yard - entire perimeter including gates and the bottom of the fencing.  Yard must be free of foxtails and fully secured.\n\u2022  Home check may be performed\n\u2022  If \"meet & greet\" is scheduled, all household members, dogs included, must be present\n\nMost of our available dogs can be seen at Pet Food Express in Antioch on Saturdays from 10 AM to 1 PM\n\nOur adoption fee is $300 for Dogs and $350 for puppies (under 6 months).

Sorry, no exceptions.\n\n**\n\nCarly's adoption begins with a Foster-To-Adopt arrangement that continues until she completes Basic and Intermediate Obedience.\n\n**\n\nCarly is beautiful, funny, and very intelligent! She loves humans who are lighthearted and let her know they enjoy her company! She loooves snacks and attention, and is an accomplished fetch artist... she brings the ball or toy right back to us in eager anticipation of more playtime.\n\nCarly needs a playful, friendly, similar-size dog friend who's approximately her age. (Preference will be given to placement opportunities with at least one friendly similar-side playful adult dog - not a senior or a puppy - in the home.)\n\nLike her cousins and her sister, Mina, Carly came from a situation of far too many dogs and not enough resources or attention. She starts out shy with new people, but soon warms up and shows that she is a happy soul who's a delight to know. She is an expert at the \"submissive grin\" (google it, it's a thing!)\n\nCarly is young and needs adult humans who are home most of the time; she cannot be crated for long periods and she plenty of activity. (Preference will be given to adopters who work from home and/or will use doggie daycare.) Carly thinks middle-school aged children are a blast!\n\nIf you believe you may be a match for Carly, please complete our online adoption application.\n\n\"Companion animal\" means, needs at least one other friendly, playful dog that lives full-time in the same household.\n\"Fenced yard\" means, a backyard that is adjacent to and connected with your residence. (It does not mean a nearby fenced area/dog park.)\nGates must have padlocks and thresholds (cement or buried pavers to prevent digging.)\nYard and patio must be free of debris and have room for dogs to run and play *on a lawn and/or in a very shaded area.* Please do not invite us to your home if you have not yet landscaped your yard!\n\"Swimming pool\" means a private, in-ground, year-round pool that is available to the dog daily or multiple times per week.\nWe do not place dogs in situations where there are \"drained\" or empty swimming pools, which are a fall hazard and contribute to the propogation of mosquitos.\nLast and not least, we DO NOT adopt to students as we have found that they often do not know or anticipate where life will take them.\n\nDiscussion about a dog - including scheduling of a home check or other dialogue - cannot occur until we have received your completed adoption application. NO EXCEPTIONS. Thank you!",

Despite everything he has been through, Archie is a loving, sweet, playful, dog who really enjoys going on walks and playing with toys.  He needs to go to a home where there are no dogs or cats and his person has experience as an alpha with large dogs.  He loves to play and will quickly bond with his human. \n When he's on the leash, he's frightened of other dogs he sees.  But, when he's off the leash, he enjoys playing with other dogs.  Archie comes with an hour of free private training.  He would do best in a home where the children are over 15.\n\nArchie is 3 years old, 65 pounds, has been neutered, given shots, dewormed, and deflead.  If you'd like to meet him in La Mesa, email me (NO CALLS), and I'll email you an application.",

He will need a patient and active family to give him the structure and physical stimulation he needs. Benji is eager to please and food motivated and should pick up commands easily. He does well with most dogs after a proper introduction. However, he can be a little overzealous with play and will need an equally patient doggie friend. Benji would be best with older dog savvy children. We are unsure of how he would do in a home with kitties or other small animals. \n\nBenji will need a refresher in potty training 101 as he has been in a shelter environment for quite some time. We would recommend crate training to help with potty training and keep him out of trouble. \n\nBenji is neutered, up to date in vaccinations and on heartworm and flea preventative, Stop by and meet him, 9-1, Mon thru Sat!",

She is a stubborn girl who does not like any other animals so the abilitly to be able to control her if she sees another animal is key to keeping everyone safe. Some basic training in 'wait' and 'stay' would likely help with that situation. She would do best in a home with a yard where she is able to run around and play. She enjoys the company of children and would love to spend time having them play with her. Rolling in the grass is one of her most favorite things to do. Although animals may not be her thing, she adores people and loves one-on-one attention - you can't beat belly rubs and back scratches! Carmen likes squeaky toys and all kinds of chews. She's not overly active but plays hard for a short time - then sleeps even harder. She likes to have her nap times and would love to have your company while she drifts off to sleep. If you are interested in meeting Carmen, please complete the adoption application (no commitment) found on our website, www.satchelslastresort.org, and an adoption counselor will be in touch with you.",

            "description": "Angus (or Gus for short) is a sweet Boxer mix that was born on October 30, 2018. Gus is a very affectionate boy who knows basic commands and is potty trained. Gus does fine in a kennel but can also be left out as he just likes to sleep when his foster mom is gone. He is great with older kids, adults, and dogs his size (50 pounds). Gus requires exercise and a lot of attention. He is a HUGE snuggler and loves to cuddle in bed and on the couch. Gus would do best in a calm home with a set daily routine. He seems to know his schedule better than his foster mom! Gus has a high prey drive, so NO CATS or small dogs. Gus does suffer from some anxiety and is on a daily medication to help with that. Due to this he also needs someone home more often or q resident dog his size to keep him company. Changes are difficult for him so he would probably need a couple of visits with his adopter to get to know them prior to adoption.\n\nIf you are interested in giving Angus his happily ever after, please fill out an application today!\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Angus is $350, which is TAX\nDEDUCTIBLE, and goes toward providing supportive services to animals in\nthe home, as well as the high cost of vetting our dogs in rescue. If you would\nlike to welcome Angus into your home, please begin by submitting our Adoption\nApplication. The adoptions for all of our dogs will take place in the Omaha,\nNE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship\nor deliver the dogs. If you would like to learn more about Muddy Paws\nSecond Chance Rescue, or donate to our dogs, please visit our website at\nMuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com.

The head wound was from a dog and the leg wound was from a gun shot. We initially thought she would have to have her leg amputated, but she was able to keep it. Then she tested heartworm positive.\n\nJocelyn went through heartworm treatment and spent some time in several different foster homes and is now back at the shelter. Sadly, she has tested positive again for heartworms and will have her first injection after a month of doxycycline. \n\nShe is THE sweetest dog who just wants to cuddle with her people. \n\nJocelyn is looking for an experienced foster who has a quiet house and fenced-in yard where she can go out for short potty breaks during her treatment. She is reactive to other dogs, so a low-traffic neighborhood is best. She is also available for adoption.

He gets along with other dogs, is super friendly with people, and loves to splash around in the water.\n\u2022\nToby has hip dysplasia, and some masses that are (fortunately) only built up keratin. These aren\u2019t painful, and aren\u2019t causing him any issues, they can be removed but it\u2019s purely cosmetic.\n\u2022\nToby is a happy boy and would love a home where he can lounge around and be loved. He doesn\u2019t need an active home, just a happy one.\n\u2022\nFill out an application on our website or email us if you\u2019re interested in adopting this dude.

ARCBCR is a 501(c)3 organization making your donation eligible as a tax deduction. \n\nPLEASE NOTE THAT WE DO NOT DO MEET AND GREETS UNTIL AN APPLICATION HAS BEEN SUBMITTED, PROCESSED AND APPROVED. \n\nAdoption Application: http://www.arcbcr.org/apply-to-adopt/Adoption \n\nThis handsome 3.5 year  guy is Ollie! Also known as Oliver when he is up to no good, which is only a few times a week. True to his aussie self, he is very energetic but loves his down time too. He is very smart, loves swimming, hiking, and jogging. He fears other dogs when he\u2019s on a leash and is reactive if dogs (especially unleashed dogs) or people come running up to him. We have made great improvements on this and he is able to enjoy most of his walks with no issues. His favorite way to get his energy out is by playing frisbee in the yard. He has made plenty of dog friends but they are typically introduced off leash in a yard.\n\n Ollie is very cuddly once he gets his energy out and his favorite seat in the house is typically my lap. He is uncertain of new people and takes a while to warm up. Ollie needs a little time and space to allow him to meet new people on his own terms. Once he warms up to you, all he wants is to be pet!\n\nHe\u2019s interested in what his people are doing and usually wants to be in on the action. He is crate trained and content to hang out in his crate for a few hours if needed. He is not a big chewer and has been left out of the crate in the house for a few hours with no issues.\n\nOllie\u2019s ideal home is with an experienced herding dog owner where he can be given lots of attention or a job (mental stimulation), plenty of physical exercise, large fenced yard with space to run, no small children (older teenagers are okay) and a calm household without a lot of visitors. Ollie would love to have dogs to play with in his new home.\n\nIf you would like more information about Ollie you can email carlsocaro@gmail.com or apply to adopt below\n\n",

Marge is about 1.5 years old, she is great in the house and in a crate. Her favorite thing to do is play fetch. Although she isn't small enough to be considered a lap dog, she feels very differently about that when you sit down.\nMitzi is around 7 months old and is a ball of energy! She loves playing with other dogs. Mitzi is her foster family's shadow and loves to be by their side. Mitzi loves to cuddle and snuggle under the covers at bedtime. Looking to add two loving, playful pups into your home, then look no further! Marge & Mitzi are waiting for you! Apply to adopt these two sweethearts today!! Marge & Mitzi's adoption fee is $350. They are up to date on age appropriate vaccinations, spayed, and microchipped.\nAll of our dogs are spayed or neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccinations, microchipped and if over 6 months of age, heartworm tested and on heartworm preventative in their foster home.\n\nWe require an approved application to meet any of our dogs. We do not have a shelter location and will not arrange a meeting without an approved application.\n\nWe strive to make sure the bios provided for our dogs are complete and accurate; we do understand that mistakes happen, however, so if you absolutely cannot find the answer to your question in the dog's bio, you can contact us for more information.\n\nWe require a home visit for each dog we adopt out, so we adopt within a 2 hour radius of Dayton, OH. If you are outside of this radius, we encourage you to contact your local rescue or shelter.",

            "description": "Are you looking for the champion cuddler? Do you want a super-smart dog who's a total people pleaser? How about the goofiest little pittiepotamus anyone has ever laid eyes on? If you answered 'yes' to any of the above, Hattie may just be the dog for you. Hattie loves people so, so much! Young or old, it doesn't matter to her. She loves to give out her signature Hattie Hugs: placing her front legs on your waist or shoulders and just standing there, soaking in the cuddles. Because of this, she may be too strong for a toddler. Anyone else is just fine! She's very tolerant, and doesn't snap or growl even if you take her favorite toy from right under her nose or hold her on her back like a baby. She's just glad to be included. Hattie is very much a couch dog, but she loves to go sniff around the great outdoors, too. Yeah, she's a bit of a diva, and will dramatically drop to the ground when she gets hot. Don't worry about that, though, because she forgets all about that sass when she's in an interesting environment with new people, dogs, sights, or smells. Speaking of dogs, Hattie would like to be an only dog, please! She's not a huge fan of cats, either- we can't blame her, they just taunt her for being on a leash! Hattie thinks that's just rude. Miss Hattie already knows sit, down, and roll over, and she'd love to show off her tricks to you- or just give you alllll the kisses. Whichever you prefer, she's down either way. Hattie weighs approximately 50 lbs. Click here to view my paperwork.",

Max was a backyard dog, then he was surrendered to a shelter where he was in danger, and now he lives in a boarding kennel. Despite his tough life, Max is a happy guy. He takes just a little time to warm up to new people, and then he is a good friend. He likes being with his person, but he's also fine by himself. He loves tennis balls, watching for squirrels and lizards, hanging out on the couch or in the kitchen, and splashing in any kind of water. \n\nMax needs to be an only pet, and he's such good company, he's the only pet you'll need. He would like a home with a fenced yard, please, and someone who has a soft spot for a senior dog who is ready to retire in comfort.\n\nInterested in adopting or fostering? \n\nPlease fill out our Adoption application: https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/24333/generic\n\nFoster application: https://petstablished.com/foster_form/24332/generic\n\nSomeone will reach out to you ASAP to get the approval process started.",

            "description": "Introducing Colt!\n\nColt was saved from a Craigs List post along with Sally. Colt is a beautiful 70 lb, 2.5-year-old mix with eyes to melt your heart. He loves spending time with people and playing with his toys. He could spend all day napping in bed with you but also loves any opportunity to run around and play fetch! He's housebroken, well-mannered and an extremely gentle pup.\n\nColt does well with other dogs and cats, and he loves kids. He seems to be a little slow warming up to men, but once he gets used to you and you give him some love, then you'll be best friends! Just spend five minutes with him and you're guaranteed to fall in love with his sweet smile and goofy personality. Before coming to Heidi's Legacy, Colt and another dog were found in inhospitable conditions, which lead to some hair loss along his lower back.

He has slowly warmed up over time.  He will come to us if we are sitting and sit by us to be petted or scratched.  He will cautiously come to you for treats.  He runs into his crate at night for his bedtime milk bone.  He is housebroken, but access to the outside is almost always available.  He does wake up very early (pre dawn).  Taking pictures of him is tough as he is always on the move.  Right now is doesn't do well on a leash, but we are working on that. He would do well in an understanding and patient household, with access to a yard, and at least one other social dog.\n\nTo adopt please apply online at foac.us",

            "description": "Nora was captured in a live animal trap set out to catch another dog in the area who was injured in July of 2020. We estimate she was born in February of 2019.   She came into rescue unsocialized, scared and emaciated when she was found in a rural area.   Nora does best with male dogs.  She loves to romp,  play and run with them.  She is unproven with cats. She has grown to love human attention, and seeks you out for hugs and loves to give \"the paw.\"  Nora will need to be fed separately from other dogs, she can be food protective, not uncommon in this breed or dogs that were not fed on a regular basis.  We recommend obedience training for all newly adopted pyrs, to help you create a special bond with you and your new friend, and so you have a well behaved canine. Great Pyrenees are willing to learn, but are no t as eager to comply with commands as much as other breeds. They are bred to be independent thinkers. Applicants must be over 25, own their own home and all children in household must be over 12 years old. Your resident pets must be up to date on vaccines, sterilized, you must have a good history of vet care for them, and you must have used heartworm preventative year round for your dogs. \n\n\nNora will be placed as an inside pet with outside privileges. You MUST have a securely fenced yard accessible from your home. Invisible fencing does not work with this breed and they will take the shock for the freedom.  Great Pyrenees are bred to roam and will create their own territory if not secured, which can led to them being lost, hit by vehicles or shot by people who see them as a threat. The breed is not a good off leash dog, and cannot be trusted to not run away.  A Great Pyrenees off leash is a \" DisAPyr.\" \n\nIf you are interested in adopting or fostering, please complete the appropriate application on our website, www.igpr.org under the Adopt tab. \n\nAll of our dogs marked as needing foster homes are also available for adoption.  If a dog is listed on this site, it is available.  No need to contact us to see if it is,  We do require you  complete the adoption application prior to meeting a dog.\n\nWe also offer a foster to adopt program. You foster the dog, and have first right of refusal on them if an approved application is submitted for them. \n\nIn fostering a dog, the dog comes to you fully vetted. and groomed. You provide good quality food, grooming, and we provide the heartworm preventative and medical care, if needed* .(*Based on approval from IGPR.)\n\nAdoption fee is $350",

            "description": "Vinny is the classic example of \"gentle giant.\"  This sweet boy weighs in at 77 pounds, and if invited, would love to be a lap dog!  \n\nAlthough he was a stray, Vinny has quickly claimed the hearts of staff and volunteers with his even temperament and happy disposition.  In the yard, he will chase toys (although he doesn't return them yet), lean in for a quick pet, or investigate new scents.  His favorite thing, though is take a quick dip in the baby pool or stand under the hose,  Vinny has good leash skills and is building his stamina for longer walks. Although Vinny is very social and enjoys people he is a loyal companion, therefore a single adult home would be best. \n\nDue to Covid, the shelter is  has an appointment only policy. We ask potential adopters to fill out our application, prior to a scheduled meeting. The staff is very accommodating and we welcome any inquires. \n\nThis link will take you to our adoption application.  \nhttps://capemaycountynj.gov/DocumentCenter/View/5814/Adoption-Application",

Here is their video (more to come):\nhttps://youtu.be/cpKqn2dtsxU\n\nRachel is 2 years old (to be verified) (approx. DOB 6-17-18), female, 54 lbs., vetted, is or will be spayed, and micro-chipped.\n\nTonya we believe is also about 2 years old (to be verified) (approx. DOB 6-17-18), female, 60 lbs., vetted, is or will be spayed, and micro-chipped.\n\nRachel and Tonya were found homeless after being dumped off in a rural heavily wooded area. They were loaded with ticks and had porcupine quills around their mouth. they would do best in a home with a yard and outside of a City environment (no apartments please). They are being fostered in a more rural area and have been doing very well. Rachel and Tonya's ideal home is one that is active and experienced to help them with training, they are both very smart. No cats as they do demonstrate a prey drive and a home without very young children would be ideal as they do jump. A secure fenced in yard would be ideal as these girls love to run and play! Stay tuned for more information as Rachel and Tonya are a new rescues!\n\nIf you are interested in fostering or adopting Rachel and Tonya please fill out an Application at www.Passion-4-Paws.org (please make sure you have the Vermont site not CT) - thanks!\n\nPlease note Fosters have 1st option of Adoption.\n\nCheck out their Facebook page (please \"Like\" us while you are there)!\n\nDisclosure:\n\nBreed labels are often incorrect: we rarely know the genetic lineage of the dogs we rescue. Many shelters and rescues specify breeds based on appearance; however, research has shown that less than 2% of a dog's DNA determines appearance!\n\nPassion 4 Paws does not practice the use of labels pertaining to compatibility with others or dog breed. Labels such as \"dog friendly\" and \"child friendly\" should be used with caution as they often over-simplify the personalities and behavior of dogs.",

Thank you.\n\nDany and Catelyn are a bonded mother/daughter pair that we rescued from a hoarding situation in May 2019. It's been a long journey for these two, but they are ready to go to a forever home that will continue building their trust and confidence.\n\nDany is our beautiful merle mama dog. She continues to be shy and timid, but now walks on a leash and will allow you to pet and brush her. She is just the sweetest girl, and we want her to have a safe, loving forever home.\n\nCatelyn is a little spitfire. She is wicked smart, very curious, loves to play in the water and is an excellent escape artist. She's playful and loves going on walks with Dany. This girl will bring lots of joy and laughter to your life.\n\nThese two absolutely must have a securely fenced yard to run and play in. They will run if they escape. They need a quiet home with no other dogs, no cats and no children. \n\nOur dogs are fed a nutrient rich dog food named NutriSource.  Our experience is a high quality dog food keeps vet bills down and well-being high.\n\nIf you have any questions please email: claudiaatwag@gmail.com\n\nVisit our website to fill out an Adoption Application  http://www.wagsequimwa.com\n\nAdoption donation fee $500 for the pair. (Please understand this adoption donation goes towards helping all the dogs we rescue)",

Unfortunately, we do not know much about his history before this family, but come to find out he is very scared and fearful of men and does not do well with young children.  He does have anxiety and needs a calm family with a large yard that he can run around on.  His current family loves him so much but wants a home where he is not stressed and where he can put on weight and thrive.  Can you offer him a forever home? \n For more information please contact Brooke at abhuggins12696@gmail.com </p>\n\n<p><b>This dog is not an official Animal Adoption League dog.

            "description": "Spot is a beautiful 2 1/2 year old pitt/heeler mix.   He weighs approx 50 lbs.   He is a big teddy bear and loves to run and play with other pups and humans.  Spot especially loves kids.  He is kennel and leash trained.  Spot is quiet and funny.  He can also be a bit clumsy and very playful.     Every kid needs a dog named \"Spot\" and it's easy to see where his name comes from.  He's solid white (except for an occasional black \"ticking\" of a cattle dog on his undercoat) but he's got an angel kisson the top of his head that shows up as a black \"Spot\".   He is super cute! . \n\nLike most rescue pups, this furbaby is HW+, but is currently undergoing the *slow-kill method of treatment (see more information below).    All our adoption fees include spay/neuter, micro-chip, up-to-date vaccinations, including rabies thru date of adoption. This pup is heartworm positive and is currently being treated with the *slow kill method, approved by her veterinarian, on prevention & on flea/tick prevention. \n\n*The slow kill method of treatment, simply stated, is a 30 day regiment of  doxycycline followed by a monthly dose of Advantage Multi for 12 months, then retesting.   Most dogs test negative after one year of following this treatment; however, we always recommend that potential adopters consult & follow the advice of their family veterinarian upon adopting any of our hw+ pups.   Although the fast-kill method is still considered the \"gold-standard\" by the AVA, and may be preferred by some vets; the slow-kill method has proven to be effective in our rescue. The main reason we utilize this method is due to our limited financial constraints and the high number of our rescue pups that are infected.   In the cases of severe infection and if the pup is highly symptomatic, we sometimes use the fast-kill approach instead.   Again, we recommend for you to consult with your veterinarian after the adoption is complete and follow their recommendations.   \n\nIn order to be considered for one of our beautiful pups, please go to our website and complete and application: https://www.mustluvdogs.org/adoptable-pets.\nPlease note that we are a DUE DILIGENCE adoption organization. Part of our approval process requires, among other things:\n* Experienced pet home with verifiable vet references/history preferred, but we realize that everyone has to start somewhere, so all applications will be considered.\n*The majority, but not all, of our pets require a fenced yard or secure enclosure.  In the case of apartments, we require Landlord approval and designated dog area in complex.\n*Verifiable good veterinary history INCLUDING regular vaccination/visits and good Heartworm Prevention history is a MUST!\n*Adopter must be able to have time to spend with the pup and be able to provide the pup a safe environment to live.\n*ALL our dogs are expected to be primarily INSIDE dogs.  They MUST sleep inside the home.  We truly understand that some folks have working dogs (i.e. farmers, ranchers,etc); however, the majority of our dogs have had a rough life prior to coming to us & we want to make sure that they are showered with LUV & maybe even a bit spoiled for the rest of their lives. \n\nOther facts are also considered, including whether children or other pets are a good fit with the dog. \n\nMust Luv Dogs reserves the right to deny any applications that we don't think are a good fit with the pup. Our first & foremost concern is the dog's best interest. It is our MISSION to place them in a home that is a great fit for their needs for a lifetime of luv & being part of a family.\n*We will consider adoptions in any area; however, will do not ship or transport puppies under the age of 12 mos. We will ONLY transport an adult dog on a transport approved by MLD, at adopter's expense.\n* In order to be affordable and afford every family an opportunity to have a pup of their own, we keep our Adoption Fees low; however, please keep in mind that the fees we charge do not cover all costs for the pup.  Any additional donations are greatly appreciated!\n\nPlease note that all of our pets are in private foster homes. In order to reduce any stress or confusion for our pups, we require a completed, approved application BEFORE setting up a meet & greet for any of our pups.  Alternatively, you are always welcome to come meet any of our pups at one of our regular Adoption Events.   Our events are always posted on PetFinder OR on our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/mustLUVdogs.org.\n\nFinally, THANK YOU for considering Must Luv Dogs for your next pet. \n\n*Most dogs require a fenced area in yard. \n*Apartments okay IF nearby dog park or walking trails (with landlord appoval).\n*ALL dogs must be INSIDE dogs and treated a part of family. \n*We are a DUE DILIGENCE Adoption Rescue.  \n*Must have good Vet history & Heartworm prevention is a MUST!\n*ALL dogs are fully vetted, spay/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption.\n\n",

            "description": "Juno is amazing.  She loves to sunbathe and absolutely LIVES for her daily walks. She's such a sweet, good girl and loves giving kisses and getting belly rubs. She's so loyal and would truly make the best one-on-one or two-on-one companion. She has some anxiety when she is in chaotic, busy environments where there is a lot going on and gets nervous when she feels surrounded or overwhelmed, and loud noises tend to scare her.  But when she\u2019s at home, all of that goes away.\n \nJuno has had some fear aggression with other dogs, and so she needs to be the only animal in the home. She shared a home and played well with other dogs for 6 years and there were no majors incidents, but there was a fairly bad situation last year that led to her needing to be separated from her four-legged brother, and while she is being cared for where she's at now, she is not getting the love she truly deserves. Because it's unclear what caused the issue, she needs to be the only dog in the home for everyone's safety. She has never shown aggression towards a human, but given her anxiety and the fact that kids tend to do the unexpected :), it would be better if she is not in a home with children either.\n \nJuno is so loving and low-maintenance. She's not all that interested in toys and doesn't have the need for constant attention (though she'll take it if you're giving it!). She's happy just being able to run around outside and chase squirrels. She also loves to just lean on you and be petted for hours if you want her to, especially if you rub her belly! She's great on a leash, knows basic commands like sit, paw, lay down, come (usually lol) and is super smart. She is house broken and is fine being left alone loose in the house. The ideal home for Juno is one with one or two adults who live a low-key life, have the time and energy to take her on walks most days, and really just want a four-legged companion to have as their family.\n\n",

His rescuer talked to Konan and explained to him that she was there to help him, and his journey to happier days began! With his foster's care, Konan has become an independent and easy-going boy. A protector of his home and family, he really enjoys human company. Konan is crate trained but enjoys sleeping in a warm comfy bed much better! He is a happy go lucky boy that enjoys walks and snacks. He is super food motivated and loves to please so training will be an awesome and fun bonding experience between him and his new family. Konan deserves a family who will take the time to help him feel loved and will give him quality time. He would do best in calm and quiet home, with a family who has lots of gentle love to give this good sweet boy to help him live his best life.",

As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble.

            "description": "This girl with the loveliest smile is our precious Cake, and she is looking for a furever family of her own. This gorgeous Pyr girl specializes in cuddling, and she even comes with the softest fur that is pyrfect for snuggling! Cake is a very polite girl, she takes treats ever so delicately that it is adorable to watch. Although Cake gets along well with other dogs, we think this beautiful girl will also thrive as an only dog where she can take things at her own pace, and enjoy all the love her people can give. Her favorite activities are hanging out with her favorite people, and going on walks around the neighborhood. Cake is a rather shy girl, and she is very cautious about new people. However, if you are patient during your first few weeks in her new home by giving her the time and space to process things on her own terms, you will be surprised by the lovely transformation. Once she gets to know and trust you, she is the most affectionate, loyal, and loving pooch you have ever met!  As long as you are willing to spend some quality time with her every day, she is rather content with chilling indoors with you as you work, or binge on your TV shows. She would do best in a lower-activity environment, so we are recommending a child-free home. Cake will be pyrfect for a patient family who will have time to dote on her and let this girl be an essential part of their family.\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nView full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed. \n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

            "description": "Ciki is a female white Bull Terrier. She is 6 years old and she weighs 60 pounds. Ciki is spayed and vaccinated including rabies. She tested light heartworm positive and is undergoing the slow-kill method of treatment using heartworm prevention medication. She has had a Proheart shot to provide 6 more months of treatment. She is ready for adoption. \n\nCiki is sweet girl who loves her people...all of them. She is dog friendly with easy-going dog companions. She has lived with dogs as small as 10 lbs and as large as 80 lbs...temperament is the key and we would want her to meet potential canine family members prior to adoption. Ciki is aggressive about dogs she can hear but not see and dogs she meets when leashed or across a fence. She also should not be around livestock. Ciki needs a strong handler when out and about. But in the home she is a cool cookie and enjoys her family. Ciki is crate, potty and leash trained (with the note above). Ciki also enjoys car rides. \n\nCiki was with us last year and was adopted in the fall, living happily in a new home for several months. Ciki had to return to us due to problems in the home unrelated to Ciki but meaning it was no longer the right home for her. We know quite a bit about her and what kind of home she needs. \n\nAdoption fee is $250. All adoption fees are nonrefundable.  Must apply: Application for adoption is located at http://fs19.formsite.com/JeffTarpleyRescue/application/index.html\n\nJeff Tarpley Rescue, Inc.\n903-490-2959\n\nFind us on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/jefftarpleyrescue/",

It will take a very special and patient adopter for this boy but each step you see toward a more confident dog is so rewarding. It just takes time and we have to go at their schedule and not force it.\n\nHe is 3 years old, 10 lbs and has the cutest underbite. He came from a hoarding situation with 60-70 dogs on a property in Weatherford Texas. His momma passed away and the family dumped all the dogs at the shelter. He had never been in a home much less touched by a human. He was very scared with no self-confidence. \n\nNo worries Jagger! You're safe and loved! \n\nAll Dallas DogRRR adoptable pets are spayed or neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines upon finalizing adoption. The standard minimum donation for puppies is $325 + 8.25% tax = $351.81, for dogs over 12 months the adoption fee is $225 + 8.25% tax = $243.66 and for our senior dogs 8 years and up is $100 + 8.25% tax = $108.25; this increase includes sales tax recently required by the State of Texas to collect.

He has a condition from birth, so he's a little uncoordinated and lacks some cognitive and social skills - so he has a hard time understanding that mouthiness/light biting on you does not equal love (not hurtful). But with the right parent who has time to love him and work on his quirks - he's going to be the perfect dog.\n\nThis boy needs a special person with a special heart. He is believed to have cerebellar hypoplasia, which is a disease that effects how the cerebellum develops. Which means he doesn't have good depth perception and stumbles some. He is a love bug who has no idea he doesn't walk or run quite like the other dogs - and we are not going to tell him! He is a smart and silly boy with a heart of gold. \n\nClint is a loyal companion who loves to snuggle next to his person. He is a happy, playful pup and we can't get enough of him! He loves being part of a pack and would love a canine friend in his furever home - a confident dog that can show him the ropes would be good. He likes to be involved in any fun going on and when we are inside he wants to follow you around. \n\nHe is an Anatolian Shepard who loves water, people, other pups and squeaky toys! He weighs around 55 pounds. He is still a puppy and is learning the ropes of the big boys but still needs a little training but he is 100% worth it and is still a lap dog! \n\nTreatment for him is TLC with an emphasis on L. He is not in pain. He will always be like this and that's what makes him the special boy he is. \n\nAll Dallas DogRRR adoptable pets are spayed or neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines upon finalizing adoption.

            "description": "Hello -  My name's Bernie.   I am about four years old and kind of a rolly polly pit bull.  I'm a lot of fun and have a big fan club, including the rescue where I was raised, the staff and volunteers at Sammie's Friends and even the Animal Control Officers are on my fan club list.\n\nI do have a past, however, that I need to fully disclose and hope that you will love me anyway, as my fan club does.  Here goes I was raised at a rescue and got along with everyone, the other dogs, chickens and other farm animals.  I swam in a pond for hours and life was good.   Then I got adopted by a fairly irresponsible person who taught me nothing and let me run wild.  I got into trouble.  On one of my escapades I attacked another dog.  That dog was injured (not too severely) and had to go to the vet.  I shouldn't have done that.   Animal Control came to my rescue and brought me to the shelter where I could get the education and love and care that I needed.  Here's the rap - When you attack another dog you get the label \"Potentially Dangerous Dog\".   For three years my owner has to meet certain requirements.  It's not as onerous as it sounds.  Don't let this scare you off.   When you come to the shelter to meet me ask a staff member for full details on what is required. \n\nWhile I was once good with other dogs, I am not these days.  There is one very mild mannered dog that I have been O.K. with.  I am very loving to humans and would make someone a great companion.   I am not a high energy dog and do not require a huge amount of exercise.   I'm looking for a not high energy person, who is dog savvy and wants a pal to love and watch TV with. \n\nI am neutered, micro-chipped, UTD on shots.  Come meet me and give me a try.   I know, and so does my fan club, that the right person has to come along that will see that my winning qualities outweigh my past problems.\n\nLove you all,   \n\nBernie",

She has her sit and down commands down as you can see in the video. She needs help socializing appropriately with other dogs, so at this time we think she would do best as an only dog. \n\nClaire is young at almost 2 years old and is 46 pounds.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Claire please fill out an adoption application on our website, wimberleywagrescue.org, and someone will contact you.\n\nAdoption fee is $185.\n\nThank you!",

Email fortleavenworthstrayfacility@gmail.com for an adoption application.\n\nAxle was relinquished in summer 2020 because he did not get along with the family's other dog. We aren't sure if he doesn't get along with most dogs or if that was a fluke, but we do know he is great with people. He was adopted shortly after arriving with us, but now he's back again to find a better match.\n\nFriendly guy, pretty submissive, starts off a little shy but is soon eager to make friends with new people. Axle has been doing great on walks with volunteers and loves playtime in the yard. He knows basic commands, comes when called, kennels up beautifully, etc. He rides like a polite gentleman in the car and enjoys going on adventures. \n\nHe's pretty darn awesome, but he'd probably do best:\n-- with a dog savvy owner to continue his training and exercise, someone who can help him in situations where he is uncomfortable to ensure a good outcome and continued improvement\n-- in a home with no kids or older kids (he was startled from sleep in his last home by a little human and he nipped at the kiddo, but he enjoys playing with kids and might do OK with older, respectful kids who left him alone when sleeping)\n-- as an only pet or with pets he \"chooses\" or is carefully worked into the mix with. We are told he fought with the chihuahua-like dog at his former home and that he has a fear of cats as well. We are still learning about him but haven't witnessed these issues to the extent that living as an only pet is an absolute requirement for him.\n\nBonus tidbits: \n-- He has extra dew claws on his back feet, so he's got a little bit of Anatolian shepherd, Norwegian lundehund or some other breed in his makeup that is known for that trait.\n-- He talks! If he wants you to throw his toy \"One More Time!\" he'll do his best hound-dog-like impression of the expression. \n-- He's a great retriever and can sometimes even catch a tossed toy in the air before it hits the ground.\n\nThe facility is currently closed but we are still accepting adoption applications and making appointments for pre-approved adopters. For an adoption application, email fortleavenworthstrayfacility@gmail.com. Thanks!\n\nFeatured as the Pet of the Week in the July 9, 2020, and July 23, 2020, issues of the Fort Leavenworth Lamp.\n\nAdopted August 2020 but returned January 2021 to find a better match.\n",

The original incident happened when they had moved into a new home and Daisy was over excited/stressed and a delivery man came to the door. Her mom attempted to put her into a crate and she resisted and jumped up alligator-style. We are committed to help Daisy even though we understand she may never find a forever home. For the present time being, we are her family and are continuing to try to help her make progress. We will accept applications from exceptional families who have dealt with similar dogs in the past successfully. Daisy needs to be an only pet and although she was fine with the children in her home, because of the bite she needs to be in an adult only home! If you would like to love Daisy from afar, please visit out website and use the PayPal link to support us in her care. www.CompAnimals.org. Thank you!",

We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ.

He tends to still think he is a tiny little puppy and loves to climb all over you and give you kisses.All he needs to get him to him going is a tiny attention and he is all over you. He loves belly rubs and to play with toys. They usually don\u2019t last with him, as he chews through all his toys. But he has lots of fun while the last. He does not like to play fetch, instead he likes to be chased. He likes to show you a toy so you can try and take it from him. He is potty trained but if he has to go he will go inside occasionally. Before he went blind he was over protective with me and did not do well with other dogs. But since he can no longer see I haven\u2019t noticed the same. He tends to do well with kids, so long as they do not hurt him.\n\nDaisy (the black one) is a female. Shes a total princess, she is sassy, loyal, spoiled and always ends up getting what she wants. In her eyes all stuffed animals and toys/balls are hers. She loves to play fetch, she could play fetch all day if possible, never gets tired. She loves car rides, to eat meat and lay in bed under the blankets where she is most cozy. She is potty trained and would never go inside. She is as loyal as a dog can get, she has never so much growled at me. Such a good girl, but is not good with little kids or other dogs. (Until they play fetch with her) Once she knows you and is familiar with you, she is very loyal.\n\nBoth are 6 years old spayed/neutered. All of their shots are up to date. During their entire lifetime they have lived indoors, and have never gone an entire day outside, so they are Not outside dogs.\n\nI mostly speak Spanish to them so technically they speak Spanish.",

Tucker is estimated to be 7 years old, is fully vetted, neutered and microchipped. He absolutely loves people.\n\nTucker is currently being fostered in Summerville, SC. While Tucker is wonderful with all people, he is not a fan of other dogs or cats and will need a home without other animals. He absolutely loves being outside and running, and will need a fenced yard.\n\nTucker can't wait to find his perfect hooman to call his own. He is extremely sweet and deserves a wonderful life! He is very chill, and absolutely adores love and attention from his people.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Tucker, please visit the Adoption Process page on our website \u2013 http://carolinasrescue.com/Adoption_Process.html. You can download our Adoption Questionnaire there, then email it to us at adoptions@carolinasrescue.com. That will start the process.",

            "description": "We couldn't think of a more fitting name for Twister because once you befriend him, you'll get caught up in a whirlwind of love! If you're a solo person looking for an awesome companion, Twister is your man. This sweet boy will happily sit quietly by your side and lend a listening ear. It's hard not to fall in love when you look into those soulful brown eyes that say, 'Come sit down with me and tell me all about your day.' Want to play? Well, Twister is a puppy at heart! His joy is contagious when he's chasing after balls or playing tug with his rope toy. He is always up for fun and games, and he will sweep you up into a spin of laughs for years to come. While he has great leash manners, Twister prefers to stay in and play as he has a chronic, non-contagious skin condition that flares up with too much exposure to the great outdoors. His foster mom says he looooooves playing brain games and is happy as a clam entertaining himself with puzzles. Plus, he's well-mannered in the house and crate-trained to boot! A gentle soul, and a quiet companion, Twister is happiest in a home with just one best friend. He also wants to be the only animal in the home. He's the kind of guy that you can pour your heart out to - and he really listens. He's super easy to have in the home, and everyone says the same thing about him.... 'He's just so sweet'! Twister is loved by all at APA!, and we are waiting for his one true friend to come along and scoop him up. With his outstanding obedience skills and those heart-melting eyes, he will quickly find his way into your heart and fill it up. Twister enjoys learning new things (as long as there are snacks involved) and is in the Total Obedience Program. Check out a video on APA's CGC program to learn more: https://vimeo.com/89434193.

This boy has been through a lot of neglect before being rescued. However has gotten a lot of care and is on the road to excellence. He loves to play fetch and runs at the speed of light! He has the cutest biggest paws to help get that speed going. Jaycob is very curious and loves to explore with his person close. He is cautious of his surroundings until he gets comfortable. He loves to be pet and enjoys hugs, and kisses. Jaycob is known to get along well with other big dogs, we aren't positive about small dogs yet. But something tells me he would be just fine,. \nFrom Jaycobs Foster Family: I believe Jaycob would do well with an energetic family or couple, he's been great with my teenage boys. All he needs is some love and TLC and you'll have yourself one amazing dog. P.S He's a great watch dog. He loves to sit in the windows and inspect what is going on out there:) Please give this boy a chance. He is waiting patiently for his forever family.",

We pulled him because we believed he had an upper respiratory infection, but we later learned it was actually Distemper! Griffin was rendered immobile from having distemper and has been working to regain mobility in his back legs for a few months! He is now close to being able to walk on his own due to water therapy and exercising in his foster home! Griffin is neutered, up to date on all age appropriate vaccinations, preventatives, and he's microchipped. \n\nGriffin is crate trained and potty trained. He does well on and off leash and rides happily in the car.\n\nGriffin is friendly with dogs of all sizes, genders, and ages! He likes to use his front paws to bat and joust with his foster siblings. Griffin hasn't been around cats or children, but with slow introductions he could do well with them.\n\nGriffin is a playful and friendly lab! He is on the smaller side with being under 50lbs, but he makes up for it in personality! He loves to sunbathe on the patio with his foster siblings and snuggle up on the couch with everyone for a good movie night! Griffin will need continued exercise to maintain the muscles and strength in his hind legs. Griffin will make a great addition to any family!",

He is great with other dogs and loves everyone he meets.  He needs a farm to call his own, or a family that has other dogs and a huge fenced in yard.  He was not happy living without a fenced in yard and other dogs to play with.  He is very housebroken, leash trained and crate trained too.  He is very affectionate and spoiled.  He's used to the good life and needs the right family to come along and fall in love with him.\n\nHe is heartworm negative, has been dewormed, had all of his vaccinations for the year, is neutered, and on monthly heartworm and flea prevention.   His adoption fee is $200.00.\n\nIf you're interested in adopting, please send us a completed dog adoption application back to us digitally:\n\nhttp://jenniferspetrescue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CanineAdoption.pdf\n\nWe go in the order in which we received completed (and approved) adoption applications and not by Petfinder inquiries.  Once your application has been approved, then we will answer any questions you may have.  Also you must be LOCAL to Dallas, GA; within an hour or so to adopt from us.  We apologize in advance, but we just don\u2019t have the resources to get back to every single person that inquires to adopt from us during COVID-19, but know that we do try.  You\u2019ll hear from us ASAP if you are picked to adopt!\n\nP.S.\tPetsmart adoptions are a thing of the past for now, so no we will not be there this weekend.  All adoptions are done by appt. only now in Dallas, GA and if you see this animal listed on Petfinder, then YES he or she is still available for adoption.\n",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Meet Johnny Cash, the singing dog! He bursts into song on a whim, out of the blue. If you sing, he will raise his head way up and join you in his best opera voice. Impress your friends on a group call! He also sings to his favorite music on tv or radio. He is selective about his song choices, but once he starts, he might give you an entire concert. It's hilarious!\n\nThis baby-faced sweetheart wants nothing more than to be adored and loved by you. He is a happy, affectionate boy.\n\nWhen sweet Johnny was born in early 2014, he had a genetic defect with femurs that are bowed and twisted, giving his knees an awkward angle and giving him a wonky stance where he walks on his tippy-toes. Unfortunately, there is nothing that can be done to fix this, but it doesn't slow him down. He can climb steps and get up on the couch or in to the recliner with no problems.\n\nJohnny is a good-sized boy at 95 pounds. He needs to keep his weight there or a little less, so he can remain agile. He still likes to play!\n\nJohnny needs to be the only dog in his family. Placing him with other dogs could lead to disaster. When other dogs near him get up to move, he jumps up and growls at them. Maybe he feels compromised by his unstable legs and is afraid of being hurt; he goes on offense. He is equally uncomfortable around dogs in day care.\n\nHe is totally fine with cats.\n\nHe hopes for people who spend most of their time at home with him. He is a homebody - happiest being cozy with his people and taking an occasional romp around the yard. He wants to be included in everything you do.\n\nHe needs help getting into a car, but he is a fantastic rider! He is house trained and crate trained.\n\nThe only thing Johnny asks of you is if you will please run the vacuum cleaner while he is outside for the moment? That wild contraption is the scariest thing in the world!\n\nPeople in the home should always be aware that his balance isn't the best, so they shouldn't lean on him or rough-house with him. If there are children in the home, they should be old enough to understand how to be polite with him.\n\nJohnny really is a pleasure to have around. Who can resist a singing dog? Karaoke anyone? Duet with your best buddy?\n\nSPIN Pyrs are all in foster homes in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. Potential adopters are asked to make travel arrangements if they live elsewhere. All SPIN dogs are spayed or neutered, current on vaccinations and on heartworm prevention. Please go to our website www.SpinRescue.org and fill out an application for this great Great Pyrenees!",

She is especially fearful of men so it takes her a lot longer to open up to them. \n\nShe is great with other dogs in the home and does need another dog.  She still has some minor leash aggression.  Muffin is not house trained but is working on it, so needs someone around often to continue working with her. \n\nShe does bond very quickly to her person and will bark to get your attention. She is not too fond of her crate, but goes in without a fuss and once she's in she settles down and doesn't make a peep. \n She knows basic commands like \"sit and \"stay\".   She loves to play fetch and will be good in a home with older kids.  She'll make a great family dog.\n\nIf you are not ready to adopt just yet and would like to help in other ways, please consider clicking on the green \u201cSponsor Me\u201d button above to help this dog receive the best care we can give. We rely on the generosity of others to make rescuing dogs possible.\n\nIF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING THIS DOG, PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU HAVE READ THE DOG'S INFORMATION CAREFULLY.  ONCE YOU HAVE DONE SO, PLEASE DO THE FOLLOWING:\n1.       Visit www.dogswithoutborders.org\n2.

            "description": "Rescue date 6/15/17 SHELBY is a cute little PUREBRED Chihuahua who is about 4 years. old and weighs 9 lbs. She was one of several dogs who were rescued from the backyard of someone who was unable to provide them with proper care. She loves other dogs but is a bit on the unsure side when interacting with humans. She's a sweet girl who just needs to continue working on building her confidence. She is best suited for a quiet adult family in which someone can be with her throughout most of the day. Having a well-adjusted companion dog to follow and learn from would be extremely helpful to her as well. She just needs someone to believe in her and help her to blossom into the happy, confident little fur-kid who she deserves to be. The Adoption Fee for SHELBY is $225 and includes spay, up-to-date vaccines, and microchip with registration. Please NOTE that she is AVAILABLE for ADOPTION in CA ONLY! Please understand also that we are a non-profit organization that operates on a small number of volunteers. We are, therefore, UNABLE to ACCEPT PHONE CALLS at this time. If you'd like more information about SHELBY, please send an EMAIL to us at www.saveasmalldogrescue@gmail.com. To submit an online ADOPTION APPLICATION, please go to the SASDR website at www.saveasmalldogrescue.org. We receive numerous applications. If you are among the finalists in the selection process for SHELBY, you will be contacted by phone from SASDR for a phone visit. If you are not available at the time of our call, we will leave a message that includes a time at which we will try later to reach you. SASDR is located in Phelan, CA (San Bernardino County in southern CA). ThanksWe are located in the High Desert, Phelan, next to Victorville and Hesperia.",
