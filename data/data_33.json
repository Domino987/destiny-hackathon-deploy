            "description": "Sophie is a sophisticated girl who enjoys the finer things in life; like car rides around the city and napping on fluffy blankets. Sophie is about four years old and found in a shelter. She was optimistic at first, smiling in all her photos and played nicely in play groups - however, the longer she was at the shelter, the more depressed she became. When rescue found her, she stopped smiling and had gained weight from laying around eating her feelings (dog biscuits). Sophie immediately bounced back to her sparkling smiling self when she met her foster mom and moved into her downtown apartment life. Sophie has thrived as an urban dog; leash trained and friendly with all people. She is just as happy watching life from the balcony as she is, walking along the streets. Sophies favorite thing is cuddling - second is dessert time! (...Sophie last weighted in at 80 lbs so she is strong and pulls a little when exctied) \n\nSophie likes other dogs and plays briefly with dogs she's met. She mostly sniffs then ignores them. Sophie loves kids and gives gentle kisses, not jumping or knocking into them. Sophie is good for movies on the couch or brunch dates downtown. If you are seeking a stylish, sophisticated lady to join your life - this is your new bestie! Curvy is beautiful and Sophie would prefer to maintain her figure as is (girl can eat!). Sophie's ideal family would get her a bling collar and proudly show off this social, gentle and gorgeous blue American Pitbull Terrier.\n\nShe is up to date on vaccines according to her age, she has received proper deworming, and comes with additional dewormer. She is microchipped, spayed, comes with 6 months of preventatives, one month free trial of pet insurance, all of our animals receive a health certificate (this states a licensed veterinary saw the pet and deemed it healthy for travel, it is not a promise of perfect health.) Our transports are USDA certified and transport is included in adoption fee ($450.00).\n\nShe is currently being fostered in Houston, Tx but will be traveling to the PNW as soon as she finds her perfect home! She's hoping to leave town 02-06-2021 so she can see the snow! \n\nPlease inquire by submitting an application (Application link:) https://petstablished.com/petlover/general_form/30256\n\nAdoption Coordinator: leah@threelittlepittiesrescue.org\n\nPlease go to our website to see more about our rescue and what we do! We are very proud of our hard work in saving as many animals as we can, giving them what they need, and matching them with the right families.",

Emmitt is nervous in a new surrounding at first but warms up to everyone he meets very quickly. He is potty trained so he doesn't need a crate. He loves his foster pups, big and small, and gets along well with his foster kitten. His favorite things to do are go on walks, play with his foster brother, and sit on your lap. He needs to continue his obedience training with his furever home, but he loves training sessions and he catches on very quickly. Emmitt is smart, energetic, loving pup who needs a family who can handle his energy. A fenced yard is a must, and preferably another pup so he can spend his days happily playing. NO Small Children - only older mature children for this guy please!\n\nIf you think he may be the right fit for you, visit www.fluffanimalrescue.org and complete an application to begin the adoption process.",

            "description": "This girl is very friendly with people...all people...but not necessarily good with all other dogs. She would be happy as an only dog or with another dog but the dog must be a calm, neutral, well behaved dog. We think she may be Ok with cats since she grew up with them. \n\nDolly had been under-exercised and over fed in her prior home, so she was overweight prior but we've got her on a proper diet and getting lots of daily exercise, so she now weighs 80 lbs. \n\nHere's info from Dolly's trainer on the type of home that would be a good fit for this dog: \"Quiet type of household. No young kids. She is just too rough. Kids 10 and older ok, but it really depends on the kids. If they are quiet kids it's fine. If it is kids that wrestle all the time it would be too much. She is wonderful with my 12 year old. She gets along well with dogs, but is still learning proper skills, so if there is a dog it needs to be a calm, neutral, well behaved dog. She will also be happy being the only dog. She needs at least an hour long leash walk every day to keep her mind and body calm.\" \n \n\nDolly needs a home with Rottie-owner/ trainer experienced adopters only. We will not adopt her to anyone who hasn't owned one of her breed prior. She means well, but is young & quite boisterous and not for anyone who is passive. She will need to be trained with a kind but firm owner. \n\nDolly is crate trained and house-trained. She's been quite a puller on the leash but with the proper tools, her trainer is working on that. Sadly, she was chained in her prior home which only reinforces pulling behavior on a leash. You'll need to be a strong person to manage her until she is fully trained to walk properly on the leash. We do require that anyone who adopts her will work with our dog trainer/behaviorist from the start. \n \n\nPls apply to adopt only if you have Rottie owning/training experience prior and are willing to work with our trainer. \nWe will not adopt this dog to you if you don't.\n\nThe first step is to fill out our Adoption Application, which doesnt obligate you to adopt but does help us to learn if the home you might offer would be a good fit. \n\n \n\nTo apply to adopt go to: www.pendletonpawswv.com \n\nClick on Heading Available for Adoption\n\nClick on link, this takes u to all our adoptable pets\n\nScroll thru pets to find the pet u want\n\nClick on ADOPT on that pets page \n\nThis is our Adoption Application\n\nFill it out in its entirety, then click SUBMIT to send it to us.",

            "description": "Please note: We are a small rescue and do not have the resources to respond to inquiries. If a dog is on our website, it is still available. We can not arrange meet & greet without an application.\n\nAdoption fees: $450 for dogs 12 months/younger, $400 for dogs 1-2 Yrs,\n$350 for dogs 3-5yrs, and $300 for 6yrs and older\n\nMax joined our pack last week from the Stanislaus Animal Shelter. Max is settling In nicely with his foster mom and dad, Susan and Chris. This is what they had to say about Max.\nMax is a very friendly and active German Shepherd. At 7 years old, he has a very sweet personality and would be great with an active family. He loves his walks and has even started running with his foster dad.\nHe is well behaved indoors (no accidents at all) and doesnt seem interested in chewing shoes or any other items in the house. Max is like a shadow around the house and in the yard, he loves spending time with people.\nChris is working with Max on his leash manners and he has also had the chance to meet some other dogs. Max can get a little exuberant with other dogs, but responds well to direction from his leader and just wants to play.\nMax has met some younger kids (maybe 5 years old) and was friendly and well behaved with them. He is not cat tested. Part of the reason Max is so well behaved is that he came from a home environment and only ended up in the shelter because his owner passed away.\nMax would flourish in an active household where he could get some daily exercise. He is a friendly, well-balanced dog and will make a great companion to a lucky family.\nMax is fully vaccinated and neutered and weighs about 72lbs.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please review our adoption process and then fill out an online adoption form at https://www.calpaws.org/adopting. Experience with obedience training is definitely preferred. We are a small rescue and do not have the resources to respond to inquiries. If a dog is our website, it is still available. We can not arrange meet & greet without an application.\n\nWe are always in need of fosters for the amount of dogs we have coming in. Being a foster is such a rewarding experience. If you are interested please review https://www.calpaws.org/fostering",

            "description": "Do you like long walks? Do you like to spoon when you nap? If so I am the girl for you! My name is Journey. I came to Colorado expecting a litter of puppies. I had 10 healthy babies but they are 8 weeks old now so I am all done being a mom and super happy being a dog. I am a 3 year old pittie and my foster moms say I am such a good girl. I am house broken, know basic commands, and crate trained but I dont need to be crated. I sleep all night in the living room with no accidents and I dont get in to anything! I have no food or toy aggression. I absolutely love people and other dogs. I would be so happy if my forever family has kids and even a furry sibling for me. If you are looking for a girl with a moderate level of energy, enjoys snuggling on the couch, completely trained and lots of life left please consider adopting me.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit our website and complete an adoption application at www.elpasocountycanine.org/available-dogs",

            "description": "Logan is an amazing greyhound weimeraner mix (her sibling Dallas was DNA tested via Embark) with an approximate birthday of 06/30/2019. She is a nervous girl who likely missed out on early social skills that would have helped her function normally in life, but she is joyous and playful and capable of bonding with people if given time. \n\nLogan will require a family who will never leave her outside unattended and if the household fence is lower than 6' or there is no fence, she will always have to be taken out on leash. Because of her propensity for flight in stressful situations, she will never be suitable for any off leash activities. \n\nShe is fine with cats and absolutely loves other dogs. She would thrive in a multi dog household where the other dogs were confident and balanced. She would make an excellent companion for a dog who recently lost their house mate, and would be suitable with most people, including children as long as everyone could accept her shyness. \n\nShe is likely not completely house trained if given ample freedom in the home, but when kept on a normal routine and crated when not interacting with her people, she makes no bathroom mistakes and hasn't pottied her crate a single time. She is working on her leash walking skills and she is learning to snuggle and eat meals on a regular schedule. She loves her crate and is comfortable in it for a full work day as needed. She is too nervous to benefit from obedience training at this time, so we are sticking with the basics. She is currently able to sleep through about half the night in bed before getting restless and needing to be crated. \n\nLogan will likely never be a \"normal dog\", but for a family looking for a loyal and hilarious companion, she would be an excellent choice. She is blossoming and making progress by the day and is a blessing to have around. She comes spayed, vaccinated, microchipped and dewormed. Her adoption fee is $200.00. To apply, visit www.murcismission.org. \n\nThank you for checking out our girl!",

He can be a little timid at times, but he's getting more and more used to being around all the crazy sounds of a human family.\n\nOverall, Balto is a super chill guy, choosing to lay on his favorite couch most of the day, but also loves to play with other dogs and going for walks outside. He is still learning his leash manners though, so he needs someone strong to keep him on track. \n\nBalto is currently undergoing treatment for heartworm.\n\nYou can apply to adopt Balto at https://www.mostlymuttz.org/adoption-application/.",

She is still getting used to the good life and is unsure of certain luxuries (like walking on hardwood floors, couches, beds, etc. but every day is feeling more comfortable) she is housetrained. She will get into things that she can reach and lacks basic manners that I feel she will learn quickly and easily! She would love a big yard to run around in although not necesssry, but enjoys an active lifestyle. \n\nGoldie is so deserving of forever, and any family would be hitting the jackpot with her. \n\nNote: Dog is currently being treated for heartworm disease.",

Sadly she tested Heartworm positive but she will be treated before ei g adopted is why she is only available as a Foster to Adopt right now. Foster to Adopt is a great way to know she is a fit for your family and we supply all of her needs in the process. \nADOPTION FEE: $150.00\n\nAll our adoptable dogs are spayed or neutered, micro-chipped, dewormed, UTD on age appropriate DA2PP & Bordetella Vaccines as well as on Heartworm & Flea Preventatives.\n\n*READ ALL - COVID 19*\n\nWE ARE OPEN BY APPOINTMENT ONLY & MASKS ARE REQUIRED. \n\nOur facility is currently CLOSED TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. \n\nYOU MUST APPLY AND BE APPROVED TO ADOPT TO GET AN APPOINTMENT\n\nAPPLY TO MEET HERE: https://form.jotform.com/202887123155152\n\nApplying does not commit you but rather gives you permission to meet & adopt if you choose to.\n\nONCE APPROVED WE WILL CALL & EMAIL YOU - APPROVALS CAN TAKE A FEW DAYS\n\n** WEEKEND APPLICANTS **\nWE ARE CLOSED SUNDAY & MONDAY THUS YOU WILL NOT HEAR BEFORE TUESDAY\n\nWe realize that you are excited & anxious to know but calling us daily to check keeps us from working on the applications & delays the process. \n\nONLY ONE APPLICATION NEEDED \nIf interested in more than one pup just put all the names on one application.

It is of the utmost importance that our staff stays healthy so our pets can be taken care of. After someone leaves our facility everything is cleaned with bleach water for the safety of all!\n\nAll our pets are posted online and we continue to take applications until they are actually adopted. Many times things change and an approved adopter does not adopt the animal so we do maintain a wait list when necessary. \n\nThank you for reading this and following the directions. It is a part of our approval process!\n\nAPPLY HERE: https://form.jotform.com/202887123155152\n\nADOPTION FEE: $150.00",

She LOVES going on walks but still needs a little work on her leash manners. In her current foster home Miso lives with a 65lbs mixed breed dog that she loves to play with and a small/medium cat. Right now Miso is very curious about the cat but keeps her distance. If you're looking for a spunky and eager to learn fur baby to add to your family Miso is your girl!\n\nIf you are interested in this animal please start by filling out an adoption application at <a href=\"\"http://www.cfp-nc.org/adopt\"\">CFP-NC.org/adopt</a> and we will get in touch with you.",

Please fill out an adoption application today!!!Please read the animal bios completely before requesting additional information as we do our best to answer the most frequently ask questions in these bios. \n\nIn order to adopt one of our animals an application must be submitted and approved. You can find these applications by going to http://humanemorgan.org/index.php?page=adoption \n\nABOUT ADOPTING FROM THE HSMC: \nThe shelter address is 1170 Fairground Rd. Madison, GA 30650. For more information on any of our pets, please feel free to email us at INFO@HUMANEMORGAN.ORG give us a call at 706-343-9977. \nAll dogs are heartworm negative, current on vaccines/dewormings, and microchipped. \nAll cats are FeLv/FIV negative, current on vaccines/dewormings, and microchipped. \nWe are open 10am-5pm Monday-Saturday, we schedule our last adoption at 4pm everyday to allow our staff enough time to feed and walk dogs. \nWe are an animal shelter and therefore are not able to individually potty train our residents. Many adult dogs do arrive \"\"house broken\"\" however due to animal behavior any change in environment will make an emotional impact on the animals and therefore initiate unwanted behaviors during the acclamation period. Please keep this in mind. Puppies do not have the biological maturity to maintain absolute bladder or bowel control and will require a certain degree of potty training and house breaking. Please consider the time and commitment it takes to provide the necessary building blocks for these special babies, prior to submitting your application. \nIf you have any questions please email us at info@humanemorgan.org and provide name of the animal you are interested in, in the subject line. \nThank you, HSMC Staff \n\nADOPTION FEES Adoption Fees may change without notice. Always verify the fee when finalizing the adoption. \n~ Cats and Kittens ~ \n* Under 1 Year = $100 \n* 1-5 Years = $75 \n* Over 5 Years = $50 \n** Purebred cats and kittens may be subject to special pricing \n\n~ Mix Breed Dogs ~ \n* Under 1 Year = $200 \n* 1 -3 Years = $175 \n* 4-8 Years = $150 \n* Over 8 Years = $100\n\n~ Purebred and Designer Breed Dogs ~ \n* Under 1 Year = $375 \n* 1-3 Years = $350 \n* 4-8 Years = $275 \n* Over 8 Years = $150 \n\n~ Medical and Special Needs ~ \nWe have rescued dogs and cats which require additional medical care or that have special needs which are not life threatening.

For more information on any of our pets, please feel free to email us at INFO@HUMANEMORGAN.ORG give us a call at 706-343-9977. \nAll dogs are heartworm negative, current on vaccines/dewormings, and microchipped. \nAll cats are FeLv/FIV negative, current on vaccines/dewormings, and microchipped. \nWe are open 10am-5pm Monday-Saturday, we schedule our last adoption at 4pm everyday to allow our staff enough time to feed and walk dogs. \nWe are an animal shelter and therefore are not able to individually potty train our residents. Many adult dogs do arrive \"\"house broken\"\" however due to animal behavior any change in environment will make an emotional impact on the animals and therefore initiate unwanted behaviors during the acclamation period. Please keep this in mind. Puppies do not have the biological maturity to maintain absolute bladder or bowel control and will require a certain degree of potty training and house breaking. Please consider the time and commitment it takes to provide the necessary building blocks for these special babies, prior to submitting your application. \nIf you have any questions please email us at info@humanemorgan.org and provide name of the animal you are interested in, in the subject line. \nThank you, HSMC Staff \n\nADOPTION FEES Adoption Fees may change without notice. Always verify the fee when finalizing the adoption. \n~ Cats and Kittens ~ \n* Under 1 Year = $100 \n* 1-5 Years = $75 \n* Over 5 Years = $50 \n** Purebred cats and kittens may be subject to special pricing \n\n~ Mix Breed Dogs ~ \n* Under 1 Year = $200 \n* 1 -3 Years = $175 \n* 4-8 Years = $150 \n* Over 8 Years = $100\n\n~ Purebred and Designer Breed Dogs ~ \n* Under 1 Year = $375 \n* 1-3 Years = $350 \n* 4-8 Years = $275 \n* Over 8 Years = $150 \n\n~ Medical and Special Needs ~ \nWe have rescued dogs and cats which require additional medical care or that have special needs which are not life threatening. In these cases we may require a higher fee to help recoup the costs of their care while at our rescue.",

She smiles when you talk to her. \n$30.00 cash adoption fee (includes a microchip).\n\n$80.00 good-faith deposit will be collected at the time of adoption. If paying this fee by check, the check will be cashed. This added spay/neuter step will help stem the tide of animals that end up in shelters, many ultimately facing euthanization. Once sterilization has been completed, take or mail proof of surgery to the Humane Society of Calloway County, 607 Poplar St. (in the Weaks Center), Murray, KY 42071. Your $80.00 deposit will be reimbursed, typically within one week. \n\nPlease visit: murraycallowayanimalshelter.weebly.com to fill out an application.

This handsome boy was adopted shortly after his arrival, but was sadly returned after his adoptive family realized it was too much for them to have a dog on top of 3 kids. They noted he was a great dog who was awesome with the little ones. Quito is an energetic and playful guy who would appreciate regular exercise and stimulation. He would love a home that can take him hiking on the weekends, and allow him to snuggle up to watch TV with his humans at night. He comes housebroken and loves treats. Quito is a little over a year old and weighs around 55 pounds. Fun fact: you may think he is a Husky mix with those eyes, but he was DNA-tested and Husky was not one of the detected breeds! Please apply if you'd like to meet him!To initiate the adoption process for this dog, please complete our online application by clicking below.

I am around a yeah and a half old and believed to be a Boxer mix. I got lost and my owners never came looking for me, so I was taken to a shelter where I was just transferred over to BAHS to help me find a new home! I am super sweet and love everyone I meet. I am good with other dogs, but haven't been around cats or kids quite yet. I need some basic obedience training, but I am very food motivated and would learn quickly. I love to run around and play with toys. Wanna play? \n\nAll dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped and have age appropriate vaccinations.",

If a dog receives multiple applications, we operate on a best-fit basis, not first come first served.***\n\nHi I am Tigre, aka T, aka Mr T\n\nI am a 1 1/2 year Boxer mix. I am up to date on all my shots and I get my heartworm prevention on the 5th of each month. Now that we got all that out of the way let me tell you about myself.\n\nMy girl being only 18 couldn't take care of me a more, I miss her, she dropped me off with my grand-humans. Their house is fun I have 4 fur-cousins to play with and also a bunch of human cousins to play with. I really do love playing with all of them.\n\nI would love to be a lap pup and snuggle with you on the couch. Oh and there's nothing better than snuggling in bed.\nI am house trained and can be left alone although I will get on the couch to sleep if nothing is on it and blocking my way. I do go in my crate to sleep, my bed is very comfy. The door to my crate is always open.\n\nI love my play toys, my rope, tug toy and bones. They are fun to play with.\n\nI love to run and play in the backyard, I have lots of energy but when the time calls for it I am a couch potato. I do need a fenced yard, I have been know to explore the neighborhood from time to time, maybe you can help me with that.\n\nMy grand-humans have spoiled me, they do give me table scraps from time to time and I always get dry food mixed with can food and some water added.\n\nI know they are going to miss me a lot but will be so happy for me when I find just the right forever home that is filled with love and treats. I know it will be a little hard for me too, but I will adapt quickly with lots of hugs and love.\n\nMy perfect home will be a home with children and I don't even mind a new fur brother or sister. Most of all the home needs loves.",

Surprisingly, I never had a family back in Texas until finding a foster family in Colorado. It's so nice! I love having furry foster siblings to hang out with, comfortable blankets to spread out on, and a yard to run around in. I am learning the ropes very quickly! I can now sit on command and am excited to learn more from my loving humans. My foster mom says that I am the most eager-to-please dog in the world. I will listen to whatever you say and will do my best to be a good girl at all times. All I need is love and some good pets. \n\nI am athletic, medium-energy, and a small-medium size. I am a good fit for adventures with a little room in their tent or a family who enjoys walks and has room on their couch. I am learning to play fetch with my furry foster sister. I love all dogs that I meet, big and small. Sometimes humans are a little scary if they're in my yard and I don't recognize them immediately, but I warm up pretty quickly! Just have to make sure my humans know there's an intruder first, then I can ask for all the pets once I meet them.\n\nI am the momma to a beautiful litter of puppies, but now that they are growing up, it's time I find a furever family to call my own!\n\n \n\n \n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

Even though Im no spring chicken, this Puffin still has a ton of pep him his step! Im a totally healthy fella and Ill make sure to get neutered soon. I was recently rescued from Tijuana with the rest of my Artic pals. We migrated our way up to San Diego and life has been un-burr-leavable, but I cant wait to find myself a find my furever flock!\n\nIm a mellow man that gets along with pretty much everyone under the sun. I like other pooches and even cats! Even though Im friendly, I pretty much just leave other furry creatures alone so that I can give all my attention to my hoomans. I would prefer to be the only boy doggo around. Im the ultimate companion who will give you my whole heart! I love kids too, I just need a gentle introduction.\n\nMy favorite place to be is in your lap, but Ill also settle for an elbow, knee, or between your feet. Im an affectionate fella! When Im not being a cuddle bug, Im a pro at fetch. I love tennis balls and chewing on my little squeaky toys too!\n\nIm learning how to be a good boy and have fewer accidents in the house when on a regular walk schedule. Im still working on it, but practice makes pawfect. Im getting better on the leash when Im with other pups because I follow the pack, but when Im alone, Im not quite sure what we are supposed to be doing. Im sure Ill get the hang of it soon!\n\nIf youre looking for a superb snuggler who will be your personal shadow, Im the little man for you. Id do well in a home with or without other pets, but no other male dogs please, and would be fine with kids as long as have a proper introduction. Im an easy-going guy who likes to play, but all-in-all, Im pretty low maintenance! So what do you say? Lets meet today! My adoption fee is $200 and that includes spaying/neutering, shots, and microchip. If you want to take me home, please fill out the form on the website here: https://theanimalpad.org/adoption-application/",

She has some manners just needs some positive reminders from time to time?!\nShe has done well with the dogs she has met and had no reaction to the cats she has seen. She is very playful and does know how to sit and take treats. She prefers to do her business and come right back in. She is very cuddly!! We believe she would do fine with older kids that are steady on their feet!!\n\nAvery was previously Spayed. We have Microchipped her and brought her current on all Vaccines including Rabies. She has been given a dewormer, started on Flea/Tick prevention, Heartworm tested (NEGATIVE) and given Heartworm Prevention.

Little Ivan hid under the car and cried pitifully.  Our volunteers fed, washed, heated.  Ivan received all the vaccinations, grew up, he was brought to us, because in Russia dogs are not needed and they are not spared.  When we met Ivan at the John F. Kennedy airport, a cheerful, active, very gentle and affectionate puppy ran out to meet us.  Ivan is 10 months old.  Ivan is very human-oriented and loves all animals, dogs, cats.  Likes to walk a lot, play with a ball, jump and run.  We are looking for the best family without small children, because Ivan knows how to jump for love.  If you are interested in our Ivan, please send your request to us  by email and we will send you an applications : dsprescue@gmail.com or send the text 347-530-7069.  or 215-264-3704.",

At home, he's a calm, laid-back boy who loves to nap in the grass. Blizzard can be a mouthy boy whose chew toys can include hats and shoes. He would love continued training on redirecting to dog chew toys. He's a very smart fellow who learned 'sit,' 'wait' and 'come' in only two weeks, and is in the process of learning even more commands. Blizzard is looking for an adult only home. He is a very loyal companion, and can be protective of his people. Come meet Blizzard, he would love to show off his floofly fur and be your laid back pup for life!",

            "description": "The only thing this Pirate will steal is your heart! From the moment he jumps in your car, this well-behaved pup will be by your side or keeping you in his sight at all times. When you're working at your desk or in the kitchen, he will always lay close by (or under your chair). He also may sit up and very kindly say 'Hey, it's dinner time'! Pirate is hesitant with new people, but turns into a love bug within a few minutes (especially if you bribe him with treats). This pup is so friendly, and just wants to snuggle all the time. He has calmly hung out with dogs he's seen on walks, just sniffing and nuzzling them. And he's been curious about babies in strollers, but hasn't approached them. Pirate loves carrying his sock monkey from room to room. He would also love to sit on your lap when you're on the floor with him. He has adapted to house-life quite well. When this house-trained boy needs to go out, he just walks to the door and lays down, making a little whining noise if not noticed. In foster, he has slept in his crate every night and is now starting to take naps there during the day, doing well when home alone. He is recovering from a hind leg injury, so he takes medication twice a day and rests in his crate. A smart boy, he responds to his name, 'settle' if he is getting too excited and 'no' and 'lay down'. Pirate would be best suited for adults or families with older children, just because of his size and his desire to be a lap dog. Pirate will be an amazing companion to anyone lucky enough to meet him. Search no further for your treasure, cause this guy is it!",

My previous owner had to go into a nursing home and was unable to take me with her so the RR opened their arms and took me right in to find me another home to spend the rest of my years in. My foster mom doesn\u2019t know anything about my medical history other than I am spayed and my mouth is absolutely horrid.  I am in desperate need for a dental and to get up to date on my vaccines and heartworm test. I also have IVDD so my back and legs are very weak and wobbly. I try to hold my business until I get outside but sometimes can\u2019t. My foster mom is still trying to figure out how extensive my special needs are. We will know more once I am seen by our vets on Thursday (Jan 28). I will need to go to a home that is familiar with Dachshunds with back issues and has lots of patience to help with my potty accidents. I am a super sweet girl, and am very curious about my new surroundings. I follow my foster parents around all over the house, and even get up to a nice little jog out in the yard. Feel free to email my foster mom with any questions you have and she\u2019ll do her best to answer them. I\u2019ll update y\u2019all as soon as I get the all clear from the docs .. Go ahead and send in an application if you think I could make a wonderful addition to your household. Thanks! \n\nIf you want to help with this dog\u2019s medical expenses: \nhttps://therescuedrescuers.org/how-to-help\n\nIf you want to adopt this dog, apply at the link! \nhttps://therescuedrescuers.org/adoption-application",

He has nice manners and a quiet sweetness. He will do well working with a professional trainer to build his confidence and a tighter bond with his new family.\n\nThis sweet sensitive boy longs to please. He loves gentle head scratches, positive reassurance, chewing on antlers, and training sessions with plenty of treats! He is wary of new people, but with love and patience he will become a faithful friend. He has a gentle soul and learns quickly. Spirit is bonded with Blossom.

He is housebroken and\ncrate trained. He's never been around other animals except ferrets,\nand he loves them. He's good with kids, but can knock them down\nin the excitement. He is neutered and up to date on shots.\n\n    If you are interested in adopting Stitch, please go to our website\nat\u00a0www.afobcwv.org, and click on the Adoption Application link.\n    Once we receive your online application, and call your vet for\na reference, we can make an appointment for you to meet him.\n",

            "description": "Animal Profile: Jack is a ~5 year old ~15lb chihuahua/dachshund mix. He was rescued from Fresno, CA after his family could no longer keep him. Once Jack was rescued and joined us, it became clear he never had much exposure outside of his previous home. He was very fearful of people and a leash, but with time, patience, and dedication from his wonderful foster family - he has really flourished into a loving, wonderful companion in their home.\n\nFoster Update:\n\nJack is looking for a special home that has the patience to work with him through his initial fears and suspicions to get to the sweet, loyal, and loving little boy he is underneath. He likes dogs of all sizes (especially small dogs who will play with him) as well as cats, and is looking for a home with other pets and with one or more humans who can spend a lot of time at home with him. In his foster home, Jack enjoys snuggling on the couch with his foster mom (he's a perfectly-sized lap dog), getting ear scratches and belly rubs, playing with stuffed toys, exploring the outdoors, dutifully following his foster mom around the house while she does chores, and cuddling with his dog and cat foster siblings while his foster mom works in her home office. At night, he prefers to sleep under the covers, usually on his foster mom's feet. He will make a loyal and loving companion for the right person, and will likely be the type of dog who attaches hard to one person in a household. He would enjoy a securely-fenced yard that he can explore with his dog siblings, and will thrive in a committed home that continues to work with him to overcome his fears of new people and new situations.\n\nAdoption Info: Adoption fee is $475, which includes spay/neuter, current rabies/DAPPV/bordetella vaccinations, microchip, health certificate, and heartworm test. All adoption fees are donations to a Washington non-profit corporation and all donations go to benefit the animals in our rescue.\n\nApply online at www.DogGoneSeattle.org\n\nAnimal History: This dog was rescued from euthanasia at a high-kill shelter in California and will be available for adoption in Seattle, once evaluated in a loving foster home in the greater Seattle area.",

            "description": "*FOSTER OR ADOPTER NEEDED ASAP*\n\nThis handsome gentleman is Roscoe!  Roscoe is 8 years-young and his family has to move and sadly, can't take this cutie with them.  Roscoe is now in need of a new home and we\u2019re hoping to help him find just that!\n\nRoscoe is very very spoiled.  He prefers to sleep with someone, which he has done since a puppy, but he does have 2 wonderful comfortable beds that he likes and will use if that is necessary.  He snores when he is in deep sleep.  He also enjoys walks and car rides and he likes to play ball and fetch. \n \nHe gives himself a pedicure when his nails get too long.  Roscoe LOVES the water.  He enjoys going swimming in pools and ponds!  He also enjoys digging himself a hole to lay in and sun himself, but he prefers to stay in the a/c!  He loves to lay on a couch and snuggle while humans watch TV, but he doesn't realize he is not a lap dog, since he has always been around small dogs (Chihuahua and Pug).  He is house trained and will always let you know when he needs to go out!\n \nHe loves kids and is very helpful with the kids, if they cry or do something they are not supposed to be doing he will pace or come nudge your hand!  He has been around kids since they were babies, they are now 11 and 4 and he just loves them, but he does need to be careful, as he doesn't realize he is a big dog.  Although he has gotten along with the little dogs, he is getting older and prefers to be the only dog!\n \nHe does seem to have some food sensitivity, but adding in a small amount of pumpkin seems to help.  His current diet is Victor Hi performance, which has helped keep his coat shiny!  So if he needs to change his food, it should be done carefully and slowly!\n\nPlease help us get Roscoe into a safe, loving forever home!  If you're unable to help by adopting, sharing this post or donating is always appreciated.  Don't forget, Passion for Pitties is a 501(c)(3), so all donations are tax-deductible!\u2026every little bit helps!\n \nIf you would like to adopt loving Roscoe, please fill out an application at www.passionforpitties.com under the \u201cAdorable Adoptables\u201d heading.\n",

I was kept outdoors for the 2 years of my life, I was allowed to run in the streets, and didn\u2019t really know what warmth was till 4ever Yours rescued me.  I learnt within a couple of days that there is love and kindness in the world. Now I sleep in the bed with my foster parents and use the dog door to go out. I am no longer cold and I cannot get enough of the attention I get.  I am great with other dogs my size or a little bigger. I am unsure about cats. I would do good with gentle kids.  All I ask for is a fenced yard, good food, warm bed, hugs, kisses, water and a lap.\nIf you would like to adopt me, email 4everyoursrescue@gmail.com\n\nAdoptions only 1 hour driving distance from Sacramento.",

She does enjoying socializing with other dogs but can be skittish when they bark or come at her quickly. Absolutely NO small dogs, cats or small animals in the home.\nHazel has spent months training at Mattox Dog Training and has made a lot of progress with appropriate behavior around humans and canines alike.\nHazel\u2019s new home will require extensive breed knowledge and adults only-NO exceptions\nWe will require potential adopters to meet with her former trainers and learn the commands Hazel is used to responding to.\nHazel will require an owner committed to ongoing training to ensure she remains a good canine citizen.\nHazel will require a home with a secure 6 ft fenced yard, some exceptions may be made depending on experience with the breed.\nHazel has a cautious nature (as the breed typically does) she will do best in a home that can be understanding of this.Hazel is crate trained though she is 100% trustworthy without the crate while alone in the home.\nHazel loves balls and adores water-except if it\u2019s bath time ?\nIf you think Hazel is the perfect match for you, applications can be submitted at www.MikeysChance.com \nAll large and/or active dogs will require a full fenced (6ft) secure yard. \nNo children under 5. \n\nLike all Mikey's Chance dogs, this dog will come to you from a foster home that has provided loving one-on-one attention, socialization and some basic training, as well as quality food and exercise. \n\nApplications can be found at www.mikeyschance.com and completed on a computer, tablet, and/or phone. Please note that adopters are not chosen on a first come, first served basis, but full consideration is given to the best fit for the dog AND the adopter. Applications can take up to 3 weeks to process. Application submission DOES NOT guarantee approval for adoption.",

            "description": "Born September 1, 2020, Rebel is a male American Staffordshire Terrier. Here is what his foster mom says about him: \"Rebel is a gentle soul that is a people pleaser and boy is he smart, he can sit on command and will do anything for a treat. We are working on leash training. He is fully crate trained and can go all night without an accident and will use potty pads if I\u2019m not quick enough to take him out. He love toys and chewy things. He is a typical pitty and plays hard and rough and is extremely vocal which is an endearing quality if you ask me he\u2019s got all the right pitty qualities.\" Rebel's forever home will require a secure 6 foot fence with adults or adults and children over 5. Applications can be accessed at www.mikeyschance.com\n\nAll large and/or active dogs will require a full fenced (6ft) secure yard. \nNo children under 5. \n\nLike all Mikey's Chance dogs, this dog will come to you from a foster home that has provided loving one-on-one attention, socialization and some basic training, as well as quality food and exercise. \n\nApplications can be found at www.mikeyschance.com and completed on a computer, tablet, and/or phone. Please note that adopters are not chosen on a first come, first served basis, but full consideration is given to the best fit for the dog AND the adopter. Applications can take up to 3 weeks to process. Application submission DOES NOT guarantee approval for adoption.",

            "description": "Born August 28, 2020, Dexter is a male Chihuahua seeking a forever home. Dexter has been neutered, chipped, and vaccinated. He's a typical puppy, very active and playful, but also willing to snuggle down if you have a cozy blanket. Dexter currently weighs in at 5 pounds, but don't let his size fool you, he can hang with the pack when running around the backyard. He loves to chase tennis balls and is currently working on his retrieving skills. Dexter currently lives with dogs of all sizes and two kids; he enjoys playing with them all. He is a social pup and would do well with canine siblings. Dexter is still working on potty training but is very treat motivated and uses a doggie door. He sleeps in his crate at night. His foster works at home, so he is rarely home alone but can be trusted in the house during the day. He enjoys a good chew bone and is easily redirected. His forever home will need a secure fence with adults or adults and children over five. Applications can be found at www.mikeyschance.com \n\nNo children under 5. \n\nLike all Mikey's Chance dogs, this dog will come to you from a foster home that has provided loving one-on-one attention, socialization and some basic training, as well as quality food and exercise. \n\nApplications can be found at www.mikeyschance.com and completed on a computer, tablet, and/or phone. Please note that adopters are not chosen on a first come, first served basis, but full consideration is given to the best fit for the dog AND the adopter. Applications can take up to 3 weeks to process. Application submission DOES NOT guarantee approval for adoption.",

            "description": "Born August 28, 2020 Mimi is a female Chihuahua mix seeking her forever home! Mimi is spayed, chipped, and vaccinated; She is the most mild-mannered puppy and would love to snuggle with you and a cozy blanket all day. Mimi currently weighs in just under 5 pounds and is all love. Mimi currently lives with various sized dogs, two kids and gets along well with all of them. Her ideal home would be on the quiet side. She is a bit shy in the beginning but warms up quickly! She is the sweetest little snuggle pup and has a fondness for men. Mimi is still working on potty training but is very treat motivated and uses a doggie door. She sleeps in her crate at night. Her foster parents work at home, so she is rarely home alone but can be trusted in the house during the day. She enjoys a good chew bone and is easily redirected. Her forever home will need a secure fence with adults or adults and children over five. Applications can found at www.mikeyschance.com\n\nNo children under 5. \n\nLike all Mikey's Chance dogs, this dog will come to you from a foster home that has provided loving one-on-one attention, socialization and some basic training, as well as quality food and exercise. \n\nApplications can be found at www.mikeyschance.com and completed on a computer, tablet, and/or phone. Please note that adopters are not chosen on a first come, first served basis, but full consideration is given to the best fit for the dog AND the adopter. Applications can take up to 3 weeks to process. Application submission DOES NOT guarantee approval for adoption.",

            "description": "Pearl is an absolutely delightful and joyful little girl. She's probably around 13 to 14 years old. Because of a thyroid issue she was a little overweight when she arrived at her foster home. With diet and exercise she is now not only looking great, she is able to run and climb steps. She is easy-going, cuddly and entertaining. She has made herself right at home with her foster's three Chihuahuas. She sleeps in a bed in the office, and there is never a peep out of her during the night. She is house-trained, but on rainy days she chooses to use a puddle pad more often than not. She loves the outdoors and foraging for food under the fruit trees. She is a food thief and will not only eat her food, she will attempt to eat the other dogs' food also. Not really an issue with supervision, but mostly fun and entertaining to watch the action unfold. This has improved over time with guidance. One of the most endearing qualities about Pearl is that when she barks, she throws her head back and her front paws leave the ground. Cute as can be. This little girl will make someone a wonderful companion!\nAdoption application at https://www.shelteranimalsrescue.org/adoption.shtmlVisit the SARG, Inc. website for more information about our policies, events, and to submit an online application for one of our animals: https://www.shelteranimalsrescue.org.",

She makes her foster parents laugh on a daily basis with her quirkiness. She uses the doggy door and her potty training is going well. Princess is currently not particularly treat motivated and training new behaviors does take a bit longer with her. However, with consistency she does pick up new behaviors. Her favorite place to be is snuggled up on your lap or right next to you. Princess sleeps in her crate at night and when her humans leave the house. She can be timid and easily scared at times, but she is becoming more confident. Princess is still working on leash training. She gets along with most other dogs however, does not like to be disturbed when she is resting. She will need a securely fenced yard with adults or adults and calmer dog savvy children over 8. Applications can be accessed at www.mikeyschance.com\n\nNo children under 5. \n\nLike all Mikey's Chance dogs, this dog will come to you from a foster home that has provided loving one-on-one attention, socialization and some basic training, as well as quality food and exercise. \n\nApplications can be found at www.mikeyschance.com and completed on a computer, tablet, and/or phone. Please note that adopters are not chosen on a first come, first served basis, but full consideration is given to the best fit for the dog AND the adopter.

            "description": "Hello, my name is Lady (HWTH#21027A).  I am a Lab mix, born on 10/4/2010 and I weigh approximately 45 lbs.  My mother Diamond (adopted), my brother Mufasa (HWTH#21026A), and I were relinquished together to Halfway to Home after our owner passed away.  We are a little overwhelmed after having being taken from the only home we have ever known, but the people here are very nice and are helping us prepare to find new homes to spend our golden years.  I may be a senior, but I am friendly and I have a lot of life left in me.  I am a little overweight but with properly-portioned good-quality kibble and regular exercise I should easily lose those extra pounds. Senior dogs make wonderful companions because unlike puppies, we don't need a lot of exercise, we are good at entertaining ourselves, we understand the difference between a dog toy and your furniture, and we adjust easily to your schedule so you will get a good night's sleep!  I would be an ideal friend for a retired individual or couple who enjoys going for leisurely walks and having a loyal buddy laying at their feet.  I have been around children, other dogs, and even cats for most of my life so I would be a good fit for most families (little children might be a little much).  My exercise needs are moderate so although a home with fenced yard would be great, I might be ok in a ground-floor apartment or condo as long as I have an outdoor space to do my business and you are willing to take me for a couple of short walks daily.  More than anything else I am looking for a family to love me and that I can love back.  So what do you think?  If you would like more information or would like to make an appointment to meet me, please call Sandy at tele#661-824-4495 (this is a landline).  I'll be waiting for you!",

            "description": "Born February 2020, Balto is a male Husky seeking a forever home. Here is a little bit about him: He loves to play. He\u2019s usually the last one to settle down for the night. Snuggles. He loves the cats too! He likes to poke the cats and dogs with his nose. If the dogs eat out his bowl he will bark at them until they quit but yet he will he eat their food out of their bowls. He loves attention and will follow his \"person\" all around the house. Balto's forever home should be one with breed experience with a canine sibling of similar size and energy level. Applications can be accessed at www.mikeyschance.com\n\nAll large and/or active dogs will require a full fenced (6ft) secure yard. \nNo children under 5. \n\nLike all Mikey's Chance dogs, this dog will come to you from a foster home that has provided loving one-on-one attention, socialization and some basic training, as well as quality food and exercise. \n\nApplications can be found at www.mikeyschance.com and completed on a computer, tablet, and/or phone. Please note that adopters are not chosen on a first come, first served basis, but full consideration is given to the best fit for the dog AND the adopter. Applications can take up to 3 weeks to process. Application submission DOES NOT guarantee approval for adoption.",

He needs a quiet home with people who will be understanding of his needs. He can be timid sometimes. Gabe came to us because the environment where he was living was too noisy with construction and he was very scared. Gabe has not lived with cats or children. While he has very tolerant around other dogs, he will do best as an only dog where he can be loved and spoiled. Gabe is a loving goof ball who joyfully appreciates all he is given. We love his toothless smile (several front teeth had to be pulled back in October) and wagging tail! Note: Gabe needs his own yard. He is not used to pottying while on leash. \nIf you want to adopt Gabe and you can meet his needs, please fill out an adoption application http://aussierescuesandiego.org/foster-and-volunteer/adoptionapplication/. Please answer every required question, otherwise your app will not submit. You will receive an immediate confirmation once it has been submitted.

Applications can be accessed at www.mikeyschance,com\n\nNo children under 5. \n\nLike all Mikey's Chance dogs, this dog will come to you from a foster home that has provided loving one-on-one attention, socialization and some basic training, as well as quality food and exercise. \n\nApplications can be found at www.mikeyschance.com and completed on a computer, tablet, and/or phone. Please note that adopters are not chosen on a first come, first served basis, but full consideration is given to the best fit for the dog AND the adopter.

            "description": "Meet adorable Jade! She and her sister and brother (Juneau) arrived into PetConnect's care a week ago and are thriving in their foster homes. The sweeties are typical playful, loving puppies! They would love a home with another pup to play with, but they'd also be okay as an only dog. They will do well with respectful children. They will need a home with someone around during the day to continue to work with them on their housetraining and socializing. They will also need a home with a private yard where they can hang and play until they are fully vaccinated. \n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $375, which helps with the cost of routine vet care. This fee DOES NOT INCLUDE spay/neuter if the pup is not already spayed/neutered. If the animal you are adopting is not already spayed/neutered, you will be required to sign a contract legally obligating you to have the animal altered. ***Note that puppy adoption fees most often help generate revenue that goes towards older, special needs animals that need our help. Surgeries, heartworm treatment, boarding costs....all things that often result in adoptable dogs and cats being left behind to be euthanized. So adopting a puppy saves not just one life, but many! \n\nPuppies require an adopter who is home a good part of the day to continue their training - no exceptions! They are up-to-date on age appropriate vaccines and preventatives and will need to be spayed/neutered at the age of 6 months. Please note, this pup's immune system will not be fully functioning until about 16 weeks of age and therefore, s/he is not suited for Apartment/Condo living or Town homes without a private fenced yard and will not be able to go to public places where s/he could possibly be exposed to the germs of unvaccinated dogs, such as PetSmart/PetCo and dog parks until s/he is 16 weeks old\n\nFor more information, please email fbognon@petconnectrescue.org\n\n**If you're viewing this on Petfinder, please visit www.petconnectrescue.org to complete our non-binding application.**",

            "description": "Meet adorable Juneau! He and his sisters arrived into PetConnect's care a week ago and are thriving in their foster homes. The sweeties are typical playful, loving puppies! They would love a home with another pup to play with, but they'd also be okay as an only dog. They will do well with respectful children. They will need a home with someone around during the day to continue to work with them on their housetraining and socializing. They will also need a home with a private yard where they can hang and play until they are fully vaccinated. \n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $375, which helps with the cost of routine vet care. This fee DOES NOT INCLUDE spay/neuter if the pup is not already spayed/neutered. If the animal you are adopting is not already spayed/neutered, you will be required to sign a contract legally obligating you to have the animal altered. ***Note that puppy adoption fees most often help generate revenue that goes towards older, special needs animals that need our help. Surgeries, heartworm treatment, boarding costs....all things that often result in adoptable dogs and cats being left behind to be euthanized. So adopting a puppy saves not just one life, but many! \n\nPuppies require an adopter who is home a good part of the day to continue their training - no exceptions! They are up-to-date on age appropriate vaccines and preventatives and will need to be spayed/neutered at the age of 6 months. Please note, this pup's immune system will not be fully functioning until about 16 weeks of age and therefore, s/he is not suited for Apartment/Condo living or Town homes without a private fenced yard and will not be able to go to public places where s/he could possibly be exposed to the germs of unvaccinated dogs, such as PetSmart/PetCo and dog parks until s/he is 16 weeks old\n\nFor more information, please email fbognon@petconnectrescue.org\n\n**If you're viewing this on Petfinder, please visit www.petconnectrescue.org to complete our non-binding application.**",

            "description": "Born approximately January 2011, Wilbur is a very special male Terrier mix, seeking a very special home or family. Here is a little bit about him: Wilbur is one of the most gentle loving dogs we have ever come in contact with. He came to us very sick and is gradually gaining his strength and love of life back. Just after Wilbur came into the rescue he had all of his teeth removed so he will need a soft food diet or kibble very well soaked. Wilbur startles very easy as his eyes aren't as good as they once were. He gets along with all humans and dogs alike. Wilbur would thrive in a home with another dog of similar size and energy level, with a family who is home a lot (in other words that doesn't leave him for long stretches of time). He sleeps most of his days and gets small bursts of energy that he spends galloping around. Wilbur will struggle with a dog door as he is very leery of a door not being wide open. Wilbur is the bestest boy and deserves a home that will show him unconditional love! A secure fence with adults or adults and children over 5. Applications can be accessed at www.mikeyschance.com\n\nNo children under 5. \n\nLike all Mikey's Chance dogs, this dog will come to you from a foster home that has provided loving one-on-one attention, socialization and some basic training, as well as quality food and exercise. \n\nApplications can be found at www.mikeyschance.com and completed on a computer, tablet, and/or phone. Please note that adopters are not chosen on a first come, first served basis, but full consideration is given to the best fit for the dog AND the adopter. Applications can take up to 3 weeks to process. Application submission DOES NOT guarantee approval for adoption.",

            "description": "Basil is a super cute 6-year-old Cocker Spaniel mix that weighs 17 pounds. He is the sweetest little guy that will make the perfect companion for anyone! He loves exploring the backyard, playing with other dogs, doesn't mind cats, and is very social. He has never met a stranger! He would do best in a home without small children, but he loves older considerate children. He is potty trained, leash trained, and knows some tricks! His favorite pose is to sit on his hind legs like a meerkat! He is neutered, vaccinated, heartworm negative, and microchipped. He is $400 plus TX sales tax with an approved application: www.recycledpomsbcs.com/adopt\n\nTexas law requires that all humane organizations (Rescues, SPCA's, Humane Societies, State nonprofit, and charitable 501c3 exempt orgs) collect and remit sales and use tax to the Texas Comptroller on their adoption fees.\n\nWe do not ship or transport our dogs. We require all adopters to meet the dog in person to ensure it is a good fit. We represent the dog to the best of our ability and since they are in rescue, we do not always get their history.\n\nPlease note: We are a non-profit Pomeranian Rescue with dogs in private foster homes. We do not have a facility open to the public. We require an approved application before a potential adopter is introduced to a dog. We contact vet references to ensure animals in the home are current on vaccinations, heart worm prevention, and sterilization. We do not adopt our dogs to homes in which an animal is not spayed or neutered. A home visit may be required.\n\nPlease visit our website for more information and an adoption application. www.recycledpomsbcs.com",

This darling girl came to us from Armenia where a Good Samaritan found her huddled underneath a garbage can. Extremely thin and scared of the world she was brought in and cared for until she could make the trip to the US. \n\nVivi is one of those dogs that just makes you smile.  She is approximately 40 pounds and a year old.  She was extremely shy when she came to us but is GREAT with other dogs.  \n\nShe is currently in a wonderful foster home in Tustin who has been working with her shyness and helping her come out of her shell.  Because Lily is so shy with people she must go to a home with another dog. She has a tendency to follow the other dogs lead on how to act with people. \n\nShe is so much fun once she\u2019s comfortable with you. If you would like to meet her, and you have another dog,  please fill out an application:\n\nhttps://www.muttsinneed.org/adoption-application.html",

            "description": "Remington is a charming and goofy 3 year old Husky! He is full of personality and there is never a dull (or quiet!) moment when he is around! Some huskies could do with or without their humans, but Remington prefers to be around his people, soaking up all of the love like a fluffy sponge! When you meet Remington, you will find that he is full of life and his never-ending optimism is an absolute pleasure to be around! He is social and friendly with all dogs and cats! Yes\u2026even cats! \n\nThis stunning, young boy experienced a spinal stroke (Fibrocartilaginous Embolism) 4 months ago and is now paralyzed in the hind end. Despite months of Acupuncture, Laser Therapy, and Hydrotherapy, Remington was not able to regain the use of his hind legs. But don\u2019t tell him that! He now has a set of wheels, and he will run circles around you any day of the week! He loves to go on walks and explore all that the Pacific Northwest has to offer! Due to his hind end paralysis, Remington does not know when he has to go potty (he is incontinent). His incontinence is easily managed by expressing his bladder 3-4 times per day. As long as this is accomplished, he will not leak urine in between expressions and does not require a belly band. Remington is grateful for the help and will hold perfectly still for you! He scoots freely around the house during the day, and he is crate trained for sleeping at night. \n\nRemington deserves the chance to have a forever family to call his own, so if you are interested in adopting this handsome guy, please read more about our adoption process and fill out an application on our website at www.heathshavenrescue.com! He is already neutered, microchipped, current on vaccines/flea & tick preventative, and crate trained\u2026all he needs is a loving home! \n\n**We do adopt out of state as long as a home visit can be completed and transport can be arranged. Remington is too big to fly in the cabin of a plane (and we do not fly our special needs dogs as \"cargo\") so ground  transport is the only option for him.",

Since being in foster care she is learning how to walk on a leash and spending more time inside.  She would really like a home with another playful dog that can help her adjust to family life.

Chip will need crate rest until it can be determined he doesn\u2019t need further treatment on his foot. He is a little nervous at first,  but we believe a warm, calm environment as he heals will help him come out of his shell.  If you can help this sweet boy please text 702-720-8975.",

She is also a GIANT puppy. She is underweight at 58 pounds, but strong as an ox. She needs to be spayed and has some skin conditions that need treatment. While she knows basic commands like sit and shake, she has no concept of stay, come, or walk on a leash. When it comes to interaction with new folks and animals, and 'walks' outside... she is a bulldozer!! We were told that she had broken out of several crates/kennels, so Rejection Collection Boxer Rescue provided us with one of the very best escape proof crates there is. January finds it quite cozy and doesn't seem to mind spending time in it.Stay tuned for more updates.",

Will Dozer be your number one friend this year?

            "description": "Hello, my name is Mufasa (HWTH#21026A).  I am a Lab mix, born on 10/4/2010 and I weigh approximately 45 lbs.  My mother Diamond (adopted), my sister Lady (HWTH#21027A), and I were relinquished together to Halfway to Home after our owner passed away.  We are a little overwhelmed after having being taken from the only home we have ever known, but the people here are very nice and are helping us prepare to find new homes to spend our golden years.  I may be a senior, but I have a puppy-like spirit.  I am a little overweight but with properly-portioned good-quality kibble and regular exercise that spirit will live on and on. \nSenior dogs make wonderful companions because unlike puppies, we don't need a lot of exercise, we are good at entertaining ourselves, we understand the difference between a dog toy and your shoes, and adjust easily to your schedule so you will get a good night's sleep!  I would be an ideal friend for a retired individual or couple who enjoys going for leisurely walks and having a loyal buddy laying at their feet.  I have been around children, other dogs, and even cats for most of my life so I would be a good fit for most families (little children might be a little much).  My exercise needs are moderate so although a home with fenced yard would be great, I might be ok in a ground-floor apartment or condo as long as I have an outdoor space to do my business and you are willing to take me for a couple of short walks daily.  More than anything else I am looking for a family to love me  and that I can love back.  How does that sound?  If you would like more information or would like to make an appointment to meet me, please call Sandy at tele#661-824-4495 (this is a landline).  Thank you and I hope to see you soon.",

            "description": "PIPER, along with her running buddy Tipper, also posted on this Petfinder page, was picked up as a stray by Animal Control in Lauderdale County, TN. Because Piper and Tipper are such sweet tempered dogs, the Lauderdale County Animal Shelter kept them in a quiet place within the shelter instead of keeping them in the general population. Grace Rescue was asked please to take both into rescue, and we were happy to be able to oblige. Both of these Beagle babies are wonderful dogs.\n\nPiper is a pocket Beagle weighing only about 21 pounds and is estimated to be about 5 years old. She is NOT a senior Beagle snd has not even lived half of her life expectancy. Our oldest personal Beagle is 17 years old. \n\nShe has been microchipped, spayed, and our vet also did dentals at the same time to save putting Piper under anesthesia a second time. She had an abscessed tooth that needed immediate care. Her bloodwork looks GREAT, and overall she is fairly healthy. \n\nPiper is not available for regular adoption until she completes heartworm treatment; however, we ARE accepting applications for foster-to-adopt through heartworm treatment. That means that the family who fosters her through heartworm treatment will be given priority in the adoption process. We have never done that before COVID quarantines, but our Hayley, Millie and Gracie, all 3 are in foster homes through heartworm treatment, and it is a blessing to everyone. \n\nIf you think you are the right family for Piper and are interested in fostering her through complete vetting, we would be so happy to send you an adoption application. Since we never permit someone to foster that we would not approve as an adopter, we ask that potential fosters complete the same adoption application as adopters. After all, the family approved for fostering would be given top priority for adopting. So, please email Diana at dmoore2003@bellsouth.net for an application. During COVID times, we are inundated with adoption application requests for all of our Beagles, so please be a serious adopter before requesting our adoption application\u2014that you are willing to complete and submit an application for consideration. We hope to hear from you about this precious Beagle girl. \n\n",

Bo is believed to be a year old. still working on this potty training. He needs to be in a home with AN OTHER DOG. He loves them and will help him to build his trust. He needs someone very patient. He is learning how to walk on leash so following a dog is much easier for him.. Loves to play. He was moved today to his new foster Mom and right away went on the couch and snuggled under the blanket. if you are interested in helping a little guy with a big heart please email us ASAP at pets@findahomegiveahome.com\nHe is up to date on all his vaccines.

This friendly and energetic boy will need an experienced foster or adopter willing to work with a puppy who needs major work on his manners. He was returned to the shelter for being extremely nippy/mouthy (non-aggressive, but very stubborn) and the staff confirmed that behavior. He was fine for us, was a little nippy and rambunctious, but we distracted him with some fetch and it seemed to calm him down. \n\nNeeds someone who can be the pack leader and in charge so he can become the great dog he can surely be. He\u2019s very smart and knows some commands. But he doesn\u2019t really listen to correction. For additional info or to meet him please text 702-239-7986. UPDATE .

Heartworm is a mosquito transmitted, preventable disease. Fortunately, there is both a preventative and a cure for Heartworm. While treatment is a costly, 4 month long process, prevention is an inexpensive, once-a-month chewable. TLC covers the cost of each dog\u2019s heartworm treatment, as well as provides support to ensure the best quality of life for our pups. Once cured, most dogs go on to lead a happy & healthy life! The key to this happiness is that once-a-month heartworm preventative, in which you can receive directly from your veterinarian.

Princess has been spayed she has been given all her shots and has been chipped. We are trying to find princess a forever loving family and a permanent home where she will not no longer suffer any more abuse. She deserves the best she is a great dog please contact us if you have any more questions text is always best or email please let me know a little bit about yourself thanks.",

He was apparently attacked by four other dogs and still has the healing wounds from that attack. \n\nEven after being attacked he is still one of the sweetest dog you\u2019ll ever meet. He\u2019s extremely sweet with all the dogs that he needs and just wants affection from the people.

She is a velcro dog. Deaf dogs need to see you to look for visuals and to remain comfortable in their new surroundings and she is no exception. She will bark when in her area if she cannot see you, she will bark every time if you go back and forth if she catches a glimpse of you. She will stop barking and go lay in her kennel once she realizes you aren't coming back in sight. Deaf dogs are heavy sleepers and it's best to softly touch them when waking them up...or sometimes I lightly stomp of the floor. The vibrations help them know someone is there. Also when approaching her...I smile, and do a wave. Thumbs up means good girl, and normal hand commands one might use for sit, stay and lay down (I always throw some other signs in I know for deaf dogs) but to each their own. She is VERY treat motivated and know's sit,shake, and stay. I gave her a bath already, and I'm sure she'll get another at the vet. She did well in the tub. She has had zero potty accidents in the house. She does enjoy someone outside with her(probably cause it's still new) but will go in and out one her own in my fenced yard. She does ok with the kids, but it's good to keep an eye on her when she's around kids -- deaf dogs (at least the one's I've had here) seem to paw more than my hearing dogs, and they are face level to kids and can hurt them if it's unexpected. I feed her 4 times a day. 1 cup about every 4 hours. Im not sure if that's a lot, but she's on the skinny side, and it not disagreeing with her. Over all she's a very nice boxer girl.",

            "description": "This compact-size lover-boy was brought to Colorado after a bunch of dogs on streets of New Mexico attacked him. He was saved by volunteers, treated for his leg injury, and now has comfortable settled in his foster home and ready to bring some joy to you, his future family! \n\nElijah is a mellow pit mix dog with loving personality, he is particularly good at giving kisses! He is a happy camper outside on a walk or a very long walk, but is also content curling up next to you (or on you) for a sweet nap! He is learning fast and pretty smart, he will need to continued training and getting better on the leash, of course. Gentle leader worked wonders! He is playful too, but could be dog-selective due to his past misfortune. He likes foster\u2019s resident female dog, but she is 14 and playing is really a nuisance for her due to her golden age. So when he gets bored he tries to play with cats, which they graciously decline ? Since the male dogs attacked him, he is cautionary about making friends with male dogs, but given his friendly demeanor and some patience, he will overcome this fear for sure, he is good with females.  He is house trained, given opportunity to go out regularly, not a chewer, unless it\u2019s a smelly cow hoof or tears, not a barker, has gentle mouth, and still needs to learn some basic manners. Oh, he gets along with 3 resident cats! What a catch! \nSince he is at young age of around a year- year-and-half, he would love to find a worthy playmate. Though he loves his Hoomans so much, that if there is someone who will provide activities, stimulating his curiosity and spend time with him, he might be ok as well. He sleeps in his crate through the night and doesn\u2019t mind it a bit. No anxiety, but of course, he would rather sleep in your bed! He probably will leak the little ones to death, but still jumps when excited, so it might not be ideal with young kids. \nElijah is truly a wonderful,  loving, easy going, well responding to positive stimulation and easily redirect able, eager to please dog. He will return trifold your kindness and love if you give  him a chance! Take that chance!!! Apply at fromforgottentoforever.com/adoptionapplication/.",

He is really low maintenance. The first few days I wondered, are they sure he's not deaf? He responds better to hand signals then commands. Maybe he cant understand our Minnesota accents! He doesn't mind the snow. The cat and Deuce have warmed up to each other. I've given him a little more freedom. Yesterday Deuce helped me do laundry so he went up and down the steps a lot. All in all, he's getting good exercise. He likes his walks, he doesn't pull on the leash. He doesn't seem to have any hip or joint issues that we can tell from petting and manipulating his legs. I tried to put some earwash on a cotton ball to clean his ears and found out he did NOT like it. Deuce doesn't beg for food, you can eat in front of him and doesn't surf the counters or get into anything. He's pretty smart, he can open doors (bathroom) if you don't close them all the way. Deuce is fine in his crate. He really could care less about toys at this point in time. I put a camera on when we left the house to see how he does all alone -- took a nap and waited for us to get back. What a easy peasy precious boxer boy!",

He was so scared and we knew he had to become a member of the LAF family. Once Blacky arrived we saw something wasn't right with his tail. While he was being neutered we did x-rays and there is an old, healed break. His tail works, doesn't bother him in any way, so we opted to leave it as is, it gives him charm! Blacky is good with other dogs, appears to be house trained, not too bad on the leash and he is a sweet and happy boy!\n\nEmail dogs@labradorsandfriends.org or fill out our online application at\nwww.labradorsandfriends.org\nBlacky is located in Southern California.",

We think Miss Foxy is between 1 to 2 years old.\n\nFoxy was in a foster home with 12 and 14 year old kids and was good with them.  She is still a bit too jumpy and ebullient for a home with younger kids.  \n\nFoxy is very playful and would be fine having a doggie friend who is equally playful and understands her excitement level for playing:-)    Foxy is not good with cats however. \n\nWe saved this sweet, affectionate girl from euthanasia at a high kill shelter just in time. \n\nPlease contact Christine at christinerescueexpress@gmail.com if interested.",

Thank you for your patience! We are working to find everyone a companion. \n\nPrincess Ruby is an adorable 9 week old Hound/Black Mouth cur mix. These puppies are huge!! \n\nIf you are interested in adopting the first step is to fill out an adoption application on our website aaanimalrescue.org. We are currently very busy! Please reach out to allaboardanimalrescue@gmail.com if you have an approved application on file! Please fill out an adoption application on our website if you are ready to adopt! \n\nThank you for your patience and understanding during this difficult time! We are on a mission to find everyone companions, we will continue to rescue dogs weekly! We update our page every Monday evening. We are not currently hosting any Petco adoption events for the public. We will be hosting meet/greet adoption appointments!\n\n\nBreed and size disclosure: As a rescue all of our dogs come to us from high-kill shelters or other rescues, so we do not get a lot of background or information on these dogs. We occasionally receive the mother with the puppies, but in most cases both parents are unknown. Because of this we do not know the full breeding of the dogs. We are required to list the dogs based on the breeds provided to us on their records, but they are all mixed breeds as far as we know, and we cannot guarantee the actual breeds of any of these dogs. Since the full breeding of the dogs is unknown we can also only give you an educated guess on the full-grown size of the dogs. All of the current information we have on the dogs is listed in their bio above. More information may be available at our adoption event, since a lot of the fosters turn in report cards on how the dog has done in their care when they drop them off. \n\nAdoption Process: If you are interested in adopting from us, the first step of our adoption process is to fill out an application online at http://aaanimalrescue.org/adoption_app.html. It takes us 24-48 hours to process your application and get back to you, via email. Applications turned in Friday afternoon or Saturday morning will not be processed since we are preparing for or at our adoption event. We do have applications on site at our events, but are not always able to approve them at that time and many of the dogs will already have holds on them, so we suggest you fill out an application prior to attending an adoption event. We can place a hold on one dog per approved applicant after a deposit fee has been received, please do not ask to hold a dog if you have not turned in an application and been approved, for the first hour of our adoption event, so that they can get the first chance to meet and hopefully adopt that dog. After the first hour of the event all dogs are available on a first come, first serve basis. If you already have an approved application on file, there will just be more paperwork and the adoption fee at the event, but you will be able to take home the dog/puppy that day. Since we are foster based and do not have a location, our dogs are only available to meet at our events, unless otherwise noted.",

We are not currently hosting any Petco adoption events for the public. We will be hosting meet/greet adoption appointments!\n\n\nBreed and size disclosure: As a rescue all of our dogs come to us from high-kill shelters or other rescues, so we do not get a lot of background or information on these dogs. We occasionally receive the mother with the puppies, but in most cases both parents are unknown. Because of this we do not know the full breeding of the dogs. We are required to list the dogs based on the breeds provided to us on their records, but they are all mixed breeds as far as we know, and we cannot guarantee the actual breeds of any of these dogs. Since the full breeding of the dogs is unknown we can also only give you an educated guess on the full-grown size of the dogs. All of the current information we have on the dogs is listed in their bio above. More information may be available at our adoption event, since a lot of the fosters turn in report cards on how the dog has done in their care when they drop them off. \n\nAdoption Process: If you are interested in adopting from us, the first step of our adoption process is to fill out an application online at http://aaanimalrescue.org/adoption_app.html. It takes us 24-48 hours to process your application and get back to you, via email. Applications turned in Friday afternoon or Saturday morning will not be processed since we are preparing for or at our adoption event. We do have applications on site at our events, but are not always able to approve them at that time and many of the dogs will already have holds on them, so we suggest you fill out an application prior to attending an adoption event. We can place a hold on one dog per approved applicant after a deposit fee has been received, please do not ask to hold a dog if you have not turned in an application and been approved, for the first hour of our adoption event, so that they can get the first chance to meet and hopefully adopt that dog. After the first hour of the event all dogs are available on a first come, first serve basis. If you already have an approved application on file, there will just be more paperwork and the adoption fee at the event, but you will be able to take home the dog/puppy that day. Since we are foster based and do not have a location, our dogs are only available to meet at our events, unless otherwise noted.",

NATCHEZ was more or less abandoned in a pen with Vidalia for at least a year and was fed and brought water by a local rescuer every couple of days since last February 2020. We can't really blame NATCHEZ for being unsure around humans, but he is already starting to enjoy being petted and held.

He enjoys playing with his foster sister, doing sprints in the backyard and cuddling with his foster mom and the little boy in the house. Pharaoh does great in his crate, walks well on a leash and he is house trained. Overall he is a perfect boy looking for the perfect family!!  Pharaoh's adoption fee is $250.00.\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

For only $5 a month you can read wonderful stories about the animals who have come through our program. everything from how we got started to cruelty and rehabilitation cases. This money goes directly to caring for the animals in our program as well as helps save others desperately needing rescue. Thank you in advance - we seriously could not do what we do without your support. \n\n**IMPORTANT!!  Please read the entire bio before contacting us with questions. Send us an email requesting an application to start the adoption process adopt@almosthomenm.org   Make sure you add our address to your safe sender list or watch your junk/spam emails.  For more photos please visit our Facebook page.   http://www.facebook.com/pages/Almost-Home-New-Mexico/203840136304815 \n\nApproximate DOB 5/26/2011\n\nSize - Medium about 40 lbs\n\nHistory- Merlin was rescued about 7 years ago by a wonderful couple. He has lived with him and has been awesome with everyone he meets. He is a perfect gentleman at all times. However, recently the family has had some losses and due to family health issues and obligations feel Merlin is not getting the love and attention he had become accustomed to. They love him dearly and want the best for him so they have reached out to us in hopes of finding him a family that can give him the one on one attention and love he craves. \n\nTemperament- Very sweet, gentle, and loving. Really a perfect dog.\n\nEnergy Level- Still pretty active despite his age. Is not a jogger but would love walks and hanging with a loved one on the couch. \n\nDogs/Cats- He has met several dogs as they were avid fosters and have a boarding kennel as well. He loves playing with everyone big or small. I believe he has a high prey drive though so cannot be with chickens, ducks, or rabbits - he will kill them. I will ask if he has been around cats. \n\nHousetrained- He is perfect. Uses a dog door on his own. Never marks in the house. Just the best boy ever.\n\nMerlin is pretty much the best dog someone could want. He is perfectly behaved. Does not jump on you, or get under foot. I've never heard him bark though I am sure he does when people pull up but stops quickly. He is perfect for the groomer. He would be great for someone at home who likes walks, playing, and cuddles. He does need to stay on a schedule with a groomer due to his coat but other than that one thing he is a seriously amazing dog.\n\nAdoption fee $200 includes neuter, age appropriate vaccinations (4 for puppies), deworming, microchip, rabies, collar and leash, training information, and all the support you need. \n\nSend us an e-mail to adopt@almosthomenm.org requesting an application to adopt this sweetie!! Animals are seen by appointment only. An application must be submitted to us prior to making an appointment. We do give a discount when adopting multiple pets.\n\nIf you would like to donate to our cause and help care for the animals in our care please visit our main website www.almosthomenm.org and click on the donate button at the top left of the screen..",

He came from the mean streets of Mexico where his foot was run over by a car and left unattended.  Once he arrived with the rescue we had x-rays done and found that the bones are completely crushed and there is no saving it. He is scheduled for an amputation on the first. We are desperately searching for a foster for him so he does not have to be in a kennel environment after the surgery. \n\nHe is approximately four years old and 20 pounds of pure love.  He gets along with all size dogs. And although he might not look like a corgi in the pictures that you met him in person with his little nub tail you\u2019ll see the breed in him. \n\nWe are still getting to know him but so far everything we found out about him we absolutely adore. He\u2019s a very resilient boy who just wants to give and receive love. \n\nIf you would like to meet him please fill out an application. \n\nhttps://www.muttsinneed.org/adoption-application.html\n",

To help keep all parties safe we will not be holding adoption events or meeting in any store locations. All meet and greets will be private and held at an outdoor location in Lake Elmo.\n\nAdoption fee: $450 cash or card only  (There is a $10 fee to use a card) NO CHECKS\n\nAge: 9 months  \nDOB Approx. 4-22-20\nGender: male\nAltered: yes\nBreed: wire hair terrier mix not sure what they are mixed with \nApprox Weight Now: 30 pounds\nApprox Weight Grown: 35-45 ? \nDog-friendly: Yes\nCat-friendly: Yes\nKid-friendly: Yes\nHouse Trained: Yes to the best of our knowledge\nCrate-Trained: yes\nBenefit From Formal Training: Would benefit from training\nEnergy level: Moderate\nHistory: Was adopted and returned\nRec'd into Puppy Tails: originally 6-26-20 returned 1-23-21 \n\nEddison is from a litter we had this past summer. His family is no longer able to keep him. He is a very sweet boy. He loves to snuggle and done well with everyone he has been introduced to. He loves to play out in the snow with Hudson and does fairly well on the leash. He seems to have basic commands down but would benefit from training. He appears to be housebroken and crate trained but we always recommend a refresher in his new home. \n\nHe does chew and would benefit from training to work on this. Also recommended that he has plenty of toys and other things for him to chew on. \n\nEddison does not like hard floors so he will need some time to learn how to use them if you have them. We are currently working on it with him. He is getting better every day and is now exploring the house more.",

            "description": "If you are looking for the happiest, most social dog Laila is your girl! This girl has never met a stranger and is always so happy to meet new people and other dogs. She gets so excited that her whole butt wags! She loves her toys and she has some puppy energy but once she wears herself out she is the BEST cuddle partner. She's a very smart puppy and any additional training should be a breeze for her. She's doing great with potty training and we're working on crate training. She will cry for a few minutes when she first goes in but then she settles down quietly, especially if she has treats or toys to keep her busy. She does have some skin allergies to certain grasses that could require allergy medication depending on your lifestyle and location. Regular baths and short periods of time outside help to manager her allergies. Laila is a pitbull mix with an estimated dob 10/20/2020. She was found abandoned in a creek with her siblings at about 6 weeks old. She is currently 18 lbs at 14 weeks old.\n\nLaila is available for adoption with Saving Grace Dog Rescue of San Antonio. The adoption fee is $150.00. An adoption application, home visit and adoption contract are all required. All dogs are spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccinations appropriate for their age, microchipped, and wormed for internal and external parasites. If you would like more information or an adoption application, please email us at sgdrsa@outlook.com.",

She will need a little patience as she learns right from wrong, as all puppies do. She loves to be cuddled, and plays well with the dogs at her foster home. She will love you unconditionally as you teach her. Are you her loving family that will give her a forever home?\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, rabies (if puppy is old enough), distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing (if puppy is old enough), monthly heartworm prevention while in our care, monthly flea/tick prevention while in our care, and our transport costs. As part of the adoption agreement, adopters agree to get the pup spayed/neutered and provide K-9 Lifesavers with proof of spay/neuter. K-9 Lifesavers does not cover the cost of spay/neuter for puppies 6 months or younger.\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\nHelp Save Lives! Make a tax-deductible donation today and help save a life. Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support! We are all volunteer based organization so every cent from your donation goes directly to the dogs in our care.\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\nCheck out our social media!

My favorite thing is to play, jump and walk with you!  I\u2019ll be the perfect companion!  I also love playing with kids and other dogs!  I love cuddles, head scratches and playing with anything squeaky! I also like to give lots of kisses. I know how to sit and lie down and will be attentive to you at all times. I am crate trained and I know how to use a doggy door to do my business outside. I am a very loyal, happy, playful dog for any type of home!\n\nEmail info@habitat4paws.org for an application.\n\n**Because we require home visits, we only adopt locally to the Dallas/Fort Worth area.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Bruce is a handsome dark brindle American Pitbull that was born on or around 8/1/2020. He was found abandoned in Mobile with several other dogs and puppies. Bruce has had a rough start but that doesn't stop him from living his best life.\n\nBruce is the most cuddly dog, he would love nothing more than to watch Netflix on the couch with you all day. Although Bruce loves cuddles he definitely enjoys his outside time with his doggy friends and his toys. Bruce needs to be with another calm or boundary respected friend. Bruce does not do well with other dogs that are all in his face or overly dominant.\n\nBruce is doing fantastic with basic commands, crate training and he is currently working on house manners. If you're interested in adopting Bruce please submit your application today\n\nAmazing Grace Bully Rescue is a foster based rescue in the Pensacola, Florida area. We do not have a physical building. If you would like to meet any of our pups, the first step is to fill out our online application so we can contact you.\n\nOur adoption fee for Bruce is $225and includes four sets of puppy shots, two dewormings (done prior to adoption) his neuter, current shots, rabies vaccine, and a registered microchip.\n\nIf you would like to adopt this Amazing dog, please fill out our online adoption application at www.amazinggracebullyrescue.org\n\nIf you have any questions, please text your question to 723-2037.

She heads north `1/30\n\n\nPlease note: Little Black Dog Rescue is a FOSTER BASED rescue based in Fairfield County, Connecticut. We do NOT have a facility where you can come meet the dogs. We do adoption events every few months but primarily work one-on-one with each applicant to match the right dog to the right family. Once your application is received, all questions can be answered. We currently adopt to homes along the East Coast of the United States.  The adoption fee ranges from $250-$525 depending on age of the dog and transport distance/cost.\n\nPlease go to our website at www.littleblackdogrescue.org to see more information and to fill out our online application. Applications are required before conversations about potential matches can begin. Please check our website for up to date availability.\n\n We are a non profit organization and the adoption fee goes towards the transport, vetting, spay/neuter and boarding needs of the dogs we rescue. LBDR is a small rescue that receives a minor discount on vetting unlike larger rescues who self-administer or receive volume discounts. LBDR focuses on the rescue, care and placement of black dogs who are in danger of euthanasia due to their color, as well as other dogs who are in immediate need. LBDR is funded by donations which are used solely for the \ncare of our dogs.",

Orca is a shy girl looking for a patient home that will work with her and help her continue to boost her confidence. She gets more confident with each passing day, and has learned the joys of squeaky toys and doing zoomies! She is fostered with other dogs but prefers those on the medium-large side; no small dogs, please! Her smallest friend is about 45 pounds. She is crate trained, but is working on potty training. Orca is very food motivated and loves to receive cheese as treats. She's a leaner, loving to lean into her foster mom while receiving pets. Orca is working on getting comfortable on the leash. Due to this, she is looking for a home with a fenced in yard and is not suitable for apartment life. She knows how to sit and is working on giving paw! She tends to get overwhelmed easily, so she is looking for an adult only household, as she is not a fan of kids' loud noises and quick movements. Orca's lack of confidence is something her forever family should be prepared to work on. If you think your household is the right place to help Orca blossom, apply online today!\n\nMy adoption fee is $250.",

It took a few days, but a couple dedicated dog-lovers worked to gain her trust enough to get her contained. Once she realized she was safe, she melted back into the sweetest girl who will now make a great addition to just about any home!\n\nLiberty was super skinny when she joined us but has plumped up nicely\u00a0in her foster home. She's a healthy\u00a0girl who received a dental cleaning and was spayed and received a clean bill of health from our vet. She is currently living with other dogs, cats and children! She gets along with everyone great. She adores her foster family and will happily snuggle up on the couch (or in bed if allowed). In fact, she can get comfortable just about anywhere! We think Liberty will just need a little time to settle into her future home, as she gets a bit shy and nervous in new situations but given the chance, settles in quickly and will be your best friend in no time!\n\nLiberty is available for adoption through City of Elderly Love! She is spayed, vaccinated and microchipped. Interested in adopting her? Visit www.cityofelderlylove.org to complete an online adoption questionnaire or email us at info@cityofelderlylove.org!",

            "description": "BEXLEY, shelter number D21-01025, is a female possibly Kelpi or Border Collie mix...we aren't really sure, but we sure think that she's a very pretty dog ! She is about one year old and weighs around 35 to 40 pounds. She is just a little shy still and has no obvious health or behavioral problems that we are aware of. She should be good with kids and most other dogs. With any of our dogs, it\u2019s a good idea for potential adopters with other dogs at home to bring them out to meet the potential adoptee dog before making a final decision.\nBEXLEY would make a great indoor/outdoor dog. She has short hair and will not tolerate cold weather very well. She should at least be allowed to sleep indoors and be brought in during cold, wet or stormy weather during the day if possible. She should have plenty of water and good shade if left outside in the summer. She would make a great companion for watching TV and seems to have quite a bit of stamina for jogging or walking.\nBEXLEY is looking for a chance at a forever home.\nLevelland Animal Control is understaffed right now and adoptions are by appointment only. If you would like to meet BEXLEY for a possible adoption, please call (806) 891-0829 from 9 to 5; if (806) 891-0829 doesn\u2019t answer, call (806) 894-6164 and tell them you are interested in adopting a dog. You may need to refer to BEXLEY by her shelter number, D21-01025, when talking to an Animal Control employee.\n\nAll our dogs are vaccinated for Parvo, distemper, Bordetella (kennel cough) and most other common dog diseases. We do not vaccinate them for Rabies. There is no adoption fee, but the adopter will be responsible for having the dog spayed or neutered and for the Rabies shot.\nCheck the Google map for directions to the shelter.",

COCO is blind in one eye but has no problem getting around or finding her food and water bowl. She likes short, slow walks and does well in the car. Other dogs or cats are no issue for COCO as she is 100% non-reactive. She has no behavioral issues! COCO prefers being a Floor Potato rather than a Couch Potato when relaxing and also loves to have her ears and chin scratched.\u00a0\nShe is quite the little sausage so can't go up and down the stairs but can handle one step or a curb. She would do best in a single level home.\nCOCO has a heart murmur and needs to be on daily meds which are not expensive. Losing a few pounds would be beneficial for her health. She weighs 15lbs at present. \n?\nIf you are interested in adopting sweet COCO, please go to our website www.somersetcottagepoodlerescue.org and click on adopt to download an adoption application.\n\nCOCO'S Adoption  donation is $395\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Unfortunately, Harley was returned to the shelter due to his elderly adopter going into an assisted living facility. Now he is a Faithful Friend looking for his forever home. \nHarley can be a bit shy at first, but is a very sweet guy who loves attention. He has been fine with other dogs that we've introduced him to, but is new to the program so we are still getting to know him. \nHarley has been clean in his crate, but we do not know if he is housebroken. Harley should be fine with older/calm kids, but young/noisy kids will likely make him nervous.\n\nPlease visit our website at faithfulfriendsrescue.org/adoptable-pets if you are interested in adopting.\n\nWe are setting up adoptions with approved adopters on an appointment basis. We are no longer hosting adoption events at PetSmart until further notice. We are not arranging meet and greets; but appointments to finalize adoptions to limit exposure for all. Our adoptions come with a one week trial period in which if things are not working out, we will refund your adoption fee if you decide to return your newly adopted Faithful Friend. Our adoptions must be done in person and we do not arrange transport to adopters. Our adoption fees vary and we are only able to accept payments by card* at this time but include spay/neuter, heartworm test (dogs), FeLV/FIV test (cats), age appropriate vaccines and deworming, flea, tick and heartworm medication and microchip.",

            "description": "OCTAVIA, shelter number D21-01029, is a female Belgian Malinois mix. She and her brother, LINCOLN, came into the shelter together. She has no health or behavioral issues that we know of. She is about 6-7 months old and weighs about 35-40 pounds. She is learning to walk on leash and she is young and energetic. OCTAVIA is still a little shy and these pictures were taken on her first day in the shelter.\nOCTAVIA has short to medium hair and will not tolerate cold weather very well. She should at least be allowed to sleep indoors and be brought in during cold, wet or stormy weather during the day if possible. She should have plenty of water and good shade if left outside in the summer. Ideally, she would be an indoor/outdoor dog in her new home. She should be good with kids of all ages if introduced properly and with other dogs. With any of our dogs, it\u2019s a good idea for potential adopters with other dogs at home to bring them out to meet the potential adoptee dog before making a final decision.\nLevelland Animal Control is understaffed right now and adoptions are by appointment only. If you would like to meet OCTAVIA or any of our other dogs for a possible adoption, please call (806) 891-0829 from 9 to 5; If (806) 891-0829 doesn\u2019t answer, call (806) 894-6164 and tell them you are interested in adopting a dog. You may need to refer to OCTAVIA by her shelter number, D21-01029, when talking to an Animal Control employee.\nAll our dogs are vaccinated for Parvo, distemper, Bordetella (kennel cough) and most other common dog diseases. We do not vaccinate them for Rabies. There is no adoption fee.\nCheck the Google map for directions to the shelter.",

She may have had a rough start, being tied outside in all weather, but she's settling into domesticated life like a pro!  She loves to cuddle up on the couch!  She's smart and has already learned sit, stay (mostly), and shake. She's totally potty trained and scratches the door to let you know she needs to go out (or barks when crated to alert).  Having been an outside dog for all her life until now, she does still need to learn some manners, like not to bark at visitors or jump in excitement when you come home. She's also very interested in food and likes to share your food, so you may need to crate her during meals. She loves to play with squeaky toys, balls, you name it. She's good with kids and other dogs, but quickly made clear she wants to be top dog, so if you already have a top dog that doesn't like to share, she might not be the right fit for you. She's a sweet, cuddle bug!\n\nHeart-worm negative, current on vaccines.  If not already spayed/neutered - it is included in adoption fee.\n\n\n",

            "description": "LINCOLN, shelter number D21-01030, is a friendly male Belgian Malinois mix. He and his sister, OCTAVIA, came into the shelter together. He is a nice dog and has no health or behavioral issues that we know of. He is about 6-7 months old and weighs about 40 pounds. He is learning to walk on leash. He is still a little shy and these pictures were taken on his first day in the shelter.\nLINCOLN has short to medium hair and will not tolerate cold weather very well. He should at least be allowed to sleep indoors and be brought in during cold, wet or stormy weather during the day if possible. He should have plenty of water and good shade if left outside in the summer. Ideally, he would be an indoor/outdoor dog in his new home. He should be good with kids of all ages and with other dogs. With any of our dogs, it\u2019s a good idea for potential adopters with other dogs at home to bring them out to meet the potential adoptee dog before making a final decision.\nLevelland Animal Control is understaffed right now and adoptions are by appointment only. If you would like to meet LINCOLN or any of our other dogs for a possible adoption, please call (806) 891-0829 from 9 to 5; If (806) 891-0829 doesn\u2019t answer, call (806) 894-6164 and tell them you are interested in adopting a dog. You may need to refer to LINCOLN by his shelter number, D21-01030, when talking to an Animal Control employee.\nAll our dogs are vaccinated for Parvo, distemper, Bordetella (kennel cough) and most other common dog diseases. We do not vaccinate them for Rabies. There is no adoption fee.\nCheck the Google map for directions to the shelter.",

Large dogs like Zoell are often very gentle but can still knock a small child or elderly person off their feet unknowingly. This fetching girl is suited for active people who understand her needs for exercise at this crucial age. She may be a good fit for another dog with the right chemistry. Having pounced on a chicken in her previous home, it is thought she may have a prey drive unwelcome to cats also.\n\nApproved applicants receive priority.\nClick on the \"More About Us\" link to get to our Adoption Application\n\nEmail completed applications to: sandraschiller3008@gmail.com",

PLEASE READ ENTIRE BIO BEFORE EMAILING****\n\n*Name: Asher\n*Age: 7 yrs\n*Current Weight: 10lbs\n*Adoption fee: $300\n*Health: up to date on required vaccines, neutered, has spinal disc compression \n\nAsher is a very smart quirky guy with a sad past. Asher was found in a dumpster by a good samaritan who then brought him to the local shelter in GA. When he arrived they noticed he had no use of his hind legs. People immediately started to post him on social media to save his life. He had literally 10 minutes left on the clock before he was to be euthanized when SNARR NE stepped in and took him into rescue. He was then transported to NY where his foster mom and physical therapist picked him up and took him to our specialist for immediate surgery. A compressed disc was hindering his ability to walk. Within days post spinal surgery he began to heal and regain the use of this legs. \nHe is still on the mend but can walk and climb a ramp all by himself. He does have stiff knees that need massaging and lots of walking will do wonders. He still leaks urine so he does wear a belly band diaper, but will wait to make poop outdoors. \nAsher is a one woman kind of man. He picks his person and that\u2019s who he trusts. Once he\u2019s picked you he will be loyal to no end, but can get snappy with other people. He will love his person strongly, coming running to greet you at the door and wait for you if you leave. He loves to burrow under covers and is a great snuggler. \n\nThe best household for Asher would be someone single with no children who is looking for a companion dog. He likes other dogs and will occasionally participate in play, but really he just likes his person the best. Are you his person?\n\nTo apply to adopt Asher, fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. \n**Meet and greets will not be scheduled without an approved application.**\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n-------------------------------------------------------\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $375 for adults. Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n\n\n",

This super sweet dude would LOVE a fursibling to get his zoomies out with. He is also a fan of frequent naps. We're working on potty training but he is doing exceedingly well so far! He is still learning manners and will require a family who has the love, time and dedication to teach him to be on his best behavior. \n\nFOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS TO BE CONSIDERED: \n\nTo adopt, complete the application at tarnj.org/adopt\n\nIf you have any questions at all, please DO NOT use the PetFinder inquiry form as we do not respond to those. Questions should be sent to info@tarnj.org. \n\nAn application is required before any meets are scheduled so the best way to be considered is to apply ASAP at tarnj.org/adopt.\n\nWe are all volunteer-run and do our best to respond to every application.

            "description": "ANSON, shelter number D21-01024, is a friendly male pit bull mix. He is a very nice dog and has no health or behavioral issues that we know of. ANSON is about two years old and weighs around 50-55 pounds. He walks beautifully on leash and would make a great walking and hiking buddy !! He is a very laid back fellow !\nANSON has short hair and will not tolerate cold weather very well. He should at least be allowed to sleep indoors and be brought in during cold, wet or stormy weather during the day if possible. He should have plenty of water and good shade if left outside in the summer. He has the temperament to make a good house dog and ideally would be an indoor/outdoor dog in his new home. He should be good with kids of all ages and with other dogs. With any of our dogs, it\u2019s a good idea for potential adopters with other dogs at home to bring them out to meet the potential adoptee dog before making a final decision.\nLevelland Animal Control is understaffed right now and adoptions are by appointment only. If you would like to meet ANSON or any of our other dogs for a possible adoption, please call (806) 891-0829 from 9 to 5. If (806) 891-0829 doesn\u2019t answer, call (806) 894-6164 and tell them you are interested in adopting a dog. You may need to refer to ANSON by his shelter number, D21-01024, when talking to an Animal Control employee.\nAll our dogs are vaccinated for Parvo, distemper, Bordetella (kennel cough) and most other common dog diseases. We do not vaccinate them for Rabies. There is no adoption fee.\nCheck the Google map for directions to the shelter.",

Effy and his brother Pinto go in the crate together when we aren't home. They don't mind their crate at all. He isn't a big fan of the cold weather, he goes outside to go potty and is ready to come back in the warm house. He walks well on leash though.

My name is Sherlock and I am a 10 year old, 20lbs Dachshund Terrier mix.\n\n- I was dropped off at the shelter overweight, with failing eyesight, and in need of some serious dental work. However, thanks to my amazing foster parents, I am now in great condition and ready to find my forever home!\n\n- I love everyone! Adults, kids, and dogs alike but would probably prefer to live in a home without young kids since my vision isn\u2019t what it used to be, and kids racing around may confuse me.\n\n- I love going on adventures with you, but bring a backpack so I can take breaks and chill when it gets too intense, as I am still an older man even if I don't look it ;) \n\n- The past is in the past. Although we're not sure where I came from, I hold no grudges. I am quick to love anyone who will love me and can't wait to kiss you all over and cuddle!!!\n\n- I really love if there's a human, or dog, walking close to me so I can just follow their lead. In fact I will need a home with another dog, so I can feel safe and follow their lead :) \n\n- I don't have the best vision these days but that just means I\u2019ll never care how you look, just how many pets you'll give me! \n\n- All the love please! Even though I can't see you coming, I've proven to not be reactive when it comes to physical touch. So...again...all the pets please!!!!!\n\nIf you see me online I am still available for adoption! If you are interested in adopting me please fill out an application here: www.hitlivingfoundation.org/adoption-application, and email a video walkthrough of your home and yard to BOTH Nicole@hitlivingfoundation.org AND Marta@hitlivingfoundation.org. Your application will not be counted as valid without your video. You will hear back from us within a few days.",

            "description": "WINNIE, shelter number D21-01023, is a female Boxer/Pitbull mix. She is about two years old and weighs around 40 pounds. She is a little bit shy, but very sweet ! She has no obvious health or behavioral problems. She walks well on leash and enjoys being petted. She is a very laid back girl. She should be good with kids and with most other dogs. With any of our dogs, it\u2019s a good idea for potential adopters with other dogs at home to bring them out to meet the potential adoptee dog before making a final decision.\nWINNIE would make a great indoor/outdoor dog. She has short hair and so she would not tolerate cold weather fairly well. She should be allowed to sleep indoors and be brought in during cold, wet or stormy weather during the day if possible. She should have plenty of water and good shade if left outside in the summer. She would make a great companion for watching TV or just hanging out in the evenings and would love to be included in any family activities indoors or out whenever possible.\nWINNIE is looking for another chance at a forever home.\nLevelland Animal Control is understaffed right now and adoptions are by appointment only. If you would like to meet ZENA for a possible adoption, please call (806) 891-0829 from 9 to 5; if (806) 891-0829 doesn\u2019t answer, call (806) 894-6164 and tell them you are interested in adopting a dog. You may also need to refer to WINNIE by her shelter number, D21-01023, when talking to an Animal Control employee.\nAll shelter dogs are vaccinated for Parvo, distemper, Bordetella (kennel cough) and most other common dog diseases. We do not vaccinate them for Rabies. There is no adoption fee, but the adopter will be responsible for having the dog spayed or neutered and for the Rabies shot.\nCheck the Google map for directions to the shelter located at 109 Commerce in Levelland, Texas.",

            "description": "ZENA, shelter number D21-01028, is a female Shepherd/Husky mix. She is about two years old and weighs about 40 pounds. She was surrendered to the shelter by her owner who said they could no longer take care of her. She is quite friendly and has no obvious health or behavioral problems. She walks fairly well on leash and enjoys people. She is energetic and would probably make a good jogging companion. She should be good with kids and with most other dogs. With any of our dogs, it\u2019s a good idea for potential adopters with other dogs at home to bring them out to meet the potential adoptee dog before making a final decision.\nZENA would make a great indoor/outdoor dog. She has medium thick hair and so she could tolerate cold weather fairly well. She should at least be allowed to sleep indoors and be brought in during cold, wet or stormy weather during the day if possible. She should have plenty of water and good shade if left outside in the summer due to her thicker coat. She would make a great companion for watching TV or just hanging out in the evenings and would love to be included in any family activities indoors or out whenever possible.\nZENA is looking for another chance at a forever home.\nLevelland Animal Control is understaffed right now and adoptions are by appointment only. If you would like to meet ZENA for a possible adoption, please call (806) 891-0829 from 9 to 5; if (806) 891-0829 doesn\u2019t answer, call (806) 894-6164 and tell them you are interested in adopting a dog. You may also need to refer to ZENA by her shelter number, D21-01028, when talking to an Animal Control employee.\nAll shelter dogs are vaccinated for Parvo, distemper, Bordetella (kennel cough) and most other common dog diseases. We do not vaccinate them for Rabies. There is no adoption fee, but the adopter will be responsible for having the dog spayed or neutered and for the Rabies shot.\nCheck the Google map for directions to the shelter located at 109 Commerce in Levelland, Texas.",

She was found on the side of the road in WV, very skinny and scared. Chilly has been at the shelter since the start of January and is having a hard time coming out of her shell, she is very reserved and nervous coming out of her crate but never aggressive. Chilly is covered in scars almost head to toe, this leads us to believe Chilly was not treated very nice her past life. We are hoping to find someone who has a quiet household (no other pets or young kids) to allow Chilly to come out of her shell. Once in a home I suspect Chilly will be a total love bug, its like she really wants to love she just doesn't know how! Will you consider opening your home up to this sweet shy girl?\n\nWe have a foster to adopt option which is a two week \"trial period\", we'd love for someone to take some time to get to know her! Can you help!?\n\nApply at: http://caninehumane.org/adoption-application/\n\nAdoption Fee is $350\nShe is up to date on vaccines and has had a wellness exam, heartworm tested and micro-chipped.\n\nApplications are required before meeting a dog. To fill out an application go to\n http://caninehumane.org/adoption-application/ \n\nIF THE DOG IS ON PETFINDER IT IS STILL AVAILABLE\n\nwww.caninehumane.org\n\n***BE SURE TO CHECK YOUR SPAM/PROMOTION EMAIL FOLDER FOR CHN RESPONSE TO YOUR APPLICATION***",

However, I love getting pet and having my human's attention just as much as I love running around. I'm learning how to walk on the leash like a proper lady and once I master that, I cannot wait to go exploring with you and to investigate all sorts of new smells. I'm seeking a family where I can be a part of their every day-to-day as well as all the special moments, too. I can get a little enthusiastic sometimes and vocally tell you all about it and I've also enjoyed spending time playing with other high-energy dogs like myself. Are you interested in seeing my big happy smile in person and think we would be a good match? If so, please contact my friends at HALO to schedule to meet me!",

She was surrendered to the shelter by her owner, along with QUEEN ; we are not sure why. She is very shy and has no obvious health problems. She was very scared of the leash, so we did get a picture or two, but we plan to get more later when she has adjusted better to being in the shelter. She did enjoy being petted and when I sat down with her, she crawled into my lap and licked my hand some. She should get more comfortable in a home where she can be shown some love and attention. With any of our dogs, it\u2019s a good idea for potential adopters with other dogs at home to bring them out to meet the potential adoptee dog before making a final decision. SAGE would make a great indoor/outdoor dog. She has short hair and will not tolerate cold weather very well. She should at least be allowed to sleep indoors and be brought in during cold, wet or stormy weather during the day if possible. She should have plenty of water and good shade if left outside in the summer. She would make a great companion for watching TV or just hanging out in the evenings and would love to be included in any family activities indoors or out whenever possible.\nSAGE is looking for another chance at a forever home.\nLevelland Animal Control is understaffed right now and adoptions are by appointment only. If you would like to meet SAGE for a possible adoption, please call (806) 891-0829 from 9 to 5, Monday through Friday; if (806) 891-0829 doesn\u2019t answer, call (806) 894-6164 and tell them you are interested in adopting a dog. You may need to refer to SAGE by her shelter number, D21-01001, when talking to an Animal Control employee.\nLevelland Animal Control is understaffed right now and adoptions are by appointment only.\nAll our dogs are vaccinated for Parvo, distemper, Bordetella (kennel cough) and most other common dog diseases. We do not vaccinate them for Rabies. There is no adoption fee, but the adopter will be responsible for having the dog spayed or neutered and for the Rabies shot.\nCheck the Google map for directions to the shelter located at 109 Commerce in Levelland, Texas.",

Foster mom says my most favorite thing in the world is to snuggle and she is right! I have been in my foster home with kids and they are my favorite. Playing with the resident dog is real fun too! I seen my first snow not to long ago and the resident dog and I played in the white stuff for hours it felt like. I wasn't to sure about it at first but that cold fluffy stuff is amazing. I am highly treat motivated and already know sit and lay down, teaching me a few more tricks will be easy. So what are you waiting for? Better get your application in right now. I won't be here long!\n\nJust fill out an application at www.pawsitivetailskc.org and come meet me! My adoption fee is $150 and I'm up to date on age appropriate vaccines, dewormed, current on preventatives, spayed and microchipped.",

MUR helped me after some good folks found me as I was lost and living all alone.\n\nI am happy to report I am not lonely anymore, and I know as soon as you lay eyes on me it will be instant love as I am such a good looking fellow. I am a pyrenees retriever mix, and I know that is where I get my golden flowing locks from.\n\nI have been working on my crate training and I understand how important this is so I am getting much more comfortable resting inside. I am fully house trained and love leash walks. I do get pretty excited when I see a car or other dogs and like to \u2018woof\u2019 at them. I am working on controlling my enthusiasm, but I will need your continued support. I know sit, leave it, and shake, and these are great skills to have.\n\nI have not been around a lot of cats or dogs with my foster family, but I am told I did good with my first introduction. I really enjoy treats, a good bone and walks with you. I like being with humans so much, I do find I get nervous when I am alone. \n\nMy foster describes me as loyal, loving, and energetic! What a great combination for a fellow as good looking as I am. Do you think you're the right home for a boy like me?\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Because we do not have a public shelter, an adoption application must be filled out in order to be approved to meet any of our animals available for adoption.

Oscars previous owner said he is a total lap dog and good snuggler! He was not crated in his previous home but he is taking to the crate well. He is house trained and knows basic tricks! \n\nAdoption Fee is $350.\n\nHe is heartworm positive but being treated, up to date on vaccines and has had a wellness exam, and micro-chipped.\n\nApplications are required before meeting a dog.

Sasha was found as a stray, clinging to a plastic bag containing Sasha's lifeless puppy. We don't know the life Sasha has had or the circumstances surrounding her puppy, but we do know that that life is over. We are rewriting Sasha's life and this time it will be happy, loving and kind. Sasha is a sweetheart who is going to bring so much happiness to her forever family.

Darla lived for her first 4 yrs in an outdoor kennel, and had not been on a leash her whole life.  We sent her to a trainer who got her leash ready for us in two weeks.  She has a brother, Charlie, that is still learning how to not balk and walk on a leash.  She was not abused, but more of a situation where she did not get the socialization she wanted.  Yet, the more time she spends at our center with our volunteers, she is wagging her tail and happy to see everyone.  A fenced yard would be ideal, as new sounds are somewhat scary to her.  She likes other dogs and would do really well with a confident dog that can show her, \"how to be a dog and enjoy things\".  She has lots of potential to overcome her fear and be a great companion dog.",

We are not doing adoptions to Canada at this time due to the border closure. We do not ship animals.\n\nOPHS is appointment only. All potential adopters must fill out an adoption application prior to setting up an appointment to meet the animal. An application can be found on our website https://www.ophumanesociety.org/dog-adoption-application\n\nWe have limited staff during this time, please allow 3-5 business days for us to process your application. We are screening the applications for the first BEST fit for each animal.\n\nIf you are approved, you will be contacted by us via phone or email to schedule an appointment.\n\nNAME: Estelle\nAGE: About 4 years old\nWEIGHT: 6.8lbs\nBREED(S):  Chihuahua\nREASON FOR ARRIVAL:  Transfer from CA\n\nGENERAL INFO ABOUT PERSONALITY: Estelle is as sweet as can be and is an absolute cuddle bug! She enjoys wearing warm sweaters when it is cold outside and she adores getting her belly rubbed. She will take short walks on a leash but also just loves being in your arms.\n\nEstelle loves being around people and is so full of love to give. Sometimes when she sees someone about to go in her kennel she lets out an excited squeak! \n\nEstelle is small and delicate like a cute little mouse, so around other dogs she is pretty insecure. She can be a bit grumpy with other dogs so she would definitely be happiest as the only spoiled dog in the house. \n\nActivity Level? Low\nTraining Needs? Low\nHouse Trained? Most likely\nLeash Trained? Yes\nComfortable with kids? Unknown\nComfortable with strangers? A little shy at first\nHistory with other dogs? Not so good.\nHistory with cats? Good fit\n\nAdditional MEDICAL notes: None\nAdditional BEHAVIOR notes: Has had chronic ear infections which will need to be managed.\n\nADOPTION FEE: $275 for a dog under 20lbs and up to 4 years.\n\nAdoption fee includes: Spay/neuter, initial vaccines, a microchip, rabies vaccine when appropriate, and one free veterinary visit with a local participating clinic.",

Due to their early starvation, they have some limb deformity, but they get around & play like any puppy and it doesn't seem to slow them down. We are hopeful that as they receive proper nutrition & TLC, as they grow their crooked legs will straighten out. Hilday is a growing female Hound mix pup born approximately 10-2-20. She is spayed, vaccinated, microchipped, given flea/tick preventive, dewormed & started on heartworm preventive. Adoption fee is $575 to help offset the many expenses we have for vetting costs. We rely strictly on adoption fees and donations to continue to save the lives of orphaned & abandoned pets; 100% goes towards their care. If interested in adopting one of our available dogs or puppies, please complete an online adoption application at https://dollyslegacyanimalrescue.org/adopt/ You will be contacted by our adoption coordinator via email after your application has been reviewed & approved to schedule an appointment.",

We will post more info as we get to know her.\n\nSeattle Foster Update:\nNala is doing pretty well!! She is very nervous around strangers and other dogs, but when introduced slowly, she does alright. She gets overwhelmed easily and is slow to trust, but once she does trust you, she's very cute and fun. She's sweet as can be, but is still learning how to play and do normal dog things. She could benefit from having a resident dog to show her the ropes, but would do best with a calm, confident dog. Nala does well in the crate and in the car and has done well being left home in her crate.\n\nNala is looking for a home that will help her gain some confidence, hopefully with another confident calm dog to teach her the rope and no small children. We think she would benefit from a quiet home and she isn't a downtown kind of girl.\n\nAdoption Info: Adoption fee is $500, which includes spay/neuter, current rabies/DAPPV/bordetella vaccinations, microchip, health certificate, and heartworm test. All adoption fees are donations to a Washington non-profit corporation and all donations go to benefit the animals in our rescue.\n\nApply online at www.DogGoneSeattle.org\n\nAnimal History: This dog was rescued from euthanasia at a high-kill shelter in California and will be available for adoption in Seattle, once evaluated in a loving foster home in the greater Seattle area.",

Green came into Rescue as part of the 34 dog hoarding case along with his Mon and 5 other siblings. Green was 10 days old when he came into Rescue. Shortly after he came to CTDR, he became very ill along with one of his siblings. They both ended up testing positive for parvo. Green's sibling did pass away after battling for several days and little Green fought so hard as our awesome vet staff almost had to make a decision on this little guy. All of a sudden Green turned the corner and bounced back to a healthy young puppy. He is now fully vetted after a delay and is ready for his forever home. He is a tiny little guy, weighing only 3.9 lbs. If interested in Green, you would need to complete an application at ctdr.org. GREEN MUST STAY IN THE AUSTIN AREA",

I am Sophia Sue, and I'm just about the most cuddly girl you could ever imagine! I'm considered special needs because I am deaf, but don't let that scare you. I am working really hard on learning hand signals for my commands. Right now we are working on sit and come. I'm also learning how to use a light marker to indicate when I'm doing things right! Good thing I like treats because they really help with my training. I will need a patient, loving family to help me until I get all this training stuff down. I'll return your love with lots of love of my own, snuggles, and kisses!\n\nI am potty trained and walk pretty nicely on a leash. I am working on crate training and learning to relax when I'm not in your sight. I promise I'm working hard at this, and giving me stuffed kongs really helps!\n\nI love to play (when I'm not sleeping) so I will definitely need exercise and mental enrichment. I love the kids I have met so far, though I haven't met any little little ones yet. At the moment, I can play a little roughly with the cats. Training may help, but for now I prefer a home without any feline siblings! I have made some dog friends but would also prefer to be the only dog in the home for now. I also think a fenced in yard would be helpful for my safety, but it\u2019s not required.\n\nPlease remember us deaf girls may take a bit to train but remember this. The ONLY THING a deaf dog CANNOT DO is hear.\n\nDo you think I might be the cuddle buddy that you need? Apply today!\n\n** As a member of the WGR Pitty Posse - all Pittys will be sent home with their very own Pitty Package!!\n\n***Please inquire ONLY online through our website at www.woofgangrescue.com***\n\nDATCP 402490",

Due to their early starvation, they have some limb deformity, but they get around & play like any puppy and it doesn't seem to slow them down. We are hopeful that as they receive proper nutrition & TLC, as they grow their crooked legs will straighten out. Havana is a female Collie mix pup born approximately 10-2-20. She is spayed, vaccinated, microchipped, given flea/tick preventive, dewormed & started on heartworm preventive. Adoption fee is $650 to help offset the many expenses we have for vetting costs. We rely strictly on adoption fees and donations to continue to save the lives of orphaned & abandoned pets; 100% goes towards their care. If interested in adopting one of our available dogs or puppies, please complete an online adoption application at https://dollyslegacyanimalrescue.org/adopt/ You will be contacted by our adoption coordinator via email after your application has been reviewed & approved to schedule an appointment.",

If you enjoy a loveable, playful, well tempered pup, he's the guy for you! Cash loves playing fetch, but also will cuddle up on the couch with you for snuggle time! \nCash does require a special diet that limits him to his dog food only, but he's happy with that since it prevents any stomach issues. He has had formal training and will happily engage in more.  Cash has lived with other dogs but a meet and greet would be needed to make sure it is a good match. He also has lived with kids with no issues but we always recommend an adjustment time with new kids in a home and mutual respect.

I had a home for my whole life, and they were very sad they had to let me go, but they knew I deserved better, so they surrendered me knowing I would find my perfect home. Im still a bit sad as well, but I'm sure once I find my new, forever home, that will help me feel a bit better. I lived with another dog in my last home, so it would be okay if I lived with another low-key, calm dog or two, who isn't in my face and can take cues from me when I tell them I'm not comfortable. I would do okay with teen-aged kids as well, but just like the dogs I could live with, they must be low-key and calm. I also think it's really fun to chase the cats out of the back yard at my foster home, so I shouldn't live with any. I'm completely house trained and am respectful of my home, so although I'm crate trained, foster mom says I don't have to be in one.\n\nListen, I really like to be around my humans, and maybe some of that is because I don't want to be left again, but I handle being alone pretty well if you need to go to work, or to the store. Foster mom says I'm down to earth, well behaved and loyal. I'd love to go in walks with you in the neighborhood so I can stay in shape, but I'm just as happy cuddling on the couch. I have some allergies, but they are easily managed and I get a bi-weekly bath, which I tolerate, as long as I get to snuggle with you afterwards. We could use that time to look deep into each other's eyes and learn all about each other! \n\nAlbert's Dog Lounge is a transporting dog rescue, meaning that we rescue many of our dogs from high kill shelters in areas of dog overpopulation. We are a specialty rescue focusing primarily on senior and special needs dogs.  The vast majority of our dogs come from the Houston, TX area where we have an entire team of volunteers, coordinators, and fosters. We do also work with local shelters, rescues, and owners.  If you apply for a dog that is currently in our local Houston program, we will work to get your dog transported to WI as quickly as possible. We ask that you have patience during this time of uncertainty and unprecedented dog adoptions nationwide. \n\nLearn more about Albert's Dog Lounge, our mission, and adoption policies by visiting Albertsdoglounge.org. \n\nOur process includes an approved application, reference checks, a homevisit, and then a meet and greet with the dog. Adoption fee is $275.\n\nBegin your application process by copying this link into your web browser: https://www.albertsdoglounge.org/apply\n\nWI Dept. Of Agriculture License Number: 474085-DS",

I am neutered, heartworm treated, current on shots, micro-chipped and on flea/heartworm prevention.  I have also had a negative fecal.  My adoption is $300.\n\nI was found as a stray and no one claimed me.  Unfortunately, I tested positive for heartworms but luckily, the rescue has treated me.   I will need to be retested in April 2021.  If still positive, which should be unlikely, the rescue will have their vet continue with any care for the heartworms.  Therefore, I must be adopted locally to the Altamonte Springs/Orlando area.  I also have a sensitive stomach and need to eat a particular food or else I will get an upset tummy.\n\nI am a sweet boy, most of the time.  However, I do have an attitude.  I will guard my possessions and will bite if I don't want you to take it.  Also, I will tolerate being brushed/groomed but once I am done, I am done.  If you do not heed my warning, I will bite.  I am also pushy/bossy with other dogs.\n\nI need an adopter that is experienced with small dog aggression.  I would make a great companion for the right person.\n\nPlease email for an adoption application.  Once the application is approved, we will arrange for you to meet and adopt. \n\nWe do not adopt out of state.\nDue to many bounced checks, we now require that adoption donations be cash only.  However, if you make a general donation to the organization (not associated with the adoption of a pet) we do accept checks and paypal.  If you are unable to adopt right now, won't you please make a donation to help care for the pets?  THANK YOU!!",

He is neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, given flea/tick preventive, dewormed & started on heartworm preventive. Adoption fee is $575 to help offset the many expenses we have for vetting costs. We rely strictly on adoption fees and donations to continue to save the lives of orphaned & abandoned pets; 100% goes towards their care.

I\u2019m Zips, a special needs girl with partial paralysis of the rear legs. True to my name, I can zip around the house both in and out of my doggie wheelchair! My favorite things include snuggles and stuffed toys. I love collecting them and hiding them from the other dogs in the house. I\u2019m great with kids and adults, as well as other dogs. I\u2019ve never met a cat, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019d be ok with them. Because of my paralysis I need to be diapered and have daily baths but I will come with some washable diapers that have been working well on me. I am crate trained, and I also sleep quietly all night in my crate. I cannot do stairs on my own so I need a family that is willing to modify their house if necessary with gates to ensure my safety. I promise lots of love and snuggles to my forever family.\n\n***Please inquire ONLY through our website: www.woofgangrescue.com***\n\nDATCP 402490",

Zuki is only 1.5 years old and she has already experienced a lifetime's worth of suffering. This beautiful girl was abused as a breeding machine while all of her basic needs were neglected. Her skin is so infected that her hair has fallen out and the skin is raw and oozing, but Zuki is now receiving all of the medical care she requires. We are turning Zuki's life around, and she is leaving her past in the past. Zuki's future is bright and happy and safe, and she can't wait to start that life.

            "description": "We are looking for a foster-to-adopt home for this beautiful boy.\n\nMikka is a gorgeous, highly intelligent 8-year old black shepherd looking for a special home.  Mikka did not receive adequate socialization in his previous life, so he is now learning what is expected of him. Given the time to learn and observe, Mikka is blossoming.  He is slowly getting used to having more freedom than he has been used to, and is enjoying the gradual approach. He is making new human friends at the shelter and is ready to be in a home. Although initially fearful/anxious, Mikka appears to be able to quickly form positive relationships with familiar and unfamiliar people with proper introductions. Mikka is a large dog and has hyperextension in both front and back legs.  His new home will ideally provide soft bedding and keep his weight on the lower side due to arthritis.  He will need a dog saavy and patient family, ideally with German Shepherd experience, to be successful.  In particular, his family needs to be willing and able to establish routines, and keep a keen eye on how Mikka responds to everything in life.\n\nMikka doesn\u2019t enjoy car rides.  His activity level is low to moderate.  He is sweet, sensitive, curious, and he is learning to be silly.  He is enjoying learning about clicker training.\n\nMikka was assessed by a behavioral veterinarian, who provided these recommendations:\n\u2022\tQuiet, adult only home \n\u2022\tSlow, gradual introductions with new people and environments.  It will be important to give Mikka time needed when acclimating in a new environment and towards new people.\n\u2022\tOther animals possible although caution and slow introductions are needed.  He doesn\u2019t have a lot of experience with other dogs, so for now at least, he needs to be the only dog in a home.  We are unsure about cats.\n\u2022\tPositive reinforcement training for clear communication and behavior modification \n\nWe believe that Mikka will be a spectacular companion, given the right home and circumstances.  \n\nPLEASE NOTE - We will check your veterinary reference, to ensure that current and prior pets have a history of being kept up to date on vaccines, annual exams and recommended bloodwork. We also do home checks to make sure that your home environment meets the needs of the particular animal you are interested in.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adoption, please fill out our online adoption survey at https://www.olddogsnewdigs.com/adoption-survey/. We are partnering with PAWS Brave Hearts in Calais to find the right home for Mikka.  You can contact them by email: info@pawsbravehearts.org or phone:  207-4547662.\n\n\n",

Don't let her mask fool you, Vanda has nothing to hide. She's housebroken and loves all people as well as all the doggos - she'd even love to have her very own doggie siblings! Vanda attends daycare and she is every dog's favorite playmate. She's energetic, loving all things hiking, running around, and playing (she ADORES toys), and she loves going on car rides. At the end of her busy day, Vanda loves to curl up with her people and dream of tomorrow's adventures. Apply for Vanda and fulfill her dream of a furever home of her own.\n\nVanda is under 2 years old and weighs about 55 pounds.\n\nIf you're interested in meeting Vanda, please visit our website to learn about our adoption process and to fill out an application, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs and cats will be micro-chipped, spayed or neutered, and up-to-date on vaccinations at the time of adoption. For more photos of Vanda, follow us on Facebook Gateway Pet Guardians and Instagram @gatewaypets ... #gpgvanda.\n\nTo view other adoptable pets from our shelter, please visit, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nGateway Pet Guardians is proud to offer a variety of mixed breed dogs available for adoption. However, please keep in mind that we rarely know the genetic background of the animals we rescue and, as such, we cannot guarantee the exact breed combinations found within this dog. However, we do not know his/her actual genetic makeup. Just know that this dog is probably a variety of several different breeds that have combined to create one very amazing and unique animal.",

I had a mammary tumor (because I wasnt spayed) and I still have several masses on me but they are mostly fatty. I was sitting there at the shelter and no one was even looking at me. I guess because I have these lumps I wasnt pretty enough. If only they would look past that and see what a great girl I am. I am active and fun and I get along great with everyone. I dont hear well (maybe even deaf) but that doesnt stop me from being a great companion.\n\nPlease note: We only adopt in Florida. All current pets must be spayed/neutered and up to date on vaccinations AND heartworm prevention in order for your application to be considered. All adoption fees go to help all the pets in our rescue, many of which require extensive medical care. Thank you for caring for the greater good.",

Please look into heartworm treatment in dogs before applying. We have a few options for adoption for him as he has a lengthly treatment plan which requires much work on any new adoptors part, luckily he is non symptomatic and able to have a somewhat active lifestyle while in treatment but, is not out of the woods yet.\n\n He also has some behavior hiccups that he is also working through, but he is so willing to learn he is flying through his training! He is looking for a home with a strong GSD background and very knowledgeable of the breed that will be able to have training classes with a professional set up after adoption so he can continue his progress! He gets along great with other dogs and when it comes to cats hes a big scared baby if they swat at him. He loves to snuggle and be as close to his person as he can! He is currently in a foster and attends doggy darcare everyday and gets glowing reviews!\n\nCasper would require a 6 ft fenced in yard\n\nIF you are Casper's perfect match let us know! Please head on over to all4animalsrescue.org and fill out an application and we can set up a time for you to meet!",

Bella is an athletic girl, jumping around when excited, then settling to play with stuffed toys that squeak or a bone. Strongly motivated by food, she's learned sit, down and stay. Bella walks well with a special collar as she shows her strength when she sometimes lunges. She loves to play with her 75 LB foster sister. Bella is crate trained. A home with older children and a similar size dog would be good for Bella.

She loves to romp in the snow and we have a hard time getting her to come inside when the fluffy white stuff is falling from the sky. In perfect Shepard fashion she likes to have conversations with anyone that will listen. You talk and she talks back like she knows exactly what you are saying. Shes a bit shy but warms up quickly and is still working on her confidence. She is doing really well at potty training and I know she will get there soon. She will need someone to snuggle her and even though shes working on kennel training she prefers a warm spot on the couch or bed. She will make the ultimate companion for someone willing to spend time and energy training this sweet and smart pup.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit our website and complete an adoption application at www.elpasocountycanine.org/adopt",

She is the ultimate snuggle bug with a heart of gold. She is a bit needy at the moment as most 8 week old puppies are, and I know her confidence will get there with training and attention. She is a snow dog and loves to romp in in it! She prefers to lay on top of her human more than a kennel. She is very vocal when shes in the kennel and we are working on that. Heck shes a shepard so she talks a lot, unless you are giving her cuddles and hug. She will make the best pup for someone familiar with the breed or looking she the best cuddle buddy!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit our website and complete an adoption application at www.elpasocountycanine.org/adopt",

I have been learning all about living in a house. My foster mom says I have made great progress. I was really scared and shy at first but over time I have come around. I need a family that will give me time, patience, and training. I am still learning. I finally am able to be a dog so I am curious about everything.\n\nWhen I first came to my foster home, I wasn't too sure about kids. Little kids' movements and loudness startled me, but over time I have come to realize they are my friend. I love playing with my tiny foster humans and they also give me treats.\n\nI have been around other dogs and I do great, so I know having another dog around will be fine. I am doing great with potty training especially after learning where the back door is. I do have quiet crate time and also love just laying in my crate during the day. If you think I could be part of your family please apply today!\n\n***Please inquire ONLY through our website: www.woofgangrescue.com***\n\nDATCP 402490",

She has already been spayed, and is ready to go.\n\nAdoption fee for Dogs is $100, which includes microchip. All of our dogs and puppies have been examined by a veterinarian, de-wormed,  vaccinated, treated for fleas and ticks, spayed or neutered and  tested for heartworms (If 6 months of age and over) and are on monthly heartworm preventative.  Puppies too young to be spayed/neutered require a refundable $50 deposit which will be returned upon proof of spay/neuter. If this is done at our vet (Allen's in Parsons), there is no charge for the spay/neuter. Give us a call at 620-421-0445 or e-mail us at pals@wavewls.com today to find out more about this pet.",

Our veterinary partner estimates that Arlo is 9 months old at the time of intake in January 2021. Arlo is good with people and other dogs. This poor little guy was hit by a car, sustaining several fractures. Rather than provide the medical care Arlo required as a result of his injuries, his owner opted to euthanize him. That's when Rescue Dogs Rock NYC stepped in and said NO WAY! Arlo is an adorable, sweet pup who doesn't deserve to die, so we took him in and he has now received the surgery he required to put his leg back together. Arlo is now looking for a new home. If you would like to be Arlo's forever family, please apply online to adopt Arlo (TX) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\nBeignet (TX) is a female Australian Shepherd/Great Pyrenees mix rescued in Texas. Our veterinary partner estimates that Beignet is 4 weeks old at the time of intake in January 2021. Beignet is good with people of all ages and other dogs. Beignet is a beautiful, sweet pup who is very lucky to be alive. She was found clinging to her lifeless Momma on the side of the road where her Momma landed after having been hit by a car. Beignet is just a baby and could not have survived on her own. Fortunately, an Animal Control Officer picked Beignet up, and rather than take her to the kill shelter where her life would have come to end because she needed to be bottle fed, the Animal Control Officer diverted Beignet to rescue. And now Beignet is not only being bottle fed, but she will be given a fabulous future in a wonderful forever home. If you are looking for a playful, happy, gorgeous four legged pup, Beignet is your girl! Please apply online to adopt Beignet (TX) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

            "description": "Lacey was transferred to Valley Humane on 12/31 along with her 10 puppies from Stockton Animal Services. She had been surrendered by her owner. Lacey weighs 67 pounds and is estimated to be between 4 and 7 years old. Lacey has undergone a lot of major changes over the past few months including raising her puppies and recently being separated from them as they are adopted. She is looking for a very patient owner who can give her the time and space to further acclimate and adjust.\n\nLacey is an extremely smart dog, with the grace and body of a gazelle. She is gentle, very sweet, and people-oriented. Lacey is cautious initially but with lots of love, patience, and consistency will become more confident and comfortable, making her an amazing companion. In no time she'll be rolling over for tummy rubs, shaking hands with her graceful paws, and following you like a sleek shadow. \n\nIt is incredibly helpful that Lacey knows her name and responds very well to it. She is very responsive to a calm voice and there is no need to ever yell or loudly correct her. This girl is built for running and galloping and loves chasing balls and squeaky toys. Lacey loves her toys and playing with her \"person\" outside or inside. She is well-behaved indoors, with no accidents. She is taken outside to go potty every few hours during the day but sleeps through the night. She loves going on long walks, but has limited experience on a leash and will require more practice with a patient and attentive walker. She currently puts herself to sleep in an extra-large wire crate in the same room with us. She can walk in and out of the crate and it provides her with her own private space. It has a large blanket draped over three sides and a soft dog bed and towels inside. \n\nLacey should be placed with someone who is experienced with dogs and who can patiently and consistently work with her to bring out her confidence, silliness, and even more loving personality. She is very smart and learns quickly. She would do well in a calm household with people who are active and can spend time with her outdoors playing and enjoying long walks or hikes.\n\nThis dog is currently being treated for an ear infection in both ears. When she arrived at VHS, she had evidence of chronic ear infections that were previously untreated (especially in the right ear). Due to the chronicity and lack of previous treatment, the right ear pinna is thickened and no longer stands upright. Ear infections are common in dogs. They are not contagious to humans or to other dogs. This dog appears to be prone to ear infections and may develop them frequently through out her lifetime, requiring treatment by a veterinarian and regular care by her adoptive family. A long acting ear treatment was placed into both ears on 1/7/21 and repeated on 1/22/21. The adopting family must be willing to seek appropriate follow-up veterinary care by their veterinarian. If her right ear does not respond to appropriate therapy, the adopting family's veterinarian may recommend a consultation for a possible surgical intervention. Any further medical expenses sought out after adoption will be at the cost of the adopter.\n\nDuring shelter-in-place, Valley Humane is conducting adoptions by appointment only. If you would like to adopt Crescent, please complete an Adoption Inquiry Form (copy and paste the following URL into your browser), https://valleyhumane.org/adoption/adoption-inquiry-form/\n\nAn adoption counselor will reach out via telephone to conduct an adoption interview. Once you have submitted your application, stand by to answer our call! Animals posted to the website are ready to go home and applicants are typically called the same day as the Inquiry Form is received.\n\nIf approved, we will schedule an adoption appointment for you, your family and the animal at our facility in Pleasanton.\n\nhttps://valleyhumane.org/safe-adoption-guidelines/",

He seems to be house trained and loves a comfy spot to take a nap. He really enjoys walks and is great on the leash. He doesnt know any commands but is very food motivated and picked up sit in just a few days. He is still unsure and timid with new situations/people/dogs/noises but he gains confidence each day. Once he is comfortable he is playful and has a puppy like curiosity. He is such a wonderful, handsome boy! Shy at first, but with tasty food, a comfy place to lay and some tlc he will settle right in.\n\nHW+ simply means the dog has tested positive for heart worms in our screening process. We utilize what is called the fast-kill method which means we place the dog on antibiotics for 30 days and then administer 3 injections in increments afterward. The cost to treat heart worms is rather steep. However, thanks to our generous donors, we are able to cover that cost for our adopters so long as they go to our veterinarian, Red Rocks Animal Center in Lakewood.\n\n\n\tApproved Applicants may make the adoption fee payment by clicking donate above. Partial adoption fees will not hold a dog.\n\tDogs adopted with our rescue come with FREE training from #GoodPup to help you build strong bonds from the start!\n\tIf upon meeting the dog of your choosing at an adoption event you find that you aren't a good match, your deposit will be refunded minus a 10% administration fee.\n\tAdoption fees include vaccines up until time of adoption, microchip, spay/neuter and 1st 30 days of free Pet insurance. We are not affiliated with Pet First pet insurance. (you have to sign up for the insurance or it will not go into effect). \n\tAdopters can go to our vet for medical issues that may arise in 1st 3 days of adoption. \n\tThe dogs in our care are fostered in Colorado, Texas, and New Mexico. While all dogs are picked up during our scheduled times, sometimes transport dates change due to unforeseen circumstances.",

            "description": "Hi, my name is Hermoine (I go by Hermie). I like cold nights by the fire, a warm fluffy blanket, morning belly rubs, scooby snacks, squeaky toys, big ole bones and going on walks/jogs with my person. Favorite times of the day are breakfast and dinner. Nothing better than a great meal and a nice nap afterward.\n\nIm pretty much potty trained, and I know how to sit like a lady. Im 3-years-old and about 27 pounds - just right for my height and body type. While Im mostly a house-dog, I like my time outdoors as well. I rarely bark when outdoors and enjoy watching the squirrels run across the fence. I never dig as it gets my nails dirty. One of my favorite things is walking/jogging in the neighborhood. Neighbors marvel at my leash skills.\n\nSo everyone has a story. Mine isnt so great. I was rescued from a pretty bad situation with two other dogs. We obviously weren't Weimaraners but WRT couldn't just leave us in the situation we were in (there are several pictures posted here of my \"before\" look). WRT DNA tested us and I'm 37.5% Beagle, 25% Labrador, 12.5% Amstaff, and 25% Sporting Breed group. We all had a variety of worms (including heart worms) and mange. So, Imwell, Im bald. Im getting some hair now, but it seems to take FOREVER to grow back. But for a bald girl, Im pretty cute!\n\nIt takes time for me to trust people. But I definitely bonded with my foster mom. She has another dog a beagle/basset. Im not very good with sharing, and would really prefer to be an only dog. Her dog is friendly enough, but it seems like every time her dog wants something, I want it too. Envy is one of the seven deadly sinsthats what my foster mom says. Anyway, I want to be specialan only dog.\n\nWhile Im guilty of getting into occasional tussles with my foster brother, I NEVER bite. Thats just not my thing. Panic maybe, bitenever. So Im looking for that special person with patience and kindness, someone that lets me lick the plate every now and then . I hope thats you!\n\nI'm being fostered in the San Antonio area if you'd like to meet me.",

            "description": "This boy is a lover! His foster mom says he is such a great doggie - he is gentle with her many cats,quickly made friends with her other dogs, plays with her pre-teen son, and is a world class snuggler. Goofy and a fun boy to have around. Smart too! Bart learned to sit patiently while his breakfast and dinner are being prepared and to wait for mom's que to begin eating. At 4-5 months old and 40 lbs, Bart is going to be large as adult. Guesses on his breed include Border Collie / Anatolian Shepherd / Great Pyr/ maybe a little American Staffordshire Terrier? He is on his way to being housetrained and already sleeps contently through the night in his crate. Sweet boy!!\n\nThe vet said that given Bart's larger size it is important for him to not jump in and out of vehicles or other high objects. The rescue will be providing a loading ramp for him to make car rides easier.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Bart please complete an application at https://www.circle2rescue.com/dog-adoption-application/ The adoption fee of $300 includes spay/neuter, vaccinations, microchip and dewormer.\n\nPlease note, Circle 2 Rescue cannot guarantee the breed, composition or ages of our dogs as we usually have limited history prior to them entering the rescue. We make every effort to ensure the dogs are healthy.",

Fast forward just a few months and he's in great health, has a beautiful grey coat and is loving life! Auguste adores the children he lives with, doesn't bother the cats and plays nicely with other dogs. He's house, crate and leash trained, does well in the bath and the car and is all around pretty \"low maintenance\". He is also very eager to please his people (and very treat motivated). This very handsome good boy may be older but he is full of tail wags, cuddles and has plenty of life left to live with his forever family. Auguste is up to date on age appropriate vaccinations, neutered, and microchipped. His adoption fee is $175.\nAll of our dogs are spayed or neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccinations, microchipped and if over 6 months of age, heartworm tested and on heartworm preventative in their foster home.\n\nWe require an approved application to meet any of our dogs. We do not have a shelter location and will not arrange a meeting without an approved application.\n\nWe strive to make sure the bios provided for our dogs are complete and accurate; we do understand that mistakes happen, however, so if you absolutely cannot find the answer to your question in the dog's bio, you can contact us for more information.\n\nWe require a home visit for each dog we adopt out, so we adopt within a 2 hour radius of Dayton, OH. If you are outside of this radius, we encourage you to contact your local rescue or shelter.",

            "description": "Are you looking for a low-maintenance, go with the flow, kind of girl? The kind who loves ear scratches and short walks? Margo is your gal!\n\nMargo is a sweet, gentle lab mix, a small town girl who once roamed her hometown, visiting the local grocery store where the employees fed her before finding herself at an animal shelter and finally to Muddy Paws.\n\nMargo is excellent with cats, dogs and children. Though she is sweet and cuddly, she walks well on a leash, has plenty of pep in her step and loves car rides! Margo had surgery to remove benign mammary tumors and a cyst from her neck and is healing well. Margo is the sweetest girl and needs a great home to give her lots of love for her remaining years.\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Margo is $250. We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes.\n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

Some nice people took me in and gave me a safe place to have my puppies (who are also available to adopt through Polk County Humane Society). Now I'm getting spayed and I'm ready for a life of no more babies, just me and my new family! I do great with kids and other dogs, so I'd be easy to fit right into your family. I weigh 71 pounds, but I'm a gentle girl. To meet me, please fill out my adoption application at: https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/1369/generic. The nice people here will give you a call with any questions and if it looks like a fit, they will set up an appointment for us to meet!",

            "description": "Personality: Beckett is an athletic, energetic dog who is looking for a dog savvy home that is just as athletic as he is. He can be a little tentative in new places and can be sensitive to invasive handling, but with some time and space to settle in, he warms up quickly. His future family should be familiar with dog body language and reading his signals to help him slowly build confidence. He loves to have access to a yard where he gets more space to meet people, but he likes long walks, runs, and hikes even better! He would do best in an adult household with experience around working breeds like him. \n\nHistory: Beckett came to HSSV as a stray.\n\nDog/Cat Skills: Beckett has participated in dog playgroup, and can be forward in greets. He has shown to be tentative with and possibly target intact/recently neutered male dogs (not uncommon as he was only recently neutered as well). Beckett does best with social, playful females who tolerate his forward approach. He will play chase and enjoys running around the yard with dogs. He has shown hyper focus on cats and willingness to chase them. Adopters should be familiar with breed tendencies. \n\nLeash Skills: Beckett can pull on leash, but needs time to get comfortable before being harnessed. He walks okay on leash once he can get some energy out. Beckett is eager to meet dogs, and can become excited and vocal when he sees them. We are working on this by redirecting him with treats and happy talk. \n\nReady to meet Beckett?

She will need structure to continue working on her manners, but she is funny and loves people.\n\nDiamond adores playing with other dogs, but she has no concept of personal space, so could be annoying to them. She would probably like to chase cats and is a little to rambunctious for small children. She is not a fan of the crate, but does better when it is covered. She does still have accidents inside it, and sometimes in the house when she is focused on playing. She will need to work on her leash skills. She does best on chicken-free food as it appeared to cause skin irritation.\n\n\nPlease Note: All dogs currently available for adoption are posted on our website. If you cannot find a particular dog on our website, he/she may be on a temporary foster hold. All dogs are otherwise posted until they are officially adopted. This dog may have other interested adopters in line. If you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application.",

She is such a sweet and affectionate dog who just wants to be near her humans. She has LOVED going on walks and once she discovered snow it was game over - zoomie central. She is great in her kennel at the rescue and seems to do well around other low-key pups but we will do more dog testing once she is officially off of mama duty with her puppy Wombat in a few weeks. \n\n**Mombat is heartworm positive. ALIVE Rescue handles the scheduling and covers the cost of the heartworm treatment - all we ask of her adopters is to provide a comfy, cozy place for her during those months so she can recover safely. \n\nEst.

            "description": "Angela is an adorable 7-year-old female Shih Tzu that weighs 9 pounds. She is a sweet gal that loves to lounge outside in the sunshine, curl up next to her person for snuggle time, and enjoys the company of other dogs. Angela is doing great with potty training and we are confident she will do well with a consistent routine. She is laid back, friendly, and super sweet! She had to be shaved due to heavy matting, but we know her fur will grow back and be beautiful once again soon. Sadly, Angela is heartworm positive and currently undergoing the slow kill method with oral medication. Our rescue will provide the medication needed for 12 months. She is spayed, vaccinated, fecal negative, and microchipped, She is $350 plus TX sales tax with an approved application: www.recycledpomsbcs.com/adopt\n\nTexas law requires that all humane organizations (Rescues, SPCA's, Humane Societies, State nonprofit, and charitable 501c3 exempt orgs) collect and remit sales and use tax to the Texas Comptroller on their adoption fees.\n\nWe do not ship or transport our dogs. We require all adopters to meet the dog in person to ensure it is a good fit. We represent the dog to the best of our ability and since they are in rescue, we do not always get their history.\n\nPlease note: We are a non-profit Pomeranian Rescue with dogs in private foster homes. We do not have a facility open to the public. We require an approved application before a potential adopter is introduced to a dog. We contact vet references to ensure animals in the home are current on vaccinations, heart worm prevention, and sterilization. We do not adopt our dogs to homes in which an animal is not spayed or neutered. A home visit may be required.\n\nPlease visit our website for more information and an adoption application. www.recycledpomsbcs.com",

            "description": "Camilla was rescued from Korea!\n\nSince she was rescued overseas, adoption donations will include the expenses incurred, such as international travel costs, etc. estimated around $1200.\n\n\nShe has been a hilarious delight since she stepped off the plane.\n\n\nShe is loving and spirited. Despite the language barrier, she can sit for treats! She is a playful girl who would do well in a home with a play-partner-in-residence. The dog sibling should be her emotional equal - Camilla can been bossy and possessive with your affection.\n\n\nShe  is cuddly with people and pups. She loves to bomb around a park with a  soccer ball or similar-sized ball.  Beware anyone with a chuck-it!  She will leap to grab it, she is obsessed with them! She will not be denied- she jumps well! \n\n\nShe walks well on leash. She is learning manners everyday and is a good student. She very much wants to please. A tired Camilla is a  better roommate - in her foster home she gets 3-4 good plays and romps a  day.\n\n\nHer history is that she has terrible separation anxiety and is willful. She  has quickly relaxed and enjoyed the routine and residents in her foster  home. She is potty trained and respectfully sleeps at the foot of the bed!\n\n\nShe  is most potty trained, but expect an adjustment period that should pass  quickly.   She should be taken right outside in the morning and don't  let her save her poop for inside!  She likes to poop off-leash.\nIF INTERESTED, PLEASE FILL OUT AN ADOPTION APPLICATION ON OUR WEBSITE: https://www.wonderdogrescue.org/adoption-application\n\nAs  for eating, like with most dogs, everyone should have good space  around their food bowl. AND  longer lasting chewies/bones should be  carefully managed to maintain harmony between residents!\n\nSHE LOVES HOSES and baths.\n\n\nShe  will start sleeping by your head....but when she feels secure - will  move to the foot of the bed or to your side.  She is not great in the  car - she wants to be in your lap - so need to secure her in the back  seat with a leash.\n\n\nHer foster has not used a crate with her. It hasn't been necessary.",

            "description": "Its sweet momma Tallulah's turn to find her happily ever after. She is almost 2 years old, and likely a boxer, pittie and shepherd mix of sorts. This endearing momma\nwas picked up off the streets while being very pregnant on November 17th of 2020. She was rescued from the shelter on Thanksgiving day and two days later she gave birth to 10 puppies, all who have been adopted now! With having no knowledge of her true background, her foster family showered Tallulah with love and grace. For the birth of her babies, foster mom and her two daughters helped to midwife Tallulah which secured her trust in people. Over the past 8 weeks, Tallulah has gone from scared and not knowing hardly anything about being in a house, to knowing the love that is shared in a home. Her foster mom truly believes that Tallulah has learned a great deal from having a calm and confident alpha in the house and she is so thankful for love and fun! Tallulah is 75% lover of cough snuggles and cheese, 25% lover of outside play and runs. She is great with other dogs and with children. She is a shoe thief, so keep a look out. She has never destroyed a pair, but her foster family does make sure to put them away in the closet. She is house trained for the most part. If you go past 10 hours over night she *may have an accident. This has happened maybe twice in the past month. She truly sees no value in the command \"sit\" but is 100% spot on with \"come\" and \"leave it.\" She does well with boundaries. She is happiest outside running and playing with our other dogs and children. Of note, she does like to nibble at times when really playing, so for that reason, we feel she would not do well with small children as that might scare them. Tallulah is a sweet girl with a lot of love and fun to offer her furever family. Send your application in today at www.underhoundrailroad.org.\n\nTallulah is currently being fostered in North Carolina and may transport North to her furever home.",

Our veterinary partner estimates that Thibodeaux is 4 weeks old at the time of intake in January 2021. Thibodeaux is good with people of all ages and other dogs. This stunning little pup was found clinging to his lifeless Momma's body after she was hit by a car and left on the side of the road. Thibodeaux cheated death twice that day as when Thibodeaux was picked up by Animal Control, the Animal Control Officer diverted him to rescue rather than bringing Thibodeaux to the shelter where his life would likely have ended upon arrival. Thibodeaux is being bottle fed and well cared for in his foster home, but he is looking forward to the new happy, safe life we promised him in his very own forever home. Thibodeaux is a happy, playful, cuddly pup. If Thibodeaux is the pup you're looking to add to your family, or to start your family, please apply online to adopt Thibodeaux (TX) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

I am also fully crate trained and don't mind being in the crate for several hours at a time throughout the day. I'm not at all food driven, I just want all of the love you will give me.\n\nI know most of the basic commands (sit, lay down) but am still working on impulse control and staying in one place. I love to be around people I know and even love to meet new people. Sometimes I scare people with my bark when we first meet, but I warm up to people really quickly. I have played with many different dogs with no problems but I'm still a puppy, so sometimes I can be a little too much for older dogs. I do really well with playing with only the toys that I know are ok for me to play with and I love when I can chew on bones.\n\nI get around really well with three legs (please scroll through the pictures of my bio to read through my journey!) and am working on learning how to run. Don't worry, when I see a squirrel, I can pick up and GO! I need a little more down time, but I'm almost ready to start going on walks. I haven't tried stairs just yet since I've been healing from my surgery, but my foster mom is sure I would do great with a little assistance and training. (Please note that at some point in the future I may need to have a hip replacement. At this point in time we aren't sure of if or when it would be needed).\n\nI would do really well in a house where my parents will continue my training. My foster mom says I can be a little stubborn--I like to talk back when I'm frustrated or when she won't let me do something I want to do. I love kids and am very gentle but I am still working on not being so mouthy. I love to learn new things and just like many GSDs, I like to be wherever my people are. My foster mom says she can't wait to find me a home that I can call my own because she knows I will make someone a perfect companion!\n\nI am being fostered near Charlotte, NC.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting me, please reach out to your adoption coordinator. If you do not have an adoption coordinator, please fill out an adoption application at https://freedomgermanshepherdrescue.org",

She has proven to be such a good dog. She is doing great with her potty training and will be fully vaccinated this week so she can start some leash training. She has been doing great with \"Sit\" and she is learning \"Stay\", \"Come\", \"Lay\" (to lay down), \"Over here\", and of course her name.\n\nHer foster mama is taking good care of her and has shared these updates: She has been out for walks with me carrying her until she gets fully vaccinated so she has been able to get some fresh air and outside time. She barks when she meets new people and quiets down once she smells them and enjoys interacting with them. She does fantastic in the car. She is full of energy when initially in the car and settles down to sleep when the car starts moving. She has learned to cuddle and loves it. She has exhibited some separation anxiety but it is helped with the treat toys.\n\nIf you live in the San Diego or surrounding areas and think Pepper will be a good addition to your family please inquire to receive an application.",

We don\u2019t know Liam\u2019s exact age but we estimate he is about 5-6 years older. Liam is a gentle, sweet boy looking to leave his old life behind. He has done well meeting other dogs. Liam walks well on leash but doesn\u2019t know any commands. Liam hasn\u2019t been around children but we think he\u2019d be good with older children. Liam rides well in the car and has no issues with handling. We are excited for this sweet boy to start his new life and we know he\u2019ll continue to come out of his shell.\n\nIf interested in adopting, apply at www.gsrescue1.org. An application is the first step in our process. We only adopt local to Chicagoland.",

Not only am I potty trained, but I'm also such a good boy that I can free roam the house on my own when you're not there. Just make sure you close the trash because I do love me some snacks. I have lived with cats and other dogs and I did very well! I love to go for short walks, snuggle in your lap, or take a nice cozy nap by crawling under some blankets. I am looking for a calm, adult only forever home and I can't wait to meet you! Call The Humane Society of Southern Wisconsin at 608-752-5622 to schedule your meet and greet!",

I am spayed, heartworm negative, current on shots, micro-chipped and on flea/heartworm prevention.  My adoption is $400.\n\nI was given up by my owners because I was being kept outside in the yard and I can escape if left alone.  I can also be a bit shy with new people or settings.  I am crate trained and do well going on walks.\n\nWhen I first came into rescue, I had a tick borne illness called Ehrlichiosis that makes it hard for my blood to clot.  However, I have been treated and retested and I am now negative.\n\nPlease email for an adoption application.  Once the application is approved, we will arrange for you to meet and adopt. \n\nWe do not adopt out of state.\nDue to many bounced checks, we now require that adoption donations be cash only.  However, if you make a general donation to the organization (not associated with the adoption of a pet) we do accept checks and paypal.  If you are unable to adopt right now, won't you please make a donation to help care for the pets?  THANK YOU!!",

Inquiries requesting additional information will not be returned, due to limited volunteers. Thank you for your understanding ****\n\nMeet Chucky.\n\nChucky is being returned to our rescue, along with his sister Annabelle, due to their family being relocated to Australia for work.\n\nHe is estimated to have been born in June 2019, making him just over 1.5 years old. He is house broken, walks well on a leash, has moved past the chewing stage for the most part, is up to date on his vaccinations, spayed, microchipped, and is good with all people and other dogs.\n\nHe had not been cat tested.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAll PETronus Rescue dogs receive basic vaccinations (distemper/parvo, bordetella, & rabies), spay/ neuter, and microchip prior to adoption. We also treat any know medical issues, including heartworms.\n\nOur dogs live in foster homes while they wait patiently for their forever families to find them. This is beneficial in that they learn house manners, crate training, housebreaking, etc while they wait and we are also able to get a very realistic picture of their energy level, temperament, etc so that we can place them in a home that is the best fit.\n\nOur adoption fees are $200 for dogs over 1 year of age and $250 for dogs under 1 year of age. Puppies receive 3 rounds of puppy vaccinations.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our amazing dogs, please fill out our adoption application here http://bit.ly/PRAdoption and we will be in touch!\n\n",

My foster Mom says I\u2019m a really fast learner, especially with house training (no one ever taught me!) At first I liked my crate as a safe place, but now I like to snuggle with my foster Mom. I sleep soundly in my crate all night. Loud noises and unexpected cat appearances startle me, but I do not chase them. \n\nADOPTION FEE: $350\n\n***WE DO NOT DO OUT OF STATE ADOPTIONS***\n\nIf you would like to learn more information about me, or to even adopt me please contact Peace for Paws Ohio at: adopt@peaceforpawsohio.org.\n\nBecause we will not do on-the-spot adoptions, we ask that you fill out an adoption application prior to inquiring about meeting any of our pets. Please give us at least 48 hours excluding weekends and holidays to get in touch with you once your application has been submitted.\n\nFill out an adoption application: http://peaceforpawsohio.org/adopt/adoption-application/\n \nHave a question about a foster dog?

He is all terrier when it comes to kids and would do best in a home with older kids or no kids. They weren't sure how he was with other dogs or cats, he seems to be intimidated by other dogs when passing his cage. He does take some time to warm up to people and will growl and even snap at strangers if he feels scared, sometimes unpredictable. He is very food motivated and would do best in a house hold with someone who has time to work him through his guarding issues. He loves going on long walks and playing with squeaky toys or playing fetch. We feel like he would prefer to be the only pet, in a child free home where he can receive all the attention and one on one time, with a quiet house hold. He does know how to sit and walks well on a leash.",

Callie is a 30lb, approximately 2 year old slightly shy at first sweetheart.  She had suffered a gunshot wound to her shoulder at some point, the shrapnel shows up on xray, but she still uses that leg with ease and is really fast on it to boot!  Callie is good with other dogs and doesn't mind cats at all.  She is still relearning how to go to the bathroom outside but will use pee pads indoors.  I don't think she is a fan of the cold and loves to cuddle! Callie would make a great candidate for city living and/or apartment dwellers.\n\nCallie is up to date on vaccines, spayed, microchipped, dewormed, and treated with flea/tick/hw preventative.  Her adoption fee is $375.00.\n\nIF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING, PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n- The first step towards adoption is to complete an adoption application, which can be found online at our website www.roadtriprescues.com, under the \u201cADOPT\u201d tab.\n\n- Do not use the Petfinder links or email to ask us about our adoptable dog listings - we do not always receive these messages and will not respond to them.\n\n- Please do not ask if a dog is still available - we do our best to update their status as quickly as possible.  If a dog is listed for adoption, it means we have not yet approved an adopter and are still accepting applications.\n\n- PLEASE NOTE THAT ONLY APPROVED ADOPTERS WILL BE PERMITTED TO MEET OUR RESCUES - WE ARE A FOSTER BASED RESCUE AND ALL OF OUR DOGS LIVE WITH US AS FAMILY. \n\nThanks for considering a rescue pup!",

            "description": "Angel is a 2yr old Chihuahua mix looking for her new forever home! Angel came to us after coming from horrible living conditions and not being cared for properly. She is 19.5lbs and is full grown. When she first came to us, she was very hesitant and wasn't sure if she liked us. After 2 days of giving her space and time, she opened up and became the most sweetest and silliest girl. Once she was comfortable, we learned that she loves to be with her people, loves to play with other dogs, loves to do zoomies, and loves to play with toys! She also loves treats, going outside to run and play, and napping with a canine companion. We recommend an adult home only, and how she is with men is unknown. It would be best for everyone living in the home to come meet her. Since she has been with us, she seems to be housebroken and kennel trained. In a new environment she may need a few patience and reminders though. Angel would do best in a home with a yard. She is doing okay with leash training but ideally would do best with a yard. She may also do best with a confident, friendly, playful canine companion that loves to play and loves to nap with their canine buddy. Angel is the sweetest, most forgiving, silly and playful girl that just didn't have the best start in her short life. She will take patience adjusting in her new home with her new people, but it is worth the wait we promise! Angel is spayed, up to date on vaccinations, vet checked, and microchipped. Her adoption fee is $280 and comes with a complimentary vet visit. To meet her, please bring the whole household 2 legged and 4 to ensure it is a good fit.\nPlease come to our shelter location at 1102 W. Hatcher Rd. Phoenix, AZ 85021 anytime during business hours.

            "description": "We almost lost Ellie a bit ago-LOL-she blended right in to the dappled snow on the grass!!  At the time she may have wanted to be a little more incognito, she was settling in and really wanted to be left alone for a time. Ellia is 7 years old we are told, so that gives her a pretty good lifetime with a family. She seems to have been very much loved, and very well fed!! Sweet girl enjoys a fine meal, I can relate. That makes coming into the foster/rescue system a little more difficult. We could see her \"people searching\", a term used to describe a dog in rescue that is waiting for their family to return. She misses her family, sweet girl. \n\nThe good news is that Ellie has the tools to acclimate. She knows what love is and is very accepting of new people, she is such a little doll. She has lived with other dogs and even cats and is a little lady of a dog. Ellie is soft and snuggly, not pushy at all, she is the type girl that will step away if another dog wants to hog the attention, just makes you want to reach out to that sweet little face even more!!!  However, Ellie does have \"white coat syndrome\", she does NOT like going to the veterinarian and will need to be muzzled. Some dogs will take a little doggy downer before that trip to help out with the nerves, not uncommon, and not a huge issue. \n\nEllie will do well with a loving family, someone that will help her stay active and perhaps lose a couple pounds. She has had some chronic ear issues, perhaps a grain free/chicken free diet will help. We are doing that now and she seems to be doing well, we have noticed less redness around her eyes and ears. Sweet Ellie is 43 pounds, does fantastic with the other dogs, is a sweetheart of a girl and is looking for a family to love. Please--no long hours alone. Cattle dogs need activity and a job, she is not a couch potato type dog. \n\nEllie's adoption fee is $300, which is tax deductible. She is fully vetted, spayed and chipped. She will come with plenty of supplies to help her settle into her new home as well as a free month of insurance if you would like. Please email Kristine at joysparrows@gmail.com.",

I have been fostered with kids, and do well. I do not have experience with cats, so would need a cat free home. Some people say I resemble a Pit Bull, which is why this awesome rescue requires you to own your home in order to adopt me. Come and meet me! \n \n**If interested in adopting, please submit the adoption application on our website pp2crescue.com. We will be accepting applications, and will mark as pending adoption when no longer available.  Please do not submit an inquiry unless you have a specific question about the dog. We do not have the time or manpower to answer multiply emails asking if the dog is still available, your best chance at adopting is submitting the application. **\n\n**These are rescues, we do not know what their breed(s) are, nor can we guess. Best estimate full grown is a medium to large size dog. Will do require you to own your home to adopt a dog from this litter (this will be checked before application is approved).",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\nRoux (TX) is a male Australian Shepherd/Great Pyrenees mix rescued in Texas. Our veterinary partner estimates that Roux is 4 weeks old at the time of intake in January 2021. Roux is good with people of all ages and other dogs. Roux's life started out tragically, and it could have continued that way until it ended most likely before Roux was just a month old. Roux was found clinging to his Momma's dead body on the side of a road where she ended up when she was hit by a car. Rather than stop to help this Momma, the person who hit her just kept driving right past Momma and her babies. Roux was picked up by Animal Control and, since he required bottle feeding, his life would likely have ended upon arrival at the shelter. But this very kind Animal Control Officer diverted Roux to rescue and saved his life twice. Roux is now a Rescue Dogs Rock NYC pup, and his life is no longer tragic. In fact, his life is charmed! Roux is a happy go lucky, playful puppy. If you are looking for a four legged, active buddy, please apply online to adopt Roux (TX) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

She loves nothing more than hopping onto the couch or bed with you and resting her head on your lap. She's house trained, incredibly friendly to strangers, and is perfectly behaved when nobody's in the house. On her walks, she always excited to say hi to other people and dogs. She's friendly with all other dogs and people of all ages. She also loves to give kisses, play with her toys, and snuggle up with you when you're relaxing.

A 1.5 year old Husky mix, Griff is looking for a home that can handle his playful side. Griff is known for mouthy play with humans. He is good with other dogs, although he sometimes forgets how big he is. Griff is also great with cats. He is still young & needs to learn some basic obedience. Griff is a high energy dog & will need a family that is ready to keep him exercised. Griff would thrive best in an environment with a fur sibling who enjoys playing and a big yard. If children are in the home, they must be at least 15 years old. We prefer his new family have Husky experience, but is not required. Griff will also require a fenced in yard. \nAre you the perfect family for Griff and his dreamy blue eyes?\n\nThe Pet Connection is assisting with Griff's training and aiding in the search for Griff's perfect family.\nHe will come with age appropriate vaccinations, deworming, neuter, and microchip. His adoption fee is $200.\n\nTo adopt me, please fill out an adoption application on the Lucky 13 Rescue website www.lucky13rescue.org or use the following link\nhttps://forms.gle/Tc2jvVQ1oYjPSwmeA",

He has been great with crate and potty training and would do best with someone who is willing to continue that training with him.

            "description": "QUEEN, shelter number D21-01002, is a female terrier mix. She is about three years old and weighs about 35 pounds. She was surrendered to the shelter by her owner along with SAGE; we are not sure why. She is quite friendly and has no obvious health or behavioral problems. She walks well on leash and enjoys being petted. She should be good with kids and with most other dogs. With any of our dogs, it\u2019s a good idea for potential adopters with other dogs at home to bring them out to meet the potential adoptee dog before making a final decision.\nQUEEN would make a great indoor/outdoor dog. She has short hair and will not tolerate cold weather very well. She should at least be allowed to sleep indoors and be brought in during cold, wet or stormy weather during the day if possible. She should have plenty of water and good shade if left outside in the summer. She would make a great companion for watching TV or just hanging out in the evenings and would love to be included in any family activities indoors or out whenever possible.\nQUEEN is looking for another chance at a forever home.\nLevelland Animal Control is understaffed right now and adoptions are by appointment only. If you would like to meet QUEEN for a possible adoption, please call (806) 891-0829 from 9 to 5; if (806) 891-0829 doesn\u2019t answer, call (806) 894-6164 and tell them you are interested in adopting a dog. You may need to refer to QUEEN by her shelter number, D21-01002, when talking to an Animal Control employee.\nLevelland Animal Control is understaffed right now and adoptions are by appointment only.\nAll our dogs are vaccinated for Parvo, distemper, Bordetella (kennel cough) and most other common dog diseases. We do not vaccinate them for Rabies. There is no adoption fee, but the adopter will be responsible for having the dog spayed or neutered and for the Rabies shot.\nCheck the Google map for directions to the shelter located at 109 Commerce in Levelland, Texas.",

I was limping a bit but was lucky that nothing was broken. I am good as can be now. And boy am I good AND strong! I weigh around 80 pounds. And I'm 1-3 years old. I am not a fan of the other male dogs here. Not sure if I could get along with a female or not. I have not met the cats yet so not sure about that. I am strong and lacking leash walking manners. I am working on it here. I do enjoy walks, but tend to drag the person walking me, unless they can be firm in my training. I do listen and am eager to learn. I do sit like a proper boy. I sure love people! I will lean on you until I fall over! Then I'll go belly up for tummy rubs! I'm a big goofy guy! I'll be your faithful companion and your lap dog if you'll allow it. Send your application soon! \n\nPerry County Animal Rescue (PCoAR) 717-589-3005 Millerstown, PA www.perrycountyanimalrescue.org\n\nLinford met Ned, the rescue dog tester and he MIGHT be OK with cats but it would need to be HIGHLY monitored! He was very nosy but not snappy. Ned took a few swipes at him and he did not lunge or bark. \n\n\n\n",

            "description": "IMPORTANT!!!   All adoptions are by appointment only going forward and are spaced 30 minutes apart. PLEASE call the shelter directly during business hours for more information (see number below).  You need to make sure that the animal in which you have an interest is still available and to set up an appointment to meet the specific animal.  Once you arrive at the shelter for your scheduled appointment, please follow the directions that you were given over the telephone. If you are running late for your appointment or will be unable to make your scheduled appointment time, notify staff immediately. This will enable them to schedule that time for another prospective adoptive family. If necessary, they will be able to reschedule your appointment to a more convenient time.  \n\nMERLE HAGGARD - Hey, y\u2019all, here is another sweetheart in spite of the rough looking face he presents and his initial photos taken inside the building. He is actually a friendly, nice looking boy and his tail wags the whole time he is being photographed. His coloring is blue merle with white markings and he is a large boy with an intake weight of 82 pounds. Yikes! That is a whole lot of dog food each week. He is only about two years old, so that will be a whole lot of years of feeding this great big boy for some lucky person or family. MERLE has not been neutered and that still needs to be done before you can take him home. Please read the important information below and then call to schedule your adoption appointment.\n\nAdoption fees are $80 for dogs.  Cat adoption fees are $50. Cash or check only. Please be sure to take the exact amount with you.\n\nNOTE: All shelter fees are under review and may be changed or modified at any time without advance notice.\n\nThe shelter routinely vaccinates all healthy appearing animals upon their arrival at the shelter and deworms them.  Any animals not already spayed/neutered must have the procedure done through the veterinary clinic that contracts with the county before that animal can be released from the clinic to the new family. By state law, animals old enough to be given a rabies vaccine, must have that vaccine done, as well.  The vaccine is given by the veterinary clinic staff at a separate cost to the adoptive family. \n\nHold periods for every incoming animal vary for several reasons including, but not limited to, whether the animal came in from the Cumberland County area, or from the City of Crossville, which contracts with the county for its animal shelter services.  Check with the staff to verify the availability date of every animal for which you have an interest.\n\nFor more information on this pet, call the shelter at (931)484-8525. The shelter is open Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday from 10am to 2pm. Closed Wednesday and Sunday and county observed holidays.",

Our veterinary partner estimates that Landry is 4 weeks old at the time of intake in January 2021. Landry is good with people of all ages and other dogs. Landry's very short life thus far has been one of sadness and cruelty. Landry's Momma was hit by a car and left to die on the side of the road as the person who hit her just kept driving. To compound that sadness, Landry and his siblings, just 3 weeks old, were found clinging to their Momma's body. Landry and his siblings were picked up by Animal Control, and as they were too young to survive on their own, they typically would have been immediately euthanized. But fortune was shining down on Landry that day, as that particular Animal Control Officer diverted Landry into rescue, and now he will go on to live a happy life in a loving forever home. If you would like this cutie to become a member of your family, please apply online to adopt Landry (TX) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

Emails through Petfinder will more than likely not be answered due to volume of email we receive. Thank you for understanding. \n\nFor more information on our adoption process please visit our website at www.motleymuttsrescue.com. You can also check us our on our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/motleymuttsrescue where we post new dogs available for adoption several times a month. You can also follow us on Instagram at MotleyMuttsRescue. For specific information on a dog, please email motleyrescue@gmail.com\n\nAll Motley Mutts Rescue's puppies are spayed or neutered, up to date on vaccines, microchipped, up to date on flea, tick, and heartworm prevention. All adult dogs are also tested for heartworm prior to transport that are older than 6 months.  All puppies  and adult dogs will have seen a NH vet for a health certificate within 14 days of adoption. Unless otherwise noted adoption fees range from $450 on  adults and $550 on puppies and adults. Adoption fees reflect the costs we incur on vetting and transporting the dogs. All Motley Mutts are in NH for you to meet to see if there's a connection prior to adoption.",

I was saved from the scary shelter by I.C.A.R.E. Dog Rescue and now I live in a wonderful, loving foster home. I am super sweet, love my belly rubs, and I absolutely love to give lots of kisses. I get along great with dogs and kids but cats are unknown. I love to go for walks but since I'm so aventurous I have been known to take off to explore. I am potty trained, and I know the command \"sit\". I am very treat motivated and my foster family says I love to learn new things. He would do best with an active family with a small playful dog and a yard to run around and play in. If you want a sweet and loving furry friend, look no further... I'm your dog!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit the I.C.A.R.E. Dog Rescue website and complete an adoption application: www.icaredogrescue.org/ready-to-adopt\n\nAdoption fee includes: spay/neuter shots up to date micro-chip fecal and vet check",

            "description": "Meet Buddy, a 14-yr old senior Staffordshire Terrier boy who found himself at the shelter as an owner surrender. All this sweetie asks for is a soft bed in a household where he can live out his life. He does well with other dogs, big and small as long as they are calm like he is. Buddy is considered blind, and sees with his heart, but his Foster says he gets around just great and will follow her into the yard to do his potty. A house with no stairs to the yard is required. He can navigate small steps just fine. Buddy is gentle, housebroken and could stand to lose a few pounds. He\u2019s waiting to meet you ??  Buddy is currently in a foster home.  \n\nNotes from Buddy's foster...\n1) Sleeps through the night in X-pen with camera where I can check on him. I play soft music for him when in X-pen. \n\n2) Wakes around daylight - take him out immediately. Will pee, sometimes poop. (He has had zero accidents in the house to date so 100% housetrained.)\n\n3) Back inside for breakfast- 1 level cup kibble with some wet I/d food on top \n\n4) Outside again to finish his pee pee as he only goes a little bit on his first out. Second time out he urinates a lot!\n\n5) Back inside for vitamins, joint supplements and back to resting in his soft orthopedic bed.\n\n6) Several pee pee breaks during day - no special times he\u2019ll get anxious if it\u2019s time to go out.\n\n7) Dinner around 4:30pm is 3/4 cup kibble with I/d wet on top. Out to potty.\n\n8) Bedtime is 8pm here. One last potty break, lights out, soft music on all night in his room. Yes, he CAN hear.\n\nBuddy sleeps all night once he settles (11 hours usually)\n\nHe is able to walk through my house easily but I keep him on slip lead because I have slick wood laminate floors. His adopter may want to use some carpet runners in areas where he has to get up and down as it makes it easier on him. \n\nHe steps down two small 6-8\u201d steps to get into my secure courtyard to exercise & potty. I make sure he walks around for daily exercise as he needs to lose weight (he follows me off leash).\n\nHe has zero reaction to my two 18-lb female ShihTzu or my 6-lb female Pomeranian and they have no reaction to him, but I\u2019m still cautious and keep him on slip lead when passing them.\n\n\nHow to adopt: You must be an approved adopter to VIEW our animals.

He loves to play fetch, is great with other dogs, and is crate trained. He's just a easy going gentleman. If you have space in your heart for an old dog please consider adopting Duke. Duke is in NH and available to meet. \n\nPLEASE do not email us through the Petfinder inquiry but our direct email address. Emails through Petfinder will more than likely not be answered due to volume of email we receive. Thank you for understanding. \n\nFor more information on our adoption process please visit our website at www.motleymuttsrescue.com. You can also check us our on our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/motleymuttsrescue where we post new dogs available for adoption several times a month.

Unless otherwise noted adoption fees range from $450 on  adults and $550 on puppies and adults. Adoption fees reflect the costs we incur on vetting and transporting the dogs.

Once the application is approved, a member of Legacy will contact you to set up a home visit. The home visit usually last 1-1 1/2 hours and is to make sure our dog and any current dogs/cats are getting along, as well as both of us agreeing it's a fit. At this time the adoption fee is due, and begins the 2 week trial. We will check in during the 2 week trial. If it's not working, our dog is returned to the foster home and all except $100.00 {$75 if Senior} of the adoption fee is returned. At the end of the 2 week trial, you decide if you will finalize the adoption - if finalized, the Adoption Contract is signed and all medical records are turned over to you. If at any time you need to rehome the dog it contractually needs to be returned to Legacy Dog Rescue.\n\nADOPTION FEE's:\nPuppies under 6 months:  $199.00\nAdults:  $150.00\nSeniors (over 7 yrs):  $99.00\n\nIf you are interested in one of our dogs please fill out an application: \nhttps://form.jotform.com/193425528783165",

            "description": "Mickey (the boy) is 12 years old and weighs 12 pounds. Minnie (the girl) is 12 years old and weighs 6 pounds.\n\nHello out there,\nWe are Mickey and Minnie \u2013 the adorable doxypoos! OK, We may be named after those famous mice, but at least we don't have those ridiculously large, round ears and we are definitely larger \u2013 weighing in at a whopping 12 and 6 pounds respectively. Please, please don't ask us to sing the Mickey Mouse theme song though, because we do not know it. And our hair is definitely curlier than that giant mouse, but you wouldn't know it to see our latest haircut. If you adore curly, then just let it grow.\n\nWe've grown up together and always watch each other's backs. Minnie makes sure I get around ok and I do the same for her. I make sure she stays out of harm's way. We are very sad right now because the human we grew up with has recently passed away. We are overcome with grief, but would be even sadder if we were separated, so we fervently hope we are taken together \u2013 we love each other so much.\n\nWe are very friendly with children, though slightly nervous at first because we are so small and can be easily stepped on. After a bit though it is full speed ahead!\n\nWe can get a bit scared around strangers, but everyone turns into a friend soon. Play is our middle name and Snuggling is our second! If you give us a chance, you will soon have two best friends at the same time. What more could you want? Did we tell you that we like to snuggle? Yup, we love to snuggle.\n \nInterested in MICKEY AND MINNIE? The first step is to fill out our online Adoption Application (address link below)\n\nNote: All of our dogs live in foster homes so it is not possible to setup a meet and greet prior to submitting an adoption application. Filling out an application doesn't obligate you to adopt, but it does save your place in line if there are multiple people interested.\n \nADOPTION APPLICATION (Type or cut & paste the below website address into your browser): http://www.sdroregon.com/adoption-application.htm\n \nIf our Adoption Coordinator determines you are a good match they will contact you. This is a great opportunity for you to find out more about MICKEY AND MINNIE and decide if you would like to setup a meet and greet.  \n \nADOPTION FEE is $220 for the bonded pair.\n\n ADOPTION FEE is $150, and there\u2019s a 10% Discount for Senior Citizens and Veterans.\n \nWe apologize, but we are not able to answer individual questions about our dogs. We are a small, all-volunteer organization and we receive hundreds of inquiries. If you want to learn more about a particular dog, then please submit an Adoption Application. If your application is chosen, you will have the opportunity to meet the dog and to get answers to all of your questions. Thank you for your understanding.",

            "description": "A Lab-Chi??  Well, of course we do not know, we have not had a DNA. We couldn't figure out what this little girl might be. She acts like a lab, all full of love and fun, sniffs and smarts. But then on the other hand she can have a little bit of an attitude towards other much larger dogs, is only 30 pounds and has a lovely petite frame. How perfect is that for the person that would love a lab in their life but would prefer a more portable dog-lol!  \n\nEmmie is just 2 years old. She originally came from Alabama and was adopted from a Chicago shelter when she was a wee one, just 7 pounds. Well here we are a couple years later, who knows what changed but this little girl got the short end of the stick. So many families are facing hardships due to the Covid, so not judgment there, but so sad for the dogs, cats and such that do not understand why they lost their family. She is doing very well tho since arriving in her foster home. She is a healthy, active girl, but was just a little too stressed at the shelter. She is thin and needs to gain some weight, but otherwise there are no health concerns. \n\nEmmie will do well in an active home, no small children, please. She will do well with anther active, social dog, one perhaps she can learn from and gain some confidence. Emmie is very loving with her people, she is just a little unsure of some dogs, especially much larger dogs. She is a little love of a dog that needs her happily ever after with a loving family/person. So many rescue dogs need extra TLC, so please, a home that has to be gone for long hours is not the right home for Emmie. She is an awesome, loving little girl, loves her toys, her pals, and big hugs. She will do best in a dog savvy home that will know how to make her feel safe and comfy in her new home. \n\nEmmie is fully vetted and microchipped.  Her adoption fee is $350, which is tax deductible. She comes with a free month of insurance if you would like and plenty of supplies to help her settle into her new home.

Swooped up from the streets, skin and bones with no muscle tone at all, having been pegged by a car, a Good Samaritan picked him up and whisked him to a vet right away. After committing to his rescue, he was given a clean bill of health (minus the malnourishment, no muscle tone and a sore hip) he came up to us in CA. Herc is a GREAT dog, loving to all, and as in his name, this boy LOVES to play ball and retrieve it!! We are letting him enjoy this game (and lots of long walks/hikes) to build up his muscle tone, which is coming along so well. \n\nThis boy will need some house training (although he picks up so fast) and his lead training has been going extremely well.  He is an easy trained dog who listens well and loves on all.  \n\nHerc is approx 10 months old. He is neutered, vaccinated, wormed, and microchipped.  He would make a fabulous family dog to go out on family road trips, camping and more!",

            "description": "Hello my name is Bentley. I am a 1 year old Border Collie mix that weighs 55lbs. I am shy guy that does warm up quickly. I have been around other dogs and children but I have never been around cats so that would be a new experience for me. I am crate trained and house broken. I do walk best on a harness as I tend to pull a bit. I just need a little more work. A meet and greet is suggested if you have other dogs in the home. I need some time to bond with men so definitely bring them to the meet and greet so I can meet them. If all goes well, please understand that I will need some time acclimating to a new home and family members especially the man of the house. I can be a very good boy but change is hard for me and new things, people and places can be scary so if I seem a little anxious at times that's why. RAC staff is confident that once I am established in the home my anxiety will sub side. If you are interested in making me a part of your family, please submit an adoption application here: https://rockwalladoptions.com/adoptfoster/adoption-application/. RAC staff will be in touch with approved applicants to schedule a meet and greet. My adoption fee is $125. I am neutered, microchipped, and up to date on my yearly vaccines. I am heartworm negative.All animals unless otherwise noted in their descriptions are at 1825 Airport Road, Rockwall, TX.

He patiently sits and waits for his leash before or after a walk and happily greets other people or dogs while out. He knows simple commands like sit and down. Smiley loves being outside and would do great in a home with a backyard where he can watch squirrels, play fetch and run. Smiley does well with all people. Sometimes he forgets his size, so this playful pup may do best in a home with older children. Smiley does well with dogs, but a slow introduction is needed. Smiley came to us with an old injury that gives him a cute prance. He should be kept on a joint supplement to help prevent early onset arthritis. Smiley's adoption fee is FREE in memory of Bentley!",

I just need a roof over my head, a place to rest my paws, some food, and a little love would be nice. I am starting to know what toys are and finding them fun to play with.\n\nWhiskey is around 60lbs and about 5 years old. He is neutered, microchipped, updated on vaccines, and HW negative. He walks pretty good on a leash and we are in the process of teaching him to sit and stay. He is pretty shy and warms up better to woman than men. He is good with bigger dogs. Not a good fit for small dogs or cats.",

IF it says Pending, we chose someone, but they haven't met up yet.  If it says Adopted, then the dog has been happily united with a forever family.  IF nothing is there other than their name, they are still available.\n\nAPPLY if interested so you can be considered.\n\n*Our page is updated daily. Please go to www.wowdogrescue.org for any updates.\n\nHere is a sweet boy...LOVES all people, but was found being beat up by another dog. A lady stopped and helped break up the fight, and Jackson ended up with a gash on his head. It has been Vet checked, and he is on his way to recovery.  (Because of this incident, he may be a little nervous around bigger dogs...otherwise he seems fine.\n\nHe also was checked for his eyes that were running a lot and were itchy to him.. the vet feels he has allergies.  He is most likely a Poodle / Bichon mix.  Right around 4 yrs of age, and weighing in at 15 lbs.  He goes potty out side at the fosters home and loves to get any attention she will give him.\n\nHe sits by the door when he needs to go outside and Jackson has free run of the fosters home with no accidents.  Jackson is a fast walker, and he has been walking 2 miles every morning and 2 miles most evenings, (weather permitting), with a short afternoon walk sometimes thrown in the mix.\n\nNot sure about his reaction of cats, but we do not feel that he would bother one.\nHe does fine with car rides.\n\nJackson likes to cuddle and he sleeps in bed with the foster.  He likes bully sticks for snacking on.\n\nJackson is the type of dog that will require regular grooming.  IF this is something you are un-able to maintain, please do not apply.\n\nHe has his rabies shot, Bordetella and DHPP done.  He is scheduled to be neutered, and get his microchip done 1/27/21.  Once he is healed he can be adopted.\n\nJackson's adoption fee is set at $275.00\n\nWE ARE NOT PETFINDER.  WE ARE NOT ADOPTAPET OR RESCUE ME.  Our application is on our website:  www.wowdogrescue.org \n\n**PLEASE do not call to see if he is \"still\" available.  His Gallery photo on our website will be updated daily and will state his status.  IF we have chosen someone, he will be marked \"Pending\".  IF he has been adopted, he will be marked \"Adopted\".\n\n***Tired of not finding, or not being chosen for the dog of your dream?? \n Consider Fostering with us...Our Fosters have 1st chance at adopting the dog they foster, while we pay for everything.  Its a win win for both! YOU get to see if this is a good match for your family, while the dog is being loved in your home...",

            "description": "Omega is an adorable/wrinkly 10 week old American Bulldog/Boxer mix! \n\nIf you are interested in adopting the first step is to fill out an adoption application on our website aaanimalrescue.org. We are currently very busy! Please reach out to allaboardanimalrescue@gmail.com if you have an approved application on file! Please fill out an adoption application on our website if you are ready to adopt! \n\nThank you for your patience and understanding during this difficult time! We are on a mission to find everyone companions, we will continue to rescue dogs weekly! We update our page every Monday evening. We are not currently hosting any Petco adoption events for the public. We will be hosting meet/greet adoption appointments!\n\n\nBreed and size disclosure: As a rescue all of our dogs come to us from high-kill shelters or other rescues, so we do not get a lot of background or information on these dogs. We occasionally receive the mother with the puppies, but in most cases both parents are unknown. Because of this we do not know the full breeding of the dogs. We are required to list the dogs based on the breeds provided to us on their records, but they are all mixed breeds as far as we know, and we cannot guarantee the actual breeds of any of these dogs. Since the full breeding of the dogs is unknown we can also only give you an educated guess on the full-grown size of the dogs. All of the current information we have on the dogs is listed in their bio above. More information may be available at our adoption event, since a lot of the fosters turn in report cards on how the dog has done in their care when they drop them off. \n\nAdoption Process: If you are interested in adopting from us, the first step of our adoption process is to fill out an application online at http://aaanimalrescue.org/adoption_app.html. It takes us 24-48 hours to process your application and get back to you, via email. Applications turned in Friday afternoon or Saturday morning will not be processed since we are preparing for or at our adoption event. We do have applications on site at our events, but are not always able to approve them at that time and many of the dogs will already have holds on them, so we suggest you fill out an application prior to attending an adoption event. We can place a hold on one dog per approved applicant after a deposit fee has been received, please do not ask to hold a dog if you have not turned in an application and been approved, for the first hour of our adoption event, so that they can get the first chance to meet and hopefully adopt that dog. After the first hour of the event all dogs are available on a first come, first serve basis. If you already have an approved application on file, there will just be more paperwork and the adoption fee at the event, but you will be able to take home the dog/puppy that day. Since we are foster based and do not have a location, our dogs are only available to meet at our events, unless otherwise noted.",

We are currently very busy! Please reach out to allaboardanimalrescue@gmail.com if you have an approved application on file! Please fill out an adoption application on our website if you are ready to adopt! \n\nThank you for your patience and understanding during this difficult time! We are on a mission to find everyone companions, we will continue to rescue dogs weekly! We update our page every Monday evening. We are not currently hosting any Petco adoption events for the public. We will be hosting meet/greet adoption appointments!\n\n\nBreed and size disclosure: As a rescue all of our dogs come to us from high-kill shelters or other rescues, so we do not get a lot of background or information on these dogs. We occasionally receive the mother with the puppies, but in most cases both parents are unknown. Because of this we do not know the full breeding of the dogs. We are required to list the dogs based on the breeds provided to us on their records, but they are all mixed breeds as far as we know, and we cannot guarantee the actual breeds of any of these dogs. Since the full breeding of the dogs is unknown we can also only give you an educated guess on the full-grown size of the dogs. All of the current information we have on the dogs is listed in their bio above. More information may be available at our adoption event, since a lot of the fosters turn in report cards on how the dog has done in their care when they drop them off. \n\nAdoption Process: If you are interested in adopting from us, the first step of our adoption process is to fill out an application online at http://aaanimalrescue.org/adoption_app.html. It takes us 24-48 hours to process your application and get back to you, via email. Applications turned in Friday afternoon or Saturday morning will not be processed since we are preparing for or at our adoption event. We do have applications on site at our events, but are not always able to approve them at that time and many of the dogs will already have holds on them, so we suggest you fill out an application prior to attending an adoption event. We can place a hold on one dog per approved applicant after a deposit fee has been received, please do not ask to hold a dog if you have not turned in an application and been approved, for the first hour of our adoption event, so that they can get the first chance to meet and hopefully adopt that dog. After the first hour of the event all dogs are available on a first come, first serve basis. If you already have an approved application on file, there will just be more paperwork and the adoption fee at the event, but you will be able to take home the dog/puppy that day. Since we are foster based and do not have a location, our dogs are only available to meet at our events, unless otherwise noted.",

            "description": "Otis is an adorable/wrinkly 10 week old American Bulldog/Boxer mix! \n\nIf you are interested in adopting the first step is to fill out an adoption application on our website aaanimalrescue.org. We are currently very busy! Please reach out to allaboardanimalrescue@gmail.com if you have an approved application on file! Please fill out an adoption application on our website if you are ready to adopt! \n\nThank you for your patience and understanding during this difficult time! We are on a mission to find everyone companions, we will continue to rescue dogs weekly! We update our page every Monday evening. We are not currently hosting any Petco adoption events for the public. We will be hosting meet/greet adoption appointments!\n\n\nBreed and size disclosure: As a rescue all of our dogs come to us from high-kill shelters or other rescues, so we do not get a lot of background or information on these dogs. We occasionally receive the mother with the puppies, but in most cases both parents are unknown. Because of this we do not know the full breeding of the dogs. We are required to list the dogs based on the breeds provided to us on their records, but they are all mixed breeds as far as we know, and we cannot guarantee the actual breeds of any of these dogs. Since the full breeding of the dogs is unknown we can also only give you an educated guess on the full-grown size of the dogs. All of the current information we have on the dogs is listed in their bio above. More information may be available at our adoption event, since a lot of the fosters turn in report cards on how the dog has done in their care when they drop them off. \n\nAdoption Process: If you are interested in adopting from us, the first step of our adoption process is to fill out an application online at http://aaanimalrescue.org/adoption_app.html. It takes us 24-48 hours to process your application and get back to you, via email. Applications turned in Friday afternoon or Saturday morning will not be processed since we are preparing for or at our adoption event. We do have applications on site at our events, but are not always able to approve them at that time and many of the dogs will already have holds on them, so we suggest you fill out an application prior to attending an adoption event. We can place a hold on one dog per approved applicant after a deposit fee has been received, please do not ask to hold a dog if you have not turned in an application and been approved, for the first hour of our adoption event, so that they can get the first chance to meet and hopefully adopt that dog. After the first hour of the event all dogs are available on a first come, first serve basis. If you already have an approved application on file, there will just be more paperwork and the adoption fee at the event, but you will be able to take home the dog/puppy that day. Since we are foster based and do not have a location, our dogs are only available to meet at our events, unless otherwise noted.",

She does not need to be crated as she doesn\u2019t bother anything. She loves toys. Rainey also loves the car. She was returned due to not liking the husband in her adoptive home. She barked twice at my husband. We told her that was not ok and now they are best friends. She sleeps all night on the bed with us. She also loves our 10 year old daughter. Rainey has met many new people men, woman and children, and loves them all . She does not have a history with really young kids. Rainey is making progress going outside. We have a small fenced in porch and she has been asking to go out there to potty. It is covered in snow. I quickly reward her and she is getting more comfortable everyday. This girl is a complete gem and will be a wonderful companion with some patience.\n\n\nRainey's adoption fee is $425\n\nIf you do not hear from us within 7 days please email passion4petsrescue@gmail.com",

Inquiries requesting additional information will not be returned, due to limited volunteers. Thank you for your understanding **** \n\nMeet Annabelle.\n\nAnnabelle is being returned to our rescue, along with her brother Chucky, due to their family being relocated to Australia for work.\n\nShe is estimated to have been born in June 2019, making her just over 1.5 years old. She is house broken, walks well on a leash, has moved past the chewing stage for the most part, is up to date on her vaccinations, spayed, microchipped, and LOVES to snuggle. \n\nShe does great with people and other dogs but has not been cat tested.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAll PETronus Rescue dogs receive basic vaccinations (distemper/parvo, bordetella, & rabies), spay/ neuter, and microchip prior to adoption. We also treat any know medical issues, including heartworms.\n\nOur dogs live in foster homes while they wait patiently for their forever families to find them. This is beneficial in that they learn house manners, crate training, housebreaking, etc while they wait and we are also able to get a very realistic picture of their energy level, temperament, etc so that we can place them in a home that is the best fit.\n\nOur adoption fees are $200 for dogs over 1 year of age and $250 for dogs under 1 year of age. Puppies receive 3 rounds of puppy vaccinations.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our amazing dogs, please fill out our adoption application here http://bit.ly/PRAdoption and we will be in touch!\n\n",

            "description": "Meet Viola!\n\nViola was found chained to a building down in Mexicali and Yuya Duran, and her local rescuer reached out for help. On January 24th, Viola made it across the border and up to FFF. Soon after Viola arrived, she went to live in a foster home to get extra TLC, and she's certainly getting it! They bathed her, learned her favorite meals to encourage her to eat, and equipped her with booties so she wouldn't slip on their floors.\n\nWe took Viola to College Animal Hospital for diagnostics. They reported that Viola is underweight and could probably put on another 10 pounds or so. Her x-rays showed some spondylosis (a type of arthritis caused by wear and tear to the spine) too, which may be why she walks timidly. She is missing many teeth and has some chronically worn teeth. Viola will have a dental on the same day as her spay. There were a few elevated values on her bloowork, so we're going to do an abdominal scan, too.\n\nWe received a great first update from Viola's foster mom: \"Viola is just the sweetest gal there is! This little toothless beauty tolerates baths and grooming without a peep and gets along with other dogs and cats. No accidents in the home anymore, but I need to be super vigilant in taking her outside. Viola doesn't know how to ask. She's getting feisty and stronger by the day. A big fan of Wendy's frosties and assisted strolls on the beach/dog park!\"\n\nBe sure to watch the cute video of Viola playing with a toy!\n\nVisit us at Open House: Saturdays & Sundays, 10 am - 1 pm.\n\nLearn more about our programs at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family. No adoption fees and we help with medical costs!\n\nApply to become a family: www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\nUpdated: 1/31/21 KG",

            "description": "\nMax \nPittsburgh, PA\n\nMeet Max!  This little guy is THE sweetest ever! Max is a senior Min Pin (10-12 years old) who found himself in a bad situation. Thankfully someone stood up and removed Max from that situation and helped him make his way to DDR. At one point in Max's life, someone actually kicked Max into a wall. Thankfully Max survived, but unfortunately he did suffer some neurological damage from the incident. He can walk and get around, but he is wobbly and most certainly can never have access to stairs. He would most certainly fall down the stairs and hurt himself further. He also has a bit of a head tilt due to the neurological trauma.\nThis charismatic little guy is definitely special needs, but such a total love! He is super affectionate and wants nothing more than to be with his foster mom. He LOVES giving kisses, being held, and curling up on her lap. While he loves being his velcro self, Max also loves everyone he meets. He is great in the car and he also gets along with every dog he meets. Max would do fine in a home with other CALM dogs or as an only dog. Again, NO STAIRS for MAX and he cannot go on walks. A quiet home looking for a sweet companion to spend time with would be his ideal forever home. Dog savvy children over the age of 16 only. \n\nIf you are interested in this little guy please visit our website www.ddrinc.net to fill out an application. \nPittsburgh, PA\n\n",

This girl loves going on walks, playing with toys, watching wildlife from the window and cuddling with her human.  What she loves the most are belly rubs, hugs and kisses.  You can see her huge smile and her eyes would squint when she\u2019s happy. She has the kindest eyes and a heartwarming face that will light up your day.  She loves sleeping in bed and being tucked in right next to you for extra warmth.  She also enjoys her \"pawdicure\" -- she will sit and hand you her paw as if it's bonding time.  The vet loves her and always comments on what a sweet girl she is!  \n\n As sweet as Hannah is, she is extremely shy, especially with new people.  She\u2019s looking for someone who will be patient and give her time to know you and adjust to her new surroundings.  She would love a quiet home with another dog sibling to show her the ropes.  Also, a fenced-in backyard would be a plus but not absolutely necessary, so long as she gets her daily walks.  Hannah is 8 years old, weighs 55 lbs., is spayed and vaccinated.  To adopt this black beauty, please contact Pyul at pyul.strayfromtheheart@gmail.com or fill out our on-line adoption application at strayfromtheheart.org.",

There he sat through Christmas waiting for his family to find him, someone to adopt or a rescue to help.  He sat there through New Years and into January when he was brought to our attention. Ozzie is affectionately described as a sweet boy with the cutest little wiggle and happy dance. He can sit, shake and speak. And does this boy like to talk\u2026If he has something to say about anything he will tell you. He would be in heaven if he has a sofa where he can lay and stretch his legs.\nOzzie is only 45 lbs., he has the look and colors of a rottie, but his is mixed with another breed that will keep him on the small.  He does well with other dogs, but we do not know about cats. He is housebroken but might need time to readjust to a new home.  If there are children in his new home, they should be over the age of 7.\nIf you are interested in including OZZIE in your home, please go to our website Placement Page http://www.recycledrotts.org/wp/?page_id=150 for the rescue location, placement policies, placement fee and the link to our online application.",

It has taken us some time, but he is healthy and ready to start his new life! Whit is a 2-year-old Walker Hound who weighs 57lbs. He loves everyone and everything; dogs, cats, kids, and life itself! We have only heard Whit bark a handful of times over the last few months. He will need a fenced yard; he knows how to use a dog door and likes to come and go as he pleases. Whit travels well; he has been out running errands and loves hanging out at breweries. If you are looking for a loving dog to spoil, look no further!\n\nIf you are interested in adoption; DO NOT CALL, please complete an online application on 4 Paws Animal Rescue's website at www.4pawz.org. We verify the care of past/current pets as well as home information. Our goal is to have the very best home for all our dogs and cats, and therefore, we reserve the right to approve or deny an application based on what we determine is in the pet's best interest.",

I've got lots of energy and really enjoy running around outside. I like treats too and will never turn down something yummy to eat. So far I know how to 'sit' but sometimes I get too excited to listen. I'm looking for an active family who can make sure I get lots and lots of exercise. Maybe we can enjoy a nice hike together!

Well now that she\u2019s done with that big chore, she is ready to score her happily ever after!  Noel is timid when she meets new people and may give you a few barks and avoid you at first, but once she learns you\u2019re not a threat, she is all wiggles and kisses.

She previously lived in a home with kids. Casey is currently in a foster home with several other dogs. Her foster says, \u201cshe is doing well with their potty routine and LOVES people. Prepare to have your heart stolen.\u201d To adopt this heart-stealer, apply at ITVrescue.org.\n\nAll of our animals are examined by a veterinarian, given age-appropriate vaccinations, dewormed, microchipped, spayed or neutered, heartworm tested and treated if necessary.\n\nPlease realize that many of our animals are kept in foster homes. Please complete an adoption application at http://itvrescue.org/adoption-application/ in order to meet with one of our animals. There is no obligation in completing the application, but it helps us find an animal that is most appropriate for your family.  The ITV Rescue Center is open Tuesdays 12-5; Wednesdays 12-7; Thursdays 12-5; Fridays 12-5 and Saturdays 10-5.  The Rescue Center is located at 1417 N. Stockwell Road.  You are welcome to come to our rescue center during open hours to see all of our great adoptable animals. Thank you for your interest in our animals!\n\nNOTE: Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable, so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.",

He loves people, children, and other dogs, but does get nervous in new surroundings and can get overwhelmed on walks and at the dog park so he\u2019ll need a patient family to teach him that he\u2019s safe and free to explore. He\u2019s the perfect candidate for obedience training as he\u2019s a clean slate, and is currently learning to sit and wait for his food. He is still house and crate training with frequent potty breaks, and will benefit greatly with a nice backyard to run around in, perhaps with an older dog companion to show him the ropes.
