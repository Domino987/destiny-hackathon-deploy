She'd like a calm home to match her calm nature.  She's a bit shy around new people, choosing to be patient with making new friends and taking her time to settle into new environments.  All that won't matter once she's gotten to know you and gives you her trust - because Bella LOVES attention and affection from the people she loves.  She's a special girl who has many fans here at the shelter.  Would you like to come and meet Bella?  Email adoption@wilco.org to schedule an appointment.  She will return the kindness of your patience with a lifetime of love and devotion!",

            "description": "This is Derby Densmore. He is a purebred Boston terrier, about 22 lb, and is only 7- years old despite the grey over his eyes. This boy is happy, bouncy, and needs discipline to behave--if he has it, he's very obedient. If he doesn't have that discipline, he will take charge and will be a problem child. He needs an experienced Boston parent.\nDerby is energetic to say the least. Loving, very affectionate, hearty and healthy. Needs exercise and mental stimulation--walks are great, as long as discipline is maintained--walks are important mental exercise. He would love an active person who wants to take him on adventures, not set him on a pillow. He can be dog aggressive, but will listen if he believes in his boss.\n\nAdopter must come to North Carolina where Derby is and meet with the trainer that has been working with him. A training session is included in the adoption and the trainer has to feel confident that the adopter will follow through with techniques taught at the session.\n\nDerby Densmore is neutered, UTD on vaccines, microchipped and heart worm negative. For more info on Derby, call his buddy, Cindy, at 919-302-6126.\nThe adoption fee will be $275.00 The 1st step is always an application found at: www.bostonterriertn.org (the $20 app fee is required before consideration) If you want to meet me, please call my buddy Cindy at cinjohack@bellsouth.net We prefer homes with prior Boston experience and current pet history.\nNOTE: Submission of an application and fee does not guarantee adoption of any specific Boston, since that particular dog may have applications pending or may not be the right match for you.\n\nPlease use the foster momma or dad's contact information above for questions.\nThe process always begins with an application which can be found at The Boston Terrier Rescue of East Tennessee website\nNote that in most cases, we do not adopt to families with small children, e.g., 'under 6,' as a precaution to the child's safety and the dog's safety. In some cases with larger Boston mixes or other dogs, we do make exceptions. Please ask the foster momma.\nWe prefer to place dogs within driving distance of where they are being fostered. If someone from outside the local area is approved for adoption, they must be willing to personally drive/fly to get the dog. The East Coast division (NC/SC/VA/MD/DC) does have special transport capabilties for their kids. Ask them.\nAlso, submission of an application and fee does not guarantee adoption of any specific Boston since that particular dog may have applications pending or may not be the right match for you.",

He is such a sweet boy but is very confused because he doesn't see well.  He sees ok in lighted areas, but in the dark he has trouble.  Once he finds you, he melts into you and is so excited to love on you.  He is a great dog but definitely needs some work. \n\nBennett is neutered, up to date on vaccines and heartworm negative.  He is crate trained.  He gets along with other dogs his size that don't mind his energy. \n\nBennett comes with a full training scholarship to anyone that is local to Southeastern CT.  He is currently doing board and train at Fun Play Bark in Groton.  \n\nIf you are interested in meeting Bennett, please reach out to Elena via phone, text, or email. 860-857-2270/elena.rogan.cecil@gmail.com",

Frances can be dog selective and unsure about cats.  He loves attention from his people, is treat motivated and easy to train. We are working on manners with Frances and he is doing great. Frances LOVES his toys!! Children should be 10yrs old or older. Frances would love for his family to be home most of the time and would benefit from having a fenced yard and a family that will take him for walks so he can explore his surroundings. If you think Frances could be a good fit for your family, please complete the adoption application on our website www.hsuc.org. \n",

I'm a special case, I've ran wild for most of my life, until 8/12 when these mysterious ladies caught me, days from giving birth. I was massively pregnant with 8 puppies, uncomfortable with human contact/presence, and in survival mode. After a few short days of being in this safe haven, I gave birth to 8 beautiful pups. My babies would help me get more comfortable with these lovely ladies who wanted to show me nothing but love. Slowly but surely I am gaining more confidence to get comfortable with human interaction. After my puppies found their forever homes, we've began to do more one on one interactions to try to boost my confidence. I am easily frightened by loud noises and fast movement. I would exceed best in a home with no other pets and no children. I need a laid back home where I will have time to adjust and time to learn to trust. Time and patience is my key needs in succeeding in becoming the best dog I can be. If you or someone you know, has the time, patience, and heart of gold to take this babe in, please contact us at 2603472563 or via Facebook messenger.",

She is working on sharing her foster parents with the other dogs. She just gives a low growl, so this is a minor training issue she'll learn. 6-year-old Dana is 13 pounds, healthy, and ready for her devoted home. Dana walks well on the leash and would benefit from some good outings to keep her socialized and happy. Dana's adoption fee is $350 to go towards her vetting (vaccines, spay/neuter, heartworm/Ehrlichia/Lyme test, fecal test, pre-op blood work, dental cleaning, and microchip as well as grooming if needed). If you are interested please fill out the adoption application For additional information regarding our adoption process, please check our FAQ's Page. \n\n *All dogs in the care of Get a Life Pet Rescue live in loving foster homes while waiting for their perfect match. They don't live in cages or crates (unless there is a medical reason to do so.) They are treated as family pets while in our care. * All dogs in our care are fed premium brand holistic food as well as supplements and vitamins specific to each dog's needs. We don't buy inexpensive bulk dry kibble, our rescues are fed premium wet food diets as part of a comprehensive rehabilitation program to ensure maximum health.*All of our rescues receive complete quality vetting including full dental cleaning with pre-op bloodwork, spay/neuter, vaccines, and grooming. Dogs in need of specialized medicine will be seen by specialists, such as full cardiac workups, ophthalmologist visits, all suspicious lumps, and bumps are biopsied, and every medical need is transparent to potential adopters. *Once you adopt from Get a Life Pet Rescue, you become part of our compassionate family and we are here for you if a problem with your precious dog arises.",

To arrange a meet and greet with a dog, you MUST fill out the adoption application so that it can be sent to the foster parent for review to determine if your home is a match for the dog. If a dog receives multiple applications, we operate on a best-fit basis, not first come first served.***\n\nHey there! I'm Eve. I'm a goofy and charming senior gal looking for a loving family to live out my golden years with. Let me tell you my story. I am just over 10 years old and I was rescued from the local county shelter. It was clear to the humans that saved me that I had lived a long life of having many litters of puppies. I was thin and dirty but I didn't let my past keep me down.\n\nNow that I'm happily living the couch life with my foster parents, they tell me I'm a big goofball with a lively spirit for my age. I absolutely love people and I am amazing with kids. The humans tell me I'm an 80 pound dog and that big dogs can't be lap dogs. I don't believe them. If you let me cuddle with you then I'm going to accept the invitation to do so. I am looking for a home where I can be the only pet since I love my humans so much I get jealous. I am really looking forward to being the center of someone's world.\n\nI also love my stuffed toys. When my foster parents leave, I sit by the window and wait for them. I do get anxious because I don't want them to stay away long, but I know what's mine to play with in the house when I'm feeling a little upset. When they come home, I've never been happier. I check to make sure they're okay then I go straight to my toys to show them how happy I am with a few squeaks. Exploring outdoors is fun for me, which is why I'd love a porch or yard. I like doing anything my humans do. As long as my family knows I need more patience and creativity (especially with finishing all my food) than those young gals. I like treats (especially when I'm a good listener on walks), but belly rubs, head scratches, being brushed and being told I'm good are my biggest motivators. \n\nI have this thing called heartworms. I am currently undergoing treatment. Don't worry though I can still be adopted and would love to be your gal.",

Shes also house trained and does well by herself. She can be reactive to other dogs on walks, but Im sure with the right training that could be fixed. \n\nHW+ simply means the dog has tested positive for heart worms in our screening process. We utilize what is called the fast-kill method which means we place the dog on antibiotics for 30 days and then administer 3 injections in increments afterward. The cost to treat heart worms is rather steep. However, thanks to our generous donors, we are able to cover that cost for our adopters so long as they go to our veterinarian, Red Rocks Animal Center in Lakewood.\n\nApproved Applicants may make the adoption fee payment by clicking donate above. Partial adoption fees will not hold a dog.\n\nIf upon meeting the dog of your choosing at an adoption event you find that you aren't a good match, your deposit will be refunded minus a 10% administration fee.\n\nIn-person adoptions will begin on the date of a dog's first event provided they are still available. Dogs not adopted during their first event will attend additional events thereafter until adopted. \n\nAn adoption application online is required prior to viewing our dogs. Adoption fees include vaccines up until time of adoption, microchip, spay/neuter and 1st 30 days of free Pet insurance. We are not affiliated with Pet First pet insurance. (you have to sign up for the insurance or it will not go into effect). Adopters can go to our vet for medical issues that may arise in 1st 3 days of adoption. \n\nThe dogs in our care are fostered in Colorado, Texas, and New Mexico. While all dogs are picked up during our scheduled times, sometimes transport dates change due to unforeseen circumstances.",

            "description": "Gunner is about 10 months old and is a love bug once he knows you. He loves car rides and walks at the park. Gunner needs a home with NO SMALL pets on property. He has been good with the other puppies here in his foster home but we are still working on socializing with dogs his size. He is crate trained but needs a very strong sturdy crate to stay safe in while away from the home. Gunner would enjoy someone that is home more or is able to take him where they go. He does great with the young kids in the house. I am also leash and house trained. \n\nThe adoption fee for this handsome boy is $225. He has been neutered, microchipped and is up to date on vaccines!\n\nWant to meet Gunner? Submit an adoption application and someone will be in touch to schedule a meet n greet to see if hes the right match for you!",

            "description": "We are not currently accepting additional applications for Xihua; check back for updates\n\nAnimal Profile: Xihua is a 3-year-old 40lb male mixed breed who was saved from the streets of Mexico at 4 weeks old and lovingly raised with a family here in Seattle. However, unfortunately with three small kids and small animals in the home, Xihua now needs a new family. Xihua is house trained, clean and adorable but he can be aloof and is reactive to dogs on walks. While he lives with another dog without issues, he is slow to make dog friends. He does not have stranger danger but is generally anxious. He is very food motivated and trainable, and would do wonderfully as the only pet in a quiet household.\n\nDGS Evaluation Notes: Xihua was very quick to warm up to humans (no reaction), was very responsive to correction with a slip lead giving eye contact and taking treats, and was able to walk around other balanced dogs without reaction at a distance of 10'. He could live in a home with a balanced dog and structured introductions. He will need continued leash training. He is okay with people. He has no bite history. He's adorable and a good size - 40 or so lbs.\n\nFoster Updates: Xihua is affectionate and playful. He has not been aloof as far as we have seen at all. He has a vigorous play style! He will react on leash to reactive dogs and will need continued training in this department. He's a really good boy in the house, a little excited about visitors and passerbys but responds well to correction. Naughty behaviors like countersurfing or begging are easily interrupted with a verbal no. No accidents or destructive behaviors. He would do amazing with a couple or family with older kids in a calm home that wants a companion animal. No cats or small kids. Balanced dogs considered.\n\nAdoption Info:\nAdoption fee is $400 which includes spay/neuter, all core vaccinations, microchip, heartworm test and health certificate. Your adoption fee may be tax deductible as Dog Gone Seattle is a federal 501c3 organization.\n\nApply online: www.doggoneseattle.org/adoption-application",

She loves to snuggle (and snore!) and when it is a bit colder she loves to snooze with you under a blanket. She is very playful and doing zoomies outside is one of her favorite pastimes. When you come back home she will wag her tail so hard that it almost hits her in her face. She continues to be a calm dog indoors and does perfectly when she is alone. We've done some time-lapses when we were out and she mainly snoozes on the sofa and stares at the squirrels in the garden. She is not a barky dog but will alert you by barking once when the doorbell is rung. She learns commands easily; in a matter of days, she learned to sit and stay when we put her food on the ground. We can even walk out of her sight without her running towards her bowl. She loves people but can be a bit nervous/protective when new people or dogs approach her. She usually does warm up to people quickly though. Due to a lack of socialization, she still needs to work on her dog reactiveness. At this time she should be the only dog in the home.",

            "description": "Miss Phoebe is one extremely friendly gal who happily accepts cuddles from absolutely everyone. She loves attention! Scratches and rubs are the key to her heart. The more adults, the merrier for Phoebe! As she does not like to be alone, her ideal home could include another dog to be her best friend, or a family so she can truly embrace all of the attention she craves and deserves from everyone. She does not do well around cats. In her spare time, she enjoys sleeping, being goofy and playing. Phoebe is so excited to find her furever home! \n\nPhoebe does need slow introductions to new dogs in a quiet atmosphere. She warms up to them, but if the atmosphere is too busy, she gets nervous and acts out. She does not like to be left alone and does take meds to help with her with her separation anxiety. She is on special food for kidney disease. She may be ten, but she's got a lot life left in her! She's good at doing stairs and does very well in the car! For her, a car ride is a great opportunity for a nap! She is super friendly dog who needs a furever home that has the patience for her to learn to trust and relax. She comes with her issues, but the cuddles, kisses and unconditional love she gives make it all worth while! \n\nAdoption Fee: $250\nLocation: Foster Home",

He was so happy to receive attention from people giving him yummy treats for just being himself. \n\nTazz sits on command and allows all over handling. For being so skinny he is particular about what he puts in his body, no basic treats for this guy. When he wanted more treats he did the cutest butt scoot closer but not being too invasive in our personal space. Tazz wags his tail like he means it too. \n\nTazz LOVES toys and is amazing at fetch.  He brings the ball back and drops on command.  He\u2019s happy to self-entertain with toys and when you want some attention from him, he\u2019s happy to let you rub his belly. \n",

Look at those eyes!! BEAUTIFUL!! She is so bewildered by the shelter environment. Not sure how she got here or why she is here. We have spent time with her over the past week since age arrived at the shelter and can see it will take a little more time for her to trust us. She is easy to leash up and take outside-she has learned the routine! When she sees the volunteer with treats and a leash approach her kennel she knows that mean it\u2019s her turn and she is ready!! Outside she keeps to herself coming close enough to ask for more treats but staring deeply into your eyes and making quiet snort sounds-that means \u201cI would like more treats please\u201d. \n\nNora spends most of her time sniffing the perimeter of the play yard and will often watch trucks as they park nearby-I imagine she is thinking to herself \u201care they here for me ?\u201d She misses someone and seems quite well cared for. Soon we know she will trust us at the shelter and see we only want the best for her. Give her a few days and she will blossom!! We love her don\u2019t you??\n",

PLEASE READ ENTIRE BIO BEFORE EMAILING****\n\n*Name: Winnie\n*Age: 3 years\n*Current Weight: 50 lbs\n*Rescued from: Houston, Texas\n*Adoption fee: $375 \n\nWinnie was rescued from the streets of Houston, Texas, where she was struggling to keep her litter of babies alive. All of her babies found amazing homes through SNARR and now it is Winnie's turn. Winnie is extremely loyal and affectionate to her people. She is a very soulful dog. She has many other doggie friends in her foster home, but requires proper introductions to other dogs. She follows her people from room to room and is very affectionate, but requries a slow introduction to feel comfortable around strangers. She would make someone who spends a lot of time at home a perfect company and best friend. \n\n*Health: up to date on required vaccines\n\nIMPORTANT: This dog has not yet been altered. For any dog or puppy that is not able to be spayed/neutered prior to adoption, SNARR requires a $125 deposit in addition to your adoption fee, as well as a strictly-enforced signed Spay/Neuter Contract stating you will have this dog altered within 6 months of adoption. The $125 deposit will be returned once the contract has been fulfilled. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $375 for adults. Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n\n\n",

He\u2019s potty trained, kennel trained, knows basic commands (sit, wait, heel and kennel) and walks well on a leash.\n\nKai can be possessive of his people and displays velcro dog tendencies - he\u2019s a loyal boy and loves deeply therefore a family that is experienced with resource guarding or is willing to go through obedience training is a must.  \n\nKai is a medium energy pup who loves to go for long walks, enjoys obedience training and playing with his foster dog siblings!  He has some prey drive so no small animals - cats, dogs, birds, etc.  Kai is respectful of dogs his size or bigger, especially the female dogs.  \n\nHe is neutered, up to date on vaccinations, and microchipped. The adoption fee is $550; please submit an application via our website.",

She leashes and walks well. She knows \"sit\" and would benefit from further training. She gets along well with most other dogs, but gets possessive over her toys. She's lively, goofy, and energetic. She loves to run, play, and roll in the grass. Duchess would do best to go to a home with a fenced in yard or to a large SAFE property where she can get the exercise she needs.\n...................................If you would like further information or would like to request an adoption application, please e-mail us directly at hss@cablelynx.com.

He had an old break in his leg which could not be fixed, so it had to be amputated. He also had really bad teeth and had to have 13 of them pulled! He is approximately 8-10 years of age. \n\nBuford is pretty chill for the most part. He likes to sleep in his dog bed for most of the day, but if he hears a treat bag or food being eaten, he is wide awake and your best friend! He is only 20 pounds, and you will need to make sure that he does not over eat and become overweight, otherwise it will be very taxing with just three legs. We are hoping to find him a home with no stairs, or only a couple of stairs that the human is willing to carry him up and down if needed. He can do stairs, but this could be one an issue as he ages in a few years. \n\nHe is currently fostered with a cat, but he does chase her. Your cat wound have to be the kind of cat that isn\u2019t going to take his bullying! \n\nYou will not be considered for Buford if you plan to use the tie out.",

Please read our Frequently Asked Questions and Adoption Processed Explained documentation.\n_________ B I O ______________\n\nName:Skittles\nSize: ~Medium range: 26-60 lbs\nAdoption Donation:$200 (applicable sales tax included).Adoption fees may be paid by cash or check.\nOther:Spayed Female, Vaccinations current, Microchip, No other pets, No children, and must have a fenced-in yard.\n\nSkittleswould luv to be your forever girl!\n\nFoster Home Feedback\n\n*\nSkittles needs a home with No other pets, No children, and must have a fenced-in yard\n\n1/3/21: Skittles has been really great, she loves to play but she can also be a very lazy dog that sleeps the day away. I do not kennel her when I am gone and she has not had any accidents or ruined anything! She has a stuffed carrot that she absolutely adores right now. She just gently nibbles on it and carries it around with her, it has a squeaker in it but she doesn't even play hard enough to make a peep. Skittles also absolutely loves playing fetch and she plays very nice when we do play, and is very good at dropping toys.\n\nSkittles has been doing great meeting new people. She has had a couple of adoption meets, she stayed the weekend at another foster's home, she has even been going to the shelter to help me train in new volunteers! Skittles loves car rides and she rides really well in the car. Thank you for considering this sweet girl.\n\n11/22/2020: Skittles has had a little more difficult path than most dogs have to take at her age. She contracted parvovirus at 5 weeks old so she did not get the socialization that most dogs get in the first year of their life. She can be nervous meeting new people. Skittles is getting more comfortable meeting and seeing people every day she spends with me though. I expect the improvements to continue. We are working hard on clicker training and keeping her attention, on walks or any time there is a curious noise outside.\n\nSkittles is really great in the house. She spends the day snoozing or chewing on a bone, while I am at work and generally remains calm while I am home. She doesn't destroy anything when she is left alone. Skittles has had no accidents in the month or so that I have been fostering her. She will go into her kennel willingly but she would prefer to not be in there. We are working on making the kennel a positive space that she can go to and feel safe.\n\nSkittles absolutely loves to go exploring and sniffing around on walks. She really loves to play fetch as well and she plays very nicely. She rides fantastically in the car. Skittles REALLY needs someone to continue her training to keep her comfortable.\nTo view additional dogs available for adoption, please see our website: www.4luvofdog.org",

            "description": "Trooper is a male, 23 lb., caramel and white Terrier mix puppy. Trooper's estimated date of birth is September, 2020. He was rescued after being abandoned on the outskirts of a small Oklahoma town. Poor Trooper was dehydrated, starving and sick because he was eating whatever he could find to survive. Fortunately he was able to be treated at a local vet and he is now doing great! Trooper is such a cuddle bug and gets along with dogs and kids. He only needs potty training to become the perfect companion! Trooper has a $180.00 adoption fee plus the cost of 6 months of heartworm prevention. PUPPIES UNDER THE AGE OF 6 MONTHS CANNOT BE ADOPTED OUTSIDE OF THE IMMEDIATE TULSA AREA. NO EXCEPTIONS.\n\nNote: ARF reserves the right to deny any application that is deemed unsuitable for the animal. Please be aware that our animal adoptions are NOT on a first come- first serve basis. Our sole purpose is to find the best possible home for the animals that fall under our care. We do not ship our animals. All adopters are expected to come to Tulsa if approved.\n\nFor details on how to adopt please visit http://www.arftulsa.org/adopt.",

They would love to call your living room \"home\" to lounge around and snuggle! They have been together since they were puppies and are looking for a new home together after the passing of their previous owner. They are very friendly and love new people, unfortunately they do not do well with other pets. On a leash they love to go on walks and sit outside, and are very content to hang around with you as you complete the daily chores. Sara is in good all-around health, though Roxy is beginning to feel a little arthritic. They hope they go to a\nhome with someone home much of the time, as they do need frequent potty breaks. The sisters may not have as much energy as they did when they were puppies, but would still love to run and greet you when you come home. Give these sisters a chance to fill your home with happiness during their silver years.\n\n\nAdult dog adoptions include - spay/neuter, vaccines, microchip, 4dx, fecal, and flea preventative.  \n\nPuppy adoptions include - spay/neuter, vaccines including boosters, microchip, fecal,  and flea preventative \n\nAdoptions are held every Saturday from 10am-3pm at our shelter (1049 Macarthur Road in Whitehall across the street from the old Lehigh Valley Dairy) \n\nFor more information please email us at dogs@lvpeaceablekingdom.info \n\nApplications can be downloaded at www.lvpeaceablekingdom.info\n\nAll adoptions must be completed in person - we are unable to ship or transport dogs.",

CANCELED\nFor an application, please email info@tailsfromtheheart.org\n\nWith everything going on currently with COVID-19, we have canceled our public meet and greets until further notice. If you are interested in meeting any of our pets, please email us or fill out our online application. We can then review and send to the foster family. We may cancel our home visits as well but if you could attach photos of your yard and one or two of your home that would be great. In lieu of the visit this would allow us to meet you and allow you to meet the pet and conduct a possible adoption either outside your home or at a public place where safe distancing can occur.\n",

            "description": "CJ ~2 years old. Good with dogs. Kids and cats TBD. Needs a companion animal.\n\nGSRA adopts to residents of VA, NC, and SC only\n\nHello world! My name is CJ. I am a sweet but very timid and shy girl that is looking for my forever home. I am a very pretty girl, and am about 1-2 years old. I have a slender build. I weigh about 60 pounds, and won't get much bigger.\n\nNot much is known about my past. I ended up in a small rural shelter. I was so scared that I would not even let anyone near me. The volunteers worked on gaining my trust, and I was able to get into the rescue. I am going to need a special home. I am extremely fearful of new people and new things. Once I learn to trust you, I am totally devoted, and act like a typical happy dog. i know, I know, it sounds like a tale of two extremes...and it basically is.\n\nI am very bonded to my foster mom. She saved me from the scary shelter, feeds me every day, and has earned my trust. I act like a very enthusiastic and silly dog when she is around. I will run around the yard wagging my tail and jumping around. I also try to jump on my foster mom for attention. Occasionally I get to sleep in the bed and I think this is a great treat. I need some manners and need to learn to curb my enthusiasm. I do need some work on leash walking. We have not done that yet because I have been going through heartworm treatment, and had to stay quiet and stress free.\n\nWhen I am not with my foster mom, I am a lot more reserved around other people. I get easily frightened by new and unfamiliar things/environments. I am terrified of the vets office.... I will need a patient owner who is willing to spend time with me to continue to expose me to new things and help desensitize me. I have a lot of potential.\n\nI do like other dogs. I do better with middle aged dogs...ones who will play with me and yet not be too wild and crazy. I am learning a LOT from my furry foster friend Jazz. She is an old timer, and she is my best buddy. I look to her for guidance. I am much more confident dog when she is around. Foster mom says I need to have an medium to large doggie companion in my next home to help me continue to gain confidence and learn appropriate behaviors. I will also require a nice yard with privacy fence. I am not a candidate for leash walking...I need a yard to run around and let out my energy.\n\nI am crate trained and thrive on structure. I really am a diamond in the rough. I am looking forward to finding a new family that sees my potential and will help me become an even better dog. I promise you years of adventures and love.\n\nCome and meet me soon! I look forward to meeting you!\n\nFor more information on our adoptable pet list please visit: Adoptable Pet List\n\nPlease join us at our next Event(s):\n\nCurrent Scheduled Events:",

Once you meet her, you\u2019ll fall in love with those warm eyes.  \n\nShe is 5 years old, about 50 pounds, UTD on vaccines, microchipped, in good health, spayed, housebroken and has such a classy lookin\u2019 black and white coat.\n\nHer body language communicates her desire to bond and clearly indicates if she\u2019s feeling uneasy.  So much of the world is new to Lilly.  Her past included very little social time; many sounds and situations are new to her.\n\nThroughout her year with Lucky Paws Rescue, she has put her right paw forward in all endeavors.  Her confidence has grown ten-fold.  She is a true companion dog.\n\nLilly can be shy and sometimes on edge when experiencing new social situations and sounds.  She\u2019s done an impressive job of working through her hesitancies.  With the support of professional dog trainers, Lilly has conquered many new life chapters.  She now realizes trucks make loud noises but will not harm her and she has developed wonderful leash skills when walking through the neighborhood and even retail stores.\n\nThe Cedar River Dog Farm training team have found Lilly loves intermittent down-times.  She adores being wrapped in a cozy blanket, likes to hang out in open-door crate and feels more confident when wearing a weighted vest.\n\nGiven some transition time, Lilly is a true cuddler!  She\u2019s been known to climb right into your lap, take a nap near your feet and, if invited, will lay in bed by your side.\n\nLilly is looking for a low-key home with a fenced yard, sorry no kids or cats.  A very balanced family dog may offer her a great partnership.  Lilly\u2019s first choice is to be the only dog so she can soak up all the love. \n\nLilly loves physical activity and relishes opportunities for agility play.  She has impressive dexterity skills, loves jumping on large tree stumps, hurdles, ramps, bridges and even climbing a ladder!   \n\nLilly needs a new foster or forever home before Valentine\u2019s Day.  Trainer support will continue when she moves to her new environment.\n\nIf you are interested in Lily, please copy/paste the link below into your internet browser to fill out our application:\n\nhttp://form.jotform.us/form/50488470409157\n",

He is completely ready to move in your house and steal not just your heart, but also your bed!\n\nWynston is a very smart dog and currently knows sit, shake, off, leave it, kennel, and come. In typical bully fashion he has a wiggly wiggly behind and needs time to adjust to a new environment. \n\nWynston does well with other dogs but does need a proper introduction, same with cats! At first glance we thought there was no way he could live with cats, but after he learned they weren't fun toys to chase, he co exists just fine. This guy does need a fenced yard!\n\nThis big boy is everything you could want. Smooshy and cuddly, energetic and playful, goofy and entertaining! Wynston is one of our longer dog residents here and we would love to see him finally get into his furever home. \n\nWynston is UTD on shots, preventative, micro-chipped, and neutered!\n\nWynston\u2019s adoption fee is $250, and adopters must live within 175 miles of the Quad City Area.\n\nIf interested in meeting Wynstonyou must fill out the online application at www.k9kindnessrescue.org/adopt/application\n\nWynston and K9 Kindness Rescue thank you for considering adoption",

Cats TBD.\n\nGSRA adopts to residents of VA, NC, and SC only\n\nHello, my name is Captain and my foster Mom says I am a perfect older gentleman. I was found tied to a tree with a large metal chain, now I know that sounds sad but that has not made me dislike people. I love everyone I meet. Especially if they have treats or a ball. I do not like to be crated. and unfortunately my foster parents learned that the hard way when I broke the door off. I just really enjoy sleeping on a comfy floor and being near. my people. I would do best in a house or an apartment with NO stairs. Being an older distinguished gentleman stairs are a bit tough because of my arthritis and hips. I still love to go on walks but no hiking or jogging. I do get along with my foster fur-sister but do not really sure how to play right now. I would love to be the only dog in the house so you can spoil me rotten in my golden days. I do not have the best house manners right now because it is all new to me. So don't be mad if I go into an open pantry and try to help myself! No worries, I do correct easily with a firm NO!.\n\nIf you want someone to make you their world I am totally your guy. Don't let my age fool you. I am young at heart and I've got a ton of love left to give!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Captain will not be placed in an adoptive home until medically cleared as we are addressing some ear issues and will be seeing a specialist. After that he will need to go thru heartworm treatment.For more information on our adoptable pet list please visit: Adoptable Pet List\n\nPlease join us at our next Event(s):\n\nCurrent Scheduled Events:",

            "description": "Gracie is located in TEXAS. There are not enough homes for all the unwanted dogs down there, so she is willing to relocate for a good, loving, forever home.\n\nGracie was saved from a fast kill, small-town dog pound. She is a Blue Lacy Mix, 3-1/2 years old and weighing 40 pounds. She has the distinctive Lacy bark. We discovered that she had already been spayed and had a microchip (the pound did not scan her).  The contact for her microchip had \"rehomed\" her, and that person never updated the chip. Her original owner says that she had to rehome Gracie because she was growling at the kids. We think the kids were probably giving her a reason to growl at them. Regardless, Gracie is probably not a good fit for homes with very young children. Gracie is housetrained, crate trained, and knows how to sit. She tolerates well-mannered dogs but is an alpha and will put annoying ones in their place. She would probably do best paired with a male dog that respects her space. Gracie likes to run and explore and will play a bit with other dogs. She is very food motivated and loves to eat. Her portions must be monitored. She guards her food and treats from other dogs, so food must be kept separate.  When we got her, Gracie was missing fur on her butt and tail area. This was flea bite Dermatitis. We gave her a flea pill and her fur is now completely grown back.  It would be best if potential adopters were familiar with the breed. Gracie must be in the house as a loved member of the family. She must have a securely fenced yard to run and play.\n\nGracie is healthy. She is spayed, fully vaccinated, and microchipped. She is negative for heartworms and on monthly heartworm and flea preventative. Gracie has a  $500.00 adoption fee that includes transport to Brewster NY, Nanuet NY, or Rocky Hill CT. She is being fostered in Texas and will not be sent north until after she is adopted. Please email  2 Many Dogs Rescue for an adoption application if you are interested in adopting this pretty girl.

Thankfully a rescuer was at the vet and intervened and Shanook was saved from certain death.\n\nShanook is approximately 13 yrs old\nNeutered, UTD and hw negative\nDoesn't mind cats \nOk with female dogs and small dogs.  \nTends to be aggressive towards male dogs.\nWould be fine as an only dog\nGood on a leash\nGood manners about food.\n\nHe is older and has some quirks.  His ideal home would be with someone who is home to spend time with him.  A physically fenced in yard for him to explore and a couch to crash on and a doggy door to allow him indoor and outdoor access.  He's still the absolute sweetest and deserves to live his final years feeling loved and adored, something he has lacked most of his life.  If you just want a companion dog, this is your guy!\n\nHis adoption fee is sponsored for the right family, but you still have to go through our adoption process.  Shanook is located in middle TN.  You must fill out our adoption application form to be considered.  It is on our website at www.safehaventn.com and we are happy to arrange a meet and greet once your application has been approved.\n\n",

            "description": "Madre #7188 is a 3-year-old female Shepherd mix. She is a friendly and outgoing lady. She absolutely loves people and will jump up to meet you. For this reason, she should be in a home without young children as she might accidentally jump on them in her excitement. Madre is good with other dogs. She is crate trained and also responds to the \u201csit\u201d command. She is extremely treat-motivated; this will be a great way to work on her training. She does tend to pull a bit on the leash because she is so excited to explore. Madre is extremely high-energy and will need an outlet for plenty of exercise or a fenced-in backyard. She came to us with puppies and heartworms. Now she is ready for some much-needed R&R and a family who will continue LCAR\u2019s provided Heartworm treatment at no cost. She weighs 60 pounds and is full grown. This pup is microchipped. We believe you can always teach an \u2018old\u2019 dog new tricks, so we highly recommend continued obedience training for this smart pup; it stimulates the dog's mind and establishes a good dog/adopter relationship. This pup, like all pups, should be on heartworm preventative; an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. If you are interested in adopting this dog, and are already approved to adopt through our organization, please contact dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with the pup\u2019s name and ID number in the subject line. OTHERWISE, please submit an adoption application online: http://www.lastchanceanimalrescue.org/adoptus.html E-mail dogs@lastchanceanimalrescue.org with questions. Stay tuned to our Facebook page for updates: www.facebook.com/LCARMD #adoptlove #PicMe #petsmartcharities",

            "description": "Scar is about 1.5 years old. He is a very sweet, affectionate and driven boy. He is learning quickly and is doing well at his foster home. He gets along well with dogs but has high prey drive, so cats are for chasing, not living with. Scar would do great in a home that can give him plenty of exercise and mental stimulation. He could do well at any dog sport. He's gentle with his teeth and does great with kids. \n\nScar's foster dad says that he eats a lot and plays even more! Scar is incredibly excited to greet him every day. He follows family members around throughout the day. In true Mal fashion, Scar is very intelligent. He's attentive to his handler, and does almost everything he's asked to do; sit, lay, down, up... He is crate trained and sleeps throughout the night. No accidents. He does get the happy pees when he gets super excited, so his foster has been working on this with him by having him calm down before giving him any attention (as best you can with a Mal). Did we mention that he is great with other dogs? :o)\n\nHe is a little protective over his bone, but not aggressive. He just doesn't want to share. Scar is a young dog with lots of potential who will excel in just about anything!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please complete an application at this link https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/24689/generic . \n\nWe are an official 501C3 organziation that does not have a physical location.

His mature adult owner moved in with her family who has children and Krispy was not happy. He is not good with children or cats. He.needs a calm adult home with a regular schedule and time to spend with him. He is loving and gives kisses once he trusts you and he will let you know when he needs to go potty. The vet said he is blind in one eye possibly from head trauma Krispy can see with the other eye and doesn't walk into anything, we address him from his sited side so he knows we are approaching him for cuddles. We do feel he would be best as an only dog so he can get all the loving. He will be getting a dental cleaning and then ready for his home. He is 8-9 years old. and 13 pounds. He is small and muscular. A FAB walking buddy! Krispy's adoption fee is $300 to go towards his vetting (vaccines, spay/neuter, heartworm/Ehrlichia/Lyme test, fecal test, pre-op blood work, dental cleaning, and microchip as well as grooming if needed). If you are interested please fill out the adoption application For additional information regarding our adoption process, please check our FAQ's Page. \n\n *All dogs in the care of Get a Life Pet Rescue live in loving foster homes while waiting for their perfect match.

They are treated as family pets while in our care. * All dogs in our care are fed premium brand holistic food as well as supplements and vitamins specific to each dog's needs. We don't buy inexpensive bulk dry kibble, our rescues are fed premium wet food diets as part of a comprehensive rehabilitation program to ensure maximum health.*All of our rescues receive complete quality vetting including full dental cleaning with pre-op bloodwork, spay/neuter, vaccines, and grooming. Dogs in need of specialized medicine will be seen by specialists, such as full cardiac workups, ophthalmologist visits, all suspicious lumps, and bumps are biopsied, and every medical need is transparent to potential adopters. *Once you adopt from Get a Life Pet Rescue, you become part of our compassionate family and we are here for you if a problem with your precious dog arises.",

            "description": "Austin has had a rough start to 2020 and is looking for humans who will make a much brighter future. He is a 31.2 pound tall and lanky boy with tons of energy to run off! Austin is a 1 year old Vizla mix who needs a home with a strong leader who is\ncommitted\nto working with and training him. He had previously been adopted from another rescue but soon found himself escaping out of his home and wandering the streets. Luckily HARTT (Humane Animal Rescue Trapping Team) got involved and was able to successfully trap him. Austin was found in a storm gutter fearing humans and needing to relearn how to trust. Sadly his adopters no longer wanted Austin and we had the pleasure of taking in this goofy boy. He loves to play with other dogs of all sizes but does need a proper introduction first, so any other dogs in the home will need to meet him prior to adoption. He can become possessive of his people towards other dogs but responds well to verbal corrections, so he will need ongoing work with that if there are other dogs in his home. Austin is very shy and will need time and patience to make friends with humans. He prefers women to men, so he may take more time to warm up to any men in the home. He is looking for a home with only adults and older teens as children spook him. Austin has done well with cats but will try to play with them, so would do best with confident, dog savvy cats. He is getting better on the leash each time he goes out but will need additional training as he adjusts in his forever home. Austin will need a vigilant home that will keep Austin safe and off the streets. He is kennel trained, but will need ongoing work on his potty training. No apartments or rentals with breed or weight restrictions. He is neutered, up to date on vaccines, microchipped and vet checked. His adoption fee of $160 includes a free vet visit. To potentially adopt Austin,\n\nplease fill out an application (found here: https://azsmalldog.org/adoption-forms/) and send to\n\nfosterdogboots@gmail.com",

            "description": "MILLIE: 18 months old, 38lbs (As of 12/15), Boxer Mix, Spayed Female, Medium to Higher Active \n\nShe goes from 0 to 100 in the blink of an awestruck eye. Her movements are tight. Shes a muscular little machine built for whip like romping, and she needs a playmate who can keep her on her toes. Millie is 18 months old, only 38 lbs, and shes got nipples for days. This boxer/beagle mix has clearly been used as a puppy machine her entire short life, so now that shes got a chance to be an independent woman, her engine is revving with youthful energy. She wants to frolic, rumble, pounce, and dash then flop over for belly rubs and cuddles. Shes fueled by sweetness, very treat motivated, and learns fast. Shell need plenty of exercise and some basic training to keep her adult dog manners on the right track, and shes super responsive to direction so shell make a star student. Millie could also use some socialization work with other dogs her size and bigger, sometimes they bug her out and she doesnt know how to say hello politely. Shell shine in an active experienced home, older kids or grownups only since shes a little clumsy and might accidentally hurt someone small.\n\nHer foster mom says: Millie is doing great! We've worked up to a good amount of time in the crate, and she's doing amazing with it. I'm also working on sit, stay, and no mouthing while playing commands. She's making some progress! She literally rolls over and demands a belly rub every time she sees any of my doormen, so we're also working on that too. Sometimes it makes for an awkward moment when they don't want to pet or they're busy, but it's SO cute most people can't resist. :) Also, she would be amazing for a family that loves to sleep in this pup will happily sleep in until 9 or 10 and be okay waiting to use the bathroom. I've never met a dog that sleeps so late! Interested in adopting? Submit an application at socialteesnyc.org or email your point person if youve already been approved!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This animal is not at the Social Tees office all of our dogs and cats are in foster homes while they wait to find their forever families. :) If youd like to apply to adopt this pet, please complete an adoption application at socialteesnyc.org. Because we are a small team and receive hundreds of applications each week, we are unable to respond to every application and every inquiry email, but we do our best. Please have patience! If your application is approved, you will for sure hear from us. If you have questions, please take a look at the Adoption and Fostering FAQs etc. on our website as all common questions are answered there.

            "description": "Are you looking for the love of your life, who will give you all of his attention? The sweetest boy, who uses a wheelchair to get around, and is working so hard to gain mobility back in his hind legs? Well, then Thurmond is your guy. Thurmond so sweet and needs a family that is able to help him get around and give him lots of attention. He would prefer a home without toddler age children who may try grab him. Thurmond's perfect day would be spending time outside in the wheelchair to explore the yard and find sticks to chew on, laying in the sun and then enjoying some couch life, snuggles and attention. Thurmond is ready to be your best friend. He loves other dogs and all people.\n\nAge: 6-years-old\n\nBreed: Lab Mix\n\nWeight: 53 lbs\n\nKid-friendly: Unknown (older considerate kids should be OK)\n\nDogs: Yes! Being fostered with 2 other dogs\n\nCats: Likes to chase cats, so probably not\n\nCrate trained: Thurmond does not like being crated, but he's a great guy and doesn't get into anything. He can't jump so he can't get on furniture and as long as he has a blanket that's where he hangs out.\n\nPotty trained: Yes, with exceptions. While there have not been accidents when the fosters were away from the home, there have been a few times he wasn't able to hold it while the fosters were getting him ready to go out/ they weren't quick enough. Thurmond will tell you he needs to go out by licking your hands, but ultimately he does his poops immediately after his meals.\n\nHealth concerns: His back legs currently don't work too well, so he uses a wheelchair to get around. We have seen progress and do hope he'll regain full strength in his back legs. As of right now he had open wounds that came from him dragging his legs that we have had to tend to, we're almost all healed up but still require bandaging and will most likely need to wear protective boots or socks once he is fully healed to prevent more injury. He is heart worm positive and in the process of completing his treatment.\n\nAdoption fee: $325\n\nOur dogs receive heartworm and flea/tick prevention the first week of each month, March through November. Dogs that have stage 3 or 4 dental disease will receive a dental procedure in rescue. We aspirate all lumps and remove those that our veterinary partners suggest removing.\n\nAdopters will be responsible for continued preventatives, follow-up appointments, and medications (if applicable).\n\n$50 discount for seniors (65+) and veterans. Adoption fees help pay for the dog's veterinary exam, vaccinations (rabies, distemper, and bordetella), HW test, blood panel, a microchip, and spay/neuter if needed and additional health needs specific to each animal.\n\nYou can apply to adopt at www.greyfacerescue.org/adoption-application",

He doesn\u2019t have a mean bone in him, he\u2019s super affectionate and will Velcro to his momma. He loves to cuddle and will be very loyal to her forever person. \n\nMerlin is currently living in a foster care with two toy breed dogs, two cats, and older kids - and she\u2019s great with all but would really do best in a household with another large breed canine playmate to run and play with. \nHe loves to play with the other dogs so has frequent dog play date sessions.\n\nHe can be timid at first with new people, but warms up quickly. Especially if there are treats involved!! He is so super food motivated!\n\nMerlin is 100% puppy and craves constant attention. Prior to coming into rescue he lived outside with his sister, stormy, for the first year of his life. He has no formal training and will need a patient family to show him the way. The two biggest things his foster family is currently working on with him are potty training and not jumping on everyone. He loves treats so it\u2019s a good motivation for him to learn. \n\nwhen we first got him in, he was terrified of being on a leash and collar. We have been working to desensitize him and make walking on leash a fun activity and he\u2019s doing so much better.\n\nMerlin has been fully vaccinated, neutered, and micro chipped.\n\nTo read over our adoption requirements and apply to adopt Merlin, please go to: www.nwflgdr.com/adopt. \n\nMerlin\u2018s adoption fee is $400.\n\nATTENTION: If you are applying from out of area or out of state, understand that if your application gets approved, you will be expected to pick up the dane in the location that he/she is being fostered. In addition, if the adoption does not work out, it is your responsibility to bring the dane safely back to us.",

            "description": "We could all use some (safe) socialization after 2020 isolation, right? Our boy Gitmo is the perfect pup to make that happen. This handsome guy loves people (including kiddos), dogs of all sizes, and even cats! Whether you're needing a Sunday patio brunch date, or a day date at the park, Gitmo is your man. He's housebroken and crate trained, so none of those embarrassing moments in front of guests. He's learning and loving fetch too! Adopt Gitmo today and become the social butterfly of 2021.\n\nGitmo is about 3 years old and weighs about 45 pounds.\n\nIf you're interested in meeting Gitmo, please visit our website to learn about our adoption process and to fill out an application, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs and cats will be micro-chipped, spayed or neutered, and up-to-date on vaccinations at the time of adoption. For more photos of Gitmo, follow us on Facebook Gateway Pet Guardians and Instagram @gatewaypets ... #gpgGitmo. \n\nTo view other adoptable pets from our shelter, please visit, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nGateway Pet Guardians is proud to offer a variety of mixed breed dogs available for adoption. However, please keep in mind that we rarely know the genetic background of the animals we rescue and, as such, we cannot guarantee the exact breed combinations found within this dog. However, we do not know his/her actual genetic makeup. Just know that this dog is probably a variety of several different breeds that have combined to create one very amazing and unique animal.",

She didn't get a lot of attention in her previous home so she got used to being alone and is very shy when meeting new people. She is doing well with us now, but her new owner will need to give her time to adjust. She is housebroken, up to date on vaccines and microchipped. She gets along with other dogs but would be happy being the center of attention. Marshie loves to cuddle once she is comfortable and she loves to curl up under the blankets. Marshie is quiet and calm most of the time and sometimes we even get worried she is lost because she is just sleeping under a blanket and we don't see her! This cutie would love a quiet home to relax with her people! Please fill put an application at http://tinyurl.com/DominoApply",

            "description": "Millie is one of our dogs that has been through a lot. Previous to her Grey Face rescue, Millie had been severely neglected, which led to untreated dental abscesses that became so severe, that they created open and painful wounds in her face. Because of Millie's neglect, it takes her some time to develop trust with new humans. Millie's perfect adopter would be patient and kind, and have a quiet home. They would allow her to acclimate slowly, and give her lots of bacon and love.\n\nOnce you have gained Millie's trust, she is a very sweet and low maintenance dog. She really loves being pet, including ear and butt scratches. Millie also loves walks, and sniffing around, and did we mention bacon? She is perfectly potty-trained and does well left out to explore during the day. She is a pretty quiet dog, but she will let you know if a stranger or other dog is outside. She has the cutest little \"awoo\" whenever she is left alone, just so you don't forget about her. Millie is very unsure of other dogs and cats. Her initial reaction is to growl and keep them as far away from her as possible. We are recommending a home without other pets.\n\nAge: 7-years-old\n\nBreed: Shar-Pei Mix\n\nWeight: 34 lbs\n\nKid-friendly: Potentially, after very long and slow introductions (older, respectful children)\n\nDogs: No animals in adopter's home is highly recommended\n\nCats: No animals in adopter's home is highly recommended\n\nCrate trained: Not kenneled in foster home, but can be trusted to be left out during the day\n\nPotty trained: Absolutely! Can hold it for 10-11 hours\n\nLikes: Food! Millie loves human food of any kind, Greenies, Milkbones, bacon, etc. She only seems to enjoy toys that have food inside of them. Very much likes human attention, walks, and sniffing.\n\nHealth concerns: HW+, open wounds on face that are healing - need to be cleaned daily\n\nAdoption fee: $325\n\nOur dogs receive heartworm and flea/tick prevention the first week of each month, March through November. Dogs that have stage 3 or 4 dental disease will receive a dental procedure in rescue. We aspirate all lumps and remove those that our veterinary partners suggest removing.\n\nAdopters will be responsible for continued preventatives, follow-up appointments, and medications (if applicable).\n\n$50 discount for seniors (65+) and veterans. Adoption fees help pay for the dog's veterinary exam, vaccinations (rabies, distemper, and bordetella), HW test, blood panel, a microchip, and spay/neuter if needed and additional health needs specific to each animal.\n\nYou can apply to adopt at www.greyfacerescue.org/adoption-application",

I hope you like snuggles, because boy I sure do like my belly rubbed and being close to you! We can Netflix and cuddle... Have you heard about zoomies?? Because once I'm comfortable in my surroundings I really enjoy zoomin around!! I am pretty much the classic Hollywood star, I love being pampered and getting attention, but I don't mind getting my paws a little dirty! So if you feel like having that Bonnie and Clyde duo, I'm your gal! I just would have to be your only pal.. hopefully that's okay with you? I'm sort of the alpha around these woods.\n\nBonnie weighs about 65 lbs, and is around 4 years old. She is up to date on all vaccines, spayed, and HW negative. She is not good with cats and is dog selective, so it is best she be an only pet.",

She loves her soft and cuddly bed and was so excited to have one of her very own!  Sunflower is fully vaccinated, microchipped, current on vaccinations, fecal testing, and dvm exam.  She is not a good fit for cats, and she does best with children over 13 years old and with calmer dogs in the household.  \n\nSunflower came to us all the way from Thailand in partnership with SOI Dog Foundation.  Sunflower was a victim of a cruelty case....here is some more information about her when was was in Thailand:\n\"Beautiful Sunflower was found in a world of unbearable suffering after someone slashed her across the head and body. It was a deliberate, savage attack on a defenseless dog.  The wounds were seriously infected and over time, they became infested with maggots. She was in so much pain. It took months of medical treatment and tender loving care to heal not just her physical wounds, but her fear and confusion. Thankfully, she recovered and has now, all thanks to generous animal lovers like you, left the Soi Dog shelter for her new life overseas.\" \n\nSunflower is available for adoption through WPFC.  Please submit an adoption application if you are interested in her.  She will have a few additional adoption requirements as a SOI Dog adoption partner- we will provide that information to potential adoption applicants.\n",

Chauncey is pretty laid back, enjoys a nice walk,  and will also be happy to binge watch Netflix with you.  Chauncey is ok with other dogs as long as they are not in your face since Chauncey is more interested in chilling and not playing.  Chauncey needs a cat free home and a fenced in yard.  \nIf you feel he may be a good match please fill out the application in comments!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please apply online, at https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/. \n\nOur main website, www.bigfluffydogs.com has more information about us and the rescue process. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters should understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. Homes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for 1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (i.e. a 4-month-old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break). 2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise. 3.) Socialization.  The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home. 4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded ten-fold, for years to come.  Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy.  Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time-consuming and can be expensive. All dogs require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well-socialized dog is more than worth the effort to get them there.",

Heidi.nichols@ymail.com\nGriffin, 2 years old and 51 pounds of pure cuddle, is available for adoption. If you are looking for a dog who is loyal, loving, and responsive, he is your guy!  He loves playing fetch, tug-o\u2019-war with his toys, walks, and snuggles.  Griff likes treats so much he will sit and lay down for them!  Not sure how he feels about other animals since we don\u2019t have any, but he is great with people. Completely HOUSEBROKEN. We have left him out and about in our house when we leave without problem. While Griffin is more than happy to snuggle and sleep with the humans he does sleep in his own bed at night. Please message me if you are interested in adopting this sweet boy.",

He warms up much quicker to kiddos and has loved all the ones he has met so far!\n\u2022\tA fenced yard to play with his pack in!\n\u2022\tSomeone with patience, Clifford has come SO SO far but will still take time to warm up. It may take him a couple of weeks to begin trusting his new environment and people, so someone who is able to give him the time and space to come to them will be a must! \n\nClifford just needs to be treated like a dog. No special treatment or babying. He has had a hard life but just needs a patient and consistent human, a mentor dog or two and time to open up! He is such a sweet guy and we know the perfect home is out there for him!\n\n**Clifford will only be adopted to a home with other dogs and a fenced yard, so that he can continue to grow and thrive!**\n\n\nPLEASE READ COMPLETELY \n\nAll of our kids are being raised in volunteer foster homes, so we do not have a single location to visit.

Due to his age, Homer is partially blind and hard of hearing but that does not stop him from navigating his surroundings. He can see objects and finds his way around very well. He also loves human affection and long naps during the day. This very sweet senior boy is currently accepting adoption application. Come meet Homer today!\n\nMORE DETAILS:\n\nThis dog must live indoors.\n\nAll dogs and puppies at Raccoon River Pet Rescue (RRPR) have been spayed/neutered, have age appropriate vaccinations, microchipped, and treated for fleas, ear mites, and worms.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete an online adoption application at www.RaccoonRiverPetRescue.com and select menu option 'Adoption'. Serious applications only please. Applications will be considered in the order we receive them.\n\nOnce an application has been submitted, a member of the RRPR team will contact you usually within 24 hours. Please be patient and thank you for your interest in adopting with us!\n\nQuestions? Email us at RRPRmanager@gmail.com or call (515) 465-1800.",

He is so amazing and loves other dogs and kids and is sweet as can be.  He's eating well and totally recovered.  He's a pretty easy boy to take care of.  He likes to gently run around with the other dogs in his foster home but is pretty low energy.  Loves his naps and chicken and would love a home by the end of the year.  He loves affection and to give the other dogs kisses.  He's easy to care for and would be fine in an apartment as long as he gets out for some short walks and potty breaks a few times a day.\n\nNo long work hours or crazy hyper dogs.  Not sure about cats.  \n\nIf you'd like to see more of Houston, check our ingstram: @lisachiarelli and @karlaspack, his foster.  \n\nSorry, but will not respond to emails sent to Petfinder.  If you're interested in adopting Houston and meet the requirements, please fill out an application at frankielolaandfriends.com and we'll get back to you.- THANKS\n\n",

            "description": "Skye is a high energy Catahoula Leopard Dog, and true to her breed, she loves to work and can get into a bit of trouble if left to her own devices for too long.  She is a double merle and deaf, and as a result is quite vocal - she doesn't realize how loud she can be! Her barks can be alarming to others at first, so slow and distant first introductions are necessary. Skye understands basic sign commands and does well with a routine. \n\nSkye is a very active dog who needs plenty of exercise and mental stimulation every single day. Her current routine involves 10-12km spread out into a few walks and sometimes trips to the forest where she enjoys off leash time. She also loves to run, retrieve and play. Skye gets along with some dogs, often preferring large male dogs to medium-small dogs or females. Skye suffers from separation anxiety, and along with her daily exercise and mental stimulation, she takes anti-anxiety medication which has changed her life so much for the better! \n\nThough this diva asks a lot of her guardian, she will reward you by acting like a 10lb lap dog and nuzzling up to you on the couch to watch a movie, she'll sleep with you too, but is also kennel trained. Skye is a loyal dog, she loves her people. She's great with older kids who can handle her high energy and bounciness. \n \nSkye is looking for the right person or family who will continue to work with her to help her be her best doggo!  She needs an active home with someone who is determined to keep up with her reward based fear free training and have patience with her. Dog experience required, breed experience a definite asset. \n \nIf you're interested in adopting Skye, please apply! To do so click on the 'More about Us' button, then click the link to apply and scroll to the bottom of the page where it says Adoption application: Dog. \n\n*no cats\n*no young children\n*no small dogs",

Visit our FAQ webpage for commonly asked questions about our adoption/foster process.\nHi my name is Puppy! I know that sounds like a silly name but its been my name for 8 years. I came with my daddy Chico when my owner was no longer able to care for me. We were pretty scared for a few days but we really like our foster home. We have a large yard to explore and other dogs to play with if we choose. I always choose a lap! That is my favorite place. If one lap is not available I will choose another. I love people and seem to enjoy attention from children also. I am learning to play with a few toys and also enjoy a game of chase. The big dogs at my foster home are okay as long as they don't invade my space. I am working on potty training and am doing much better if you watch my cues. I really want a special forever home with warm laps and my daddy Chico. I missed him terribly when he was ill in the hospital. I will be ready for adoption when Chico is all set. I will be available in January after my spay.Last Day Dog Rescue now microchips all animals before adoption. Microchips are implanted between the animals shoulder blades and are a permanent form of identification. The microchips are registered to Last Day Dog Rescue with the adopter's info added once adopted. If the animal is ever lost and slips his/her collar/tags the microchip allows the finder to know who to contact if scanned for a microchip. Animals MUST still have a collar with tags on at all times. Per our contract, we take all our animals back if for any reason you can't keep your adopted animal.\n\nPlease understand the statements about this animal are based upon the foster home's evaluation of the animal. The animal might behave differently (negatively or positively) in your home. While the animal might be good with the current foster's dogs, cats, children, etc., it may not be with your animal(s) or children. The animal may be housebroken or litter trained in the home of the foster but may relapse in your home. The animal is represented to the public as it performs in the foster home and any statements made regarding the animal are conditional to that foster home setting. Please understand that statements made regarding this animal are simply overviews and are not guaranteed.\n\nThe Petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our animals. Visual breed identification in animals is unreliable so for most of the animals we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each animal as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our animals based on personality, not by breed label.\n\nThank you for looking through our list of animals needing forever homes and choosing rescue first.

I love people and even kids though probably best with children older than toddlers. I love going on short walks with the big dogs in my foster home. I am not a yappy small dog but I can volunteer as your doorbell. I will be best in a home where my people are not gone for many hours. I love to be close to my people. My daughter Puppy must go to my forever home with me as we have always been together and she really misses me if I am gone. We are very different but like to be there for each other. It will likely be several weeks before I'm ready for my special home as I have been battling a respiratory infection and will need my teeth cared for and a neuter before I go.Last Day Dog Rescue now microchips all animals before adoption.

Owning a dog is a huge responsibility that is not something that should be rushed into. Each dog from Rescued Treasures has been saved from an uncertain future. If you are thinking about adopting, please remember it is a LIFE-LONG commitment. Dogs can live to be at least 14 years old...are you ready to take care of him/her that long?\n\nNala is a beautiful sweet girl, she delivered 11 puppies and is ready to find her forever home. Her eyes seem to speak a thousand words, with a big story to tell. She is looking for the comfort of a forever home. She does well with bigger dogs, older kids but no small dogs or cats. Nala is housebroke, crate trained, she loves car rides and walks.\nCould you be a forever home for her?!",

I'm Ashton, and I'm a 10-month-old some have described as \"needing to learn manners\" but I prefer to think of as EXUBERANT and FUN-LOVING! I'm really, really excited to meet you!. You will love me; I guarantee it! In fact, I will insist upon it! You know us Border Collies are super-smart - some say smarter than a 7-year-old human! - and my person will get all the benefit of my brainpower, and more importantly, the super-heart that goes with it! \n\nBeing a super smarty pants means that I can learn anything and super fast so I am a training dream! However, if my brain isn't stimulated, I will find my own enrichment and I have been told I don't always make the best choices! I'll need a family that can keep me on my toes! An adult only home or a home with older kiddos would be best. I would love a dog pal but that would be dependent on a meet and greet here at the shelter. Ready for some high-IQ love? \n\nTo enable us to hold Ashton for a meet and greet with you, a $25.00 deposit will be taken at the time you make an appointment. Your deposit will be credited toward your adoption if you choose to adopt, or refunded after your meet and greet if you decide that this pet is not a good match for you. Deposits will not be refunded if you cancel less than twenty-four hours before your appointment time.",

Some were dumped, abandoned in an empty house, left tied to a tree, picked up by animal control as strays, or simply unwanted by their owners. We ask that only serious and committed adopters apply as these dogs have suffered enough.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this pet please apply to adopt at\nhttp://www.wagsandwhiskerspetrescue.com/adopt.html\nif the pet is still available for adoption and you are approved to adopt we will contact you to set up a meet and greet appointment.",

He's eager to get his chance at a fresh start here in Vacationland! He is incredibly snuggly, loves to give kisses, and is very loyal to his humans. He does well with female dogs but has had complications getting along with male dogs. He's working on his manners around cats in his foster home. Looking to start off your new year with a new companion? Cider may be perfect for you! Apply now!",

PHONE CALLS AND EMAILS WILL NOT BE RETURNED IN TIMELY MANNER**\n\nwww.barkmn.org\n\nApplicants who have contact in-home or frequent contact with children will be denied. No exceptions. \n\nBrewster is a 5 yr old, 7.5lb male Chihuahua with a few trust issues. He has fear aggression and mild resource guarding (growls at other dogs if they get close to \"his\" stuff) type of issues. He was going to be euthanized for this behavior at the shelter but he has made a lot of progress in his foster home and is really coming out of his shell! He will need a very specific forever home with a very calm, confident person who can continue making progress with him. He is starting to show his personality, inviting dogs into play, and enjoys attention from his person! \n\n\nBrewster\u2019s perfect person: \n\n-Does not live in a home with walls shared with neighbors. Brewster will alert bark to any voices and is terrified of strangers. \n\n-Does not have other animals. He is currently housed with other dogs and is slowly learning to \u201cplay\u201d but he is pretty controlling while \u201cplaying\u201d and can turn growl/snap at another dog if they\u2019re too rough or get near \u201chis\u201d things. He\u2019s a very vocal player also which seems to confuse some dogs. Essentially, his dog to dog communication skills need practice. The cat makes him very angry but he will tolerate their presence if need be. He tolerates other dogs but does not often seek out their company. He\u2019s perfectly ok being a loner! \n\n-Someone who has a solid foundation and understanding of dog behavior and who is committed to ongoing training and treating Brewster like a DOG.  \n\n- Someone who understands what  it means to own a dog like Brewster. He can never be left alone with children. Luckily he loves being in his crate and kennels easily upon command. He would do best with only one or two adults in the house. \n\n- A fenced yard. He has recently been allowed off leash to potty and he discovered zoomies are fun! He would love a safe place to run around! He will startle when he hears someone outside the fence and will attempt to run back inside or posture/bark at them. \n\n- Someone PATIENT. He did try to food-strike and not eat when stressed, initially, but he now knows that if he runs to his kennel like the other dogs and sits, he will receive his meals. He understands that he has to work for his meals or other desirable rewards and understands a few other \u201cmannerly\u201d dog things like sitting before allowed out of his kennel and walking nicely on the leash . His foster mom can easily pick him up, trim a nail or two, hand feed him, go for long walks (he LOVES walks) but it does take a while to get there with him. He has never offered to bite his foster family and now tries to beg for attention by climbing the baby gates to be near them.  \n\nBrewster is kennel trained and easily crates for a work day. He happily greets his familiar people when they get home. He gains confidence in himself and his environment daily so we\u2019re looking for the perfect person who can give him the safest forever home possible! \n\nAdoption fee negotiable to the right home. \n\n",

As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals or how large puppies will be when fully grown.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our 'Visit' page for hours and directions to our shelter.

            "description": "This is Baxter!\n\nBaxter was found as a stray and taken to OC Shelter. As a blind dog, we can only imagine how scared he must have been! Baxter is 13 years old and weighs 22 lbs. Volunteers have taken him on a few outings and report he's a little nervous in the car, but once he's out, he's a happy boy!\n\nOne of our regular volunteers took Baxter on a two week Frosted Fling so we could learn how he does in a home environment. The answer is: Baxter is the best boy! His Fling Mom reports Baxter is potty trained and sleeps in a crate at night with no accidents. The only time he makes any noise is in the morning when he needs to go out, and he lets out a funny little howl. Baxter is a good eater who enjoys going for walks, napping in the sun, and cuddling. Baxter gets along great with his lab fling brother. Be sure to watch the video to see Baxter finding his way around in his Fling home and going for a walk. Being blind doesn't keep him from getting around inside or on walks!\n\nBaxter's Fling Mom shared, \"Baxter is the cutest little darling boy, and his face simply melts your heart. Baxter is so well-behaved. He is sleeping now after enjoying the beautiful sunset and getting exercise walking laps in the yard. His perfect forever family will feed him lots of food because he loves to eat, that look and head tilt when he smells food makes you laugh. He will enjoy short walkies during the day, kisses on his head and a warm comfy place where he will sleep through the night. He's the best boy and very, very quiet! He and his big lab fling brother have gotten along super from day one.\"\n\nBaxter is ready to be a wonderful addition to your family! Apply to meet him: www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nVisit us at Open House: Saturdays & Sundays, 10 am - 1 pm.\n\nLearn more about our programs at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family. No adoption fees, and we help with medical costs!\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\nUpdated 1/31/21 KG",

Dudley is currently 10 months old and around 35 pounds. When full grown, Dudley is expected to be a medium sized dog. His adorable shorter coat comes from his cattle dog and terrier mix. Dudley loves everyone! He does well with other dogs, cats, and kids! Plus he\u2019s crate trained! Dudley is VERY energetic! He needs a lot of exercise and would do best with an ACTIVE lifestyle with lots of activities, like runs, walks, and hikes. Dudley is completely vaccinated, neutered, and microchipped. His adoption fee is $250. \n\nGo to our website https://redfernanimalrescue.org/ and FILL OUT AN APPLICATION if you are interested! Due to the amount of inquiries we are receiving, we are prioritizing adoption applications at this time. Make sure you\u2019re filling out an adoption application on Red Fern Animal Rescue\u2019s site in Colorado, as we are not a shelter in Tennessee!",

The family we got her from were not very nice to her and she is slow to trust, but once she does she will lick you to death. She loves playing and snuggling with her brother. She has been around children, other dogs and cats. She loves bones and treats. She like to be under the covers to sleep and having contact while sleeping. She is an amazing little pup just to energetic for my senior dogs. \n\nDiesel is an amazing lovable 10 month old chiweenie. He loves attention and loves being in contact with his human. He loves bones and fresh carrots. We are working on sit, stay, and fetch. The family we got him from was not very nice to him and we have shown him lots of love. He is doing alot better at going outside. He love snuggling with his sister. He has been around children, other dogs, and cats with no problems. He is just to active for my older dogs. \n\nApply here: https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/11077/generic",

            "description": "Say hello to Freckle! \n\nHe is a 2 year old Pit Bull mix who weighs about 50 pounds. He is a gregarious boy who loves to play and run off his energy when he gets excited. He is extremely playful and loves to play bow while he's playing with his toys. Freckle can't wait to find someone to play with, but if there are children in the home, they would need to be over the age of 13. Once he runs off his energy, he is an affectionate and loving dog who would make a great companion at home. Freckle gets along with most dogs with a good introduction.\n\nIf Freckle sounds like the pup you're looking for, give our adoption counselors a call at 234-212-9843 to schedule an appointment to meet him today!",

            "description": "Skarlet had an elderly owner who passed away. Her family could not care for her. She was very overweight and matted. We have her in a foster home where she has already lost ten pounds. Skarlett is eight years old and has some health issues. Our medical staff examined her and discovered she has Cushings disease. She had a dental cleaning and had lots of teeth pulled. She also has limited vision and cannot hear. \nDespite all of this, she is a friendly dog. She is not a lap dog but does like to sit next to her person. She is fine around other animals who do not pester her. Same with kids - if they are respectful with her, she is happy. She is kinda slow because of her weight and health issues. \nSkarlet is on twice daily tablets for the Cushings and twice daily eye drops for dry eye. The meds make her hungry all the time, but she is on weight maintenance food. She needs to be taken outside frequently - every two to three hours or she may go inside - not because she wants to. \nSkarlet will do best in a home where here person or people will be home most of the time. She's a real sweety!\nSkarlet is on our medical None Left Behind program and her medicine for Cushings disease will be covered by the League. To make an appointment to meet Skarlet, call the shelter at 513-735-2299.",

Before I was placed in a loving foster home, my former owner left me in the backyard all day long.  That was so darn boring and lonely.  I love people!  I love to be cuddled and walked and generally paid attention to\u2014I\u2019m trying to make up for all the time I spent alone in that backyard.\n\nBecause I\u2019ve got a lot of energy, it\u2019s important for me to find a home with a fenced-in yard.  I\u2019m pretty chill around cats, and I might get along with another dog as long as it\u2019s patient and can tolerate my high energy level.  Kids ages 8+ would probably get along just great with me!\n\nPlease consider me!  I promise that I will love you unconditionally for the rest of my life.\n\nIf you would like to adopt me, please reach out to Safe Paws Rescue and they will send you an application to begin the adoption process. Safe Paws is a small rescue, so they accept inquiries from residents in Pinellas County only, please.\n",

I am on the skinny side, which could be that I'm just old. I have some lumps and bumps that are consistent with a dog my age. My teeth are not a pretty sight, but please don't judge. No one took care of me. I like to talk like hound dogs do. Meet and greet required if you have another dog. Another senior dog would be recommended. Older children please. I appear housebroken. Call my adoption coordinator Alexandra 330-261-3934 if you can rescue me. My adoption donation is $100 and includes neuter, UTD vaccines, and microchip.",

I am a very sweet boy and an all around good dog! I would do best in a home without other dogs, cats, or small children - however teenagers would be fine. I am potty trained and know basic commands but would benefit from some continued training to make me the very best dog I can be! I am not destructive when left alone in the home. I would benefit from an experienced dog owner who knows how to help me thrive in a home setting. I would love to join a family that had a big backyard so that I could run around and play as I pleased. I am very visitor friendly and there's truly nothing that I enjoy more than cuddling up next to you on the couch for a good nap. I love to go for walks here on the ranch, but I am still working on learning how to walk on a leash properly, so please be patient with me.",

She doesn't seem very old so we think the reason she was released from the breeder circuit is her horribly infected and untreated PAWS! When we first got her in we thought her feet were matted... and yes, they are... BUT underneath the matting is infection and sores. Our theory is that she likely has allergies of some sort and has been licking her feet. Over time, the licking and build up of likely yeast... mixed with the hair on her paws... well, it just led to open sores... which led to infection, etc. She was sent to our vet today 12/21/2020 for addressing of her paws, spaying, vaccinations, heartworm/fecal testing, etc. She is very scared right now... understandably.\n\nNOT TAKING APPLICATIONS: We are not taking applications yet. We will post when s(he) is ready for adoption. In the interest of fairness, EARLY application submissions will NOT be considered. Please note we cannot respond to messages/emails, etc., on dogs that are NOT yet available for adoption. Please wait until the dog is available for adoption.

If you are waiting for a response, please understand that due to the volume of interest, replies may be delayed. Thank you for understanding! \n\nRemi is a 10 Month old, male German Shepherd/Husky mix.\n\nRemi was surrendered to our southern rescue partner due to divorce, and they did not have time for him any more. Remi is very timid when he first meets a new person.  He is great with other dogs and it really brings him out of his shell to be around other dogs, though he might be a little much for small dogs.  \nHe walks well on leash and is also completely house trained.   \n\nRemi needs a secure fenced yard if he is ever off leash, at least right now. He is easily startled and may bolt if a stranger tries to approach him if not in a secure fenced area when off leash.  He is also used to being in a crate. He is a very sweet dog, once he gets to know you and trust you, which doesn't take very long at all.  He is still a baby, and is easily trainable.  Remi is used to being around kids.  He hasn't been tested with cats.  He probably shouldn't live with cats, as most shepherds don't do well with them.  \n\n\nAdoption fees cover age specific vaccinations, spay/neuter, microchip, heartworm/lyme/ehrlichia test, worming and transport fees. \n\nAdoption fees: \nThrough 6 months of age $450; \n7 months to through 5 years $400; \n6 years and under 9 years $325: bonded pairs are $500; \n9 years and older $250: bonded pairs are $300 \n\nAlmost Home Rescue of New England is a 501 c 3 non-profit rescue; rescuing dogs since 2005. All Adoption applications are completed on line at www.almosthomerescue.net \n\nThis dog is available unless it is marked as Pending, meaning Pending Adoption. This dog is in foster care locally, ONLY if Maine or New Hampshire is listed next to the dogs name; otherwise, the dog is still waiting with our partner rescue for an adoption or foster home in New England. \n\nPLEASE NOTE - We will check your veterinary reference, to ensure that current and prior dogs have a history of being kept up to date on rabies and distemper, have had annual heartworm tests, and are on heartworm preventative at least 6 months of the year. Current pets must by spayed/neutered. \n\nImported dogs are transported on a USDA approved transport with a Health Certificate. All imported dogs are quarantined 14 days prior to getting on transport.\n\n",

Thank you!** \n\nMeet Mia - a 2 year old, 55 pound, Plott Hound mix gal.\n\nMia\u2019s fosters describe her as:\n\u201cThe best snuggler and kiss giver! She is goofy and so affectionate!\u201d\nCheck out her Instagram! @miagreatdogrescue\n\nMia is looking for a very special family! Mia is an active girl who loves to run and play fetch. She needs a quiet neighborhood to walk in and has been working on leash walking! Her new harness has helped a lot! Mia is a rough player with other dogs so we suggest she is the only dog in the home. She is not aggressive with other dogs so we think she will do fine with play dates - she just prefers to get all your attention. She also should not live with cats. She rides well in the car. She loves to bark to say hello! She gets so excited her entire butt wiggles!!! She is a lover and enjoys giving everyone kisses! She is great with little kids - very patient and affectionate with little ones and happy to run and play with bigger kids. She is housebroken but does not need her crate at all, knows \u2018sit\u2019 & \u2018wait\u2019 and that \u2018go nunnites\u2019 means to go to her dog bed in the bedroom to go to bed for the night. She will bark for a moment at guests when they come over but she stops once they can meet and people really love her. \n\nMia is epileptic and is on a few daily medications. She has an emergency med for the 24 hours after she has a seizure. She recently started a new medication that has helped decrease her seizures. She will need to see a vet every 6 months to take blood to make sure her blood levels are okay on her current meds. She already has a vet neurologist and will continue care with this vet after adoption.\n\nMia is going to require a patient owner who can deal with managing her energy and her epilepsy - but anyone who takes this on is going to feel the rewards of her love and affection for years to come!\n\nAll dogs are up to date on vaccinations and spayed/neutered at the time of adoption. All dogs require professional training to become the best family member they can be.\n\nTo adopt or learn more about Mia, you must fill out an adoption application. To find the application, copy and paste this URL into your browser: WWW.GDRNE.COM/ADOPTION-APPLICATION [Adoption Fee: $495]  **  PLEASE READ: If a dog is listed, then s/he is currently available for adoption. Their information is correct to the best of our abilities and the information we have been given as of the day of posting. Please note, GDRNE does not guarantee the breed of any dog or puppy unless stated that we have run DNA. All breeds listed are educated estimates. Our dogs are rescued from various situations. It is most likely that both their parents were strays and even if not, mixes of some sort and that their grandparents were mixes as well. The dog may have some genetic material of an American Staffordshire Terrier (pit bull). The dogs are usually mixes of many breeds, making them a breed all their own - a True and adorable American MUTT. If you are interested in this dog, you must submit an application. Great Dog is not a shelter so there is no building you can visit. Our dogs live in private foster homes until adopted. To learn more about our *shelterless* rescue, adoption fees, and procedures, review the list of Frequently Asked Questions on our website at WWW.GDRNE.COM.",

We will make every attempt to process all applications within 3 business days of receipt.\n\n// //\nMeet Dessy\n\n! Dressy is a three year old, 28 pound Shar-Pei Lab Mix. She is a fun and energetic dog. She loves to be the focus of attention, more importantly she has to be the only dog in the house. She loves going on walks outside and enjoys being in open areas. She does have separation anxiety, so she would do best in a home where someone is home most of the time. She is fully house trained and has been a great dog for her foster. She takes awhile to become comfortable with people, but after some time she becomes an affectionate dog. Dessy is spayed, micro chipped and current on her vaccines. Her adoption fee is $300.\n\nAll Second Chance Dog Rescue dogs are spayed/neutered, are up to date on vaccines and have microchips prior to adoption.\n\nAdoption fees vary depending on age of dog. Fees help Second Chance Dog Rescue cover spay/neuter costs,\n\nvaccinations, medical treatments,\n\nfood and supplies. Please go to\n\nwww.secondchancedogrescue.org\n\nand complete an application today!\n\nAll dogs live in private foster homes until they are adopted.",

Cowboy is nearly the perfect dog, being that he gets along well with other dogs and even cats. That\u2019s pretty impressive for a hound dog, don\u2019t cha think?\n\nCowboy\u2019s only preference is a home without children under the age of 12 years. This 3-year-old feller will also need someone committed to training him and teaching him basic manners. He is simply just the sweetest boy ever and deserves all the love in the world!\n\nGive us a ring at 804-991-3200 to set up a meet-and-greet with this easygoing guy ASAP!\n\nIf you have any questions about our adoptable pets, we can be reached by phone at 804-991-3200 or by email at pganimals@princegeorgecountyva.gov.\n\nBe sure to check out our Facebook and Instagram pages at Facebook.com/pganimals and Instagram.com/pganimals!",

Unfortunately his sister, who he was bonded to, was adopted without him before we could take them from the shelter together. Although we have plenty of friends for him to play with, he's sad. A quiet home with 1-2 small, 4 legged friends would be less overwhelming than our sometimes noisy rescue, and give him a chance to make friends one on one. He's a little cuddle bug and had the cutest bark... actually sounds like a sputtering car lol",

It is amazing what vet care can do for a mill mom. This girl is easygoing, sweet, and already housebroken. Tasha is happy to be living in a home instead of a barn. She is looking for her forever home.\n\n12/06/20\nTasha was released from the puppy mill because she has completed her job. She produced pups for many years, but now is no longer wanted. She is an incredibly gentle and loving girl.  Her ears were chewed by her mother when she was a puppy, so the farmer had his vet clip them down to match. He wanted to even them out so that she would show better when homes came to view her puppies for purchase. Tasha is cat and kid friendly, and wants a family that understands her worth. We happen to think whoever gets her will be the lucky ones! She is an absolute LOVE!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please fill out an online application first at www.adoptaboxerrescue.com.  Then e-mail the contacts below.  Be sure to include your full name, city, state, and area code in the subject line of your message. \n \nEmail the Boxer Rescue Contact Below:\nAdopt A Boxer Rescue\n\nDawn Karam - Gkaram18@aol.com\n",

            "description": "Disco has been in our care for just over a month and we are so proud of her progress. We would like to officially introduce this sweet girl as she is now available for adoption!\n\nDisco is estimated to be around 8 years old. She joined MMDR after she became increasingly stressed by the small children in her home. It was a very difficult decision for her family, but they felt it was in Disco\u2019s best interest to find a more suitable home for her. We enlisted the help of our trainer, Mydiek, to show Disco how to work through her anxiety when a stressful situation presented itself. Having Mydiek\u2019s professional expertise allowed us to really get to know Disco and determine what areas she needed help with the most so we can place her in the best fit home. Her foster family was sent home with lots of homework, and things have been going so well! \n\nWe are looking to place Disco in a home with no children. It was noted by her previous owners that she also didn\u2019t get along with other dogs. Though Disco does have leash reactivity, she has been in the same space as other dogs during her rehab without issue. She would prefer to be the only pet in her new home. Her new family will be required to have training sessions with Mydiek and Disco will be placed on a 3 week foster-to-adopt basis. This will allow Disco time to adjust and give her adopters time to work with Mydiek so they can apply her training at home. \n\nDisco is a wonderful dog that just got off to a rough start. We have quickly fallen in love with her squishy face! If you think Disco is a good fit for you, you can submit an application for adoption. If you have questions, or are already pre-approved please e-mail our adoptions team at misfitmuttsdogrescue@gmail.com \n\n**Please note that we adopt all dogs out on a best fit basis and not first come, first serve. There will be no exceptions to Disco\u2019s adoption guidelines. Please do not apply if you have children or other pets in the home**",

My family didn\u2019t come back for me. I was very sad and lived at the vet\u2019s office for over a month. Then the SPSPCA found me a foster family where I could play and heal emotionally.  \n\nAt my foster home I have many brothers and sisters to play with.  I absolutely love to play with them.  My foster mom says I have a happy go lucky temperament. During the day when the people are gone I stay in a crate.  The mom says I never have accidents in my crate. At night I sleep in my own bed on the floor of foster mom and dad\u2019s room. I am potty trained but I will need time to get used to a new place and your schedule. I am an excellent cuddler!  I love attention so much I tend to bite at your hands so you will pet me. I also try to use my paws to get your attention. I am learning not to do these things but for these reasons I would be best in a home with no children under 10.  If you are looking for a handsome cuddle buddy ask to meet me.  \n\nI am looking for a soulmate to love me forever. I never want to be left again.  I am neutered, current on all vaccinations, microchipped and heartworm negative. My adoption fee is $150. I can go on a home visit with you for 1 week! If you would like to meet Bam,  please email adoptions.spspca@gmail.com",

Inquiries don't reach us.\n\nIndigo, or Indi for short is located in NJ at the moment. He is a little over 1 year old. He\u2019s very loving and affectionate and full of energy. Indi is a neutered male, 36 pounds and overall, very healthy and up to date with his shots and vaccinations. He is housebroken and loves going on long hikes in the woods. When overstimulated, Indi does have the tendency to get mouthy and sometimes he may try to snap or bite. He can be picky about dogs he gets along with, but he seems to be very comfortable with dogs that are smaller than him. He is good on and off leash, but beware he does not like moving mountain bikes or joggers. If you like to run, jog, or hike he can be a great partner. \n\nEven though Indi loves to hike and run, he\u2019s also a great cuddle buddy too. He absolutely loves to snuggle and get neck and belly rubs. I work with dogs for a living and have been trying to get Indi adjusted to being around different kinds of dogs, but I\u2019ve been having a lot of difficulty with getting him comfortable with the larger dogs. So being in a household with multiple dogs will probably not be the best fit for him. Ideally, he should be in a home with no dogs, cats, or kids. He may be ok in a household with one smaller dog or equal size dog, I have a 28-pound ACD mix that he gets along with well. Also, a fenced in yard would be a plus though it isn\u2019t a requirement. He needs to be in a household with an owner that is very experienced with cattle dogs and is willing to work with him. Indi is a very sweet dog who has a lot of love to give if you\u2019re willing to let him warm up to you! \n\nFor questions, please contact adrukkerr@gmail.com/JBrock3@hotmail.com.\n\nCOMPLETE AN APPLICATION\nhttp://www.acdra.org/adoption-application\n\n\n\n",

Fill out an application here to get the ball rolling...\nhttps://pethavenmn.org/adopt/adoptable-dogs/dog-adoption-application/\n\nHere is more about Snider!\n\n6-years-old, 85-pounds\n\nHouse-trained: Yes \u2013 will likely need reminding of good habits as he learns his new environment\n\nCrate-trained: Yes \u2013 sleeps all night in his crate\n\nHealth: Snider is positive for Heartworm and the following is very important \u2013 he is on restricted exercise until the end of January for recovery purposes and overexertion can result in complications \u2013 he will need to be retested for heartworm in June 2021 to ensure they are cleared. This will be the adopter\u2019s responsibility. If still positive, adopter will need to work with their vet on treatment and he should receive Heartworm preventative for the rest of his life. \n\nOther Dogs: Unknown \u2013 because of his activity restrictions, he has not been socialized yet with other dogs, but he may be okay with one other dog in the home provided there is a very slow, controlled introduction and ample decompress time for both the dogs when in the new home\n\nCats: Cannot go to a home with a cat\n\nKids: Snider is very sweet and absolutely loves the kids in his foster home (ages 6 and 16)\n\nSnider is a sweet and gentle giant who has had a lot of change recently. He can be anxious and timid, but he makes such wonderful progress each day. Inside, where he feels most comfortable, he is an absolute joy. Calm and gentle when accepting treats, he will add so much love to a home. He is still afraid of cars and loud vehicles and will take off towards the back of the house when he is startled. It is important to have him on a strong leash at all times while outside. \n\nSnider loves his soft, squeaky chew toys and takes them into and out of his crate each day. He enjoys naps and relaxation most of the day since he is on restricted activity. Snider loves having a family and will thrive if there is a human to guide him and teach him confidence and happiness. He loves to be involved in all things relating to his humans. Having slow introductions and decompression time will be important to him and help him to enjoy his new forever environment. He is a true Great Pyrenees and training / acclimating to his new home will need to be in line with his breed. \n\n\nHis adoption fee includes spay/neuter, heartworm/Lyme test, all age-appropriate vaccinations (distemper, rabies, & Bordetella), HW and flea/tick preventative, and microchip implant and registration. \n\nThere is no guarantee of age and breed as a rescue animal's history is unknown. All ages and breeds are best guess.\n\nAdoption fees INCLUDE a mandatory sales tax of 7.525%.\n\nDue to post-adoption services provided, it is Pet Haven's policy to only place dogs into homes within a 75-mile radius of the Minneapolis, MN city center.\n\n",

Baby Rose is an absolute sweetheart, however, she is still quite spunky and slipped through the gate before, so a fenced yard us preferred.  \n\nAt 8 years old, this petite, healthy young lady is full of life and active, too.  She is currently in a foster home doing well with the two resident dogs, however, when she is walked on a leash she has a tendency to lunge at other dogs.  We are hoping to find Baby Rose a loving family she can finally call her own permanently! \n\nBaby Rose\u2019s adoption fee is $300 which includes her spay, microchip, fecal exam, and shots up to date. \n\nPlease consider opening your heart and loving home to this affectionate angel!\n\nAs we are a rescue all of our adult dogs/puppies for adoption must be spayed or neutered. Although we make every attempt to have this done before finding their adoptive families, this is not always possible. Please speak with your adoption coordinator to see of this service has already been performed or they will explain to you if your new dog/puppy will need this service while in your care at no cost to you.\n\nWhen emailing please include your phone number to help speed up the adoption process.   Also, for the safety of our dogs we only adopt within a 2 hour radius of Joliet, Illinois to allow our volunteers to do home checks if necessary.",

The old owner cooked a special meal for him in large amounts and we have the recipe as she thought it helped with the issue he was diagnosed with 4 years ago. Glomerulonephritis is a kidney related disease and with  a special diet he has regulated himself and is not taking any meds, but we are using the cooked food as welll as other normal dog food.  He would make a wonderful companion dog and perfect for someone with time for him to be cherished again.  We adore him and will require applications.  He spent his life with children and truly is a gentle soul.  He loves when he sees a leash coming his way so prepare to get some exercise with him!!",

He overcomes that in time (food always helps!).  If you are interested in this 3 year old boy, please go to our website \"odas.org\" and fill out the preliminary under the Adopt column.

            "description": "Tux (and his doggie brother Baloo) came to MPR when their owner, who loved them very very very much, passed away leaving a grieving family trying to do right by his dogs. Tux is 6 years old and has had 2 ACL surgeries.  They should not require any further care - but this owner loved these dogs enough to properly vet them.  \n\nTux is not a fan of cats, does GREAT with older kids but kids have to be ok with a dog of his size and one that is an active bully breed.  He could easily knock over younger kids.  \n\nWe have not done a lot of dog testing yet.  He's a big guy, needs to lose about 20 pounds, and we're working on that actively now with lots of walks and low calorie food/treats.   \n\nTux has not spent much time on a leash as the old home had a doggie door and access at his leisure to a fenced back yard.  As such for Tux to be successful we are looking for a home or homes with a fenced in yard.  Also just due to his size a fenced yard is his best option.  \n\nThey love belly rubs, sleeping in a comfy human bed or couch (Tux was a spoiled fur baby!), and laying around. He is neutered and up-to-date on shots/vet checks. \n\nPlease complete an adoption application at www.moshpitrescue.com and we will reply promptly to see if your home is a good fit for Tux!!!  \n\nThe dogs came in together but we are looking for separate homes for them.  Tux is a lot of dog - he's 6 going on 2 and active.  Baloo (his doggie brother) is 6 going on 16 and would prefer not to be alone...  \n\nFrom the daughter: Tux was adopted from his previous owner at only 4 months old, when the young owner realized he didn\u2019t have time for a dog. Tux was originally purchased from a Pit breeder in Chicago.\u00a0He\u2019s smart, sensitive and loving. He\u2019ll sit at your feet at the table, and would prefer your lap on the couch. He also likes to sleep in bed with his person! He\u2019s a bit protective of his person - he\u2019s prefer to get the belly rubs himself instead of letting his dog brother get them, so if you give too much attention to someone else, expect Tux to wiggle his way in between you and the recipient of your attention. He loves belly rubs and plays tug of war (he\u2019s strong and playful!). He has had two ACL surgeries and is completely up-to-date on all his vet needs. All of his vet records will come with him. Tux has not been regularly handled on a leash, but the few times he\u2019s been on one (to the vet and back), he has handled it well. He does love to go for car rides...in fact, when he escapes from the house, the easiest way to catch him is to offer him a ride in the car - he\u2019ll jump right in! He\u2019s somewhat lazy but does get exercise in his fenced in yard. He has had one dog brother his whole life. He is probably not a good fit for smaller animals - especially rabbits and cats.",

He is very sweet once he trusts you but does need time to warm up. Once he loves you he will do everything in his power to be where you are. He should be kenneled or behind a closed door if you are leaving as he is super fast and WILL manage to get past you if you are not very aware of where he is. And if he thinks you are about to leave him he doesn't mind a game of keep away. He is leash trained and doing well with house breaking but will need supervision and reminders. He has a naughty habit of trying to keep you from leaving by grabbing your feet. He is pretty mouthy. But we are working on that. He is NOT aggressive just mouthy and was probably very spoiled.",

She just wants to run and explore everything and then jump in your arms for a minute of cuddles and kissing before dashing off to her next adventure. Born in 2014, Ginger would be best in a no-cat home. \n\n?  Year of Birth 2014\n\n   ?  Loves walks and hikes. Anywhere she can run off leash is awesome!\n\n    ?  Pet peeve is sitting still.\n   \n   ?  Loves people and attention. Will try to climb in laps.\n\n?  Bright and happy, easily distracted. \n\n    ?  Focuses on cats, squirrels in an obsessive manner when passing. Basenji\u2019s are \n           African hunting dogs and Ginger shows this characteristic.\n\n?  Would be a great family dog, but may jump on very young children.\n\n    ?  Smart and does learn quickly with treat rewards.\n\n     ?  Puppy energy and gusto even at 6 years old. \n\n    ?  Loves to ride in cars.  \n\n\n \n\n\n",

She is crate trained and house trained when kept on a set schedule. She loves to play play play and would love another dog her size to romp around the required fenced in yard. She does need to continue working on her house manners as she jumps on the counters and explores the trash if left unsupervised.\n\nShe is dog savvy older kid friendly as her 70lbs of puppiness would be too much for young kids and small dogs. She walks well on leash, but gets excited to meet new people and dogs, we suggest a harness while walking. She can be very vocal so no apartments or condos. She is an active wiggle butt and would love to be with an active family, she is go go go, until it is time for bed, then she goes nicely in her crate.\n\nIf interested, please\ncomplete the\nAdoption Application\non our website at\nwww.NeedyPaws.org\nand we will contact you.\nAdopters must live within an hour's drive of St. Louis, MO.\n\nOur $250 adoption fee includes up-to-date vaccinations, heartworm testing and preventative, spay/neuter and microchip.\n\nWe are a 100% foster-based rescue and all of our dogs live in approved foster homes. We are dedicated to finding the best Forever Homes, and will perform home visits and conduct veterinarian and reference checks for each potential adopter.",

            "description": "A couple of months ago, we pulled a senior \"Border Collie\" from a local shelter. Roxy is around 10 years old, but has lots of spring in her step still. She does have bad hips and is not a candidate for surgery, so she will do best on glucosamine supplements and Metacam. Her new owners will need to be aligned on this for her moving forward.\nShe will do best as the only pet and with no small children. She is a finicky old lady, and loves her people, but her world should be kept small. Her DNA results show that she is not a Border Collie at all, but in fact, a Heinz 57! If you think you have room in your home and heart for this special gal, send us a private message. She is fully vetted and up to date on all her vaccinations. She will make a wonderful companion for a quiet household. \n\nRoxy weighs 44 lbs. She is not for a home with lots of stairs and would do best in a dog savvy home. \n\nRoxy is located in Hamilton, ON.",

Though she may be cautious to start, give her your generous heart along with a tasty treat, and in return you'll get the sweetest, gentlest soul.\n\n   ?  Can be reactive, bark or snap at strangers, because she was raised with no \n          socialization. Training can overcome this because Poppy\u2019s smart and likes treats.\n   \n   ?  Poppy\u2019s afraid of barking dogs in the kennels and doesn\u2019t like walking by them. \n\n  ?  Was surrendered to the Shelter soon after having a litter of puppies and seems   \n          depressed.\n\n?  Enjoys being petted and sitting near her person.\n\n    ?  Seems interested in cats, but not necessarily obsessed. \n\n?  Would be best for an adult only family because of her sensitivity to strangers \n        and sudden movement. \n\n    ?  Likes walks but is also happy to lay in the sun and work on her tan. \n\n     ?  Responds well to verbal reassurance. \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

He is around 1-2 and enjoys playing with other dogs. He would do best in a one story home with a fenced in yard. This boy deserves to be spoiled like crazy for the rest of his life!",

PLEASE READ\n\nPosted animals are physically located at the above address except when indicated with the following notations after the animal's name:\n\nAnimal Name (FC=initials) -- indicates the animal is living in Foster Care. To meet the animal, please contact the foster directly when contact information is provided; otherwise call the shelter at 434 263-7722.\n\nAnimal Name (COURTESY) - this animal is posted as a public courtesy using information provided by the owner.

Also, adoption does not involve our shelter but is strictly between the adopter and the owner.\n\nCUTE LITTLE GUY WITH HAPPY SOULUPDATE 12/21/20:\nRooster and his brother Roger recently arrived as strays. Rooster appears to be a Beagle that is @4 years old and weighs 30.4 pounds. He is a very cute little guy with a happy little soul. When vetted and neutered, he tested positive for Heartworm (only) on his 4-way test for Heartworm, Lyme, Ehrlichia, and Anaplasmosis.\nRooster can be adopted before he completes his Heartworm treatment but his new owner must be willing to take him to Lovingston Vet for his appointments and keep him crated and leash walked only until April. He is a very affectionate little guy-he appreciates love with all of his heart!\nHe is being fostered by Fonda and if you are interested in him please contact her at rockfishkayaker@aol.com so she can tell you more about him.\nNOTE: All animals are spayed/neutered as soon as practical after arriving at our facility unless there is a medical issue that may cause a delay or they are too young to be spayed/neutered.

PLEASE READ\n\nPosted animals are physically located at the above address except when indicated with the following notations after the animal's name:\n\nAnimal Name (FC=initials) -- indicates the animal is living in Foster Care. To meet the animal, please contact the foster directly when contact information is provided; otherwise call the shelter at 434 263-7722.\n\nAnimal Name (COURTESY) - this animal is posted as a public courtesy using information provided by the owner. Our shelter does not own or guarantee the information provided by the owner to be complete and accurate. Also, adoption does not involve our shelter but is strictly between the adopter and the owner.\n\nVERY CUTE LITTLE GUY!!!UPDATE 12/21/20:\nRoger and his brother Rooster recently arrived as strays. Roger appears to be a Beagle that is @2 years old and weighs 30 pounds. He is a very cute little guy with a happy little soul. When vetted and neutered, he tested positive for Heartworm (only) on his 4-way test for Heartworm, Lyme, Ehrlichia, and Anaplasmosis.\nRoger can be adopted before he completes his Heartworm treatment but his new owner must be willing to take him to Lovingston Vet for his appointments and keep him crated and leash walked only until April.\nHe is being fostered by Fonda and if you are interested in him please contact her at rockfishkayaker@aol.com so she can tell you more about him.\n\nNOTE: All animals are spayed/neutered as soon as practical after arriving at our facility unless there is a medical issue that may cause a delay or they are too young to be spayed/neutered.VOLUNTEERS and DONATIONS NEEDED.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Clay County Animal Rescue & Shelter is located at 14400 Hwy. 45 in Louisville, IL. Our phone number is 618-665-3005. The shelter is open to the public 1-3 Monday-Saturday. Sundays we are open 1-4 to the public. If those times don't work, please call to set up a time to visit.\n\nThe typical adoption fee for dogs is $150. It includes vaccination, deworming , spay/neuter, heartworm testing on dogs of age and microchipping, which is now mandatory by state law. Some dogs we discount to as little as $50 due to sponsorship. Some dogs we ask a higher adoption fee, which helps us recoup expenses on heartworm treatment on other dogs.\n\nAll cats are spayed/neutered/vaccinated/flea treated/dewormed and microchipped prior to adoption. Cat adoption fees range from $60-$100. We spay/neuter/microchip/vaccinate and deworm all kittens and cats, prior to adoption. Our shyer/less adoptable cats are classed as \"barn cats\" and are free with a completed/approved barn cat application, which can be found on our website.\n\nFor updates on adoption events and more pics of pets available, go to our website, www.claycountyshelter.com or look for us on Facebook.",

He loves toys and pouncing around while he plays. We brought Angus to the League from another shelter, so we do not know much about his background. He is socialized and confident, so he must have had a home in his past. Angus will be too much for a home with small children. He has tons of potential and will do best with a confident owner who will provide leadership and direction. This big boy with a constant smile on his face just needs to learn some manners.

My favorite hobbies are playing with toys, getting pets and eating treats! I was picked up as a stray, I am so glad because that way of life was not a good fit for me. I prefer a life of luxury with soft blankets and comfy furniture! I follow my foster mom around everywhere so I would be a great companion for someone looking for a best friend. I love to curl up next to my human on the couch. One of my favorite things to do is play with my foster sister in the backyard. She can be kind of mean and bossy to me but it is no big deal! I do need an adult-only home because I don't like being pushed or pulled by my collar unless I trust you and know you won't hurt me. This is the only quirk I have and I promise I am the best boy you will ever meet!.\n\nPotty trained and Crate trained. I am good in my crate while my foster mom is at work for 8-9 hours.\nPeople and dog friendly!\nGreat on a leash for walks\nMedium Energy level\nAdult-Only home. No Apartments/Condos\nAbout 35 lbs.\nCats: unknown\nNeeds: Basic obedience training, I am a puppy and can't help but jump when excited\nFenced yard preferred (4' chain link is fine)\n\nIf interested, please\ncomplete the\nAdoption Application\non our website at\nwww.NeedyPaws.org\nand we will contact you.\nAdopters must live within an hour's drive of St. Louis, MO.\n\nOur $250 adoption fee includes up-to-date vaccinations, heartworm testing and preventative, spay/neuter and microchip.\n\nWe are a 100% foster-based rescue and all of our dogs live in approved foster homes. We are dedicated to finding the best Forever Homes, and will perform home visits and conduct veterinarian and reference checks for each potential adopter.",

            "description": "Jack came from his one and only home along with Stella - he is 3 years young and about 35 pounds. He has been neuter, given his shots, and his rabies vaccine. He is ready for his forever home which needs to have another young/energetic/playful beagle in it.\n*Note: Jack would do well in a home with someone young and strong that loves to go hiking, walking, and playing fetch. Someone who can work with Jack's energy and young adult dog strength.\nPlease find our applications and valuable information under 'Adopt a dog'* on our website: *www.beaglesandbuddies.com* and email your application to beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Let us know your preference of appointment day/time and which dogs you are interested in and we will do our best to accommodate and email you the closest appointment available. Please allow us up to a week to get back to you. Most appointments will be Friday-Sunday, 10 am - 2 pm, for an hour.\n*Note bring any other dog/s and the entire family to your meet and greet at B&B.* A complimentary training manual is included with each adoption, authored by terristeuben.com. Check out her website - she is fabulous!\nB&B is glad to be open during the pandemic. We know the value and comfort of a loving pet companion and are doing our best to help the dogs and folks who need them. We update our website daily and are always rescuing, vetting, rehabilitating, socializing.\n* We are accepting applications for volunteers to spend time with our dogs, hang out, sing/read to the shy ones, walk/toss ball with those who go to the playgrounds; cleaning, office work, gardening, and building/repair projects! *\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment. Please look at our website and make a list of one or more dogs that you would like to see.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf you have a question about adopting, giving up a dog, boarding, or volunteering, please visit the appropriate tabs on our\nhome page.\n\nFor more specific questions, call 626-444-9664 (please leave a voicemail if no answer) or email at beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Note that\nEmailing\nis always preferred!\n\nThanks!\n\nPlease note: If you are viewing this profile anywhere other than Beagles & Buddies own website, you are not receiving full info.

This 3 year old was terrified and snappy when she was surrendered to a crowded county shelter and took a few days in foster care to let us touch her, but once she bonds she\u2019s a silly playful fun-loving girl.  She was overweight but doing well on her diet and exercise program and already getting around better.  She has luxating patellas in her back legs as is common in small dogs and the extra weight was putting more strain on her knees, so it\u2019s extra important to keep the weight off of her.  \nSusie is looking for a calmer adult-only home without a lot of people coming and going where she can feel safe.  She gets along with some dogs as long as they give her space at first and is even starting to play with them sometimes.  \n\nPlease email njwoof@cs.com for an appointment to meet her \n\nDue to COVID-19, we will not be holding our Sunday adoption events until further notice, but we can schedule socially distant appointments with a specific dog outdoors at our vet\u2019s office:\nVCA Morris Plains Animal Hospital \n3009 Rt 10 East \nMorris Plains (Denville on GPS) NJ 07950\nNow is the perfect time to open your home to a needy dog!  Submit an application from our website www.secondchance.petfinder.com to speed up the adoption process\nAll our dogs reside in foster care in Northern NJ until adoption. We are a small all-volunteer organization focused on rescuing local dogs from area shelters, as well as accepting some surrenders and puppy mill rescues. \n",

Athena is a quiet and gentle soul who enjoys walks and resting in her crate. \n\nAthena is dog friendly - but definitely knows she is the queen and is dominant and will play on her terms only. \n\nWhile she has not formally lived with any cats, she appears to take a keen interest in them and may do better in a home without them. \n\nIf interested in adopting Athena, please send us an inquiry or complete an adoption application at our website: www.gulfcoaststars.com\n\n*Athena would prefer a home without other animals or small children.*",

He is currently in foster care with a staff member who he loves, but he is still skeptical of her husband even after a month. Dude loves the other dog in the home and welcomes other foster cogs big and small easily.\nDude is now potty trained and sleeps well through the night on the couch with his foster sister, he does insist on all the affection when his foster mom comes home from work and gets super silly.",

She is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4512700.\n\nGlitter is a very scared girl that doesn't know why she is at the shelter. She is terrified of the staff that is working with her and she just wants to stay and hide in her kennel. She doesn't like the leash and when she's in the play yard, she just wants to sit in the corner and try to hide. A very positive sign was Glitter interacting with another shy female dog in the play yard. She may do well with another calm dog that will help her to see that everything is okay. She will need a calm home and an adopter or rescue that is experienced with very scared dogs. She cannot go to a home with children. She will need a lot of time, love and patience.\n\nIf you think you can help Glitter, please come and meet her today! Please bring your calm and quiet dog with you to meet her too if you already have a dog at home.\n\nTo visit with this pup, please make an appointment here: https://mcaccappointments.as.me/adopt. NOTE: People who sign up for these appointments often no-show, and we have seen that you can generally show up and let them know you are there to meet this particular dog and the shelter will squeeze you in, except from 12-3PM or closer to the 6PM closing time. (Please know this is not a guarantee). If the dog is at risk, please ask for a supervisor to meet that particular dog.\n\n*Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG. MCACC is located at 2500 S. 27th Avenue, Phoenix. Different adoption fees/policy may apply. Please visit MCACC's website http://www.maricopa.gov/pets/locations.aspx for hours. You may also wish to call 602-506-7387 (PETS) and provide the animal's A# above to verify is still available.",

Buckshot is a very friendly and sweet boy!  You can tell he is eager to learn and please.  He will have to go to a home without kids, this is mandatory.  We are not sure how he is with other dogs and cats as he has never been exposed to either of them.  All Buckshot needs is time, patience and consistency in training to become a wonderful house dog.

I am pushy, stubborn, energetic and anxious, loveable, velcro-dog, fun, active, focused, playful, willing to please. \n\nDon't let my age describe my energy level as I am still on the go and want to play. However do let my age describe my abilities such as potty trained. \n\nI love squeaky toys. For Christmas, I have asked for a bin FULL of toys. I carry them around in my mouth all the time. This is so much fun! If you are going to kennel me, I will protest. I will bark and bark if you kennel me - so no apartment living for me. I prefer a house with my own fenced yard where I can be queen and you can throw the ball for me. I don't want to share my toys with other dogs and I will let them know - remember, I told you I am queen. If other dogs are going to leave me alone and let me do my thing, then I can live with that. I am not about to live with cats though - nope, no thanks, not my thing. I am looking for a family for the rest of my life that will be willing to keep up with me and do fun things as well as go home and eventually relax, enjoying the comforts of a plush couch and/or bed. \n\nAge: Estimated DOB 3/6/12\nGender: Female, spayed\nBreed(s): German Shorthair Pointer\nWeight: \nDog friendly: Doesn\u2019t want to share toys; \"please don\u2019t be in my face\"\nCat friendly: no\nAdoption fee: $250 plus tax",

He's also a mad cuddler with his humans during afternoon power naps. Prancer is a bit of a play biter so we recommend a home without little kiddos. Prancer will do well in a variety of homes. He's not quite house trained (he tends to mark a bit), but he'd hard at work trying to break that habit. Prancer is approx 18 lbs. He's in foster in Denver. Adoption fee is $400.

While she does great with other dogs, she gets over stimulated with multiple dogs. With that in mind, she needs a home with either one other dog or by herself. By no means is she a dog that has aggression issues at all and she loves absolutely everyone. Applications can be completed online from our webpage at causeforpaws.net Inquiries will be forwarded to her foster mom.\n\nHope and her mom, Joy came into rescue after living their lives on a chain 24/7 Joy the mom, is heartworm positive and not yet ready for adoption. Hope will be available in the next week or so after her spay. Hope is said to be a Boxer/Bulldog mix and is medium in size weighing under 40 lbs. Hope has settled into her foster home and does well with her foster siblings but loves to play. Most of the dogs in foster home do not appreciate her energy as they are senior, small dogs. Hope loves everyone she meets and will require a home with a commitment to attend training classes. You cannot help but fall in love with this super little girl.\nHope will go to her forever home with her collar/leash, bed, toys, which she loves and probably has never had before, food to acclimate and her bowls. \nFor more information on Hope please email causeforpawsrescue@gmail.com \nApplications can be completed online from our webpage at causeforpaws.net\nAdoption radius is 100 miles\nAdoption fee $300",

According to the previous owner, she is not yet house trained, good with kids and dogs but can be food aggressive at times. She hasn't been around cats. If you would like to meet her, please call the shelter to schedule an appointment. ***Our adoption process is done in two steps . Your first trip to the shelter will include visiting with the animal and if you choose to do an adoption, all the paperwork will be completed at this time and the adoption will be paid for. The second trip will be to pick the animal up once it is spayed or neutered, micro chipped etc and ready to go home. All of our animals are spayed/neutered BEFORE they leave the shelter.  Because of our strict return policy if an adopter cannot keep an adopted pet, adoptions to homes more than 100 miles away will be considered on a case by case basis.",

            "description": "Fanny is a dainty sweetie with puppy-dog eyes that will warm your heart! She over three years old and weighs around 40 lbs. Fanny would do best in a home that is patient with older or no children. She loves to sleep and follow you around, but she is nervous of sudden movements. It's likely she hasn't spent much time before SG as a house pet. She wouldn't mind a small canine companion and is fine with cats, ignoring them. Fanny does great on walks, she takes her time and sniffs the grass, and enjoys the breeze. She likes car rides and is quiet and calm. Give her a little time and she'll give you her heart! She will be a fabulous addition to a family that can provide patience, love, and lots of belly rubs.\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

I would do best in a home where the family has time to train me and understand me! I promise to be a good boy! I am neutered, up-to-date on vaccines and microchipped.

The owner reported that he lived in an apartment, and Jay would get out and go after other dogs. We have not seen that at all at the shelter. Jay seems very sweet towards people. Jay also knows how to sit on command. It would be best if Jay was an only pet in the household. He will make a great family member for a family that is looking for a big, lovable, goofy boy! Meet this loving, handsome, 5 year old boy in run 56. His ID number is 626544. Jay a 67 pound boy that is up-to-date on vaccines and neutered, so he will be microchipped and heartworm tested upon adoption. Jay can't wait to start loving his new family!\n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information. Shelter hours are: Tues. - Sun. 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. by appointment only until further notice, CLOSED Mondays & Holidays.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Hi -\n\nMy name is Zeke and I am here on the website through no fault of my own. My parents were retired and moving to a retirement community when they learned at the last minute that the community had rules against having large dogs. They had to reluctantly give me up - it was a sad day for all of us.\n\nNow I am with my new foster family settling in quite nicely. My foster dad tells me that I am very smart and routinely practices my basic commands. When he takes me for walks, I rarely tug on the leash and practice good dog-manners. When I see other dogs, I am curious and say hi but continue on our path. I enjoy going to places with my foster family and like riding in the car.\n\nYou may notice in my pictures that my front paws turn outwards. I was just made that way and while unusual for GSD, it is common in some of my dog cousins like bulldogs. You can see in the video how much I love to play fetch and that it doesn't impede my ability to run and play.\n\nI am very food and toy motivated and love to learn new commands and routines. It doesn't take me more than 3 or 4 times to learn new things. I know how important it is to be housebroken.\n\nHopeful that I have won your heart over and you are open to adding me to your pack! Please email my foster parents if you have questions! 12/21/20 11:13 AM",

She has a black patch over one eye which makes her looks cute and mysterious. She's great with other dogs, seems housebroken and very sweet. When introduced to cats she didn't seem interested. She came as stray with her sister, Mitzi and after weeks of waiting no one ever came to claim them. She loves her sister but they are not required to be adopted together. Though two is always better than one. She rides well in the car and is good on a leash.\n\nTo see Darcy by APPOINTMENT ONLY, submit an online dog adoption application at http://hsfc.org/adoptions/applications/online/. An adoption counselor will contact you--typically within three business days--to discuss with you the type of dog you are looking for and to see whether we have a good match for you. Our counselor will discuss the next steps afterward.",

I have not had the opportunity to be a fulltime house dog but I would love to have the chance.

He loves his crate but doesn't need to be crated. He likes to hide his food in his favorite bowl so he knows where it is for later. AND he knows basic commands! He's good with people but due to his size (and he loves the zoomies) we feel a home with no small children would be best for him. Due to his background he can be cautious with strangers but with proper introductions, he warms up quickly and LOVES TO BE LOVED. He's lived in a home with cats and was fine with them. As with humans, he would thrive best if proper introductions with other dogs is made. A dog running up and getting in his face will put him on the defensive.

She sleeps most of the day away, occasionally waking to go outside.  Her bitty back legs are a bit weak so sometime she walks a little sideways.  She doesn\u2019t seem to mind, but it makes stairs impossible.  Don\u2019t fret, she has also earned the right to be carried to where she needs to go.  Lady likes to quietly observe those around her from her comfy cozy bed and leave the interacting to the young ones, but she won\u2019t mind if you give her lots of pets and scratches.  She is mostly house trained, but sometimes\u2026you gotta go when you gotta go!  No worries, she is completely fine wearing some bottoms, if you know what I mean ;).  Her cute little eyes aren\u2019t as sharp as they used to be.  Bright lights and strong cold wind aren\u2019t her favorite.  She is patiently awaiting her Doggle\u2019s order to see if that helps!\n\nShe would love a forever home that will treat her like princess she is.  She\u2019s earned it!",

Is current on shots, neutered, microchipped, and heartworm negative. Interested: complete and submit the Dog adoption application available on this page. HOME visit and FENCED in yard required. NO electric fences, and no exceptions to our fenced-in-yard requirement. ADOPTION fee and contract apply. Available for out-of-state adoption, adopter covers the cost of transportation. \n\nOur adoption process involves 3 steps. We only accept two applications per dog/animal. We evaluate both applicants before deciding which household is the best fit. If only one application is received we evaluate this application using the standard process.\n\nFirst, we evaluate you on paper via the adoption application https://www.123formbuilder.com/form-5081187/. Or the form provided after his presentation on Petstablished. com. If you meet our requirements we schedule a home visit, we travel up to 1.5 hours from our location. On this occasion, we bring the dog(s) with us to your home. The purpose of this visit is to meet you face to face, and for you to meet the dog(s), as well as for us to evaluate your fenced in yard and if there are other dogs in the home to evaluate the dog to dog interaction. There is no compromise on your part to adopt and neither is there a compromise on our part to adopt the dog(s) out to you. If we determine that you are the best candidate for their adoption and you are interested in proceeding with the adoption we complete the adoption contract, collect the adoption donation, and provide you with his Veterinary records. We will not adopt out any of our dogs to a household where there is no fenced-in-yard (it does not have to be big, just fenced in) or where electric fences are in use.",

Please make sure to read his full bio to ensure that he is a good match for you. \n\nMeet Kona! a 6-year-old, 10 lb miniature Poodle blend boy. We all know that Kona is adorable but please read his full bio. He will need a very special adopter who will be patient and understand him. Kona is nippy and only wants small doses of affection on HIS timeline. He cant be approached or he will nip. If he walks up to you and jumps up or starts licking you, then he wants affection and will graciously accept pets. But when hes done hes done. Hes also very possessive of his space. Dont approach him while hes in bed or he will snap. This includes dogs getting too close to him as well - for this reason, Kona needs to be the only dog in the home. Because of this, Kona can not be adopted to a home with children. He drags shoes and clothes to his bedding area but doesnt chew on themtheyre like a security blanket for him. Hes not a fan of the crate so his foster family lets him stay out in their house when they leave. He LOVES being outside, he wanders every corner of the yard and looks for lizards, and is tough to get back inside sometime! Kona will need an adopter with a fully secure fenced in yard. Although he does love to take walks.\n\nHe is going to need a special adopter who knows they arent getting a cuddly lap dog. Kona has already been adopted and returned once. He really needs to find that special person(s) that will accept him for who he is and love him unconditionally forever. Kona is up to date on his vaccines, heartworm negative, neutered, and microchipped. His adoption donation is $300. If you think that you could be the angel that Kona is looking for and would like to learn more about him from his foster family, please visit our website www.PoodleandPoochRescue.org where you will find the application to adopt.",

But she would much rather play with you!! Rink is quite fearful of men, especially those whom she has never met or those visiting the house. Her ideal home would be a low traffic household (not many visitors) and with a single female, female couple, or a female & male couple but the male must understand he will need to earn her trust and go slow!! Rink is a dog that may need to be put away when guests are over.\n\nRink is very high energy but she is so loving, obedient and eager to please. She is great in the car and good with other dogs, too. She is okay with children, although she should be homed with older kids who have dog experience as she can get easily startled. She knows how to \"Sit\" and \"Give paw\" & is a great size!\n\nIf you think this good-natured pup could be \"the one\" for you & your family, please fill out an application & be sure to ask for RINK BECK!",

As a senior, she was dumped in a shelter, in such bad shape that we didn't even know what color her fur would be. After a few months of love and care for her body and soul in a foster home, Rosie is flourishing! She is about 10-11 years old and she is a Shepherd mix. She is sweet and absolutely loves to snuggle on a couch or bed with her humans. She can get a bit protective over food when other dogs are around, but she is just fine with them if food is out of the equation. Rosie is incontinent and will need a patient family. She will reward you with love and absolute adoration. \n\nThe adoption fee of $200 will include spay/neuter, microchip, age appropriate/required vaccinations, treatment for heartworm and any other necessary medical treatment to assure a healthy new pup for your family.\n\n\nIMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: Although we do our best to describe breed, since our pups all come from shelters we can not and will not make any guarantee on breed or size. We can tell you that they are 100% RESCUED!

He was found wandering the streets and when picked up by Animal Control with  a leg wound wrapped in electrical tape. \nCoco is vision impaired but that doesn't hold him back! Within a day of living with his foster family he could easily navigate around the house. He found the water bowl, jumped on and off the couch, and most importantly discovered his foster dad is a pushover when it comes to handing out treats!\nCoco loves to wander around the fence in the yard and to follow other dogs, he loves to follow his human around too.  While he has not exactly learned to play with squeaky toys he loves to hear them and his tail goes crazy with joy.  \nCoco is a sweet, easy going little guy who loves everyone. He especially loves being with his person. He is quiet. I've yet to hear him bark. He is neutered and completely vetted. Coco does his jobs when taken outside. He does not let you know when he needs to go out so wears a belly band when inside. This special little guy is looking for a special forever home. Please call Mary Palmer at 262 800 3323. \nYou can find our application on our website Http://malteserescue.homestead.com\n\n\n",

He had a zero chance of making it out of a rural shelter without a rescue's help. \nRight now, he knows one command..''house''.  When we call him he will try to avoid people but runs in the house or runs into his crate. We are not a fan of feeding in crates, but its the only way we can be assured he is eating enough on schedule.\nAt night when its time for bed, he will run in the bedroom with the other dogs and sleeps all night.  He will stay still once cornered to be picked up, but that is as far as we have got with him.\nWould anyone like to work with Georgie, even for 2 weeks at their home? We are hoping that we can find a few people that would be willing to help Georgie become more socialized around people.  Short term, long term, whatever someone would be willing to offer this boy to help him become more comfortable around people.  He is VERY submissive. LOVES OTHER DOGS. This boy needs a lots of time, patience and compassion.\nPaws Rescue 727-772-3935\n*As always, Paws provides everything for our foster pups.",

Ralphie is around 2 years old and will need some help working on his leash manners, so a home with a fenced in yard would be ideal for him at this time. He will need a family that is willing to do some training with him. This sweet boy loves attention and affection and is happy to lean in to his human friends for some pets! So far he has made friends with a female pup at the shelter, and would need to meet any pets in a potential home, but he does seem happy to make canine friends.  He also met the resident shelter cat and was friendly with him, so we think he would be okay with living with a kitty friend.",

He's being crate trained and doing well. He needs a lot of exercise and mental stimulation. He's really turning a corner and will make a wonderful puppy for his new forever home!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this pet please complete an application at this link https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/24689/generic . \n\nWe are an official 501C3 organziation that does not have a physical location.

If a dog receives multiple applications, we operate on a best-fit basis, not first come first served.***\n\n**Charlie Brown is looking for a forever home where he has at least one dog friend, a fenced in yard or a dog park close by, and a family that is around a lot**\n\nHi, my name is Charlie Brown and I am a 2ish year old hound mix that is as sweet as I am goofy. I love love love other dogs and people are pretty awesome, too. I have not been around cats, but my foster mom thinks I'd probably be fine with them since I'm a bit of a scaredy boy. \n\nI am a playful boy with lots of energy. I need an active home that will ensure I get lots of exercise and attention! I am potty trained and crate trained, but I cannot yet be trusted left out of the crate when no one is home because I have a bit of separation anxiety. I have been known to break out of a wire crate, so foster mom uses zip ties to keep me in! I do much better in the crate when I have another dog next to me or close by! \n\nThough I have lots of energy, I am also more than happy to take a nice long nap on a dog bed or on the couch where my human can pet me! Belly rubs are great, and so are snuggles. I also enjoy running around and playing with toys in the backyard. I am still learning what toys are meant for me and what \"\"toys\"\" belong to my humans. I am getting better, but for the time being you should put your shoes away where I can't reach them! \n\nI am currently taking fluoxetine (it's very cheap :p) to help with my separation anxiety, but foster mom says I've come a long way and that in the right forever home she doubts I'll need to stay on it longterm.\n\nI am neutered, up-to-date on vaccinations, microchipped, have been dewormed, and am current on my flea/tick and heartworm preventatives. My adoption fee is $300. If you think I could be the one for you, please fill out an adoption application on our website. If you have any questions about me, please email the Dog Program Manager at laura@secondchancenc.org. Thank you!",

He needs an experienced adoptor that can help build confidence. He was found as a stray, I'm quite sure poor guy had been mistreated, he is not for first time dog owner. No kids or other animals, we want to set him up for success. His foster family taught him alot and he is very quick to bond, very affectionate! No cats, he is not a fan.

His name is Hugo and he is the sweetest and cutest old guy. He makes the most adorable happy squeals, and is a total joy to be around.\n\nHugo is 8 years old and is partially blind. He would do best in a home with small dogs or as an only dog. He is house trained, loves people and has a positive outlook on life. He was surrendered to a California shelter, and has won the hearts of those who have gotten to know him, so we just know there is a lucky adopter out there for this special guy. \n\nWe are partnering with Big Bones Canine Rescue to find Hugo a loving forever home. If you are interested in adopting or fostering Hugo, please email us at woof@olddogsnewdigs.com. And if not please help Hugo and share this post. Thanks!!!\n\nPLEASE NOTE - We will check your veterinary reference, to ensure that current and prior pets have a history of being kept up to date on vaccines, annual exams and recommended bloodwork. We also do home checks to make sure that your home environment meets the needs of the particular dog you are interested in.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adoption, please fill out our online adoption survey at https://www.olddogsnewdigs.com/adoption-survey/\n\n",

I'm a total love bug, and I've never met a person I don't like, but I'm choosy about my canine friends and would do best in a home where I can have my pawrents all to myself. My favorite place to be is next to my humans keeping them company.\n\nI love to go for walks and walk well on leash, but I can get pupset when walking past other dogs. I just need to learn that it's okay and that I have nothing to worry about. My other hobbies include sleeping in sunny spots, sniffing in the backyard, watching you cook, going for car rides, and being adorable. I don't even mind going to the vet! I don't really like to be left alone at home for long periods of time because I start to worry about my people. Can you blame me? I basically think humans are the very best! I would love to find my very own forever family to adore. Do you think that could be you?\n\nFOSTER to ADOPT an option ..\n\nTo learn more about me and better yet, to arrange to meet me, please fill out this application: www.tinyurl.com/AdoptMeNow\n\nWoof!\n1/31/21 8:01 PM",

She is a small girl at 25lbs and won\u2019t get much bigger then that. She is up to date on her vaccines and is microchipped. She also gets monthly heart worm and flea and tick prevention. Mazey is a very special little girl - she\u2019s also deaf! But she does not know the difference and she does not let it slow her down. \n\nMazey is a sassy little girl that will need an experienced family (and a fenced yard with a physical fence) to really shine in a new home. She is smart as a whip and a sweet little firecracker! Once she is a little older she will make someone a great sport dog and hiking partner. She has started single jump work and started agility foundation for puppies. This girl is excelling beyond our hopes and watching her work through a problem is amazing. She absolutely loves training and would make a great demo dog for someone. She has great toy drive and food drive for training, and as is typical for heelers, needs a problem to solve. \n\nMazey loves other dogs to play rough and tumble with her! She gets along really well with other dogs but sadly, no cats or small animals and because of her deafness (and typical cattle dog puppy nippiness!) needs a home with only adults or teenaged or older children. She is 90% potty trained and she is working on loose leash walking. She is getting better every day with this but does get excited when she sees people and she loves them! She hasn\u2019t met a person she doesn\u2019t like.\n\nAre you ready to add a smart and sassy girl to your home? Please apply at www.sohodogrescue.org!",

She's good with most dogs but will chase kitties so a cat free home is best. Pepper is a bit of an escape artist so needs a secure 5 ft fence.\n\nPlease email us at AlmostHome4Dogs@yahoo.com to find out if Pepper is the right one for you! (Local adoptions preferred - Philadelphia and tri-state area [South Jersey and northern Delaware] only.)\n\nPLEASE READ BEFORE CONTACTING US!\nWe are NOT a shelter: All of our dogs live in private homes with foster families. Come and meet the Almost Home dogs and their fosters at our Meet & Greet events, where you can learn more about our wonderful dogs from the people who live with them, find out which dogs are on their way and when they'll arrive, and fill out an application to adopt or foster.\n\nWe cannot adopt to homes where electric-shock fencing systems or training collars are used. For more information on the dangers of electric-shock collars, please visit banshockcollars.ca/studies.php and http://www.hollysden.com/say_no_to_shock.htm (scroll down and click on the \"Invisible Fencing Systems\" link).\n\nWe do not have an online adoption application; to request an application, e-mail us at AlmostHome4Dogs@yahoo.com. To speed e-mail processing time, be sure to note the name of the dog you are inquiring about in the Subject line. For Meet & Greet times and locations, visit our home page, where you also will find information on our adoption process and fees.\n\nFOSTER FAMILIES ARE LIFESAVERS!! Can you open your heart and home for a few weeks to homeless shelter dog? Remember, by fostering a dog, you save TWO lives - that of your foster dog, and that of the dog who takes his place in the shelter! Come to a Meet & Greet and find out if fostering is for you - there's no reward quite like the feeling that you've saved a life ... or two!",

For those he knows and loves, he rolls on his back for belly rubs. Sadly, he is also a fear-biter.\n\nThat\u2019s why Manny has been waiting at the Famous Fido shelter for six and a half years. He has potential if only the right, dog-loving patient person willing and able to manage his behavior would come forward.\n\nManny is healthy, neutered, up-to-date on vaccines, heartworm-tested and microchipped. \n\nHis adoption fee of $250 benefits the Famous Fido Rescue.\n\nTo meet and possibly adopt Manny, please fill out the application for adoption at https://famousfidorescue.org/dog-adoption-application/\n\nYou can follow up on your application by e-mailing Tina at tinasells@yahoo.com to set up an appointment to meet him. \n\nHe is currently at the Famous Fido Shelter at 3124 W.

            "description": "Hi! I'm Bourbon. \nAbout 6 months and Deaf. \nI am a pittie pup. \nThe last time my foster mom weighed me I weighed in at around 25lbs. \n\nI've been working really hard on potty training. I occasionally still have an accident or two, but I'm getting better. I know how to sit and what settle down means thanks to my foster mom's sign language she came up with. I absolutely LOVE playing with toys. I can go for hours. I will get the zoomies and become a little tornado. I enjoy sleeping next to my foster brother all night long.  I go in the crate when no one is going to be home, I whine a lot but eventually fall asleep. \n\nI would do best in a home with a large yard, big enough for my zoomies. I get along better with dogs my age and size. I would prefer to go to a home with children 12+ or older. Younger children scare me. I am very curious about cats, but with my high energy I would probably not be an ideal friend for them. \n\nI am located in Columbus, Ohio and I am so ready to go to my furever home. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please review our adoption policies and apply online at [www.speakfortheunspoken.com/adopt](http://www.speakfortheunspoken.com/adopt).\n\nVisit [www.speakfortheunspoken.com](http://www.speakfortheunspoken.com/) will give you more information about our rescue.\n\n***PLEASE READ*** WE DO NOT RESPOND TO PETFINDER OR EMAIL INQUIRIES. Please fill out an application on our website if you are interested in adopting this dog. We will only set up a meeting with the dog once you have an approved adoption application. We actively manage our dogs on Petfinder, the dogs listed are available for adoption. We will remove the dog from view once they are pending adoption.",

He is also playful with other dogs. Once he came out of his shell a little his tail didn't really stop wagging. Titus is a large boy but he is highly trainable according to his foster mom and very treat motivated. She says he is now potty trained and doing excellent with his leash walking and is also doing super well with crate-training. Titus is great with children but due to his size he would probably do best with children 10 and older as he could accidentally knock down little ones. Titus requests a home with a large couch for napping and snuggling but that is all!  If interested in meeting this handsome guy please ask us today.\nTitus was super lucky and scored a wonderful foster home! He is now decompressing from shelter living and learning a whole bunch of new tricks as well as how to dog. \nFor more information, please contact Kristianna (a volunteer with Jxn Friends of the Animal Shelter) via phone (410-924-1053) or email (ksaelensybk2@yahoo.com). Titus has already been neutered by Jackson Friends of the Animal Shelter.  For more pictures and information, please take a look at our Jackson Friends of the Animal Shelter page on Facebook.",

He knows basic commands, he is house trained, and crate trained (although he does fine without a crate, too). Despite being middle aged, he has quite a bit of energy. He loves to be silly, romp around his yard, and play with his toys!\n\nDuke's unique personality and strong intelligence will make him a great companion for his future forever home!  He is looking for a home that contains older children or adults only, where he will be the only pet. Duke also requires a physical fenced-in yard - but he is worth it!\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about Duke, or if you'd like to inquire about scheduling a meet & greet with this sweet boy, please contact us at A Place for Paws Animal Rescue - Duke cannot wait to meet you!!",

Because he is blind we don't feel he'd be a good fit for small children. Though he has never been at all snappy, it is easy to startle him. He needs a safe home with a good routine and a little patience as we're still working on house training...he wears a belly band in the house and we think his recent neuter will help. He does now know what \"go outside\" means and he's great about going out our dog door to go potty. \n\nRadar was never given much in life and then he was abandoned in the country...a blind dog left to fend for himself. He deserves nothing but the best from now on and we intend to make sure that happens.\n\nIf you are interested in seeing if Radar might be a good fit for your home, please go to \"more about us\" where you'll find a link to our online application.

His previous owners didn't bother to feed him right up until the day they dumped him off at the shelter, not caring what would happen to him. Little did he know that was his lucky day!  Zeus has been doing great in his foster home. He has since put on some weight and has learned how much fun he can have playing with toys.  Balls are definitely his favorite!  Our boy loves people and  would do best with older kids as he is a \"bouncing boxer\".   In his foster home, after some further evaluation he loves all of the dogs, especially when they play tug of war with him!  Zeus is around 2 years old and 48 lbs, and has some more weight to gain.  He is crate trained but still learning the ins and outs of being a house dog and does have an occasional accident. Our sweet Zeus is now ready to find his forever home where he will be a cherished part of the family and never be hungry again.

All I know is that I get to hang out with a family that has boy humans and pups I play with all day long. We play chase, tug-a-war, take walks, go on car adventures and more. When we are all tuckered out, I like to snuggle up to my humans and keep them warm. Occasionally I go in a crate when my humans are not home. I don't mind especially when they give me a chew toy with peanut butter. It's my most favorite cuz I know there is a yummy treat for me deep inside. Sometimes I get impatient and excited but it's only because am so eager to love love love love love love and play. I have been working on my manners and my foster mom and dad give me lots of love when I listen to their commands like sit, stay, wait, free, heel. I don't mind learning new tricks, the young boy in my home taught me how to shake and then I get a treat. When I think about my forever family, I think about, fun car rides, running, playing and eating yummy food. I would like to sit and watch TV with you. Cuddle with you. I also like belly rubs. My foster mom gives the best rubs. I do like to meet others in a slow and easy way just so I don't get too enthusiastic. My foster family say I am going to be an amazing dog for the perfect family. I can't wait to meet them.\n\nIf you believe Duke would be a great fit with your family, apply today at:\n\nhttps://www.nwboxerrescue.org/adoption-form\n\nIf you would like to adopt him, fill out an adoption application on our website www.nwboxerrescue.org\n\nLike us on facebook for more photos of this handsome boy, as well as other boxers we have available! www.facebook.com/northwestboxerrescue",

I LOVE belly rubs and am super attached to people. I'll follow you step for step and sit between your feet waiting for pets. I wasn't cared for very well before I came to the shelter so I've got some arthritis that makes me run and jump a little funny but I still get it done!\n\nThis dog is spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccinations and current on flea/tick and heartworm preventative. This dog has tested negative for heartworms and is being treated in our care. The adoption fee is $400 if your adoption is prepaid and final prior to your dog's arrival. An additional $50 will be charged on dogs that are picked up from our Southbury CT adoption center, adopted at an event or foster home in order to comply with CT HB 5368.\n\nIf you are a MA resident, your new family member is required to go through a mandatory 48 hour quarantine period at the Woburn, MA isolation facility.  Your new family member will be dropped off by our transport on Thursday and will be ready for you to pick him/her up on Saturday between 12pm-2pm.  An additional $100 fee will be added for any dogs picked up from the Woburn, MA quarantine facility in order to comply with MA Order 405-CD-12 and Order 1-AHO-05.  \n\nTO APPLY PLEASE GO TO  www.cprdogs.com.  If your application was successfully submitted you will get a confirmation.  \n\nAfter receipt of your application an adoption counselor will then be in touch to answer your questions about this pup, discuss the adoption process and get the ball rolling!  If you have not heard from one of our volunteers within 5 days of submitting your application, please email mollibo@gmail.com.",

            "description": "Spot is a big boy who knows how to sit, fetch and take treats quite nicely. He's close to six years old so no crazy puppy energy. \n\nSpot needs a home with a lot of experience handling large dogs. No first timers. He needs a home willing to put the time in to training him and providing appropriate exercise. \n\nSpot can be cautious in new situations and needs time to get comfortable, but it doesn't take him long. \n\nSpot is great in the car and loves rides. He is gentle with people, but loves to run and play. After play time, we feel he's a couch potato at heart. \n\nThough he would have to be the only pet in a home, he would be very loyal to his family. \n*****************************************************************************************************\nInterested in adopting?\n\nDue to COVID- 19 the shelter is closed to the public at this time.\n\nWe are still conducting adoptions, but with a few changes. :)\n\n1. Submit an application through our website at wacshelter.com if you are interested in giving one of our shelter animals a home\n\n2. We will schedule phone interviews once the online application has been processed.\n\n3. If the animal applied for is determined to be a good fit for the home, we will schedule a controlled in person meeting with the cat or dog prior to the adoption.\n\n*ADOPTION FEE:\n\n$95 (cash only) and includes:\n\nSpay/neuter\nFirst vaccines\nFIV/FeLV test (cats)\nHeartworm test (dogs)\nRabies vaccine (if old enough).\n\n*****************************************************************************************************\nAdditional questions?\n\nDoes this dog get along with cats? There is almost always an acclimation period when a new pet joins the household. We are happy to suggest a few ways to ease the transition. A new dog should never be left alone with resident pets though.\n\nDoes this dog respond well to other dogs? No dog loves every other dog. A proper introduction (meet and greet) would be required as part of the application process.\n\nIs this dog good with children? The better question is how the children have been taught to handle animals. A dog will respond negatively if he/she is not being handled properly. We can offer suggestions on how to teach children to interact with dogs and pay attention to body language. Young children should never be left unsupervised with new animals.\n\n*****************************************************************************************************\nWant to help a real shelter animal by adopting a Mini Plush Pet from our limited time fundraiser?

            "description": "Taz ACCT-A-78805\nIntake: Stray\nSex: Male\nAge: 5 Years\nAltered: No\n\nHi there! My name is Taz! I'm 5 years young and neutered. I'm about 29 lbs and believed to be a puggle mix--though we can't be too sure since I was found as a stray. I was pretty nervous while at the shelter and stressed while getting kenneled which led me to having to a couple bite incidents. My volunteer and staff friends saw through my fear though, which led me to foster care where I've been my very best self. I'm very food motivated (hot dogs are my favorite!) and I've been told that I'm a fast learner. I've mastered \"sit\" \"come,\" \"look,\" and \"in\" (for when it's time for me to head to my room). I'm working on other commands like \"off\" and \"leave it\" for when I jump up for attention or try to taste a yummy street treat. ;)\n\nI've been living with my 2 large foster siblings that are male and female pit bull mixes and it's been a blast! I love being around other dogs and enjoy play wrestling with my foster siblings. Some of my favorite pastimes include playing ball (I even bring it back to you), chewing on nylabones, and enjoying stuffed animals with squeakers in them. My foster parent says I'm like their little shadow that follows them around the house. I also love naps and being a lapdog. When it's time to go for a walk I get super excited and hop around like a bunny. I'm still working on not pulling as much on the leash.\n\nI'd prefer a home that is patient and willing to go slow with me. Adult humans are my favorite. Tiny humans make me nervous. I'm a huge fan of positive reinforcement training and promise to be my very best self for humans that come prepared with hot dogs and yummy treats. I'd also really enjoy a home with another dog. Any size is cool with me--as long as they enjoy having a 29 lbs dude like me around. If you think we might be a good match reach out to my foster parent Rachel via email at rachellawbaugh@gmail.com\n\nVideos:\nTaz Takes Treats: https://youtu.be/8wqidPNdv0w\nhttps://youtu.be/YWEF__RlysU\nhttps://youtu.be/yueI9JCUSrE\n\nDog Meets:\nTaz and Doug: https://youtu.be/IMLrb3UowEo\nTaz and Doug 2: https://youtu.be/aijqDpr6IuU\n\nBite Details: \n(12/10) -- His slip lead had come loose, so Lifesaving staff member got a treat in her left hand to distract Taz while she went to readjust the lead with her right hand. She can't remember if Taz took the treat or not, but he bit her right hand and latched. Level 3B.\n(11/09)-- Bit Animal Care Attendant last night while attempting to get Taz back into kennel. Bite was to finger, level 3.\n\nMedical Observation:\n(11/06) fully vaccinated and checked in\n\nBehavioral Observation:\n1/4 (per Foster) -- Day One in foster: \nFor transport he walked into a crate nicely that I loaded into my car. Once at my place he got out of the crate and car with ease. I have him set up in a spare bedroom to decompress and have some space to himself. He knows sit and loves hot dogs. He pulls on walks, but it's manageable since he's small. He's not neutered yet and loves to mark on each post and tree. I have a pee pad set up in the corner of the room that he's already been using to pee.\nDay Two in foster: \nHe slept the whole night through in his room without a peep. Continues to pee just on the pee pads while inside. Does majority of his business outside during our walks. Ate all of his kibble for breakfast and dinner. He's heard and seen my dogs through the doorway and only had tail wags and loose body language. I spend time in the room with him throughout the day while working from home and doing a puzzle off work hours. He'll do some whining when I leave the room but he settles within minutes. I have toys out for him to occupy himself. He's enjoys stuffies and nyla bones. He'll rotate between laying in his crate and laying on a bed outside of the crate.\nI haven't attempted to handle him much or even pet him. I'm continuing to respect his space and mindful of the issues reported about him while in the shelter. Honestly, he's surprised me with his best behavior so far.\nDay 3-6 in Foster:\nTaz continues to warm up in foster care. He's settled nicely into a routine and goes to the door when he's ready for walks. He no longer pulls as much on the leash. He's had loose body language and appears relaxed when seeing dogs and people from afar. His favorite activity is being 'kitchen supervisor.' He'll sit and watch as my roommate and I cook. When we eat he puts his puppy eyes to work while sitting nicely. When excited he'll hop around like a bunny. He's solicited pets and even rolls over for belly rubs. We've been cautious of handling him due to his prior sensitivities, but he's continued to ask for pets by leaning into us and using his head to nudge our hands. He's been relaxed, loose, and shown no concerning behaviors during any handling. He trades toys nicely and likes to carry his stuffies proudly.\nDay 7-14 in foster:\nTaz has continued to do well in foster care. He's allowed all handling and enjoying pets. He now asks for head massages and belly rubs regularly. He tolerated a bath with some peanut butter encouragement and really enjoyed the towel dry afterwards. I took him to get neutered at ACCT and he sat in the back nicely while tethered. I was able to place Taz in the surgery kennel with no issue and remove him after the surgery with ease. Vet staff said he was a very good boy. Taz continues to sleep through the night in his own room, takes treats nicely, and do well being left alone while rotating time being out between my resident dogs. I've started walk alongs individually with each of my resident dogs. Taz has been loose, friendly, and polite during walks. \n12/13 (Per Staff) --Taz participated in today's photoshoot. When I went to his kennel, he allowed me to leash him, and pulled to get outside. He'd gone a walk with a KA earlier. He was uninterested in pets and was given to a volunteer (blue) handler who was familiar with him and his issues. He was very motivated by hot dog treats. He took several treats from the hand. He participated in the photoshoot, and then was returned to kennel. While returning him to his kennel, hot dog treats were tossed on the ground which resulted in him allowing for his collar to be removed and the loop to be loosened so it could easily be removed in kennel. Once in the kennel, he jumped in and more hot dog treats were dropped. He ate them too quickly for the leash to be removed. Dropped more hot dog toward the front of the kennel, which allowed for leash to be quickly removed. Once removed he had already finished the hot dog treats and as door was shut, he jumped up hard barking and snarling. \n12/13 (Per Staff) -- Kennel Presentation: Hard barking. Hard barking on approach but loosens when leash is presented. Takes treats greedily and is able to be leashed. Returning to kennel, switched to temp lead. Taz enters kennel without issue but then turns and starts snapping as leash as kennel door is closed. Did not attempt to remove leash.\nLeash Skills: Pulls Moderately On Leash\nHandleability: Aggressive/Unable to handle. Unable to fully handle due to behavior. Tolerates slow pets to rear with tense body but whale eyed and growling for any other attempted handling.\nTag: Did not attempt\nToys: No interest. No interest in rope toy or ball.\nColor Level: Blue\n11/30 (Per Staff) -- Easily removed from kennel, walked fast put did not pull through kennels. Sniffed around office. No interest in treats or toys. Solicited attention. Allowed handling. When stopped petting, jumped up asking for more. Easily walked back through kennels, but once returned to kennel started hard barking and showing teeth. \n11/19 (Per Staff) -- NRO, off BQ\n11/13 (Per Staff) -- Taz participated in the photoshoot today. He was easy to leash in his cage and walked out without any issue. He appears very housetrained as he pooped only a few minutes after walking out of the kennel. He was nervous in the room, and he growled at the photographer when he reached forward with a treat. He walked up the dog ramp after hesitating at first. I had my hand near his rear and he growled when I moved it but was easily redirected by a treat and squeaky toy. After several photos he walked down the ramp and back to his cage. Right before we got to the cage he peed a lot, and did not want to go back in, and immediately tried to snap at the leash once he was in the cage and snap at the door, so I left the slip leash on him. \n11/06 (Per Vet) -- Fractious, QAR\n11/06 (Per Finder) -- fearful, unsocialized to people, can be aggressive and try to bite if you attempt to pet him, pulls a lot on leash \n\n\nThis animal is currently available from foster care through ACCT Philly's Adoptions Programs.

            "description": "Bella is a sweet, 4 1/2 yo terrier mix, who is currently on 2 medications to control her seizures. She is not seizure free - and she has days full of spunk, and days where she is a little slower. She currently lives in a foster home with another dog, 2 cats, and a teenager. A quiet home, with older teenagers or adults would be ideal, as she has some mobility issues, and can be sometimes unsteady on her feet. She prefers if the animals and people give her space, and understand her personal boundaries. She will seek pets and wants to play on her own terms, but is not a 'cuddly' dog. She does sometimes chase her foster canine brother around the yard, but can get unbalanced at times. She does walk stiffly but does ok with stairs and when getting up from laying down. Bella will have an accident in the house if not taken out regularly, but her kennel is dry and clean every morning. She is food motivated, and does know sit. She can be sensitive to touch when trying to dry her off on a rainy day. \n\nBella is looking for the special home to give her much love and patience, with all her quirks and unique health considerations. She will back as much in return. If interested in Bella, apply at: AHeinz57.com\n\n\nAHeinz57 Pet Rescue and Transport is a 501c3 no-kill animal rescue located in De Soto, Iowa.

Lilo was born without front legs. He gets along just fine. His foster mom got him some wheels and he is learning to get around with them too.  He requires no special care.  He is just different.\n\nLilo is a sweet boy. He loves attention!  He is a cuddle bug and enjoys a good belly rub.  He loves being outside on pretty days.  He is great with other dogs of all sizes. He is good with children school age and above.  He is fine with cats as well.  Lilo does like to protect his bowl of food from the other dogs. He will grumble if they come near him while he's eating but it never comes to anything.  Lilo is a typical Chi.  He has some \"stranger danger\" anxiety with new people. With a little time and TLC he warms up and is loyal little companion.     \n\nLilo is fully vetted, up to date on vaccines, is neutered and microchipped. He is on Proheart 6 and Bravecto.\n\nLilo's adoption fee is $175. The adoption fee helps with costs associated with getting our pets healthy and ready for forever homes.",

WE ARE A NO-KILL 501-C-3 NON-PROFIT RESCUE: To see an animal, you must fill out an application first and then once approved, we can set up for you to meet the animal you are interested in.\n\nHere is the Dog Application that you can copy and paste into a browser: https://fs17.formsite.com/waverlypetrescue/form028182466/index.html\n\nClifford was from an accidental litter in Kelsey, Iowa. Mom is spayed now and Clifford is a WPR dog. He is living in a foster home. He is now up to date on shots, dewormed, treated with Frontlline, and tested heartworm negative. He will be getting neutered in February and can be adopted after he is fixed. Apply now to adopt him and we will hold him for you until he is ready.\n\nClifford is 6-months old as of December 2020. Right now he weighs 50 pounds and still has some growing to do. His mom is a purebred Boxer and his dad is a black lab. Clifford is a sweet pup and very friendly. He has a lot of puppy energy. He is working on manners and getting housetrained in his foster home. He does well with children and other dogs. He has not been around cats.\n\nWill someone please adopt Clifford and give him a forever home? $350.00 adoption fee.\n\nWE ARE A NO-KILL 501-C-3 NON-PROFIT RESCUE. All donations are tax deductible. We do not have a shelter. All pets live in foster homes. We only adopt to indoor homes. To see an animal, you must fill out an application first and then once approved, we can set up for you to meet the animal you are interested in. We do background checks on all applicants. If you have assault, domestic abuse, or drug charges please do not apply. If you have questions, please send an email to waverlypetrescue@mchsi.com\n\nAll animals see a vet for shots and normal exams. If they appear healthy and there are no obvious health concerns, then extensive testing is not done. This is normal procedure for pet rescues and shelters.\nWaverly Pet Rescue puts a lot of money into medical care for each dog and cat we take in. $350 is the average cost for basic care. This does not include if the animal had an injury, required extra flea / ear mite treatments, or needed extra days at the vet office.",

            "description": "Jackson is a Staffordshire bull terrier, black with a little white on his chest. He is 7 years old and 30-35 lbs. He is house and leash trained. However, we always say that our dogs need a refresher course when they join your forever home. He'd like an adult home- or with dog-savvy teens- where he's the only pet, and where's he active. He likes having a job; for example, he likes helping our disabled volunteer. He is obedient and knows commands like 'sit'.\nHe was in a home with a couple since he was a puppy. They gave him up because they had slowed down, but he hadn't! He still has a lot of energy. He was used to being an only dog, and would prefer that in his new home. They did take him to doggie day care, where he was fine with the dogs.\nHis family said that he had started getting territorial about their bedroom, and so we recommend that he sleep in another room of the house, and not go in the bedroom.\nHe's one of those dogs that just always has to carry his ball! Another favorite toy is his Bob's Big Boy figure.\nGot his very nice young adult Dad, who has wanted a dog just like him for a long time. Came from San Jose to meet 'n greet and drive home with him. Sadly, Jackson came back to us because the Mom of the house became afraid of him; he nipped at her. If it had been anyone else in the home, folks would have worked through it. His young Dad is heartbroken. We'll be having consult with animal communicator to learn more.\nPlease find our applications and valuable information under 'Adopt a dog'* on our website: *www.beaglesandbuddies.com* and email your application to beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Let us know your preference of appointment day/time and which dogs you are interested in and we will do our best to accommodate and email you the closest appointment available. Please allow us up to a week to get back to you. Most appointments will be Friday-Sunday, 10 am - 2 pm, for an hour.\n*Note bring any other dog/s and the entire family to your meet and greet at B&B.* A complimentary training manual is included with each adoption, authored by terristeuben.com. Check out her website - she is fabulous!\nB&B is glad to be open during the pandemic. We know the value and comfort of a loving pet companion and are doing our best to help the dogs and folks who need them. We update our website daily and are always rescuing, vetting, rehabilitating, socializing.\n* We are accepting applications for volunteers to spend time with our dogs, hang out, sing/read to the shy ones, walk/toss ball with those who go to the playgrounds; cleaning, office work, gardening, and building/repair projects! *\n\n\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment. Please look at our website and make a list of one or more dogs that you would like to see.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf you have a question about adopting, giving up a dog, boarding, or volunteering, please visit the appropriate tabs on our\nhome page.\n\nFor more specific questions, call 626-444-9664 (please leave a voicemail if no answer) or email at beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Note that\nEmailing\nis always preferred!\n\nThanks!\n\nPlease note: If you are viewing this profile anywhere other than Beagles & Buddies own website, you are not receiving full info.

He is such a sweet boy and does great on a leash. He has done very well on pack walks and doesn\u2019t respond to reactive/grouchy dogs. He may do better with larger dogs due to his size. He has done well with a young child and is very gentle. This guy is just a big lug who really wants to find a family for the holidays and deserves to be comfy and cozy. \n\nAGE\n4 years\n\nHOUSE-TRAINED\nWorking on it!\n\nGOOD IN A HOME WITH\nGood w/ kiddos. Good with dogs but SLOW introduction and boundaries recommended.\n",

OUR CONTACT IS THROUGH FACEBOOK MESSENGER. https://www.facebook.com/REDRescueEveryDog/\n\nMeet Twiggy! This darling girl is average pug size (estimated weight 22lbs in November 2020) and estimated to be 6 to 8 years old. This sweet girl came to RED 12.19.2020 after time in a foster home. She was a last chance for life dog out of Texas, so not much is known about her past, however we do know she had a rough life as breeder dog until she was no longer useful. When she was found, she was diagnosed with heartworm. She has since been treated, tested clear, and is now on preventatives. Additionally she has an enlongaged pallet (common in the breed) that causes her to cough if she exerts herself or there is pressure on it (she needs to walk in a harness). That combined with her being a flat faced dog means she needs to be in cooler temperatures and cannot go everywhere with you. Her caseworker can go more in depth on the vets notes regarding this issue. While in foster care she has shown to be incredibly kind and happy, she bunks with a shy Chi and gets along with everyone. This dog requires a fully fenced yard with a visible fence, as well as a small designated area (set up like a Precision Courtyard Kennel) for when she is left unattended.  We are looking for someone who is home often with pug or flat faced dog experience who will be loyal and treat her like the special pup she is. Adoption donation is $450.\n\nTHIS DOG IS IN FOSTER CARE IN POULSBO, WA. MEET AND GREETS WILL TAKE PLACE THERE AS WELL. \n\nREQUIREMENTS FOR ADOPTION:\n\n- Securely and visibly fenced yard \n- Precision Courtyard Kennel \n- Pug or flat faced dog experience\n- Preference to a home with a dog friend\n\n\n\nADOPTION PROCESS: \n\nIf you are interested in adoption please fill out an application here: http://www.rescueeverydog.org/Adoption.php\nAnswers to the application MUST be sent via message on Facebook (we do not receive applications sent via email)\n\n1.

            "description": "Hey there you. My name is Sabine, but my nickname is Bean. I am a very big, playful energetic puppy that is looking for a strong adopter who will not allow me to push my boundaries. For my first several months of life, I lived in a home with a mom and older human siblings. Because of that, I am a little hesitant of men, but my foster family is working with me on that. I am also working on my manners and leash training as I got too big too fast for my last family. I am house and crate trained, spayed, vaccinated, microchipped and on monthly heartworm prevention. I need a home that will be assertive but patient as I continue to learn how to be a member of the family. I also need a home with no kitties or small dogs since I really have no clue quite how big I am. My adoption fee is $350 in the greater Houston area ($650 out of state includes adoption fee, transportation, and health certificate). You can apply at www.soca-fbc.org/adoptables.

            "description": "The NMDR Rehab Team is working with Ace to help him work through some behavior challenges. He needs a family who will be extra patient with him, and who preferably has experience with large dogs. The NMDR Behavior Manager will talk to prospective adopters to explain the work we've done with him, and what will be the best home situation for him. To submit an application to adopt Ace, visit https://nmdr.org/our-dogs/adopt/\n\nFun Facts about Ace\nVery friendly with people\nLikes other dogs \nEnjoys sunshine and fresh air\nBig goofy, happy guy\n\nChallenges for Ace\nCan be wild and jumpy, and sometimes play bites\nNeeds an adopter experienced with large dogs\nNeeds a lot of exercise\nHis family will have no kids younger than 16 years\n\n-----\nPrior to being rescued, many of our dogs have experienced minimal socialization. As a result, there is often an adjustment period when learning about life as a family pet. We typically do not adopt to homes with children under 6 years old; homes with older children will be considered on an individual basis. Common skills such as house training and leash walking will often take a little extra time. Patience, understanding and a gentle hand are a must. The great news is, most of these dogs come around rather quickly and being a part of their rehabilitation is an extremely rewarding experience.

She came to us as an abandoned dog left in a rental...family moved and left her there for days, poor baby; so she really enjoys being around her people, playing with other dogs and her toys, she's a very active girl...still has a lot of puppy in her! lol  \n\nShe can be a little shy when meeting people but warms up quickly.  She has a tendency to \"wiggle\" when she gets excited, she'll wag her tail so fast she sometimes hits herself in the face! lol  It's funny, she's just full of joy, happy to see her foster family when they get home! :)  She's good with dogs too, she enjoys the companionship, will play and snuggle with them, so if have a playful, high energy dog that needs a companion to play with, she's your girl! \n\nSassy is a good girl, she's house trained, will sit for a treat and will kennel up if needed.  She's spayed, microchipped, current on her shots and heart worm tested, so she's healthy and ready to meet her new family! :)    \n\nIf you're interested in meeting Sassy girl, please visit our website at, www.doggonerescue.com, to fill out our adoption application, that'll get the ball rolling! If you should have any questions don't hesitate to let us know, we look forward to hearing from you!",

            "description": "Fiona is in a foster home in Kent WA\n\n***Please DO NOT send us inquiries/emails asking if this dog is still available. If a dog/puppy is still listed on Petfinder- we are still accepting applications for them***\n\nHi there! Let's get the medical notes out of the way first and see if you still think Fiona would be a good fit :)\n\nFiona was in a foster-to-adopt home recently & they took her to see a vet and we discovered that she has a heart murmur. We do not know the severity at this time, but will be getting xrays to determine if she will require medication or not. Many dogs live long, healthy lives with heart murmurs and you would never know! We will pay for the xrays and are working on getting her into a vet at this time for a further work up.\n\nFiona, 1 years old, Female pitbull. Fiona is the sweetest puppy you\u2019ll ever meet! She is one of those girls that makes the perfect best friend. She is a little shy at first and does take a little while to warm up, but once she does, she'll be your best friend! This means that she will require someone who will be PATIENT with her and allow her the time she needs to decompress. She loves car rides and is very obedient. You only have to show her once and she\u2019s got it.   She is definitely a people person with a very loyal temperament. She would rather be with you than out playing with the others. She has a very calm, easygoing energy level. If you sit down she wants to lay at your feet (or sit in your lap!). She is house trained and has no problem being put in her kennel. Fiona is cutest when she\u2019s burying herself in her blankets. She is very calm and quiet. It\u2019s very easy to forget she\u2019s there. She is dog friendly, but again, she requires SLOW introductions when meeting any new doggie friends. After being in her foster home for only a week, she showed some signs of being possessive over toys with other dogs, but was easily corrected and allowed for the toy to be taken away from her by her person. She has been cat tolerant but likes to chase them. Decompression is KEY for sweet Fiona. \n\nDue to Fiona's puppy energy we recommend a home with no kids under the age of 12. \n\n***Listed BREED and AGE - We are taking our best guess on age, breed and size when fully grown. We rarely know a dog's exact age nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time.\n\nThe first step in our process is filling out an application. We will review your application as soon as we are able- there are two of us and we do the best that we can. We review applications on a first come first serve basis and look for the best fit/match for dog and applicant.\n\nhttps://heartoftheunderdog.org/adoption-application",

            "description": "Hi.  My name is Pedro and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen me on Facebook.  The thing I most want from Santa this year is a home for Christmas.  This could be a foster home, a foster to adopt home, or just maybe, a forever home of my own!  Right now, I am at a nice boarding facility, but I really want to be at home laying under a tree and waiting to open my stocking.  I am an older guy -- about six years old -- and so am beyond the puppy stage and very calm in the house.  I LOVE people and want to be as close to you as possible.  I like to sit in laps, sleep in your bed, and give kisses (ok, I\u2019m a bit big at around 50lbs for laps but I give it my best shot).  I need a home where I am the only animal because I just love people so much.  I got to do a sleep over in a house with a Christmas tree and didn\u2019t touch it at all and I found out that I really like music.  If you play for me, I\u2019ll go right to sleep at your side.  I am still learning how to walk on a leash \u2013 I mostly do great but I can pull when I get excited so having someone to work with me on that would be helpful.  \n\nI haven\u2019t had the easiest life.  I was a street dog in Detroit and just lost my foster home because of a situation that didn\u2019t have anything to do with me.  The nice lady I did the sleep over with says that I am a sweet soul and will make the right person a wonderful and loyal companion.  My adoption fees are covered by the Un-Shelter and they will also provide free training assistance if my humans would like it.  I am neutered, micro-chipped and have all my shots.  I would love to get out of boarding and in a home so if you can help me in any way, I would show you my gratitude as only a loving older dog can.\n\nPlease  Email theunshelter@gmail.com if you are interested or have any questions!!!",

He is tennis ball obsessed, especially if they squeak. He has a medium energy level. He loves to play ball and tear up toys but also loves to snuggle.\n\nHe spent about a week at a volunteer's house and they said he was very well mannered in the house and is house trained. They could leave him home alone and he didn't get into any trouble.\n\nMaurice know how to sit and is food motivated. He has already started to learn how to give paw.\n\nMaurice should live in an all adult home as he can be possessive of his toys and will need a family who can work on this behavior with him. He would like to be the only pet.\n\n--\n\nOur hours: In an effort to limit the number of visitors at our shelter during this time, visitors are limited to approved applicants only.\n\n\nInstructions on how to fill out our online application are on our website here: https://www.lighthouseanimalshelter.org/application-instructions\n\nWe are receiving a high number of applications at this time. Please be patient with us while we adjust to these new changes and keep in mind that our volunteers process the applications as quickly as their schedules allow.\n\nWe do not adopt on a first-come-first-serve basis, but rather by the best match between dog and family, although we will factor in the order of applications if there are equally good matches.\n\nHow you can help us process your application:\nPlease call all of your references (landlord, if applicable, vet(s) and personal references) before filling out an application to let them know that we will be calling. We are an all-volunteer program and volunteers often make reference calls from their cell phone. It will be a number your personal reference does not recognize. We understand most people will screen their calls from unknown numbers so please tell them to keep an eye on their voicemail and give the volunteer a call back at their earliest convenience. We may end up playing phone tag with your personal references but will reach out to you if we need further assistance in reaching them.\n\nHow we process your application:\nOnce we receive your application, we will check home ownership or landlord permission, personal references and vet references. We will reach out to you if we have questions during the process or if we are having trouble reaching your references either through email or phone. We will contact you when your application is fully processed to discuss how you would like to proceed with your application and to discuss dogs in our care who will be a good match for you and anyone involved in the adoption.\n\nOur adoption fee:\nOur adoption fee is $400 ($415 if paid by PayPal) which covers the costs of vetting (spay, vaccinations, heartworm testing, preventatives while in our care, deworming and microchip) and any boarding or transport fees incurred in each dog's rescue.",

He is good with new people and is kid friendly. Cats are unknown. He likes walks a lot, and taking a long nap after. He is leash trained and house trained. He is up to date on all vaccinations. *** This is a courtesy post, please contact Elizabeth at jesuspolanco2@gmail.com.We do not have a central location to see our dogs.

My past was rough, but I do not live in my past or let it define me. What I do live in is the moments\u2026like when I got my first bath! The water was BLACK when I was done! Then I went for a ride and my foster mom rolled down the windows, I stuck my head out and just smelled the clean country air. When I get to play with other dogs and just enjoy the chase game. Moments of meeting the house cats and realizing they are nice, seeing the chickens and observing them.\n\nI am still figuring out what I enjoy most in my current home. The humans are letting me explore the farm. I am taking a nose work class, since I\u2019m a super sniffer. I will keep you posted on my progress. Happy Trails!",

            "description": "April 2020:  We are not holding public adoption events at this time.  Qualified families are being invited to appointments to meet specific dogs.  There are currently no opportunities to view multiple dogs and adoption events aren't being held at Tractor Supply in Lenoir.\n\nWhether dogs / puppies come in as strays or owner surrenders, we usually have to make our best guess as to birthdate and breed.   \n\nIf adopted into a home with other animals, particularly cats, your new pet should be crated or secured when you're not available to supervise to insure a harmonious relationship.  \n\nA vet reference is required to confirm responsible pet ownership.  We suggest first time pet owners look for an adult dog for companionship and to gain experience through another rescue or your local government-run animal control..\n\nAdoption fee covers two vaccinations plus spay / neuter if using our local low-cost spay/neuter clinic (overnight stay required) and surgery occurs as agreed upon in the adoption contract.  Convenience fee equal to refundable spay/neuter deposit may be added if using our veterinarian.  Additional fees for 3rd puppy vaccination, refundable spay/neuter deposit, etc. may apply.  \n\nWe are an all-volunteer, foster-based rescue.  We receive no funding from agencies.  Available animals can be seen most Saturdays at Tractor Supply in Lenoir from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.  We recommend interested parties contact us to pre-qualify for adoption so their new furry family can go home once paperwork is complete.  Fees are required in cash.  For more information on our organization, our website is www.petpartnersrescue.org.",

Ryker is super active and energetic, will do best in a home that gives him a lot of exercise and attention. No young children and must have experience with large very very high energy dogs.\n\nFoster notes- Ryker 1/31/21\n\nRyker is perhaps the smartest dog I've ever met. He didn't work out in our home for reasons I'll describe below but want to describe some of his wonderful attributes. \n\nHe's insanely smart and curious. Needs intellectual stimulation, would love to work 24/7, almost never relaxes unless worn out (both physically and mentally). Ryker is incredibly devoted and loving to his primary person. He's very trainable, and responds to treats unless distracted. At first he was amenable to being crated, but as our situation became more stressful that degraded\n\nHe'd be best in a house with 2 adults (and not many more) who are experienced with training dogs (unlike us). Our family with teens coming and going was overstimulating for him and he got excitable, then would jump and gnaw at arms and legs. I believe he had no intention to hurt, but couldn't control himself, and couldn't stop. With the right person/ training I think Ryker would be an AMAZING pet.\n\nI also think Ryker would be a great police dog, or search and rescue. He followed gopher trails that were underground (I think that's what he was smelling). I believe his hunting instinct is high- so would avoid small pets. Loves belly rubs and chasing balls, although he gets excitable.",

Our veterinary partner estimates that Noel is 3 years old at the time of intake in December 2020. Noel is good with people and other dogs. Noel was living on the streets. A little dog, at just 11 lbs, he didn't stand a chance when he was attacked by a pack of dogs. Noel was seriously injured in the attack, and then he was just left lying on the street crying in pain. As soon as we heard about Noel, we immediately got him to our veterinary partner where he was put back together. Noel now needs a home where he can feel safe, where he will be loved and where he will know that he will never be homeless again. If you can give Noel that life, please apply online to adopt Noel (TX) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

He is obviously food motivated, who isn't?! During walks, we carry his favorite treats and when a person or other dog comes strolling by Gunner has been learning to relax, sit and wait. He's a work in progress, but he's doing less lunging towards others and more patiently waiting for his treat. He's scared of the basement, loud noises and anything hiding in the dark - big scaredy dog for sure! Gunner has taken a liking to sticks, and his toys! He's finally learning how to play and enjoy life. Since the weather's getting a bit chilly, he is insistent on crawling under the covers and being the best snuggle bug there is Gunner has made many friends and typically remembers them - sometimes it takes some coaxing. However, he is learning that people are not bad and other dogs are just living their best life as he is. Within a few months, I think Gunner will be 50% less reactive to other dogs and be a respectable gentleman on walks.\n\n12/21/20-If you're looking for a companion that enjoys long walks, naps and netflix - Gunner is surely your match!  Gunner is adapting very well! Gunner seems to thrive in an environment with a person to entertain him throughout the day. Recently, he met a new family friend and stayed with them for the day. When meeting new humans he is extremely shy and anxious. Once warmed up he loves every person he meets. The family friend expressed that Gunner seems to walk with a 'Mob Mentality'. He's usually looking around and thinking all the dogs are out to get him. On the flip side, Gunner is a scaredy cat. He runs and hides whenever there is a loud noise or something jumps out when he isn't looking. Gunners best characteristic is teddy bear-like cuddles. He will let you sleep on his back as you both take naps together and certainly doesn't mind snuggling under the covers.\n\n12/16/20  Gunner is looking for a home for the holidays! Coming in at 85 lbs he is a big cuddly bear! He LOVES to get attention. Gunner has been in the foster home for 3 days now. He has become more comfortable and is showing his true loving colors. He seems to love pets and kisses, practically every 10 mins he's looking for attention. He is great at walking on the leash and doesn't pull too often. However, if he sees a squirrel he becomes extremely antsy. Additionally, he is aggressive and when he sees one on the walk he pulls, barks and attempts to interrogate them. I foresee this being trainable and with a strong individual he will be better around other dogs. \n\n12/13/20-Gunner has arrived into rescue, and after a very long day on the road to his foster home, is settling in. He is an owner surrender as he was having bad fights with the other dog in his home & at doggie daycare with other dogs. His owner said Gunner is a very good dog, he just needs to be the only pet. She also said he listens well, he's funny, goofy & well mannered. Please check back soon as we get to know him better.",

I've lived in the Northeast for the last three years so hiking in the snow does not scare me. I'm spayed so I'm not your next fling in the dog park. Please swipe left if that's what you are looking for!\n\nRaven is a 3 yr spayed rottie who would prefer to be the only pet in your family. Older kids are ok, but the young ones are too rambunctious and scary. Fully vetted and ready now.\n\nPlease visit our web site at 4theloveofdog.org for all adoption information",

I also like to try different treats, like today I had cheese and potato chips!!\nThis is what I dream about when I dream about my perfect person or family: I would love a family who wants to go for long walks and the kids would want to play with me and we can have cook outs and make smores and then at night we can all cuddle and watch TV. My family was really sad to give me up but they said I was a great dog who loved to run and dig in the yard when playing with my female canine friends. I hope my new family will love me as much as my other family did so that I can be happy again. I am a staff favorite here by the way !!\n\nAdoption Process: all meets are being done by appt only so please fill out an online app and once processed we will email you with next steps. It takes 24-48 hours to process apps\n\n",

This handsome fella is super sweet, attentive and affectionate with his humans (he is one world class cuddler and gives the best kisses). He is a medium energy dog who wants nothing more than to cuddle with you on the couch but is also down to walk a couple of miles or go on some light to moderate hikes to keep you nice and trim. Other activities that Jordan enjoys include playing with his stuffed animals, napping like a pro, playing fetch and being one giant lap/velcro dog with his humans! He is also house-trained, walks great on the leash, is non-reactive, follows directions/corrections well, and knows some basic commands (sit, down, wait, etc.).\n\nPlease come adopt this handsome boy so that he can have a loving family of his own! At this moment, Jordan will do best in a home without any young children or small animals. With an experienced adopter and after slow and proper introduction/socialization, he can be around mellow, even tempered dogs that are around medium to large sized.\n\n\nYou can see more photos and videos of Jordan living the foster life via Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/tail.of.two.bullies/.\n\n",

            "description": "A kind citizen sponsored part of my adoption fee! \n\nLola is a very active 5-7year old lab/border collie mix who came in with her housemate Lilly. Lily has already been adopted but Lola is still looking for her perfect home. She is very playful and loves to go for walks and enjoys the weather outside. Her fur allows her to withstand some colder temperatures, so she is able to enjoy playing in the snow. With that being said she does shed A LOT. So she will need to be brushed on a regular basses. Potential adopters beware,  black hair will be everywhere. Lola absolutely loves playing with toys, especially stuffed plushies. She is not the most graceful girl, she's like a bull in a china shop, she tends to be a little rough when playing so I don't think she would do well in a home with small children. Because she has a high prey drive, she probably wouldn't do well in a home with cats either. Lola is a cuddle bug and will come up to have her butt scratched. She's a talker, so she will let you know how her day is going and if she wants something. \nIf you want to come visit with Ms. Lola fill out an adoption application and contact the shelter today!\n**COVID PROCEDURE***  Please fill out an adoption application at www.cedar-rapids.org/animal. After the application is submitted, a staff member will contact you to schedule an appointment to meet the pet!\n\n* The spay/ neuter surgery is included in the adoption fee of $125.\n\n* We always prefer that our animals go to indoor homes.\n\n*OWNING a pet is a life time commitment!  Please be ready to make that commitment before you adopt a pet!\n\n*BREED DISCLOSURE: Due to the fact that most of our adoptable pets are strays, we can not guarantee their breed. We list the pets breed as the one that best matches the physical appearance, temperament, and personality of the animal-in some cases it's purely a guess. The pet may also be listed as a mix when it\u2019s actually a purebred.",

Spencer is very gentle and loves to hang out on my lap. When he gets comfortable he will play. He has a very goofy play run. Spencer walks really nicely on a leash. If you are looking for a sweetheart of a dog, call the shelter and make an appointment to come and meet him!\n\n**COVID PROCEDURE***  Please fill out an adoption application at www.cedar-rapids.org/animal.

Please be ready to make that commitment before you adopt a pet!\n\n*BREED DISCLOSURE: Due to the fact that most of our adoptable pets are strays, we can not guarantee their breed.

Our veterinary partner estimates that Cody is a year old at the time of intake in December 2020. Cody is good with people, other dogs, and even cats! This adorable Terrier found himself homeless at just a year old. But now that he's a Rescue Dogs Rock NYC pup, he won't be homeless for long! Cody is a sweet boy who has always dreamt of life in a safe and loving home with lots of toys and treats. He has quickly learned that walking on a leash is fun and exciting! With lots of energy, Cody needs a strong leader who can provide training, daily walks, and the structure he needs to thrive. Cody loves belly rubs, head scratches, tennis balls, fluffy toys, humans, dogs, & even cats! If you would like to apply for the job of being Cody's human, and you can give Cody the active, safe, happy life he's dreaming of, please apply to adopt Cody (TX) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

He needs a family who will be extra patient with him, and who preferably has previous experience with dogs. The NMDR Behavior Manager will talk to prospective adopters to explain the work we've done with him, and what will be the best home situation for him. To submit an application to adopt Ewok, visit https://nmdr.org/our-dogs/adopt/\n\n\n\nFun Facts about Ewok\n\nSuper cute\n\nEnjoys sunshine and fresh air\n\nQuiet and gentle\n\n\n\nChallenges for Ewok\n\nWorking on being brave with people\n\nScared of loud noises, new people, etc\n\nWorking on his social skills with other dogs, but sometimes doesn't get along with them\n\n\n\nTo submit an application to adopt Ewok, visit https://nmdr.org/our-dogs/adopt/\n\n\n\n-----\n\nPrior to being rescued, many of our dogs have experienced minimal socialization. As a result, there is often an adjustment period when learning about life as a family pet. We typically do not adopt to homes with children under 6 years old; homes with older children will be considered on an individual basis. Common skills such as house training and leash walking will often take a little extra time. Patience, understanding and a gentle hand are a must. The great news is, most of these dogs come around rather quickly and being a part of their rehabilitation is an extremely rewarding experience.

She is a little pup with a lot of personality and is sure to be the queen of her forever home. When Grace is not playing hard with her foster sister she is the ultimate cuddle bug. Grace is good with other dogs and loves a furry playmate. This sweetie would be great with kids and other family members who can handle her energy. She loves treats and has already learned to sit. She is working on potty training and is very close to no accidents! She will sleep in her crate at night with minimal fussing but Grace would rather snuggle under the covers with you. This little lady is ready for a forever home!\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2020 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq",

She was attacked in the shelter on 3 separate occasions and is very anxious around other dogs so needs to be in a dog only home, no cats.  She needs a yard to get her exercise in so no apts.  She walks well on leash but can become defensive if she sees another dog, which is to be expected given her history.  She has no history of aggression to humans.",

He was very interested in all the smells, and he eagerly explored with a loose body and wagging tail. He has good leash manners and was a pleasure to walk. He stood at my side and was attentive as a cyclist went by, but there was no pulling. He noticed other dogs on our walk, but again no pulling. He was unimpressed with my low-value treats, but took some more cheese with a gentle mouth. Dylan is a handsome and well- mannered gentleman, who should do well in a quiet home with a patient partner. Dylan needs to meet any resident pets before heading home. Ask about this hunk today!",

This sweet, happy senior gal has quickly become a staff and volunteer favorite, and we're all hoping her stay at the shelter is as brief as possible. Ivy has some standard old lady problems. She may not hear or see all that well, but her tail never stops wagging and she seems to adore every person she meets. She's gentle, affectionate, polite on leash and loves snacks. This deserving old girl does not like being in her kennel, and seems a bit overwhelmed by all the barking and shelter activity around her. If you have a cozy, quiet home for a very deserving dog, please ask about Ivy!! Ivy has done well when meeting other dogs at PACC, saying hello and enjoying the other dogs' presence. Don't miss out on this gem!",

He is clean, well potty trained, quiet unless he has to go potty, walks easy on leash, low maintenance - likes to just hang out in the yard or on his bed.  He is friendly with people, but does not like his things touched.  He would be best suited in a home with a senior couple or someone who just wants a companion dog and not looking to go on long hikes or crowded places.  He can be a bit nervous with too much activity.  He is in good health and up to date on his vaccinations.",

Twelve years old, 10 pounds overweight, and gray in the face. Hold. Us. Back. Ruby falls into the \"our major weakness\" category, which is senior and bumpy. This puggle was loved once, but her former owner has health problems that increasingly disabled him over the years, and after a long while without being able to give his pup proper care, he is now hospitalized and Ruby is on the hunt for her golden years forever home. She came to us reeking of cigarette smoke, with open sores under her tight collar, and with painful ear infections. She's well on her way to healing and slimming down now, and that butt thing (it looks like a tiny water balloon) is not particularly worrisome according to our vet's testing, but it may need to be retested and/or removed down the line. Ruby is an easy going delight in the behavior department. She's chill, tough to faze, totally housebroken, great with other dogs, and trusting. Also super treat motivated, which makes her an awesome photo model. She'll be happiest in a low key home with humans ready for the highs and lows of old dog care and where she can get a few gentle walks a day and plenty of opportunities to lie by your feet. Intrested in adopting? Please go to www.socialteesnyc.org \n\nHer Foster Says: Ruby is a giant potato of puggle goodness. That face. She looks up at you with those big dark eyes and that frowny mug...STUNNING! As shes settled in, Ruby has started to seek out our affection more and more often, coming over for scratches and pets...shes on her way to becoming a total love sponge! It simply takes a good scratch under her chin and down her neck for her to lift up her head and reveal that the frown in the center of her face is really just the middle of an enormous smile!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This animal is not at the Social Tees office all of our dogs and cats are in foster homes while they wait to find their forever families. :) If youd like to apply to adopt this pet, please complete an adoption application at socialteesnyc.org. Because we are a small team and receive hundreds of applications each week, we are unable to respond to every application and every inquiry email, but we do our best. Please have patience! If your application is approved, you will for sure hear from us. If you have questions, please take a look at the Adoption and Fostering FAQs etc. on our website as all common questions are answered there. Thank you for your understanding and flexibility as we work to save these innocent lives!! \n\nLEARN MORE ABOUT US: socialteesnyc.org; Instagram via @socialteesnyc; Facebook.com/socialteesanimalrescue",

We have no idea where he came from as he was found standing in front of a garage door in a residential neighborhood frozen with fear. No one in the area recognized him at all. Joey has come along way since his rescue however he needs to move onto his forever home. He will need someone with lots of love and patience, someone that will enjoy taking all of Joey\u2019s baby steps towards recovery with him. Joey will blossom, he just needs time and a very special somebody. If you think you could be Joey\u2019s special someone please consider meeting him. His adoption fee is $350.",

            "description": "Buster is a cute little guy. He is 13 years old and around 8 lbs. He is house trained and leash trained. However, we always say that our dogs need a refresher course when they join your home. He came in with his friend Johnny (senior basset/dachshund mix) after their elderly owner passed away. Johnny just for adopted 1/16/21 and settled into his swell new home immediately. He picks which dogs he likes. He is used to living with adults rather than kids. We got him neutered and his teeth cleaned.\nPlease find our applications and valuable information under 'Adopt a dog'* on our website: *www.beaglesandbuddies.com* and email your application to beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Let us know your preference of appointment day/time and which dogs you are interested in and we will do our best to accommodate and email you the closest appointment available. Please allow us up to a week to get back to you. Most appointments will be Friday-Sunday, 10 am - 2 pm, for an hour.\n*Note bring any other dog/s and the entire family to your meet and greet at B&B.* A complimentary training manual is included with each adoption, authored by terristeuben.com. Check out her website - she is fabulous!\nB&B is glad to be open during the pandemic. We know the value and comfort of a loving pet companion and are doing our best to help the dogs and folks who need them. We update our website daily and are always rescuing, vetting, rehabilitating, socializing.\n* We are accepting applications for volunteers to spend time with our dogs, hang out, sing/read to the shy ones, walk/toss ball with those who go to the playgrounds; cleaning, office work, gardening, and building/repair projects! *\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment. Please look at our website and make a list of one or more dogs that you would like to see.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf you have a question about adopting, giving up a dog, boarding, or volunteering, please visit the appropriate tabs on our\nhome page.\n\nFor more specific questions, call 626-444-9664 (please leave a voicemail if no answer) or email at beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Note that\nEmailing\nis always preferred!\n\nThanks!\n\nPlease note: If you are viewing this profile anywhere other than Beagles & Buddies own website, you are not receiving full info.

She is a total cuddle-bug who sometimes tries to crawl in your lap.\n\nWhether it's belly rubs or chin scratches, she loves to be pet. If you stop petting her, she will put her paw on you to make sure you didn't forget about her. She'll also curl up quietly by your side as you work or go about your day.\n\nOutside, Jaja is a champion hiker, happily hiking for miles over rocks, streams and snow. She's house trained and kid friendly, and would love to find a quiet home with a fenced in yard!\n\nInterested in adding Jaja to your family? Apply online today!\n\nIf you are interested in adding this pup to your family, please submit an application at www.petrescuealliance.com. All questions will be answered and meet and greets set up following a review of application. If the dog is listed on our website or Petfinder, they are still available! Pet Rescue Alliance does our best to provide accurate information about the dogs we have available for adoption. We cannot make any guarantees about age, breed or temperament.",

He loves walks and loves affection. His best option would be an active home with a fenced yard, as this boy has energy to burn. We are not sure how he would be with other animals or kids, but a dog meet would be required if you have another dog and bring the kids along when you schedule a meet. Apply online then call the shelter 609-265-5073 to set up an appointment to meet sweet boy, Bic!",

His former home said he was an escape artist, but he's been in his foster home for months and he hasn't made one attempt to make a break for it (4' Kentucky 3 board fence), so we feel confident in saying he was left outside alone for long periods before finding an escape route.\n\nHe pulls on a leash, so isn't the best walking partner. Pip is food obsessed. We don't mean that he's like the rest of us who've put on the Covid pounds, we mean he's obsessed to the point he'll walk through you to get to food. He's not picky, any kibble, treats or people food are must haves (although he'll turn his nose up at green beans). For this reason, we are looking for a home where he'll be the only pet. He's great with cats and dogs that he encounters, but his obsession with food can lead to fights\n\n* 9 years old\n\n* Needs a fenced yard\n\n* Friendly with everyone but needs to be an only pet\n\nOur adoption application can be found on our website, www.pawprintsnky.com",

            "description": "AVAILABLE as on 1/31/21\n\nDuke is around 3yrs old, weighs around 50lbs, and is a sweet and playful boy. We are guessing that he is a hound, mountain cur, lab mix, but do not know for sure if he is any or all of these breeds. He is energetic and does well with people and other dogs. He is a little too rough for a home with kitties. Due to his energy level we are looking for a home who has a decent sized and secure fenced in yard for him. He would ideally also have a playful doggie sibling in his new home, but this is not a requirement at this time. He is neutered, up to date on vaccinations, and is awaiting a forever home. If you believe Duke would be a fit please submit an application (link below)\n\nAdoption Application:\nhttps://airtable.com/shr305FuyR4v4JWQb\n\nFacebook Link:\nhttps://m.facebook.com/furrytalesanimalrescue/\n\nWebsite Link: https://furrytalesrescue.wixsite.com/home\n\n** We are based out of Blue Bell, PA. We allow out of state adoptions to NJ, MD, DE, and NY. At this time we do not adopt out to homes who are over 120 miles from our location. We do prioritize more local applications who are a match for the dog/puppy they are applying for.**\n\n",

No\nGood with kids?\nEnergy Level: \tHigh\nNeeds a fenced in yard? \nAdoption Fee: $\nAny other info:\n\nMeet Keeba!\n\nThis dapper gent is a 4 year old Boxer mix with a wonderful personality looking for a forever home for the holidays. \n\nKeeba is such a good boy! He is intelligent and eager to please. He already knows how to sit, lay down, and give his paw for yummy treats and is currently working on his manners. He is a big boy but for some reason seems to think he is a perfect lap dog.\n\nKeeba loves a good game of fetch or tug of war. And he will be your best friend forever if you play with him! He has a ton of fun boxer energy, is super playful, and extremely loyal and protective of his people. \n\nKeeba does great with routines and consistency. He would do best in a home with a loving diligent owner who will continue to work on his training and keep Keeba mentally and physically exercised. \n\nKeeba has an infectious smile and he's really proud of his giant ears as you can see from the pictures. Although Keeba has a great personality, he is looking for a home as an only child with no other animals. Because of this, we know it may be harder to find Keeba the perfect home. But that's why we need your help!\n\nPlease share Keeba's adorable smile far and wide. We just know his perfect family is out there waiting to meet him. Keeba is neutered, up to date on vaccines, and microchipped.\n\n\nOur adoption fees include the pets spay or neuter, microchip, up to date vaccines, heartworm/tick disease testing and fecal check.  All adoption fees can be found on our groups' Petfinder page. \nThe first step to our adoption process is to please fill out and adoptions application, it can be found on our website www.serenityanimalhospital.net, under the \"Adopt From Us\" Tab.\nPlease email the application to adoptions@serenityanimalhospital.net or drop it off in person during our business hours.

Starbucks loves playing tug of War with her foster sister or her foster mom. She plays and runs as fast as her legs will carry her even before she has had her morning coffee. Starbucks is crate trained but is an escape artist and does better left out. She loves pretty much anyone she meets, including large and small dogs, cats, and kids. She does well on a leash, and rides great in the car.

Please read our Frequently Asked Questions and Adoption Processed Explained documentation.\n_________ B I O ______________\n\nName: Digit\nSize: ~Large range: 61-100 lbs\nAdoption Donation: $250 (applicable sales tax included). Adoption fees may be paid by cash or check.\nOther: Spayed Female, Vaccinations current, Microchip, Older considerate children only\n\nDigit is super sweet and happy!!\n\nFoster Home Feedback\n\n*\nDigit has allergies and requires 2 medications to control them, one is a daily tablet and the other is an injection given every 4-6 weeks. The daily tablet costs about $99 per month and the injection costs around $135 per injection\n\n1/23/21: Digit has been with us now for over two months and we are really starting to learn her personality. She loves her sleep; she honestly spends most of her day sleeping unless she thinks you are doing something interesting that she needs to follow you. Digit doesn't like the cold. She will hold her bladder for a long time in an attempt to not go outside but she's never had an accident. She goes out and does what she needs to do as fast as she can so she can get back in the warmth. We were working on walks but haven't been out a lot since it's gotten colder out.\n\nWe leave her out of her kennel at night and she's good about sleeping in her bed, although if you wanted her to sleep in her bed with you she would definitely not turn you down. Digit does well in her kennel when we are gone. She is in there for some extended hours when we work and never rips up anything or has an accident.\n\nDigit does well with our resident Chihuahua. Our Chi doesn't want much to do with her and Digit is good about leaving him alone. Sometimes she gets playful and tries to play with him and it's obvious she doesn't realize her size but listens well when told to leave him alone. She does well with our cat also. Our cat isn't very nice and perches above her and hits her but Digit doesn't retaliate.\n\nDigit has always been friendly when anyone comes to the house and wants all the pets. In her previous house, she lived with 3 young kids and did well; she just again doesn't realize how big she is so older kids would be for the best. Digit is still on her meds for her allergies and is doing well with those.\n\n12/10/2020: Digit loves people, she will follow you around the house and rest at your feet. She gets along with dogs and cats. She does well in the kennel. Digit is potty trained and has never had an accident with us. She is a pretty chill, low energy dog. She really enjoys relaxing in her bed or on the couch. She will get bouts of playfulness and loves a good game of catch.\n\nDigit gets excited for walks, but they are a work in progress. She has protective/anxious tendencies. We have been working on some behavior modifications and she is very treat-motivated. Her bark is worse than her bite and by that I mean she never bites but has that low, protective pit bull bark. Digit has allergies and takes Apoquel once a day and does a Cytopoint injection once a month. She takes her pill very well though. Digit would love to meet you and show you how good she is at snuggling.To view additional dogs available for adoption, please see our website: www.4luvofdog.org",

ORANGE\u2013 Dogs in the ORANGE category are commonly timid and will need some confidence building at first. Once dogs in the ORANGE category are comfortable, they will most likely be energetic and needing similar guidance to dogs that are in the YELLOW category. Dogs in the ORANGE category sometimes benefit from another confident canine in the home.\n\nDogs are assigned to color categories using any previous owner notes, general handling, as well as staff and volunteer observations. As we continue to get to know the dogs and gather further insights into their personalities, colors may be adjusted accordingly.\n\nRancho Coastal Humane Society remains temporarily closed to the general public, but we have companion animals in our care that are ready for adoption BY APPOINTMENT ONLY, and our staff is ready to make that happen! Please visit our website for updates and more information. Thank you for your interest. \n\nAdoption Hours: Monday-Sunday; 11 AM to 4:30 PM\n\nAddress: 389 Requeza Street, Encinitas, CA 92024",

He has *a lot* of growing and filling out to do. He's ALL puppy in behavior. He loves to  run, is always doing zoomies, and can't get enough of this snow. He especially loves making those snow angels and living in the moment. He has no manners or training under his belt whatsoever and is pretty much clueless about any and all  etiquette. He is  extremely mouthy ( the hard mouthy that could easily result in bruising)  and is quite  powerful. He needs a strong and firm owner experienced with the breed (he loves to push boundaries and set the rules, which he cannot be allowed to do).  He *does* respond to those who take control with him which is great.  He is a big jumper and will fly into you at warp speed and easily knock over adults and keep going.  He has a lot of energy and will need some big outlets for  that in conjunction with the training . He's extremely goofy and will make you laugh often, but he needs a lot of work overall. The good news is he is still a pup and has a great personality under all that unruly behavior.  Once he gets some training under his belt while he is still young, and before he gets overly powerful,  he will make an excellent companion. \n\nHe will come fixed, chipped,vaccinated, and move in ready. He will also have his cherry eye surgically repaired. \n\n***If you are serious about adopting, you must first complete and submit an application on our website. We will not do anything without a completed application. Do not contact us through pet finder or emails us as All info is contained here***\n\nPlease be sure to read all about our organization before you apply to adopt. If you are serious about adopting you must complete an application on our website. There is information on our petfinder home page and our website www.phoenixanimalrescue.com .

Be sure to tell them ARK sent you! #ARKforCharlieBoyBrown #JustSaveThem\n\nMeet Charlie Boy Brown! He\u2019s a 4-year old, approx 45-pound male hound mix located in Hull, MA and in need of a foster or adopter. If you want a handsome man around, then we\u2019ve got you covered. With his dreamy eyes and spotted white coat with brindle patchwork, he is a looker!\n\nOriginally from the Volunteer State of Tennessee, Charlie likes adventures in the woods so he can do what he does best \u2013 sniffin' things out. He is quite the character and would love an active home that will take him on adventures like hikes and long walks! \n\nHe also loves car rides and would make an excellent copilot for those boring errands. He\u2019s young and active but he does come with an OFF switch because he is a champion napper! He is a good guard dog too and will alert you to people and dogs passing by. Apartment living isn\u2019t suitable for his vocal iterations though. But hey, that\u2019s what hounds do and Charlie Boy Brown takes his job seriously.\n\nIdeally, he would benefit with structure and a daily routine in the home to keep things consistent! He would also benefit by working with a trainer in his new home to help with some basic training and eliminate some of that barking. He loves to learn and is very food motivated so training will not be difficult. Charlie Boy Brown\u2019s ideal family is adult only and has experience owning dogs. Since he is a bit of the jealous type, he should be the only pet in the house! He is also wary of kids who come off as scary and unpredictable to him. Mature teens are ok though! \n\nSo how about it? Want a partner for a walk on the beach or the piney woods followed by dinner and a nap? If you are interested in adopting or fostering, please fill out an application at survivortails.org or email adoptions@survivortails.org with any questions.

He is timid at first, but once he warms up to you all he wants is pets and scratches! Stereo is more fearful of men than women, but if given time, patience and love he will warm right up. He enjoys long walks, hikes and with training would be a great jogging buddy. He prefers to sleep on his doggy bed over the couch. Loves Happy Howe's lamb log but isn't a fan of peanut butter. Enjoys car rides and will act as a co-captain in the front seat. He needs a human with previous dog experience that has time to spend acclimating him to his new home. Up until he came to the rescue he had never been in a home before - so there is lots for him to learn about - sounds, smells, spaces, etc.\nStereo is crate trained, house trained, and leash/walk trained (ie does not pull and is not reactive on leash). Needs a calmer home with experienced owners. Does well with other dogs, but can be territorial of his crate and toys.",

            "description": "Meet gorgeous, elegant and smart sweet Loba\n\nShe is around 12 months old young - She is an unusual American White Shepherd and Australian Kelpie. \n\nLoba is loving, sweet, loves to play chasing the ball as you can see in some of her pics - She is an active 4 leg girl .\n\nShe gets along with all dogs and is being fostered with some cats; although they don't get them mixed; but she knows they are there -\n\nShe will be ideal as running partner, and just a buddy to cuddle with.\nShe loves to fetch, and she is crate trained.\n\nLoba is very smart; she will learn quick once you get her trained to your home environment.\n\nShe was left tied up with a chain in an empty building - she was starving - she was nursed back to health and she loves to eat and run.\n\nShe is about 50 pounds and probably has reached her full growth. Perfect medium size\n\nAs with all rescued fury kids; they are going to need training, love reinforcement; as you know they all come from a tough beginning on their lives and the art of adopting a rescued creature is to bring them to be the best they can be with love and patience.\n\nTheir adoption fee includes being spayed/neutered, they have received their 3 core puppy vaccines, dewormed, and a free health check up through a local participating vet clinic.\n\nReady to give them a forever home? Please follow the instructions and start with completing an application at the following link: http://aaofus.org/adoption-application.html\n\nWe are scheduling meet & greet adoption appointments and keeping a distance protocol. No appointments will be made unless we have received an application; therefore, we can match you with the best fit for you. In addition, to keep you safe and healthy as well as our pups that don't need to be handle by too many people. Appointments are scheduled late afternoons.\n\nPlease text at 619-576-0747 or email veronica.aaofusa@gmail.com or visit our website at www.aaofus.org and complete our application at the following link:\nhttp://aaofus.org/adoption-application.html\n\nDue to high volume of calls; NO PHONE calls are accepted at this time - therefore, please text us or email us.\n\nLIVE!! LOVE!!! RESCUE!! ADOPT A HOMELESS PET AND SAVE A LIFE!!!\n\nFollow us on Instagram @aaofus",

Maxwell enjoys casual strolls and can even walk next to a bike! He is easy to walk on leash, especially with a front clip harness. He doesn't need much exercise, just lots of love! Maxwell doesn't have much interest in toys but he will gladly sleep in your bed, if you'll let him. He doesn't care much about your space, so a house or apartment living would suit him just fine. If you're looking for a buddy to cuddle on the couch and shower you with unconditional love, Maxwell is your dog!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Maxwell go to la.bestfriends.org/adopt and fill out our Dog Adoption Survey and our team will reach out to you!",

He will need a secure fence for his safety and he needs to be the only dog. He takes a bit to warm up to men but will then bond to them. He loves women. He was a major rehab after being run over by a truck and trailer and almost losing his life. He\u2019s now a tripod which doesn\u2019t slow him down a bit. He will totally be a loyal dog for the right person.  His name, Demo, is because he looked like he had been through a demolition derby. He is only adoptable within 3 hours of Granbury, Tex.

She is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4521706.\n\nMistletoe is a stunning young boxer mix. She is not doing well in the shelter environment and very timid and shy. She will need a rescue or adopter who has patience and time to socialize her and bring her out of her shell. She's tolerated other dogs in the play yard, but hasn't played or socialized much because she's so nervous. She may do well in a home with another calm dog. It is unknown how she will react to cats. Because she is still learning to trust people she will be best in a home without young children. If you'd like to meet Mistletoe please visit the Maricopa County Shelter.\n\nTo visit with this pup, please make an appointment here: https://mcaccappointments.as.me/adopt. NOTE: People who sign up for these appointments often no-show, and we have seen that you can generally show up and let them know you are there to meet this particular dog and the shelter will squeeze you in, except from 12-3PM or closer to the 6PM closing time. (Please know this is not a guarantee). If the dog is at risk, please ask for a supervisor to meet that particular dog.\n\n*Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG. MCACC is located at 2500 S. 27th Avenue, Phoenix. Different adoption fees/policy may apply. Please visit MCACC's website http://www.maricopa.gov/pets/locations.aspx for hours. You may also wish to call 602-506-7387 (PETS) and provide the animal's A# above to verify is still available.",

I'm about eight or nine years old so have all that naughty puppy stuff out of the way. I can be a little skittish at first but then I become velro. I love playing with other dogs and with my humans. I am a perfect size--about 35 lbs and I love to give love. I live in a house with dogs of all sizes and breeds and do well with them. I am housetrained and crate trained though I cause a little ruckus when I first have to go in my crate. I am a healthy boy and appear alot younger than my estimated age. I came from the streets in Louisana and was found after the last hurricane. I'd love to have a family of my own and have a human to love on and a couch to sleep on.",

He is a 7 year old Akita/pit bull mix who currently weighs around 85 pounds. He's a pretty easygoing guy who is content to chill out with his person. He likes to chase an occasional toy, take a walk here and there, and get his belly rubbed. Butt scratches are great, too! Archer has been fully vetted and his fee is $125.\n\nArcher is looking for a somewhat quiet and calm home. He needs a home without young kids and would prefer to be the only pet in the house. He would make a lovely companion! He loves his people loyally and completely.\n\nNOTE: We are closed to the public but are doing adoptions via private appointment once an application has been completed and approved. Applications can be submitted right at our website, mchs.rescuegroups.org.\n\nWe are located at 101 22nd St. SE in Austin, right next to the airport. It's exit 180B off of I-90, right off of 218 South.\n\nWe do require that potential adopters be at least 21 years old and that any resident dogs be up to date on vaccinations, heartworm testing/preventative, and spayed or neutered.",

Applications will be reviewed as soon as possible. Please, no phone calls. If you have specific questions, please email adoption@popememorialcvhs.org \nPlease tell them ARK sent you!!!\n\nMeet Mardi, a 2-year old, 49-pound American Staffordshire who resides at Pope Memorial Humane Society in Dover, NH. This beautiful white & brindle purebred has one wish and that\u2019s a fur-ever home for the new year! She is spayed, healthy, up-to-date on vaccines, and now that she\u2019s been DNA-breed tested, she holds her head just a little bit higher.  \n\nMardi\u2019s favorite activities include walks, playtime, and nose work. Her food motivation has served her well in both work and play, and she is \u201cbusting her tail\u201d on training that will help her be more settled around fellow canines. Winter is the perfect time to adopt Mardi, as shelter staff recently discovered she enjoys romping and somersaulting in snow! Additionally, she has a heart of gold, and loves being loved by people.\n\nMardi will need an active but calm home, as well as one with no children under 14. This excitable pup has also asked to be an only fur child. Shelter staff members have been doing positive reinforcement training to reduce Mardi\u2019s dog reactivity, and her fur-ever family will need to continue working with her. Mardi is a special pup who\u2019s been waiting four months for a home, so if you think you could be her person, don\u2019t wait another minute to apply for this bundle of joy!\n\nApplications must be submitted online: https://popememorialcvhs.org/adoption-application/.

I will get more training to help me with this! When I am home, I love getting pet and will snuggle up close to get belly rubs. Smelling things is my favorite hobby, whether it be around the house or on walks! I love to be outside exploring the sights and the sounds of the yard, and I really love taking my human along on walks. I get very excited when I see other dogs and I want to go up to them and say hello. If I get too overwhelmed, however, I can be pretty noisy. I'm an adventurer at heart, so if I am left alone outside too long, I may get bored and decide to go explore the neighborhood, despite the fence! I'd dobest in a home withchildren 13 years and older.\n\nGeneral Socialization Notes:\n\n I'm a sweet boy and a little shy meeting new people. I do warm up quickly. I like my crate, especially if there is food inside. I love to play with other dogs. I am a smart boy and will love to continue training.\n\nDoes Sheriff like other pets?\n\nI absolutely love to play with other dogs, it's one of my favorite things! We can get loud and rambunctious but it's all in good fun. I gotreally excited when I saw a cat on one of my walks and would need to figure out how I feel about them before committing to living with one.\n\nDoes Sheriff like children?\n\nI haven't met any children while I've been with my fosters, but I like to jump, chase, and gently nip when I'm excited, so I'd probably do best around children over 13.\n\nFavorite Toys:\n\nI like Kongs stuffed with my favorite foods, and NylaBones. Tennis balls are also fun to chase but I'd prefer to be playing with another dog or human instead of an inanimate object!\n\nIdeal Forever Home:\n\nMy ideal foreverhome would have another dog who likes to play, and a yard with at least a six foot fence! I am learning how to work for treats, and I would like to continue my undergrad in good boy-ism! A home without cats or small children would be ideal, along with a family who has a lot of love (and belly rubs) to give!",

Can\u00a0 you believe no one wanted to snatch this cute boy up?! Us either, that is why we jumped on it when someone sent us his story.\n\nHe had been surrendered to the shelter in Billings, not once but 3 times, prior to being dropped at the Vet Clinic!!! He was dropped at the vet clinic to be euthanized as the shelter was going to do just that if he was dropped off again. Due to no fault of his own, he just got very talkative at night, and his family didn't know what to do and why he was doing it. Apparently they didn't know he needs to RUN!!\n\nSo the vet clinic reached out to us and we said YES!\n\nHe is really thriving in rescue. He runs about 5-10miles a day. He does get talkative when he sees rescue mom getting things ready for our runs. Otherwise he sleeps like a baby during the day and night!! As he was able to get all his energy out during the day! \n\nHE Loves the other dogs. Has free roam of the house when rescue mom is at work. Still kennels up when needed. He knows how to play fetch now, although maybe not his favorite thing. He loves to run, snuggle, and play with the other dogs. He likes to patrol the yard and loves that he has a dog door and he can go in and out as he pleases. He really is the sweetest!! Whoever ends up with him will be getting an angel of a dog with such a big heart.\n\n\nIf interested in him, please fill out an application and email it to us--located under the FORMS section on the website listed below.\n\nwww.pawstopeaksrescue.com",

I love running around the snow, and although I get overexcited when I see other dogs, I promise that I just want to play. My favorite place in my new home is under my foster mom's lap, guilt tripping her into giving me treats. I am a gentle soul and tire easily therefore I cherish my time on the couch. Please reach out to my foster mom for a chance to get to know me.\n\nIntake: Stray. APO Pick Up\nAge: 4Y\nSex: Female\nAltered: No\n\nMedical Observation: \n12/21 (Vet Check)-- Patient remains very anxious in kennel. She is staying on bed, whale eyeing, and low growling. Was able to coax off bed to accept a treat which is an improvement from yesterday but not enough to removal from kennel. Will continue to re-attempt. \n12/20 (Vet Check)-- Patient is too nervous to be removed from kennel for examination of ears. Starting course of trazodone and reattempt daily.\n12/19 (Intake Exam)-- Eyes - Irritated around eye\nEars - Possibly infected; dirty - was cleaned\n\nBehavior Observation: \n12/22 (Per Foster Staff)--Kennel Presentation--Nervous. Came to kennel door when I approached, ears back but gave small tail wag. She is very food motivated so will approach if offered treats. Took treats politely through kennel door. Sniffed my hand and leash nicely, but dodges/backs away from leash. Eventually was able to loop her and she exited on her own. On return she stepped right into the kennel and I removed the leash easily.\nLeash Skills--Pulls Minimally On Leash. Walked with tail tucked initially, after some time out of kennel walked confidently with tail high, minimal pulling on leash.\nHandleability--Loose/Allows all handling. I offered her treats and she would approach every time, giving small tail wags. She initially was tense but still allowed handling. Allowed petting all over. Doesn't solicit much attention at first but will come to you if you call to her. After spending half an hour with her in the office, she loosened up considerably and solicited lots of attention by leaning against me, wagging her tail and laying her head on my arm or lap. She then spent almost an hour napping on a bed in the office. Go slow, needs time to warm up to people after leaving kennel but then is friendly and social.\nTag--Did not attempt. Toys--No interest. Very food motivated, ignored toys.\nColor Level--Blue. TTA. Sweet girl, very nervous in kennel and difficult to remove from kennel. Does very well once she is out.\n12/20 (Per Vet)-- Tense, hard barking, whale eyeing with dilated pupils, piloerection and refusing to come to door\n12/19 (Per APO)-- dog showed Scared but to Be safe from dog we still used control stick on dog while leaving apartment dog had urine all over carpet by elevator, was able to bring her to truck and able to get in truck. As i took picture of dog she show simple command like sit or lay down looks healthy \n\n\nThis animal is currently available from foster care through ACCT Philly's Adoptions Programs.

Pickles is reactive to other dogs on a leash and is coming back to us as she\u2019s hard to manage in her previous adopter\u2019s dog filled neighborhood. Please read her entire write up below. \n\nAdoption coordinator Kathy \n\nMeet Pickles! She\u2019s a beautiful mixed breed dog who is 3 yrs old and weighs 45lbs. She was originally an owner surrender to a vet\u2019s office in the south. She has medium energy and bonds quickly to her people. She loves being pet and being with her humans, so a home where she isn\u2019t left alone often is a must. She lived with several other dogs in the south and was ok with them. Since being up here, she is acting aggressively to other dogs on walks. She will try to get out of her collar or harness to go after other dogs. She needs a home with a tall (at least 6 ft) fence that is secure and can\u2019t be climbed. She can likely climb a chain link fence. If no fence, then an ideal home is one where she can be routinely kept away from other dogs. She needs a home where she is the only pet as is not good with small animals or cats. She\u2019s house trained and does ok on a leash when not distracted by other animals,  but is strong and will need continued training not to pull.  She would do best in an active home. Despite everything written above, she is a very, very loving, people- oriented dog that would love a family to call her own.  Her adoption fee will be waived for the right home. \n\nPlease complete an online APPLICATION if you wish to adopt.  Forever Home Rescue New England is a 501(c)3  non-profit organization. We are a network of foster homes in the South and the New England area. THERE IS NO SPECIFIC SHELTER LOCATION. If you wish to meet our dogs, you must first be approved by going through our application and screening process. Forever Home Rescue suggests obedience training for all puppies and dogs. All dogs are up to date on their shots, dewormed and spayed or neutered. Vet fees, transport fee and New England quarantine fees ARE INCLUDED in each dog's adoption fee. Also, any dogs older than pups--even if they are not marked housetrained in their posting---usually housetrain within a day or two, because most are used to living outside in the south and will prefer to do their business outdoors. Our dogs and pups are best suited for families with children 5 yrs old and up. If you are approved to adopt, please submit the $100 deposit by clicking on our rescue's name in this posting (Forever Home Rescue New England--in purple) which will bring you to a new page with the deposit link at the bottom.  STOP! If you have not been notified of your approval status do not make a deposit.",

Micah enjoys long walks, spending time with her humans, loves movie night cuddle time, loves car rides, lives to please her human, enjoys playing with toys and is very good motivated. She does okay with other submissive male dogs when properly introduced, but can be selective and it's mainly with female dogs. She's non reactive to cats and will befriend them sooner rather than later.. Micah is 100% crate trained, 100% potty trained & does phenomenal on a leash. We'd recommend no children 10 & under. Although she is great with all people and craves human companionship along with tons of attention, Micah does like her own personal space. She knows all of her basic commands and is just a lover at the end of the day. Did we mention that Micah gives hugs like a human would and that she will smile on command when you say Cheese. \n\nAdoption #Requirements: No Exceptions!\n- Fenced in Yard Required\n- No kids under the age of 10\n- No Female Dogs & would thrive best as the only dog in the home\n\nMicah is currently up for adoption through Lending A Helping Paw Dog Rescue. Her adoption fee is $350 & will include her distemper, rabies, bordetella, parvo, & lepto vaccines; deworming; microchip; heartworm test; fecal test & being fixed. Micah is currently on both flea & tick, as well as heartworm prevention. We kindly ask that you please wait until then to ask any questions.\n\n***PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE POST & FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS****\n \nWith the Covid-19 Pandemic going on we are still doing adoptions, but please remember that we are all volunteers and safety comes first. With our rescue being based in the Metro Detroit area, all prospective adopters must live within the state of Michigan (which means No out of state adoptions). Please remember we are not a shelter and are 100% foster based. Once you submit your application, it may take up to 2 weeks for us to get back to you. So please be patient with us.\n\nAgain, we kindly ask that you please read the entire post to answer your questions. If you cannot follow the instructions properly, we will skip your application and move onto the next one. We kindly ask that you save any questions, comments or concerns for the phone interview. We kindly ask the following: No phone calls, No pm's, & No multiple emails- We are all volunteers and promise to get back to you within a timely fashion! \n \nLending A Helping Paw Dog Rescue; previously known as the PRO-PET-OTIC Foundation, is a 100% Foster-Based Rescue that is ran by all Volunteers. Which means that we are not a shelter & each animal is in an actual home with a foster family. We kindly ask that you put any questions within the email & our team of Volunteers will get back to you. With the overwhelming amount of emails please be patient with our 100% volunteer family and we will get back to you. The application MUST BE filled out, a Vet Check MUST BE completed by our team, as well as a phone interview before we do a 'Meet N Greet.'\n \nHow To Apply:\nIf you're interested in adopting one of our available dogs:\n1. Email LendingaHelpingPaw313@gmail.com with the dogs name as the subject when you ask for the adoption application.\n2. Once you have completed the application, please print it out, fill it out, scan it, & then email it back to LendingAHelpingPaw313@gmail.com. If you do not have a scanner, please take a picture with your phone and we kindly ask that you sent all attachments into one email.\n3. Please make sure to call your vet to grant our organization permission to do a vet check on your current pet.\n4. If you are interested in more than one dog, please list your top 3 choices on the completed application.\n5. Please be honest & truthful on your application. We always do a vet Check.

            "description": "Eric was returned due to behavior issues. He is 11 months old and 30 pounds and looking for a home with no children and a confident owner.  He is housebroken and crate trained. The previous owner said he lived with chickens and has been with a female dog but has not had opportunities to be with many other dogs.  They also said most of the time he was very sweet with the kids and adults in the home but would test both and would nip at the kids at certain times. We had a trainer work with him for awhile and he said that Eric will require an owner who is a strong leader.  Eric can sense a lack of confidence and will use that as an opportunity to fill that leadership vacuum.  He fills that void by claiming space, whether in the kitchen or in his kennel.  Being a strong leader and working with him on his obedience allows him to relax and become the sweet, goofy guy he is.  He just loves to play ball and play with his stuffed toys.

            "description": "Callie's looks are what many of our adopters want. Because of her appearance she's had a huge response but Callie is going to be a harder to place dog. She's complicated. She is VERY shy and VERY shut down! She's been with Marleys Mutts for almost 40 days. This is not due to lack of interest but rather because of our desire to allow her time to decompress and make sure we know as much about her as possible so we can place her in an appropriate home. \n\nCallie will never be what most people want or expect in a dog (which is happy go lucky). She may always be shy, fearful and possibly even standoffish long term. She has not bonded with any of the humans in her foster home but has come out of her shell a tiny bit when outside and with other confident/friendly dogs. Most adopters are not equipped to manage this personality trait. She has never shown any aggression with people just fear. Love and affection will not \"\"fix\"\" Callies issues and if she's pushed too hard with well intentioned affection she will likely regress into her shell even further. \n\nWhat Callie needs is a home that allows her to decompress and adjust at her speed and doesn't push social interaction before she's ready. This process could take weeks, months or in some cases years. Even once she's fully decompressed she may never be a \"\"people friendly \"\" or super social dog. Only time will tell us what kind of personality she'll have once her fear has decreased. We'd really love for Callie to have a quiet home, a patient family and another confident friendly dog as she's more dog oriented and dogs will help pull her out of her shell a bit quicker. Children make her nervous so a child free home would suit her the best. \n\nWe are taking our time with her placement as placing her isn't the #1 priority unless the placement is the right match. She's much too sensitive to be bounced around from home to home if a placement doesn't work out. \n\nI know how eager families are to adopt but with some dogs the process just takes longer. We really want Callie to have that perfect fit. If you feel you can be the patient home Callie needs no matter how long it takes her to open up apply today If you are interested in adopting a Marley's Mutts please fill out an application at http://marleysmutts.org/adoptionprocess/",

He was surrendered to us because his dad is in failing health and Harbor is heartworm positive, but his treatment is completed and is now HW negative.\n\nPlease be ready to commit to Harbor for the remainder of his life as he has been bounced around a bit in his 2 short years of life. He is housebroken, will let you know when he needs to go out to potty, He needs to be in a home that has children and that can provide him a lot of attention and play time, walks and hikes.\n\nHe is up to date on vaccines, is neutered and we need to confirm that he is microchipped, if he is not, we will send you the chip. He gets along with other dogs, we are not sure about other cats.",

Ideal for a family with school-age children or someone who works from home, he will be a fantastic companion for someone who wants a friendly pet with excellent house manners. Joey is smart and works very hard for a good ear rub or back scratch. Joey understands sit and would love to be taught more great tricks! Joey hasn't shown any interest in chewing things and can be trusted around the house. He has moderate separation anxiety so hell need positive reinforcement to be confident when left alone. Joey is medium-energy and walks well on a leash. He loves walking and jogging and also is content to lay quietly near you while you work or watch TV. We think Joey is a lab/Anatolian mix or he may be his own unique mix of doggie. Joey loves other dogs and is not tested with cats. Hes around 2 years old and 60 lbs. Joey is neutered and up to date on vaccines. The \n\nIf you are interested in adopting Joey, please complete an application at https://www.circle2rescue.com/dog-adoption-application/ The adoption fee of $250 includes the spay/neuter, vaccinations, deworming and microchip. \n\nPlease note, Circle 2 Rescue cannot guarantee the breed, composition or ages of our dogs as we usually have no history prior to them entering the rescue.

She takes a little bit of time to warm up but once she does, she is absolutely full of love, kindness and power snuggles. She really enjoys snuggling and being close to people. She has come a long way and really benefits from being with another dog who she feels will love, protect her and show her the ropes of being an independent animal. She really enjoys running outside and has learned to play fetch and retrieve tennis balls by hanging out with her older, foster brothers. Karen is also a very low maintenance dog and really loves to lay in her crate and relax. She also redefines the word couch potato and has become a professional wrestler as her side hustle. Karen is the perfect mix of relaxing and being a couch potato to turning it up with some sprints around the yard, some backyard brawls (wrestling) and chasing the chuck it balls. She is an absolute love and will make a great addition to any home. As she is still skittish, she would really benefit from a fenced in yard as well as being with another dog. She has no issues with cats aside from wanting to play with them.\n\nPlease Note: All dogs are posted until they are officially adopted. This dog may have other interested adopters in line. If you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application on our website at www.lasthopek9.org.\n\nQuestions? Please email adoptions@lasthopek9.org. For more photos, or information on upcoming adoption events where you can meet her, please go to www.lasthopek9.org or go to our Facebook page. Thank you for your interest in saving a life!",

This handsome boy came in under-socialized, and is slowly but surely learning to trust humans and make dog friends! He really starts to open up when he's out on walks, where he gets to move his legs and explore the sights and sounds. He's working on his leash skills, and has come a long way! Hubbard does well in the playgroup and could benefit from a confident, calmer doggy sibling that wouldn't be too rowdy. While he won't give you cuddles on your first meeting, this gentle boy has a lot of love to give to a lucky family who is willing to open their home to a shy pup. We know once he's in a loving home he will finally be able to relax and live as the spoiled boy he deserves to be! Come meet sweet Hubbard today!",

            "description": "Sugar Plum is such a tail-wagging, busy, playful girl. Outdoors, she loves playing in the water and hiking and sniffing in parks. At home, she'll chew her squeaky toys and do zoomies with her dog buddy. Then, for sure, she'll want to cuddle, hug and kiss her people, getting their scratches and head petting in return. And if you stop that head stroking, she'll paw you to start again. This lively, energetic girl is having great fun with her doggie foster buddy, playing for hours, chasing each other, playing tug-o-war and wrestling. Then she'll go for long leash walks, excited to see other dogs and pulling on her harness. Back home, she'll want her playtime - and her frozen peanut butter Kong. Then at night she'll want to snuggle and cuddle in bed with her people. With her cute light snore, she makes a perfect sleep partner. Sugar is also a smart girl who understands 'sit,' 'no' and 'stay,' and she's perfectly house-trained. She isn't a fan of crates, but does fine free-roaming the house when her fosters are away. This sweet, lovable girl hopes to move in with a family. She'd love children and another dog to play with who would give her constant affection - and snacks. Come meet her, she loves everyone right away and will follow you home!",

Hero is adoptable adoption at Del Norte Animal Control, 2650 Washington Blvd, Crescent City, CA 95531.\n\nWe pre-screen adopters interested in the Pit Bull Terrier blends at Del Norte Animal Control, and an adoption application will be required from those interested in providing a fab furever home to Hero.

I'm lean and muscly and love to run around the yard and have fun. I haven't learned any tricks yet, so I'll need basic training and help learning some manners but I know I can do it! I really like playing with stuffy toys but I'm not very good at sharing. I'd prefer to keep them all to myself. I need a home with no cats because they would be too much fun to chase. I'm looking for an active family who can give me the exercise I need to stay happy and healthy. Think you can keep up with me? Come meet me at Woodford Humane or call 859-873-5491 to find out more about me! \n Primary Color: Black Secondary Color: White Weight: 57.8lbs Age: 4yrs 1mths 2wks Animal has been Neutered",

Animal Control finally came and rescued me, though. I'm doing much better now, but I am always going to be a little bit special. When confronted with specific, or strange unpredicted sounds, I don't know how to respond. I get overwhelmed easily- and when I do, I cope by either self-harm by chasing and chewing on my tail or by trying to control the situation that has left me overstimulated. My behaviors are pretty well in line with a compulsive disorder- something that never will be able to be cured. A vet indicated that if my anxiousness gets worse, it may be a good idea to start me on medicine to help gain some control. But I promise I'm one of the sweetest guys you will ever meet! I love to cuddle and play. My favorite game is tug-of-war. And playing games and with toys actually helps me feel better! \n\nI need a mature home. Children would be too unpredictable and noisy for me to relax. I would also do best in a home with other dogs that are as playful as I am- though they need to be tolerant of me socially because I can get my signals crossed sometimes. I'm good with cats. Like going to the dog park. House trained. Crate trained- I just need plenty of time for exercise with an appropriate amount of stimulation. So tell me, what's not to love! If you have any questions, please don't be afraid to ask. While I might have some special needs, I promise I'm a good boy!

            "description": "Name: Ziggy\nNickname: Zigster, Big Z, Pumpkin\nWhat we know he is: Chihuahua\nWhat he thinks he is: 100 lb. German Shepherd\nAge: 3 Years\nWeight: 9 lbs. \nBefore OMD: Found on the streets as an emaciated stray by animal control and did his mandatory hold at the shelter. We saw him, he reminded us of one of our favorite OMD alums, Zig, and we knew he had to be part of our crew.\nEnergy Level: High. He can handle a long hike and still come home and enjoy some play time.\nAffection Level: Higher. Cuddles, snuggles, more cuddles, more snuggles, add in some kisses\u2026you get the picture.\nFood Motivation Level: Highest. He didn\u2019t pack on those much needed pounds magically! This boy can eat!  \nVocal Level: Surprisingly low.\nBest Feature: His \u201cOMG! You\u2019re back!\u201d tail wag and happy dance that happens every time he sees a human -- even if he just saw them.\nClaim to Fame: Lightening fast tail-chaser (his own) extraordinaire.\nHis favorite things: All things soft and fluffy (only families with incredible blanky collections need apply). Laying on his back. Shimmying down the couch through said soft things. Throwing his toys around. \nOur favorite things: He is a lover for sure. He wants love and to be loved. His humans are his happiness. He makes a fantastic work-from-home partner.\nWorking on: Not guarding things he buries in his dog bed. Occasional marking. Jumping. Talking trash to passing dogs.\nDogs: Eh. Maaaaaybe not...unless his family is very savvy with intros. He has lived with dogs in his foster homes but was kiiiiiiind of a jerk for the first few weeks and does not like to share his people. \nCats: Yeah, no problem. May chase from time to time just for fun.\nKiddos: Hard pass. He is not a fan of young ones. To be clear: we will be looking for homes with no children or homes with kids 12+.\nCrate Trained: Sure is! He sleeps in his crate every night.\nHousebroken: Mostly, but still falls back into his occasional marking behaviors. Hey, old habits die hard.\nHome Requirements: Standalone, apartment, condo -- any environment will work as long as he's allowed on the furniture for cuddle time!\nZiggy is neutered, vaccinated, heartworm negative, and microchipped. He is available for adoption to residents of CT and surrounding states. If you are interested in adopting, please complete an application at omdrescue.org",

            "description": "Meet Kiwi! She is a 3 year old French Bulldog / Pitbull Terrier mix, around 50 lbs, spayed, up to date all vaccines and is ready for her furever family. Her name is Kiwi because when she came into rescue (from a high kill shelter), most of her fur was gone and when it started growing back, it looked like kiwi fuzz! \n\nSee, Kiwi is silly most of the time, and is interested in being a couch potato (she would love it if you were too)! She is learning to play fetch and likes to play tug a war in small increments. Kiwi asked me to tell y\u2019all \u2018food & cuddles is life\u2019. If you\u2019re interested in a pretty princess, she is always down for a manicure.\n\nShe loves her humans but is sometimes fickle about other fur friends as she loves to be the center of attention. This is why she would likely be happiest in a home with no other pets. And even if you don\u2019t want to cuddle, Kiwi demands it. Kiwi is looking to be someone\u2019s new best friend who she can trust to love her the right way. She is heartworm positive but has begun treatment and is doing great! Apply to adopt Kiwi and get ready for all the cuddles! \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2020 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq",

            "description": "Sweet Annabella is a mostly furry, extremely loveable couch potato. She has been with her foster mom for the past 6 months recovering from Demodectic mange and getting more beautiful every day. She has been a perfectly polite and trainable dog. She is very food motivated which makes training a breeze. Annabella knows commands like sit, shake, and down. She also gets along great with the cat in the home and a 60 lb male dog, although Annabella will do best as either an only dog or with a submissive male. She has a rough and silly play style and will not do well with small dogs. While she would get along with another submissive male dog in the home it would not be necessary as she loves the companionship of a human above all else. She does great with kids who are a little older, she does not typically jump on anyone but sometimes she doesn't realize how big she is, and in all honesty if she could sit on your lap all day she would. She is not the most athletic dog, but walks great on leash. Annabella is not an adventurous dog and prefers short neighborhood walks as going to new places can be very over-whelming for her. Her short burst of energy and excitement are short lived and she settles down great. She meets new humans in a polite and sweet manner but has not had much experience meeting new dogs. She gets a bath with medicated shampoo about once a week as her skin continues to heal. Annabella is housebroken and crate trained. Annabella would prefer a quite neighborhood over city life.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Annabella, please fill out an application today!",

            "description": "Jamie is handsome, he responds well to commands, has a precision touch to getting squeakers out of toys. He does well with other dogs with a proper introduction. Jamie needs a confident leader when walking on a leash. When you feel confident Jamie feels confident. Jamie takes his cues from his owner! Jamie needs a secure yard, he is able to leap fences in a single bound (he aspires to be the next superman). Jamie is potty trained. He is not good with cats. He is neutered, in good health, and up to date on all his vaccinations. He is approximately 8 years old and 80 pounds and would most likely be more comfortable at 70 to 75 pounds. He loves to go on walks, ride in the car and cuddle with his humans and most importantly be by your side. The perfect home would be someone that walks everyday (even a good run), that is home more than not and will dote on this lovely boy. Jaime is looking for a human who loves dogs and enjoys cuddling him on the couch and the bed. He would do best in a house with a secure fence with humans that are willing to give him the love, attention, and stability he needs. Jaime has done well with other dogs but needs a proper introduction. He loves life - especially dog toys, loving pets, car rides, playing, smelling new things, and receiving gentle pets. He wants to be in a home where he receives positive reinforcement and regular attention. He wants to please and likes to communicate with his humans. He is very loyal and will make you feel safe and protected. He is currently working with trainer and dog behaviorist Karyn Garvin (\nhttps://garvinsdivinedogtraining.com/).\n\n*Applications to adopt: wwwTucsonColdWetNoses.com Home Visit / ID and Residence Verification is required.

He is all wiggles and smiles at the front of his kennel letting you know he can not wait to meet his new family. He is looking to be the only pet so he can be the apple of your eye and soak up all the love and affection you have to offer. He likes his walks and enjoys the feel of the sun on his face. Tobias is quite the love who is looking for your patience while he makes to moves to indoor living. He would love to have a big fenced yard to explore and enjoy the outdoors. He loves kids, is house trained and crate trained and gets a little upset when left alone so will need a family to work on getting him comfortable with your departures. Tobias gets along with other polite female dogs here at the shelter. He is jumping for joy at the thought of having a family to dote on him and give him the love and attention he loves!

He is drawn to calm and low key people which is a lot like his own personality. Also, he is quite the snuggle dog once he bonds and wouldn't mind being next to you on his very own comfy chair or bed. After some well-deserved RandR, he loves to go on walks and spend time going for short drives in the car. He needs to find a person to bond to, so he can enjoy new things and feel secure at the same time. He would be best in a home where he could be with his person a majority of the time, be the only animal, and without young kids. He wants to please and be the best dog for you and with your love and guidance we know he will be! So, make an appointment today and come meet Mijo to see if he is the right boy for you!",

She clearly wasn\u2019t treated well early on but she warms up quickly and becomes a goofy, wiggly cuddle bug. This girl loves to cuddle. She\u2019d lie on top of you if you let her. Daisy wants to please and listens well and learns the rules quickly. She is potty trained and mellow in the house and gets along wonderfully with the other female dog and friends dogs that she has been introduced to. She can be aggressive to dogs outside her home or pack so she will need to be on leash or in a yard at all times. She does have some separation anxiety but does well with bones or toys to chew while you are gone.  She doesn\u2019t know her own strength and wants to play with excited kids and can knock them down so she will be best in a home with no small kids.",

A few days later someone was looking for a nursing mom, as their dog had died after giving birth.  Lexi was such a trooper! She took them in and was nursing 14 puppies!! \nShe is such a nurturing dog period. She\u2019s a lover and will be a great family dog! \n\nAdoption fee includes spaying/neutering, shots, micro-chip and heartworm testing.\nPlease contact foster mom Dinesha at 972-896-6313 or email at adbadoptions@yahoo.com.  To see dogs please download an application from our website, www.adifferentbreed.org and email to foster parents address above. We will arrange a meet and greet. Dogs that have been housebroken may need a refresher course or just learn your new routine.  Maybe they used a doggie door or rang a bell to go out.  Please have patience and give them some time!",

Kapu was originally adopted from us and then recently came back into our care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Kapu came to us with an old injury that was causing him pain. Thanks to our Second Chance Fund, we were able to get Kapu the help he needed to live his best life. He is a gentle, fun-loving soul who adores hanging with humans, and enjoys the company of other dogs. He loves his stuffed toy ''babies'' and will contently curl up with them for a good nap. He thinks car rides are great and if you're extra lucky, he'll nuzzle up and rest his big ole head on your shoulder while you're driving! Kapu has been spending his days with a wonderful foster family who have been teaching him about the finer things in life and now he's ready for a forever family of his own! Kapu loves romping around, playing with toys, and curling up in bed. He's such a love and we simply adore him. Kapu absolutely deserves to know that forever kind of love.",

She originally was given the name Marsha when first arriving to P4P in 2014. Pepper was adopted and loved, but due to unfortunate circumstances, she has found her way back to us. Now 7 years old, Pepper's ready for a new home! A forever home. One that will love her for all that she is! She's still got a zest for life and a love for attention. She is doing very well in her foster home with other dogs, but please no cats for this lady. Pepper loves going for walks, and does so great on a leash. She keeps a very clean kennel. Are you interested in adopting Pepper? Fill out an application today! Her adoption fee is $185, and she is spayed, microchipped and current on all vaccines. Pepper is on a special diet, so her future home will need to understand her food allergies. She in on a strict no-chicken, H/A prescription diet, and it really helps her skin. She gets a bath with medical shampoo twice a week, and will most likely need medication to help with flare-ups every once in a while. The love Pepper has and is waiting to give her forever family is worth it.\n\nAdoption applications are available online at www.partnersforpetsil.org/applications!",

So we thought it would be easier to have fosters/adopters contact the shelter directly so that the shelter director can answer any and all questions. \n\n931-363-2300\n\nKeely's Friends Dog Rescue can still help with the vetting of the dogs. (Spay, shots, heartworm test). \n\nHarley is in need of an Adopter to get her out of a rural animal shelter. She was living tied up outside with another female (Roxy) and a litter of puppies and another male. Volunteers convinced the owners to surrender all of the dogs, except the male.\n\nThey are the sweetest dogs that want nothing more then to snuggle up to a new family. They can be adopted out separately and are not a bonded pair. They are both about 30 pounds each. PPCKET PITTIES! Roxy is 4 years old and Harley is 4.5 years old. And they have the CUTEST underbites!\n\nNeed to be the only dog in the home as they have some resource guarding with food.\n\nWe are asking for a Christmas miracle for these precious pups. Could you open your homes and hearts to one of these babies?\n\nTo schedule a meet n greet please fill out this form https://tinyurl.com/keelysadoptionday",

Sometimes you have to look hard to find her. She is rather quiet and prefers to be held as you go about living life. \n\nDue to her size, medical needs, and the fragility, Midget and her mom are looking for a quiet, adult-only with lots of love and little activity. They should be the only pets in their new home as other dogs would be too much. They have never seen a cat. They would love if their person was always home. \n\nMidget says \"Hi, we would like us to have an adult only home, no other dogs please as we are very quiet and reserved. With my petite size and quiet personality, peace is very important, but so is exercise. We would enjoy a tranquil secure yard to go for little walk-abouts in, but make sure no nasty birds can snatch me. You have to watch over us carefully.

The rescue covers the cost of treatment at the rescue's vet. \n\nI seem to be part pittie, so I need a single family home. I can NOT go to a home in a city or county with pitbull restrictions. \n\nReese is a 4 year old lab mix with we think springer spaniel too. She was picked up by the shelter when someone called in a el chupacabra. She is gaining weight and hair slowly. We use coconut oil everyday and oatmeal shampoo for baths. She is shy when you approach her with the leash but we are working on that, sit and down. She loves to play with our dogs and would probably do well with a doggy friend. She loves to sit next to us and be petted. Reese is fine with my older kids (9 and up) and has been gentle with the babies (2 & 1). She just tends to avoid them because they make her nervous. She hasn't been outside a lot because its too cold so we aren't sure about walks. She sleeps in her crate at night but she likes when someone sleeps in the room with her. She loves ropes, tennis balls and stuffies but doesn't understand fetch. Overall a sweetie who is going to be so pretty and fun once she get better/comfortable.",

We do not have a shelter. We focus on local adoptions in DC and the metro area of Maryland and Virginia. CDR&CK has a thorough adoption process in order to find the best possible fit for each of our dogs and cats (we do not operate under a first-come, first served model).\n\nUpon accepting a new cat or dog into the organization, we provide a basic vet visit that includes necessary vaccinations, disease screenings, deworming, microchips, and spay/neuter (unless specified). We do not provide a comprehensive medical exam prior to adoption. As a result, sickness, injury, and disability may exist unbeknownst to CDR&CK. City Dogs Rescue & City Kitties is not responsible for payment of any vet care, including known and unknown medical conditions once a cat or dog is adopted from us. \nDog specific: Rabies, DHPP, Bordatella vaccines. They are tested for HW, Lyme, Ehrlichia, Anaplasmosis.\n\nMost cats and dogs will have a house training accident in the initial days in their new home and we cannot guarantee any pet is housebroken or crate trained.\n\nWe also update our Facebook page daily with new cats and dogs.",

Barley is the man of your dreams with his large, dreamy eyes, soft coat and polite manners. Did we mention that he's quite the athlete as well? Only if it involves a ball or squeeky toy. He is the full package and then some. It may take some time to truly see his personality flourish, but he'd prefer it that way. His loves takes time and trust is extremely important to him. He's a loyal guy who wants to give his heart to someone who feels the same. Barley would do best in a home without younger children and without other dogs in the home. While he does well with other appropriate dogs after a proper, slow introduction outside the home he would do best in a single dog home. Barley is a highly sensitive guy who needs a home that understands and recognizes fearful behaviors in dogs and will act accordingly as he may act/respond out of fear. \n\nBarley is neutured, microchipped and current on vaccines. \n\nHis adoption fee is $110. \n\nIf you're ready to take a chance on love please email adoptions@hstt.org or call (530) 587-5948 for more information on how you can schedule an appointment to meet Barley!",

The family tried to take care of them, and they found all her puppies a home except one. It started to get cold so he gave us a call and we took Sally and her puppy Tucker in. She is a very sweet loving dog. although she is nervous when she meets you  so it takes a while for her to adjust and warm up to new people. The outside world scares her a little bit, so we have been working with her.  She needs to find a family that understands it will take a little time for her to adjust and know she's safe. She will be spayed, and heartworm tested in a couple of weeks. We are accepting applications on her.  Call 910-259-7022 to meet her.\n",

She is rather quiet and prefers to lay next to her person whether they be reading or watching television. \n\nDue to her age, medical needs, and the fragility of Midget, they are looking for a quiet, adult-only with lots of love and little activity. They should be the only pets in their new home as other dogs would be too much. They have never seen a cat. \n\nToughy says \"Hello, dears. I would like us to have an adult only home, no other dogs please as we are very quiet and reserved. At my age, peace is very important, but so is exercise. We would enjoy a tranquil secure yard to go for little walk-abouts in, but make sure no nasty birds can snatch Midget. You have to watch over us carefully. Perhaps if you have a quiet home that could provide me with steady exercise and my daughter, Midget with security, she is very small, we could have adoption staff set up an interview.\"\n\nIf you have further questions, emails are the only method of communication at this time.

His personality and heart are as big as his home state. This boisterous bundle of energy is looking for active home with sturdy, confident children to love. He is very tidy boy who would prefer to be the king of his castle with no other pets to threaten the throne.\n\nKlondike is big, strong boy who needs a loving, confident family who will give him lots of physical activity and continued training. His potential family should have securely fenced yard with lots of room to run. \n\nKlondike says \"Hello, Washingtonians. It sure does rain a lot here, but I also heard that there are lots of fun places to explore while on leash with my new family. Please understand I don't quite get along with other animals, including fellow canines, at this time due to my sheer size, exuberance, personality, and need for continued positive reinforcement training.\" \n\nPlease see Breed Information Below:\n\n\"Lacys are intelligent, intense, active and alert. Originally created to work feral hogs, the Lacy was developed into an all-around working breed for ranchers, cowboys, hunters and trappers. They have incredible drive and determination. Bold and brave, they excel at herding cattle and hunting wild boar. They are naturally territorial and will protect their property. Though Lacys make excellent companions, they don't do well with passive owners. This breed needs a calm yet assertive leader who establishes clear rules. Lacys also need consistent mental and physical exercise. Due to their intelligence, they can be quickly trained to perform many tasks.\" https://www.dogbreedinfo.com/bluelacy.htm\n\nIf you have further questions, emails are the only method of communication at this time.

            "description": "Wicket is a 10 year old yorkie, who spent his life being used to sire puppies by a backyard breeder. Despite this, he has bonded with his foster mom and with enough patience to get through his shy period, we're confident he'll bond with a new family quickly. He does fine with other dogs but due to his tiny stature and spinal deformity, we will only place him with dogs of similar size. We do not think he'd do well in a home with children.\nWhen he came to us, he was full of health issues and we've done our best to address them. He had to have all of his remaining teeth pulled due to severe dental disease, he has a spinal deformity that makes him have a hunchback, and he has an oronasal fistula that needs surgically repaired by a specialist. He sees a specialist in January and we will be paying for that surgery; however, he can be adopted in the meantime as long as an adopter is willing to take him to Hilliard for the appointment and comply with his post-op care.\nThankfully, he's an all around happy dog and doesn't seem to let all of his issues dampen his spirits! He is just looking for his retirement home, where he can enjoy the finer things in life for whatever time he has left.\nWicket has been neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, and is heartworm negative. His adoption fee is $250 and he's being fostered in the Columbus area.\nIf you are interested in adopting Wicket, please apply on our website, www.prodogsohio.org/adoptables.\nPhoto Credit: Claudine Kosier with Simply Dog Photography\nHe's being fostered in the Columbus area. Please note, we only schedule meet and greets with approved applicants. We are not currently hosting adoption events due to Covid.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWe appreciate your support, in order to help us continue to rescue dogs! Donations can be made via our PayPal account - info@prodogsohio.org.\nYou must be willing to commute to the location that the pet is being fostered in order to be eligible to adopt. We do not ship our pets. We also require that you personally bring the pet back to us should the adoption not work out.\nWe do NOT negotiate adoption fees. All money goes to support our rescue operation. We are 100% volunteered based.\nWe require your current dog(s) to be current on vaccines and heartworm prevention.\nApply online at www.prodogsohio.org, under the Adoptables tab.\nDue to the volume of apps and inquiries, we may not be able to respond to everyone.",

Somehow he wound up as a stray and was taken to an animal shelter, but nobody came to claim him. He was a favorite among the shelter staff and would stand at the front of his kennel wagging his tail and very happy to meet any visitors. Vinny is great with people as well as small and large dogs. Dogs like Vinny are often overlooked at the shelter but he has so much personality that we knew we could find him a lovely retirement home. We found out that Vinny has some calcification in his spine which causes him to walk stiffly. He will be on medication for that. He also had some seizures which are controlled with medication. We are hoping someone with a big heart will adopt  Vinny and give him a home for his golden years.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Vinny please first fill out the online adoption application at www.greatpets.org. Once your application has been received and reviewed you will be contacted to discuss if he is a good fit for your home. Vinny's $150 adoption donation includes his vet examination, neuter surgery, vaccinations, dental cleaning, flea treatment, and microchip.",

She is super friendly and happy but will need a 6 ft fence or more, no chain link... she can climb! She does not like female dogs, but has been fine with male dogs. Huskies are high energy, strong dogs, be sure you are up to it!  Will need exercise or a good size yard to run!\n\nAdoption fee includes spaying/neutering, shots, micro-chip and heartworm testing.\nPlease contact foster mom Dinesha at 972-896-6313 or email at adbadoptions@yahoo.com.  To see dogs please download an application from our website, www.adifferentbreed.org and email to foster parents address above. We will arrange a meet and greet. Dogs that have been housebroken may need a refresher course or just learn your new routine.  Maybe they used a doggie door or rang a bell to go out.  Please have patience and give them some time!",

            "description": "Slinky is a 2 year old 14 pound red dachshund - slight mix in that no bend in her front legs and they are a tiny bit longer than a pure doxie. She is a wonderful pal - a bit shy with strangers, but when she warms up she loves her people. Not yet spayed. She is on wait list at our vets. You can meet 'n greet - she just cannot leave until after her surgery.\nShe is Mom to 7 pups - 4 females; 3 males. Named after Toy Story 4 characters. *All have been adopted. It's just Slinky who's waiting for her home!\nPlease find our applications and valuable information under 'Adopt a dog'* on our website: *www.beaglesandbuddies.com* and email your application to beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Let us know your preference of appointment day/time and which dogs you are interested in and we will do our best to accommodate and email you the closest appointment available. Please allow us up to a week to get back to you. Most appointments will be Friday-Sunday, 10 am - 2 pm, for an hour.\n*Note bring any other dog/s and the entire family to your meet and greet at B&B.* A complimentary training manual is included with each adoption, authored by terristeuben.com. Check out her website - she is fabulous!\nB&B is glad to be open during the pandemic. We know the value and comfort of a loving pet companion and are doing our best to help the dogs and folks who need them. We update our website daily and are always rescuing, vetting, rehabilitating, socializing.\n* We are accepting applications for volunteers to spend time with our dogs, hang out, sing/read to the shy ones, walk/toss ball with those who go to the playgrounds; cleaning, office work, gardening, and building/repair projects! *\n\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment. Please look at our website and make a list of one or more dogs that you would like to see.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf you have a question about adopting, giving up a dog, boarding, or volunteering, please visit the appropriate tabs on our\nhome page.\n\nFor more specific questions, call 626-444-9664 (please leave a voicemail if no answer) or email at beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Note that\nEmailing\nis always preferred!\n\nThanks!\n\nPlease note: If you are viewing this profile anywhere other than Beagles & Buddies own website, you are not receiving full info.
