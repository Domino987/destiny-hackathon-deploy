He is great with other dogs and loves to play with his toys. He is house trained and uses the doggie door. Tank would love a home where he can enjoy the rest of his years and be loved.\n\nTank has a pending vet appointment on Feb 4th to have his teeth checked along with his ears. His nails were extremely overgrown and have been cut which allows him to walk with ease. Tank needs a loving home that will spoil him rotten as he is a mellow ole doggie.\n\nTank's adoption fee is $150 and will include his neuter, vaccines, rabies vaccine and microchip.

He used to walk well on leash but I\u2019ll be honest, with Covid this year and not doing adoption events, none of the dogs have been on leashes in months. However, he\u2019s a smart boy and learns quickly. \n\nCosmo loves to play with the other dogs, play with his toys and chew on bones. He spends his days basking in the sun on the deck, playing chase or entertaining himself on his dog bed. \n\nHis story: he came to use as a tiny pup after he was found standing in the middle of the road and no one ever claimed him. He was adorable and I thought for sure he would get adopted quickly. Nope! He grew up at the kennel house and here we are still looking for a great home. \n\nNeutered, microchip, fully vaccinated, and heartworm negative. Adoption fee is $175\n\n\nApply at Forgottenpaws.com. \nApproved applicant gets a two week trial prior to official adoption. Home visit is required. Masks will be worn.  \n\nLocated just north of Atlanta.",

He does need work when meeting new dogs on walks but sadly I haven\u2019t had time to do what he needs. It\u2019s a simple fix and he is so smart. \nAnyway...look at this handsome man!\n\nHe is 6 yrs old, 55 lbs but doesn\u2019t look it in person. He is housebroken and crate trained but doesn\u2019t need a crate. He loves toys and snuggling. He sleeps on a dog bed at night and prefers to be in your room. When he is sad he makes little tiny dog whiny noises that are so cute. \n\nCarlos is very healthy. From what we have found out, he originally was a stray taken in by Fulton county animal control. He had an injured eye that had to be removed and a gash on his leg.  That was 5 yrs ago. He was adopted and lived w a family for five years until they gave him away on craigslist. The next day, the people who got him brought him to me bc he was NOT GOOD W CATS.  I think this boy is very lucky that no one bad got him when he was given away! \n\nNeutered, fully vaccinated, heartworm negative, and microchipped. Adoption fee is $125.\n Approved applicants get a two week trial prior to official adoption.\n\nApply at Forgotten Paws.com. \n\nLocated just north of Atlanta.",

I love to be held and cuddle to whom I choose as my favorite human. I am not house trained yet, but working on it. My foster mom says I\u2019m making some progress. I love playing with other dogs my size, but cats aren't my favorite playmates. I don\u2019t bark at children, I just run and hide so small children isn\u2019t a good fit for me. Also, not fault of my own, I am very scared of men, I will potty on myself and shake, but I love females. I will also need a fenced in yard because I am very fast and once I start running, well let\u2019s say I love to run. \n\nShe is being fostered in Covington, KY. We can do meets in KY, OH, and IN.\n\nIf interested in adopting, please go to littlehillsofkentucky.org and submit your application.",

No one has given him a chance\n\nCrate trained, housebroken, walks well on leash: he just needs someone to love him.  He can be a silly boy full of love, hugs and kisses.\n\nHoward has never had a normal home. He lived on a chain for the first year and a half of his life. He was able to run free at the kennel house for the first six months but then started having issues with a few of the other dominant male pitbull\u2019s. Since then, Howard spends his evenings in a crate inside but goes out to his own yard to spend the day. He has playmates that go out to play with him but they have to have certain personalities. He loves goofy dogs and it doesn\u2019t seem to matter if they\u2019re male or female. Good with kids but a little exuberant for small ones. He has a very happy bouncy butt. No Cats \n\nPlease consider opening your heart and home to this beautiful boy. He\u2019s had a very bad life and has scars to show it. He deserves a good indoor, loving home and soft bed\n\nNo adoption fee. It has been sponsored by a supporter! \n\nNeutered, microchip, fully vaccinated, and heartworm negative. \nApply at Forgottenpaws.com",

She got him from an ex-boyfriend who couldn\u2019t keep him anymore but he needs lots of playtime and exercise so instead of walking him to burn off his energy, she shoved him in the shed. Out of sight out of mind! \n\nBefore this, Leroy lived in a home. He slept on the bed, cuddled on the couch, and was loved. He longs for that life again. \n3 yrs old, 60 lbs, pit mix.  \n\n-pulls on leash but settles down after the  initial excitement wears off.  \n-TALL FENCED YARD needed \n-loves to play fetch, sits, lays down, comes and gives kisses on command. \nHousebroken\ncrate trained\ngood with MOST other dogs.  He has had issues with larger dominant male dogs, and isn\u2019t good w unneutered males. However, he has never had any issues at all with 99% of the dogs at the kennel house and never a female or small dog.  No cats. \nLeroy is good with older kids. He is good with them all but he still wants to jump when excited and although we have worked on this, he is still too much energy for small kids. \n\nPlease consider FOSTERING OR ADOPTING THIS VERY SWEET HANDSOME BOY! \n\nNeutered, microchipped, fully vaccinated, heartworm negative.  Adoption fee is $150 so we can save the next one. \n\nApply at Forgottenpaws.com\n\nApproved homes get a two week trial prior to official adoption to make sure everyone is a good fit! \n\nLocated just north of Atlanta.",

            "description": "The best thing about Hank is that he loves to give me kisses and when he wants to play he comes and looks for me and starts crying. He is also so quiet that sometimes you even forget he is there.\n\nHis favorite food, mmmm. he eats and likes his dry dog food but once in a while he loves some pieces of chicken breast or ground beef mixed with it. He likes his mozzarella string cheese in the mornings and his chicken treats in the afternoon. He also enjoys his beef knee cap bones.\n\nHis favorite place to sleep I would say is his bed in the kitchen. We've tried several times to take him upstairs to the room but he is afraid and he comes down right away.\n\nHis quirkiest habit he has is to rub himself on the walls, bushes, and cars, lol. He also likes to crawl in the grass, he looks like a soldier at war.\n\nHis favorite toys are a stuffed chicken, porcupine, and a dog rope to pull.\n\nHe loves to go for a walk at night, that's his favorite part of the day.\nAdoption fee includes DHPP vaccine, Rabies vaccine (if age appropriate) heartworm testing, spay/neuter surgery, deworming, wellness vet visit, one month of pet insurance and microchip. All animals are examined by a veterinarian.",

            "description": "Female - 7 years - 60 lbs - Microchipped - Spayed - TXHi! I'm Maybell. I am a 7-year-old, 60 lb spayed female. I am already housebroken and can be trusted home alone while loose in the house. While I will do well being crated overnight while my foster family is home, I do not like being crated while my family leaves the house. My foster family doesn't crate me at all anymore.\nI am friendly with men and women after a few minutes to warm up to them. I cannot go to a home with children. I am more independent and enjoy sleeping off on my own, although I will occasionally seek out affection from my family. I am always happy to receive attention and petting from my family! I will welcome visitors into our home, although a lot of activity can make me anxious so a quieter home would be ideal.\nI am friendly with other dogs and would do well with siblings or by myself. I love my toys and I still have a few favorites I am learning to share with my foster siblings! I am beginning to enjoy engaging play with my foster family! I cannot go to a home with cats.\nI am a quiet, low energy girl, who has almost mastered my leash skills. I enjoy going out for my walks. I am prone to developing small benign masses which typically don't require medical intervention, although they may need to be removed if they grow in an uncomfortable location.\nI am a happy, sweet girl who is ready to find that perfect forever family. Are you my perfect forever family?\nFollow me on Facebook: #EchoDogMaybell\nFor more information, please contact adoptions@echodogs.org.\n\nEcho Dogs fosters dogs in many states. Visit www.echodogs.org/available-dogs to see more of our dogs. Transportation for the adopted dog IS available. Remember, we are an all-volunteer foster rescue organization - we DO NOT have a physical shelter to visit. Our minimum adoption donation is $300. All dogs are spayed/neutered, up-to-date on vaccinations and micro-chipped. Puppies under 6 months old may not be spayed/neutered. This would be the responsibility of the adopter at their own expense. Proof of spay/neuter will be required!\nTo review our adoption procedure and submit an online application, visit: www.echodogs.org/procedure",

Our phone number is 618-665-3005. The shelter is open to the public 1-3 Monday-Saturday. Sundays we are open 1-4 to the public. If those times don't work, please call to set up a time to visit.\n\nThe typical adoption fee for dogs is $150. It includes vaccination, deworming , spay/neuter, heartworm testing on dogs of age and microchipping, which is now mandatory by state law. Some dogs we discount to as little as $50 due to sponsorship. Some dogs we ask a higher adoption fee, which helps us recoup expenses on heartworm treatment on other dogs.\n\nAll cats are spayed/neutered/vaccinated/flea treated/dewormed and microchipped prior to adoption. Cat adoption fees range from $60-$100. We spay/neuter/microchip/vaccinate and deworm all kittens and cats, prior to adoption. Our shyer/less adoptable cats are classed as \"barn cats\" and are free with a completed/approved barn cat application, which can be found on our website.\n\nFor updates on adoption events and more pics of pets available, go to our website, www.claycountyshelter.com or look for us on Facebook.",

He is very loyal and great with people he knows, but will growl at strangers until he is allowed to get to know them.  He is a smart boy and is housebroken.  He doesn't do well with little kids so a home with kids over 10 would be best.   He will most likely chase cats.  He has done ok when meeting dogs at the shelter but a previous owner said he didn't care for other dogs so a meet and greet is required if you have another dog.  \n\nJasper is current on shots, licensed and microchipped. All dogs over 6 months have been heartworm tested, and all dogs are treated monthly for fleas/ticks (Nexgard or Frontline Gold) and are on Heartworm prevention (Heartgard Plus). All pets are spayed/neutered prior to adoption. All our dogs are temperament tested and \"should\" like dogs, cats, and kids unless noted. WE HAVE MORE PETS IN THE SHELTER THAT ARE NOT ON PETFINDER. Call with the pet's name and ID if you have questions on this pet. Save time, print out and bring our Pre-Adoption Form.",

            "description": "Sawyer is a beautiful brindle boy who is a very playful addition to your household! He has a lot of energy and enjoys a hiking and walking companion. He loves to play and run around with other dogs! He is great with people and loves kids but he would be best with older kids because he does tend to get overly excited and jump. He is crate-trained and loves to be inside the house hanging with his family as well. He does need to learn basic leash manners. He is an escape artist so the fencing needs to be high and secure. Please give this fun loving boy the chance to hang with you!\n\nIf interested in adopting Sawyer, kindly fill out the application found here:  \n\nhttps://www.ozzieandfriendsrescue.org/adoptions\n\nIn filling out this adoption application, I understand that Ozzie and Friends Rescue cannot guarantee that the dog applied for is yours to adopt upon completion of application. \n\nWe also want to disclaim that all dogs are rescued so we cannot 100% know the exact breed.",

I'm named for her because I arrived at Lucies with buns in the oven.....get it, \"buns in the oven\"?  Hahahaha\n\nAnyhoo, when I arrived I was heartworm positive.  Thank goodness I made it here because these peeps here are the best caretakers ever!!  I'm good and ready to go!\n\nSo, apparently I suffer from allergies.  We think it is a chicken allergy, although we are not certain.  I'm currently taking allergy medication and Benadryl.  They have considered getting me an allergy test, but I would have to be off all of my other medications first for several weeks, and that just leaves me completely miserable.\n\nThe gals here think I am absolutely the BEST dog!  I love everyone, humans, human kids and dogs.  I never meet a stranger.  I'm crate and leash trained.  Oh yeah, I LOVE water!!\n\nIronically, I could really benefit from a family that enjoys cooking (Rachel Ray) ;)  Through the process of elimination, they think I could overcome my allergies in a more pleasant way.\n\nSo what do you think?  I just know you would love me and I would love you too!  Inquire about me, you won't regret it!!\n\n*** We strive to ensure our dogs are going to a safe, loving and caring home.

I am still young, so I will need to be crated when left home alone. My crate offers me a safe space when I get frightened.\nI am very skittish with new people, although I will warm up to both men and women in my family. Young kids are too much for me, so please no small kids in my home. Older kids who are quieter and respectful of my space are ok with me. With my family at home, I am very affectionate and will seek affection. I am very Velcro to my foster dad! I am reactive to visitors to my home and will not be friendly. My foster family is working with a trainer to help me improve, but it will continue to be a work in progress in my forever home.\nI do well with other dogs and enjoy playing with my foster sister! Due to my fear issues, I will require a confident canine sibling in my forever home to help guide me to knowing it is okay. I have been around cats and have been way too rough with them and would likely injure a cat, so I cannot go to a home with cats. I like playing with my toys, especially squeaky toys!\nMy foster parents have been working with me to learn how to sit, down, stay, place, and walk on a leash. I am still very scared about leaving my home, so I am only working on neighborhood walks first for now. I am intelligent, food motivated, and eager to please my family-so I should do well with continued training and socialization with my forever family! Could that be with you?\nFollow me on Facebook: #EchoDogTurbo\nFor more information, please contact adoptions@echodogs.org.\n\nEcho Dogs fosters dogs in many states. Visit www.echodogs.org/available-dogs to see more of our dogs. Transportation for the adopted dog IS available. Remember, we are an all-volunteer foster rescue organization - we DO NOT have a physical shelter to visit. Our minimum adoption donation is $300. All dogs are spayed/neutered, up-to-date on vaccinations and micro-chipped. Puppies under 6 months old may not be spayed/neutered. This would be the responsibility of the adopter at their own expense. Proof of spay/neuter will be required!\nTo review our adoption procedure and submit an online application, visit: www.echodogs.org/procedure",

She shares his spitfire personality!  She is a little more shy warming up to people and does not love being alone for long periods. She will let you know by squealing until she gets some love! She just wants to be with her people. She loves playing with all toys and bones.  She is very smart and she has figured out how to use potty pads indoors remarkably fast! She loves playing with her siblings and will do best in a home with another young to young adult dog to play with. (No seniors, she is just too much).  She will need a home with a secured fenced in yard (no electric fences), local to St. Louis area only and any children in the home should be over 10 years old. She will be ready to go to her new home mid February.  Taking applications now at actnowrescue.net or you can email her foster mom with any questions at shannonkreader@gmail.com\n",

Bandit is the only boy from his litter and is a real wild man! He has no fear and loves to be rowdy! He loves people and does not like to be alone for long periods of time.  He loves playing with his siblings and will do best in a home with another young to young adult dog to play with. (No seniors, he is just too much). He is very smart and has already learned how to use potty pads indoors very well! When he is sleepy he loves to find a lap to cuddle up on. He loves all toys and bones! He will need a home with a secured fenced in yard (no electric fences), local to St. Louis area only and any children in the home should be over 10 years old.  He will be ready to go to his new home mid February. Taking applications now at actnowrescue.net or you can email his foster mom with any questions at shannonkreader@gmail.com",

Despite her sad and lonely past Mabel is full of love and life. She wants nothing more then to snuggle up and be pet by every person she sees while out for walks! Mabel has the cutest \"happy ears\" and is very polite when greeting people, she calmly sits at their feet for pets! She enjoys getting out for walks and lays calmly in her crate to rest. Right now Mabel does not seem to enjoy being around other dogs but this could change as she settles in and gets used to her environment, right now we're looking for a home as an only dog where she can get all the love! Please consider adopting Mabel! \n\n\nWe think she is around 4 yrs old, \nApply at: http://caninehumane.org/adoption-application/\n\nAdoption Fee is $350\nShe is up to date on vaccines and has had a wellness exam, heartworm tested and micro-chipped.\n\nApplications are required before meeting a dog. To fill out an application go to\n http://caninehumane.org/adoption-application/ \n\nIF THE DOG IS ON PETFINDER IT IS STILL AVAILABLE\n\nwww.caninehumane.org\n\n***BE SURE TO CHECK YOUR SPAM/PROMOTION EMAIL FOLDER FOR CHN RESPONSE TO YOUR APPLICATION***",

I'll even play with them by myself if you're busy working from home! It's true that I'm extremely loveable, but I'm pretty special too. I am reactive on walks, and I'm a big boy! I hope my new human will be able to handle my bossy behaviors and train me to be the good dog I know I can be! If that's you - let's meet! I'm full grown at ~115 lbs. Cats/Dogs? I cannot live with other animals - I'll need to be your one and only. Children? Unknown. Housetrained? Signs point to yes! Training needs? I will do best with an experienced dog-owner who can continue my training. I've been working on wearing my muzzle to help me behave myself on walks. Energy level? Medium. How did I get here? Transferred from another shelter when I came in as a stray. Something extra? My portrait was created by an animal advocate who believes that I'll make a great pet! ~My adoption fee is $95.00.~",

            "description": "Jolly is a 1 year old male German Shepherd mix. He weighs 73 lbs. We will consider adopters for Jolly only if they have Shepherd or similar breed experience. He is doing great working on obedience and leash skills at our adoption center. Jolly is a friendly boy but has lacked structure in his early development so he needs a firm and fair leader to bring him to his full potential. \n\nJolly is happy to meet everyone and has an overall happy personality .He acts like a big puppy and is learning to be more aware of his body and size. Jolly is mouthy with treats but takes correction well and is being much more gentle with work on this. For this reason and his size, we recommend mature \nchildren in his household. 13+ year old kids, dog savvy kids \n\nHe is strong on the leash but has been working well in a Halti during training. Jolly is comfortable being petted all over. He is high energy and needs a lot of exercise - active adopters needed. Jolly can be \"too much\" for many dogs so it would need to be the right match. He was loose and comfortable in our large fenced area at our FL rescue and was not a problem with other dogs.\n\nNot cat tested. Positive toy drive and lots of food drive. Wants to please and learn.\n\nWant to Adopt? 1) Fill out an application on theluckypuppy.org The donation fees are minimum $475 for puppies up to 6 months, minimum $400 for dogs 7 months to 6 years and minimum $ 300 for 7+ years/Special Needs. 2) Once your application is in, our adoption coordinator will contact you and complete a vet check and home visit (possibly electronic). 3) Once approved, please schedule a meet and greet to see the dogs. Meet and greets are by appointment only for approved adopters.\n\nJolly is available in NY through the Go North Program of The Lucky Puppy Rescue centered in Bonifay and Panama City, FL (NY Lic #1054). The minimum donation $400 adoption fee includes transportation from FL to NY, spay/neuter surgery, vaccinations, de-worm, flea prevention, heartworm prevention and martingale safety collar. Adoption fee payment methods accepted are credit, debit, Paypal and bank checks. No personal checks or cash. Applications must be submitted through our website - theluckypuppy.org - thank you! You may copy and paste the following link to apply: http://www.theluckypuppy.org/adoption-application/\n",

            "description": "Luna is a gentle hearted 6 to 8 year old Giant Schnauzer. She is a bundle of energy, is housetrained, leash trained and knows all of her basic commands including come, sit, stay, wait, and go to your bed. She really likes to go far car rides and is comfortable travelling. She loves the attention of her family so much that she has some separation anxiety and does not like to be alone for long. She loves to be outside, especially in cooler weather and benefits from long walks and lots of play time. She plays well with other dogs close to her size, but seems to regard small dogs as toys and is not able to treat them gently which can result in them being injured.\n\nWhile Luna is not aggressive with the people in her household, she can be timid of strangers who come into her territory and has barks and sometimes lunges at them. She is always introduced to new people carefully. Despite this, when taken to the groomers or the vet, Luna has always acted friendly and in an appropriate manner, comfortable to be treated or groomed without complaint. She also generally reacts well to people she meets on walks.\n\nLuna has a pronounced startle response that can be unpredictable. Because of this and her inexperience with small children, Luna would probably be best in a home with no children or older teens. She has a cyst on her back near her hindquarters that has been biopsied and is benign. It has not grown in sized in a couple of years and is considered no danger to her, but is quite noticeable when she has her short summer hair cut. She is also prone to raised hair follicles that go away on their own. They do not bother her and only need to be watched to make sure they don't get infected. She takes Stilbestrol every five days for minor bladder leakage often seen in spayed dogs. She has shown no side effects.\n\nShe has been living in a rural home and property and enjoys the space; she would not do well as a city dog. Luna is not a good choice for first time dog owners; she requires a house with securely fenced yard and in the suburbs or in the country. Her family is sorry that they have to re-home her but she is too rough with the small dogs who are getting older and they are nervous she may hurt one of them.",

            "description": "Meet Brindle beauty Roxie! This 43 pound, 1-year- old girl has been a charmer in her foster home. She has a very sweet nature (even the trainers she\u2019s worked with have said so!)\u2014she\u2019s affectionate with her people and loves to snuggle. She\u2019s excellent indoors\u2014she\u2019s house trained, happy hanging out in her crate and playing with her toys, doesn't chew stuff, and isn\u2019t barky. She\u2019s very content sleeping in her crate at night, and she\u2019s working on spending time there when her humans are out of the house too. She has been working with her foster parents on walking nicely and has made huge progress. She\u2019ll now walk at your side and while she can be reactive to some dogs, she\u2019s getting better at minding her own business. \nRoxie is very food-motivated and takes well to positive reinforcement and treats.  She\u2019s great at learning commands and responds well to verbal and visual cues, and will thrive with an owner who will keep working on her obedience training. Roxie would probably do best as the only dog in the home, and would love to either have a backyard she can run around in, or an active owner who enjoys jogging or other outdoor activity. Roxie will thrive in a home as the only dog with an experienced handler and no young children. \n\nwww.rescuecity.nyc/adopt. \n\nWe are currently facilitating safe adoptions with COVID-19 protocols and adopt out to NYC and surrounding states only - NY CT PA & NJ. \n\n**If a dog is listed on petfinder as available then we are still accepting applications for that dog. We urge you to apply as soon as possible to be considered to adopt the dog you\u2019re interested **\n\nThank you for wanting to give one of our adoptables a loving home! Please follow us on Instagram at @rescuecity for more adoptable updates!\n",

I have to admit I was a hot mess when I got here with matted fur & 4/4 dental disease as well as a horrible UTI. It took the ladies here quite some time to get me back to health but I think I'm ready now to find my new home. I have VERY limited vision & hearing and I had to have 12 teeth removed during my dental. I do still sometimes pee in the floor (no matter how much you take me out) & that will probably never change so I will need a understanding owner who doesn't mind cleaning up after me. Because of my tiny size I will NOT be able to go to a home with small children because they might hurt me by accident. I am UTD on all my shots, heartworm negative, microchipped, newly groomed & have had a dental. I walk well on a leash but prefer to be carried. I am housebroken but have some accidents.Steps for adoption:Fill out application at www.lostfantasystables.orgReference checkHome visit via Zoom (or similar platform)Meet & Greet",

Benny, despite his perfect smile, could use better manners when it comes to taking treats. He was found as a stray. This old dog knows tricks too! He knows sit and paw! We don't know how he feels about children or other dogs, so both will require a supervised visit with staff prior to adoption. If placed with cats, we ask for a very slow, well-managed introduction. If Benny is the sweet, golden guy you've been searching for, please apply to meet him!",

He was diagnosed with leptospirosis which is a bacterial infection that can attack the liver and kidneys. In Jo Jo's case, he has recovered from the infection great; however, he was left with very mild residual elevations in his kidney values. He is not showing any signs of kidney disease; however, it is important to note that this infection did compromise his kidneys, therefore he may be more prone to kidney disease in his future. We do have him on a kidney diet just as a precaution. Other dogs and children are unknown and will require a supervised visit with staff.

Vader is friendly and affectionate, but he needs a family that will be able to provide structure, training (especially on leash etiquette), and a daily routine. He is attentive and food-motivated, which will be helpful with training and enrichment activities. We don't know how he feels about children or other dogs, so both will require a supervised visit with staff prior to adoption. We do not know how Vader feels about cats, so if placed with any, we ask for a very slow, well-managed introduction. If Vader is the speckled cutie you've been searching for, please apply to meet him!",

This beautiful girl is just about perfect! \n\nLilly is house trained and crate trained and working on learning her basic commands. She walks well on a leash too. However she does have a strong prey drive so she will whine and want to chase cats and other small critters that cross her path. She is easily corrected. \n\nLilly loves kids! She warms up quicker to women and will eventually warm up to men. She has zero aggression when meeting new people or dogs. She gets along with other dogs as well but does need a proper introduction. \n\nLilly is calm and over all pretty low energy. She does get playful but never over the top. She is an independent dog but does prefer to eat with her humans instead of separately.",

But it sure does not slow me down. I love to play with my 4 legged foster brothers and sister. I love all dogs and every person I meet. I love snuggling and really like to play with my ball. I am recovering from having something my mom says is called blastomycosis. I see the doctor again in a few weeks. I will need to continue taking my medicine until doctor gives all clear. I would love to find a forever family to call my own. I would like a yard to play in because I like to zoom! I know if you meet me you would fall in love. I am also house and crate trained.\n\nI am being fostered in Hamilton, OH. We can do meets in KY, IN, and OH.\n\nIf interested in adopting, please go to littlehillsofkentucky.org and submit an application.",

            "description": "Foxy is a year and a half years old mixed breed dog.  She came to us heartworm positive and pregnant, had babies here and now she's had heartworm treatment and is ready for her forever home.  She is a very sweet girl but is high energy.  She is only about 35 pounds. She loves to run so a fenced in yard is a MUST! She also does not like cats so needs a home with NO cats.  She loves other dogs.\n\nAdopters must live within a 100-mile radius of Joliet, IL to be considered. The adoption fee is $425. This covers all shots, spay/neutering and microchip.\n\nTo be considered for this dog. Please fill out an application here: https://www.pawsup4rescue.org/dog-cat-applicaiton\n\nOur adoption process typically takes from one to two weeks. When you find an animal you are interested in, we ask that you fill out an application as a first step so we can determine if your family is a good fit for the animal. If you are, then we will contact you to arrange a time for you and your family to meet the animal so you can decide if it is a good fit. If you currently have dogs, we require that the dogs be present at the meeting to make sure it's a good fit all around. Once compatibility is determined, we move on to the paperwork and finalizing the adoption. \n\nIf the meet is not a good fit, we will keep your application on file for up to 1 year and we will gladly consider your family for another dog. \n\nFollow us on FACEBOOK: www.Facebook.com/PawsUp4Rescue/ \nand on INSTAGRAM: www.Instagram.com/Paws_Up_4_Rescue/",

I want him to find his happy tail and stop being overlooked for his imperfections that won\u2019t be forever. Bandit came in with flea dermatitis and is still growing his coat back on his back, yes  he\u2019s missing fur and yes he\u2019s not a puppy but he is so loving and laid back. He would be perfect for a senior who just wants a couch potatoe and has nothing but the rest of their lives to share together. \n\nHe is deaf and blind but that doesn\u2019t slow him down. He maneuvers through the house with ease through vibration and smell. He knows me and exactly where I am. He\u2019s my shadow ??\n\nHe does have accidents, and he prefers low level pets who don\u2019t jump on him. Children over 12 and cat and dog friendly \n\nBandit is a shih tzu. His adoption fee of $250 includes:\n-yearly dh2pp\n-rabies\n-bortadella \n-microchip\n-neuter\n-full dental with extractions\n-wormed and parasite treated \n-flea and tick prevention current\n-heartworm prevention current\n-heartworm negative status \n\nPlease follow the link to his application: \nhttps://form.jotform.com/201418465695159",

            "description": "Calling all *experienced* beagle lovers! Lincoln is a 4.5 year old beagle who was surrendered to our shelter due to his aggression around human food.  They also mentioned that he is easily startled when sleeping and can be reactive.  These issues were never properly addressed when he was a puppy.  It has gotten to the point where this issue will need to be carefully managed in his new home.  Lincoln loves his human friends and really enjoys meeting new people and receiving affection.  Lincoln can be dog-selective and his previous owner said that he was scared of overly excited dogs.  He is a happy go lucky guy but he definitely does have his quirks! Lincoln does fine around dog food and treats, so we believe that his issue lies strictly with high valued human food.  He will need to be kept away when people are eating and will need strict boundaries implemented to help with his lack of impulse control.  He is already crate trained, so this could be a good tool to use.  Lincoln loves to be outside with his favorite volunteers and enjoys his daily walks! He would be a great working dog and would be happy to be your adventure buddy out in the woods.  He will need an adult-only home with no children that visit.  If you have any questions about him, please send an email and we can discuss his behavior further.",

My family took her in at the beginning of the pandemic as her 1st home was not working out. Due to where Keva was born, she doesn't do well with children and her 1st home needed to find her a new environment quickly. Keva does not have a problem when on leash and passing children, she just does better in a home without small humans running around. Keva is shy and was initially fearful of us, but warmed up within the week and now she is one of the most loyal and lovely companions. She is about 1.5-2 years old, so she has some puppy spring in her still - we get her exercise by playing fetch a lot and she LOVES it. Keva's favorite things include car rides, playing with other energetic dogs, HIKING, and chewing on toys at home. Our need to re-home her is due to our dog of 6 years who we have found does not do well with Keva (not Keva's fault). Additionally, Keva is fearful of strangers at first (she prefers to hang out in her crate when people come over) and we feel a home with less foot traffic and traveling would be better for her. Please reach out to me to learn more about Keva and to discuss if you may be the right fit - We want her next home to be her forever place. Extra thoughts: Keva needs a crate - We call this her \"house\" and she goes there to have a safe space when she's overwhelmed - Keva has some \"confinement\" anxiety. This meaning that she does best when left to roam in the *dog proofed* house when people aren't home - Keva needs a home that can give her plenty of consistent exercise. Keva has not lived with cats and we assume she may do better in a home without cats.",

Before you ask, yes I do have a pal named Pancho.  ;)  Here's our story.\n\nSo, here I was presumably dumped in the middle of Nowhere, Texas, when a nice gentleman saw me and picked me up.  He was driving along wondering where he could find a place to keep me, as he didn't have any available space.\n\nA few miles down the road appeared another dumped puppy, who was of no relation to me.  What are the odds?  2 dumped puppies and one nice, caring man to pick us up and save us.  He took us in and cleaned us up and fed us, but it was really putting him in a bind.\n\nHe called those wonderful people at Lucies and they agreed to take us.  They really are cool people, if I do say so myself!  \n\nNow. I am all vetted and healthy.  I'm ready for a furever family.  One that won't mistreat me and dump me.  One that will give me the affection and I that I crave.  I'm so hoping it's you.\n\n*** We strive to ensure our dogs are going to a safe, loving and caring home.

Are you looking for a new BFF that is fully house trained and loves to cuddle....Rosie is ready!\n\nShe is about 3 years old, Crate trained and good with kids!\n\n\nADOPTION PROCESS\n1. Review our adoption contract and application.\n\n2. Call your vet and references to inform them that a rescue representative will be calling.\n\n3. Complete adoption application and submit at  https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/HRMD/Dog\n\n4. You will be notified of outcome of your application within 3-5 days.\n\n5. If approved, you will be introduced to the foster to schedule a meeting within 5 days. Guidelines for the meeting are:\n\n- Bring a leash and collar and be prepared to take the animal home directly from the meeting.\n\n- Meeting should be no longer than 1 hour. Our fosters are volunteers and we value and respect their time and personal commitments. \n\n- All members of the household (including other dogs) must be present.\n\n- Please be prepared to submit adoption fee via PayPal at the meeting \u2013 We do not accept payments prior to the meeting. \n\n- If all goes well, the dog will go home with you directly after the meeting. If you are not ready to adopt at the conclusion of the meeting, please understand that we may process other applications for the dog. Because we have a limited amount of foster homes, we cannot hold dogs past adoption. \n\n6. Please review these resources prior to the meeting to be prepared with what to expect when bringing a new dog home: \n\na. ttps://www.petfinder.com/dogs/bringing-a-dog-home/tips-for-first-30-days-dog/\n\nb. https://www.dogstardaily.com/free-downloads\n\n7.

She was a little underweight in need of a good bath and was infested with fleas!!!\nReese is a quiet gal that likes naps and is very sweet, but do not let that fool you! She is quite goofy and loves to play with stuffed toys in our play yards.\nShe has done well with the dogs she has met and had little interest in the cats in our catroom!\nReese has been spayed, microchipped and is current on all vaccines including rabies. She has been given a dewormer and started on flea/tick prevention, heartworm tested (NEGATIVE) and given heartworm prevention. \n\nIf interested in learning more about Reese please email the Shelter Director @ gjenkins@orangecountyva.gov\nhttp://www.orangecountyva.gov/DocumentCenter/View/361/Pre-Adoption-Application?bidId=\n\n",

Diglet is excited to think that soon, he will have his very own family and home! This fella came to the Shelter lost from his people, and sadly a reunion did not take place. Diglet is a young boy who is exuberant about life and meeting people. He is learning boundaries and spacial awareness! He is making great strides learning to walk on a leash. Diglet has a ton of potential to be a successful new friend! He would appreciate a strong owner, willing to continue to work with him!\n\nUpdate: Shelter staff have discovered that Diglet is an EXPERT 'fetch' player! He really enjoys this game, is gentle when returning the ball and waits, excitedly for the next throw!\n\nThe following descriptions describe behaviors that were observed during testing and/or veterinary examination: Evaluated for temperament with 336619 (male), and 336510 (female). Did well with both. \n\nThe above behaviors and personality traits have been observed while at the Shelter. If this animal was relinquished, information is gathered from the owner regarding behavior. Our wonderful volunteers spend time with these animals and give input on behaviors and traits. However, this description may not be all inclusive to how this animal will act in a loving forever home. Introduction to established family pets should be slow and monitored always. The same goes for children and other family members. Adopting a pet is a big decision and should be thoughtful. We suggest researching different breeds to match traits and personalities to your lifestyle. When adopting a pet, please know that this pet will be with you for their lifetime; patience and consistency will make for a successful adoption.\n\n**Age is estimated** \n\nSELECTIVE ADOPTION ONLY!\n\n Primary Color: Tan Secondary Color: White Weight: 65.8lbs Age: 0yrs 9mths 1wks Animal has been Neutered",

No worries, Barry. You are in a good place where you will get all the love and attention you want. Barry has some basics to learn, like housebreaking. However, he is reported to be good with people, dogs and cats. That's a great start! Barry was heartworm positive when he arrived, so he will be getting the treatment he needs. During that time, he can go home with his future family and bond with them, then finalize adoption upon completion of treatment. What an awesome program! Email humanesociety@hsscg.org to meet Barry yourself. He is neutered, microchipped and current on vaccines. Let's take that worried look off his face and replace it with a big smile.",

It's actually a nickname for Francisco.  Cool huh?  Oh and yes, I do have a pal named Lefty ;)  Here's our story.\n\nSo, here I was presumably dumped in the middle of Nowhere, Texas, when a nice gentleman saw me and picked me up.  He was driving along wondering where he could find a place to keep me, as he didn't have any available space.\n\nA few miles down the road appeared another dumped puppy, who was of no relation to me.  What are the odds?  2 dumped puppies and one nice, caring man to pick us up and save us.  He took us in and cleaned us up and fed us, but it was really putting him in a bind.\n\nHe called those wonderful people at Lucies and they agreed to take us.  They really are cool people, if I do say so myself!  They call me their little timber wolf.  Howwwwllll!!!  ;)\n\nNow. I am all vetted and healthy.  I'm ready for a furever family.  One that won't mistreat me and dump me.  One that will give me the affection and I that I crave.  I'm so hoping it's you.\n\n*** We strive to ensure our dogs are going to a safe, loving and caring home. Phone interviews are required for all adoptions****",

She does look like a puppy- most likely due to malnutrition, her growth was stunted.  Even though humans let her down in the past, she holds no grudges.  Ellie loves everyone that she meets and can\u2019t get enough love.  She will jump right into your lap craving more attention because simply petting her is not enough! Ellie can be reactive with dogs an it seems she is more likely to befriend a male dog than a female dog.  This youngster is super energetic and would benefit from an active family to keep her mind and body busy.  Ellie weighs only 42lbs and could possibly make a good apartment dog, as long as she gets the proper amount of outdoor exercise time! Older teens or adult-only home preferred, since she can sometimes be a little intense with her food.",

My ideal home would be a calm/quiet environment with people who understand it will take me time to warm up and come out of my shell. I love other dogs and am even good with cats! I am unknown with small children but because of how timid I am, I would probably do best in a home without children. I need a house with a fenced yard and cannot go to an apartment due to me being a flight risk.\n\nI am bonded with my brother Zorro and we need to get adopted together.

But if you look into his soulful eyes, you'll see a dog who hasn't had it easy these last few years and is happy to be back at PACC, where he spent some time as a puppy back in 2018. Midnight is friendly with people, but he's a little more selective when it comes to other furry friends. For such a young guy, Midnight has had kind of a tough life. He needs a nice home and a loving owner to show him that life can be good, and even great, in the right circumstances. Do you have some room in your home and heart for this young guy? Ask Midnight's volunteer advocate, Christy, about him: christy.holliger@gmail.com MIDNIGHT IS ENROLLED IN THE GOOD DOG PROJECT AT PACC - Read a message from his case manager here: tinyurl.com/gdpmessage - Ask his case manager about him: rachel.jones@pima.gov - Schedule an appt to meet him: tinyurl.com/casemanagermeet",

She was rescued at 3 months old, and was incorrectly diagnosed once she was taken to get a 2nd opinion, the Dr said her blindness was due to a swollen nerve in her ear, she was put on treatment and in no time she could see again! Nona is an incredible dog, very friendly, and falls in love with everyone she meets whether it's people or other dogs. She has wonderful social skills, walks well on a leash, crate trained, rides well in the car, loves squeaky toys, and loves to play with her foster siblings. Nona still has a lot to learn, she's is an active girl who will love to go on adventures and explore new things. She's very loving and obedient. A loving family willing to continuing giving her her daily supplement so she can continue enjoying her life to the fullest will be the perfect match for this wonderful sweet girl. In new environments and when stressed or excited, Nona will still turn in circles as she did prior to being rescued, but she settles once comfortable in a familiar place with a stable routine.",

He is very shy at first but he is starting to show his playful side here at the shelter. He is food motivated and loves his pets and belly rubs. He is not potty trained so that is something that he will need to learn. He has not been on a walk since he has been here because he is not a fan of leashes but we are working on that with him. He will need to be neutered once he is adopted. It is unknown how he is with other dogs, cats, and children. If you have any questions or are interested in adopting Simba please contact the shelter at 313-970-5269! \n\nMore pictures and videos are available on our facebook page!",

NOTE: THIS IS A COURTESY POSTING ONLY! THIS DOG IS NOT AVAILABLE THROUGH BROTHER WOLF ANIMAL RESCUE\n\nHiya! I am Gallagher! Although you won't find me smashing any watermelons, I definitely can provide entertainment and some comedic relief on dreary or lonely days. My droopy eyes, compact size, and adorable facial expressions are sure to pack any venue! Why am I here you ask? Well, I am a recent graduate of the ASPCA's Behavioral Rehabilitation Center*. Since there aren't any open mics in my area, I am posting my profile here hoping to find my family. I am still learning about the world and building more and more confidence every day! I walk politely on leash and enjoy the company of other dogs. I am looking for an understanding and patient family who enjoys going for walks and exploring the outdoors. Will work for applause (or tasty treats)! No hecklers need apply. Can't wait to meet ya!\n\nThe ASPCA's Behavioral Rehabilitation Center (BRC) is the first and only facility of its kind dedicated to the study and rehabilitation of extremely fearful dogs.

I love other dogs and like being around them when participating in playgroup, but I'm also a mellow little lady who sometimes just prefers the company of humans. Speaking of humans, I would need to be in a home with humans over the age of 10, just because I am not a big fan of loud noises and would prefer not to have little munchkins hanging on me. While I am mostly back to normal health, I still require a few medications that I may need to be on for the rest of my life. Don't worry though, I more than make up for it with my love and affection! I would love to be your new best friend!",

Let me tell me my story.\n\nAn elderly gentleman had gone out to his backyard to feed his 2 dogs.  Well, poof there I was.  He had no idea how I got there, and honestly neither do I!  I stayed there with the other 2 dogs, who I made friends with.  The dogs were cool, but the old man, not so much.  Not sure why I felt that way about him.  After all, he was feeding and taking care of me now as well.\n\nI was just really scared of him.  So he called Lucies and of course, they found room for me!  They took me in and are taking really good care of me.  While I like it here, I would really like to have a family for my very own.  One that I don't have to share with anyone else.\n\nI'm a shy and timid dog, but am slowly coming out of my turtle shell. (See what I did there?)  ;)  I'm crate trained and am learning to train on a leash, however I have not completely mastered that skill yet. \n\nI get along well with other dogs and like to romp and play.  I do tend to carry myself like a tiny show dog, prancing around here and there.  I'd love to show you sometime.  I'm sure you'll be impressed!!\n\n*** We strive to ensure our dogs are going to a safe, loving and caring home. Phone interviews are required for all adoptions****",

His fee is reduced to $90 plus tax.  Meet Rhythm!  Isn't he gorgeous!?!  Rhythm is a sweet guy that needs a new home. He is smart and willing to learn.  Rhythm just wants to be by your side and seems like a really loyal dog.  He seems like a really good buddy dog.  He most likely would like a home where he can do things with his owner, go on car rides and just be a best buddy.  Rhythm LOVES treats.  So much so he can forget there are human fingers involved.  He will snatch them as fast as he can. He needs some work on this.    We are looking for a home without young kids. Please do your research on Australian Cattle Dogs before considering adoption. This breed has unique needs and personalities.  They are active, need a lot of exercise and are really smart.  They are bred to perform demanding tasks and take their jobs seriously. They are often surrendered due to owners not understanding this when they get a Cattle Dog.   Rhythm needs a new owner that knows that they are getting into! Unique thing about Rhythm is he has a docked tail.   \n\nI am fixed, current on my rabies, distemper and kennel cough vaccinations. I am heartworm negative(dogs 6 months and older are tested at CCHS) and started on heartworm prevention. I have been de-wormed and I have also been microchipped. I will also be inspected by \n a vet and receive a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection.  If you are interested in me, please head to the CCHS website at www.cchswi.org and fill out an application.

A mid-sized girl at 42lbs, take one look at her and you just know she has not led a pampered life but she's such a great sport and takes everything in great stride, so she likely does not know how life should be for a pretty girl such as herself. Her days of having multiple litters are now over and her mommy apron strings now retired. Clarice enjoyed trotting around our play area all the while coming over to check on me to deliver a fast smooch, a quick little hug or a fun little hula dance. Clarice is friendly and snuggly and seemed most content while simply sitting with me on the cold cement bench in the play yard. She checked out the cars as they came and went and made sure I had plenty of wet nose nudges. Great choice as a family pet but she does require a home without cats. You know you want to meet this great girl, so book a time to come on out. She'll not disappoint you.\n\nOur adoption fee includes neutering, microchip, appropriate shots, and a post adoption veterinarian wellness check.",

I like to run and play outside a lot and I like dog toys, but I rip them up. I love head rubs and being loved on. I can get very rambunctious at times and I get the zoomies, and I am a bit clumsy because my feet are big... I hope I grow into them soon. I also love the snow. If I ever need to be alone, I need to be kenneled because I get nervous.\"\n\nCome meet Bubblegum at KCCAC today!\n\nHave a dog at home already? Bubblegum would love to meet them at KCCAC first before going home to ensure it's a perfect fit!",

I was transferred here to the VBSPCA in hopes of a better chance of finding the perfect home, with the perfect family who understands my needs. I am a very high energy dog. It appears that I have a bit of the herding breed in my lines. I would love a family that already has experience with herding dog breeds. I am also deaf and need a family who will be patient and help me learn sign commands. If you have experience with deaf dogs or dogs that have had some loss of hearing that would be a bonus. One more thing, because I wasn't properly cared for the first go around, I have heartworm disease.no worries, it can be treated. The wonderful folks at Hertferd County Animal Shelter where I originally came from, have donated $200 towards my treatment. After my treatment and rest, I will need an active lifestyle. Any children in the home should be 12 years and up and no apartments please! If you are looking to rescue and love and Underdog and you are ready to change a life, ask for me Tonka. A manager would be happy to answer any questions and counsel you on my unique adoption. See you soon!",

Chadd is a little shy in a silly manner that just makes him that much more charming!\nChadd is a very gentle and submissive guy that has done well with the dogs he as met. He has been a little unsure walking around the shelter due to the noise and commotion so walking on a leash will need some practice. Since we do not know his history cats are an unknown and he was to scared to really even pay attention to the ones he met here at the shelter.\n\n***Chadd was given a 4 DX Test that test for Heartworm and several Tick born diseases  in the blood. One being Lyme Disease. He came back Negative for Heartworm but Positive for Lyme so he has begun the Anitibiotic regiment to treat him for it!***\n\nChadd has been neutered, Microchipped, is current on all Vaccines including Rabies. He has been given a dewormer, started on Flea/Tick prevention, Heartworm tested (NEGATIVE) and given Heartworm Prevention\n\nIf interested in learning more about Chadd please email the Shelter Director @ gjenkins@orangecountyva.gov\nhttp://www.orangecountyva.gov/DocumentCenter/View/361/Pre-Adoption-Application?bidId=",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Please contact Ruth (rpriestley@sciotodowns.com) for more information about this pet.Linnette's adoption donation is $400 and she is being fostered in Central Ohio. She has been spayed, microchipped, received her rabies, distemper/parvo, bivalent canine influenza, and bordetella vaccines, tested negative for heartworms and started on flea prevention, as well as flea prevention. She has also had a dental cleaning.\nShe will require a home with a secure, physically fenced yard and a companion dog of similar size.\n\nLinnette, or Lynn, came into rescue from a commercial breeder and she is making a lot of progress in rescue. Lynn is an approximately 4-5 year old Papillon who is very sweet and learning to be a dog. Like most mill dogs, she is more comfortable being around other dogs but is quickly learning to be the social butterfly. Linnette does well with housetraining if kept on a schedule and continues to improve her leash skills. She will require a home with a secure, physically fenced yard and a companion dog of similar size. PLEASE NOTE: If you are viewing this biography on a website other than the Ohio Fuzzy Pawz website, not all information transfers to partner websites in some instances. If you go to the individual webpage of our dogs, you will be able to get more information each dog.\n\nVisual breed identification in dogs can be unreliable so, in many cases, we are only guessing at the predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n\nOur Adoption Process\n\nThe adoption process has several steps involved.\n\nPlease review prior to submitting an application.\nOur adoption process is detailed here:\n\nhttp://www.ohiofuzzypawz.com/info/adoption\n\nOur volunteers work very diligently to process each application and we try to ensure that we are making the best match possible for each dog. We do not schedule meetings with dogs until an application has been approved. It can take up to a few weeks to process an application or as little time as a few days, from the time you submit an application, please be prepared to adopt as we cannot hold dogs.\n\nSpecial Requirements\n\nSome dogs may have special requirements (for example, medications, a fence) -- if you apply for a dog, please be sure to read over the biography completely to see if there are any special needs and if you're home would be suitable. If we indicate on the dog's biography that a fence is required, this means your home must have a physical fence. Other dogs may require a \"strong vet reference\" which indicates that we are looking for a home that has a documented history of veterinary care with previous pets.\n\nThe first step in our process is to submit an online adoption application at www.ohiofuzzypawz.com/forms. The application MUST include the personal references and veterinary, grooming, and landlord references (if applicable) and their respective contact information. If you do not include the references and the contact information, your application will be delayed as it CANNOT be processed. Once the references have been successfully completed, a home visit is then scheduled when a rescue representative can meet all members of the family or residents of the home.\nNo application is approved prior to the home visit being done.\nAt that point, the Directors will discuss any and all applications on a foster dog and make a selection--in many cases, there are multiple applications for each dog, so please be understanding that our only priority is the successful placement of each of our foster dogs.\n\nOut of State Adoptions\n\nWe do adopt out of state to outstanding applicants, however, our process requires a home visit, so out of state adoptions can take longer.\nWe do not ship our dogs, adopters should be prepared to pick up the dog in Central Ohio.",

It's hard not to fall in love with her at first sight given how cute she is, with her floppy Dumbo ears, soulful eyes, and a little \"blep\" tongue that comes out when she's excited. She is an affectionate girl who loves people, often leaning in and flopping down for a belly rub. Pebbles is the perfect mix of dog: calm inside the house and active outside. She loves long walks, but is as happy cuddling on the couch (super polite - waits to be asked up). She is fully crate and house trained and already knows a few commands (sit, down, and always will rollover). While in foster, she has been working on her leash skills and has made great progress, though will need her future family to continue this training. She is a gentle girl so could make a great family dog. Pebbles is dog selective (no experience with cats), so looking to be the only pet or potentially with dogs her size. Whoever adopts her will have a best friend for life!\n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $425",

            "description": "Meet Reyna! \n\nThis gorgeous girl is sweet as can be. She is a precious 55 lbs girl, about 2 years old. Her ears were chopped off by whoever previously had her, so she has a tough look, but is such a sweet girl. She has tons of personality, and is a happy go lucky girl who loves to play with toys. She LOVES bouncy balls.\n\nReyna is a great car rider and companion! She would love to ride along. She will look at you with the most loving eyes and with gratitude. She makes for a really good best friend. She is little bit clingy so she would love someone who has availability for her. She would love to snuggle if you will let her. \n\n She should be an only dog in the house, but She has no issue passing other dogs on walks or trotting happily by them at boarding (check out her video!). She may do okay with a super chill, laid back sibling who can help her rebuild her confidence, but would probably do best as a single dog for right now. She thinks kitties are for chasing, too, so none of those please! \n \n\nReyna needs someone willing to work with her a bit. She crates up fine but does have some normal bad habits such as jumping up when she is excited. So basic training would be good. She needs someone experienced to draw boundaries and redirect. \n\nReyna is medium energy, and always up to play or go on adventures! She loves going for car rides, and has never met a human that she doesn't like. She's a favorite at the vet's office, pet store, and boarding kennel, and it's not hard to see why! This happy girl will light up your life, and give you so much love in return for being her forever human.\n\nReyna is potty trained and crate trained. \n\nReyna has energy to go on hikes and adventures. But knows when to calm down and just show love. \n\nReyna is up to date on all vaccines, spayed, microchipped, wormed, and comes with 6 months of heartworm prevention and a month of free pet insurance through Trupanion. The vet says she looks to be in great condition!\n\nPlease fill out an application:\n\nhttps://petstablished.com/adoption_form/19754/generic\n\nCoordinator: Olga@threelittlepittiesrescue.org",

He would love a home with a yard to run around in and an owner who is willing to work on his leash manners. He has been working with a trainer while in foster and his progress is night and day. Training doesn't stop here though, and we want to be sure he finds a home to continue with him.",

            "description": "IMPORTANT!!!   All adoptions are by appointment only going forward and are spaced 30 minutes apart. PLEASE call the shelter directly during business hours for more information (see number below).  You need to make sure that the animal in which you have an interest is still available and to set up an appointment to meet the specific animal.  Once you arrive at the shelter for your scheduled appointment, please follow the directions that you were given over the telephone. If you are running late for your appointment or will be unable to make your scheduled appointment time, notify staff immediately. This will enable them to schedule that time for another prospective adoptive family. If necessary, they will be able to reschedule your appointment to a more convenient time.  \n\nNO CHILDREN!!! Needs to be the only dog in the family.\nFRECKLES is a brown and white mixture of cattle dog and boxer. She is estimated to be a year old and has been at the shelter about a month at the time of this posting. She has been settling in to the routine and being evaluated for adoptability. FRECKLES was scared upon arrival and has gone back-and-forth between liking other dogs and not liking them so much. Staff does not actually train the dogs at the shelter, but does give them time to relax and show their true nature to the extent possible given that they are kept in kennels and usually housed alone until space restraints require them to attempt to pair suitable animals to accommodate overloads. Based on their overall evaluation of FRECKLES, staff now indicates that while she is adoptable and could do well in a farm setting, she is not appropriate for adoption to a home with children and needs to be the only dog in the family if she is to be a pet. She definitely needs to be confined to a properly fenced and secure yard or kept inside the home at all times except for when you personally take her out to do her business. She is a dominant dog and needs someone who is willing to work with a qualified trainer, or who has the professional skill set themselves, to make sure she remains a good dog in our community.\n\nAdoption fees are $80 for dogs.  Cat adoption fees are $50. Cash or check only. Please be sure to take the exact amount with you.\n\n\nNOTE: All shelter fees are under review and may be changed or modified at any time without advance notice.\n\nThe shelter routinely vaccinates all healthy appearing animals upon their arrival at the shelter and deworms them.  Any animals not already spayed/neutered must have the procedure done through the veterinary clinic that contracts with the county before that animal can be released from the clinic to the new family. By state law, animals old enough to be given a rabies vaccine, must have that vaccine done, as well.  The vaccine is given by the veterinary clinic staff at a separate cost to the adoptive family. \n\nHold periods for every incoming animal vary for several reasons including, but not limited to, whether the animal came in from the Cumberland County area, or from the City of Crossville, which contracts with the county for its animal shelter services.  Check with the staff to verify the availability date of every animal for which you have an interest.\n\nFor more information on this pet, call the shelter at (931)484-8525. The shelter is open Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday from 10am to 2pm. Closed Wednesday and Sunday and county observed holidays.",

I then went to an amazing lady in Texas where my rescue saved me. They don't know much about me except I'm roughly under a year old, 24 pounds, and a total ham. I have no eyes and only have three legs, they aren't sure what happened but it doesn't stop me one bit. I love to run around with my friends they are so much fun. I can't see them but I can hear every sound they make and I can keep up with them - Im pretty fast I say. When I go outside I get so excited I jump around like a kangaroo and my foster mom laughs. I love to snuggle with my foster mom, I cuddle real good. She tells me one day I'll get a new mommy and she will love me just like she does even though I look alittle different.\nI promise to give you all the love, if you chose me.\nComplete Application\n\nYou must complete the adoption application in full to be considered for adoption.\n\nHome Check\nAll adoptions do require a home check. If you are not comfortable with a home check please do not apply. We want to ensure the safety of our dogs and to make sure the adoptive family is comfortable.\nMeet and Greet\nIf your application has been approved we will schedule a meet and greet for the dog of your choice or for a few we think might be a good fit for your family.\nSign Adoption Contract\nThis must be read and signed prior to adoption.\nAdoption Fee\nOnce everything has been reviewed the adoption fee will need to be paid.

I know \"sit\" and \"lay down\" and am learning about potty training. I really like food and treats, so my foster mom says that really helps when it comes to training. I'm already crate trained too.\n\nScout is being fostered in Nebraska.\n\nComplete the adoption form here : ADOPT ME\n\n*Please be sure to read the adoption info/FAQ tab on our main website before applying for a dog.",

Her adoption fee will include vaccinations, worming, microchipping and spaying.  Katrina is easy-going and loves affection.  She is fair on a leash and needs some practice.  Katrina loves treats and will be easy to train. We think Katrina is good with cats...at least she did well with the shelter cat....she never tried to run after the cat and seemed interested in getting to know the cat.  I am betting she will be good with kids and other dogs because of her sweet personality.  Come meet Katrina and see for yourself if she might be a great fit for you and your family.",

Really, I'm kind of lonely and want some attention shown to me. I'm a real character that will entertain you for life! I'm the cutest ball of fun and I'm really smart. I want to be the one plucked for the family pie! I'm not rotten to the core! So come down and pick me from the tree!\nHere is what the crew has to say about me:Sandy is about 2 years old. She is friendly and nice. She came in with Sindy from the country. Just two Honky Tonk girls. She would make a nice family dog. She is always a happy girl!\nPlease call Faustina at 806-664-1615 since she can give you details about the animals! If you call the Pampa animal shelter please refer to the animals by their number listed after the names. Thank you for you cooperation!",

She loves to go for walks with friends, both furry and human. She takes treats gently like a good girl, plays well with other dogs, enjoys the company of cats (she lived with cats before), and has more energy than most girls her age (9-years-old)!\n\nEllie is fairly food-motivated, which is always a plus when training or when trying to get her to cooperate (though this isn\u2019t a dog that protests too much in the first place). She enjoys play time but walking and getting pets are her favorite activities.\n\nWe think Ellie would be a great addition to any family, and we think you should come meet her and find out for yourself just how great she is.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting any of our adoptable dogs, please fill out an application. To apply, please visit our web site: https://www.mlar.org/adoption-overview \n\nE-mails regarding adoption are not considered an application. \n\nOut-of-state applicants (outside of PA/NJ/DE) will not be considered, unless there are special circumstances. Please visit our web site for more detailed information on the animals in our care, our educational campaigns, and for helpful tips on adoption. www.MLAR.org",

Once she was able to trust she became a very loving and sweet girl.  \n\nShe is now house trained, loves other dogs, walks on her leash very well and learning.  Trix needs a yard with a fence over or at least 6 foot. She can scale a 4 foot without touching it!  She isn't a runner, but will want to meet and greet other dogs.   She loves to play and loves interaction with people.  she is a snuggle bug of the best kind!\n\nIf you would like to meet this sweet girl just inquire for an application.",

            "description": "Bart is a special needs senior looking for a very special home. When Bart came to FARM it didn\u2019t take long for us to figure out just how special he is. Bart is both blind and deaf. He also has what\u2019s known as short snout syndrome which means he breaths very loud. At 11 years old Bart\u2019s favorite activity is napping and eating. This boy LOVES to eat. His home requirements include no steps or the ability to block steps off so he doesn\u2019t fall and a nice soft bed that will stay in the same spot forever so he always knows where it is. He will take about 2 weeks to to settle into a new home and learn his new environment. He might not be able to see or hear but he can smell and always knows when it\u2019s dinner time. Also, his voice works and he isn\u2019t shy about using it when he wants something. If you are looking for a senior snuggly, snorty pug Bart is your guy. \n\nIf you are interested in Bart, or any other FARM dog, please submit an application for review by our Adoption Committee. Meet and greets for approved adopters will be by appointment only. If you are interested in adopting, please fill out a dog application which can be found at http://fallstonanimalrescue.org/adopt/ and e-mail it to fallstonrescue@aol.com\n\nIt can take up to 2 weeks to process an application; we suggest following up by email on the status if you have not received a reply within 3-5 days. We are an all-volunteer based rescue and we ask for your patience if we are slow to respond.\n\nPlease understand that we fit the dog with the home we feel is best suited and will accept multiple applications for one dog. We have strict requirements for families with children under 10 since many of our dogs are grumpy and may not do well with children. Some dogs will have fence requirements, while others may not. It is preferred you are within a 2 hour drive from our Rescue Center in Fallston, MD and preference will be given to local applicants.\n\nA pet is a lifetime commitment and it is our duty to do our very best to place them correctly the first time around. We do not take the adoption process lightly. Thank you for choosing to adopt not shop!\n\n\n",

If you are looking for a precious dog that will curl up next to you (or in your lap!), then this is your girl!  She also enjoys hanging out on her doggie bed with a toy.  Being a youngster, she enjoys zooming around the back yard and exploring, but also enjoys quiet time.\n\nKia is a beautiful girl with soulful eyes and the softest of fur.  She has a gentle, sweet demeanor that you will fall in love with immediately.\n\nShe trained herself quickly to use a doggie door and would most likely convert that to being potty trained without a doggie door quickly.\n\nKia could go to a home with or without another dog, depending on the dog.  She currently enjoys playing/hanging out with a 50 lb dog in her foster home.\n\nShe is excited and ready to go to her furrever home.\n\nArrangements can be made to meet her in advance of adoption with an APPLICATION.  Her adoption fee will be $195 and includes all shots, spay, and microchip.\n\nMore Info:  Contact Jeanette at jeanette.debar@yahoo.com.\n\nNMAF dogs cannot be adopted out of the greater Albuquerque / Santa Fe area.\n\nAdoption Clinic Location:  PetSmart - Academy & Wyoming, Saturdays, 10:00 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. - Currently Suspended\n\nPlease visit our website at www.nmaf.org for more information.",

Cadman, weighing 75 lbs, was rescued by the Great Pyrenees Rescue Society from a Texas animal shelter as an owner surrender.\n\nCadman is reserved when first meeting new people and dogs. He prefers to go slow in new situations. He would thrive in an active home with older, considerate kids and a resident canine companion to show him the ropes. He is okay around cats.\n\nHe is a loving, intelligent Pyr and needs confident leaders in his family familiar with Pyr characteristics and habits. Please complete an Adoption Application if Cadman would fit perfectly with your family today and every day.\n\nAll dogs and puppies require VISIBLE fencing\n\nAdoption Fee: $300. (Adoption fee includes spay/neuter, heartworm test, rabies, distemper, parvo and health certificate for travel). Northwest adopters pay the cost of transport to independent transport service ($225). Adoption applications can be found on our website at https://www.greatpyreneesrescuesociety.org/.\n\nADOPTION, FOSTERING, AND DONATIONS are just some of the ways you can help a rescued dog. We have worked hard to cultivate a large network of volunteers to save this majestic breed. While monetary donations are always much appreciated, you can also help by donating your time as a GPRS foster or volunteer!",

            "description": "\"Shy, attractive Pyr.\" Meet Caz, an unassuming Pyr born around January 2017. Caz, weighing 75 lbs, was rescued by the Great Pyrenees Rescue Society from a Texas animal shelter as a stray.\n\nCaz is timid when you first meet him. He prefers to go slow when meeting new people and dogs. He would flourish in an active home with older, considerate kids and no other pets.\n\nHe is an apprehensive, intelligent Pyr and needs confident leaders in his family familiar with Pyr traits and habits. Please complete an Adoption Application if Caz would be a pawesome addition to your family.\n\nAll dogs and puppies require VISIBLE fencing\n\nAdoption Fee: $300. (Adoption fee includes spay/neuter, heartworm test, rabies, distemper, parvo and health certificate for travel). Northwest adopters pay the cost of transport to independent transport service ($225). Adoption applications can be found on our website at https://www.greatpyreneesrescuesociety.org/.\n\nADOPTION, FOSTERING, AND DONATIONS are just some of the ways you can help a rescued dog. We have worked hard to cultivate a large network of volunteers to save this majestic breed. While monetary donations are always much appreciated, you can also help by donating your time as a GPRS foster or volunteer!",

            "description": "Teagan is a 2.5 year old beauty who would love to be off and running in your large, securely-fenced yard. She is a \u201cpocket Setter\u201d who weighs about 30 pounds, so she is lap-sized as well. What could be better than a Setter who loves to run and loves to cuddle.\n\nTrue to her breed, Teagan loves to run hard chasing birds and squirrels, which means she needs a Setter-interesting yard with at least a 6-foot fence. She is the poster girl for the saying \u201cA tired Setter is a happy Setter.\u201d Teagan needs a very active person. A good size yard is not enough. This girl needs someone that will ideally run, or at least take her on long/fast daily walks.  She gets along well with other dogs and likes playing with toys, but if Teagan could make a list the #1 entry would be \u201cRunning after birds and squirrels.\u201d Happily, #2 would be \u201cCuddling with humans.\u201d\n\nTeagan walks well on a leash and is house trained. She has good recall in the yard, but could never be trusted off-leash in an unfenced area. Her foster mom says, \u201cShe is really fast!!\u201d She has lived peacefully with the resident cat, but would need supervision and slow acclimation in a home with cats to make sure she would be safe with a new cat. Because of Teagan\u2019s prey-drive, outdoor cats are not an option. Teagan needs a home with Setter or Setter like experience. She needs a home with furniture privileges. Teagan has not been in a home with children, and she is very active, so she is only a candidate for homes with children 7+ years of age.\n\nTeagan is fully-vetted and microchipped. She is currently in a foster home in Houston, TX.\n\nFor an application to adopt or for more information about Southwest English Setter Rescue including our adoption requirements and transport availability, please go to http://www.swesr.org/.

Before my time at Nuzzles, I had it pretty rough, but I'm loving life now and learning how to be the best dog I can be! I really love playing with other dogs. I am the playgroup star at Nuzzles & Co! Cats, however, are a no-go. I see them as furry toys, and I don't understand why everyone keeps telling me I can't chase them! Well, enough about me. Go ahead and fill out an application so we can get to know each other better! I can't wait to meet you!",

I get along with my friend Guac here at HSMC very well, we play together like we are siblings! I love to play with toys and other dogs. I can climb short fences so I should not be left outside alone. I am good with children and people of all ages. If you want to make me a part of your furever family, come see me today!Please read the animal bios completely before requesting additional information as we do our best to answer the most frequently ask questions in these bios. \n\nIn order to adopt one of our animals an application must be submitted and approved. You can find these applications by going to http://humanemorgan.org/index.php?page=adoption \n\nABOUT ADOPTING FROM THE HSMC: \nThe shelter address is 1170 Fairground Rd. Madison, GA 30650. For more information on any of our pets, please feel free to email us at INFO@HUMANEMORGAN.ORG give us a call at 706-343-9977. \nAll dogs are heartworm negative, current on vaccines/dewormings, and microchipped. \nAll cats are FeLv/FIV negative, current on vaccines/dewormings, and microchipped. \nWe are open 10am-5pm Monday-Saturday, we schedule our last adoption at 4pm everyday to allow our staff enough time to feed and walk dogs. \nWe are an animal shelter and therefore are not able to individually potty train our residents. Many adult dogs do arrive \"\"house broken\"\" however due to animal behavior any change in environment will make an emotional impact on the animals and therefore initiate unwanted behaviors during the acclamation period. Please keep this in mind. Puppies do not have the biological maturity to maintain absolute bladder or bowel control and will require a certain degree of potty training and house breaking. Please consider the time and commitment it takes to provide the necessary building blocks for these special babies, prior to submitting your application. \nIf you have any questions please email us at info@humanemorgan.org and provide name of the animal you are interested in, in the subject line. \nThank you, HSMC Staff \n\nADOPTION FEES Adoption Fees may change without notice. Always verify the fee when finalizing the adoption. \n~ Cats and Kittens ~ \n* Under 1 Year = $100 \n* 1-5 Years = $75 \n* Over 5 Years = $50 \n** Purebred cats and kittens may be subject to special pricing \n\n~ Mix Breed Dogs ~ \n* Under 1 Year = $200 \n* 1 -3 Years = $175 \n* 4-8 Years = $150 \n* Over 8 Years = $100\n\n~ Purebred and Designer Breed Dogs ~ \n* Under 1 Year = $375 \n* 1-3 Years = $350 \n* 4-8 Years = $275 \n* Over 8 Years = $150 \n\n~ Medical and Special Needs ~ \nWe have rescued dogs and cats which require additional medical care or that have special needs which are not life threatening. In these cases we may require a higher fee to help recoup the costs of their care while at our rescue.",

I usually prefer submissive dogs since I like to be the boss of the group; I especially like the girls! \n\nI still have puppy energy at times and will get the zoomies right after I eat a meal. I do get a bit mouthy (not mean) and jumpy with my human when I am excited, but I listen pretty well when you tell me \"no\" and if you ignore me, I lose interest. \n\nI am potty trained, crate trained and use the dog door like a champ, too! I enjoy walks and walk well on a leash. I would love to have a family that is active and can take me with them on all their adventures!! My family shouldn't have kids under 10 since I'm very food motivated and would happily relieve small children of their snacks. hee hee!\n\nWould you be willing to be patient and kind, but also firm with me and give me my furever home for this new year we've started?? \nPretty Please? Did I mention I love to cuddle and I'll even tilt my head in a cute way when you talk to me! I am being fostered in the Denver/Metro area, so fill out an application today! Visit www.elpasocountycanine.org\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit our website and complete an adoption application at www.elpasocountycanine.org/adopt",

They could not keep me so they brought me here. I would do best in a home where I am the only animal. I love kids and have been dubbed quite the nanny dog. I have been in a home with children as young as an infant. I love to cuddle and play. If you want me for your new best friend, please see a member of my Kennel Staff Family and they can arrange a meet & greet for us. Thank you for visiting with us today. \n\nLove, Saber",

            "description": "Omar, who knows the name \"\"Goose\"\" now was in a home where he was very loved, and very spoiled. He went on several good walks a week and had a fenced back yard where he could sunbathe and run around. He also had his favorite lap to sit on (yes, that's right - this 65 pound dog knows a good lap to sit on when he sees it!). His owners have had some life changes and illnesses recently, which led Goose to get less of his walks and less attention. This needy guy really wanted someone to play with, and figured out how to hop over his chainlink fence. This was a huge cause for concern due to being located near a busy highway. This big, goofy guy loves running, so he really needs a secure privacy fenced backyard, or a nice farm, in order to be his happiest self. They did not want to bring him back, but knew it would be in his best interest to find a safe place for him to run and live life the way he enjoys it. \nThat being said, his previous family had SO MANY good things to say about him!\nGoose loves blankets, and loves to be wrapped up like a pup-burrito. He never had a single accident in the house - He will go to the door or pace the house when he needs to potty. He does not like cats or small dogs and cannot live with them, however, he loves the company of dogs his size and will play with them! Goose can go on walks or runs for hours. He would make a wonderful hiking companion! Goose knows the commands sit, stay, lay, and come. He enjoys car rides and usually ends up napping during them. He loves sleeping in bed with his people (and he's been known to be a bit of a bed hog). Goose is the PERFECT family dog and loves children of all ages, although he can be pretty excitable and knock small children over. He has been around livestock of all kinds and looks at them like friends instead of snacks! We know that thunderstorms scare him and he likes to be with his people or in a kennel when there is one happening. \n\nWe have estimated that Goose was born 03/01/2017 , and he currently weighs 65lbs....All pets have lifetime sanctuary at Haven of the Ozarks.

            "description": "*Due to concerns surrounding COVID-19, we have reformatted the way that we do adoptions in order to follow social distancing protocols. We are thrilled that so many people want to adopt right now, but we are not equipped to handle the large number of calls, applications, and email inquiries we are receiving. We are no longer answering phone calls and are doing all communications with adopters via email. If you have a dog you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application before sending us emails. When your application has been processed, you will receive an email from us with further instructions on how to adopt. You do not need a new application for every dog that you are interested in adopting. \n\nAt MAMCO we understand that in order to continue rescuing moms and babies, we must stretch our finances as far as we are able. For this reason we use variable adoption pricing. By assigning higher adoption fees to high demand moms and puppies, we are able to rescue more families in need.The money raised through these adoptions acts as a benefactor to moms and puppies in our care who require expensive veterinary treatments, have behavioral issues, or need more time to find a home. We often reduce the adoption fees on these harder-to-place moms and puppies to help them find forever families. Adoption fees vary, but all include spay or neuter, microchip, up to date vaccinations and deworming, rabies vaccine at the time of spay or neuter, and 30 days of pet insurance. We also cover hernia repair and cherry eye repair at the time of spay or neuter. Applications can be filled out at mamcorescue.org.",

I am a very well mannered girl who is housetrained and walks well on a leash. While the humans don't know a ton about my past, they estimate me to be 2-3 years old and don't think I would do well with cats, but do think I lived with other dogs. They are not positive about children, but my demeanor is so laid back that I think I would do well with them. I am not yet spayed, but am heartworm negative and up to date on vaccines and prevention.",

She was found by an animal lover wandering around a west Texas city. Due to being recently groomed the finder expected to locate her family quickly. Unfortunately that didn't happen. Despite having a microchip it wasn't registered and the shelter that inserted the chip had no records at this point of who she was chipped by. The shelters , groomers, vets were all notified that she had been found. She has waited 2 weeks to be claimed to no avail. Now she's headed up us to find her next family! \n\nIf you can help her please content us ASAP!\n\n $150.00 Adoption Fee \n\n(Which is considered a non refundable donation and being we are a 501c3 organization it is tax deductible. The fee itself is not negotiable, our vets don't negotiate and thus neither do we.)\n\nTo Contact Us\n\nMessage us through our website http://www.highplainspaw.org\n\nMessage the Facebook Page at https://www.facebook.com/HighPlainsPAW\n\nFill out our Adoption Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/adoption-application\n\nFill out our Foster Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/foster-application\n\nEmail us at highplainspaw@gmail.com\n\nCall our VOICEMAIL at (402)957-1578\n\nWE DO NOT HAVE A FACILITY ALL OUR DOGS ARE LOCATED IN FOSTER HOMES. This means there is no place for you to go in person to view our dogs. We ask that an application be filled out and we will go from there!",

            "description": "Nicky and Millie were found locked in a chicken coop being abused by their owner. The 11 year old child within the home took it upon himself to reach out to a woman within the rescue world to tell her that as much as he loved his puppies, he needed her to save them from his father. Because of that brave young boy, Nicky and Millie have known nothing but safety, love and warmth for the past few months. Nicky and Millie have a very special bond experiencing what they have as brother and sister, therefore we will be adopting them as a bonded pair.\n\n Millie is extremely smart, obervant and loves to cuddle. She is roughly 9 months old, 9 lbs and we believe she is a chihuahua/terrier mix (but as with any rescue, it's always a best guess). Millie is excellent on the leash and she definitely wants to be the boss and can have a little bit of a Diva attitude which gives her some character! Millie has been working very hard in her foster home and her foster tells us that she is completely potty trained. \n\nBoth Nicky and Millie are being fostered in Sonoma County, 95403. They have been doing fabulously in their foster home and have settled in very nicely. They are currently being fostered with children, and do to their size we will adopt them to a home with children 5 and older.\n\nIf you are interested, please fill out an application and send all supporting documentation.\n\nYou can find the application at www.softpawsrescue.org/applytoadopt (if you're unable to fill out the PDF, please print it out, fill it out and take pictures)\n\nAdditionally, pictures of the inside of your home (not just one room, but any place the dog might be), as well as your front and back yards",

            "description": "Name: Lilac (Female)\nBreed: Pointer mix\nAdoptable in: MA, RI, NH, CT, and VT\n\nGood with dogs: Yes, with proper intros\nGood with cats: No\nGood with kids: No\nCrate trained: Yes\nHouse trained: Yes\n\nLilac is a sweet, lazy girl who is looking for a quiet home where she can play some fetch and then curl up in the dog bed and take a nap (her two favorite things). Lilac is wonderful with other dogs when properly introduced, and she loves to play. She would love a fenced yard to romp in. She can be leash reactive to new dogs, and though she has improved with training, this will always be something she needs to work on. For this reason, proper intros are a must with her. She is also ecollar trained. so her perfect home would continue this training with her. She excels with structure and routine.\n\nWhere Lilac still struggles greatly is with meeting new people in the home. Outside the home, and even a the vet, she is generally fine. When people that she does not know very very well come into the home, Lilac should be crated, leashed, or muzzled. She needs to be slowly introduced to new people, but once she gets to know you very very well, she's all in and is the kissiest, snuggliest girl. She is even very sweet to pretty much everyone while muzzled, so that's an easy fix to keep her safe. When people she does not know come into the home, she has an angry bark/growl but when introduced while muzzled she does fine. Because of her reactivity to new people, a single family home is the best fit for her. She would not do well in an apartment. Lilac has had a long road, and while she has come a long way, she is very much still a work in progress. With the right family she will do just fine.\n\nLilac's issues have happened in the past when her intros to new people coming into the home were not controlled (once, my contractor came in my back door while we were in the living room, and another time, my dog walker let her out of her crate after I advised her not to). So I can't emphasize enough that she needs to take it slow with new people :) But she will reward you for sure once you get to know her.\n\nAge: 6 years\nWeight: 45 lbs\n\nPlease Note: All dogs are posted until they are officially adopted. This dog may have other interested adopters in line. If you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application on our website at http://www.lasthopek9.org/ \n\nQuestions?

He is good on the leash except for when he sees other dogs, which can get him excited.  \nMario is a good watchdog tending over his foster family's house.  He sleeps in the bed under the covers (see his photos; he does that with the dog beds too!).  \nMario wants to be with his people.  He follows his foster parents everywhere around the house and enjoys it when he has the opportunity to share a spot on the couch with them.  He is fine being left in the house with other dogs on the occasions where his people aren't home.   \n\n\n**Dogs listed here have entered our program and have received a basic level of vet care including: vaccines (DHLPP & Rabies); bloodwork (heartworm test); deworm and deflea; spay or neuter; vet exam.

On walks, Esperanza loves to feel and smell the fresh air, and finds so much joy in seeing and meeting new people. Esperanza is learning how to play with a variety of toys, and she loves to play fetch and puzzle games. Esperanza is exceptionally smart, and she is always eager to learn more fun games, as long as it means she gets to spend quality time with you. Esperanza's joyful and happy personality bursts through the walls when it's time for breakfast or dinner. She will dance for her food on her hind legs, fold her paws like a pterodactyl, and then patiently wait for you once you put her bowl of food down, to say 'wait. You will see her drooling after about 10 seconds of waiting. As much energy as Esperanza can have at moments, she's a pro at hanging out on the couch and cuddling under the blankets (especially underneath the blanket) with you watching a movie or TV. You should fully expect to share your movie popcorn with Esperanza, she loves to catch the popcorn when you toss them in the air. Esperanza would be a great addition to a family with no pets, or to someone who is looking for a pet as a companion. Esperanza has so much love to give, but would prefer to be the solo pet in the house. Esperanza would love to meet you and accompany you on a walk to show you how easy she is to please! Come meet her today!",

I am from a litter of 10. \n\nOne of my favorite things to do is to cuddle up in my foster mom's neck when she picks me up. I like to play with my brothers and sisters, but I like my alone time as well. When I am tired, I like to go crawl into bed and take a nice long nap. I am not potty trained yet but am learning to use my potty-training pads. \n\nI cannot wait to meet you so I can go to my furever home!\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nAll our Warrior Dogs will have all age appropriate medical care and vaccines, a microchip, and spay/neuter before adoption unless age is a factor with a puppy younger than 6-12 months at the time of adoption. If that is the case, the spay/neuter will be covered in the adoption fee and the owner will be responsible to have the procedure completed at a Warrior Dog Rescue Veterinarian at the appropriate time.\n\nPlease note that the majority of our dogs in rescue are from shelters where they have been found as strays or abandoned. Their breed description is based on our very best educated guess based on physical characteristics and their dispositions. If they came to our rescue as an owner surrender, the breed description will be listed as provided by the previous owner.\n\nAdoption Fee - $525\n\nTo apply for this pup, please submit an Adoption Application at http://warriordogrescue.com/adopt/adoption-application/",

He will be your best friend if you need one! Murphy plays well with everyone at the rescue regardless of size. If you'd like to apply to adopt Murphy, please log onto our website at www.scarpr.org and click on How to Adopt. His adoption fee is $425 which includes vaccinations, sterilization and transportation off the island. Due to flight limitations, we are only able to consider applications in the upper east coast or Minnesota in an effort to coordinate with our support teams.

She is a typical beagle girl...loves to go exploring outside and will stay out there with nose to ground exploring and checking her yard out until she is ready to come back in.  She is kennel trained, loves a dog bed, likes other dogs, loves loves loves her treats and meals, and absolutely loves everyone she meets...she has never met a stranger.  She does love to be in a lap and does love to snuggle in the bed if you put her on the bed with you.  She is very sweet and polite and is very laid back and calm.  She was skinny and heartworm positive when we got her.  It was hard to tell how old she was, but our guess is approx 6 to 8 yrs old.  ZuZu has to have a secure fence and as you know...a beagle always needs to be on a leash when not in a fenced area because her beagle instinct tells her to go explore and smell everything out there.\n\n$150 adoption fee, spayed/neutered, microchipped, current vaccinations, and  kennel trained.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION: If you are interested in this pet you must fill out the Adoption Application\u2026which you can find on this site or you can copy and paste this link \u2026 http://www.marlcares.org/adopt_app-dog.php\nThis does not obligate you in any way. If this does not work for you then you can email us at midsouthpets@aol.com for one.\n\nPLEASE DO NOT CONTACT US BEFORE READING THE FOLLOWING INFO:  \nYour inquiry may not get a reply if you have not read the info we have taken the time to provide.  PLEASE READ about our ADOPTION PROCESS AND REQUIREMENTS provided on this site before contacting us.  You can find it quickly by clicking on our NAME or MORE ABOUT US in the column to the right of this pet\u2019s description.  All your questions can be answered by reading the following info provided below.  Our pets are fostered in the Memphis Area, a tri-state area, TN/AR/MS.  Most are fostered in Red Banks, MS.  \n\nWe do not allow meetings with any of our dogs until we have your Adoption Application.  Adopting a new family member should involve a well-thought out and deliberate process. This is not an impulse purchase. Please understand that we do not want these animals to be homeless again. We try to complete the process as quickly as possible and appreciate all the applications and will consider each and every one we receive. \n\nFilling out the Adoption Application does not obligate you in any way, but simply tells us a little bit about you and whether you and this pet would be a good fit for each other.  We will call you after we receive your application and answer all your questions and talk to you about this pet.  After being approved, we will set up a time to bring the pet to meet you and your family and pets or set up a time for you to meet the pet at the foster home.\n\nNO PHONE CALLS PLEASE.  Rescue is a full time job every day.  Please know because we are so very busy with the dogs along with processing applications, updating webpage\u2019s, rescuing, in many vet appointments, caring for seniors and hospice dogs, etc, etc that we are not able to return phone calls or emails asking if this dog is still adoptable, how much is it to adopt, is it house trained etc\u2026We have included all the info we have on this dog at this current time and update the bio as we learn more about them.  We kennel train all the dogs and will indicate if there are housebreaking issues that we have discovered.  We update our site regularly so if the dog is listed here they are in fact adoptable, but may have applications coming in on them, so if you are interested, you need to get your application in now.\n\n**WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE ANY ADOPTION**  Our first concern is the happiness and welfare of the animal.  We respect our potential adoptors and appreciate your interest in adopting one of our pets.  We care about you too and that you are getting the right fit for your home and lifestyle.  By following our process, together we can make sure you are getting the right pet.**\n\nNOTE: We prefer to adopt in the Mid-South AREA, usually no more than 1-2 hours away in driving distance. It is up to the foster home, how far they are willing to drive. We rarely adopt long distance, but will consider each and every application. \n \nMidSouth Animal Rescue League is an all breed, 501c3, non-profit organization that prefer to rescue senior dogs and special cases.  WE LOVE ROTTWEILERS...With 20 years of experience with our beloved ROTTWEILER breed, and little help for this breed in our area, we try to focus on rescuing them and try not to ever have to turn any away that need us\u2026especially the seniors that end up in shelters.  Currently, we have several senior rottweilers in our hospice foster program.  We always need more fosters so that we never have to say NO to them or other seniors.  \n\nWe have also started a community relief effort specifically in the Red Banks, MS area not far from us, called The Dog House Project, where we go door to door providing dog houses to dogs on chains and other dogs and cats without proper shelter, including straw in cold temps, as well as food and other supplies as needed.   We offer free spay/neuter services to those animals and continue to check on them all year.  To date many have been spayed and neutered and some have been surrendered from their neglected lives on chains.  We are making a difference and need your donations to continue this program.  We always need igloo type dog houses.  \n\nMidSouth Animal Rescue League relies on the kindness, generosity, and financial support of people like you so that we can continue to rescue and care for dogs like this one. We are a group of dedicated volunteers who respond to animals in need in shelters, strays, and from individuals. We receive no federal or state funds and are supported solely by private donations. \n\nMany of the animals we save are in need of special medical care or surgery to bring them back to health before they can be placed. Veterinary care, vaccinations, tests, x-rays, medications, spay and neutering, heartworm prevention, flea/tick prevention, worming, food, kennels, grooming, and other supplies are provided for each dog while in our care. \n\n",

There was no way she would allow us to rescue them all that day.  A week later, we tried again and she slowly walked up to Bonnie and laid her head gently in her lap...seemingly letting trust overcome fear. What we would learn later is that there were only four puppies remaining. Life on the streets is cruel and uncertain...she took fate in her hands and changed their destiny in that moment. Once saved, Pandora showed us her sweet and playful side. She gets along with all dogs and is more on the submissive side. She's a sweetheart and we can't wait to give her the life she so richly deserves. If you'd like to apply to adopt Pandora, please log onto our website at www.scarpr.org and click on How to Adopt. Her adoption fee is $425 which includes her sterilization, vaccinations and transportation off the island of Puerto Rico. Due to flight limitation, we are only able to work with our sister shelters in the upper east coast or Minnesota. We hope to resume private adoptions in the future, thank you for your understanding and support.",

She's timid of strangers at first but after some gentle pets you will have her whole heart! She's friendly with dogs and loves children but hasn't been cat tested. She knows basic commands like sit, come, leave it, load up, down, and is still working on 'no jumping'. She is house and crate trained but still needs to practice being home alone because gets very attached and wants to be wherever her humans are! Lani's ideal home would be one where she gets lots of individual attention and isn't home alone for more than 4 hours per day. She would love to have some kids to play with and follow around but would also be happy with an adult family.",

I am a shy, sensitive little guy. I am looking for a home with a lot of patience, dog experience and willing to let me find a soft place to land.\n\nI have been relaxing and learning to be a dog at my foster mom's home. She said I have learned to trust her and I have been coming up for lap time and wanting love. I have been having fun playing with the dogs here. I really want a home with a dog friend who can show me the ins and outs of dogdom. I am working on my housebreaking skills, and need to be helped with that. No one spent much time with me but since coming to foster care I am really coming along. No young children please ( older children welcome)- they can move quickly and I am still gaining my confidence. I need a fenced yard for play time. In the house for bedtime I am used to being in an X pen, so I am a good little guy. I really am loving and will make the right person a best friend.\n\nInterested adopters should complete the NCPR Adoption Interest Form. An adoption counselor will contact you. We only adopt our dogs to families in Northern California. Thank you for your interest.\n\nA Poodle's Best Friend Since 1985\n1/31/21 1:57 PM",

He loves long walks, and runs, being close to family, and cuddling to no end. True to his Great Dane roots, he's a gentle giant who can usually be found sleeping on the nearest bed or couch as your most loyal companion. He's great with commands (run, sit, stay, paw), being in the car, and being on the leash.\n\nOther dogs and cats make him nervous, and he loves kids who are older (5+) that can play with a bigger pup. Prefers lots of space for limitless play!\n\nFor additional information, please email geetosco@gmail.com.",

He is the sweetest, most cuddly boy. He needs to be the only pet in the household (he does not like other dogs or cats!!) and would do best in an adult only household. \n\nGeorgee loves car rides, walks well on leash and loves to cuddle.

            "description": "There will only be sunny skies in your future with one of the Cloudy pups at your side! Meet Look no further than this extra cute litter of Shepherd and Terrier mixes. They are around 2 months old and ready for families of their own to run, jump, and play with. We don't know who dad is or what these puppies are mixed with but they sure are cute! Their sweet mama, Cloudy, is on the medium to large side at 45 to 50 lbs. and we expect her pups to be similar in size. Stratus is looking for a family that understands the time, patience, and energy needed to raise a young pup. We require all puppy adopters to provide training that includes: house training, basic training, leash training, and socialization. Additionally, this cutie is going to need proper exercise, mental stimulation, and your attention and love to grow up to be the best companion. We do not allow our dogs or puppies to sleep or live outside; they must be incorporated into your family and be made a priority in your life. In return, you will have the most loving and loyal family member you could ask for. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting a puppy, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! Please note that processing time for applications is currently three to four weeks. We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs. Thank you for rescuing.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue. Please take a moment and go to www.labsandmore.org and click on Adopt to complete our online dog adoption application. If you have any questions email us at doginfo@labsandmore.org or call us at 858-273-5386. Thank you for looking to a rescue group to fulfill your dream of adding a new dog to your life!

Solidly built and strong as an ox, this burly guy is shy at first, but winds up fast. Midnight, lively and friendly, is fun to be with and loves treats. He'll benefit with some guidance on manners. Midnight's adoption fee is $150. He's altered, current on shots, wormed, microhipped and treated with monthly heart worm, flea and tick preventive.

            "description": "Please Note ** THIS DOG IS LOCATED IN SOUTHERN VIRGINIA. ADOPTERS MUST BE WILLING TO TRAVEL TO MEET AND ADOPT.\n\n C-Me is a 7 year old, spayed, female westie. She is healthy, up to date on her vaccines, and on heartworm preventive year round. \nShe is sweet, outgoing, and friendly. She is crate trained, housebroken and uses a doggie door. If you have a different situation than that, she may need a little time and training to adjust.\nShe will need a refresher course on leash walking as she is a country dog and it has been a few years since she has needed to walk on a leash. She was shown when she was younger and was good at that time.\n\nShe has never had to climb stairs in her environment, so will need to be taught this is her new home, if needed. With time and patience, she will learn this quickly as she is very smart.\nShe is very cooperative for grooming, bathing ,nail trims, etc.\nShe will listen, but is still a terrier, and does have selective hearing at times.\nShe can get very bossy and will be dominant with same size female dogs. She will only tolerate them for so long then asserts herself making sure they know she is the Queen. Because of this she will NOT be adopted to a home with another female dog or ANY dog smaller than her.\nWe are also looking for a fenced yard.\nThis is NOT an apartment /condo /city dog. \nShe has always lived in a quiet farm setting and has had room to run and play.\nShe likes her toys and loves her people. She wants to be with her people, following them around or laying on her favorite bed in the same room.\nThis is a referral listing to help find C-Me a great new home. Her adopter will be chosen by her owner from applicants we forward. Please contact Erica Cerny at ecerny@optonline.net or 973-361-6790 if you have interest in her or questions to see if you might be a good match for each other.  Her adoption fee is $450, and an adoption application and contract would need to be completed. East coast ONLY. \nIf you have the time and love for a new best, C-me might be the westie you\u2019ve been waiting for!\n",

            "description": "Friends to the Forlorn\nAdopt-a-BullABOUT HARLEM\n\nHarlem is the perfect lap dog for someone looking for a good nap companion! He loves to curl up and snuggle. For the most part, he is very laid back, but gets the zoomies every now and then - which is super cute. He loves to chase balls and is happy to lay down and chew on his kong. He does great with his harness and walks well with the leash - he loves to go on walks! He is housetrained and does well with whining at the back door when he needs to go out. We are still working on the crate training. He is easily coaxed to get in it with a treat and only barks for a few moments before settling down.\n\nHarlem does have something known as reactive aggression with other dogs. He would need to be an only dog or a companion to someone with a very submissive dog. He does well with his foster brothers, who are very submissive, so he could be tested depending on the companion. He is easily triggered by hyperactivity and will growl/snap with toys, treats and his food. Knowing this, he would do well in a home with older kids, as he gets startled by lots of commotion and loud noises. He can also get a bit nippy when he is excited.\n\nHarlem was an owner-surrender due to his ongoing allergies. When he came to us, his skin was red and irritated, he had eye and ear infections, and severely overgrown toenails. The skin infection has left him hairless on his chest and belly. We are treating him with medications, special diet, and weekly medicated baths - and is doing amazing. He is even already starting to show some hair growth back on his chest and belly! He will most likely need to continue allergy medication and a special diet for the remainder of his life in order to keep his skin in check.\n\nHe is also intact and has various mammary growths. He will need to be neutered once his skin clears up. The vet will also check his growths at that time to determine if they are cancerous or benign.www.savingpitbulls.org",

            "description": "Meet Sugar!\n\n13 year old Sugar was brought in to the Orange County shelter as a stray. We got an email that this little 8 lb. cutie needed a rescue commitment quickly, so one of our volunteers went to get her on January 19th.\n\nWe vetted Sugar the next day. Our vet's first comment was that she is a very sweet girl! With a name like Sugar how could she not be? She is missing many teeth and has moderate calculus on the remaining teeth. She has two palpable mammary masses that we will be removing. She has a large mass on her left side. X-rays show that it's an abdominal hernia and her intestines are in it. The hernia is likely from a previous trauma. We will be surgically correcting this at the same time she has her mammary masses removed.\n\nSugar has the cutest full body wiggle when you talk to her. She acts like she wants to come over for pets and then runs away, like a \"come catch me\" kind of playful game. Once you catch her she loves to be held and will quickly fall asleep in your arms.\n\nThis sweet ball of sugar and spice is on a 2-week Frosted Fling! We can't wait to learn how she does in a home environment. Check back soon for an update!\n\nVisit us at Open House: Saturdays & Sundays, 10 am - 1 pm.\n\nLearn more about our programs at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family. No adoption fees, and we help with medical costs!\n\nBecome a family: www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\nUpdated: 1/31/21 KG",

Meet Look no further than this extra cute litter of Shepherd and possibly Terrier mixes. They are around 2 months old and ready for families of their own to run, jump, and play with. We don't know who dad is or what these puppies are mixed with but they sure are cute! Their sweet mama, Cloudy, is on the medium to large side at 45 to 50 lbs. and we expect her pups to be similar in size. Kelvin is looking for a family that understands the time, patience, and energy needed to raise a young pup. We require all puppy adopters to provide training that includes: house training, basic training, leash training, and socialization. Additionally, this cutie is going to need proper exercise, mental stimulation, and your attention and love to grow up to be the best companion. We do not allow our dogs or puppies to sleep or live outside; they must be incorporated into your family and be made a priority in your life. In return, you will have the most loving and loyal family member you could ask for. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting a puppy, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! Please note that processing time for applications is currently three to four weeks. We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs.

Meet Look no further than this extra cute litter of Shepherd and possibly Terrier mixes. They are around 2 months old and ready for families of their own to run, jump, and play with. We don't know who dad is or what these puppies are mixed with but they sure are cute! Their sweet mama, Cloudy, is on the medium to large side at 45 to 50 lbs. and we expect her pups to be similar in size. Cumulus is looking for a family that understands the time, patience, and energy needed to raise a young pup. We require all puppy adopters to provide training that includes: house training, basic training, leash training, and socialization. Additionally, this cutie is going to need proper exercise, mental stimulation, and your attention and love to grow up to be the best companion. We do not allow our dogs or puppies to sleep or live outside; they must be incorporated into your family and be made a priority in your life. In return, you will have the most loving and loyal family member you could ask for. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting a puppy, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! Please note that processing time for applications is currently three to four weeks. We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs.

Meet Look no further than this extra cute litter of Shepherd and possibly Terrier mixes. They are around 2 months old and ready for families of their own to run, jump, and play with. We don't know who dad is or what these puppies are mixed with but they sure are cute! Their sweet mama, Cloudy, is on the medium to large side at 45 to 50 lbs. and we expect her pups to be similar in size. Alto is looking for a family that understands the time, patience, and energy needed to raise a young pup. We require all puppy adopters to provide training that includes: house training, basic training, leash training, and socialization. Additionally, this cutie is going to need proper exercise, mental stimulation, and your attention and love to grow up to be the best companion. We do not allow our dogs or puppies to sleep or live outside; they must be incorporated into your family and be made a priority in your life. In return, you will have the most loving and loyal family member you could ask for. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting a puppy, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! Please note that processing time for applications is currently three to four weeks. We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs.

            "description": "There will only be sunny skies in your future with one of the Cloudy pups at your side! Meet Look no further than this extra cute litter of Shepherd and possibly Terrier mixes. They are around 2 months old and ready for families of their own to run, jump, and play with. We don't know who dad is or what these puppies are mixed with but they sure are cute! Their sweet mama, Cloudy, is on the medium to large side at 45 to 50 lbs. and we expect her pups to be similar in size. Nimbo is looking for a family that understands the time, patience, and energy needed to raise a young pup. We require all puppy adopters to provide training that includes: house training, basic training, leash training, and socialization. Additionally, this cutie is going to need proper exercise, mental stimulation, and your attention and love to grow up to be the best companion. We do not allow our dogs or puppies to sleep or live outside; they must be incorporated into your family and be made a priority in your life. In return, you will have the most loving and loyal family member you could ask for. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting a puppy, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! Please note that processing time for applications is currently three to four weeks. We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs. Thank you for rescuing.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue. Please take a moment and go to www.labsandmore.org and click on Adopt to complete our online dog adoption application. If you have any questions email us at doginfo@labsandmore.org or call us at 858-273-5386. Thank you for looking to a rescue group to fulfill your dream of adding a new dog to your life!

            "description": "Bud: 4-year-old black & rust male, neutered, docked tail and cropped ears. 11\", 13 lb. Fully vetted. Rescued from shelter.\n\nBud is one handsome little guy! He is an independent, and loving friend. Although he isn't a high energy dog around the house, he really enjoys his walks. He is housetrained and not big on barking. He would make a great walking partner, couch companion, or home office co-worker. He is very interested in hanging out in the kitchen patiently awaiting treats. He tends to bond strongly with one person but loves the whole family and would not mind being in a one dog home. Note: Bud is located in Sacramento County, CA and we will not fly this boy.\n\nIf you wish to adopt, please fill out our IMPS Min Pin Adoption Application\nIf you have previously submitted an Application form, there is no need to re-apply.

            "description": "NOT READY FOR HIS ROCKING CHAIR YET\n\nBenito was a little ole guy we found down at our local shelter.  He had been brought in as a stray, with a \"lady friend\" who was in season.  So don't let the cloudy eyes fool ya, Benito is young at heart and still considers himself to be a ladys man.  Well, at least he did, until he was neutered.  He still likes the ladies but they will no longer lead him astray and into trouble, like they used to.\n\nBenito is one of those, \"so ugly he's cute\" kind of guys and he has one of those personalities that grows on you.  Maybe even instills some respect for what he has probably lived through and how long he managed it before getting caught and sent to jail\n\nHe obviously has eye issues.  His left eye is sightless and atrophied, which makes it smaller than his other, mildly functioning eye, which while sighted, sees only shapes and shades.  The pressure in that eye is not alarming and steroid drops keep him comfortable but in all likelihood, he will be 100% blind before too long.   Not to worry though.  He has learned to compensate and even with his limited sight, enjoys exploring his surroundings and is quite confident and secure in his wanderings and adventures.  For this reason, a very secure fence will be necessary.\n\nBenito also developed some ear polyps and had horribly abscessed teeth, all of which are scheduled to be rectified on February 12th.  His hearing, though currently compromised, is still quite functional and should improve, once the polyps are no longer obstructing his ear canals.\n\nAnd that is where the medical issues end.  Everything else about this little chap is top notch.  His heart and lungs are strong and healthy and his bloodwork was excellent, so no renal issues either.  He is growing back some patchy hair loss, attributed to flea dermatitis and is just a dapper little whiskery faced guy, looking for someone to help him find his way and provide him with understanding, love and enrichment.  \n\nBecause he is an older dude and lived his life, pretty much any way he wanted to, we are not recommending a home where small children are around with any frequency.  His sight issues can cause him to react defensively and his age can cause him to grump and grouse, if he is not treated gently and respectfully.   He would love a yard he could sun himself in, in the spring and summer and explore all year round.  He loves to sit on a nice warm lap, chase the vacuum cleaner, eat soft treats and just hang out, enjoying life and living.  He is a pretty quiet guy, crates well, enjoys car rides but his potty skills require some understanding and a schedule.   He prefers to go outside but if you don't get him there, has no problem with rewarding your inattention with a clean up job.  In his foster home, they have him wear belly bands when he can't be watched and that seems to work out well.\n\nBenito is probably at least 10 years old and more likely closer to 12+.  He is small, no more than nine inches at the shoulder, and built solid, so weighs more than it appears he should.  He has a cute little strut but walks on a leash must go slowly until he is familiar with the terrain and topography.  He is not particularly affectionate but does enjoy a good lap for napping and would appreciate the warmth of a human body at night, if his new person were so inclined.  He carries himself in the manner of a dog who has known little human affection but could learn to like it, if the bubble of his dignity can be respected.\n\nIf you would like to bring this dignified little character into your home and help his sunset chapters be filled with happy, warm, garden style adventures, please go to our website at www.allmuttsgreatandsmall.org/adoption and submit an adoption application. We would love to hear what inspired you to consider bringing this fella into your life and how you plan to make his life the best he's had yet.\n\nBenito is neutered, microchipped, up to date on five way, bordatella and rabies vaccinations, is flea and parasite free and will be ready for his new home, after his dental and ear surgery on February 12, 2021\n\nHis adoption fee is $150, \n\nPlease note:\n\n*Inquiries submitted through Petfinder, are not the same as applications \n  submitted through our webpage.  \n*Yes we do out of state adoptions.\n*No, we do not transport. You must be willing to come and meet the dog and \n  take it home with you.\n*Yes we do Canadian adoptions.\n*If the dog is on Petfinder, it is still available.\n*You must be 18 years of age to adopt\n*If you submit questions about an adoptable dog, covered in the Petfinder bio, \n we will not respond.\n*We do not pick the first good application.  We pick the most suitable \n  application for the dog, out of all submitted.\n*All correspondence is handled via email as time allows.  \n* If you are not chosen, you will not be notified\n\nFor a more detailed explanation of our adoption process, go to www.allmuttsgreatandsmall.org/adoption and read \"The Adoption Process\" link",

She will need special attention to her leash manners and general socialization. \n\nShe is potty trained and will whine to let her foster mom know she needs to go outside. She is crate trained and absolutely loves her crate. She is very gentle when taking treats and doesn't mind when humans or her dog foster brother borrow her toys. \n\nFig knows sit, down, paw, come and kennel. Fig is cheese motivated and would love to continue learning. Fig walks nicely on leash and shows appropriate interest and excitement when seeing other dogs. \n\nFig has met one toddler and was very polite. She took treats gently and allowed for pets. She has been sweet and wiggly when meeting all different types of people. \n\nFig currently lives in an apartment with another large male dog and politely greets and coexists with him. Fig doesn't seem to mind the noisy neighbors that come with living in an apartment, and the hustle and bustle of the city doesn't bother her. \n\nFig loves car rides, snuggling up in  pile of blankets, taking strolls around the neighborhood and naps in the sun.\n\nIf you're looking for an independent dog that is up to go hiking but also loves to have a lazy movie marathon, Fig is your girl.

            "description": "Fern is an adorable little Chihuahua mix who was brought to the rescue after the owner's dog had and accidental litter. We made sure mama got spayed so no more puppies would be at risk as these owners had no idea what to do with them. Fern had 3 siblings and they are all vaccinated, altered and ready for forever homes. These puppies are playful and rambunctious little characters with lots of curiosity and smarts. All are currently around 3-4 lbs at nearly 3 months and we estimate they will all be 10-12 lbs full grown. They are typical mischievous puppies that will require loads of love and thoughtful training. They have learned a great deal by spending a little extra time with their siblings as all puppies should. They are currently sleeping in a pen together at night and go outside for playtime throughout the day. They are just learning about leashes and collars but will be walking like pros in no time. The perfect home for these babies would be with another dog similar to their grown size although they can thrive without other dogs in the home. Due to their small size they would do best in a home with older children over the age of 10. \n\nFern is a short coated breed who will shed some. She will require regular brushing and occasional nail trims. \n\nFern's adoption fee is $325\n\nThis fee includes at least one health exam at our veterinarian while in our care, altering, all vaccinations including rabies (as permitted by age), a pre-adoption professional grooming and a microchip with lifetime membership that never will cost you a fee. \n All dogs also leave with a new collar and or harness and leash as well as a gift bag which includes among other things, a starter bag of the quality kibble that is being fed at the rescue.\nAdoption fees also allow us the ability to put funds towards the next homeless or unwanted dog in need of rescue!\n\nIf you'd like to considered to for this adoption or any of our amazing rescues, please fill our the application with the help of this link. https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/AZST/Dog.\n\nWe review each application carefully. Please understand that sometimes we get numerous applications for particular dogs and as a volunteer based rescue we do not always have the time to respond to each and every one. We do our best to choose the most suitable home for each dog based on their specific personality and needs. \n\nDue to Covid, we are very short handed and may not contact you for up to a week to set up a meet and greet if your application is chosen. We appreciate all applicants and do our best to pair ever dog and family for a successful and happy life.",

We gave him lots of love and attention and he is completely healthy and very well adjusted.  He came into his own at about 70lbs now!  He has all his hair and his \"zipper\" became very prominent when it did.  He is so loving and gentle and gets along well with all dogs big and small.  He especially loves the little ones!\nMeo is a super companion for someone looking for a sweet, gently, loving boy who gives back more than he gets.\n\nHe is deserving of a happy home!  He is well adjusted and would be a great companion.",

She needs someone who can match her energy and keep her mind stimulated. She can\u2019t be trusted off leash unless in a fenced area. She is currently in a foster home with other dogs but is selective about which dogs she likes, both male and female. She does not need to be in a home with small animals. She has been around older kids and did fine. She can be a bit aloof and take time to warm up to you. Once she is comfortable with you, she is very playful and affectionate. She loves tennis balls and running around and playing outside. Akila is spayed, chipped, current on vaccines and monthly prevention.

He is an almost 2-year-old active, playful, happy, and curious sable and white sheltie who is affectionate and who will serenade you with music from his squeaky toys. He appears to be housetrained and walks on a leash but needs practice. Pete would do best in a home without other dogs or with a young active female dog to play with. He is a special needs pup. He has a genetic condition Dermatomyositis (DMS) which is not curable but is treatable with an inexpensive daily medication. This condition varies in severity depending on the individual dog. Best case scenario is minor, barely noticeable facial lesions and worst case is very noticeable facial lesions and muscle weakness. Pete has moderate symptoms with visible facial lesions but no indication of any muscle weakness. He runs and plays like any sheltie his age and is thankfully unaware of his condition. He has a pleasant happy expression, and we think he is beautiful despite the scars on his face. For more information on Dermatomyositis see the following links. https://www.americanshetlandsheepdogassociation.org/dermatomyositis/ Dermatomyositis studies website (This web site hasn't been updated for several years but the pictures and information is relevant) Pete will be placed with a sheltie savvy adopter who can monitor his condition and work with his or her vet if necessary. 2/1/21 6:16 PM",

            "description": "Thank you for considering a homeless/rescue dog, it does not matter where dogs are from what matters is where they will live the rest of their life. \n\nMy name is Raina this is my story it has a sad beginning and a happy ending.  I was a stray wandering a rural neighborhood there were two very friendly ladies who helped me with my puppies.  I had two cute puppies; the nice ladies contacted a rescue group that found good homes for my family.  I was homeless for a long time, I was isolated and alienated from people, no home, no loving hands to hold me, no socialization, I am a little shy on first encounters but with a treat I will follow you anywhere, I do like people but because I am fearful, shy and timid it takes a little time to show you I enjoyed the treat and pat on the head.  The kind ladies cared for me providing food and water where I felt safe at an abandoned house is where I laid my head at night.  They were very patient trying to befriend me, over time I felt comfortable enough for a belly rub and a hug.  I was then, saved.\n\nThis is my story; I am Raina\u2019s foster mom.\nI am a volunteer foster mom with Paws & Claws Rescue, Raina came into my care on October 26, 2020 today she is a different dog very sweet, loving, affectionate and completely trusting.  She loves a serious belly rub; she jumps up for a hug.  Only a few weeks ago she would not walk with a harness and lead, now she enjoys her walks, runs back to me for a treat after each time she relieves herself, a 100% progress.  She is crate trained sleeps in her large wire crate at night & potty trained, she\u2019s very smart and learns quickly, she sits for her treat and food this progress she has learned this in my care, again, she learns quickly. \n\nRaina is ready to join a quiet loving patient family, she\u2019s the full package a sincere sweet personality, sweet natured, frisky she likes to run and play, likes everyone she meets but will be timid & shy upon first encounters to new people. \n\nRaina is 60 pounds of love; she was thin now she\u2019s fit and sassy. Raina is  Anatolian Shepherd/Great Pyrenees mix?  It is difficult to identify mixed breed dogs without proper knowledge of ancestry; a guess assessment of breed and age has been made. Both breeds are basically considered good family pets, loyal, devoted and true to their family. \n\nRaina is approximately 2 years old still very young she enjoys sitting on her dog house when outdoors. She is waiting for someone to make her dream come true with toys of her own, big comfy bed, and a home with a family that will shower her with love and attention. Raina has loving eyes that invite you in with a pleading expression \u201cplease open your heart and home give her a chance to prove her love\u201d.\n\nShe needs a family who will love, walk, play and care for her.  She needs a forever home where she can hang her leash and call \u201cHome, Sweet Home\u201d. Raina will enjoy a quiet home. I am looking for a nice fenced yard where she can run and play.  Again, an extremely patient family showing much dedication to help with Raina\u2019s progress.  The process maybe slow but the out-come is gaining her love and trust.  Raina loves to walk we walk in the woods on a path where she can enjoy all the different smells and odors of the woods.  We do not walk on city streets vehicle noise may make her nervous and anxious?  Raina walks by my side, no pulling or tugging she is a great walking partner.  It\u2019s important to have a supply of tasty treats on our walk, Raina sits without a command, she loves her treats.      \n\nRaina\u2019s adoption donation is $150.00 which includes all her expenses and vetting, etc.  She is current on vaccinations; monthly flea & tick & heartworm preventative. She has been micro chipped and spayed ready for her new home. If you would like additional information and an adoption application, please contact his foster mom Delia at rubsch@sbcglobal.net and please include your phone number.  \n\nRescue dogs form a lifelong bond with their families and are forever grateful for their new happy family and life. Our rescue dogs come in all shapes, colors and sizes they love unconditionally.\n",

HE WAS ALWAYS FRIENDLY WITH NEW PEOPLE AND HE MET PLENTY OBN HIS TRAVELS AROUND HIS NEIGHBORHOOD. PROBLEM IS, NO ONE KNEW WHERE HIS HOME WAS & WHEN HE ENDED UP IN OUR RESCUE AS A STRAY WE WERE ABLE TO FIND HIS OWNER AND RETURN HIM. AFTER A COUPLE OF WEEKS HE WAS PICKED UP AS A STRAY AGAIN & OUR RESCUE WAS CALLED. THIS TIME HIS OWNER AGREED TO SURRENDER HIM SO HE COULD FIND A HOME AND BE PART OF A FAMILY FOR REAL THIS TIME. AND THAT'S ALL CROSBY WANTS...A FAMILY...SOME LOVE....SOME TREATS...SOME NAPS....SOME PLAY TIME...AND SOME PATIENCE& SOME UNDERSTANDING. CROSBY HAS TURNED INTO A REAL PET WHILE IN FOSTER CARE. HE LIKES THE ROUTINE AND THE SECURITY. HE IS SELECTIVE ABOUT WHO HIS FRIENDS ARE AND DOESN;T TAKE TO JUST ANY OLD DOG THAT WANTS TO BE BUDDIES. \nCROSBY WANTS A HOME TO CALL HIS OWN. HE WANTS CONSISTANT LOVE AND ATTENTION. NOT CONSTANT! JUST SOMEONE HE CAN COUNT ON. HE HAS GOTTIN BETTER ON A LEASH AND WILL ONLY PULL WHEN FIRST GETTING OUT OF HIS KENNEL AND BEING WALKED OUTSIDE. HE GETS PRETTY EXCITED TO GO OUT AND PEE WHEN HE WAKES UP. THEN HE WILL CALM DOWN. A FENCED IN YARD WOULD MAKE EVEYONES LIFE EASIER BUT IT'S NOT MANDATORY. HE LIKES TOYS AND HE WILL GET AROUND TO TEARING THEM UP JUST LIKE ANY GOOFY DOG WILL DO, BUT HE'S NOT DESTRUCTIVE. HE HAS NOT BEEN AROUND CHILDREN AND HAS NOT BEEN TESTED WITH THEM. HE HAS NOT BEEN TESTED WITH CATS. \nCROSBY IS NEUTERED, UP TO DATE ON VACCINES AND HEART WORM NEGATIVE. HE IS MICROCHIPPED.LOCATED IN CROSSVILLE, CUMBERLAND COUNTY, TN.

HE HAS A VERY TYPICAL GREAT DANE PERSONALITY...AFFECTIONATE AND SWEET;HE TRIES TO BACK UP AND SITON YOUR LAP;HE PUTS HIS FRONT P ON YOUR LAP AND STANDS ON HIS BACK FEET AND TOWERS OVER YOU TO BE PETTED; AND HE STANDS NEXT TO YOU AND LEANS. HE NEEDS SOME TRAINING BUT HE IS HIGHLY FOOD MOTIVATED AND REALLY WANTS TO PLEASE. THERE WERE OUTSIDE CATS AT HIS PREVIOUS HOME AND THEY WOULD OFTEN COME CLOSE AND WE WERE TOLD HE NEVER OFFERED TO BOTHER ANY OF THEM. THERE WERE ALSO YOUNG CHILDREN IN THE HOUSE AND HE WOULDN'T DARE HURT ONE ON PURPOSE. HOWEVER HE HAS NO IDEA OF HIS SIZE AND CAN BE A JUMPER WHEN HE IS EXCITED TO SEE YOU. HIS FOSTER FEELS LIKE HE WOULD DO BEST IF ANY CHILDREN IN THE HOME WHERE OLDER. CAM IS NOT LEASH TRAINED AND IS DIFFICULT TO WALK. HE CAN BE TAUGHT OF COURSE WITH A GENTLE LEADER HARNESS AND SOME TIME AND TREATS. BUT WE FEEL CAM WOULD BEST BE PLACED IN A HOME WITH A TALL FENCE. HE NEEDS TO PLAY OFF LEASH TO BURN OFF ENERGY. A TIRED GREAT DANE IS A GOOD GREAT DANE. CAM DOES WELL INSIDE. HE HAS TAKEN TO HIS KENNEL (IT'S A 5'X5' WALK IN KENNEL). HE HAS ALSO TAKEN TO HIS ELEVATED BED BUT RECENTLY TORE APART A FIBER FILLED BLANKET THAT WAS PUT ON HIS BED IN HIS KENNEL. HIS FOSTER DOESN'T REALLY BLAME HIM. HE WAS LEFT IN THE KENNEL TOO LONG WITH NO ENRICHMENT TOYS TO OCCUPY HIM AND PROBABLY GOT BORED. CAM WON'T BE THE EASIEST DOG AT FIRST. HE NEEDS TO LEARN SOME MANNERS. BUTHE COULD TEACH CLASSES ON HOW SWEET AND FUNNY A DOG CAN BE AND HE IS SO WORTH THE TIME AND EFFFORT TO TRAIN HIM. HE SEEMS TO BE KENNEL TRAINED AS LONG AS HE ISN'T LEFT IN THE KENNEL TOO LONG WITHOUT BEING LET OUT. HIS FOSTER THINKS HE WOULD DO GREAT IN A HOME WHERE HE COULD LEARN TO GO TO THE DOOR TO BE LET OUT.CAM IS HOUSED WITH MANY DOGS AT HIS FOSTER HOME. HE HAS ONLY HAD A PROMBLEM WITH ONE OTHER MALE WHO WAS NOT YET ALTERED. HE HAS BEEN AROUND SMALL DOGS LARGE DOGS MEDIUM SIZED DOGS AND PUPPIES.CAM IS NEUTERED UP TO DATE ON VACCINES AND MICROCHIPPED.

Puppies need training and supervision. He is comfortable in the crate, indicates when he needs to go potty. He does require a home with another dog as he draws his confidence from them. He will play with toys if he has another dog to play with, otherwise he will chew a bone and work for treats when one on one.Odie is apprehensive of men, so an understanding household that will work with him/ understand his fear or an all female home would be necessary. He will need one visit our vet in Golden Valley, and then will be able to be adopted. So preference will go to someone who is willing to foster to adopt until vetting can be complete.

I have been with my current foster since November and we have slowly nursed me back to health despite many setbacks. I went through lots of painful surgeries and nearly lost my leg. However, I am a fighter and today I am doing great and running like a champ. I have spent a lot of down time healing so now that I can run, I have a lot of energy. I love to have your full attention. I am the sweetest boy and get along well with my fosters other 2 dogs. I have been around lots of people as my foster has a home salon and I have been the welcoming committee.\n\nMy ideal family is one that will allow me to be part of the family and not just an outside dog. I have never had an accident inside, I am crate trained but don't require one. I love to eat and have gained my COVID 15 lbs. I was painfully thin for a long time.\n\nI would make a great addition to a home with or without another pet. Please consider me for your family as I deserve the best life. I promise I would give all of the love and kisses you could handle. If you are interested in adopting Sampson, please fill out an application at royalanimalrefuge.org/adopt <3",

She is a Border Collie/Great Pyrenees mix, she is 5 months old and she weighs 35 pounds.  Bella has a full black and white coat with super cute freckles and a full tail.  She is housebroken and crate-trained.  Bella is a very smart little girl and she is quickly learning her basic obedience commands.  She rides pretty well in the car and she is making progress walking on leash with the help of a harness.\nBella loves people and is a joy to be around.  She is a higher energy, higher Velcro dog who loves to play and then settles nicely when playtime is over!  Bella also loves other dogs, and she loves a good game of chase or tug of war with her dog pal.  Bella is a cat-chaser.\nThe ideal home for Bella is one that includes an active, fun-loving family who is ready for a fun and funny young girl.  A fenced yard and another playful young dog are important, children over the age of 10 are welcome, and no cats please.  It is also important that Bella\u2019s family commit to continue her training \u2013 she has amazing potential.  If Bella is a great match for you, apply today!

He loves everyone he meets and is very friendly. \nOk with cats and kids. If there are other dogs in the home a meet and greet will need to be arranged.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting please email dogadoptions@thesanctuarypa.org to fill out an application and questionnaire.\nPlease be aware that we are all volunteers and we do not pre-approve applications nor do we hold onto applications, so please make copies of our application and questionnaire in case another application is chosen and you want to submit an application again in the future for another available dog.\n\nWe are open every Saturday to the public  from 10-2 to meet our dogs. Dog adoptions will not take place during that 10-2 timeframe and applications will only be taken on our available dogs that day. \nAlso please do not bring your own dogs during our Saturday open hours.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: At this time we are following CDC guidelines and practicing social distancing and wearing masks in our buildings \n\nHope to see you soon!!",

She is only 7 months old and weighs about 40 lbs.  \n\nShe is very shy and timid but not aggressive.  She does not walk on leash yet, she gets scared and freezes up.  We are sure she can learn with time and patience, best suited for someone that has a yard to work with her.\n\nShe loves to play with toys but doesn't want to share them with other dogs.  With people, she plays nice with toys. She is OK with children 8 years and older. \n\nHanna is learning how to give kisses, loves her food and will do anything for treats! She is not a barker, is house trained and knows how to use a doggie door.  She has been to the dog park and does very well running around with her friends.\n\nShe is spayed, up-to-date on shots and microchipped.  If you are interested in Hanna, please complete the on-line application that can be found on our website: www.adoptmerescue.org or contact us for more information.\n\n\n",

            "description": "In Foster/ 14 yrs old\n\nHi friends, my name is Jasmine! I am the newest resident at RAR. I want to share my story with you.\n\nMy mom was tragically murdered days ago. I have lost everything I have ever known. For the past 14 years, I have woken up next to my best friends, and now they are gone. I had a teenager best friend, but her world has now changed too and we were not able to stay together. I am heartbroken and grieving at a new place with so many new things that are so unfamiliar to me. This is\nvery hard. I can still get around pretty well, but at my age, I am just looking for a soft spot to land and could give me some pets. I would prefer to be the only child, but that's because that's how I have lived my entire life. Before I forget, my new friends here did tell me to hold tight that someone would be coming for me, but we have to get through some medical issues too. I was taken to the vet to do a full work up and the vet said that my bladder looks abnormal. I am on antibiotics in hopes that this is an infection that I can get through, but I do have a follow up in a week to see if I have improved. My next foster or adoptive family has to be okay with driving me to my appointments to ensure I am medically taken care of. I know it is a lot to ask for, but I have lost everything and need a purpose to continue living. Could you share this post to help me?\n\nWith love,\nJasmine\n\nIf you wish to donate towards Jasmine's medical care, please do so below. Any amount helps! If you are unable to donate, please share or comment on this post, even if it is an emoji. It will create more reach for Jasmine. We genuinely appreciate anything you can do.\n\n\n\nTo adopt please visit royalanimalrefuge.org/adopt\n\nTo foster please visit royalanimalrefuge.org/foster",

They were brought to the shelter on 1/14, and now they are both looking for new homes to claim as their own! Chantel is a beautiful, 5 year old girl with a heart of gold. She is as sweet as can be and outgoing. With all the loving she is ready to give, she still manages to stay calm and sweet. Chantel is a smart girl and knows how to sit on command. Meet Chantel and fall in love with this 51 pound sweetheart in run 46. Her ID number is 626864. Chantel is up-to-date on vaccines, and she will be spayed, microchipped, and heart worm tested upon adoption. Chantel can't wait to start loving and playing with her new family!\n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information.

Im a little over a year old and Im fully house/crate trained. I love to cuddle and be close to my human. Im not sure why they always say ouch or move over when I sit in their laps. I love kids, other dogs, bones, and being outside. I have quite a loud bark that I use often to protect the house from any noises. I know basic commands and Im trying to learn that when my humans eat I should give them space. I enjoy my fur foster sibling but I dont like when she comes close to my food or bone. \n\nHere are some snazzy things about me my foster family thinks you should know:\n- housebroken\n- crate trained\n- knows basic commands\n- good with other dogs\n- good with cats\n- good with children\n- likes to play a lot\n- loves walking\nTo adopt this dog, or any OPH dog, fill out the simple online application at https://ophrescue.org \nOperation Paws for Homes, Inc. (OPH) rescues dogs of all breeds and ages from high-kill shelters in NC, VA, MD, and SC, reducing the numbers being euthanized. With limited resources, the shelters are forced to put down 50-90% of the animals that come in the front door. OPH provides pet adoption services to families located in VA, DC, MD, PA and neighboring states. OPH is a 501(c)(3) organization and is 100% donor funded. OPH does not operate a shelter or have a physical location. We rely on foster families who open their homes to give love and attention to each dog before finding a forever home.",

            "description": "Lili / Female / 12 Years / 42 lbs / Street Mix / Toronto\n\nMeet Lili! Lili spent almost 10 years in a shelter, waiting for a family to choose her. Black dogs all over the world are often overlooked, and unfortunately Lili fell victim to this stigma. When our partner shelter in Mexico saw a publication detailing her story, they immediately went to get her out. They knew if she was given the chance - she would make an excellent addition to a lucky family. Once she was cleared to travel, she made the long trip to Canada. Lili is so deserving of a special family who will support and love her through her senior years!\n\nLili is described as spunky, confident, curious, smart, affectionate, energetic and highly trainable. They say you can\u2019t teach an old dog new tricks but Lili proves this is FALSE. She is clearly making up for lost time and lives every single day to its fullest. She can be a little bossy and demanding at times but she is responsive to leadership. She is always ready for belly rubs, food and lives for puzzles toys. She keeps surprising her foster family with her youthful zest for life!\n\nLili is a social dog but she needs proper introductions with people. She has met people in her building and in the hallways and she will generally just sniff or maintain a respectful distance. When meeting people in a stressful situation (like the vet) she may bark or snap. She is much more weary of men and may take a few days to warm up to them. Once she is given adequate time to learn proper greetings and social skills, she will likely do fine.\n\nLili is still adjusting to life as a pet and living inside a home. She needs boundaries and structure to understand humans expectations of her. Her adoptive family will have to invest time in her training to bring out the best in her. She is trusted with free reign of the home but she is crated at night time. Granted she receives enough opportunities to use the washroom, she is fully potty-trained.\n\nLili loves her walks and will need approximately 4 shorter walks throughout the day. She can be reactive to other dogs on leash and will bark and/or lunge. Given her size she can only be walked by a very strong handler. Adopters should be confident in their ability to redirect her as needed. She is highly food motivated so treats being on hand will be essential to her success. She is smart and has already learned sit, relax, wait and come!\n\nLili\u2019s ideal family would have some dog experience and understand the importance of setting boundaries for her. She doesn\u2019t like the company of other dogs so far, so she would need to be the only pet in the home. She will need adopters who are home more often than not and can support her through some mild seperation anxiety. Although she can adapt to most living environments, Lili would be happiest in a house with fully fenced backyard. She would love the opportunity to run, sniff and explore in the safety of a secure area. Lili is only looking for homes with children that are 14+.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adopting Lili please apply at https://www.fetchandreleash.ca/adoption-info#adoption-form\n\nLili\u2019s adoption fee is $420.

            "description": "Broccoli and her sister Cauliflower came to the shelter as strays and no one came for them so they are looking for their new homes. Broccoli is a sweet submissive girl who will need a home with gentle patient people. She is easily frightened and cowers at sudden movements and loud noises. She loves people and once she feels safe with you she wants nothing more than to snuggle close. She would be OK with an easy going male dog and was afraid of cats.\nUPDATE FROM FOSTER\nBroccoli is the happiest ball of energy you'll ever meet! Her favorite activities are playing fetch with her tennis ball, tug-o-war, and snuggling on the couch after a long walk. She can be a little shy around new people, but with a few treats and some pets she'll be your new best friend! She is still working on her manners, so she'll need someone willing to be patient and work with her while she's learning. We think she would be okay with dogs with a proper introduction, but seems very scared of cats. She is a sweetheart looking for a place to call her forever",

She is up to date on shots, spayed and on preventatives.\n\nDaisy is crate trained, house trained and leash trained.  She rides well in the car.  She is on the dominant side as far as personality.  She does get along with other dogs but can be bossy and she prefers to play by herself.  She loves to play ball and has some serious drive and is full of spunk.\n\nDaisy can be leery of strangers, but once she is comfortable with you, she will be a sweet and loving velcro dog to her person.  She is treat motivated and has so much potential.  \n\nDaisy is currently on crate rest after completing heartworm treatment. She is one tough girl and is doing well and showing no ill effects.\n\nIf you think this little charmer is the right fit for your family, please fill out our application:\n\nhttps://www.australianshepherdsfurever.org/adoption-application\n\nAll adoption fees are used for future rescue efforts.\n",

            "description": "Snapshot of Joy!\n\nSize?\nI'm still growing, but I bet I'll be a medium/large pup!\n\nAge?\n\n6 months\n\nActivity Level?\nI play hard and snuggle hard!\n\nNoise Level?\nNo shared walls, please.\n\nGood with Dogs?\nI would LOVE a playmate!\n\nGood with Cats?\nNo cats, please!\n\nGood with Kids?\nOlder kids only, if you please!\n\nGood with Strangers?\nI bark at first, but warm up quickly!\n\nPotty Trained?\nI'm a pro!\n\nCrate Trained?\n\nI would prefer not to be crated but with some more training I'm sure I could learn to like a crate!\n\nInterested? Learn more about Joy below!\n\nAbout Joy:\n\nHi! My name is Joy and I am a young Catahoula mix! I traveled all the way from TX to MN with my sister in search of my forever home. You would never know that I wasn't from MN though with how much I love running in the snow! I could play in it forever if it didn't cause my little paws to get cold.\n\nI currently live in a very busy house with other dogs, some cats, a few adult humans, and a couple baby humans. After taking a little bit of time to adjust, I decided that I love to have other dogs in the house! They keep me company and will play with me! I'm still learning about cats. I think I would prefer to have only dogs in my forever home though. I do fine with the little kids as well. I can be very gentle if I want to be. But sometimes I get really excited about things which can be a bit overwhelming for the littles. I think I would do best with slightly older kids that are comfortable with walking. I loooove the adults though! They give me pets and treats and toys and treats. Did I mention treats? I am super food motivated if you can't tell (:\n\nI have a lot of energy, but it's manageable! Right now I tire myself out by running around on an extra-long leash through the snow, chasing squeaky toys that my foster mom throws, or playing with puzzle toys. If I had a fenced yard that would be even better! Once I'm tired out, I like to snuggle up with whoever is around! I'm really good at finding a spot next to you on the couch, on your lap if there's minimal space, or even on your shoulder at the top of the couch if needed! I don't mind snoozing by myself on a soft surface either if all of the humans are busy.\n\nI've been through a lot of big changes in my short life that have caused me to have some anxiety when my people aren't right by me. I think my human's call is separation anxiety? But they give me meds twice a day and it really helps me chill out. Since I'm so young there's a good chance that I will be able to get off of the meds when I'm settled into my forever home. But for right now they are really helping me become comfortable in new places. Some other things that help me are having another confident dog around and not being in a kennel. I really enjoy sleeping with my people at night and would love it if my forever family was comfortable with that too!\n\nI'm listed as *foster to adopt* because I would love to get into my forever home as soon as possible, but I still need to by spayed :) I'm looking for a family that is willing to bring me to my spay appointment on Jan 28th in Minneapolis, and show me lots of love until I'm cleared for full adoption with you!\n\nAdoption Fee: $475*\n\n*I have a discounted adoption fee so my forever family can invest in training with me to help me with my separation anxiety, and continue with my medications until I'm feeling fully settled with you!\n\nTraining Requirement: Obedience Level 1\n\nMEET ME/ADOPT ME: If you'd like to arrange a meeting or begin the adoption process, please fill out an adoption application by visiting www.twincitiespetrescue.org/adopt/adopt-a-dog/ . A volunteer from Twin Cities Pet Rescue will contact you once your application is reviewed.\n\nFOSTER HOMES NEEDED!!! Twin Cities Pet Rescue is a volunteer-run, foster home-based organization. We can only rescue as many animals as available foster homes. Please consider saving the life of an animal in need and become a volunteer foster home today. To become a foster, fill out a dog or cat foster application on the Twin Cities Pet Rescue website: www.twincitiespetrescue.org . There is little to no cost to foster an animal. Twin Cities Pet Rescue provides its foster families with food, supplies, and veterinary care for its animals. All you need to do is supply the love!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Twin Cities Pet Rescue does not adopt to homes further than 60 miles from the Minneapolis/St. Paul Metro Area.",

She has huge paws and double dew claws. She was born around January 2018.\n\nYou should hear her bark! She has the biggest bark ever, and it's the loveliest bass tone - really, really low. She makes all the other dogs in the neighborhood sound like sopranos!\n\nMagnificent Petra likes people, and she seems to especially love men. She is good with other dogs.\n\nShe is very well-behaved and has good house manners. She is house broken and has no need for a crate. She is somewhat leash trained.\n\nPetra is not yet used to car rides, so she must be lifted into one. The easiest way is to lift her front paws in, then give her a booty boost to get the rest of her loaded.\n\nSPIN Pyrs are all in foster homes in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. Potential adopters are asked to make travel arrangements if they live elsewhere. All SPIN dogs are spayed or neutered, current on vaccinations and on heartworm prevention. Please go to our website www.SpinRescue.org and fill out an application for this great Great Pyrenees!",

She needs help working on potty training however she is doing really good from where she was the first couple of days! She loves to eat snow, her first snow experience was too funny as she didn't know what it was, she gets chilly after 6-8 minutes outside so you need to walk with her to make sure she goes potty. On sunny days she'll stay outside a bit longer and will play with our dog, she loves to run around the yard chasing her and she is fast!\n\nShe is great with our 7 year old and with other dogs, she might get a bit possessive with food and treats so it is important to feed them separately.\n\nGigi needs a family with lots of love to give, will be important to have patience with her and let her adjust and come out of her shell, she loves belly rubs and to hear she's a good girl!\n\nAdoption fee includes: Full veterinary exam, alter, prepaid microchip, dewormed, Rabies vaccine, DAPP vaccine, Bordetella vaccine, 4DX\n\n, flea/tick and heartworm preventative while in rescue.

Arctic was rescued from death row after being dumped at a high kill shelter in Georgia. This beautiful boy is so sweet despite everything he's been through. He loves when you pet his fluffy coat and scratch behind his ears. He gives the best hugs too! Arctic has been doing very well in his foster home and is slowly gaining some much needed weight. He has been good with other dogs he has met and really seems to gain confidence from being around other dogs, so he is looking for a home with a canine sibling or two. Arctic has even done well with his dog-savvy foster kiddos, but unfortunately, he'll need a home without cats. Arctic will need a forever family that is familiar with guardian breeds and a large yard for him to stretch his legs and patrol. We adore this fluffy marshmallow and have promised him the loving forever family he deserves... could it be yours??\n\nInterested in adopting?

She is warming up to us now and would benefit from a quiet, patient home (no little kiddos!) where someone can give her the time and space to trust and gain confidence. Her previous owners said she loved being with her people, playing fetch and playing with squeaky toys. If you you want to open your heart and home to this quiet sensitive soul, please make a phone consultation appointment to get more information on her. Check out my photos/videos!",

He gets excited sometimes (zoomies!) but is very respectful and quickly calms down if asked. He knows sit and shake. He takes treats ever so gently and is food motivated. Grayson seems to have a medium energy level; he is easy to walk on leash and enjoys exploring. He also loves to just hang out. He will gladly jump up beside you and attempt to sit in your lap - more scritches please! Grayson can be a bit shy with strangers and it will probably take a new family a couple of visits with Grayson for him to relax and feel comfortable. Patience and TLC will be key! If you're looking for an easy, fun and loving dog to put a smile on your face, Grayson is your guy!",

APPLICATIONS ARE PROCESSED IN THE ORDER THEY ARE RECEIVED.\n\nFoster comments:\n\nMeet Trevor a 7 month old hound mix puppy. He is currently @30 pounds and can potentially be @60 pound. Trevor is very friendly and is always excited to see other dogs on walks. He has not been around cats and has lived in a home with a child and they got along very well. He is looking for an active family who wants to go on lots of walks/hikes/runs with him. He is a puppy and deserves a family that has time for him.\n\nTrevor is a quiet dog, I have only heard him bark once, and he is housebroken! He goes out to the bathroom every 3-5 hours. Trevor sleeps great in his crate through the night with no accidents.\n\nTrevor has alot of puppy energy! After a 30-45 minute walk, he is ready to play for an hour. He needs to go to a family who will take him on several walks a day or go on runs and play with him after. A fenced yard is a must! A family with a child(ren) who will want to run around with him or a family with a young dog that likes to play could be a good fit for getting that energy out.\n\nTrevor loves to go on walks and explore. He is a puppy but he walks good on the leash and gets better every day. In addition to loving walks, he loves to play fetch, play with his toys and chase/watch squirrels.\n\nTrevor is very smart and has learns really fast. He has learned the command 'sit' and we are working on 'down'. He has also learned not to go up the stairs or inside the house before the person with him.\n\nIf your family has the time for a puppy, Trevor could be a good fit. He is very sweet, loving and a playful dog. He is looking for an active family who is not gone for 8 hours a day. After he gets his wiggles out, he is very calm and super cuddly and sweet. He will grow into a wonderful companion.\n\nEVERY DOG HAS A STORY: Trevor was found as a stray, all alone. He was taken to a rural shelter and BFPA is now looking for his forever home.\n\nINTERESTED IN ADOPTING TREVOR? If so, please fill out our dog adoption application by copying and pasting this link in a new browser window:\nhttps://toolkit.rescuegroups.org/of/f?c=WHMSYCNC",

            "description": "Welcome Bullet to CCPAL Rescue.  He is a 3-year-old Plot Hound mix that weighs about 75 lbs.  He is a little on the timid side and would be best with another dog for company.  He is a real home body and was raised spending most time in the back yard when his family works.  He spends it with another dog.  He would do best with kiddos 8 or older and another dog.  I think a family that is more of a home body family that wants a dog to match this lifestyle would be best.  He is in Texas and can be adopted locally or we can work with the wonderful transporters to deliver him to Washington, Portland, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Vermont or all along the East Coast.  His adoption fee it is 250 and transport is 185.  Rhode Island and Massachusetts are not states we adopt to because of the regulations imposed by these states. \n\nContact Marlene at 210-867-1769 or email to ccpalinquiries@gmail.com if you have questions.

Eden is looking for her furever home, a home that won't give up on her and that will give her a safe, loving sanctuary. She would prefer to be the only dog but could potentially be good with an older, well trained dog. Eden does not like when other dogs jump on her, get in her face, and crowd her personal space. She does walk on a leash, but will pull. We are working with her on this and she will need to continue her leash training in her new home. Eden is UTD on vaccines and will be spayed by our vet soon. Please consider giving this girl a second chance at a happy life, it hurts our hearts to see her so sad. We offer foster to adopt option.\n",

He came to the shelter as a lost boy on 01/13 and has not been found. Travis is a playful fellow and loves toys. He is still young and eager to please and will make a great student so that you can teach him all you want him to know. He already sits when told. A home with a back yard to romp in and then a nice soft bed at your feet would be perfect. Travis is current on his vaccines, now neutered, heartworm tested negative and will be micro-chipped upon adoption. He is waiting to meet you in run 826 and his ID# is 626854.\n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information. Shelter hours are: Tues. - Sun. 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. by appointment only until further notice, CLOSED Mondays & Holidays.",

Like his brother Diego, he was found at the southwest landfill and is now looking for a permanent home.  He is super friendly and happy to do anything with people.  He is about one year old, mixed breeds of German Shepherd and maybe Malinios, and weighs about 60 pounds.  He walks like a dream on leash, but will need to learn some house manners.  He will likely get along with a playful female dog, or his brother Diego.  They can, but don\u2019t have to be, adopted together.  It is likely cats may not be compatible, and children that are over 10 may be best due to Nelson\u2019s energetic nature.  Nelson would enjoy having a walk or hike daily and some playtime.\nPACA is a foster based rescue with no shelter to view our dogs. We have temporarily stopped all our public adoption events due to COVID-19, however we are still placing dog into loving homes by private appointment with approved applications.\n\nCompleted applications will be given to the foster to coordinate meetings as everyone feels comfortable. This application helps us get to know you and your family a little better so we can find the perfect match! Application are found here:\nhttp://www.nmpaca.org/images/pdf_files/PACA_Adoption_Application.pdf\nPlease email completed applications to pacadogs@aol.com\n\nAll our animals are spayed or neutered, vaccinated, microchipped and tested for tic born illness and heartworm prior to adoption. Our fee is $175.\n\n\n",

            "description": "Tipton will captivate with his golden eyes, but his adoring personality will win you over. Tipton comes from the Las Vegas NM shelter.  He was born a street dog until he was captured by animal control.  He was very scared at the shelter until a  PACA volunteer taught him to walk on a leash. Soon Tipton became adventurous and outgoing.  Tipton loves to climb on objects or rocks while hiking.  He has interesting brindle accents on his face and legs and his mix of breeds is not obvious, so we are calling him a mix of Heeler and German Shepherd. Tipton is perfect medium size of 47 pounds.  He loves to play with his female dog friends at his foster home, but can crash on a dog bed with the best of them.  Tipton is extremely observant and intelligent and learns commands and habits quickly.  Tipton is crate trained and house trained and walks on leash like a pro.  He would LOVE a playful female dog as a companion.  He enjoys playing chase with dogs and humans alike, but is still new to the fetch concept.  He will take a few days to warm up to his people, and may be shy around strangers, but once he trusts someone, it is forever.  No cats and children over 10 please.\nPACA is a foster based rescue with no shelter to view our dogs. We have temporarily stopped all our public adoption events due to COVID-19, however we are still placing dog into loving homes by private appointment with approved applications.\n\nCompleted applications will be given to the foster to coordinate meetings as everyone feels comfortable. This application helps us get to know you and your family a little better so we can find the perfect match! Application are found here:\nhttp://www.nmpaca.org/images/pdf_files/PACA_Adoption_Application.pdf\nPlease email completed applications to pacadogs@aol.com\n\nAll our animals are spayed or neutered, vaccinated, microchipped and tested for tic born illness and heartworm prior to adoption. Our fee is $175.\n\n",

            "description": "If you want a dog that will keep you smiling, then Diego is your dog.  He was found with his brother Nelson at the southwest landfill.  Diego has obviously lived with people, and loves them.  He is about one year young and will fill out to be around 75 pounds.  He is constantly goofy and smiling.  He has a unique Ridgeline of fur along his spine, so we think he is part Ridgeback and part German Shepherd.  He would be a great dog for a person that likes to hike or walk daily.  Diego is a clown and may get along great with a female dog.  He plays well with his brother Nelson.  Diego and Nelson would likely make a great addition to the home as a pair, but it isn\u2019t necessary they be adopted together.  Diego walks great on a leash, and would be happy hanging with s human family.  He will need a little manners training.  \nPACA is a foster based rescue with no shelter to view our dogs. We have temporarily stopped all our public adoption events due to COVID-19, however we are still placing dog into loving homes by private appointment with approved applications.\n\nCompleted applications will be given to the foster to coordinate meetings as everyone feels comfortable.

            "description": "??ADOPT PESO??\nHi all, I\u2019m Peso, an approximately 13 year old Chihuahua who was adopted from us back in 2017 & spent the past 3 years being the cherished companion of an elderly woman. I loved being a spoiled lapdog. Sadly, my mom passed away last month & family was unable to take me in. They reached out to HFD & I\u2019m so glad my former foster home was able to welcome me back with open arms. \n\nI am around 10 pounds, housebroken, neutered, vaccinated, microchipped & heartworm negative. I\u2019m fostered with other dogs & cats & I co-exist with them just fine, I just like my space. I would have no problem being an only pet as I love being spoiled by people. I\u2019m not interested in playing with other dogs. My favorite place to sleep is right next to my foster mom & I love burrowing under covers or couch blankets. Being a man of a certain age, I\u2019m set in my ways so if other animals get in my face I\u2019m snappy. But I\u2019m all talk to be honest, & also have almost no teeth left anyways. (HFD did a full dental with extractions back in 2017 because my teeth were so terrible.) But to be safe my foster mom is recommending a home without kids. \n\nAlthough I have pep in my step I\u2019m not overly yappy & I really love to just snooze next to you. Most of all, I just want to go somewhere where I can stay forever with someone that loves & understands Chihuahuas. I have a special senior adoption fee of $150. For further information please email my foster mom at amandarescues78@gmail.com or head over to www.heathersfosterdogs.com to download & submit an application online.\n\n(I am fostered in the south suburbs of Chicago & after your application is submitted we can set up a Covid-safe meet & greet.)",

            "description": "Mae is living in a foster home. Submit an application from our website and then make an appointment to meet her.\n\nMae is not eligible for foster and will be a straight adoption.\n\nAge: ~1.5 years \nWeight: ~41lbs\nHousebroken: Working on it! She needs to be on a strict schedule \nCrate trained: Working on it! She takes some time to settle (10-30 minutes) and will benefit from continued training for this\nDog sociability: Mae tested well with dogs at her prior shelter, but while in foster she has shown leash reactivity (barks/lunges at other dogs). She may be a bit selective of her dog pals and may do better with slower intros off-leash.\nCat sociability: Unknown\nKids: Friendly with kids\nIdeal home: Mae will do well in a quieter neighborhood where she can really work on her leash skills! She would love to get into training and have lots of awesome enrichment as she undergoes her heartworm treatment the next ~9 months. She is not a match for a high-rise/elevator building due to her leash reactivity. \n\nIf you're looking for a loyal, fun loving sweetheart, Mae is your gal. This girl has so much love to give and is always looking for ways to comfort and please. When she starts to feel at home, she'll start playing with her stuffy toys and is so cute while she chases them, squeaks them, or falls asleep on her toys. You can tell this girl loves fetch, she brings all of her toys back to her person and asks for them to be thrown again. She loves sniffing around and exploring the outdoors, looking up at you to make sure you have her back. She's so smart and realized so quickly that her crate is her safe den and has learned to sit by the door when she needs to go potty. Most importantly, she loves snuggles. She'll come up to you and bury her head by your shoulder to get affection and comfort. \n\nMae is heartworm positive and will be undergoing treatment at our Ellis Veterinary Clinic. OTAT will cover the cost of her treatment until she is heartworm negative. For information on the heartworm treatment process, visit: onetail.org/heartworm\n\nMae's adoption fee is 300. She is spayed, up to date on core vaccines, microchipped and heartworm positive.\n\n***We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications. We ask that you please be patient and someone will be in touch via email within 72 hours. Please do not email us unless you have not received a response in 72 hours. Please only fill out one adoption application. ***",

He's a quiet pup who will do best with an experienced adopter who has the patience and time to let him warm up to become your buddy. Because he is pretty cautious and timid, he will do best in a home without kids.\n\nHe does well with other dogs, and is tolerant of inspections, but proper intros would be required.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting WYATT please visit our website for our application www.underdogaz.com",

She came to us through a recent rescue effort from an overcrowded and underfunded shelter in Arkansas. In this particular area, when owners no longer want their pets, or a stray dog wonders on your property, you simply shoot it. Thats what happened to Dimples and many of the other dogs we took from this shelter. Thankfully our partner shelter was there to take Dimples in and her many friends that would have been left injured to die. Dimples has come a long way, she made it through this ordeal and many others that she has the scars to prove it, after spending almost two yers in the Arkansas shelter with no adopters coming through, we chose her and hope to be able to make her a Michigander! All she needs now is a place to call her own and be spoiled. We estimate her to be 6 years old, she is heartworm positive and has begun treatment through our shelter. She is a quite, calm and gentle girl that would love nothing more than a couch to lay on and someone to give her constant love! - We would have to cat test her if the adopters have a cat and need to do a dog to dog introduction with the adopters current dogs.",

Winston is dog, cat, and kid friendly, but he is a very high energy, driven young dog. He needs a home that will dedicate a LOT of time to training and exercise with him. He is mostly house trained and mostly crate trained, but he still needs work on a leash. He is very very sweet and LOVES to play and run around. He would be a great fit for a young active family that has prior experience with training a dog in basic manners.",

            "description": "Meeka is a 1-2 year old Shar-Pei mix. Meeka, along with her owner, and three other furry sisters and two other furry brothers, were evicted from their home last October. When asked to help, we made room for all dogs in the home. Meeka came to us pregnant, with puppies due soon. Within weeks of her arrival she gave birth to six beautiful puppies. Her puppies have found their homes and now she is ready for a forever home of her own. Meeka is a very loving, loyal girl. She is a medium sized dog but very sturdy in stature and totally house trained. Once you earn her trust, expect to be showered with kisses and have a rather large lap dog for a pet. Treats and patience are the tickets to getting on the Meeka train. She grew up in a house full of dogs and got along with all of them. We would,however, suggest a meet and greet with any other resident dogs. She has springs on her feet so a physical fence is required. \n\nAHeinz57 Pet Rescue and Transport is a 501c3 no-kill animal rescue located in De Soto, Iowa. Our pets are located at our facility and in foster homes around Central Iowa. We do adopt to out of town applicants, however we do require new family members be picked up in person. \n\nIf you are interested in meeting one of our adorable adoptables, the first step in our process is to complete an adoption application. To complete an application or read more about our adoption process, please visit our website:\n\nhttps://www.aheinz57.com/adopt-a-pet/adoption-process/\nOur adoption fees are:\n\n$300 - Puppies (up to 6 months)\n\n$195 - Dogs age 6 months - 7 years\n\n$100 - Senior Dogs (age 8 and up)\n\n$200 - Bonded Buddies\n\n$100 - Kittens (up to age 6 months)\n\n$150 - 2 Kittens\n\n$60 - Cats age 6 months and up\n\n$90 - 2 Cats\n\nFor the most up-to-date listing of adoptable animals, please visit our website: https://www.aheinz57.com/adopt-a-pet/\n\nThank you for considering adopting a rescue animal!",

We need to know how serious you are about the dog AND when you would be able to visit the shelter.  Thanks!**\n\nNAME: Schmidty\nAGE: About 2 years old\nWEIGHT: 72lbs\nBREED(S): Shepherd/Retriever mix\nREASON FOR ARRIVAL: Stray\n\nGENERAL INFO ABOUT PERSONALITY:\n\nSchmidty is an absolute angel with his happy smile and beautiful eyes that beg for your attention. He loves to play fetch in the yard and run around. He has a couple of play mates here that he likes as long as they don't try to go for his ball as he can be protective over his things.\n\nWe will be requiring a fenced yard for him as he likes to follow his nose and needs more work on his recall. Additionally, this dog is not meant for apartment life, he needs room and lots of exercise.\n\nHe walks the best on leash with a harness and some yummy jerky or pork treats. He doesn't walk nicely if it is just attached to his collar - although some training will help that. \n\nSchmidty would love to cuddle up next to his owner and receive belly rubs, he is a big snuggle buddy and will keep you warm. With a little more basic training, Schmidty will make anyone a great companion!\n\nActivity Level? Medium\nTraining Needs? Medium\nHouse Trained? Possibly\nLeash Trained? Partially, pulls a lot!\nComfortable with kids? Recommend no kids under 12\nComfortable with strangers? Yes\nHistory with other dogs? Dog selective\nHistory with cats? Not good!\n\nAdditional MEDICAL notes: None\nAdditional BEHAVIOR notes: None\n\nADOPTION FEE:  $150 for an adult dog.\n\nAdoption fee includes:  spay/neuter, initial vaccines, a microchip, rabies vaccine when appropriate, and one free veterinary visit with a local participating clinic.  \n\n***IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THIS DOG: please visit https://www.ophumanesociety.org/dog-adoption-application to fill out an application, or directly email OPHSpetfinder@gmail.com with any questions and/or to request a dog adoption application to be emailed to you instead of filling it out online.***\n\n***We cannot place a dog on hold for a meeting until we have an approved adoption application on file.  Adoptions will be determined based on the best qualified applicant for the dog.***",

            "description": "Purebred rottweiler female approximately 3 to 4 years old. Sweet personality, likes to cuddle. Healthy, good weight, seems to be good with dogs of all sizes from what we have observed so far. We rescued her from a shelter in las Angelas on 1/18/21. Looking for a home with owners that have time to work on her training, Older kids should be fine. Young kids may be fine too we just have not seen her with toddlers before. She is playful. She is Still a little nervous and unsure of her surroundings since Weinstein got her a couple of days ago. \n \n\nyou must live in Arizona to adopt from us. \n \n\nOur Adoption Process... If you are interested in adopting one of our fun loving not so rotten rotties, you will be asked to fill out a questionnaire that will allows us to get to know you better and to make sure the dog you are looking at is a good fit for your family and lifestyle. You can access our questionnaire by going to our website, www.rottenrottie.com click on the forms tab, and fill out the questionnaire and submit it online. After we review your answers, if we feel that the dog that you are interested in, is not a good fit for you and your family, we may recommend a different rottweiler companion. After we determine which Rottweiler(s) is the best for you, we will set up a time so that you can meet him or her at their house, where they will feel most comfortable and act as they normally do. An adoption contract will be signed to finalize the adoption and we do ask for a rehoming fee of $400 for most adults, $250 for most of our seniors 6 years and above for any rottweiler mix of any age (except puppies) . Our fees for puppies fluctuate depending on how much we had to invest into them or their litter, and weather they are purebred or a mix. These funds are necessary so that our organization may continue to rehome rottweilers. ALL of our dogs are sterilized, fully vaccinated and microchipped, heartworm tested negative and come with a collar and a leash. We have also addressed any injury or illness that they had when they came to us, or received in foster care. These problems will be disclosed to the adopter prior to adoption.",

            "description": "This beautiful girl is only a year old and has already had a littler of puppies. The person who had her before kept her in an outdoor kennel that was barely 4 x 6 ft so Tanzie had not experienced much in her young life. Fast forward a few weeks later after she has finished raising her puppies and learned how to enjoy all the comforts and love of being a beloved member of a family. She is a happy, easy going girl whose tail wags at the sight of her people and she plays happily with toys and with the other doggies. From the day she arrived she was great with the doggies and even when she had her puppies she was friendly. Best guess on her breed is a shepherd mix of some kinds. She has the most perfect mask on her face and a pretty tan and white coat of medium length - so pretty! This smart girl is completely house trained and taught herself how to use the dog door so she can come and go as she desires. Walking on leash is great fun for this girl and her family wonders if she might have some hound in her as she is constantly sniffing and exploring her environment. Tanzie is a medium girl who weighs about 40 lbs but could stand to gain another 5 lbs. She tested positive for ehrlichia from a tick bite. Treatment is 30 days of antibiotics which will be completed mid February. Tanzie does like to bark at deer and wildlife.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting please complete an application at https://www.circle2rescue.com/dog-adoption-application/ The adoption fee of $350 includes the spay/neuter, vaccinations, deworming and microchip. \n\nPlease note, Circle 2 Rescue cannot guarantee the breed, composition or ages of our dogs as we usually have no history prior to them entering the rescue. We make every effort to ensure the dogs are healthy.",

I'm so excited to see you and play, that I tend to get in others personal space. My education has been a little lacking, but if you're ready to teach and have yummy treats, I'm ready to learn. Half of my face has facial paralysis, so it might look like I'm snarling, but I'm really a happy, go-lucky guy! With time and patience, I can show you just how smart I could be! I need to meet all kids and any other dogs in the home. Chico will be shown by appointment only. If you are interested in learning more about this animal, please fill out an application by clicking here . Be sure to include Chico A1364344 when filling out the survey. After reviewing your application, we will only be reaching out to you if the animal is a good fit for your home.",

My great personality gets even better because I also get along with other dogs. I haven\u2019t been cat tested yet, but I certainly can be. \nIf you are interested in adopting me, I would love to share my personality with you and your family. Please call the shelter to learn more about how to adopt!!!\n\n(More pictures coming soon!)\n",

            "description": "Hi, my name is Toby. I'm about 10-11 months old, and my foster mom thinks I'm mostly an English Pointer with maybe some Border Collie or Lab mixed in. I'm neutered, heartworm negative, and up to date on vaccinations. I currently live with other dogs and cats and get along well with them. I'm an active boy, curious about everything, and I've enjoyed the few car rides I've been on. I love walks outside, and I'm currently working on leash training and potty training as well as learning how to sit and stay. I am crate trained and don't have accidents in my crate ever. Chew toys are the best and I have never chewed on anything in the house but my toys. \n\nBecause of my breed, age, and personality, I like to have a lot of stimulation and attention. With some training, I'd probably be a good camping or jogging buddy- I'd just really like to have a mom or dad that has an active lifestyle that I can be a part of. I'm nervous when I meet new people so I bark at them and that makes me look a little intimidating, but I warm up fairly quickly and I'm young enough that I can learn to overcome this behavior with some patience and socialization training.\n\nIf you are interested in giving Toby a forever home, please visit the link below to fill out an application! http://fureverafterrescue.org/adoption-application.html It is best to submit an application through a computer. We have experienced some problems when applications have been submitted using a mobile device. *When you submit the application, you are not obligated to adopt however it does reserve for you the opportunity to adopt that particular animal. We review them on a first come first served basis. If your application is approved, we will contact you and allow you the opportunity to adopt. If you choose not to adopt, we will contact the next approved applicant. If you have any questions or difficulties, please contact us and we will be glad to help!",

            "description": "Belle is currently fostered in Mentor Ohio, and her adoption fee/donation is $300\n\nBelle is a beautiful 5-6 yr old female cocker spaniel.\nShe was surrendered to us due to her alpha personality with other dogs, and her separation anxiety.\n\nBelle will need a special home, one where she is the only dog, and where someone is home during the day.\nShe will fight with select other dogs, especially females. She has severe separation anxiety so she doesn't do well when left alone.\n\nHere is a note from her foster.....\n\nBelle (AKA Bella) is a rambunctious personality and needs to maintain her interaction with her human(s) all the time. She is on high alert for doorbells, trucks & cars going by and geese and ducks in the yard.\nShe is very anxious while walking and goes back and forth in front of the person walking her. She does well in the back yard away from road noises. She travels in the car well. She responds well to calming commands and enjoys a treat for good behavior. Belle sleeps in a large crate with her blanket and a bed she sleeps well through the night. Belle needs to sleep in the same room with her human. She does not like to be alone during the day or night. She can work her cage open when anxious and will roam\nanxiously and unhappily through the house. She will need a warm loving person familiar with the personality of cockers.\n\nShe is spayed and up to date on vaccines and micro chipped\n\nIf you would like to adopt Belle or would like more information on her, please fill out an adoption application\nWe do not have a shelter, all rescues are in foster homes - Dogs are not shown without first being approved to adopt.\nComplete an Adoption Application Here\nwww.cherishedcockers.org/adoptionapp.htm\nIf you have any questions, please E-mail Cherished Cockers Rescue\nAdoption Donation (vet bill-expenses), Home Visit, Adoption Contract, References Required.\nWe do not ship dogs.Pet needs to be picked up at foster home.In some cases we may be able to assist with transport. \nWe would love to have more foster volunteers so we can rescue and rehome more cocker spaniels. If you are interested in fostering or learning more about it, please complete a Foster Application Here and one of our wonderful volunteers will be in touch!\nwww.cherishedcockers.org/foster.htm\nFor more information Cherished Cockers Rescue\nwww.cherishedcockers.org",

Born around December 2016, he weighs 80 pounds and could stand to gain another 10 or so.\n\nEzra came to SPIN in early December 2020 when a good Samaritan found him on the side of the road. Someone had shot him and left him to die. After lots of around the clock veterinary care and lots of love and support from his foster family, Ezra made a full recovery. Just a few days later, he managed to rip out his stitches from his neuter surgery, so back to the ER and back in a cone he went.\n\nNow after five weeks of cones, and rest, and a really good grooming, Ezra is ready for his big debut!\n\nSweet Ezra and has never met dog or human he doesn't like! However, he isn't a fan of chickens or cats.\n\nHe loves, loves, loves toys! Ezra is the Pyrfect kind of Pyr, because he would do excellent in either a home with other doggos to play with or in a home as an only pup.\n\nHe is house trained, crate trained, does fantastic in a car. He is okay on leash and could use more practice. He is very vocal and loves letting his voice be heard.\n\nDespite being dealt a pretty crummy hand to life in the beginning, Ezra is nothing but a bundle of joy and happiness, and he finds adorable ways to show he is grateful for his new lease on life.\n\nHave we mentioned the Pyr paw? We're pretty sure this kid wrote the book on it.\n\nEzra is so dreamy with his medium length super soft fur and paw-some patches of unique coloring. He is blind in one eye, but it doesn't seem to bother him at all.\n\nIf you're looking for the most humble, adorable, and youthful pup, Ezra might be your guy!\n\nSPIN Pyrs are all in foster homes in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. Potential adopters are asked to make travel arrangements if they live elsewhere. All SPIN dogs are spayed or neutered, current on vaccinations and on heartworm prevention. Please go to our website www.SpinRescue.org and fill out an application for this great Great Pyrenees!",

Keller sleeps through the night in his crate and is working hard on his house training. He loves playing with other dogs, so he must have another dog in his forever home. \nKeller has some vision loss and a left hip abnormality that he may grow out of, or may need surgery in the future.  But this would be a surprise to Keller. He doesn\u2019t seem to know or care about any of this, and it doesn't bother him or his playing with other dogs. Keller will do best in a residential area vs. the city, as he is not fond of loud noises and trucks. All the qualities that people so often look for in a puppy can be found in Keller. He is a sweet, easy pup, with lots of love to give.\nIf you are interested in this dog, please submit an application directly to our website at www.ny-petrescue.org.  Only applications submitted directly to Petrescue will be considered.",

However, once my people introduce me to new people I quickly fall in love with them. I know my name, how to sit, how to give high fives, and how to shake my paw. I absolutely love being close to my people and just laying next to them all day. I am non reactive towards cats and dogs, but since I love to have all of the attention it is probably best if I'm the only pet in the house. I am working on being crate trained. I am a quick learner and once you let me know how to say when I need to go outside, I always will! I love going for long walks or just curling up on the couch. I'm also a great conversationalist and would love to talk with you!",

            "description": "King Kong is a 1 year old dog who is hoping to find his forever home.  This energetic boy wants to play and run with people.  Unfortunately when he came to Hopeful Tails, he was restricted from this since he was heartworm positive.  He has completed his treatment and finally can enjoy life.  When he first meets someone, he will roll on his back so you can scratch his stomach.  Pick up a toy and he's ready for a game of fetch.  Want to walk? King Kong will excitedly join you.  His personality will have you smiling and laughing all day.  King Kong wants all the love and attention though, he needs to be the only dog in a home. Additionally, we recommend a home with older (12 yrs. +)  or no kids. Currently, King Kong weighs 45 lbs.\n\nOur loving boy\u2019s adoption fee is $300 which includes his neuter, microchip implant, fecal exam, and shots up to date. \n\nPlease consider opening your heart and loving home to this amazing pup. King Kong is so worth it.\n\nNote:\n\nAll dogs require a $100 training deposit. Once confirmation of the completion of a training class has been sent to the rescue, you will receive your deposit back in full.\n\nAs we are a rescue all of our adult dogs/puppies for adoption must be spayed or neutered. Although we make every attempt to have this done before finding their adoptive families, this is not always possible. Please speak with your adoption coordinator to see of this service has already been performed or they will explain to you if your new dog/puppy will need this service while in your care at no cost to you.\n\nWhen emailing please include your phone number to help speed up the adoption process.   Also, for the safety of our dogs we only adopt within a 2 hour radius of Joliet, Illinois to allow our volunteers to do home checks if necessary.",

Cuddling and being near his people is his favorite, so be ready for smooches. Princeton is housebroken and non destructive and he enjoys the company of both cats and dogs making him perfectly well-rounded. He'd love to find his furever home this winter so you can keep each other warm and cozy! \n\nPrinceton is about 2 years old and weighs about 62 pounds.\n\nIf you're interested in meeting Princeton, please visit our website to learn about our adoption process and to fill out an application, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs and cats will be micro-chipped, spayed or neutered, and up-to-date on vaccinations at the time of adoption. For more photos of Princeton, follow us on Facebook Gateway Pet Guardians and Instagram @gatewaypets ... #gpgPrinceton. \n\nTo view other adoptable pets from our shelter, please visit, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nGateway Pet Guardians is proud to offer a variety of mixed breed dogs available for adoption. However, please keep in mind that we rarely know the genetic background of the animals we rescue and, as such, we cannot guarantee the exact breed combinations found within this dog. However, we do not know his/her actual genetic makeup. Just know that this dog is probably a variety of several different breeds that have combined to create one very amazing and unique animal.",

            "description": "Looks like: Dachshund / Terrier Mix\nFemale, 5 years old, 11 pounds\nSunny Delight had a rough start, but she has blossomed in her foster home and is a happy dog when she is home with the people she trusts. In her foster home she has joyous, bouncy energy and her tail wags constantly. It does take her some time before she trusts people, so she would do best in a quiet home with a patient adopter who will let her progress and trust at her own pace. This is very important for her. If you push her too quickly, she'll lose the trust in people that her foster family has worked so hard to earn. \n\nShe does trust females more readily than males, which is often the case with shy dogs. \n\nShe still gets worried if either of her foster parents approach her or try to initiate a pet or touch, but she will allow affection when she's curled up in a bed or on the couch or if she goes to them for affection which is starting to happen little by little. Interactions need to be initiated by her. She does enjoy being by her person and hanging out wherever they are. \n\nShe gets along fine with other dogs, and we think she'd be fine in a home with cats. She'd be a great buddy for another dog. She can be playful if they want to play, and is also happy to snuggle up to another dog and take a nap. \n\nShe is very quiet, polite, sleeps through the night and is house trained. Riding in a car stresses her out at this point. Having a secure yard is important for Sunny. Her potty routine is made much easier and less stressful on everyone involved if they there is a secure yard she can access. \n\nSunny Delight was found by animal control with a stillborn puppy hanging out of her and she had more stillborn puppies inside. She was taken to Hitchcock Road Animal Services. They were able to get her to a veterinarian for a c-section and to be treated for sepsis. It was touch and go, but she survived. She went through a deep depression after losing her puppies. \n\nWe believe she lived on the streets fending for herself for quite a while or was very under socialized in a previous home because of her semi-feral nature. With all she has been through, she has never shown any sign of aggression. She really wants to trust people and to love and be loved. It will just take her some time and patience.",

            "description": "Lakey, a black petite beauty (weighs 48lbs), is super loyal and sweet.  This two year old angel loves belly rubs and is very energetic. She loves to run around outside. She has very good house manners, and is not much of a barker. Lakey does suffer from separation anxiety, and she chews/scratches things when she gets stressed. She does okay with other dogs in the neighborhood on walks but a meet and greet would be required. Lakey does not seem to get along with smaller animals, so we would recommend she does not go to a home with cats or similar animals.  She can be a bit weary around visitors to a home and she takes a little bit longer to warm up to men. Lackey is currently 48lbs.\n\nLackey\u2019s adoption fee is $300 which includes her spay, microchip implant, fecal exam, and shots up to date. \n\nPlease consider opening your heart and loving home to this precious girl. We promise you she is worth it. \n\nNote: \n\nAll dogs require a $100 training deposit. Once confirmation of the completion of a training class has been sent to the rescue, you will receive your deposit back in full.\n\nAs we are a rescue all of our adult dogs/puppies for adoption must be spayed or neutered. Although we make every attempt to have this done before finding their adoptive families, this is not always possible. Please speak with your adoption coordinator to see of this service has already been performed or they will explain to you if your new dog/puppy will need this service while in your care at no cost to you.\n\nWhen emailing please include your phone number to help speed up the adoption process.   Also, for the safety of our dogs we only adopt within a 2 hour radius of Joliet, Illinois to allow our volunteers to do home checks if necessary.",

She is a one year old girl who looks like she has some Australian Cattle Dog (Heeler) and some hound in her. She is fun loving and LOVES everyone! Other dogs, cats, kids, etc. Maisel is happy to cuddle up with anyone and everyone.\n\nShe is full grown at 46 pounds and has the cutest little bobtail to wag when she is happy. Maisel is working on housetraining and almost has it down. She walks pretty well in a leash, but is learning to not pull.

She also loves to play with toys and will almost fetch.....she goes after the toy but hasn't brought it back just yet. We are sure she could get the gist of it with some training and encouragement. Krissy also recently conquered stairs for the first time at her foster family's house and is settling in well. The adorable video of her foster family cheering her on as she conquers the stairs is available on our website.\n\nKrissy is a high energy dog and can get easily excited so we recommend older children in the home. This is only because she may accidentally knock over a little one with her excitement. Krissy is completely house trained and crate trained and walks fairly well on a leash - sometimes things outdoors can be distracting! Krissy gets along well with other dogs and loves to engage and play, but some dogs may not love her higher energy level. She has a high prey drive, so we do not recommend a home with cats or other small animals. Krissy just needs the right family to give her the love and training she needs and she will return your love tenfold. If you think Krissy may be a good fit for you and your home, please read the paragraph below in its entirety.\n\nAs a purely foster based rescue, we have no central location where you can visit our dogs. Therefore, we only honor meet requests from pre-approved adopters, with an application on file. Please fill in our online adoption application at www.myaarf.org as fully as you can and allow at least 24-48 hours for a response from our busy volunteers. Our adoption fee is $450 which includes all transport, vetting, and micro-chipping. *Proof of completion of obedience training within 90 days of adoption is a requirement for adoption through AARF.*\n\n2/1/21 4:14 PM",

His owner became ill and could no longer care for him. He adjusted really well into his new foster home. Max is playful, affectionate, and Yes he is a terrier, into a little mischief.....He LOVES to be with people, and will even follow you into the bathroom! He gets along with other dogs, no issues.\n\nWe were hoping to get Max a much needed dental, but pre-dental Labs were concerning. So instead of having a dental Max has gone through a number of test/ procedures, trying to figure out what is going on internally.\n\nSo far, testing is showing acute kidney disease. Max is now on special food with hopes of slowing down this chronic disease. There are other concerning Labs, we are now starting an antibiotic to fight a possible infection.\n\nWe realize with all of Max\u2019s medical issues it will take a special home to adopt him and give him the medical care he needs. We are hopeful there is someone who loves the Tibetan breed or who has had a similar experience with their personal dog that would be willing to give Max a chance.\n\nPlease let us know if you have any specific questions about Maxwell or if you would be willing to donate funds on his behalf.\nYou can send money via paypal to apbpets@schnauzerama.org or mail a donation to: Animal Placement Bureau, P. O. Box 80146, Lansing, MI 48908-0146\n\nIf you have any questions, please email tzupoomom@gmail.com .\nYou can find our application at http://apbdogs.org/apply-for-adoption/\n\nAnimal Placement Bureau's standard adoption fee is $250 but is negotiable for Senior dogs. All dogs are spayed or neutered, updated on required vaccinations, tested for heart worm and many receive dental cleanings. \n\nOur adoption process includes an application, personal and vet reference checks, and a home visit. We do not ship dogs under any circumstances.  \nWe do not have a facility; all of our dogs are fostered in private homes.  Appointments to visit our dogs are only available after an application has been filled out, and processing has begun.\nPlease be kind to our volunteers. E-mail inquiries will be answered much faster than phone inquiries; our phone number is a voice mailbox only. \nIf you'd like to apply to adopt one of our dogs, please fill out the online application at http://apbdogs.org/apply-for-adoption/.",

We have applications at sparrowdogs.com, and please tell us a little about yourself, that helps. We want to make the very best fit not just for Ella but her future family as well :) !!****************\n\n   EllaBella, that has become this big goofballs nickname. We really just call her \"Ella\", but when she is really silly, or perhaps naughty, she gets the EllaBella. Ella is just 2 years old and has had a bumpy past. We know that she was adopted from a shelter and did not do well with the toddler in the house, hence, no small children.  It is stressful for a dog to be around children/infants, I cannot blame Ella, just was not the right home, many dogs just are not comfortable around the little ones( many people too, lol!!)  She is also potty trained, non-destructive and knows basic commands. \n\nElla is a very outdoorsy girl. This recent snowfall made her day!!  We have been out running, playing, throwing snowballs and going for a big walk. EllaBella had to climb up every snow bank the plow made.  She is such a happy girl and she does know basic commands. BUT...she does need a dog savvy family/person.  She needs a (as Cesar Milan would say) a calm, assertive person in her life. IF you are not in charge, well guess who will take over??  So many super intelligent breeds are like that, they will be your best friend and right hand man, but if you can't lead the pack, they will take over. \n\nElla will do well with some basic training classes, perhaps some agility, talk about channeling that energy and athleticism. She wants to please, snuggle, love and be a huge part of your life. I know there is that special someone out there for this most perfect girl. We think she is pretty darn awesome!\n\n She can be a little shy meeting new people, that is expected after all the recent transitions, but she is truly one in a million!!  Her adoption fee is $300, she is fully vetted, the adoption fee is tax deductible, and she will go home with plenty of supplies to help her settle in. Please email Kristine at joysparrows@gmail.com.  (Please NO phone calls)  EllaBella is 2 years old and 60 pounds.",

I bet you'd never guess, but I have this funny dream of being a social media influencer one day. Oh, I have an idea! We could work together and make me the star of my very own Instagram account!

            "description": "My name is Tater. People describe me as affectionate - I'm cuddly, lovable, and I like to give kisses and snuggle. I may be a bit nervous at first, but once I warm up, you'd better watch out because I'll be ready to party! I need a home where all kids are at least school age. I need to meet all family before going home with them. I'm a dog that needs to be the star of the show. This means that I need a home where I'm the only dog so your attention will solely be on me for your canine companionship. I'm not a fan of felines (and they may not be a fan of me), so I'll need a home without cats. I am not suitable for apartment living. Tater will be shown by appointment only. If you are interested in learning more about this animal, please fill out an application by clicking here . Be sure to include Tater A1365702 when filling out the survey. After reviewing your application, we will only be reaching out to you if the animal is a good fit for your home.",

            "description": "Wayland is the spunky life of the party! This girl is curious and always likes to see what's going on. Wayland acts like a puppy. She loves playing with her squeaky toys, rope toys, or wrestling with her canine companions. She is most comfortable when she has one or two other dogs around. She can sometimes take a few minutes to warm up to a new person, but her curiosity gets the best of her and she can't help but come say hello! She is a very sweet, good dog that would make an awesome addition to someone's family.\n\nWayland has some typical cattle dog traits like nipping, but she doesn't mean any ill-will. She thinks she is playing and is gentle about it! Because of this, young children may not be suitable for her unless they are used to this behavior. She is learning how to walk on a leash and learning basic commands. She is a smart girl and will do anything for a treat!\n\nWayland is only available for foster-to-adopt at this time. She is heartworm positive and will need to get started on her treatment soon. All medical expenses are taken care of by the rescue when the dog is in foster-to-adopt care. Wayland will have no lasting health issues as a result of her heartworm status. She will be a normal, healthy young dog!",

            "description": "Val\n2yr old Mastiff/Boxer mix\n\nHi there, I\u2019m Val! I\u2019m so excited to meet you! I get excited a lot and I can hardly contain myself! It must be the boxer in me, we boxer mixes have lots and lots of energy! \nI came to rescue a month ago and now I\u2019m ready to find my forever home! Boy oh boy am I excited! When I first came to rescue, I was so happy to be back in a home I couldn\u2019t stop running around and bouncing all over the place. I love couches and fireplaces and cozy dog beds to sleep on and humans to cuddle. More than comfy things, I love LOVE food. If you got a treat I\u2019ll listen! That\u2019s how my family is training me because no one taught me how to have manners. When I first got to my foster home, I was very excited and jumped, mouthed, and tugged on her clothes\u2026 a lot. I did not know how to act politely when I wanted something and sometimes, I could be a little rude about it. It took some work to teach me that I\u2019m not a puppy anymore (I\u2019m 2!) and I\u2019m too big for that behavior. I have gotten much better, but I still do get myself all excited sometimes and need reminders to use my inside manners. My foster mom says I can be fairly stubborn and I don\u2019t always like to listen. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m stubborn, I\u2019m just a diva and I know what I want! Because of these traits and the manners I am working on,  I should not be in a home with kids. My new family should understand energetic breeds and have experience training and managing stronger, more\u2026 *ahem*\u2026. diva like dogs. \nI have learned some very good habits though! I am very good in my crate, sometimes I even put myself to bed at night. I know I can\u2019t go to the bathroom in the house and I\u2019ll ask to go outside. I am very food motivated and like to learn new things and my foster mom keeps working with me. The things I\u2019m best at though are being goofy to make you laugh and loving you to pieces! I enjoy snuggles and attention and just want to be close to my family and know where they are. Once I am attached to my people, I will be so loyal to them and love them forever and ever. I\u2019m a very sweet girl and just want lots of love and affection and I\u2019m not afraid to ask for it! Sometimes I can be a bit vocal when I want something and I will make all sorts of funny noises until you listen to what I have to say. I am learning I have an inside voice but sometimes I don\u2019t want to use it so maybe a detached house is best for me. I also love to run around and get out my zoomies and bounces so a fenced yard to do that would be important. Did I tell you I LOVE ball? I listen to my mom for a ball almost as well as I do for food! I love playing fetch and I don\u2019t seem to ever get tired of it. I really like playing with other dogs too! I love to meet them on walks and I have fun play dates with other dogs. I would be okay in a home with another dog if it was the right dog. Sometimes I don\u2019t like to share and I am learning that\u2019s not very nice and I have to be more polite. I do apologise to my friends with kisses and more play once when I\u2019m told I have to share. I do have a cat foster brother and I really really just want to be his friend and play with him! He doesn\u2019t like me much though. I am better at giving him his space but sometimes I like to try and get him to play still. \nThere is one other important thing you should know about me. I have an enlarged heart and a grade four heart murmur. This puts me at a greater risk for heart failure later in my life. Don\u2019t be sad though! You would not know this by looking at me! I don\u2019t let it get in my way. Right now, I\u2019m living my best life playing and getting lots of walks and exercise. My heart is good and I do not show any signs of heart failure. It just means that down the road I might need some medication and I should go for annual check-ups to make sure everything is in working order. \nMy foster mom says I\u2019m a very sweet and fun girl with a big personality that will make you laugh. She says I\u2019m a good girl and will find the perfect family to help me be my best self. I realise I have a bit of a big list of requirements for my new home, but for those that have a soft spot for goofy, loyal, loving and energetic dogs with a personality you will not be disappointed. I will be the first to give you kisses in the morning, the first to make you laugh, the first to great you when you get home and the last to cuddle you at night. I am really looking forward to meeting you! \nVap has been vaccinated,  microchipped, dewormed, heartworm tested, spayed, treated with Advantage, and has had ultra sound done on her heart. It is reccomended that her future home follow up in 1yrs time for another ultra sound to ensure nothing has changed. \nVal came to us as an unclaimed stray from LACC. \n\nThe adoption fee is $600 and includes spay/neuter (dogs over 6 months), vaccines, heartworm test (dogs over 6 months), deworming, Flea and tick prevention and microchip. Please visit www.paws-united.com to fill out an application.\n**For puppies under 6 months a $200 spay/neuter rebate will be given with proof of spay/neuter certificate signed by a vet, if they have not been done prior to adoption.**\n**Please note we DO NOT adopt our dogs as outdoor/farm dogs. These dogs are coming to us as stray, roaming or dogs that have lived a life tied to a chain. Our goal is to bring them in the house off the chain and give them a pampered indoor dogs lifestyle. Unless otherwise stated we will not even consider a home that has intentions of leaving our dogs outdoors or tied to a chain**",

            "description": "If you are interested in adopting this dog, please download and complete an Adoption Questionnaire from our website and email US at DenaE@k-9lifesavers.org\nYou can learn about the adoption process and find a Word, PDF and ONLINE version of the questionnaire by visiting: http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/howtoadopt/.\nDog's Name: Lunagirl\nEstimated Breed : Red Heeler Cattle Dog Mix\nApproximate Age: 8 months\nApproximate Weight: approx. 35 lbs\nCurrently Living at: Boarding\nAdoption Fee: $300\nDOG'S DESCRIPTION\nThis sweetie is looking for an active home with lots of space to run. She is friendly, but still very young and has a lot to learn. Luna is a super sweet, energetic dog who will make a family or person very happy. She does great with other dogs and loves people. She does jump up for attention, so small kids might unintentionally get knocked over, but with training she could definitely do-exist with small kids. She loves to crawl into your lap for attention as well, so is capable of taking it easy as well. If you have to the time to train and energy to keep up with her high energy lifestyle, please apply!\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\nSponsor Me! Make a tax-deductible donation today by visiting us at http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/donate/ . Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support!\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\nPlease \"like\" our Facebook Page for the most current events and new dogs.\nThank you for considering a rescue dog!",

If you have any questions regarding one of our Mastiffs, please read their bio and if you still have questions- drop us an email at info@greatplainsmastiffrescue.org . If you have questions about our adoption procedures, please go to our Pages of Interest on the left hand column under 'Adoption Info.' We answer email inquiries almost immediately-usually always within a few hours and phone calls are returned with 24-36 hours.\n\nGPMR does not have a shelter. All of our dogs are kept in loving foster homes. We must have a completed adoption\napplication on file before meeting any of our mastiffs.\n\nGPMR adopts to the states of Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, Arkansas, Missouri, Louisiana and parts of Colorado.\n!!!Any mastiffs being adopted out of the state of Oklahoma require a health certificate to be paid for by the adopter!!!\n\nMeet Otis! This sweet boy came to GPMR from a family that loves him very much but could no longer keep him. They described him as the perfect family dog. The day we met him, we knew how hard it was for them to let go because they were right, he is perfect! He is good with kids and other dogs, we were told he is scared of cats!Although he is the size and stocky build of a Bullmastiff, he has a handsome English Mastiff face and temperament. He has a vibrant apricot coat with pitch black markings. In addition to being stunningly beautiful, Otis is healthy! He was treated for ear infections (his owner said he gets these on/off) and will need routine ear rinses to maintain healthy ears. But unlike a lot of dogs, Otis will sit still and let you take care of him. At 7 years old, he is very docile and calm. He enjoys napping near people and will play in short bursts followed by more napping. Otis is polite and obedient. He rarely barks and is house trained. He has free roam of the house when left, he's never been destructive.If you've been looking for a rescue dog that has a known background and doesn't come with baggage, meet Otis. He is already a great pet, he just needs a new home. He would be a great dog for a first time Mastiff owner!Otis is being fostered in Yukon, OK.Save a Mastiff...Adopt, Foster, Volunteer!",

            "description": "Listo (pronounced LEE-stow) is a super sweet, loving 7 year old, 32 lb. Australian cattle dog. He is highly active and intelligent, extremely loyal, and is considered a \u201cvelcro\u201d dog. He is always curious to know what his owners are up to and needs to be right where the action is. However, he does have a lot of anxiety in certain situations, and is protective of his home when strangers first enter his house or property. When he feels comfortable and safe, Listo is THE best dog. His joy is in pleasing his people. This boy needs an adults only home (no children), in a quiet setting. Listo is not good with cats, but he may be ok living with an easy going, calm, respectful dog, who will not get in his face. \n\nListo is a happy boy, who has a lot of personality, somewhere between being almost human and a silly cartoon character. He is extremely food motivated, and an eager helper in the kitchen. He is generally chill around a quiet house, and loves to cuddle. In the morning, he shows his love by waiting for his people to stir, and will crawl up to snuggle into you. A long morning walk is next in his daily routine. Listo rides well in a car, and is completely housebroken.\n\nAs an energetic guy with an active brain he needs to be exercised every day, and usually walks five miles each day. He enjoys being on the move and loves working/training and learning new tricks. Listo looks forward to his training sessions each evening. He needs to routinely work for treats in order to help keep his mind stimulated.\u00a0As a result, Listo is a highly trained dog who knows several commands.\n\nListo loves long walks and is always up for hiking, walking on the beach, and generally being outdoors. He walks well on leash and when in public, he is excited to meet new people and will run up to greet them. On walks, he minds his own business and does not react to other dogs. If off-leash in a park or beach, he enjoys a quick greeting other dogs before running to keep up with his people. If allowed to play with other dogs, Listo will use herding moves, circling and going for their feet, which may annoy some dogs. The only dogs he will react badly to are German Shepherds. Listo once had a bad encounter with a German Shepherd, and now becomes alarmed and very upset when he sees one, often growling, barking and pulling.\n\nListo\u2019s Story (by his current people):\nListo has been through a lot. We rescued him when he was around 1.5 years old, after he was found as a stray in Oklahoma. It was apparent from the beginning that Listo had anxiety and had difficultly calming down and focusing when triggers (loud noises, garbage trucks, skateboards, etc.) were present.\u00a0This manifested through barking, pacing constantly, and occasional urinary incontinence. Listo was able to overcome all of this, after a great deal of time, training, patience, and love. He is a graduate of various manners and agility classes.\n\nPart of his journey included consults with a behavior specialist at the San Francisco SPCA, after behavior modification training was only able to take him so far.\u00a0Working closely with the specialist, it ultimately decided that Listo would be best suited for a medication (along with continued training). He has been on daily doses of Clomicalm for just over 4 years and is now able to refocus even when most triggers are present. Also, he no longer has urinary incontinence issues. Listo consistently shows us that he is highly trainable as we are always working with him on new tricks and behavior changes. \n\nIn 2019, an eye specialist observed that Listo's vision was diminishing due to a hereditary condition and that eventually he would be blind. It is estimated that he can see about 50% currently, but he is very smart and adaptable to his surroundings. He has no problem navigating areas that are well lit and areas that he is familiar with. His diminishing vision may cause him to react to unknown people coming into his home, and be hesitant in new places/situations. \n\nLikely due to his poor vision and being unfamiliar with children, in January he unexpectedly and unprompted lunged and bit at the feet of a 6 year old in rubber boots who was visiting in our yard. Fortunately the child was okay. He has also nipped at the heels of several adult guests in our home in the past couple of years, who Listo did not know well. This nipping behavior was not present during the first couple years with Listo, but it developed over time.  With people his negative reaction seems to be triggered if they are wearing boots or baggy pants. He also barks and paces when guests arrive at the house and has difficulty calming down. We were working with a trainer in our home in early 2020 to address these issues, but due to the pandemic, were unable to continue training at home. As we have not had guests in the last year due to COVID, we have not been able to address this more recent behavior. Additionally, the recent birth of our son has caused an increase in anxiety for Listo at home as well as overprotective behavior. \n\nWe are hoping that Listo can find a quiet home with adventurous owners who will enjoy exercising and working with him daily, where the owners understand the needs of not only a cattle dog but a pup with special needs, and are adaptable to his vision loss. As with all cattle dogs, ongoing training with positive reinforcement, exercise, and stimulation are necessary for him to have a happy, healthy life. He is abundantly loving and he will always be by your side and would love to provide companionship to someone who can dedicate time to his needs. For all the reasons above, Listo needs a calm home in a quiet, non-urban, area.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting LIsto, please contact us for our updated adoption form, by emailing us at: \u00a0doghouse@hittgv.org  or download, print and complete the form at: http://hittgv.org/index.php/adopt.

We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY:  Meetings at our Adoption Center are by appointment only (no walk-ins).  An online adoption application is required and must be approved prior to meeting any animals.  Adoption appointments are set up by email by our Adoption Coordinator (no phone calls, please).  This process ensures our dedicated time to the animals in our care, as well as full attention to adopters at scheduled times.  \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

            "description": "George is a 9-week-old mixed breed rescued from a high-kill shelter. This dog is current on vaccinations, microchipped, and spayed/neutered. This puppy is currently in foster care learning home etiquette, kennel training, and housebreaking. We would love for you to meet this puppy and see if it might be a good fit for your home. \n\nThe first step to adoption is completing an adoption application on our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org. Pending approval, your application is valid for 1 year, and you will be eligible to request a hold on an individual animal. The hold does not require that you adopt the animal, but ensures you get to meet and make an adoption decision prior to other applicants. Hold times cannot exceed 5 days. Also pending approval, you will be able to acquire foster home contact information, so you inquire on personalities of specific animals.\n\n***COVID-19 Update: While we typically host weekly Saturday adoption events, in order to follow the CDC's recommendation for COVID-19 protocols, we will be suspending our weekly Saturday adoption events until given the clear. Adoptions for individual animals will occur by private adoption appointment and/or adoption handoff. Appointments and handoffs are scheduled pending staff, foster home, and vetting schedules. Because we are 100% foster-based, adoption appointments and handoffs are only offered for individual animals. When adopting at an appointment, please be aware that you will be taking the animal home that day. We can not hold animals to be picked up at a later date.\n\nDue to CDC's recommended COVID-19 protocols, we are highly encouraging foster homes and adopters to speak with one another via phone or video chat to ensure compatible matches and limit in-person contact. If meeting in person, our foster homes are encouraged to wear masks, socially distance, and choose an outdoor meeting spot. Should you want to proceed forward with the adoption, all adoption paperwork, medical records, and adoption fees are to be completed electronically. Quick and low-contact animal handoff is also being encouraged amongst foster homes and adopters. As always, we include a one-week trial period with all our adoptions.\u00a0***\n\nPlease note, we do not have the ability to process adoption applications at our adoption events, so please plan accordingly. If an application is submitted past 5pm on Monday-Thursday, it will begin review the following day. If submitted on Friday-Sunday, it will begin review on Monday. It takes approximately 48-72 hours for an application to be processed.\n\nFor additional questions regarding meeting this dog please contact us via text/email at 970.699.6772, or contact@bounceanimalrescue.org. We apologize for any inconvenience, but due to a high volume of inquiries, calls and voicemails regarding adoption will not be returned.\n\nThank you for choosing adoption!

He is easy to walk on a leash, knows basic commands and enjoyed the car ride to the Farm where he was loose inside and sat by the window to check the scenery.\nPlease visit http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/ to learn more about our dogs. Click on available dogs to see further descriptions. If you are interested in me, please contact us at information@coastalgsrsd.org or call (858) 779-9149. Don't forget to fill out our online application:  http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/webform/1774/adoption-application. The minimum adoption donation ranges from $300 to $400. This amount only partially covers the cost of veterinary care, boarding fees, and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs and is 100%25 tax deductible. Prior to placement, all dogs will be spayed or neutered, receive current vaccinations, and are usually microchipped. If not, arrangements will be made on an individual basis. Special consideration may be given to those willing to adopt older dogs or dogs with physical problems. Our adoption process begins with completing an application on-line. A phone screening will soon follow, and lastly a home visit will be conducted by our volunteers.",

            "description": "Bill is a 9-week-old mixed breed rescued from a high-kill shelter. This dog is current on vaccinations, microchipped, and spayed/neutered. This puppy is currently in foster care learning home etiquette, kennel training, and housebreaking. We would love for you to meet this puppy and see if it might be a good fit for your home. \n\nThe first step to adoption is completing an adoption application on our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org. Pending approval, your application is valid for 1 year, and you will be eligible to request a hold on an individual animal. The hold does not require that you adopt the animal, but ensures you get to meet and make an adoption decision prior to other applicants. Hold times cannot exceed 5 days. Also pending approval, you will be able to acquire foster home contact information, so you inquire on personalities of specific animals.\n\n***COVID-19 Update: While we typically host weekly Saturday adoption events, in order to follow the CDC's recommendation for COVID-19 protocols, we will be suspending our weekly Saturday adoption events until given the clear. Adoptions for individual animals will occur by private adoption appointment and/or adoption handoff. Appointments and handoffs are scheduled pending staff, foster home, and vetting schedules. Because we are 100% foster-based, adoption appointments and handoffs are only offered for individual animals. When adopting at an appointment, please be aware that you will be taking the animal home that day. We can not hold animals to be picked up at a later date.\n\nDue to CDC's recommended COVID-19 protocols, we are highly encouraging foster homes and adopters to speak with one another via phone or video chat to ensure compatible matches and limit in-person contact. If meeting in person, our foster homes are encouraged to wear masks, socially distance, and choose an outdoor meeting spot. Should you want to proceed forward with the adoption, all adoption paperwork, medical records, and adoption fees are to be completed electronically. Quick and low-contact animal handoff is also being encouraged amongst foster homes and adopters. As always, we include a one-week trial period with all our adoptions.\u00a0***\n\nPlease note, we do not have the ability to process adoption applications at our adoption events, so please plan accordingly. If an application is submitted past 5pm on Monday-Thursday, it will begin review the following day. If submitted on Friday-Sunday, it will begin review on Monday. It takes approximately 48-72 hours for an application to be processed.\n\nFor additional questions regarding meeting this dog please contact us via text/email at 970.699.6772, or contact@bounceanimalrescue.org. We apologize for any inconvenience, but due to a high volume of inquiries, calls and voicemails regarding adoption will not be returned.\n\nThank you for choosing adoption! If you would like more information on our organization please visit our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org.",

Don't forget to fill out our online application:  http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/webform/1774/adoption-application. The minimum adoption donation ranges from $300 to $400. This amount only partially covers the cost of veterinary care, boarding fees, and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs and is 100%25 tax deductible. Prior to placement, all dogs will be spayed or neutered, receive current vaccinations, and are usually microchipped. If not, arrangements will be made on an individual basis. Special consideration may be given to those willing to adopt older dogs or dogs with physical problems. Our adoption process begins with completing an application on-line.

            "description": "Until last week, Nita\u2019s life was one living chained to a post in a dirt lot with nothing more than a dog house. Her life was watching as everyone else lived. Once in a while she would get to go out with her owner to inspect his grounds, but the rest of her time was just watching. When her owner died, she waited for two more months, chained to that same post, with only her dog house, waiting for someone to come.\n\nNita was lucky. She didn\u2019t know it, but she had a friend who found out what was going on and was determined to help her. He began reaching out, looking for help. In the meanwhile, he brought blankets for her house, as the weather was getting colder at nights. He even brought a leash to take her out for walks and get her used to walking. Whenever her new friend would come, she would jump for joy. And then, one day he brought his dog, just to see how she would be with a furry friend. Nita\u2019s entire body wagged back and forth, sniff, sniff, sniff. You would have thought she were in heaven to be able to see another dog.\n\nThe morning we heard of Nita, we couldn\u2019t let her wait another day. One of our volunteers picked her up and made the long trek down to Coastal\u2019s new home. She was so happy to be with people. More than anything, she was happy to be able to run without the quick yank of the chain that had stopped her for so many years. One thing we have noticed about this sweet little girl, she is grateful for every moment of attention, for every touch of the hand. She is grateful for every meal she gets, and she is so grateful to not be alone.\n\nToday Nita gets to spend time walking with the volunteers. She can be a strong little girl, and she\u2019s not yet used to walking by your side. Everywhere she looks, there is something new, and she wants to soak in every little thing. For a dog who has been deprived of so much, her personality shows just what kind of survivor she is. We are so happy that we were able to rescue her.  One day, her fur will shine like the diamond that she is, with the dirt lot underneath her feet and the dust in her eyes, a distant memory.\nPlease visit http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/ to learn more about our dogs. Click on available dogs to see further descriptions. If you are interested in me, please contact us at information@coastalgsrsd.org or call (858) 779-9149. Don't forget to fill out our online application:  http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/webform/1774/adoption-application.\n\nThe minimum adoption donation ranges from $300 to $400. This amount only partially covers the cost of veterinary care, boarding fees, and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs and is 100% tax deductible.\n\nPrior to placement, all dogs will be spayed or neutered, receive current vaccinations, and are usually microchipped. If not, arrangements will be made on an individual basis. Special consideration may be given to those willing to adopt older dogs or dogs with physical problems.\n\nOur adoption process begins with completing an application on-line. A phone screening will soon follow, and lastly a home visit will be conducted by our volunteers.",

His family loved him, but because of COVID, they weren\u2019t able to get him the socialization that a young German Shepherd puppy needs more than anything.  When he became out of control, afraid of strangers and new things because of that lack of socialization, they called Coastal for help.  Meeting the volunteer who brought him to the rescue didn\u2019t go very well for Enzo at first.  He was being handed off to a stranger, not knowing where he was going or what would happen to him.  Lucky for him, his volunteer angel was one who was not easily frightened by puppies, even if they were large with big teeth.  His family placed Enzo in the back of her car.  He filled the back seat, and she just waited for him to calm down, and then she got in the driver\u2019s seat.  Enzo knew immediately just by her gentle but commanding words and her demeanor that she was in charge, and he knew he was safe.\n\nHe made the trek down to Coastal\u2019s Ranch where he became overwhelmed again.  There were so many other dogs and more people than Enzo had ever seen.  To Enzo, the most important thing was to warn them to stay away so they wouldn\u2019t hurt him.  Little did he know, no one, absolutely no one meant him any harm.  Enzo\u2019s team was formed that day, three people at first.  He got to know them.  He would bark at first, but when he learned that he didn\u2019t need to be afraid, his guard slowly began to come down.  Enzo\u2019s leash was the key to making him feel safe.  Sadly, it was the only thing he had left that smelled like home, the one thing that reminded him of the family he once had.  His leash meant the world to him, and we made sure it was close to him at all times.  He needed something to hold onto until he knew the bigger world was safe, until he knew that he was as special to his new friends as they would become to him.\n\nThe day we knew we broke the final wall with Enzo was the day we switched his leash and he paid no attention to the old.  He was no longer attached to the past but living in the moment and looking toward the future.  He began to recognize the friends that he had made, and when they would come to his yard he would watch them approach and then slide his body sideways against the gate so they could pet him through the chain link.   He began to play bow and to run after his ball and do the puppy jumping for joy at the sight of his friends\u2019 visits.  Most of all, he began to relax.\n\nSince he\u2019s been with us, Enzo has also made friends with other dogs and he really likes them.   He\u2019s learning how to play with the innocence of a young puppy.  He would do well in a home with another dog who could help him with both his socialization and be a good playmate and companion for him.\n\nEnzo is ready for his special forever home.  He has made great strides in his socialization and his trust, but he has to have a home that is dedicated to continuing that socialization.   Even though his circle of trust is larger and he has more friends, the big world is still a scary place for him; and for every step he has made forward, without continued work, it will all be lost.   Enzo needs a home that has experience with German Shepherds who are a bit behind in their socialization.  Enzo captures your heart with his soft eyes now, but we will always remember the lost, wandering eyes of the frightened puppy we first met, the scared boy who barked to keep everyone away, and we know we can\u2019t lose sight of the special home that Enzo needs.  That is our promise to him.\nPlease visit http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/ to learn more about our dogs. Click on available dogs to see further descriptions. If you are interested in me, please contact us at information@coastalgsrsd.org or call (858) 779-9149. Don't forget to fill out our online application:  http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/webform/1774/adoption-application. The minimum adoption donation ranges from $300 to $400. This amount only partially covers the cost of veterinary care, boarding fees, and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs and is 100%25 tax deductible. Prior to placement, all dogs will be spayed or neutered, receive current vaccinations, and are usually microchipped. If not, arrangements will be made on an individual basis. Special consideration may be given to those willing to adopt older dogs or dogs with physical problems. Our adoption process begins with completing an application on-line. A phone screening will soon follow, and lastly a home visit will be conducted by our volunteers.",

            "description": "Rainey is not like most dogs. She has lived an unsocial and difficult life, and it shows. Rainey was born inside of an abandoned trash hoarder's house. She was one of 43 other dogs that lived without humans other than a neighbor that would empty bags of kibble onto the porch for them. Rainey had never interacted with people and barely ever saw them until a rescue team came to save all the dogs from the house. Being brought into a real home with people for the first time at 2 years old was shocking for her.\n\nRainey has been in foster care since October 2020. When she first arrived, she was absolutely petrified and wanted to jump out of her skin. She hid in corners, cringed when touched, and did anything she could to get away from the people that she thought were going to hurt her. Though she didn't trust people, she never had a problem with any of the other dogs. Big or small, she likes them all. She likes to be surrounded by a pack. It makes her feel more confident.\n\nRainey has now learned that humans aren't bad and doesn't run when she sees people that she knows. She knows her routine and it helps her feel more confident. She knows her name and responds to it. Though Rainey still doesn't like to be touched, she can be leashed and walks well. She will follow you around from time to time and is curious of her surroundings. She wants to trust this new world, she just isn't completely sure of it yet.\n\nRainey is considered to be a feral dog. She will need someone that is extremely patient and understanding. She will likely never be a dog that enjoys being pet, that plays, or is comfortable around children. Her best home would be a homebody with other dogs and ample time to gain her trust. The trusting bond you build with a feral dog is unlike any other. It is special and worth the time! Rainey will wait patiently in foster care until her special human comes along.",

He is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4516812.\n\nMickey is a young, energetic dog that still acts like a puppy. He loves to play with toys; he loves stuffed toys and chasing after balls. Mickey is easy to leash but will pull hard to get out of the kennel because he just wants to GO! He knows \"sit\" for treats and takes them gently. Because Mickey is still like a puppy, he can be jumpy and mouthy because he is so energetic. He definitely needs training to learn his manners. He doesn't interact well with the dogs in their kennels in the shelter and will need a dog-to-dog introduction if an adopter already has a dog at home.\n\nBecause Mickey is such a young, energetic dog, he should go to a home with children older than 12. If you're looking for a dog like Mickey that loves to go and loves to play with toys, then please come and meet him today!!\n\nIf you are interested in saving this pet, please reach out via this link: https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/foster/BPAZ/Dog\n\nTo actually visit with this pup, please make an appointment here: https://mcaccappointments.as.me/adopt. NOTE: People who sign up for these appointments often no-show, and we have seen that you can generally show up and let them know you are there to meet this particular dog and the shelter will squeeze you in, except from 12-3PM or closer to the 6PM closing time. (Please know this is not a guarantee). If the dog is at risk, please ask for a supervisor to meet that particular dog.\n\n*Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG. MCACC is located at 2500 S. 27th Avenue, Phoenix. Different adoption fees/policy may apply. Please visit MCACC's website http://www.maricopa.gov/pets/locations.aspx for hours.

She MUST be in a kennel or at a dog daycare and NEVER to be left alone in your home-She has eaten through doorways and window screens before when left alone for too long. Lesson Learned.\n\nAurora DOES have some amazing qualities though, so don't let all of that scare you away from wanting to adopt her!\n\nAurora loves ALL people and has a great demeanor around strangers. She loves to go on hikes/jogs/camping and doing anything outdoors!\nShe loves most other dogs, as long as they are not super invasive she has gotten along with everyone she has met so far. She seems to like other huskies best!\nShe has a very goofy playstyle, and booty-bumps her friends! Super silly!\nShe also know when it is time to relax, and once she is past her anxiety-phase of being in a new home, she settles down at night and is pretty easy-going!\nShe is great in the car, potty trained indoors from what we have seen, she is mostly crate trained to a plastic kennel (She is very vocal at first, but mellows out within 15-30 minutes.)\nGetting better every day!!!\n\n***Aurora is not downright mean to cats, she was actually raised around them, but has chased cats that ran from her outdoors and we would NOT want one to get hurt, so we ill not accept any applications with cats (or small critters like bunnies or chickens) in the home. ***\n*** Aurora would NOT do well in a home with children under 16 years old. She can be nippy, jumpy, and protective over her food, water, and other items. We will not accept an application with children.",

They were born the day after Thanksgiving and are 8 weeks old now. All weigh between 18-22 lbs. We are unsure of the breed but these will be BIG dogs. They are all super friendly and playful. They are a little timid at first but quickly warm up and are good with other animals and kids They will be ready for adoption on 2/2 after they receive their second round of vaccines. These are gorgeous babies and won\u2019t last long. Get your apps in on these big chunks of love. \n\nAll dogs have a $175 adoption fee which includes vet check, age appropriate shots (atleast 2 sets for puppies), dewormer, heartworm test (if over 6 months), rabies (if atleast 16 weeks) and spay/neuter! Puppies will be altered before adoption. All rescues and shelters practice pediatric spay and neuter. This is essential in our rescue efforts and it is a policy that we will stick by. All dogs over 8 weeks and 2 pounds will be altered before adoption. There are no exceptions to this rule on all healthy and adoptable dogs. \n\nPuppies/Dogs that are not available for adoption due to vetting not being complete can be reserved with an approved application and a non refundable $50 deposit. This deposit is applied to your adoption fee and the remaining $125 is due at pick up.\n\nWags and Whiskers is an all-volunteer rescue. We also have full-time jobs and Families. We will try to answer all questions and applications in a timely manner. Please be patient and bear with us . Do not contact Parkway Animal Hospital as they are a vet clinic and can not answer questions on behalf of Wags and Whiskers. All questions and comments must go directly through the rescue. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION\n\nhttps://form.jotform.us/70898112177159\n\nFOSTER TO ADOPT APPLICATION\n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/91243748615158",

We are not doing adoptions to Canada at this time due to the border closure. We do not ship animals. \n\nOPHS is appointment only. All potential adopters must fill out an adoption application prior to setting up an appointment to meet the animal. An application can be found on our website  https://www.ophumanesociety.org/dog-adoption-application\n\nWe have limited staff during this time, please allow 3-5 business days for us to process your application. We are screening the applications for the first BEST fit for each animal. \n\nIf you are approved, you will be contacted by us via phone or email to schedule an appointment.\n\nNAME: Junior\nAGE: About 4 years old\nWEIGHT: About 63 lbs\nBREED(S): Pit Bull\nREASON FOR ARRIVAL: Owner surrender\n\nGENERAL INFO ABOUT PERSONALITY:  Oh, sweet Junior!\n\nJunior is an absolute gentleman when it comes to people! He loves giving and receiving affection, and is a GREAT loose leash walker! He doesn't react to other dogs on a walk as long as they don't get in his face. Junior has a fairly calm and mellow activity level, especially for a young-ish pittie!\n\nJunior came to us after getting in a fight with a family member's dog. Junior has had a rough go of finding a forever home, as he was probably not well treated or socialized with animals as a pup, and bounced around from house to house.\n\nJunior will need good quality food- like most pits, he can have a sensitive stomach and skin. We have found grain free salmon or lamb and rice to work the best. \n\nJunior would love to have a fenced yard of his own where he can play with his ball and not be bothered by other animals.\n\nActivity Level? Medium\nTraining Needs? Low\nHouse Trained? Yes\nLeash Trained? Yes\nComfortable with kids? No young kids. 13 and up may be considered\nComfortable with strangers? Yes\nHistory with other dogs? Incompatible, but not reactive on leash\nHistory with cats? Incompatible\n\nAdditional MEDICAL notes: None\nAdditional BEHAVIOR notes: Only pet\n\nADOPTION FEE: $150 for an adult dog.\n\nAdoption fee includes: Spay/neuter, initial vaccines, a microchip, rabies vaccine when appropriate, and one free veterinary visit with a local participating clinic.",

            "description": "Emmy is around a year and a half.   Emmy was abandoned, along with three other dogs, when her family moved.  Little did the shelter know, she was pregnant and very soon after gave birth.  She has spent the last couple of months caring for her babies and has done a wonderful job.  She is a great mom, but she is almost ready to go to a family of her own.  As one might guess, Emmy was very stressed being in a new and strange environment, with the lives of her puppies on her young shoulders.  She was very afraid of people.  Thankfully, she was welcomed into a foster home where her foster mom is very patient, and slowly, the walls are coming down for Emmy and she is learning to trust.  She was just introduced to her resident 4-legged companion, a wonderful German Shepherd.   Their first off leash encounter, it was chase, play, and chase.  Emmy is a mom, but she is very much still a puppy herself.  She needs a home with a very patient family, a family with another confident dog that can help her continue to come out of her shell.    She has been working on her potty training and is doing very well.  She sees her crate as her safe place to be.  Walking on a leash is something that is very new to her and her new family should be ready to take it in baby steps.   Emmy may take a while to warm up, but when she does, she loves to cuddle and snuggle.   She would love a family that can give her the time and space to learn that she is safe and has a family that she can trust.  She needs for her canine partner to be a playful one too.   She loves to play.\nPlease visit http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/ to learn more about our dogs. Click on available dogs to see further descriptions. If you are interested in me, please contact us at information@coastalgsrsd.org or call (858) 779-9149. Don't forget to fill out our online application:  http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/webform/1774/adoption-application.\n\nThe minimum adoption donation ranges from $300 to $400. This amount only partially covers the cost of veterinary care, boarding fees, and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs and is 100% tax deductible.\n\nPrior to placement, all dogs will be spayed or neutered, receive current vaccinations, and are usually microchipped. If not, arrangements will be made on an individual basis. Special consideration may be given to those willing to adopt older dogs or dogs with physical problems.\n\nOur adoption process begins with completing an application on-line. A phone screening will soon follow, and lastly a home visit will be conducted by our volunteers.",

Please be aware that our animal adoptions are NOT on a first come- first serve basis. Our sole purpose is to find the best possible home for the animals that fall under our care.

They were born the day after Thanksgiving and are 8 weeks old now. All weigh between 18-22 lbs. We are unsure of the breed but these will be BIG dogs. They are all super friendly and playful. They are a little timid at first but quickly warm up and are good with other animals and kids They will be ready for adoption on 2/2 after they receive their second round of vaccines. These are gorgeous babies and won\u2019t last long. Get your apps in on these big chunks of love. \n\nAll dogs have a $175 adoption fee which includes vet check, age appropriate shots (atleast 2 sets for puppies), dewormer, heartworm test (if over 6 months), rabies (if atleast 16 weeks) and spay/neuter! Puppies will be altered before adoption. All rescues and shelters practice pediatric spay and neuter. This is essential in our rescue efforts and it is a policy that we will stick by. All dogs over 8 weeks and 2 pounds will be altered before adoption. There are no exceptions to this rule on all healthy and adoptable dogs. \n\nPuppies/Dogs that are not available for adoption due to vetting not being complete can be reserved with an approved application and a non refundable $50 deposit. This deposit is applied to your adoption fee and the remaining $125 is due at pick up.\n\nWags and Whiskers is an all-volunteer rescue. We also have full-time jobs and Families. We will try to answer all questions and applications in a timely manner. Please be patient and bear with us . Do not contact Parkway Animal Hospital as they are a vet clinic and can not answer questions on behalf of Wags and Whiskers. All questions and comments must go directly through the rescue. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION\n\nhttps://form.jotform.us/70898112177159\n\nFOSTER TO ADOPT APPLICATION\n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/91243748615158",

They were born the day after Thanksgiving and are 8 weeks old now. All weigh between 18-22 lbs. We are unsure of the breed but these will be BIG dogs. They are all super friendly and playful. They are a little timid at first but quickly warm up and are good with other animals and kids They will be ready for adoption on 2/2 after they receive their second round of vaccines. These are gorgeous babies and won\u2019t last long. Get your apps in on these big chunks of love. \n\nAll dogs have a $175 adoption fee which includes vet check, age appropriate shots (atleast 2 sets for puppies), dewormer, heartworm test (if over 6 months), rabies (if atleast 16 weeks) and spay/neuter! Puppies will be altered before adoption. All rescues and shelters practice pediatric spay and neuter. This is essential in our rescue efforts and it is a policy that we will stick by. All dogs over 8 weeks and 2 pounds will be altered before adoption. There are no exceptions to this rule on all healthy and adoptable dogs. \n\nPuppies/Dogs that are not available for adoption due to vetting not being complete can be reserved with an approved application and a non refundable $50 deposit. This deposit is applied to your adoption fee and the remaining $125 is due at pick up.\n\nWags and Whiskers is an all-volunteer rescue. We also have full-time jobs and Families. We will try to answer all questions and applications in a timely manner. Please be patient and bear with us . Do not contact Parkway Animal Hospital as they are a vet clinic and can not answer questions on behalf of Wags and Whiskers. All questions and comments must go directly through the rescue. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION\n\nhttps://form.jotform.us/70898112177159\n\nFOSTER TO ADOPT APPLICATION\n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/91243748615158",

This puppy is currently in foster care learning home etiquette, kennel training, and housebreaking. We would love for you to meet this puppy and see if it might be a good fit for your home. \n\nThe first step to adoption is completing an adoption application on our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org. Pending approval, your application is valid for 1 year, and you will be eligible to request a hold on an individual animal. The hold does not require that you adopt the animal, but ensures you get to meet and make an adoption decision prior to other applicants. Hold times cannot exceed 5 days. Also pending approval, you will be able to acquire foster home contact information, so you inquire on personalities of specific animals.\n\n***COVID-19 Update: While we typically host weekly Saturday adoption events, in order to follow the CDC's recommendation for COVID-19 protocols, we will be suspending our weekly Saturday adoption events until given the clear. Adoptions for individual animals will occur by private adoption appointment and/or adoption handoff. Appointments and handoffs are scheduled pending staff, foster home, and vetting schedules. Because we are 100% foster-based, adoption appointments and handoffs are only offered for individual animals. When adopting at an appointment, please be aware that you will be taking the animal home that day. We can not hold animals to be picked up at a later date.\n\nDue to CDC's recommended COVID-19 protocols, we are highly encouraging foster homes and adopters to speak with one another via phone or video chat to ensure compatible matches and limit in-person contact. If meeting in person, our foster homes are encouraged to wear masks, socially distance, and choose an outdoor meeting spot. Should you want to proceed forward with the adoption, all adoption paperwork, medical records, and adoption fees are to be completed electronically. Quick and low-contact animal handoff is also being encouraged amongst foster homes and adopters. As always, we include a one-week trial period with all our adoptions.\u00a0***\n\nPlease note, we do not have the ability to process adoption applications at our adoption events, so please plan accordingly. If an application is submitted past 5pm on Monday-Thursday, it will begin review the following day. If submitted on Friday-Sunday, it will begin review on Monday. It takes approximately 48-72 hours for an application to be processed.\n\nFor additional questions regarding meeting this dog please contact us via text/email at 970.699.6772, or contact@bounceanimalrescue.org. We apologize for any inconvenience, but due to a high volume of inquiries, calls and voicemails regarding adoption will not be returned.\n\nThank you for choosing adoption! If you would like more information on our organization please visit our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org.",

He's a very big boy and could be difficult to handle. He still needs a strong, confident owner to help guide him to being the best boy he can be. He's still working on leash manners and if not corrected he will pull you all over the place. \n\nHe's fantastic at fetch and will chase just about any toy but really loves jolly balls and being chased around with a toy in his mouth. He's very active and athletic and lots of fun to watch run around and play. He's very interactive and loves to he with his humans. He can he great with other dogs his size with a proper intro. He's still got a bit of dog on dog skills to learn and can be a bit dominant and use his paws so a well balanced dog to help guide him would be beneficial.  \n\nHis size, strength, and tendency to throw himself at you for a hug doesn't make him ideal for small children or those with elderly at home. However, he would be great with older kids or with training as he is very human friendly. He loves to ride in the car and prefers to have his head between the seats watching next to you if he can't ride shot gun. He is potty trained and not destructive that we've seen so far and he does kennel well.  \n\nThink you're the family for Nick? Please reach out to us at www.vegasshepherdrescue.com",

            "description": "Are you a white German Shepherd enthusiast? Have you met Cooper?\n\nCooper was rescued from a shelter in Fresno, along with his partner and a 6 month old puppy. A few weeks earlier the entire family was left at the shelter, all 3 were sick and scared and trying hard to understand what they had done wrong. After a short stay at a veterinary hospital to treat for kennel cough and other common diseases of neglect, Cooper and his family were ready for adoption.\n\nHis partner and puppy found wonderful homes right away, but Cooper was too scared and depressed, and for a couple weeks he did not show well in adoption events. Luckily he was invited to join one of our foster homes where he had the attention and gentle care he needed to recover and develop confidence to be the wonderful dog that he is.\n\nCooper is a typical white German Shepherd! He is handsome, smart, curious, and very affectionate. He is also very strong and at times he can be stubborn. He has excellent house manners and adapted well to the family routine. His favorite pastime is fetching balls in the back yard and his level of energy is quite moderate. Cooper is dog friendly. He is respectful with the senior dogs in his foster home, and playful with the young ones. He gets along with both male and female dogs.\n\nCooper appreciates the humans who take care of him, and can be overprotective if not socialized. When adopted, his new family will need to keep working on his socialization. He is eager to please his handlers and will benefit from professional training.\n\nHis ideal home would have other dogs and he absolutely needs experienced handlers. Because of his tendency to overprotect his family we do not recommend him for a home with children.\nPlease visit http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/ to learn more about our dogs. Click on available dogs to see further descriptions. If you are interested in me, please contact us at information@coastalgsrsd.org or call (858) 779-9149. Don't forget to fill out our online application:  http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/webform/1774/adoption-application. The minimum adoption donation ranges from $300 to $400. This amount only partially covers the cost of veterinary care, boarding fees, and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs and is 100%25 tax deductible. Prior to placement, all dogs will be spayed or neutered, receive current vaccinations, and are usually microchipped. If not, arrangements will be made on an individual basis. Special consideration may be given to those willing to adopt older dogs or dogs with physical problems. Our adoption process begins with completing an application on-line. A phone screening will soon follow, and lastly a home visit will be conducted by our volunteers.",

Poor Karly's humans lost their income and home and were forced to bring her back when they had to move and couldn't care for her.  \n\nShe was a very good girl in the home.  She loved her teenage human brother and dad very much and was always ready to snuggle or play.  She's an active girl who likes to play a little rough and can be mouthy at times.  She loves a good game of tug and will play a great round of fetch and even bring it to you most of the time.  She's potty trained and well behaved in the home when exercised.  \n\nShe doesn't love being in a kennel and can be destructive if given the opportunity.  Exercise will be important for this young, active, and athletic girl.  She's a good size and will need a confident, strong handler to be her best self.  Her dog relationships aren't always great and small dogs are a no for her.  She is picky about her friends but has potential for sure.  She loves most humans she meets but small children could be subjected to mouthiness and being knocked over by her strong energy and play.",

He's vocal and fun and loves to play with his humans and get cuddles more than anything else.  He will run and chase and play and interact quite a bit.  He can be slightly mouthy when he gets overstimulated but not too hard. \n\nHe's a quirky boy who will bark at reflections or shadows on the walls outside sometimes.  He has good house manners and is potty trained.  He's the tidiest boy we've had in awhile and keeps his kennel area spotless and doesn't even muss his blankets.  He is not destructive or anything of the sort and is a very good boy. \n\nHe can be strange in his choosing of new humans and quirky about making friends.  Sometimes he's entirely open to it and sometimes he comes across as unfriendly at first.  He's a bit protective of his favorite humans and will guard if given the opportunity.  He's got so much live to give once he gets to know you.  This handsome devil is well worth meeting.  He has not had any successful dog relationships yet, and so far he prefers to be the only furry king of the castle. \nAttachments area\n",

            "description": "Sherman is the most handsome boy in town! He is happy, loving and eager to please with eyes that will melt your heart. He loves sunbathing in the backyard, barking at himself in the mirror, napping on the couch and playing with his toys. Sherman is going to be a big boy and is still learning how to live in his growing body. He is a bit clumsy and sometimes doesn't realize how big he is. He wants to be a lap dog! He is good with dogs and takes the submissive role and would probably be better in a house with another dog. He loves to play with kids but since he is so young, he is still in a biting phase so probably wouldn't be great with really young kids. He is working on potty training and doing well with consistent trips outside and sleeps through the night in his crate. He can sit and listens well and is a fast learner. He is an amazing guy!\n\nSherman is a Male Lab / Mastiff Mix that we estimate to be born around 9/8/2020 and currently weighs 30 lbs (as of 1/14/21) but still growing!",

This puppy is currently in foster care learning home etiquette, kennel training, and housebreaking. We would love for you to meet this puppy and see if it might be a good fit for your home. \n\nThe first step to adoption is completing an adoption application on our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org. Pending approval, your application is valid for 1 year, and you will be eligible to request a hold on an individual animal. The hold does not require that you adopt the animal, but ensures you get to meet and make an adoption decision prior to other applicants. Hold times cannot exceed 5 days. Also pending approval, you will be able to acquire foster home contact information, so you inquire on personalities of specific animals.\n\n***COVID-19 Update: While we typically host weekly Saturday adoption events, in order to follow the CDC's recommendation for COVID-19 protocols, we will be suspending our weekly Saturday adoption events until given the clear. Adoptions for individual animals will occur by private adoption appointment and/or adoption handoff. Appointments and handoffs are scheduled pending staff, foster home, and vetting schedules. Because we are 100% foster-based, adoption appointments and handoffs are only offered for individual animals. When adopting at an appointment, please be aware that you will be taking the animal home that day. We can not hold animals to be picked up at a later date.\n\nDue to CDC's recommended COVID-19 protocols, we are highly encouraging foster homes and adopters to speak with one another via phone or video chat to ensure compatible matches and limit in-person contact. If meeting in person, our foster homes are encouraged to wear masks, socially distance, and choose an outdoor meeting spot. Should you want to proceed forward with the adoption, all adoption paperwork, medical records, and adoption fees are to be completed electronically. Quick and low-contact animal handoff is also being encouraged amongst foster homes and adopters. As always, we include a one-week trial period with all our adoptions.\u00a0***\n\nPlease note, we do not have the ability to process adoption applications at our adoption events, so please plan accordingly. If an application is submitted past 5pm on Monday-Thursday, it will begin review the following day. If submitted on Friday-Sunday, it will begin review on Monday. It takes approximately 48-72 hours for an application to be processed.\n\nFor additional questions regarding meeting this dog please contact us via text/email at 970.699.6772, or contact@bounceanimalrescue.org. We apologize for any inconvenience, but due to a high volume of inquiries, calls and voicemails regarding adoption will not be returned.\n\nThank you for choosing adoption! If you would like more information on our organization please visit our website at www.bounceanimalrescue.org.",

A volunteer was hoping to be able to keep him but unfortunately his chair is too much for their other dog with anxiety issues. Popeye is a purebred boxer around 8 years old. He has and old  injury and has neurologic defects in his hind limbs. The good news is that he is continent. He can even get up on his back legs and go without his chair they just are weak and missing a lot of muscle mass. He\u2019s not in pain at all and is the happiest guy! He\u2019s great with all people and other dogs. Sadly, he\u2019s now in boarding at our vet. He does great there but he deserves a home to call his own and treat him like the king he is. He is a super special boy and deserves nothing but the best. Popeye is fully vetted and altered he will also come with his chair if you want it! It\u2019s pink but he loves it! ?\n\nAll dogs have a $175 adoption fee which includes vet check, age appropriate shots (atleast 2 sets for puppies), dewormer, heartworm test (if over 6 months), rabies (if atleast 16 weeks) and spay/neuter! Puppies will be altered before adoption. All rescues and shelters practice pediatric spay and neuter. This is essential in our rescue efforts and it is a policy that we will stick by. All dogs over 8 weeks and 2 pounds will be altered before adoption. There are no exceptions to this rule on all healthy and adoptable dogs. \n\nPuppies/Dogs that are not available for adoption due to vetting not being complete can be reserved with an approved application and a non refundable $50 deposit. This deposit is applied to your adoption fee and the remaining $125 is due at pick up.\n\nWags and Whiskers is an all-volunteer rescue. We also have full-time jobs and Families. We will try to answer all questions and applications in a timely manner. Please be patient and bear with us . Do not contact Parkway Animal Hospital as they are a vet clinic and can not answer questions on behalf of Wags and Whiskers. All questions and comments must go directly through the rescue. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION\n\nhttps://form.jotform.us/70898112177159\n\nFOSTER APPLICATION\n\nhttps://form.jotform.us/71694695237167",
