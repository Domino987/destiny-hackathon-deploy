            "description": "Meet Spicy! He has been raised in foster care and is well socialized with kids and dogs. He is estimated to be a large dog when full grown (somewhere between 60-80 lbs) and will do best in a home that has a yard, experience with large/powerful breeds, and willingness to work on training and exposures throughout puppyhood and his transition into adult life. Spicy can be a bit reserved at times (he's slowly becoming more adventurous) so he needs someone who will patiently help him come out of his shell. \n\nHis $400 adoption fee covers his vaccinations, deworming, microchip, neuter, collar, and leash. $100 will be refunded upon completion of any puppy training program. Please complete an adoption application at dogsfurdays.org to set up a virtual meet and greet!",

            "description": "GIMMEL is affectionate and playful. He loves to cuddle with humans and play with dogs. He's good with cats too.  He is sometimes talkative when he wants you to pet him. He's happy to play in the yard with a buddy or lay with you on the couch for a nap - he's a versatile happy puppy. Cuddle bug teddy bear type.\n\nThe litter is an interesting assortment of colors and patterns. Mom appears to be mostly Lab. At this age, they change appearance by the week so we don't know what he may be mixed with - so far it seems to be Lab mixed with either Heeler, Beagle, Hound or Cur mixed in - all great breeds :-) We think he'll be a large dog.\n\nHis adoption fee includes his neutering, vaccine series, rabies, deworming, and microchip. He was born on a reservation we work with October 21, 2020.  \n\n** Do you live in our adopting area? ** Do you have another young playful friendly dog of similar adult breed size? ** IF YES to these questions, then please proceed with the application process below! :-)\n\nWe have specific ADOPTION and COVID rules listed below.\n\nRevised adoption policy\nDue to Covid -19 pandemic and social distancing requirements, we've revised our adoption policy. \n\nFirst, please email (desertpawsnm@gmail.com) to inquire before you fill out the online application to see if the pet is still available. (Please do not call or text). We'll send you a link to the application.\n\nWe are unable to do multi-dog/cat meetgreets or adoption events at this time or bring multiple animals to your house to choose from, so please only inquire if you're serious about adopting this particular animal. If you're just shopping around with several shelters and rescues, please let us know this. \n\nIf your application is approved (which \"could\" take up to one week) then we will contact you to set up a Zoom chat or ph call to answer questions/clarify anything and set up a day/time to bring the pet to you. \n\nSince we can't come into the home/yard due to Covid-19, we ask that you send us pics /video of your home/yard/living area/current pets. \n\nWe will discuss with you about meeting your other pets. At the meeting/adoption at your house (outside) please wear a mask (as will we), keep to a properly distanced social distance and have hand sanitizer and your own leash.\n\nWe adopt locally to Central Abq, Santa Fe, Los Alamos and Rio Rancho. No out of area adoptions inquiries please. No young children for our adoptions please. Puppies MUST adopt to families that have another young friendly playful dog of similar breed size when grown. \n\nThe animals are fostered and our foster families like to know their fosters are happy, healthy, and cared for during their lifetime. We appreciate staying in touch periodically (just a pic, holiday card, social media, pics/videos  etc will make our work worthwhile :-))\n\nOur volunteers and adoption board are working diligently with an overload of inquiries since Covid to match families and forever pets. Our workload on the reservations has also increased. We're sorry, but if you email us with questions that are already answered here or fill out an application that does not fit the parameters of our procedures we will not be able to reply to you. Thank you for your understanding on this!\n\nThank you - we look forward to hearing from you and having another furbaby united with a furever family!\n",

            "description": "Meet Riley. His owner passed away last month. A lovely family took him in but the children in the family make him nervous so he is in search of an adult only home.~ Riley is smart and very well trained. very well trained. He loves to play fetch especially with a frisbee, and likes to play with his toys. You can put a treat on the ground and ask him to wait, he won't take it until told, take it\". He knows all the basic one/two word commands sit, stay, wait, down, lay down, leave it (but normally leaves it anyway) lol, shake (paw) and other one/paw. He gets lost in his reflection in mirrors and shiny surfaces. If you ask him \"where is he?\", he goes looking for himself and then barks at himself, lol! It is adorable! He is a watch dog, he will bark if he here's a knock at the door or someone enter the door, He will shower you with kisses and cuddles. He is not crate trained but there is no need, that I found. He is a good jumper and he loves to go for rides in the car.\n\nRiley is around 5.5 years old and 55-60 lbs.\n\nPlease email us at AlmostHome4Dogs@yahoo.com to find out if Riley is the right one for you! (Local adoptions preferred - Philadelphia and tri-state area [South Jersey and northern Delaware] only.)\n\nPLEASE READ BEFORE CONTACTING US!\nWe are NOT a shelter: All of our dogs live in private homes with foster families. Come and meet the Almost Home dogs and their fosters at our Meet & Greet events, where you can learn more about our wonderful dogs from the people who live with them, find out which dogs are on their way and when they'll arrive, and fill out an application to adopt or foster.\n\nWe cannot adopt to homes where electric-shock fencing systems or training collars are used. For more information on the dangers of electric-shock collars, please visit banshockcollars.ca/studies.php and http://www.hollysden.com/say_no_to_shock.htm (scroll down and click on the \"Invisible Fencing Systems\" link).\n\nWe do not have an online adoption application; to request an application, e-mail us at AlmostHome4Dogs@yahoo.com. To speed e-mail processing time, be sure to note the name of the dog you are inquiring about in the Subject line. For Meet & Greet times and locations, visit our home page, where you also will find information on our adoption process and fees.\n\nFOSTER FAMILIES ARE LIFESAVERS!! Can you open your heart and home for a few weeks to homeless shelter dog? Remember, by fostering a dog, you save TWO lives - that of your foster dog, and that of the dog who takes his place in the shelter! Come to a Meet & Greet and find out if fostering is for you - there's no reward quite like the feeling that you've saved a life ... or two!",

Dougie doesn\u2019t like to be grabbed, and will try to nip when feeling threatened. He is very nervous when being handled at the vet & groomer\u2019s and may nip, therefore a muzzle should be used. Otherwise, he is sweet, very communicative,  loves to be petted, is quiet and lays by his owner\u2019s feet while she works on the computer. \nDougie is in need of an experienced owner who is patient, nurturing, understanding, loves animals and knows how to handle a special needs dog that is so deserving of the loving forever home. \n",

No out of state applications at this time please.\nMr. Rio is available for adoption and is excited to find his furever home! He is a 2 year old Border Collie mix. When he first came into the rescue, he tested Heart Worm positive. We have gotten Rio the treatment he needed and he is doing great.\nRio is dog friendly (as long as the dog is not super dominant); cats are not recommended. He is good on a leash, crate and potty trained. He would do well in a home with older respectful children.  Little kids are too much for him. Rio is high energy and would love a family that enjoys walks or hiking! A fenced in yard would also be a plus! He's not a fan of a tie out. This boy has come so far, from a dog scared of his own shadow to a cuddle bug, and we are so proud of him!\n\nage:  2 years\n\nadoption fee:  $350\n\nTo contact Multiple Breed Rescue for further information or to have an adoption application sent to you by email, click the green ASK ABOUT button above.

I was recently returned to MaxFund because my owners didn't have enough time to meet my needs, and because of that I developed some anxiety.\nI will definitely need some crate and basic training with my new family. We also think I would be a great agility dog! Agility training would help keep me mentally stimulated, as well as provide plenty of exercise for me. Because I'm a hound dog, \nI need plenty of room to run around and plenty of activities - if I get bored you will hear the infamous Hound Howl. While having a yard is not always a requirement, in this situation \n\nI would need to go to a family with a yard. I do great with kiddos, but not so great with cats. Due to my current anxiety, I want to go to a one doggo household, at least until I get some more training and work on some of my anxiety. Do you have the time to teach me how to be a first-rate canine citizen? Will you provide me with an active lifestyle and training so I don't get bored? Will you love me furever and ever? Call the folks at MaxFund to set up an appointment to meet me! 303-595-4917\n\nMaxFund is a physical shelter located at 1005 Galapago St in Denver, Colorado.\nIf you are interested in learning more about a dog, please call 303-595-4917 to make an appointment\n.\nThis PetFinder account is managed by volunteers, and the most up-to-date information is at the shelter.\nHow our adoption process works:\n1. You MUST come into the shelter to meet a dog you are interested in (and meet a few others, while you\u2019re at it!)\n                      Our hours are 10-5 Mon, Wed, Thu Fri / 11-5 Saturday / 12-5 Sunday\n                We suggest you call ahead to be sure the dog(s) do not have pending applications\n2. You will fill out your adoption application, including references, after finding a dog you\u2019d like to adopt\n3. The application review and reference checks will take up to 3-5 business days; you will not be able to bring a dog home same-day\n                We only take 2 applications per dog, before they are unavailable. This is why we suggest you call ahead to check the status of the pup!\n \nWe do not adopt out-of-state.\nThank you for choosing to rescue!",

When we found him, we put him as lost and he was never claimed.  He is now here with us at Mayte's Rescue. \n\nTippy is good with all - but if in a home with another dog, he would prefer a chill housemate rather than a really active and rowdy one.  \n\nOpen your heart and home to sweet Tippy! \n\n",

Once we receive it, we'll forward it to the foster family for follow up. We are 100% foster based, so we don't have a facility. Review the process FAQ at our website.\n\nAdoption applications can be found here: http://labrescuefresno.org/available-labs/adoption-application/\n\nAdoption Fees Adult Dog (10 mos. - 7 years): $250.00 Puppy (9 mos. and under): $350.00 Senior (8 yrs. and up)/Special Needs Dog: $100.00\n\nAce - Black Male Mix, 8 years old, 90 lbs\nSometimes you need an Ace up your sleeve. Thank goodness I did. I had a home and was cared for (you don't get my size without a little love). Then I found myself in a shelter where I played my best cards, and wouldn't you know it - jackpot. The defenders of dogs swept in and rescued me, paid for surgeries to remove the growth on my eye, clean my teeth, and we won't mention the other surgery, let's just say my bark is an octave higher now.\nI'm eight years old but still enjoy my daily walks. After a good walk, I love to lay at my foster dad's feet, under his desk, behind his chair, anywhere where he will notice how lucky he is to have me. I even go into my crate just to give him some room. When I want to go outside, I just go through the two doggie doors and I have the backyard to explore. I'm wicked smart, I learned those doors less than an hour after being rescued. I've learned a few commands too, and if you want to teach me more, I'm game. I love to show how smart I am.\nI really am a friendly dude who loves people and dogs of all shapes and sizes. My foster dad says I'm cat friendly but this cat has seen lots of fosters and thinks this is his house! I'll take his word. I am super smart but have never been to school - a diamond in the rough, waiting for you to teach me the ropes - but the hard parts are done! I'm potty and crate trained and know not to chew your things. I love walks and laying by your feet.\nAce is available for adoption through the Labrador Retriever Rescue of Fresno. He is a very sweet boy who is happy, loving and just wants to please and be loved. Ace is an ideal family dog and would be a great addition to a family with children or with a retired family. He is housetrained and is learning basic commands. He is a great walking companion, and beyond that, just wants to be with his human friends. He loves his doggy friends and people of all shapes and sizes. If you have room in your heart and your home for this super sweet winner, put your cards on the table (including the Aces up your sleeve) and fill out an application at our website www.LabRescueFresno.Org.\nIf you have already submitted an application for another LRRF dog, simply hit reply to whomever answered your original application and ask to have it forwarded to Ace!!\nIf you are interested in adopting through Labrador Retriever Rescue of Fresno, you must first fill out an Adoption Application located at our website www.LabRescueFresno.org All dogs are spayed/neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccines including rabies; flea/tick topical drops, heartworm tested and microchipped. Thank you for opting to adopt!!\nAdoption FeesAdult Dog (10 mos. - 7 years): $250.00 Puppy (9 mos. and under): $350.00Senior (8 yrs. and up)/Special Needs Dog: $100.00",

            "description": "Clash is living in a foster home. Submit an application from our website and then make an appointment to meet him.\n\nClash is not eligible for foster and will be a straight adoption.\n\nAge: ~2 years\nWeight: ~45lbs\nHousebroken: Yes\nCrate trained: Working on it! Takes time to settle, but overall doing well with his crate-training.\nDog sociability: Frustrated greeter on leash and may bark/pull/lunge at other dogs in an effort to meet them.\nCat sociability: Unknown\nKids: Unknown, but he can be mouthy (play bites) so only recommended for older kids/teenagers\nIdeal home: An active home in a quieter neighborhood ready and willing to work on training! He is not a match for an elevator building due to his leash frustration.\n\nClash is a dashingly handsome and sweet guy! He is so much fun and will keep you busy. Once he's got some some playtime in, he is happy to cuddle up next to you for a snooze. Clash has been working on his tricks and can 'sit', 'stay', 'lie down', and is working on 'shake'! He has not had any accidents in the house with regular walking. He goes to his \"room\" (crate) easily for meals and with the reward of a pumpkin kong or puzzle toy. He often put's himself to bed at night and after long walks. Occasionally goes to his crate to lay down on his own. Overall, he will benefit from an active adopter that can continue to work on training and provide this goofball with lots of good mental and physical enrichment.\n\nClash's adoption fee is 300. He is neutered, up to date on core vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative. \n\n***We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications. We ask that you please be patient and someone will be in touch via email within 72 hours. Please do not email us unless you have not received a response in 72 hours. Please only fill out one adoption application. ***",

After meeting this adorable guy named Friday, you\u2019ll be convinced Fridays (both the dog and the day) are truly the best! \n\nThis sweet boy is arriving this SATURDAY, January 30th, from San Antonio and will be looking for a foster or foster-to-adopt situation. \n\nPoor Friday was found emaciated and running around on a ranch in South Texas, so he is definitely ready for a new start with lots of love! Despite his sad start, Friday is VERY sweet and friendly! His gorgeous short coat comes from his Blue Lacy mix. Friday is about 5 years old and 85 pounds. He does well with people of all ages and other dogs! He would do best in a home WITHOUT cats or small animals due to his hunting instincts. Friday will need CONSISTENCY with housebreaking as he has been living in an outdoor pen with an animal rescue in South Texas for the past few years. Friday is ready for a new home who has patience and lots of affection for him! He\u2019s ready for Colorado adventures and walks, but Friday\u2019s down to just hangout too. He is completely vaccinated, neutered, and microchipped. His adoption fee is $250. \n\nGo to our website https://redfernanimalrescue.org/ and FILL OUT AN APPLICATION if you are interested! Due to the amount of inquiries we are receiving, we are prioritizing adoption applications at this time. Make sure you\u2019re filling out an adoption application on Red Fern Animal Rescue\u2019s site in Colorado, as we are not a shelter in Tennessee!",

Unfortunately my penis could not be saved after multiple attempts.  I had a P-U procedure performed and my penis was amputated.  Don't let that fool you, I urinate just fine!  The vet has cleared me medically and the trainers said I am a super sweet, playful, wonderful dog...which means I am ready for my furever home in the PNW!\n\nI'm a younger pup with a lot of energy so I hope my new family is quite active. I'd love to be your adventure buddy! I also love playing with other dogs! I can play a bit rough with the other large dog in my house but also know how to tone it down for the smaller ones. I haven't been around young kids but I may knock them over when I'm excited so older ones are probably best. I also haven't met any kitties so I'm not sure how I'd do! I've been working on my crate training in my foster home and I do best with exercise and calming music.\n\nI'm house broken and will gladly share my food and toys with you! I currently weigh 63lbs and am full grown. I cannot wait to explore the PNW with you!\n\nI am currently being fostered in Houston, Texas as I search for my furever home. Once I find the perfect home, Wag Again will schedule me for transport to the PNW. Transport fees are $200 (this is separate from the adoption fee) as this fee is set by the transport company. All transports are done by ground, because those airplanes can be very scary.",

This precious girl is about 2 years old and even better than Godiva.... well behaved, happy, loves everybody, wants to please and won't wreck your diet!\n\nTally has only been in her foster home for a short time. She is getting along beautifully and adjusted to her new environment very quickly. She plays nicely with the male and female Labs in her foster home. Tally is a \"full figured\" girl, but has a lot of bounce and energy. She weighs 67 pounds, but should probably lose about 5-8 pounds. \n\nTally is definitely a \"people dog.\" Tally likes to play with other dogs, but loves to get attention from her people most of all. She is very affectionate and tummy rubs are her favorite!\u00a0Tally likes to get in the small doggie pool in her foster home. We are not sure what she would do in warmer weather with a big pool. If you have a swimming pool, it will probably need to be fenced separately from the yard. We are looking for a home with a nice sized, private fenced yard for Tally to play. She pulls on the leash, so someone will need to continue to work with her on leash manners. \n\nTally will fit best with a pretty active family who will take her for walks, play with her and teach her to walk nicely on the leash. She would be a good companion to kids at least 10 years old, due to her size and energy level. \n\nTally is spayed, healthy, vaccinated and on heartworm prevention. She is house trained, crate trained (though reluctantly) and even ignores cats. In her new home, we think she will be a good girl without being crated.\u00a0\n\nIf you live in the DFW area and are interested in adopting Tallulah, please see our web site for adoption information and application. Our adoption fee is $295 + sales tax. www.LoneStarLabRescue.org\n\n",

Along with cuddles and belly rubs of course!\n\nGorgeous George is somewhat set in his ways, and prefers to live a simple and quiet life without the hassle of any other animals. He\u2019s great with kids but due to his size, literally a small pony ?? WAG would recommend older children in the family.\n\nA secure fenced in yard is required for our big boy to get out and explore, enjoy the sunshine and chill with his new forever family.\n\nSo, who needs a big dog bear hug?? ???\n\nAll of our animals are fully vetted which includes spay/neuter, up to date on vaccines, wormed, heartworm tested and treated if necessary, up to date on flea/tick/heartworm prevention and microchipped) prior to adoption.\n\nTo start the adoption process please copy the below link in your browser and complete the application.  NOTE:  please read our requirements located above the application.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeotmh7qepR0mRvxSqy42yViQnllmR0-FKTFmUo2ANK4AXPaQ/viewform\n\nThank you for reading and THANK you for choosing to adopt!\n",

Please watch your spam folders as an application will be attached and this sometimes places it in there. \n\nHIS/HER adoption fee is $550 USD and that will pay for TRANSPORT, all his/her shots up to date, neutered/spayed, microchip and rabies.\n\nPlease e-mail MuttsAndMeows@Mail.com for an adoption application. \n\nThis dog is currently in the Houston Texas area.  Once the application is approved and adoption fee paid, transport will be arranged.\n\nBecause this adoption will be without meeting the dog first, we will need to try to be extra careful that everyone (including you) think this will be a good fit.  We will try to give you as much information about the dog as we can.  Unfortunately, many are fresh from the shelter and we don't know much about them yet. \n\nLike us on Facebook - search Mutts & Meows - and help even more pets find loving homes.",

Very friendly\n\nWe answer all emails back within 48 hours. Please watch your spam folders as an application will be attached and this sometimes places it in there. \n\nHIS/HER adoption fee is $550 USD and that will pay for TRANSPORT, all his/her shots up to date, neutered/spayed, microchip and rabies.\n\nPlease e-mail MuttsAndMeows@Mail.com for an adoption application. \n\nThis dog is currently in the Houston Texas area.  Once the application is approved and adoption fee paid, transport will be arranged.\n\nBecause this adoption will be without meeting the dog first, we will need to try to be extra careful that everyone (including you) think this will be a good fit.  We will try to give you as much information about the dog as we can.  Unfortunately, many are fresh from the shelter and we don't know much about them yet. \n\nLike us on Facebook - search Mutts & Meows - and help even more pets find loving homes.",

            "description": "Hi everyone! My name is Clementine.  I was born 11/21/2020 and I\u2019m a female, Treeing Walker Coonhound mix. My foster mom says I\u2019m the sweetest thing-I LOVE to cuddle and absolutely love being held. This doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t also like to have fun and play. \n\nI\u2019ve started going on walks only recently and am still learning to walk on a leash but with some more practice, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll catch on soon. I\u2019m still pretty young and am not house broken yet-puppies my age just don\u2019t quite fully understand that yet but I\u2019m eager to learn. \n\nI sleep in a play pen with my brother and we are both pretty quiet all night until we are ready to wake up. I have not been around cats or children yet but I hear that kids are pretty fun! My foster mom says I\u2019m also an incredibly smart girl. Between my looks, my personality and my brains, I really think I\u2019d be such good addition to your family!\n\nIllinois law requires that all of our dogs and puppies be spay/neutered within 14 days of a veterinarian deeming the dog or puppy is ready to be altered.  In order to fully comply with this regulation and reduce the number of homeless dogs and puppies, we do not permit out of state adoptions of unaltered dogs or puppies. \n\nPuppies have special needs and require a home where there will be someone available to care for, socialize, and train them during the day.  If your family is away from the home for several hours at a time, please consider adopting a \u201cteen\u201d or adult dog.\n\nOur standard adoption fee is $375 cash or check and $385 credit card ($10 processing fee).   It includes spay/neuter when age appropriate at our participating vets, age appropriate core vaccinations, fecal testing, deworming, flea and tick preventative,1st vet visit at one of our participating vets, and micro-chipping.\n\nWe must have an application, conduct a phone interview, and meet your entire family to approve an adoption. Please email adopt@safehavendogsIL.org for an application or additional details.\n\nPlease note that the breeds and sizes posted in this biography are educated best guesses and are not guaranteed.",

            "description": "Crisp was found on Christmas Eve day running down a busy street. One of DRWB volunteer was on her way to the vet and saw her. She pulled over and was able to rescue her from 3 bigger dogs that were chasing her.\n\nPoor Crisp had a slight bite on her body, nothing critical, but was taken to the vet right away.  She was loving to her rescuer from minute number 1. She got a bath when she got to her foster's home and she was so happy, she looked content and confident. She didn't have an ID tag or was microchipped, so her family couldn't be located despite efforts to find them.\n\nBlood work came out normal, 4DX Snap test came out negative, she got her teeth cleaned, a few days later she got fixed. She is  8 pounds.\n\nThis girl is healthy and happy, she is not hyper and more like low to medium energy, but she can run!\n\nShe sleeps in a playpen in a cozy bed and does not like to be bothered. The foster puts a pee pee pad in the playpen in case she wants to go, and she uses it if needed.\n\nShe would do best in a calm environment, another adult or senior dog would be great for her, or she could also be the queen of the house.\n\nShe is sweet and loving, loves people. We hope to find a loving and forever family for this sweet girl.",

Weighing in at a big and healthy 76#, he's a handsome stoic looking dog.\n\nWhat's so special about Mac? He is as smart as a whip. This dog learns quickly and can implement without incident. Mac knows Stay, come, sit, paw, down, over, sit pretty, up. Mac knows no, stop, easy. He is a joy to have as a walking/hiking/running companion. He is easy on the leash; does best with a harness. Mac can and will go for miles.\n\nMac is house trained. He is potty trained. He is crate trained.\n\nMac is good with other dogs. He enjoys having like friends. He is fostered with 2 females and does very, very well with them. He has met and played with male dogs and did well with them. His interaction is great and he learns from their social cues with respect. Interacting with other dogs has been important in integrating Mac and showing him a positive spin on life.\n\nMac is good with children. The children that Mac has been around are quiet, very kind to animals, know how to do and what not to do when it comes to dogs in general. Mac is big and he gets excited. Little children may be knocked over until a new routine and structure is met. (6 year old boy, 4ft tall, 41# for reference of good size)\n\nMac needs a fenced yard, that ideally would have a fence taller than 4ft. This is for his safety and is a must.\n\nIdeally, if you are approved for adoption, we ask for understanding that Mac has finally gained confidence in stability. His family decided he had no place with them after 3 years.\n\nIf you have a lot of love to show this dog please send in your application. Patience is a virtue you must have and give to Mac. He's a really great dog! You will be lucky to have his love.",

She is great with kids and other dogs. Cyan needs some work on potty training and walking on leash but she is learning more every day. She enjoys being outside and running around with her brother. She sleeps well throughout the night. She will be a great addition to any family!\n \nIllinois law requires that all of our dogs and puppies be spay/neutered within 14 days of a veterinarian deeming the dog or puppy is ready to be altered.  In order to fully comply with this regulation and reduce the number of homeless dogs and puppies, we do not permit out of state adoptions of unaltered dogs or puppies. \n\nPuppies have special needs and require a home where there will be someone available to care for, socialize, and train them during the day.  If your family is away from the home for several hours at a time, please consider adopting a \u201cteen\u201d or adult dog.\n\nOur standard adoption fee is $375 cash or check and $385 credit card ($10 processing fee).   It includes spay/neuter when age appropriate at our participating vets, age appropriate core vaccinations, fecal testing, deworming, flea and tick preventative,1st vet visit at one of our participating vets, and micro-chipping.\n\nWe must have an application, conduct a phone interview, and meet your entire family to approve an adoption. Please email adopt@safehavendogsIL.org for an application or additional details.\n\nPlease note that the breeds and sizes posted in this biography are educated best guesses and are not guaranteed.",

            "description": "Quiet country/suburban home sought for sweet dog!!\n\nRuggles is a sweet, loving and snuggly dog who was rescued by his current family 2 1/2 years ago when he was 7 months old.\n\nSadly he and his siblings were transported from GA to RI for big, noisy adoption events in pet stores. Those that weren't adopted were transported back to GA and brought back to RI the following month. Ruggles made that trip four times before his family found him.\n\nThat experience combined with unknown trauma prior means that Ruggles is extremely reactive to large truck sounds (think Amazon delivery trucks and back-up beeps) as well as most unfamiliar sounds. He gets extremely anxious and barks if the neighbors close their car door, for example.\n\nHe's come a long way. He no longer chews up his bedding in his crate. He's very trainable; he knows sit, down, leave it (we're still working on stay). He accepted our other dog easily when we adopted him in April. They sleep in our bed and on the couch together. \nHowever, walks in the neighborhood and park are still anxiety-producing for him. Every person he sees makes him very anxious. With COVID, we've not been able to work on that. He has never been aggressive toward anyone, although he has not been around children (the sounds of kids playing make him very anxious).\n\nHis current family lives in Providence in a busy section and they along with the vet behaviorist at Tufts Veterinary School have come to the conclusion that this boy needs to live some place away from the city lights and action - his family adores him but they cannot move and know this is what is right for him. Ruggles is always on alert. If a delivery truck is on our block, he'll bolt out of a deep sleep and bark anxiously.\n\nHe does enjoy having another dog in his home.. Most important for him is a quiet environment without a lot of outside noise - thinking perhaps no children as they don't mean to be sometimes but we know how it can be. A fenced yard is key for him as well.\n\nHis family is in no rush - they want his next home to be the one if it cannot be them.\n\nName: Ruggles\nBreed: Terrier/Crossbreed\nSex: Male\nAge: 3 yo\nWeight: 28 lbs\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\nVaccinations: Up to date\nHeartworm: Negative\nMicrochipped: Yes\n\nBASED ON OUR OBSERVATIONS:\nGood with Children: Good with children, noise would be the factor preventing this.\nGood with Dogs: Yes one required in his home.\nGood with Cats: No cats\n\nAdoption Fee: $475.00\n\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION:\nInterested in a specific dog, please fill out an application if you are interested in a dog. The number of individual inquiries is overwhelming and we are finding it difficult to respond to each one. We cannot guarantee you will receive a timely response.\n\nPaws New England is a rescue, not a shelter, and as such we do not have our dogs housed in one location - they are in foster homes both in New England and in our southern foster homes. If you're interested in a specific dog, please complete a short online application and you will receive a reply within 48 hours so you can ask questions.\n\nAt present, if a dog is listed on our website, the dog is considered still available HOWEVER, may have applications that have come in before yours but it's still too early to know if any are a good match; therefore we encourage you to apply.\n\nNOTICE WITH REGARD TO LOCATION OF DOGS: Please note: Paws New England is a foster-based rescue. We do not have a brick and mortar building to house the dogs we rescue. We have found that dogs in foster homes are much more adoptable because they have been observed in a home setting. Dogs listed with Paws New England typically reside in various locations throughout the south (primarily Tennessee, Texas, and Arkansas) and New England (not necessarily in the state of Rhode Island). You will be notified by the adoption coordinator of the location of the dog you are interested in so you have the ability to decide whether to pursue adoption or not.\n\nDogs transported to New England are done so at a fee of $150.00 paid directly to the transporting company by Paws New England; no additional transport costs are responsibility of adopter. This fee is included in the adoption donation.\n\nAdoption donations cover pre-adoption vet costs (including vaccinations, spay/neuter when age appropriate, and heartworm testing/treatment when necessary), a microchip, and transportation to New England if necessary.\n\nDonations for our young, healthy puppies and dogs support their fellow canines of advanced age or suffering from injuries and abuse whose donations are reduced but whose veterinary costs are typically much higher. We appreciate your understanding that your dog will help others in need.\n\nAll known information about the animal is listed above. We do our best to give accurate information, but most of our dogs are rescues and do not come with a known history.\n\nPaws New England abides by the dog importation regulations set forth in the states of MA, CT, NH and RI.",

            "description": "Meet Hunter! He was born 11/21/2020 and is a Treeing Walker Coonhound mix. He is such a sweetheart that loves cuddling and giving tons of kisses. He enjoys being chased and playing with fun toys. He is great with kids and other dogs. Hunter needs some work on potty training and walking on leash, but he is learning more every day. He is always eager to go outside and explore in backyard. He will be a great addition to any family!\n\nIllinois law requires that all of our dogs and puppies be spay/neutered within 14 days of a veterinarian deeming the dog or puppy is ready to be altered.  In order to fully comply with this regulation and reduce the number of homeless dogs and puppies, we do not permit out of state adoptions of unaltered dogs or puppies. \n\nPuppies have special needs and require a home where there will be someone available to care for, socialize, and train them during the day.  If your family is away from the home for several hours at a time, please consider adopting a \u201cteen\u201d or adult dog.\n\nOur standard adoption fee is $375 cash or check and $385 credit card ($10 processing fee).   It includes spay/neuter when age appropriate at our participating vets, age appropriate core vaccinations, fecal testing, deworming, flea and tick preventative,1st vet visit at one of our participating vets, and micro-chipping.\n\nWe must have an application, conduct a phone interview, and meet your entire family to approve an adoption. Please email adopt@safehavendogsIL.org for an application or additional details.\n\nPlease note that the breeds and sizes posted in this biography are educated best guesses and are not guaranteed.",

I would love to have a human who takes me to obedience classes so we can bond and I can learn those manners. I am eager to please and thrive on attention. Tell me I am beautiful and give me pets, and I will eagerly roll over for belly rubs. I am potty trained, though. Ask my foster mom. She is so proud that she hasn't had to clean up any of my accidents.\nI am looking for an active home that will take me for daily walks, and I require a physical fenced-in yard.\nAdditionally, I would be so thrilled to have a dog friend to play with whose energy matches my own. I find cats fascinating and want to chase them, but given my exurberant play style, a home with cats isn't a good fit for me.\nGot kids? I love them! The more humans to play with, the better! But children over 8 will be better suited for my energy level than young ones.\nApplicants with husky breed experience will be given priority. My foster mom is also willing to consider homes within 150 miles of Peoria because she wants the absolute best for me.\nIf you think we're a match, then go ahead and apply! I am eager to meet you!\n\n\nOur adoption fee is $260 for dogs over 5 months of age and includes all vaccinations, spay/neuter, micro chip implantation and registration/transfer, heartworm test and much more. Puppies up to 5 months of age are $275 and this includes all sets of puppy vaccinations, spay/neuter, microchip implantation and registration and more. To adopt, go to www.fosterpetoutreach.org to complete an application.\nPlease note: Foster Pet Outreach tries to limit our adoptions to an area within approximately 60 miles of Peoria, Illinois.",

She has had 2 months of on location professional training and you would never know she is still a puppy as she is a super chill little lady.  She gets along with other dogs, but prefers to be the pack leader.  May be better as the only dog.   She is an exceptional protector of livestock and prefers to sit outside and keep watch over the horses at her current home.  She is also fearless, as she ran off a lone coyote that ventured too close to her herd.  She is friendly to strangers, but is able to carry herself confidently if she senses danger.  She is eager to please and loves to cubble, but also knows her commands, and when playtime or snuggle time is over.  Daisy is easy to groom, and does not mind having her nails clipped.  Daisy is  being rehomed because of family circumstances, not because of her personality.\nShe can be food and toy protective at times.",

I can be nervous of new people and new things so I'm looking for a patient, a gentle family that will give me the positive training needed for me to blossom into the confident, well behaved guy I know I can be. I'm still young and have lots to learn, but I'm a great listener and catch on quickly. I have lots of energy to spare and love going for long walks and adventures. Once I get to know you I will bond very quickly and want to be by your side all the time.\n",

He's an affectionate little guy who likes to sit by his people for belly rubs, and sometimes likes to relax by himself with a nylabone. He likes to walk (and stand) on his hind legs, and is the King of catching treats in mid-air! Rufus is cheerful and greets every day with a bright smile and a wag! :) He's lightning-fast, loves to play ball, and will even bring it back sometimes LOL! **Since Rufus loves to run, we are requiring a fenced yard, no exceptions!** He's loved every dog and human he's met (kids under 12 & cats unknown), and his ideal family would be one where the humans are home more often than not. Rufus is house-trained on a regular schedule, and crate-trained (though he is respectful when left alone, and much happier when not crated). He's a 5-year-old, Cockapoo/Shih Tzu mix, just a perfect size at 21#! He likes baths, however he isn't a fan of the groomer-- but he needs to go every 8 weeks for the health of his skin & coat.

Scampi is a friendly playful girl. She loves attention and likes to run and play with other dogs. She's very petite, fully grown at 26 lbs and just 1 year old. Scampi and her brother T-Bone were found on the run and landed in a rural shelter. Scampi needs a furever home with a physically fenced yard so she's not tempted to follow her nose into another misadventure. We think she'd be happiest in a home with another playful dog. She's not well suited to apartment living. If you'd like to meet beautiful Scampi, please fill out a foster-to-adopt application at\ndreamhouserescue.org.\n\nAll of our fully-vetted adoptable dogs go to prospective homes for a one-week trial foster-to-adopt period to make sure the dog and home are the right fit before an adoption is finalized. We only adopt dogs into homes where all current pets are spayed/neutered and current on vaccines and heartworm and flea and tick prevention. We do check veterinary references to make sure adopters are compliant with standard veterinary care.",

            "description": "Archie is \"Foster to Adopt,\" as he is still waiting for his neuter.\n\nArchie is a typical high-energy, excitable, goofy Boston Terrier. He LOVES other animals - he has been introduced to large and small dogs, cats, guinea pigs, and chickens at his foster house. He gets especially excited around big dogs, so he does best with dogs that are okay with him being in their face. Archie gives lots of kisses to his friends. That said, he is responsive to being corrected and does eventually learn which animals like him and which don't - he desperately wishes everyone wanted to play with him. Archie has never lived without another dog in the home and we think he would do best in a home with another playful canine companion. When he gets overstimulated/too excited he does have a habit of humping. He will also mark occasionally when he is in a new place or new items are brought into the home. We imagine these behaviors will decrease when he is neutered (scheduled for 2/3/21), but may not go away completely, especially without training. Archie is excellent in the crate and barely ever barks. He loves toys - both bones and stuffies - and shares very well. Aside from the occasional marking, he is reliably potty-trained and regularly \"holds it\" for an entire workday. Archie walks well on the leash and does well riding in the car. If he is especially excited, he will seat jump in the car, but is quiet and usually settles down pretty quickly. Because Archie is so easily excited and will need someone who can help him regulate that, we are recommending kids ages 10+. Archie has pretty great recall in the yard and in the house, but we do recommend a fenced in yard for exercise and safety reasons.\n\nAge: 1.5 years old\n\nBreed: Boston Terrier\n\nWeight: 20 lbs\n\nKid-friendly: Yes, ages 10 and older would be best.\n\nDogs: Yes!\n\nCats: Yes!\n\nCrate trained: Yes!.\n\nPotty trained: Yes!\n\nLikes: Playing with other dogs, toys, bones, and stuffies!\n\nAdoption fee: $425\n\nIf you are interested in fostering, you must fill out a Foster Application here: http://www.greyfacerescue.org/foster\n\n$50 discount for seniors (65+) and veterans. Adoption fees help pay for the dog's veterinary exam, vaccinations (rabies, distemper, and bordetella), HW test, blood panel, a microchip, and spay/neuter if needed and additional health needs specific to each animal.",

Cappuccino would do best in a quieter home, where thee would not be lots of noise and kids. He loves his crate, is terrific cuddler, and would do wonderful for someone working from home. He walks well on a leash too! \nAll dogs in our program are current on all their shots and micro chipped.  Also included is one FREE group session with our amazing trainer to his Street Obedience Class is included and not to be missed.We do not place dogs on a first come first serve basis, but rather to the home best suited for them. An adoption fee, application, and contract are required. All our dogs can be met with an approved application.  We do not place dogs on a first come first serve basis, but rather to the home best suited for them. Thank you for looking at a rescue dog for your next family member!

She had a puppy with her when we committed to her. Then we were told the puppy died. :-( She is one of the lucky ones to make it out. She is around 2 years old, and doing awesome at becoming a part of a pack in her fosters home. Very active and would make a great family dog. Carlyhas just an adorable personalty.  weighs 19 pounds. She is just s super fun  gal.  All dogs in our program are current on all their shots and micro chipped.  Also included is one FREE group session with our amazing trainer to his Street Obedience Class is included and not to be missed.We do not place dogs on a first come first serve basis, but rather to the home best suited for them. An adoption fee, application, and contract are required. All our dogs can be met with an approved application.  We do not place dogs on a first come first serve basis, but rather to the home best suited for them. Thank you for looking at a rescue dog for your next family member!

She was surrendered to animal control with 7 of her canine companions when their elderly owner was hospitalized and could no longer care for them. The living conditions in her home were not good and she lost hair due to flea dermatitis, but her fleas have been treated, she gets bathed regularly, and her hair is growing back a little more each day! She is a happy, smart, cautious, low energy girl with captivating eyes who loves car rides, has awesome leash manners, and is learning basic commands in her foster home.  She would be fine in a home with older kids and likes other dogs that are low key like her.  Gertrude could live happily in an apartment and does not require a fenced yard.  Her ideal home will be with someone who is home a lot to give her lots of love & attention.  She would most likely find comfort in a home with one or more dogs that are low energy and small like her.  She is housebroken, crate trained, spayed, fully vaccinated & microchipped. \n\nFor more information about Gertrude, please email us at info@barkvilledogrescue.org. If you would like to adopt this sweet girl, please submit an application for her at https://www.barkvilledogrescue.org/applications",

If we do not know who the mom or dad is for sure, we guess; we use Gozer, a iPhone dog breed identifier. And, we look at their paws, ears, snout, coloring, and body build. Sometimes we are not spot on. And, remember too that even if you know the supposed dominant breed in your new puppy or adult dog, it does not mean that those particular genes will dominate your dog's personality. :)\n\nAPPLICATIONS ARE ONLINE @ karmicrescue.org",

I am very smart, one of the volunteers has helped me learn many tricks. I know sit, shake a paw, high five, stay and leave it. I'm a bit stubborn so I do my tricks best when I know there is a food reward and because I love treats it's really easy to train me. I can be weary of new situations and places so I would love to find a quiet home with someone that will be home with me most of the time. I'm not a fan of being in a kennel as it doesn't allow me to stay close to my person. I do much better roaming around the house and I'm not destructive or overly messy. I am good on leash and do enjoy a daily walk or two.\n\nA large fenced back yard where I can roam around or lay and sun myself when it's warm is ideal and of course someone that it home with me a lot.\n\nIf you would like to meet Chiron, please fill in an adoption application.\n\nPlease note: We apologize for being unable to respond to inquiries about our dogs without an adoption application.\n\n",

Nothing that a strong pack leader couldn't help me with. I LOVE affection and seek it out often, if I feel like I'm not getting enough pets I will let you know with some whining. Belly rubs are my favorite. I love to play with toy and will run around with you for hours chasing my ball. I haven't made any friends at the rescue yet so I would be best suited as the only pet in the house. Due to my size I would be better suited for a home with no children or at least children 12+ so I couldn't knock anyone over if I were to get excited.\n\nA large fenced back yard where I can run would be great as we do love to play, and a family to teach me tricks and manners, and to go on adventures with would be a dream.\n\nIf you would like to meet Texas, please fill in an adoption application.\n\nPlease note: We apologize for being unable to respond to inquiries about our dogs without an adoption application.\n\n",

They play hard, they sleep hard, and they love hard.\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time.

At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website.

Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only.

Luke is an alpha, a true leader of his rebel 7-pack; he is a strong and fearless \"Jedi\" dog that also has a warm heart and an adorable, playful nature. He is all white with light brown ears. He has a stout build and a beautiful sturdy face. Luke's exuberant personality is a joy and he has a very pleasant demeanor. Luke also loves to cuddle, unless he's off battling the Empire. He wields his lightsaber (or sticks) in his mouth with amazing dexterity and athleticism. Luke is well behaved on a leash and loves exercise, play, and walks, and of course food & treats - making your training easier. He does fine in a kennel, crate, or traveling on a starship. He is familiar with going potty on hardwood pellets, in a litter bin, or outdoors. He is very intelligent, eager to learn new things, and has an adventurous spirit. After a day of Jedi training or battling stormtroopers, he has no problem sleeping through the night. His momma dog Padme (42 lbs) and twin sister Leia [and 5 other Star Wars siblings] have been his life, but now Luke is looking forward to amazing adventures exploring our galaxy. The Force is incredibly strong with Luke!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time.

Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

Typically Bear was scared, but he has always been kind and loving - assumed to be an abandoned working dog.\n\nSeveral vet appointments and prescriptions have been required so far and it may not be over - the vet has mentioned that the 4th digit on that foot is fractured and may need to be amputated!! As of now the infection seems to finally be under control and we can move forward with the determination of how to treat the toe.\n\nThrough all of the treatment and being constantly in pain Bear has been nothing but kind. He welcomes anyone with a wagging tail and a happy Pyr smile. He loves all dogs big and small and all humans as well. He pays no attention to the kennel cats and is a very content boy who tolerates his treatment and just waits for a treat.\n\nWe believe him to be around 2 years old and have yet to find any issues with his personality AT ALL.",

The volunteers have been teaching me so many things, like how to play with toys and I'm figuring out how this fetch thing works. I love to go for walks, the best part is when I get to roll and play in the snow as you can see in my photos. I still sometimes can pull on my leash but I'm working on it and take corrections well. I do have a small amount of prey drive but nothing that learning the \"leave it\" command wouldn't help with. I haven't made many friends at the rescue, it's not that I'm really reactive, I'd just rather ignore them and keep to myself.\n\nA large fenced back yard where I can run would be great as we do love to play, and a family to teach me tricks and manners, and to go on adventures with would be a dream. I should be a only pet home.\n\nIf you would like to meet Messiah, please fill in an adoption application.\n\nPlease note: We apologize for being unable to respond to inquiries about our dogs without an adoption application.\n\n",

I may look intimidating, but I am really a very loving boy. I really like spending time with anyone who will give me attention, and really think I will be the best companion. I am still learning leash manners, but I do not pull very much. I still have a little prey drive, and will need some help to work on. I get along with most other other dogs, and really love going outside with one of my rescue friends Oreo. I am very loyal to my person and will come when called. I am pretty mellow, but still have a playful side. I love to roll around in the snow. I really am a sweet boy, and can't wait to find my furever home with my furever family.\n\nIf you would like to meet Tico, please fill in an adoption application.\n\nPlease note: We apologize for being unable to respond to inquiries about our dogs without an adoption application.\n\n",

I have lived in a house and am a proper house dog but I may need to get used to it again.\n\nI love other dogs and sometimes I forget my size, so I need a dog that is tolerant of me.  I do very well walking on a leash/harness and all I need is consistency.  I would be thrilled to have an active household where I could play and run!\n\nI just adore everyone and everything!  I'm such a happy boy.  Older children would be best for me just because of my size and my excitement to be around people.  People make my heart sing.\n\nI hope you think your home would be my perfect fit!\n\nLove, Roscoe\n\n\n*Guest Posting\n*Adoption Fee $225\n\nIf you would like to meet your new best friend, contact Jeannie at jeannie.3831@gmail.com",

            "description": "Oliver is a gorgeous, big, dopey, forever-puppy that steals your heart when you meet him. He loves nothing more than getting pets and attention. He is between 1 and 2 years old, around 27kg and looks like a Lab x Black mouth curr mix with a curly tail!\n\nWhen Oliver arrived at the rescue, he was COVERED in severe mange- his skin was so dry and itchy- and he was very malnourished, skinny and full of parasites, he had marks that looked like someone had burnt him. Oliver had clearly not had an owner for quite some time and really needed our care. Within a few months he has fully recovered and is now experiencing what it's like to be loved and showing us so much love in return. \n\nThis poor boy has had a pretty tough first few years of life, which has left him a little wary of some things, but he is constantly improving. Oliver went to a training centre and came back much more improved, and we continue to work with him on a daily basis. He is an extremely smart boy who wants to please so he responds well to training. Oliver has been in care for over a year, and continues to be overlooked, we are seriously hoping that this boy's perfect family is looking for him as much as he is looking for them.\n\nOliver's new parents should have dog experience so they can continue helping him be the best boy possible. Oliver likes all our current dogs at the rescue which range from young puppies to calm, older males but sometimes he can be nervous of other dominant males so it may be best if he is the only big male dog in the house. His current favourite friend to play with is a 13 pound terrier named Callie (playing together in the video on his profile). Oliver needs proper intros with dogs to set him up for success, and could live with a dog sibling after proper intros. He would also be completely fine being an only dog as ultimately what he wants the most is his people's attention.\n\nOliver can sometimes be reactive to dogs on a leash, but when walked by a confident and relaxed person he pretty much minds his own business unless dogs come into his personal bubble. As long as Oliver is given his space and is engaged on his walks, his reacting stays at a minimum and can be quite easily corrected with consistency. Right now his foster who walks him uses the cue \u201cready\u201d and Oliver knows to turn and look at her for a treat. Anytime Oliver seems to focus on something that he may naturally react to, \u201cready\u201d is used to break his focus and he responds. Oliver is also told to sit if he becomes too excited and this acts as a restart for him. Oliver's main \u201ctriggers\u201d for reaction are things that excite him, such as barking dogs, someone on a bike or a motorcycle, someone running near him etc. When Oliver does get overly excited or instigated he will lunge on leash and may bark but is overall controllable and easy to regain his focus as long as he is consistently trained. He is a big boy and strong so will need a fairly strong handler for the times he may react. For an experienced dog owner who is used to dogs that need a little extra work, Oliver would honestly be a piece of cake\n\nOliver does like people after proper introductions, and wants all the pets he can get. When someone new comes into his home they are advised to sit and ignore Oliver (maybe offer him some open handed treats), and within a short period of time you will know exactly when Oliver has decided that you are okay in his books as he will simply place his paw right on you to basically tell you \u201cokay I\u2019m ready\u201d \n\nOliver's environment here in Puerto Vallarta is extremely different from environments that he would have in BC, and he does not thrive in this type of environment. Here in PV there are many stray dogs or dogs who are allowed off leash on the streets, which can sometimes be unpredictable as dogs may approach us while on a walk, or sometimes even charge at us when walking Oliver which can understandably set him off. This is not something he would be exposed to in the right setting in BC such as neighbourhoods or leashed areas. In the right environment we know that Oliver would absolutely thrive, as who he is now compared to who he was when he first came into care is an entirely different dog.\n\nOliver does not like children or cats, they are both too unpredictable for him so he would prefer a home without both. \nOliver's new family will need to continue working with him to ensure he continues doing well as a lack of training could result in Oliver become more reactive and undo all of the amazing progress this wonderful boy has made. In return you will get a gorgeous big boy who loves you and is always pleased to see you.\n\nOliver's ideal family would be with people who live a pretty chill lifestyle, and who don\u2019t have too many constant changes as he does best with routine. People who can continue to train and work with him to help him continue being the best boy he can be. Oliver will need a yard, and would not be suited for apartment living. Someone with land that Oliver could run around on would be an absolute dream come true for him. He would be happy to have another non-dominant dog friend to play with, preferably female, but would also do well as an only dog. Oliver is truly such a special boy, it's hard to meet Oliver and not have him steal your heart. He deserves to have a home and a family of his own, and deserves to be in an environment that he can thrive in. \n\nOliver has a flight opportunity into BC in the coming months which may be his only chance out for a while with covid travel restrictions. We are really hoping that we can find this wonderful boy a family so that he can be on his way to his new life in his new country when the flight comes.\n\nIf you think this sweet boy could be a match for you then you can reply to this posting with some info on yourself/ your family and home dynamic so we can see if we think you could be a match \n",

She came from a makeshift shelter that is incredibly depressing and operates on a shoestring budget. So many dogs need help from there. She is one of the lucky ones. Around 3 years old, she is super people and dog loving. Very active and would make a great family dog. Ambrosia weighs 48 pounds. She is just s super perfect gal. \nAll dogs in our program are current on all their shots and micro chipped.  Also included is one FREE group session with our amazing trainer to his Street Obedience Class is included and not to be missed.We do not place dogs on a first come first serve basis, but rather to the home best suited for them. An adoption fee, application, and contract are required. All our dogs can be met with an approved application.  We do not place dogs on a first come first serve basis, but rather to the home best suited for them. Thank you for looking at a rescue dog for your next family member!

My mom is a Labrador Retriever/Shepherd mix and she is one hot mama. It is anyone\u2019s guess who my dad is. My mom belonged to a family and when she became pregnant out of wedlock they kicked her out of the house. A nice foster lady took her in and we were born a couple weeks later.   We are healthy, up to date on vaccines and microchipped. If you are looking for a cute fur baby I am your girl!",

            "description": "Hi! It's me Canela and I'm ready to find my forever home! I've been dreaming of a nice cozy warm bed and a forever family for many years. People tell me that I'm a good girl and they have been actively sharing my information/pictures to find my peeps. My ideal companion is someone who will love me unconditionally and be able to give me time to adjust to my new environment. I'm looking for someone who has a zest for life by taking long walks/hikes and also someone to chill with - lounging around the house watching Netflix. I enjoy running around the yard doing bunny hops, belly rubs, going for car rides, baths, napping in my crate and just hanging out with my human. I'm good in my crate, walk great on leash, obedient to my handler and know my basic commands. I've been on several walks (on leash) with large and small dogs, my handlers said I did a good job. However, since I've been living in a kennel at the shelter for so many years I'm under socialized and haven't been given the tools I need to play with dogs off leash. Therefore, it would be best that I am the only animal in my new home at this time. I'm very friendly and absolutely love human attention. My heart has been broken but I'm ready to give my person(s) all my love, companionship, loyalty and best of all ME!\n\nFor more information or if you'd like to meet me, please contact Ronda at: bigdogronda@gmail.com\n\nThese dogs are looking for homes through private parties in the Los Angeles CA area.

My mom is a Labrador Retriever/Shepherd mix and she is one hot mama. It is anyone\u2019s guess who my dad is. My mom belonged to a family and when she became pregnant out of wedlock they kicked her out of the house. A nice foster lady took her in and we were born a couple weeks later.   We are healthy, up to date on vaccines and microchipped. If you are looking for a cute fur baby I am your guy!",

            "description": "*PLEASE NOTE: ADOPTERS INTERESTED IN APOLLO MUST HAVE DOG EXPERIENCE & NO YOUNG CHILDREN*\n\nApollo's story will break your heart. He was seized as part of a serious cruelty case and was starved beyond belief. This poor baby was literally skin and bones when he was rescued, it was difficult to witness. Over the last several weeks he has been in a loving foster home and has doubled in size. He is a 3.5 month old neutered male pit bull terrier mix who weighs 15 lbs. Because of his difficult past, Apollo will need an experienced family without young kids to help provide him with the positive guidance and confidence he needs. He is a bit protective of his food when other dogs are around, but who could blame him after being starved for most of his life? His foster has already started helping him realize he'll have a never-ending supply of food for the rest of his life. Otherwise, he has been great with other dogs and loves to play and hang out with his doggie buddies. Cats are a \"no\" for him, unfortunately. Apollo is an absolute love bug and incredibly handsome. He'll win you over instantly with his adorable eye patch and pink nose. We cannot wait to see this boy continue to thrive in his forever home. Please help us find Apollo the forever family he so desperately deserves!\n\nInterested in adopting?

            "description": "Lovable and beautiful, Ashley is an adoring family dog looking for her forever home. Ashley was picked up as a pregnant stray on the streets of Arkansas. She gave birth to 6 gorgeous puppies on November 23, 2020. Now that her pups are gone, she is looking for a new family to call her own. Her body is still bouncing back from pregnancy but don\u2019t fret, she is in the process of getting back to her petite and muscular physique. She loves children and other dogs, she\u2019s very playful! We are assuming she gets along well with cats as well, due to her friendly personality. She weighs about 50 pounds and is guessed to be close to 2 years old. She is potty trained and does well in a crate, although not completely necessary if you leave chew toys out for her to play with. She knows basic commands like sit, stay, and will shake your hand all day for treats. She is looking for a forever home, with loving laps to lay on, and a warm bed to snuggle her humans at night.\n\nOur adoption fee is $260 for dogs over 5 months of age and includes all vaccinations, spay/neuter, micro chip implantation and registration/transfer, heartworm test and much more. Puppies up to 5 months of age are $275 and this includes all sets of puppy vaccinations, spay/neuter, microchip implantation and registration and more. To adopt, go to www.fosterpetoutreach.org to complete an application.\nPlease note: Foster Pet Outreach tries to limit our adoptions to an area within approximately 60 miles of Peoria, Illinois.",

All children in the home must be at least 5 years of age. We appreciate your understanding of these policies. \n\nFoxy and her sisters Gidget and Nikki are 3 peas in a pod. They love all toys, people, and other dogs. Foxy came to us with what we thought was a broken jaw but after X-rays it was determined it wasn\u2019t broken or either it was already healing on its own. It is hard to even tell now and it hasn\u2019t caused her any issues with eating or playing tug-o-war with her sisters. Her mom is a 19 lb Jack Russell Terrier but daddy is a mystery. Foxy is going to be the perfect missing puzzle piece to her forever family when they meet her! \n\nLike all puppies, Foxy needs an adopter who is willing to train and work with her to help her be the best dog she can be.\n\nIf you would like to meet Foxy, the first step in the process is to complete an application.  Please go to roadtrip4paws.com and click on the Adopt tab to find a link to our online application.  \n\nHome visits required for all dog adoptions\n\nWe reserve the right to refuse placement of an animal for any reason",

He is still learning his manners but is very smart and already knows sit, down, and shake. Louis does best with experienced handlers who know how to calm him and redirect him to polite behaviors. Louis also loves to go on long runs, play fetch as long as possible, and even go on hikes to help burn his energy. With his energy, he would benefit from plenty of physical and mental exercise, and an experienced family who is comfortable managing high energy, large dogs. \n\nHistory: Came to us as a stray.\n\nDog/Cat Skills: Louis has participated in playgroup with female and male dogs. He is very forward, rowdy, and playful. He engages in lots of physical contact play and chase. He does try to mount at times, and does not always listen to corrections. He does best with very tolerant, social dogs that can handle his rough and tumble play style and high energy. He can also be tolerant of other rowdy, vocal players. Louis has no known history with cats.\n\nLeash Skills: Louis is a strong dog, and pulls a lot while walking on a leash. He would benefit from the use of a front clipping harness. It also helps when he gets proper outlets for his energy. \n\n Primary Color: Black Secondary Color: White Weight: 71.2lbs Age: 1yrs 0mths 1wks Animal has been Neutered",

He looks like he has had a rough go of it, but he is super sweet and affectionate. He also understand how to sit on command. We got kisses after his desperately needed bath. Energetic and affectionate, he would do well with a fenced in yard where he could use up some energy. His adoption fee is $200.00.~~If you are interested in this animal, you can complete a questionnaire at http://www.hbpr.org/hb-adopt-web.html, email homeward@ellijay.com, contact us on facebook at https://www.facebook.com/HBPR30540/ or call 706-698-4663.Thank you for considering a rescue dog or cat!

Sadly she was grossly neglected in that home (she was suffering from a severe skin condition, had distended nipples from overbreeding and had a very serious uterine infection that could have been fatal if we didn't treat it immediately) so it was for the best.\n\nDespite all that, Princess Piglet (we call her that because of the adorable snorting noises she makes) is the sweetest, most loving dog you could meet. She loves everyone she meets (kids, strangers, other dogs) and she greets them with a waggy tail and a big smile. And boy does she adores her people often following them around to see what's going on. And she can't get enough cuddles loving to snuggle up while you are watching TV or reading. She is truly one of the most gentle, loving dogs you could meet.\n\nPrincess does have some moderate special needs. At 8 years old, she has moderate visual impairment some mild arthritis. She gets around quite well but a home without stairs would be ideal. Otherwise, she is the most wonderful companion anyone could ask for. She makes a great family dog because of her incredible demeanor.  How about considering giving this deserving gal a home for her golden years?",

He loves to cuddle and loves, loves, loves to play ball and be chased.  He is very quiet and simply a good boy.  He is on glucosamine to help him with his hips so hiking or jumping obstacles won\u2019t be a thing with him but he does like a nice walk in the park and did I mention, he loves to chase balls.  He appears older but you will see that he is only 7 once the tennis ball comes out.  Groot is easy going, does not get into any trouble.  Walks well on the leash. \nYoung children bother him so children 12 and older would be best. He really is an amazing guy.",

This guy probably won't be a great hiking or running partner, but that doesn't mean he won't enjoy a leisurely walk or curling up on the couch to watch some TV with his new family. If you're interested in this cheerful man, schedule a phone appointment to talk to an adoption counselor today. Primary Color: Sable Weight: 80.4lbs Age: 8yrs 0mths 0wks Animal has been Neutered",

Miss Mavis is no exception! Curious, attentive, affectionate, and bursting with energy, this tri-colored hound to Saving Grace is just shy of a year old. Nose-to-the-ground with a love for her human pals, Mavis ensures to greet each volunteer with a happy wagging tail and soaks up any scratches under her chin or behind the ears that they dole out. She is great in the car and loves all kinds of toys\n\n... furry, squeaky, chew toys and bones!\n\nMavis is extremely food motivated, and while she is in need of some formal training, she is quick to respond to commands or corrections at the offer of a treat! She is a social butterfly and would love to join you on any dog-friendly outings and will be sure to make quick friends with everyone in the neighborhood! Mavis is a sweet pup who will be a wonderful addition to some lucky family. She is also happy to share her home with a feline friend. Could she be the girl you've been looking for?!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

Pepper came to BarkVille after being seized by Animal Control from a hoarding situation with 36 other dogs.  She is shy with new people, but is very gentle & submissive with other dogs.  She is a medium energy dog with awesome leash manners who likes everyone and is currently learning basic commands in her foster home.  Her foster mom says that Pepper is an amazing dog with a heart of gold who has been through a lot and deserves a change to have a family of her own.  She is looking for a home with another dog and a person/family who will give her the time & space she needs to get comfortable in a new environment.  She is housebroken, crate trained, spayed, fully vaccinated & microchipped.  She is HW+ and is currently available for a foster to adopt situation until her HW treatment is complete and she is medically cleared for adoption. If you are not familiar with Heartworm disease, dogs get it from mosquitos and it is not contagious. It is easily prevented and highly treatable, but requires extended rest during treatment.\n\nFor more information about Pepper, please email us at info@barkvilledogrescue.org. If you would like to adopt this sweet girl, please submit an application for her at https://www.barkvilledogrescue.org/applications",

And, because of this, he can be fairly nippy, never out of aggression, just playful! So, we would not suggest Badger go to a home with young children, or he will HERD them! Also, he likes to chase cats. He doesn't attack them, but he will chase them. But, he does do well with other dogs, and likes to play! He is very friendly, and loyal to his humans. Also, SMART!  He would need daily exercise, to keep him in tip top shape, and keep his mind from wandering and being destructive. He's about 2 years old, and ready for his forever family. \n\nIf you are interesting in meeting Badger, please fill out an application on our website FIRST, once approved we will reach out and set up a meet and greet. \nBadger is located in Tehachapi, CA, but can be transported to Bakersfield, for a small fee. Or surrounding cities, for a transportation fee, this may vary depending on how far.",

            "description": "Um can we say \"ears\"??? No body shaming though, we promise...they're adorable! ? Luna is a short and squatty 4 year old spitfire Staffy. Though she has the energy of a 4 month old puppy, she has the smarts of an adult which makes her the best of both worlds. People looking at our \"Stone Sour puppies\" would be wise to give this girl a look too! She adores every single person she's ever met, though she needs practice on not jumping and mouthing when first greeting them because people are her FAVORITE thing in the whole wide world. Cats however she needs to not live with and, though she really likes to play with other dogs, the other would need to be submissive and let her be the rough and tumble pants-wearer in the relationship. A hiker, biker, runner, etc. would find in Luna the perfect athletic partner! She is spayed, up to date on vaccines, dewormed, flea treated, and microchipped, and we ask for people to donate $150-$200 to offset vet costs. She keeps her kennel clean and is working on her leash manners, and thankfully she's very smart and learning quickly! Interested adopters can contact us to schedule an appointment and/or fill out an adoption application here: https://secondchanceas.org/adoptables",

Cora was \n  once a family pet but when her owner passed away she was left outside and ignored. When she was first rescued she was emaciated, riddled with fleas and in bad shape.\nThis mature lady is energetic \n  for her age. She loves her walks and chasing squirrels.   Cora could \n  benefit from training on leash manners as she pulls  and bark at the dogs on her walks..  Ideally Cora would be the only dog in the house. Due to her love of he chase, she should not live with  cats.\nCora is very well-behaved  and calm at home. She`s is fully housetrained.  \n  She  is quiet in the house unless she hears a strange noise outside. When \n  she`s left alone  she tends to sleep on the couch or her bed, look out \n  the window, or just nap. She does not beg at the table and takes food and treats gently. She is not at all destructive and only chews on her \n  toys.   Cora loves pets, scratches and above all else her sleep!  \n  Her forever home should be an adult only home with no kids and other pets, and  a fenced yard with enough space for her to run and explore.  ADOPTION FEE: $399.\n\nPlease download adoption application form at: \nhttps://www.peelanimalrescuesociety.com/adopt-our-dogs\n\nFill the form and email to:\ninfo@peelanimalrescuesociety.com\nThen we could proceed.",

            "description": "Helga is looking for a home with Hilda. We're not sure if they're mother/daughter, sisters, or just plain ol' BFFs, but they definitely belong together. Helga is very nervous with new people, but her curiosity and desire to be loved get the best of her. Her tail gives her away - the more you speak to her in a sing-songy voice, the more it wags and the closer she inches to you. Once you're friends, she shows what a sweet lady she truly is, often sneaking in kisses while you scratch her chest. Together with Hilda, Helga is a lot more confident and playful. They chase each other and explore everything as a pair, always making sure the other is near by. Once you gain their trust, they even try to fit on your lap at the same time. Helga and Hilda are looking for a quiet but active family. They will need to be the only dogs and with children over 12. They need a house with a fenced yard (preferably a privacy fence), so no apartment life for this duo. Do you have space in your home and your heart for two bashful ladies? Come meet Helga and Hilda! Helga and Hilda are Diamond Dogs and will be shown by appointment only. Diamond Dogs are dogs that are currently receiving special training from staff and volunteers through our behavior modification program. If you are interested in learning more about this animal, please fill out an application by clicking here . Be sure to include Helga and Hilda when filling out the survey. After reviewing your application, we will only be reaching out to you if the animal is a good fit for your home.",

He came to SFAS when his guardian could no longer care for him and he is now ready for a new family. Here at the shelter, Rocky has enjoyed playing with his dog friends and meeting new people. Rockys adoption fee is $180 and is a SHELTER HERO!. He is neutered and microchipped and has age-appropriate vaccinations. A licensing/microchip fee may apply. To meet Rocky or to be added to his waitlist, call (505) 983-4309 x 1610 and leave a voicemail message that includes the DOGS NAME, plus YOUR NAME and A PHONE NUMBER - OR e-mail this information to adoption@sfhumanesociety.org. A scheduler will call you back within 48 hours to confirm your request. If you have other dogs at home, tell the scheduler you would like to bring them along for a Meet n' Greet. SFAS offers a variety of excellent training classes, seminars and Trainer Talks led by animal behavior professionals. These are $50 off for animals adopted from any shelter or rescue group! Due to current COVID-19 restrictions, classes and talks are all presented virtually using Zoom.

Inquiries will not be answered at this time.\n\nFester came to us as an owner surrender.  Fester and his friend Morticia have spent 8 years on chains outside and FINALLY were able to be let off!  Fester has not had an easy life, he has battled wounds, cold, infections and that's just the tip of the iceberg.  He enjoys the company of some female dogs. NO male dogs at all in his home.  He also would not do good with a cat in his home.  Fester is a sweet boy that is learning how much he enjoys his butt being scratched  and he really loves warm blankies inside!  He foes take treats very roughly so watch those fingers!  Older kids are probably best in the household for this reason.  12+ please.  He is ready to start a new life with true love.  Can you provide Fester Adams a good home with A LOT of love?  He will need a dental very soon is his future.  We can not get him in for a dental for months so please understand that is a requirement to adopt him and THE ADOPTER WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING FOR HIS DENTAL. We don't feel it's fair for him to sit here for months waiting on a dental when he could find a home that can provide for him. Fester Adams can also climb chain link fences so PLEASE have adequate fencing.   Please research POSITIVE training techniques before applying to adopt. We care very much about your application answers and they are reviewed for completeness and the best match. Please fill out an application on the included link: https://threerivershs.org/adoption-app-2/\n\nThe adoption fee of $200 includes spay/neuter, current vaccines, microchip, free vet visit, 30 days of pet health insurance, puppy book, and engraved ID tag.",

She has been seen by our vets and is on a course to heal her skin, and get big and strong! We believe Stari is a Pit Bull Terrier Mix and will be a medium sized dog full grown.

Daisy is an adorable southern belle who is a little shy at first, but oh so loving. Her gentle nature will steal your heart - not to mention her delicious kisses. We think she'd do great in a fairly calm home with loving owners to dote on and spoil her. She gets along very well with her doggie pals, is a great size for car rides, loves humans, and is going to complete one very lucky family. We don't know about cats. Daisy is microchipped, vaccinated, and being spayed by the rescue prior to adoption. Her adoption fee is $500.",

She would be best in a home without kids. She loves to go for long walks but is also super content just hanging out and snuggling! She enjoys spending time in the back yard with us playing with her stuffed hedgehog. She would be perfect in a home with no other animals, as she does not get along well with dogs and cats -but who cares..she has ALL the love you and your kids need! She was on death row at a local shelter and rescued..now she needs her forever home! She needs an experienced owner who can put her up when people come over..she is very protective of her owner so a quieter home would be best.",

She weighed 5 lbs when we rescued her and now weighs 7 lbs. She is shy of new people but warms up quickly after she trusts. So she needs a quiet home to get all the love and attention. She is fine with other dogs. We are not sure of her age pending another vet visit but we think fairly young. More information to come or email us at codysfriendsrescue.com",

She can be shy at first but warms up quickly. Jazz enjoys going for car rides, she gets into her car seat and sits there and does not make a sound. She is housebroken and crate trained. She is 3 years old and weighs 6 pounds. Jazz's favorite things to do are being able to run around and explore as long as she is able to see her person. She likes to know you are close by, and she also loves her dog bed. She loves to circle your feet and do a dance around you. She gets super happy and wiggly when she knows she has your undivided attention. She would do best as an only dog and no small kids. Probably best with no cats as well. She lives with them currently but has some food aggression so we think she would do best as an only dog. She loves to go for walks on a leash. If you want to meet her, fill out an application on our website bcaaofnj.org",

Everyone would like to be my friend and I will always make time for a romp in the back yard with all my doggie friends. I came to rescue in rough shape, my foster mom said I had the mange. I do not know what that is, but boy an I glad to be better (I was real itchy). My mom says I am easy to teach and i am a good listener, I think she is a sucker for my big brown eyes and waggy tail. Don't tell the other fosters but foster mom buys me t-shirts to wear. She said it is for my skin, but I know it is because I am her favorite. i even have an AC/DC swearshirt, how cool is that? Anyway, I can't wait to have a family of my own, I would LOVE a doggie friend to play with and someone to take me on lots of adventures. I am a good girl, I am learning to walk next to you on a leash and i try really hard not to potty in the house.",

Betty loves to be pet and gets along well with other dogs. Cats are a maybe.. Betty has a high prey drive and cats are similar to the bunnies and squirrels she often likes to chase.. Betty gets along with almost everyone but its probably best that she goes to a home with kids at least 5 or older.\n\nBetty's biggest challenge is her weight. We don't really know her back story but Betty is quite overweight. She has had puppies which may have contributed to her weight but a potential adopter must be committed to her weight loss journey with high protein foods and lots of exercise so we can get Betty to her best healthy weight so she can live a full and active life.\n\nBetty is scheduled for spay surgery February 17th.\n\nFor more information, or to apply for adoption, visit our website at: www.RescueOutreach.com\n\nPlease note the following will be performed on all animals prior to adoption:\n\nMicrochip\n\nSpay/Neuter (unless medically unable at time of adoption, in which case this will be discussed)\n\nHeartworm Testing (dogs); FELV/FIV TeBettysting (cats)\n\nAge appropriate CORE vaccines. Dhpp, Rabies (if old enough)-dog; CVR, Rabies (if old enough) - cat - WE DO NOT ADMINISTER BORDETELLA unless indicated. PLEASE NOTE- puppies and kittens may need to complete vaccination schedule depending on age at time of adoption. \n\nDewormed\n\nAll breeds are best guess from veterinarian based on physical exam. All animals come from high kill shelters with poor access to resources. Once they arrive to our rescue they are quarantined for health purposes and spoiled in loving foster homes until their forever home is found! Our organization is operated 100% by volunteers who give their time and love out of the goodness of their hearts.",

She has been around other dogs and overall does fine with them but can be protective of food and bones (especially until she gets to know the other dog well). She has been pretty good with the cat in her foster home but is a little unsure of it still, as long as the cat gives her space she is good. She is quite the cuddler and just wants someone to love. She will find her way under the blankets with you if you let her and will snooze there all night long. She may bark a little at first when there is a stranger entering the home (some of this could be because of her puppies too) but a few treats and she is easily won over. She does okay in the crate, but you have to put her in there. She is mostly potty trained and doesn't have accidents when on a steady schedule (so it may take her a few weeks in her new home to settle in) and walks great on the leash.

She was the first to eat puppy mush, first out of the crate and the first to figure out how to climb up the stairs, and the only one to conquer the stairs, and now handles them with ease. She is full of personality and directs the rest of the pups who are more than willing to follow her around. She is the top dog! Playful, smart, adorable, curious, and very very brave. Lady Whistledown paves the way for the rest of the brood, but she just wants to be loved and get attention.

She may hide for a couple days until she learns your a safe place. \n\nShe is good around other smaller dogs especially male dogs and doesn't seem to mind cats. Faith is scared of bigger dogs and would not do well in a home with them. Faith is housebroken and crate trained. She must have a fenced in yard. She is up to date on shots, dewormed, spayed, microchipped and on heartworm prevention. To adopt this sweet little gal go to CanineHavenRescue.org under available adoption tab.

The Dog of the Day is the dog that stole our hearts the most, and the prize is...being kissed and hugged. If you're wondering who recently won Dog of the Day...it's Mochi! Mochi is Dog of the Day, Dog of the Month, Dog of the Year! He's a gentle, sweet, sad-eyed almost three year old boxer mix with a heart of 24 karat gold. Mochi came to CCR from a shelter in Arkansas where he had been owned and sadly given up to the local shelter through no fault of his own. Mochi is a big boy at 80 pounds, but he's definitely a gentle giant. This sensitive boy love kisses and sweet talk, and he has a sadness to him that really makes you want to wrap him up in a big puppy burrito! Mochi would be a great addition to almost any home - he's good with kids, dogs, and probably even cats! Don't you want an award-winning dog in your home? Bring home a certified Dog of the Day!\n\nTo meet Mochi, please submit an application at chicagocaninerescue.org!",

Bethany is a tomboyish, happy-go-lucky 2 year old pittie mix who came to CCR from a shelter in Arkansas where she had originally been found stray. At 60 pounds, Bethany is a stocky, wiggly, easygoing lady who loves everyone she meets! We think Bethany will be a great Chicago dog - she likes people and dogs alike, and she has a well-adjusted confidence to her that makes her a great option to introduce to new experiences like the dog park and all sorts of fun stuff. Bethany has a lot of energy and athleticism, so an active home would be perfect for her!\n\nTo meet Bethany, please submit an application at chicagocaninerescue.org!",

For this reason we use variable adoption pricing. By assigning higher adoption fees to high demand moms and puppies, we are able to rescue more families in need.The money raised through these adoptions acts as a benefactor to moms and puppies in our care who require expensive veterinary treatments, have behavioral issues, or need more time to find a home. We often reduce the adoption fees on these harder-to-place moms and puppies to help them find forever families. Adoption fees vary, but all include spay or neuter, microchip, up to date vaccinations and deworming, rabies vaccine at the time of spay or neuter, and 30 days of pet insurance. We also cover hernia repair and cherry eye repair at the time of spay or neuter. Applications can be filled out at mamcorescue.org.",

            "description": "*Due to concerns surrounding COVID-19, we have reformatted the way that we do adoptions in order to follow social distancing protocols. We are thrilled that so many people want to adopt right now, but we are not equipped to handle the large number of calls, applications, and email inquiries we are receiving. We are no longer answering phone calls and are doing all communications with adopters via email. If you have a dog you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application before sending us emails. When your application has been processed, you will receive an email from us with further instructions on how to adopt. You do not need a new application for every dog that you are interested in adopting. \n\nAt MAMCO we understand that in order to continue rescuing moms and babies, we must stretch our finances as far as we are able. For this reason we use variable adoption pricing. By assigning higher adoption fees to high demand moms and puppies, we are able to rescue more families in need.The money raised through these adoptions acts as a benefactor to moms and puppies in our care who require expensive veterinary treatments, have behavioral issues, or need more time to find a home. We often reduce the adoption fees on these harder-to-place moms and puppies to help them find forever families. Adoption fees vary, but all include spay or neuter, microchip, up to date vaccinations and deworming, rabies vaccine at the time of spay or neuter, and 30 days of pet insurance. We also cover hernia repair and cherry eye repair at the time of spay or neuter. Applications can be filled out at mamcorescue.org.",

She pretty, too, with a shiny coat, and playful, especially if there's a ball involved. Leica came into the shelter as a lost dog on Jan. 22 and her family has not come to find her. She is about 2 years old and weighs 55 pounds. She has not been spayed yet, but the vet will see to that soon. She is up-to-date on vaccinations and will be heartworm tested and microchipped upon adoption. Come meet her in Run 857 using ID#626982.\n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information. Shelter hours are: Tues. - Sun. 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. by appointment only until further notice, CLOSED Mondays & Holidays.",

So if you are looking for a loyal companion, then Denali is your man! His mellow personality, ridiculously soft fur and one floppy ear, makes resisting cuddles impossible. Everyone comments on how handsome he is - he's a real head turner. When he's not flirting with humans or warming your feet, he strolls through the house looking for anything to eat. Apples, carrots, bell pepper...even pickles! If humans can eat it, he will certainly give it a try. He's also very well behaved, and will want to spend time with his family. He is very gentle and sweet with kids and wants ALL the attention. A couple or family without other pets, where he can soak up all your love and affection will be his perfect forever home. Be Denali's hero and he will be yours!\"\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Denali, please apply at\nroyalanimalrefuge.org/adopt",

Her owner has lost her house and source of income, so they are both living in a small car at the moment. It is not fair for either of them to live like this, so we need to find someone who can take this sweet pup in. She gets along with dogs but she does not like cats at all. She is not spayed, however, we will get that taken care of asap. She likes people of all ages. Let's help this baby girl find a home that she deserves.

We will only be accepting applications for families willing to adopt them both.\n\nWendy is a leader of the group, the more assertive one of the pair. She doesn't need someone to pet her on a regular basis and is just fine laying with her sister, no need for snuggles from her humans. You can be sure if these girls are going something, Wendy promted the activity. Wendy diagnosed epilepsy and takes a daily prescription to control her seizures. Her pills are given with breakfast and dinner.

We are a specialty rescue focusing primarily on senior and special needs dogs.  The vast majority of our dogs come from the Houston, TX area where we have an entire team of volunteers, coordinators, and fosters. We do also work with local shelters, rescues, and owners.  If you apply for a dog that is currently in our local Houston program, we will work to get your dog transported to WI as quickly as possible. We ask that you have patience during this time of uncertainty and unprecedented dog adoptions nationwide. \n\nLearn more about Albert's Dog Lounge, our mission, and adoption policies by visiting Albertsdoglounge.org. \n\nOur process includes an approved application, reference checks, a homevisit, and then a meet and greet with the dog. Adoption fee is $500 for a bonded pair.\n\nBegin your application process by copying this link into your web browser: https://www.albertsdoglounge.org/apply\n\nWI Dept.

Great! We have an adoption process that tries to ensure that our LLR animals have found their forever home. Adopting from LLR isn\u2019t the fastest process. We do not have a paid staff and rely on volunteers-for everything. From animal care, and veterinary appointments to checking emails, answering phone calls and scheduling all meet n greets! Please be patient with us, animals come first around here. We are not in a rush to place any of the animals in LLR. All of our animals live in foster homes comfortably which means that we can take our time to find the best possible home for each animal in our care. \n\nTo learn more about the Little Lotus adoption process, please go to:\nhttps://littlelotusrescueandsanctuary.org/adoption-process/\n\nFor an application to meet this pet, please go to:https://littlelotusrescueandsanctuary.org/adoption-application/\n\nBeing fostered in Sierra Vista, AZ.

            "description": "To be considered for adopting a dog from Canine Lifeline, you must have an approved application must be on file. Please visit http://www.caninelifeline.org/adoption-process/ for more information about our adoption process and to submit an online application.\n\nMeet Buddy, a painfully shy 3 year-old Husky/Beagle mix male who's looking for a quiet home where he can truly relax and enjoy life. This little guy came into an overcrowded county dog shelter and was very frightened there. He made the trip to Canine Lifeline so he could take his time finding the perfect new home. We don't have any history on Buddy's pre-shelter life but he is extremely shy when meeting new people and in new situations. Buddy is very comfortable around other dogs though so he is going to need a home where he'll have a canine buddy who will show him the ropes and help boost his confidence when he's uncertain about things. Although it takes him awhile to warm up to new people, Buddy is a great friend once he's comfortable with someone. He's very friendly and affectionate with his foster mom and loves to give lots of kisses. Buddy is still very unsure of himself on a leash and tends to stick close to his handler making it very difficult to walk with him. Having a canine walking buddy will help him in this area as well as he begins to realize how enjoyable walking on a leash is. Given his shyness, Buddy is going to need a home in a quiet neighborhood with a yard that has a secure aboveground fence. Urban or high-density suburban living would be very frightening for him. We're looking forward to seeing this sweet boy thrive and blossom in his new home! Buddy weighs about 32 pounds and his adoption fee is $325. He's neutered, heartworm negative and on monthly preventative, up to date on vaccinations including bivalent canine influenza, wormed, on flea and tick preventative, and microchipped. As part of the adoption process, all adopters must commit to a two-week adjustment period to make sure it's a great match before the adoption is finalized. Please email info@caninelifeline.org if you're interested in Buddy. An approved application is required before we schedule meets with any of our dogs. Please note that we don't place our dogs in homes with children under 7 years of age. We correspond via email so please check your junkmail or spam folder to make sure our reply hasn't landed in there. Please visit our website at www.caninelifeline.org to see more photos of Buddy and to submit an online application if you live in Northeast OH.",

If you are interested in learning more about Sissy, please complete an application and then reach out to Roxy@bigfluffydogs.com\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please apply online, at https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/. \n\nOur main website, www.bigfluffydogs.com has more information about us and the rescue process. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters should understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. Homes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for 1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (i.e. a 4-month-old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break). 2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise. 3.) Socialization.  The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home. 4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded ten-fold, for years to come.  Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy.  Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time-consuming and can be expensive. All dogs require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well-socialized dog is more than worth the effort to get them there.",

She loves everyone, every toy, and all the dogs she has met. She will be a fabulous addition to her forever home!  \n\nLike all puppies, Gidget needs an adopter who is willing to train and work with her to help her be the best dog she can be.\n\nIf you would like to meet Gidget, the first step in the process is to complete an application.  Please go to roadtrip4paws.com and click on the Adopt tab to find a link to our online application.  \n\nHome visits required for all dog adoptions\n\nWe reserve the right to refuse placement of an animal for any reason",

He is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4521090.\n\nBooker is a handsome young 3 year old pup looking for his furever home! Booker loves treats and is very treat motivated, he is also leash trained for the most part but could still use a little extra training there. He appears to be leash trained, but is overly stimulated at the shelter so he gets excited and jumps. Many dogs are anxious at the shelter though, is this a reason to put him down?? Booker is looking for an experienced foster or adopter, he was very scared when he first got to the shelter and bit a handler. This has not happened since and he's been nothing but friendly and seeking love and pets. He'll need an owner who will give him time to decompress and calm down once outside of the shelter. Will you save this handsome boy's life and open your home to him?\n\nTo visit with this pup, please make an appointment here: https://mcaccappointments.as.me/adopt. NOTE: People who sign up for these appointments often no-show. We have been told that you can go straight to the shelter and let them know you are there to meet this particular dog. From what we understand, the shelter will squeeze you in. (Please know this is not a guarantee). We hope your adoption process is smooth and full of happiness. *Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG. MCACC is located at 2500 S. 27th Avenue, Phoenix. Different adoption fees/policy may apply. Please visit MCACC's website http://www.maricopa.gov/pets/locations.aspx for hours. You may also wish to call 602-506-7387 (PETS) and provide the animal's A# above to verify is still available.\n\nIf you are interested in saving this pet, please reach out via this link: https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/foster/BPAZ/Dog\n\n*Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG.",

            "description": "Personality: Comet is a fun, energetic, playful & goofy boy. He is very social and is wiggly when meeting new people. He likes the outdoors and enjoys going on long walks and runs. He would benefit from daily physical and mental exercise. He would do well with a family that has some herding breed experience. He also loves going to the beach and playing in the sand. As energetic as he is, Comet also loves to curl up and relax with you. He is very intelligent and easy to train. He picks up commands quickly and is already good with the basics. Comet did well in his foster home with a routine potty schedule. He also did well getting left alone when provided exercises and had his bed and chew toys to keep him occupied. My care has been sponsored by Pallavi Akella!\n\nHistory: Comet came to us from the central valley. \n\nDog Skills/Cat Skills: Comet is a very excitable dog, that he can be to forward for more reserved and shy dogs who prefer space and time to warm up. Comet tends to be vocal and bossy in play with dogs, and will pick on less confident dogs. Comet does enjoy chase and physical contact play, but has shown to escalate corrections from other dogs. He may do best as an only dog, but has also shown to tolerate and play with females that are calm, social, polite, and playful, who can tolerate his very vocal, pushy play style. At this time comet has shown to only do well meeting other dogs on a loose leash walk, before being able to play. Comet has shown hyper focus on cats, and adopters should be aware of breed tendencies.\n\n\nLeash Skills: Comet pulls while walking on a leash and would benefit from the use of a front clipping harness. \n\nReady to meet Comet?

            "description": "Phantom was aptly named because of her striking blue eye.  Isn't she gorgeous?  And this girl has a gorgeous spirit about her when you know all she's been through.  This girl came to us having had surgery to repair a broken hip and broken legs (probably due to being hit by a car).  Somehow the vet decided not to spay her though and, lo and behold, a month later she was back at a vet to have an emergency c-section because she was in labor!  Thank God there were only three BIG pups and they were all healthy!  Can you imagine her pushing big pups out a broken pelvis???\n\nWell, now that the pups are old enough to find new families, and her bones are healed, this beauty is ready for a new home of her own.  \n\nPhantom is a sweet and gentle soul that wants to please people  We believe she has some Aussie in her and maybe Tibetan Spaniel but really don't know.  Whatever she is, she is beautiful in side and out.  \n\nIf you are looking for a beautiful and gentle soul that just wants to make you happy then Phantom may be the dog you're looking for.  Read on or go to the adoptiin process page of our website, throwmeabonedogrescue.org, to apply.  \n\nAll potential adopters are expected to complete an application and provide pictures of their yard, patio, and/or balcony making sure we can see the fence line and/or railing.  The application can be completed and submitted from our website - throwmeabonedogrescue.org - the link is found of the Adoption Process page.  Applications will be reviewed for approval before setting an appointment to come meet and possibly adopt the dog of interest.  In addition, those who live in a rental property are expected to provide proof that they are allowed to have a dog where they live.\n\nEach of our rescued dogs has been de-wormed if necessary, de-flea'd (with topical treatment if old enough, and by medicated bath if too young), spayed/neutered, microchipped, is up to date on shots, and has been fully examined by a veterinarian.  In addition, each adopted dog comes with a starter baggie of the food it has been eating, a few treats for training purposes, a rawhide chew, a lead and collar, and a folder containing pertinent records.",

If you have a big home, I will be sure to secure the perimeter for you, as I love exploring new places. Im very affectionate with the people that I love, and I would love to meet new people! Oh, one more thing - did I mention that I love food? I will be your BFF if you have any chicken or hotdogs to spare! Anyways, what do you say, are you ready to bring this amazing bundle of joy into your life? Adopt me, Aiden, today!",

This 2-year-old lab mix still acts like a wild puppy and is looking for someone with the time, patience, and experience to help him be successful. Dalton has started positive reinforcement training at the shelter, and hes working on potty training, leash skills, remaining calm around other dogs, and manners overall. Dalton is incredibly food motivated, so hell be a fun dog for an adopter who is committed to treat-based training. He also loves toys and bones, but he can be a bit intense around his prized possessions, so he would greatly benefit from working on trade and drop it. Because of this intensity and his other training needs, Dalton would do best as an only pet in a home without young kids. If youre looking for an affectionate, active project dog, Dalton could be the one for you! Do you think youre ready to take on this crazy goofball?",

I can be hesitant with people I don't know, so I'm more of a homebody than social butterfly. I'm hoping to find a low-traffic home that will suit my quiet personality. I am an athletic dog and I need a home that will give me plenty of exercise. Due to my fearfulness, I will need a home with no children under the age of 12. I tend to get noisy when left a lone so I must go to a house rather than an apartment. I will need to meet all household residents, including dogs, before going to my forever home. Poe will be shown by appointment only. If you are interested in learning more about this animal, please fill out an application by clicking here . Be sure to include Poe A1366612 when filling out the survey. After reviewing your application, we will only be reaching out to you if the animal is a good fit for your home.",

As a young husky mix, Daphne definitely needs an adopter prepared to put serious work intro training and make sure she has lots of mental and physical stimulation. She is very smart and is improving with house-breaking and leash walking, but will need to continue working on these with her adopter. She is a high energy lady and is happiest with several exercise sessions a day, and a structured environment in the home. Daphne is very friendly and has so far loved every person and dog she's met! She needs to work on not jumping up to say hi and containing her excitement when she meets a new person. With a regular exercise and training routine, she'll be a wonderful companion for an active adopter! Approved adopters interested in Daphne can email adopt@heartsandbonesrescue.com for more info. If you're not approved yet, apply today at heartsandbonesrescue.com.",

            "description": "Patches was originally transferred to THS from the Lucas County Canine Care and Control, where she was there for over a year during a pending court case with her previous owner. She spent some time in foster and her family had nothing but wonderful things to say about her! Patches loves people, and is a huge couch potato! She snorts like a pig when sniffing around on walks, and even snores! Patches is a people person, and needs to go home as an only pet as she is not friendly with other animals. She was able to spend this holiday season in a home with multiple family members that ranged in age from 9-18. She adored everyone, and really enjoyed snuggling up to all of her new friends!\n\nFor 2021, Patches has made it her personal goal to not only find her forever family, but look good doing it! Her foster mom worked hard on cutting back on her food, and took her on regular walks. After she's done exercising, Patches enjoys cuddling up at her foster mom's feet while she works! \n\nPatches was brought back to THS recently because her new family was unable to care for her, so at no fault of her own! Ready for her second chance, Patches is still looking for the perfect fit! Could it be you??\n\nEmail foster@toledohumane.org if you're interested in adopting!",

This young girl loves people but would need to be the only animal in the home as she was never properly socialized or trained. Pepper would benefit from an experienced owner who can provide training and structure to this diamond in the rough.\n\nPlease note that only experienced dog owners and homes with no children or other pets will be considered as she is high-energy and dog/cat reactive. \n\nCheck out the video of Pepper from a recent play session! Meet her at our Costa Mesa location.\n\n---\nWe know there are some 3rd party websites giving mis-information on the location of the pet you may be interested in. For correct information, please visit the location of the animal's name listed directly after their name, and visit the bio for more information. Thank you!! (Ex: \"Sparky - Chino Hills Location will mean you go to Chino Hills; \"Fluffy - Claremont Location will mean you go to Claremont; and \"Fido - Costa Mesa Location will mean you go to Costa Mesa) There may also be mis-information about the status of an available pet. If the animal is no longer listed on our main website, it is no longer available for adoption. For accurate information please visit pricelesspetrescue.org",

            "description": "LEARNING TO TRUST:  2 years old / 20 lbs. \n\nHi, my name\u2019s Lynley! I had a home, but there were simply too many dogs in the home for us to all get the love, socialization, and attention we deserve, so Mostly Mutts is helping me find new families to love and be loved by!     \n\n\u2022 OTHER DOGS/CATS/KIDS:  There were several dogs in my previous home, and I came in with two other dogs who have already been adopted, and we get along fine.  Otherwise, I haven\u2019t really cared for the dogs I\u2019ve met at MM\u2019s, though I\u2019m new and it\u2019s a bit overwhelming, so if you have a dog at home already, let\u2019s meet / My previous owner reported that I got along fine with cats, so if you have a dog-friendly kitty, let\u2019s meet / I haven\u2019t met kids yet at Mostly Mutts, and I would not like kids to run up to me or pick me up until I really trusted them, so if you have much older calm kids, let\u2019s meet.\n\n\u2022 PERSONALITY/ENERGY LEVEL:  Initially, I was very skittish and did not want to leave my room at all.  The shelter volunteers began to work their magic \u2013 sitting with me, spending time with me and letting me set the pace for interaction.  I\u2019ve begun to warm up and build my trust in people\u2026even nudging them for nice pettings now and following them a bit.  My loving side is emerging, and I am even learning about toys and having a lot of fun with them!  I just need a patient family that will give me a little time to know that they will love me, and I\u2019ll return the love.  If I\u2019m rushed, I may give a little growl and show my teeth, just to tell you to slow down / My former owner said I was \u2018high energy\u2019, but the volunteers who care for me say I have more of a medium energy level (4-6).\n\n\u2022 SKILLS/CRATE/POTTY:  I am now a student in the Mostly Mutts University training program, where I am learning lots of great doggie commands with my trainer.  So far, I have mastered \u2018sit\u2019 and \u2018come\u2019.  I walk well on my leash and - right now, we are working on building my confidence outside of my kennel.  I am gaining more confidence every day, and just love my training sessions and the time I get to spend with my trainer, so check back to see my progress / I was not crated in my former home, and my crate manners are good at Mostly Mutts, as I am venturing out of my room more and more.  My room is my safe spot so I may want a crate in my new home / Since getting used to going outside, my potty habits have been good on the shelter schedule.  I was reportedly potty trained in my former home, so hopefully that will be the case in my new home.\n\n\u2022 LIKES/DISLIKES:  I just love playing with toys \u2013 I don\u2019t know if I knew what they were, but I do now!  Once I know you are my friend, I enjoy cuddles and neck rubs.   I am also finding out that I like laps.  I warm up quickest to quiet natured people.  Bits of Pup-peronis in my food has made it tastier for me / I have not been crazy about walking on the grass while on my walks, and my trainer is working with me on this.\n\n\u2022 MEDICAL:   I'm current on vaccinations, micro-chipped and spayed. I have a cute half tail \u2013 I think I was born that way.\n\nI am looking for patient and calm natured family who will continue to help me grow my trust in a wonderful home!  My adoption fee is $299.00, and I\u2019m located in Kennesaw, Ga.",

            "description": "\u2018BOND\u2019 THEMED MOMMA:  5 years old / 49 lbs. \n\nHi, my name is Moneypenny \u2013 momma to the \u2018Bond\u2019 themed puppies who have all been adopted!  I was at animal control \u2013 pregnant and heartworm positive with cherry eye.  I needed a hero, Mostly Mutts became just that and rescued me.  I went to a great foster home, where I gave birth to and raised my puppies.  Now, it\u2019s my turn to find a great family to love! \n\n\u2022 OTHER DOGS/CATS/KIDS:  I\u2019ve had mixed interactions with the dogs in my previous foster home where I raised my babies.  Perhaps my hormones were still high from pregnancy and nursing, so I would need a meet and greet to see if we will be friends if there is another dog in my prospective home / Cats unknown / I also haven\u2019t met kids yet at Mostly Mutts, so let\u2019s meet and best no toddlers that I may bump over.\n\n\u2022 PERSONALITY/ENERGY LEVEL:  I am a loving girl who is very social with my people.  My former foster describes me as an \u2018amazing\u2019 dog.  I have a very expressive face and it seems I am smiling when I am happy \u2013 so cute!  I am affectionate and readily seek out attention. I am a bit playful too / My current energy level is about 3-5, but that will likely increase after my heartworm treatment is completed.\n\n\u2022 SKILLS/CRATE/POTTY:  I am now in the Mostly Mutts University training program and am a pretty smart gal.  I have already learned the following skills: \u2018sit\u2019, \u2018down\u2019, and \u2018come\u2019.  I will occasionally give my paw too.  Since I am a treat fan, I bet you can reinforce these skills and teach me even more / My crate manners are good at the shelter.  I did not use a crate in my foster home, since I had my puppies / I used pee pads in my foster home initially, as I did not like going outside, but after a little while I eventually started going out on a good schedule and I\u2019m doing pretty well on the shelter schedule too, so \u2013 keep me on a good schedule so my potty skills will be reinforced in my new home. \n\n\u2022 LIKES/DISLIKES:  I love people and attention - especially belly rubs (and usually will roll over for one as soon as I am outside).  I have discovered tennis balls but don\u2019t play with them much yet since I do need to stay calmer until after my heartworm treatment is completed. I tend to play independently or enjoy spending time chewing on nice bone.  Food and treats are also on my \u2018favorites\u2019 list / I don\u2019t like to be left alone, as I am a real people dog.  Initially, I was not crazy about going outside, so I may need encouragement in this area in my new home.\n\n\u2022 MEDICAL:   I'm current on vaccinations, micro-chipped and spayed.  Unfortunately, my previous owner did not keep me on a monthly heartworm preventative, so I am heartworm positive.  Mostly Mutts will cover the cost of my treatment with their vet, so local adoption only. I\u2019ve had my cherry eye surgery now, so I have a couple of weeks of eye meds and wearing a cone and I should be good in that area.\n\nI am looking for a loving family to give me a wonderful home!  My adoption fee is $299.00, and I\u2019m located in Kennesaw, Ga.",

This girl recently had a litter (Cedar and Hickory) and was the best mama and now she\u2019s ready to reclaim her days! She is mellow and super easy-going. Her gentle and calm spirit makes her an amazing work-from-home buddy, a great partner for daily walks, and the best company for movie night! She is still timid and working on building her confidence around other pups\u2014 she\u2019s friendly with them but gets a little scared. We think she might do well with another pup that can give her space to warm up and allows her to maintain her slower-paced lifestyle.",

He is already neutered and has had some skin issues that have improved a great deal in the last few months.  He will always need good quality food, flea control,  and regular Vet checks to keep his skin in the best shape.  He does come with his Vet info, so you will know what to expect.  Rocky is a super sweet boy and will make a great companion.  His adoption fee is only $60 and he can go home today.\n\nWe are open by appointment only so please call 360-740-1290 to schedule a time to visit.",

We are pretty sure he was a cheetah in a past life! He was found as a stray and brought to a humane society that we work with and we're so happy we could take him in. \n\nA home with a large fenced in yard would be ideal for this energetic boy. Leash walks are great, but he will also need plenty of space to zoom around unleashed and burn off energy. His tail is super long and he wags it in a propeller-like motion. This may be how he reaches hypersonic speed! When he is out and about his mind is focused on playing and running, so he has no time for cuddles. Once he's relaxed and has gotten some energy out, he wants to rest on your lap to get some love and attention. \n\nWith the number 74 branded on both sides, it's likely he was a working dog and that explains why he enjoys running in our fields so much. The brands are starting to fade, but his desire to run is still strong and his heart is full of happiness with each stride he takes. \n\nDoes this flying Arrow sound like the one you've been dreaming of?",

            "description": "Lucy is a young 1-2 yr old Wire Hair Terrier Mix that was dumped at a lawn care company in Central Louisiana. She was very leary to come to the people trying to rescue her but we soon found that she was highly food motivated.\u00a0\u00a0Lucy has to build your trust and is initially standoffish of you.\u00a0She will need you to\u00a0let her come to you and when she\u2019s ready she will be in your lap.\u00a0\u00a0Reaching down or towards her from a standing position frightens her , again until she is trusting. She was heartworm positive and had to go through treatment. She was negative for microfillaria and received a Proheart 12.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She does not like her mouth bothered so she was given her meds via canned puppy food.\u00a0\u00a0I tried to get her DNA from her mouth and lost her trust for a few days and she didn\u2019t want to be held by me.\u00a0\u00a0She loves soft food but will also eat kibbles.\u00a0\u00a0She has a hefty appetite and has gained a couple of pounds.\u00a0\u00a0She has been in a foster home with 5 other dogs for 3 months. She particularly likes playing with a much bigger 8 month old cur pup and they play tug-a-war, wrestle, and chase toys. She seems much more comfortable with men but will be a lap baby with the female foster and slowly trusting. She loves belly and chest rubs in your lap. She will be best in a home with no kids or older dog savvy teens. \n\nAdoption fees details:\u00a0\nPuppies - Adults $ 550, Seniors $375. These adoption rates include transport from Alexandria, Louisiana to designated New England adopter pick up locations and NE foster homes using either Rescue Road Trips, Pets LLC or CAFA Transport. If you do a search you will see that this is a very reasonable adoption fee and comparable to other rescues.\u00a0Adoption\u00a0fee breakdown:Adoption Fee: \u00a0 $ \u00a0365.00Transportation Fee: \u00a0$ 185.00MA and NH only--Quarantine fee if applicable: \u00a0$125.00\n\nMedical details:\nAll our dogs are altered (spayed or neutered), DHLPP, rabies, Bordetella, Heartworm tested with negative test results, microchipped, treated for parasites and on monthly heartworm and flea and tick prevention. A health certificate is issued by a licensed Louisiana veterinarian.\n\nAdoption details:  \nIn some instances, a meet and greet is not possible before adoption unless we have a foster home in New England available. Available for a Meeting confirms the dog is in a NE Foster home and available for a meeting in the city state provided. \u00a0Most times our dogs get adopted before a foster home becomes available - and if so, they go straight to adopters home. Foster parents talk to adopters and feel confident that this will be a match before our dogs are transported up. Also if by some chance it is not a match we have a safety net in place as we ask that adopters to let us know that it is not a match and we direct you to take the dog to a foster home or boarding kennel once that is arranged. If necessary, we will ask you to foster the dog until a foster home can be arranged.\u00a0\nTransport details:Rescue Road Trips (rescueroadtrips.com), Pets LLC (petsllc.net) or CAFA Transport will deliver our precious pups on commercial rescue animal transport to designated locations. \u00a0The fee is 185.00 which IS INCLUDED in your adoption fee already.**Rescue Road Trips, was featured on The Today Show - view it at http://www.today.com/video/today/55034556#55034556\n\nMA and NH RESIDENTS:\nIf you are a Massachusetts or New Hampshire residence, an additional fee of $125.00 will apply due to State quarantine fee requirements. If the dog is in a foster home in MA or NH, this fee will be added in the adoption fee regardless of where the adopters home is located making the total adoption fee $675.00 for puppies and adults $500.00 for Seniors, otherwise the full adoption fee for all other states is $550.00 for puppies and adults and $375.00 for seniors. This includes a 48 quarantine, recheck by a MA licensed veterinarian, and issued a MA health certificate.\n\nVisit all our available dogs at www.cenlaallianceforanimals.comWe update and add dogs frequently.\n\nWe hope to help make a difference in a rescue dogs life into loving responsible homes.",

She was surrendered to our rescue after her owner died. Reba has lived with other dogs, but like most Saint Bernards, she loves her personal space and really would love to be the queen of her own castle. She is excellent with children who are old enough that they will not get knocked down. Reba believes she is a lap dog, and once she is comfortable with you she wants nothing more than lots or cuddles. She is potty trained, crate trained, and working on basic commands. No kitty friends for Reba! \n\n\n\nReba is approximately 3 years old. She is spayed, vaccinated, microchipped, heartworm tested, has had recent bloodwork, and is current on flea and heartworm prevention. Rebas adoption fee is $425.

            "description": "One year old Clarice is from southern IL and she is happy to be up here in hopes of finding her forever home! In the meantime, she is having a ball in her foster home! Her foster mom had never even had a dog before, so when she signed up to foster and ended up with Clarice, we hoped it would be a good match! Her foster mom has done so great with her and loves this girl so much. She calls her Lola though. \nShe took the time to tell us alllll about Clarice, the good and the quirks:\n\"Lola loves toys (especially squeaky ones) and balls. She also enjoys playing tug-of-war, running, and going for long walks (hold on tight because she can really pull when chasing bunnies and squirrels)! Lola is very curious and stops to smell everything. Playing in the snow is also favorite pastime of hers. Lola loves people and always wants to be where the action is. Body massages are her favorite and she loves sprawling out on everyone's bed. Lola is very motivated by treats, praise and attention. She also prefers toilet water to water in her water dish, so keep the lid down. Lola likes to jump up on people to say hello, but we try to discourage that. \nLola doesn't like being alone and she hasn't been alone yet in our home. She is slowly getting used to the crate, but still in the dislike category. She will settle down in the crate after 10-30 minutes, though. Lola is housebroken if kept on a schedule. \nOn walks, Lola will pull but her harness is helpful! She must still be getting used to the non-rural environment because is fascinated by moving vehicles and will often bark at trucks. She will bark at other dogs on a walk sometimes, but we think that she really wants to say hi and play. She is still just a pup. I am trying to teach her how to heel, which she is beginning to learn as long as there are not other distractions.\nLola loves toys so much. Toys are the most fun if she has someone to play with. Balls, tugging toys, squeaking toys, frozen kongs, etc. \nOverall, Lola is a great dog. She is very smart and enjoys pleasing people. She responds well to treats and attention. She loves to snuggle up with us. Lola is very curious and will stop to smell everything. Since she is so strong, you'll need to hold on tight when she sees or smells a bunny. Mealtime is her favorite time of day. She is quite lovable and keeps us laughing.\"\n\nLola can be jumpy and slightly mouthy in a puppy way, so we would feel most comfortable with adults or a family with older kids. A strong handler for walks and someone with an aptitude and desire to seek training for their new dog would also be ideal! We hope to hear from you soon!",

            "description": "#698702Age: 2yrs Weight:48lbs How this pet arrived:This pet was transferred in from another shelter on October 8th. Why this pet is the one for you:Polly has had a tough go at life so far, but she has held out hope that her special person is out there. Polly came to us with a large group of other dogs from a shelter being hit by hurricane Delta. After Polly arrived we discovered that she was heart worm positive. Don't worry too much, we have started her vigorous treatment and she is on the road to recovery. Her adopters will have to be willing to bring her back for her next few treatments and be able to restrict her activity until she has a clean bill of health. Polly can be picky about her canine companions and get a bit on edge, so matching her with a compatible friend may take time. Polly is a sweet girl looking for someone who can give her lots of love and TLC. If you're interested in this girl, make an appointment today to bring this girl home!

            "description": "Miss Figgy is a 9 year old Female Boxer Shepherd mix. She was surrendered to a local shelter two days before Christmas because her family was moving.\nShe is happy, vibrant, and has a medium energy level.\nShe loves dogs of all ages, and sizes. She is cat friendly as well.\nShe is completely housebroken and loves her crate. Older children may be best as she is a larger girl of 75 pounds.\nShe is quiet on a leash. She does not react to other animals, or people.  She is protective of her people, and her yard. She will bark to alert strangers of her presence.\nShe is a big cuddle bug. Above all else this girl loves to eat.  \nUnfortunately Figgy was not spayed at a younger age, probably had multiple litters of puppies in her life, and had breast tumors that were surgically removed when she was spayed under our care.\nThe tissue was sent off for possible pathology and it was determined to be adenocarcinoma. The margins indicated that this cancer had spread beyond the initial mass in her breast. The tumors have been removed but there is a chance they may come back. Therefore we are looking for a loving home to give her the best life possible and shower her with tons of love. We are unsure what amount of life she has left, could be shortened, could be longer. Figgy is fostered in Hickory and can\u2019t wait to meet you and fall in love.",

I promise that I wont put the calories on you since I'm a playful little guy even though I look like a deer in the headlights in the picture. I promise I will only deliver a super size bundle of love. So drive in here to get me!\nHere is what the staff has to say about me:Max is very social and cute. The boy was picked up from being dumped in the country! Poor guy is very sweet and didn't deserve treatment like this. Max is around 72 pounds and 3/4 years old. So come down to see this sunshine boy today!\nPlease call Faustina at 806-664-1615 since she can give you details about the animals! If you call the Pampa animal shelter please refer to the animals by their number listed after the names. Thank you for you cooperation!",

Her family rescued her about 3 years ago and they live in Evergreen.\n\nShe loves her humans and is very playful, energetic, and super smart, so she learns tricks very quickly. She also loves to snuggle and play with her toys (she is particularly fond of playing tuggie).\n\nUnfortunately, Willow does not get along with other dogs or cats in the home and needs to be an only dog. She is also an anxious dog, so she will need lots of love and patience.\n\nIt breaks her family's heart to have to rehome Willow as she is a part of their family, and they want to make sure they find her a loving home where she can thrive. Willow is spayed and weighs about 45 pounds. Her shots are up to date.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Willow, fill out an application on the SummitDogRescue.org website. We are helping Willow's family find her a forever home with no other dogs in the home.",

Look at her face, She has stars in her eyes, On this lovely Bella Notte. \n\nBella walks well on leash with occasional pulling. She is friendly with new people and submissive in meeting other dogs. She keeps her tail wagging. She is good with riding in a car, though she needs help getting in. Thankfully she is comfortable being lifted. Bella is thin and will definitely need to gain a few pounds. Bella needs a home without cats. \n\nBella Notte came to us from Hitchcock Road Animal Services after being surrendered by her owners.",

            "description": "Looks like: Poodle\nMale, 11 years old, 12 pounds\nGeorgie is a handsome boy. He is a friendly little guy and is content finding a soft place to sleep and relax. He likes getting cookies, doesn't mind being held and is friendly with other dogs. He is very vocal and his future person will have to be accepting of this. He will become talkative at new things, people and noises. He's just sounding an alert, as he responds in a friendly way to new things. He is not a good apartment dog as he does not want to be alone in the house or in the car and will let it be know by barking incessantly, and even howling at times. Someone willing to help him with this separation anxiety and willing to spend more time than not with him, is ideal. \n\nWhile on leash, he walks very quickly, pulls a little, but responds decently. He mostly wants brisk walks but will occasionally stop short and cuts across one's path. He will also stop and look at any dogs that come near but he prefers not to engage. With new people, he is a little distant, willing to meet adults and allows a sniff of the hand and a brief pet. While home, he likes to explore the house and yard but does not have interest in playing. Georgie is not crazy about car travel, although he jumps in as if it's a natural thing to do. Then whimpers or whines a little. Sometimes he quiets down, and curls into his car bed. \n\nSince Georgie is deaf, it is necessary to communicate with him visually. He seems to be quick to learn the territory--the doors, the furniture. He is very self-consoling and does not beg for attention. Georgie needs a quiet home with one or two adults, might be fine with other small dogs since he previously lived with two others. \n\nGeorgie's guardian's home tragically burned down in the recent fires in Santa Cruz. His senior guardian decided moving into an assisted living facility would be her next step so she had somewhere to live, and unfortunately couldn't take Georgie with her. He was adopted from POMDR and unfortunately it did not work out due to an intense bladder stone complicating his health. This has been treated but he is susceptible to urinary crystals and will need future monitoring and care. He also has a heart murmur and will be on heart medication for life.",

Viv would love to be adopted by an active person who will exercise her. Viv was never properly socialized with other dogs, so our training staff is working on that.

Baxter has some anxiety and the unpredictable behavior of young children are just too much for him. He is looking for a quieter home where he can relax and enjoy the company of a loving adult or two. He would do well with respectful teens. He is currently on medication for his anxiety, but his owner thinks he could likely be weaned off once in a quieter environment. \n\nBaxter is a loving, somewhat goofy fellow who doesn\u2019t require a lot of exercise to be content. A short daily walk would be plenty. He does pull a bit on leash, so his person needs to be able to handle that. He has a little arthritis in his hips and is on a supplement for that. \n\nBaxter would ideally like a fenced yard as he tends to follow his nose and may wander where it leads him! Baxter loves car rides. He is also totally housetrained with never an accident in the home. \n\nBaxter will be happiest being an only dog. He loves his people, but is not really looking for a canine companion.  He\u2019s had no experience living with cats or other small animals. \n\nBaxter has intermittent skin issues which can lead to ear infections, so diet is important to keep those issues at bay. He does quite well on his Wellness kibble formula. \n\nIf you see a forever friend in Baxter\u2019s soulful eyes, please do submit an adoption survey here for consideration. \n\nhttps://www.olddogsnewdigs.com/adoption-survey/\n\n",

He likes cuddling under blankets while you are gone and hasn\u2019t chewed anything he wasn\u2019t supposed to. He is mostly housetrained but does need someone to remind him to go out every couple of hours until he gets in a routine. \n\nCasper barks at any outside noises even from under the covers in bed with us at night. He is not great on leash because he is shy of new people/experiences, but we think he would enjoy learning to be more of an on-the-go dog. He tolerates our other foster dogs, big and small, but he doesn\u2019t really like them and growls if they come too close to his cuddle buddy. He has lived with cats peacefully in the past. He is looking for a home without children under 15 as they scare him. \n\n",

We believe that he has been an inside-outside dog who roamed the farm during the day and slept inside at night; he was great with the farm animals.  \n\nA sweet boy once he feels comfortable, he can be shy when first meeting you and prefers to sniff you and say hello to you first before being picked up and held.  He feels this way about other dogs, too!\n\n*Black with a whiter face (photo is from when he was a bit younger :))\n*Small boy - about 8 - 10 pounds (a bit skinny but getting a little bigger!)\n*9 years\n*Loves to be with his family and people\n*Gains confidence the more he knows you and his surroundings\n*Lives with three other dogs currently\n*Healthy, neutered, and up-to-date on shots\n\n",

Puppy behaviors became less amusing to them as I became an adult but I didn\u2019t know what I was even doing wrong. Ironically I know all the commands, sit, down, come. I just get excited.\n\nSo now I need a family that will give me love and show me what behaviors they want from me. Positive reinforcement works best with me. I\u2019m a petite girl, my mom was a pure bred staffy bull and I weigh under 50 pounds. I love people and do well with other dogs but will only be placed as an opposite sex placement.\n\nIf you are looking for a beautiful, spirited, happy, smaller girl, I am the one! If you want to meet me please fill out the application. I am a cross post for another rescue , but everyone loves me so much they are helping!\n\n\nPepper will only be placed into a forever home that is located within 1.5 hours of Lake & McHenry Counties in Illinois...(sorry, NO exceptions).**\n\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our dogs, please fill out an application:at www.aandsrescue.com/AdoptionApplication100109.doc\n\nOnce your completed application is received, it will be reviewed, and then a volunteer will contact you.\n\n*We cannot do anything until we receive your completed application*\n",

He can sit, go down, leave it, and ring a bell to go outside. He loves to play fetch and chase teenage boys around the house. He\u2019ll thrive and delight in a family situation with some training to deal with his teenage moodiness around other dogs. He\u2019s a total sweetheart adored by his foster family who would love to keep him but are moving from a house with a yard to a condo.\n\nMike is best in a home with no dogs, even though he has made dog friends, he can get grumpy and not want to play. German Shepherds are really smart and being he is young, he has so much potential. Mike is a doll, but will need continuing training and someone who has experience with this breed.\n\nWe don't know how he is with cats and prefer a home without to be safe. :) \n\n** WANT MORE INFO OR THINKING OF ADOPTING THIS PET? **\n\nFor a QUICK RESPONSE go to -- WWW.HOPALONG.ORG -- and complete an adoption application. It is not a commitment to adopt, it just begins the process and shows interest in a particular animal. Someone will contact you by phone or email within 2 full business days to interview you or inform you on the status of your application.",

He has a silly personality and is always looking to put a smile on his family's face. He LOVES his fursibiling SO much!! He can run and play all day with them! He absolutely loves the attention and feeling love from his humans. He loves his people so much, that when you leave he will get VERY sad. He is a smart, but stubborn pup. He knows sit, paw and other paw. He has excellent recall skills, just needs someone to continue working training with him. \n\nBlaze is the pawwwwwfect dog for someone who works from home even after COVID. He likes to be with people at all times. Because of the constant changes in his short life, he suffers from SEVERE anxiety, With this being said, he will need a professional crate when and if you were to leave to run errands. Every time you step out of the home, he thinks you are never coming back so he will go through all obstacles to get back in your arms.\n\nBlaze's ideal home would be:\n-An ACTIVE family\n-A FENCED in yard (A MUST!!)\n-A home with another dog!!!!\n-Someone who is willing to train\n-A home where someone is ALWAYS home\n\nIf you believe BLAZE could be your fuuurever buddy, please fill out an adoption application: https://form.jotform.com/93263081961156\n\nIF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS PLEASE EMAIL INFO@MERCYFULLPROJECTS.ORG",

Patience, consistency, and lots of tasty treats are key! She is very active and would love going for long hikes and then settling down for a good snuggle afterwards. If you have room in your heart and home for sweet Maddy, please follow the steps below to submit an application. \n\n\n\n***In order to protect the health of our staff, volunteers and members of the public during the COVID-19 pandemic, we've made changes to our adoption process.\n1.

            "description": "Charlee, 4 year old terrier blend, 45lbs. Up to date on vaccinations and microchipped. 3 legs. \n\nHere is her story. In 2017 Charlee came to Paws Humane with a severely broken leg. Our vet determined that it was too severe to repair so we amputated. She recovered really well and was adopted shortly after. The person who adopted her wanted to return her for puppy like behaviors but never showed up to do so. Recently she was surrendered to another shelter by her owner who had found her wandering 2 years ago and kept her.  My guess is that her adopter just let her go some where instead of doing the right thing. Then the woman who kept dumped her at the shelter when she also didn't want anything more to do with her. She is sweet and we can not find a reason why no one wants this girl. We know that she lived with a child and cat in her previous home but she does not seem to do well with other dogs.\n\n1. This rescue is run out of a private home please do not email asking to meet the dog unless you have an application submitted or you have an application that has been approved 6months or less\n2.  The information that we have is current and to the best of our knowledge when we learn more about the dog's personality we immediately post that.\n3.   All of our dogs are good with school-age children. And will do fine with that as long as your child is good and respects dogs boundaries\n4. Please visit our Facebook page. Pictures and updates are posted there first.  \n\n5. All of our rescue dogs have the following\n\nSpay or neuter certificates\n\nvaccination records including Rabies\n\nAre on a monthly flea and heartworm preventive. \n\nCrate leash and house trained. \n\nGet along with other dogs ( otherwise indicated )\n\nEnjoy the company of school-age children who are respectful to them \n\nMost of them enjoy the company of cats as well, HOWEVER, in the past, we have found out that for some reason that is not always the case.  \n\nWe work VERY hard making sure our dogs acclimate to their new homes.  We seek adopters whose current pets are current on vaccinations and are altered. {\n\nPLEASE do not fill out an application if your pets are not. You will be denied.\n\n\nApplications can be found by going to our website  www.laurashoperescue.com\n\n",

            "description": "Maynard is a very sweet, loving boy who enjoys all people and dogs he meets. He is great with kids - playful but gentle and enjoys following them around the house. He does great in the crate overnight and has quickly figured out house training. He\u2019s beginning to master some simple commands like sit, down, and wait. (The latter is challenging for him!)\n\nHe enjoys time outside, but he\u2019s still learning how to walk on a leash. He requires some patience on his walk as he explores the sights and smells and will refuse to move if you push him too quickly. Each day, he\u2019s willing to walk a bit farther and faster with more confidence so this may resolve with regular walks, consistency, and comfort.\n\nHe enjoys chewing so giving him ample things to chew would be advised. He\u2019s a medium energy dog - he can be playful but mellows out fairly quickly for a dog his age. He doesn't bother our chickens which may bode well for any feline families! \n\n** WANT MORE INFO OR THINKING OF ADOPTING THIS PET? **\n\nFor a QUICK RESPONSE go to -- WWW.HOPALONG.ORG -- and complete an adoption application. It is not a commitment to adopt, it just begins the process and shows interest in a particular animal. Someone will contact you by phone or email within 2 full business days to interview you or inform you on the status of your application.",

My energy level gets me into hot water sometimes though, so I'll need a human who will give me structure and boundaries, and who can handle my strength. Experience with a headstrong dog is definitely going to be an asset with me in the house. I'm also an attention hog, I don't like other animals, and will need to be in a single-animal house. Okay okay before you close my page, I have so many wonderful qualities you need to hear about too! I am a ton of fun! I love to play, I love to cuddle, I am a through and through goofball who will give you smiles and stories. I have a long list of quirks, but a LOT of love to give. If you're looking for a dog FULL of personality, that's me ! If you're interested in me, please call the shelter to learn more about me!",

Sissy is your girl!\n\nSissy is a 13 year old Chihuahua who came to Fuzzy Pawz Rescue after her owner passed away. As she came into her foster home she was a bit shy and just wanted to curl up on anyone\u2019s lap for comfort. Since then she has won the hearts over many! \n\nShe is such a sweet girl who only wants you to love her and let her snuggle on your lap. In return she will shower you with kisses. She likes to take short walks and loves to go on car rides together but prefers to sit nicely on your lap. She loves to be your shadow as you go about the house and even in the yard. You see, Sissy was a lucky girl who was not only loved by her previous owner as well as her foster family but she has always had a person at home. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t mind you being gone for a few hours but she does have some separation anxiety because she loves being with people. At night, not only does she insist on sleeping with you, but will bury herself under your covers and snore away. Sissy does well with other dogs her size as long as they are calm and not in her face. The same said about cats. She of course wouldn\u2019t mind being the only dog either so she doesn\u2019t have to share your attention. Sissy loves the attention from everyone but would do best in a quieter home. If there are kids in the home, they must be 15 or older.\n\nBeing that she is a senior, she has some lumps that are just fatty tissue that older dogs usually get. She had a full senior physical at the vet and as she is in good health overall, there are a few things that need to be watched. The vets suspect she has the starts of cataracts in her right eye. As of now she doesn\u2019t seem to have any issues with it. She also has a weakened trachea. With this, we just don\u2019t want to do anything to cause her to cough a lot. For example, don\u2019t spray fragrance in the air if she is in the same room, don\u2019t use the powders on your carpets before you vacuum and don\u2019t take her for a walk where the dirt and dust can affect her nasal passage. And if you take her for a walk she will need to be in a harness rather than the leash attached to her collar. A smoke free home is a must for. She also recently had her dental done so her teeth are nice and clean! \n\nSissy is a special girl who deserves to live out her golden years in a home where she is pampered and loves to the fullest!  \n\n\n",

            "description": "Hi, I'm Lyla! My best physical characteristics are my ears, face markings, and my front legs that dance when I'm excited! My foster mom loves how I dance and prance on my front legs when I'm happy. I also love to come onto the couch and rub my face on your face before I start playing with my foster brother and sister. I also will kiss you right in your mouth!\n\nI hear I wasn't very well taken care of before I came to my foster home, but it doesn't reflect on how I interact with my foster family - I love my 8-year-old foster brother and 7-year-old foster sister - they play with me so much and it's pretty much the best thing ever!\n\nI am potty and kennel trained! I reluctantly sleep in a kennel at night, but I have a really comfy bed in my kennel that I curl up into. I know drop it, sit, go get it, no, leave it, go potty, go outside, play and sooooo many other things! I have not taken any training courses yet, but I am pretty well trained, as I am a wise gal. Love from my humans and treats are all the motivation I need. I am pretty calm most of the time but I get really excited when I'm playing with toys with my humans, I love to play. A squeaky ball is my favorite, tug-of-war with a rope is fun - basically any toy is my favorite!\n\nI didn't live with children before until I got to my foster home but Lexi (7) and Jaiden (8) have shown me that kids are so amazing to play with - I follow Jaiden around a lot to play and I love to snuggle Lexi on the couch. I have not met a cat or small animals. I would probably be super curious at first, but I'm pretty gentle and when I'm told no, I listen. I live with two other dogs - Simba (a Volpino) and Belle (a Chihuahua/Dachshund). They are much smaller than me, I try really hard to play with them, but they are a little scared of me. I would just love to roll around with them! I understand that when another dog says \"no\" I need to stop.\n\nMy foster mom tells me that even though I was not well taken care of, I am one of the best dogs she has had. I love everyone around me, I interact with new dogs well, I walk pretty, I play nice, and I was kennel trained within a couple days. My foster mom tells me she loves me a lot so that's awesome!\n\nIn my forever, I would really love to have another dog that plays gently and knows when to stop. Kids would be a really nice plus because I love children so much. My dream day would consist of playing, snuggling, going outside, repeat. Would love to meet you! 2/2/21 3:35 PM",

Great with children. \n\nShe has lived with other dogs but tended to pick fights with them, so we believe she prefers to be the only dog.\n\n1. This rescue is run out of a private home please do not email asking to meet the dog unless you have an application submitted or you have an application that has been approved 6months or less\n2.  The information that we have is current and to the best of our knowledge when we learn more about the dog's personality we immediately post that.\n3.   All of our dogs are good with school-age children. And will do fine with that as long as your child is good and respects dogs boundaries\n4. Please visit our Facebook page. Pictures and updates are posted there first.  \n\n5. All of our rescue dogs have the following\n\nSpay or neuter certificates\n\nvaccination records including Rabies\n\nAre on a monthly flea and heartworm preventive. \n\nCrate leash and house trained. \n\nGet along with other dogs ( otherwise indicated )\n\nEnjoy the company of school-age children who are respectful to them \n\nMost of them enjoy the company of cats as well, HOWEVER, in the past, we have found out that for some reason that is not always the case.  \n\nWe work VERY hard making sure our dogs acclimate to their new homes.

All he wants is love and cuddles from his favorite people! Bear is just the biggest love bug, the second he see's you his butt is already wiggling and his little tail is wagging! Bear loves laying out in the sun and going for a nice little walk. He is a bit overweight and will need help from his new parents to shed a few pounds! Since Bear is a big boy and he does like to jump up, we believe he would do better in a home with older kids. We don't know if Bear has ever been around cats or other dogs, so if there are any other dogs in the home we will require a meet and greet just make sure everyone gets along well! Bear has done great with the potty routine here, but may need a second to adjust to the routine in his new home. Bear is neutered, current on his vaccination, heartworm negative, and microchipped so he is ready to go home with you today! Come meet this sweetie pie at the Waggin' Tails Adoption Center in Benbrook, open every day from 12-6 pm, by appointment!\n\n*Please give us a call at 817-249-3647 to schedule an appointment for this pawsome guy!",

            "description": "Columbus OH- Dexter came to us for respite care with the goal of returning back home.  Sadly, he lost his \"Mom\" yesterday and will be in need of a new home in the Central Ohio area.  Occasional visits with the nurse who has cared for him and his Mom over the years will be a requirement to adopt.  He is a 4 year old Pekingese/Cavalier mix, likely in the 20-25# range (he needs to lose a bit of weight).  He will be fully vetted and groomed prior to adoption.  He is the sweetest guy, he loves attention!  He loves being brushed and he will play fetch until you drop.  He is not a loud dog and is very well behaved and housebroken.  Dexter has shown possessiveness issues of toys and people when around other pets and therefore will only be placed in a pet-free, child-free home.   If interested, please fill out an adoption application at https://hospets.org/hospets-adoption-application/\n\nNOTE:  Dexter will only be adopted in the Central Ohio area\n              Dexter has dry eye and will require daily eye drops\n              Dexter has a mild heart murmur and will need to be checked yearly\n              If interested in the Dexter the first step is filling out an adoption application\n",

She has beautiful blue eyes and loves the outdoors.\n\nTEMPERAMENT: Oreo loves other dogs and loves being outside. She does have some food aggressions that will need to be worked on. She walks vey well on leash but is not a big fan of the slip lead or a lot of touching around her head and neck. Oreo travels very well in the car and has good recall if there aren't too many distractions. She loves to sit quietly in the window and watch cars, people and dogs walk by. Oreo has been working on learning to trust people and is doing very well with it. She will seek out affection but is still nervous of the response she will receive from her person. \n\n\nIDEAL HOME: Oreo is best suited for an active household, one where she can spend plenty of time exploring the outdoors, she would be an amazing hiking partner. Oreo is a pack dog and she would thrive in a home with another dog. She also would like someone that is patient and will help her rebuild her trust in people. \n\nIf you would like to meet Oreo, please fill in an adoption application.\n\nPlease note: We apologize for being unable to respond to inquiries about our dogs without an adoption application.\n",

Jane is high energy so this gal would need plenty of playtime and exercise. She pulls on a leash but with some basic obedience training, this could easily be resolved. Jane is food motivated. She knows the sit command. Jane is afraid of cats in a shelter atmosphere. Dogs are generally tested with dogs of their own size; and dog meets with the resident dogs are always encouraged. MEET-AND-GREET REQUIRED Dogs are generally tested with dogs of their own size; and dog meets with the resident dogs are always encouraged. Our cat test should be used as a general purpose screening only to rule out overt aggression; we always recommend caution when introducing dogs to cats in the home. Recommendation on suitability of placement with children by their ages is based on behavioral observations including energy level and response to body handling. We never recommend leaving young children unsupervised with dogs, and we cannot guarantee the behavior of dogs with children, other pets or cats. Behavior evaluations should be considered as a snapshot of the behavior of the dog at this point in time; JHS believes all dog families need to be prepared to invest time and energy into training as well as provide common sense management of their new dog. We always encourage family to do some research on the breeds or mixes of breeds prior to adoption as many can have some unique characteristics that may or may not fit into their families. Always remember that the majority of dogs at our shelter have been exposed to or may have kennel cough. Kennel cough is contagious to other dogs, please talk to your vet if you have any questions about kennel cough prior to adoption. Please ask your adoption counselor at time of adoption if you have any unanswered questions regarding illnesses and treatments of the path that you are adopting. For more information about this dog or any others at our Shelter, please visit www.joplinhumane.org. We are the Joplin Humane Society in Joplin, Missouri. 417-623-3642",

            "description": "MEET MAKO!!\n\nUnderdog Rescue does not physically have this dog in its possession. She is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4506680.\n\nMako is such a sweet girl that has been at the shelter for a long time and she needs to go home soon!! She's been there over 60 days but that doesn't get her down. She loves when volunteers come to her kennel to take her for a walk. She walks easily on the leash but she does zig zag back and forth when walking and she loves people so much that she likes to walk close to the walker's legs. She's so happy that she wags her tail the entire walk. She likes to go in the play yard and will play fetch with the ball for a little while but the thing that Mako wants to the most is to show you how much she loves you and get some affection in return. She knows how to \"sit\" for treats and will take the food gently. Mako can get a little excited when she's happy and will jump up but she is easily corrected and will sit down when told to. She's a smart girl and can be trained not to jump if she's rewarded with a treat. She would do better in a home with children that are 5 years and older.\n\nMako didn't like the other dogs when she was taken into a play group and would do best as an only dog. If you think Mako would make a good fit in your home, please come and meet her today! She would love to go home.\n\nIf you are interested in saving this pet, please reach out via this link: https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/foster/BPAZ/Dog\n\nTo actually visit with this pup, please make an appointment here: https://mcaccappointments.as.me/adopt. NOTE: People who sign up for these appointments often no-show, and we have seen that you can generally show up and let them know you are there to meet this particular dog and the shelter will squeeze you in, except from 12-3PM or closer to the 6PM closing time. (Please know this is not a guarantee). If the dog is at risk, please ask for a supervisor to meet that particular dog.\n\n*Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG. MCACC is located at 2500 S. 27th Avenue, Phoenix. Different adoption fees/policy may apply. Please visit MCACC's website http://www.maricopa.gov/pets/locations.aspx for hours. You may also wish to call 602-506-7387 (PETS) and provide the animal's A# above to verify is still available.",

This rescue is run out of a private home please do not email asking to meet the dog unless you have an application submitted or you have an application that has been approved 6months or less\n2.  The information that we have is current and to the best of our knowledge when we learn more about the dog's personality we immediately post that.\n3.   All of our dogs are good with school-age children. And will do fine with that as long as your child is good and respects dogs boundaries\n4. Please visit our Facebook page. Pictures and updates are posted there first.  \n\n5. All of our rescue dogs have the following\n\nSpay or neuter certificates\n\nvaccination records including Rabies\n\nAre on a monthly flea and heartworm preventive. \n\nCrate leash and house trained. \n\nGet along with other dogs ( otherwise indicated )\n\nEnjoy the company of school-age children who are respectful to them \n\nMost of them enjoy the company of cats as well, HOWEVER, in the past, we have found out that for some reason that is not always the case.  \n\nWe work VERY hard making sure our dogs acclimate to their new homes.  We seek adopters whose current pets are current on vaccinations and are altered. {\n\nPLEASE do not fill out an application if your pets are not. You will be denied.\n\n\nApplications can be found by going to our website  www.laurashoperescue.com\n\n",

She is shy with people but really opens up when there is another dog for her to play with. She would do best in a home with older children and another playful dog.  GOOD with cats \n\nApplication is the first step!!!!!\n\n\n\n1. This rescue is run out of a private home please do not email asking to meet the dog unless you have an application submitted or you have an application that has been approved 6months or less\n2.  The information that we have is current and to the best of our knowledge when we learn more about the dog's personality we immediately post that.\n3.   All of our dogs are good with school-age children. And will do fine with that as long as your child is good and respects dogs boundaries\n4. Please visit our Facebook page. Pictures and updates are posted there first.  \n\n5. All of our rescue dogs have the following\n\nSpay or neuter certificates\n\nvaccination records including Rabies\n\nAre on a monthly flea and heartworm preventive. \n\nCrate leash and house trained. \n\nGet along with other dogs ( otherwise indicated )\n\nEnjoy the company of school-age children who are respectful to them \n\nMost of them enjoy the company of cats as well, HOWEVER, in the past, we have found out that for some reason that is not always the case.  \n\nWe work VERY hard making sure our dogs acclimate to their new homes.  We seek adopters whose current pets are current on vaccinations and are altered. {\n\nPLEASE do not fill out an application if your pets are not. You will be denied.\n\n\nApplications can be found by going to our website  www.laurashoperescue.com\n\n",

            "description": "Sending shelter says this boy is  amazing \n\nThis is Mr. Chuck Norris. He is about 1.5 years old and 52 pounds. He is a charmer. He was found limping in the middle of the road and heartworm positive. We recently treated him for the heartworms and took him for x-rays. X-rays show that he has a previous injury that has since healed. Appears to be caused by possibly being hit by car and his L front elbow could have been fractured and then healed on his own. Per our vet, she believes that he will more than likely have arthritis in his joints. He does not seem painful, nor does he have issues walking so amputation is not needed. Adopters should know that he will more than likely have a limp for the rest of his life. it is more of a trot.\n\n\n\n1. This rescue is run out of a private home please do not email asking to meet the dog unless you have an application submitted or you have an application that has been approved 6months or less\n2.  The information that we have is current and to the best of our knowledge when we learn more about the dog's personality we immediately post that.\n3.   All of our dogs are good with school-age children. And will do fine with that as long as your child is good and respects dogs boundaries\n4. Please visit our Facebook page. Pictures and updates are posted there first.  \n\n5. All of our rescue dogs have the following\n\nSpay or neuter certificates\n\nvaccination records including Rabies\n\nAre on a monthly flea and heartworm preventive. \n\nCrate leash and house trained. \n\nGet along with other dogs ( otherwise indicated )\n\nEnjoy the company of school-age children who are respectful to them \n\nMost of them enjoy the company of cats as well, HOWEVER, in the past, we have found out that for some reason that is not always the case.  \n\nWe work VERY hard making sure our dogs acclimate to their new homes.  We seek adopters whose current pets are current on vaccinations and are altered. {\n\nPLEASE do not fill out an application if your pets are not. You will be denied.\n\n\nApplications can be found by going to our website  www.laurashoperescue.com\n\n",

Zera is interested in cats and could be friends with one, though she might bite in self defence.

PLEASE READ ENTIRE BIO & FAQs BEFORE EMAILING THE RESCUE****\n\nTeeny and Taz are a bonded pair of female dappled chiweenies. They were with their previous owner since 6 weeks old. They are now 7  years old. Their owner took very good care of them and was moving to a place he could not take them. They are spayed and heartworm negative. They are fully housetrained and go to the door when they need to use the restroom. They have the most fun loving and affectionate personalities. They love to play with each other and then sleep on each other. They are very clingy with people and want to follow their people around everywhere. They are eager to be on a lap, and if you stop petting them, they will paw at you to beg for more pets. They are not stranger weary and are outgoing with new friends. They weigh under 10 pounds. \n\nTo apply to adopt this dog, visit www.snarrnortheast.org/applications and submit an application. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING \n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder,  there are sometimes discrepancies between the breed that is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $375 for adults. Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n\n\n",

True to his border collie and herding nature he is best suited for an owner with the time and energy to keep him active and mentally stimulated. \n\nPERSONALITY: Alpha is smart, affectionate and energetic. He will spend hours playing fetch and knows some tricks and basic commands like sit and shake paw. When his is not adequately stimulated he will chew up toys but knows that his bed is not for chewing. He can be dog selective so should always have proper introductions when meeting a new doggie friend. He is a bit jumpy and would likely not be suited for small children that he may knock over in excitement. \n\nIDEAL HOME: Alpha is searching for an active home, one with a fenced yard for him to run and play is best. He is not suited for condo or apartment living. He would love a home that would be interested in agility training as it would satisfy his needs for mental stimulation.\n\nIf you would like to meet Alpha, please fill in an adoption application.\n\nPlease note: We apologize for being unable to respond to inquiries about our dogs without an adoption application. Please visit www.almosthomeyyc.com to fill out an application.\n",

There has been some improvement in Pinky, she has a cherry eye that will be fixed.  Corky seems much older and grumpier.  But his favorite treat helps a lot.  He is being treated for his skin condition.  He actually has already showed he kind of likes people.  They just need some time to adjust and find a family that will show them what having a forever family is like. My adoption fee is $125 which includes my spay/neuter, age appropriate vaccinations,  heartworm disease test,  microchip/registration fee and collar .  ADOPT ME TODAY and find a friend for life!   And remember that adopting a pet is a life long commitment.",

There has been some improvement in Pinky, she has a cherry eye that will be fixed.  Corky seems much older and grumpier.  Pinky and Bixby are about 3 years old.  But his favorite treat helps a lot.  They just need some time to adjust and find a family that will show them what having a forever family is likeMy adoption fee is $125 which includes my spay/neuter, age appropriate vaccinations,  heartworm disease test,  microchip/registration fee and collar .

            "description": "01-24-21 UPDATE: Colt is a really sweet boy who just wants to love you. Treeing walker coonhound Colt is a really sweet boy. He has the best eye contact. He will look at you with his honey brown eyes and you will be in heaven! He really just wants to love you. He could probably be an emotional support dog if he had a patient and diligent trainer. He could never be a dog that goes to hospitals and is a therapy dog because he's too active, but he really connects with humans. He also absolutely loves to run around the backyard with another dog or multiple dogs; it would help him a lot to be adopted to a home with another dog. He would do great with kids because he's really playful. We don't recommend him with young kids because he's big and we don't want them to get knocked down inadvertently. Technically he is a medium-sized dog at 52 pounds, but he has long legs. Thus, Colt is a very fitting name for him. He does gallop about -- he is absolutely beautiful. An adopter returned this dog after 15 minutes because they thought he was too wild in their car. If he were in a crate he wouldn't have been. He also will bay in the right circumstances, so he definitely wouldn't be the right choice for someone who lives in an apartment or lives really close to somebody else. But, he would be absolutely fantastic in a household where there are other hounds so they could just be themselves and be absolutely adorable. To adopt teenaged treeing walker coonhound Colt, please visit our website  www.peace4paws.org and fill out an adoption application. Thank you.  =======================================================   \nColt is a super sweet young Treeing walker coonhound mix who appeared at a KY shelter just before Christmas as a stray. No one claimed him so he spent all of Christmas and New Year\u2019s in the shelter. He just can\u2019t wait to get out and start his new life with his forever family!!! Colt is fifty-two pounds, approximately one year old, and good with dogs. He loves to play with other dogs. By all appearances he seems like he will be a great family dog. We don\u2019t have too much info about whether he needs training in housebreaking or not. We don\u2019t have any specific info on how he is with kids or cats at this time. If more info comes in before he arrives January 10th, we will post it on our Facebook page as soon as we know. We do know that he will be up to date on all his shots, neutered, and microchipped by the time he arrives here. To adopt this handsome hound boy please visit our website www.peace4paws.org and fill out an adoption application. Thank you so much! \n\n\nDog Size Guidelines:\nSmall: 25 lbs and under (11 kg)\nMedium: 26\u201360 lbs (12 \u2013 27 kg)\nLarge: 61\u2013100 lbs (28 \u2013 45 kg)\nExtra Large: 101 lbs or more (46 kg)",

            "description": "MEET SHADOW!!\n\nUnderdog Rescue does not physically have this dog in its possession. He is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4114075.\n\nLook at Shadow's smiling face! He's still smiling even though this is his second time at the shelter looking for his furever home and now he's been there for more than 60 days. It should get him down but it doesn't and he's still a happy boy. Shadow loves to go for a walk especially if you walk at a fast pace. Like to walk slower? Then just put a harness on Shadow and he walks at a calm, easy pace. When he went on a day foster trip, the volunteer stated he jumped right in the car and loved to go for a ride. He got a cheeseburger for lunch and ate it gently. On his way back to the shelter, he laid down in the front seat and put his head in the volunteer's lap and licked her hand to thank her for her kindness and his awesome day.\n\nThe kind people that found Shadow wandering in their neighborhood said he was potty trained and he knows \"sit\" for treats. It would be so great if Shadow could find his furever home soon. If you think Shadow would be a good fit in your home, please bring the family and come and meet him today. He would probably do better if he was the only dog in the home, but if you already have a dog, please bring them with you to see if they would do well together.\n\nIf you are interested in saving this pet, please reach out via this link: https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/foster/BPAZ/Dog\n\nTo actually visit with this pup, please make an appointment here: https://mcaccappointments.as.me/adopt. NOTE: People who sign up for these appointments often no-show, and we have seen that you can generally show up and let them know you are there to meet this particular dog and the shelter will squeeze you in, except from 12-3PM or closer to the 6PM closing time. (Please know this is not a guarantee). If the dog is at risk, please ask for a supervisor to meet that particular dog.\n\n*Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG. MCACC is located at 2500 S. 27th Avenue, Phoenix. Different adoption fees/policy may apply. Please visit MCACC's website http://www.maricopa.gov/pets/locations.aspx for hours. You may also wish to call 602-506-7387 (PETS) and provide the animal's A# above to verify is still available.",

This 4-year old wiggle butt emits magical fibers of love and, like her name, is one fergilicious little lady. And little she is! Fergie is short in stature at 34 compact pounds, but more than makes up for it in her sassy and larger-than-life personality. She is the CEO and founding member of the IBPC (Ittie Bittie Pittie Committee), frozen in time as a perpetual pint-sized puppy. But it's obvious from her condition that someone didn't take very good care of her. She has large scars on her back, leg, and face, possibly from an old burn injury. She was picked up with a raging UTI and her now-shiny coat had likely been urine soaked for quite some time. She has been working on housetraining in her foster home - likely a combination of the UTI and the possibility she was confined and/or not let outside regularly. But this short stack holds no grudges and looooves everyone she meets. And we've promised her it's all unicorns, cupcakes, and sprinkles from this point forward.\n\nFergie is a miniature munchkin, a sophisticated ewok, and an enchanting mogwai rolled into one. Her stunt doubles literally include Gizmo and Baby Yoda (with the sound effects to match). She's a pro at chirping like a baby bird and is happily inquisitive in her foster home, trotting along to explore every nook and cranny. In fact, you'll likely catch The Dutchess snorting up a storm, canoodling with her favorite humans, or snoozing with her petite pink tongue peeking out from her adorable under bite. So delicious! She loves human companionship and would thrive in a home where she is treated as one of the gangon the couch watching the game, snuggled up in bed for quality cuddle time, and going on adventures with her favorite humans.\n\nFergie loves to eat and will gobble up and guzzle down virtually anything you put in front of her (except zucchini - that's gross!). Fergie is relaxed around the dogs in her foster home, though she's much more interested in humans and food, and says no thanks to kitties. We suspect she would enjoy being the center of attention. Due to his lack of history, older kids would be best for this loveable lowrider.www.pittieloverescue.org\n\nPlease consider a donation so that we may continue the important work we do.",

The woman that brought them in said she believed their previous owners had moved out and just left them behind. I have been told that they are both just as friendly as can be. They need some serious TLC and cuddle time and I am looking for foster to adopt homes for each. Potential candidates must have a fenced in yard and be in the Chicago area. They have had no vetting and will see my vet upon arrival for exams, vaccinations and blood work. They will need work on cage and house training. Please call Lisa@ 630-694-1359 for foster to adopt information.",

ARL has no idea what their story is.  Bixby is the more friendly one, a little more trusting of humans than Pinky and Corky.  There has been some improvement in Pinky, she has a cherry eye that will be fixed. Bixby and Pinky are about 3 years old.   Corky seems much older and grumpier.  But his favorite treat helps a lot.  They just need some time to adjust and find a family that will show them what having a forever family is like.   My adoption fee is $125 which includes my spay/neuter, age appropriate vaccinations,  heartworm disease test,  microchip/registration fee and collar .  ADOPT ME TODAY and find a friend for life!

            "description": "Oreo is a tiny male Papillon that was surrendered to our shelter after his owner passed away.  He\u2019s a cute little fella, and easily fits in your lap at only fourteen pounds.  He has big butterfly ears and a soft fluffy white and black coat.  Oreo really misses his Papa and would love to be in a home again.  He prefers a quiet calm household with someone that is home most of the day.  Oreo is perfect for a senior or family with older children.  He is very affectionate and will form a close bond with you.  Always a gentleman, he is well behaved and calm.  Oreo is housebroken and will need a fenced in yard.  Other than a daily walk, he doesn\u2019t require much exercise.  Oreo spends most of his day blissfully snoozing; content in the knowledge you are near.  He would be perfectly happy as your \u201cone and only\u201d pet but does do well with other calm mature dogs.  If you currently own a dog, we can schedule a meet and greet to check if they are compatible.  Oreo has not been around cats but we can test that for you.  This little dog is really quite special and needs to feel loved again.  If you are looking for a sweet calm companion, Oreo is the perfect dog for you.  \n\nTo adopt this pet, Click \"More About Us\" and then \"Adoption Application\" to be directed to our online HSNWGA application form.  You will be contacted by our Adoption Coordinator once your application is reviewed and approved.  Due to high volume of applications, we are only able to contact those applicants that best meet the needs of that individual pet.",

She has recently been returned to us with her younger fur brother Jax OS after their owner abandoned them with roommates. She is a sweet girl who gets along with people and other dogs.\n\nWe are really hoping to see Jax and Lady adopted together, since they have obviously grown up together. They are very well behaved and friendly, if a little timid at first. We don't think they have every lived with very young children, so that might be a no go, but they'd love an active family to play with!\n\nIf you're interested in Lady Muriel, go to EHRDOGS.ORG and submit an application.

            "description": "Unkie is an approximately 12 week old collie mix pup that currently weighs 18 pounds.  He is one of three pups in the litter. Unkie is the largest, a boy, with floppy ears. How very wonderful these three are at being puppies!!  They have the rotation of cuddle, play, eat and sleep down pat.  They are into exactly everything a puppy should want to be into...they know all the ways to get out of the trouble they get into....they clean their bowls....they steal everyone's favorite toys,  but they give them back politely when asked.  They are some type of Collie mix, is my best guess.  They will be large dogs, but not giant dogs and they will all have at least slightly fluffy coats. Unkie is the most independent, in a good way.  He can occupy himself with toys and doesn't have to be in the middle of the circus all the time. Unkie will make a great companion!!!\n\nUnkie is up to date on shots and preventatives and is microchipped.  He will be adopted with a neuter agreement due to his size and age.  Unkie's adoption fee is $250 plus any additional donation you feel appropriate.  Our adoption fee is set to a level to make adoptions happen.  They do not cover our costs. Thank you for your generosity and interest in our dogs!   \n\nAll dogs adopted locally through SGDR receive a free six-week session of obedience classes and a lifetime of behavior support through our Project REWARD program with trainer Charlotte Blake.\n\nYou must have an approved application before being able to visit a dog. Visit our website below for an adoption application https://www.snootygiggles.com/dog-application/\n\nIf you expect to leave the dog alone for long periods of time, please do not consider adopting a puppy.  Puppies need lots of attention and companionship.  Thanks.\n\nAll known information about the animal is listed above. We do our best to give accurate information, but most of our dogs are rescues and do not come with a known history.",

            "description": "My life before Peak Lab Rescue was a struggle to say the least. I was on my own and starving for a while. I was caught by animal control and spent a WHOLE MONTH at the shelter. I'm not gonna lie, things were looking pretty bleak for me. Fortunately, I caught the eye of a volunteer from Peak. Next thing I knew, I was in a car on my way to freedom.\n\nMy name is FlapJack, but foster family has lots of nicknames for me: Jackjack, Blackjack, Jaxson, Jackie, Handsome, and my personal favorite - \"Goodboy. I am around 2 years old and 55 pounds of lanky houndy goofiness. Like a couple of the people in my foster home, I am a gorgeous redhead. I have adored every person I have met and will thump my tail in appreciation whenever I am spoken too. I truly know how lucky I am and am such a happy boy!\n\n \nThings you should know about me:\n\n ~I am fully recovered from my neuter, microchipped, and up to date with vetting.\n\n~I talk in my sleep. Foster dad LOVES my sounds and likes to play me like the bagpipes sometimes, too.\n\n~I am housebroken. I had one accident due to a new medication, but even with an upset tummy I have made it outside every other time.\n\n~I am crate trained.\n\n~I walk great on a leash.\n\n~I love my foster sibling dogs. Even the grumpy one. I would prefer a home with a friendly big dog like me or some doggy friends I can play with regularly.\n\n~I am very food and affection motivated. I learn quickly when treats or love are involved.\n\n~I love ice cubes. I come running when I hear the ice dispenser.\n\n~I like chicken. Maybe a little too much. I was on my own for a good while and helped myself to someone's yard birds. A guy's gotta eat, right?! I haven't met any cats in my foster home, but they may be too interesting for me. I definitely need a home without chickens.\n\n~I have not been around kids in my foster home. I am probably a bit too clumsy and mouthy to be in a home with small children, but would love to have some dog savvy older kids.\n\n~I love a good dog bed. I have been allowed on the couch by, but generally prefer the dog bed or floor for sleeping at night.\n\n~I enjoy being near my people, but I am not what they call a Velcro dog once I have settled in. I don't mind a little space between us. I do love to cuddle once we get to know each other.\n\n~I love a soft squeaky crinkly toy, but I have to be watched closely with them. I made one \"disappear once.\n\n~Although I'm a mostly good boy, I do have a bit of a naughty streak. I need a family with a little bit of a sense of humor to handle things like me stealing a sock or unrolling toilet paper.\n\nI was positive for heartworm when I came to Peak Lab. I have completed treatment and my activity restriction is done. I will just need routine preventatives and follow up.  I should be able to have a normal long healthy active life. I am a moderate energy guy who also knows how to enjoy a long nap. I would love a family that will take me hiking and on adventures and keep training me to be the perfect dog for them. Are you my family? If so, fill out an application right away. Foster mom says I'll be scooped up quickly!",

As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals or how large puppies will be when fully grown.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our 'Visit' page for hours and directions to our shelter. We look forward to seeing you soon!\n\nLink to the Adoption Application: \nhttps://www.animalhouseshelter.com/adopt/adoption-application/\n\nAnimal House Shelter\n13005 Ernesti Road\nHuntley, IL 60142\n\n847-961-5541 phone\n847-961-5537 fax\n\nOpen:\n\nSunday-Friday from 11 AM to 7 PM\nSaturday from 9 AM to 7 PM\n\nConnect With Us:\n\nLike Us On Facebook\u00a0!\nWatch Us On YouTube\u00a0!\nFollow Us On Twitter\u00a0!\n\nAdoption Application:\u00a0https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/adopt/adoption-application/\n\nAdopt a Pet:\u00a0https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/adopt/\n\nDirections to Shelter:\u00a0https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/visit/\n\nAdoptable Dogs:\u00a0https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/dogs/\n\nAdoptable Cats:\u00a0https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/cats/\n",

Is your room too quiet at night and need to hear snoring to fall asleep? Well then do we have the dog for you! Blue is the sweetest dog ever who loves love! We are not sure of his age, but we believe he is on the older side. He is also one of the LAZIEST dogs I have ever met. He will get bursts of energy where he wants to play but for the most part, he Is happy chilling on the couch or his bed. Even though he is lazy he loves to go for walks, and he will do a happy dance, or his tail will go into helicopter mode when he realizes it\u2019s time for a walk. Blue is a typical male who likes to push his boundaries to see what he can get away with and will need a firm voice in the beginning until he learns who is in charge. Blue is blind in one eye but that doesn\u2019t stop him from catching the majority of food that you throw at him (as long as it\u2019s a good toss).\n\nOur organization only adopts within the United States.\n\nFaith and Hope is a multi-state rescue with locations in Texas, Washington and Oregon. All dogs are rescued from the state of Texas to and transported to our Washington and Oregon locations with placement in their adoptive families. Our $425 adoption fee includes all core vaccinations (DHPP, rabies, spay/neuter, microchip)\n\nIf interested in learning more, please email us at faithandhopeadoptions@gmail.com or fill out our online application.\n\nhttps://www.faithandhopefoundation.org/adoptionapp\n\nIf interested in learning more about our adoptable dogs and adoption process, or our foster home program, please contact us at above email.\n\nDue to the number of requests that we receive on our puppies and dogs, please be advised that all adoption applications are processed in the order received. Once we send you an application, your place in line does not get reserved until your application is returned to us.\n\n",

Is your room too quiet at night and need to hear snoring to fall asleep? Well then do we have the dog for you! Blue is the sweetest dog ever who loves love! We are not sure of his age, but we believe he is on the older side. He is also one of the LAZIEST dogs I have ever met. He will get bursts of energy where he wants to play but for the most part, he Is happy chilling on the couch or his bed. Even though he is lazy he loves to go for walks, and he will do a happy dance, or his tail will go into helicopter mode when he realizes it\u2019s time for a walk. Blue is a typical male who likes to push his boundaries to see what he can get away with and will need a firm voice in the beginning until he learns who is in charge. Blue is blind in one eye but that doesn\u2019t stop him from catching the majority of food that you throw at him (as long as it\u2019s a good toss).\n\nOur organization only adopts within the United States.\n\nFaith and Hope is a multi-state rescue with locations in Texas, Washington and Oregon. All dogs are rescued from the state of Texas to and transported to our Washington and Oregon locations with placement in their adoptive families. Our $425 adoption fee includes all core vaccinations (DHPP, rabies, spay/neuter, microchip)\n\nIf interested in learning more, please email us at faithandhopeadoptions@gmail.com or fill out our online application.\n\nhttps://www.faithandhopefoundation.org/adoptionapp\n\nIf interested in learning more about our adoptable dogs and adoption process, or our foster home program, please contact us at above email.\n\nDue to the number of requests that we receive on our puppies and dogs, please be advised that all adoption applications are processed in the order received. Once we send you an application, your place in line does not get reserved until your application is returned to us.\n\n",

He is currently located at Maricopa County Animal Care & Control, Animal ID Number A4465702.\n\nBuster is a big, beautiful boy that has been at the shelter for way too long now. He's been there for more than 60 days and he wants to go home soon. All of the volunteers that have taken Buster for a walk have all stated he is such a pleasure to walk. He walks easily on the leash and just loves to smell and take in all of his surroundings. He checks in often to make sure everything is okay. He will \"sit\" on command for a treat and takes them gently. Buster loves treats! He's also non-reactive to all of the barking dogs in their kennels when he gets out for a walk. He enjoys going to the play yard and will play with toys for a while but what he really loves is if you sit on a chair so he can put his head in your lap and get petted. He will also roll over so he can get some pets on his belly too.\n\nBuster can be more timid around men but he did well in a home with a 14 year old and the shelter recommends he go to a home with older children. He did get overwhelmed when taken to the play yard with other dogs so he might do well with a companion that is calm and laid back like he is. If you think Buster could be a good fit in your home, please come and meet him today! Please bring any dogs you may already have at home to meet him to make sure it will be a good fit.\n\nIf you are interested in saving this pet, please reach out via this link: https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/foster/BPAZ/Dog\n\nTo actually visit with this pup, please make an appointment here: https://mcaccappointments.as.me/adopt. NOTE: People who sign up for these appointments often no-show, and we have seen that you can generally show up and let them know you are there to meet this particular dog and the shelter will squeeze you in, except from 12-3PM or closer to the 6PM closing time. (Please know this is not a guarantee). If the dog is at risk, please ask for a supervisor to meet that particular dog.\n\n*Please Note: This animal is courtesy posted for the Maricopa County Shelter; UNDERDOG RESCUE DOES NOT HAVE THIS DOG. MCACC is located at 2500 S. 27th Avenue, Phoenix. Different adoption fees/policy may apply. Please visit MCACC's website http://www.maricopa.gov/pets/locations.aspx for hours. You may also wish to call 602-506-7387 (PETS) and provide the animal's A# above to verify is still available.",

I went straight into foster care and have adjusted myself quite well. Don\u2019t let my age fool you; I\u2019m a spry guy! I can jump up and down onto the couch, go up and down the stairs, and even get up onto the headrest of couches with ease! I\u2019m a fun guy and enjoy hanging beside you and observing.\n\nYou can still come adopt me or even join our foster program to help the humans learn all the awesome things about new dogs like me! Learn more on our website! \n\nHope to see you soon! \n\nWhat breed am I? Mixed mutt! ODHS does not breed label (unless there\u2019s official paperwork), as studies show it is nearly impossible to tell the exact breed of each dog based off of their appearance.\n\nEducational article:\n3/3/3 Rule:\nhttps://www.rescuedogs101.com/bringing-new-dog-home-3-3-3-rule/?fbclid=IwAR2iv5m7fqk3FieO7LOsstGeGsYYV_F1rJOd1BPxaImofLpcinpYsUbFRWs\n\nAdoption Donations are $250 for an adult, $350 for puppies (a dog under one year of age), and $125 for a senior dog (based on the age of the dog). Adoption donations are to be made via cash, and credit/debit card. There is a $5 fee to run cards.\n\nPlease remember to bring a collar and leash (non-retractable) with you the day of the adoption. Note: Martingale collars and slip leads are strongly recommended.\n\nDue to COVID19, we aren't having as many open, public adoption events.  Current schedule is pre-determined meet and greet appointments are Wednesday evenings and on Saturdays. \nOur adoption center is located at 3602 Lafayette Blvd, Suite 102, Fredericksburg, VA 22408. It's important that you keep an eye on your emails for any changes or updates during the adoption process.\n\nVisit our website for an application to adopt. \nhttps://www.olddominionhumanesociety.org/adoption-application\n\nOld Dominion Humane Society is a volunteer based organization. We are run completely by volunteers, who also have full time jobs, so we appreciate your patience.  Currently, the average timeframe for a response to your application is 1 week.\n\nLike us on Facebook \"Old Dominion Humane Society\"\nand be a part of promoting forever homes for dogs in need.\n#Adopt #Donate #Foster #Volunteer \n\nNote: ODHS only adopts to Virginia and surrounding states (including D.C.). A $50 out of state fee applies.",

Unfortunatley we do not know anything about archie's history from his previous owners, but we did discover that he loves to jump up and give hugs and kisses. He is super affectionate and loves attention. He loves meaty treats, and knows some basic commands. He is playful and energectic, so he will do good in a home with someone who will help him burn off some energy. If you are intrested in meeting him, please call the shelter to make an appointment.\n\nThe Henrico Police Animal Shelter will be accessible by appointment only until further notice. Animals available for adoption can be viewed online at petfinder.com or adoptapet.com. Please contact the Shelter at (804) 727-8807, Monday-Saturday, 10 a.m.- 4:30 p.m. to schedule an appointment for adoption. Thank you.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Please contact EF for more information about this pet.Thanks for your interest in a pet from A.R.F.! If you see a pet here, they are still available for adoption and you should apply through our adoption application on our website at https://www.arf-il.org/adopt/application/\nCookie is a 5 year old female Shepherd Mix who weighs in at 40 pounds. She is good with other dogs, however, will do best if fed separately as she likes to keep the food to herself. Her foster thinks she would do ok with cats too, but does not have any cats in the home. Cookie is a very nice girl! Her foster describes her as laid back, friendly, and calm. She can, however, be a little clumsy and given her strength, she may do better with children age 8 and up.\n\nCookie is micro-chipped, up to date on all vaccinations, housebroken and spayed. Her new family will be required to complete a basic obedience course of their choosing.\n\nCookie's adoption fee is $300. A meeting will not be scheduled until you have an approved application, so if you're interested in adopting Cookie fill out an Online Application today!\n\nOnce your application has been approved, an ARF volunteer will contact you to arrange a meeting.\n\nThank you for considering a rescue pet from A.R.F.-Animal Rescue Foundation! We are\nbased in Wheaton, IL and conduct adoption events in the DuPage County area. If you are interested in adopting one of our pets, please submit an adoption application at https://www.arf-il.org/adopt/application/\n\nAdoption appointments are scheduled based on the order of applications received, so submit your application early! Submitting an application does not commit you to any animal but does get you a head start with the adoption approval process. Due to a high volume of applications, we are often unable to respond to questions or schedule meetings until your application has been approved. More information about our adoption process can be found on our website here: https://www.arf-il.org/adopt/\n\nAs an all-volunteer, foster home-based organization, A.R.F. Animal Rescue Foundation does not have a facility where applicants can visit our animals. Please visit https://www.arf-il.org/events/ for a list of our upcoming adoption events.\n\nThank you for choosing to adopt, not shop!",

He does still have some puppy chewing tendencies but he also knows some basic commands already and he loves to play! Loki still needs some leash training as he tends to pull when he goes for walks.

Barry seems to be a fairly mellow dog that would love to find a home with plenty of love that he can stay in forever. Barry used to get away from his previous family fairly often, so he would do best with a fenced in yard or always being leash walked. Barry is a very sweet boy that loves to explore, go for walks, and make new friends. In the right home we know that Barry can really blossom and show off his full personality!

She loves to go for walks, and is learning not to pull. She knows the sit command and is working on stay. She would flourish with a little training. Ella loves puppies and she\u2019s great with my older dogs and loves to play. She\u2019s a great dog. She loves to have belly rubbed. Ella thinks she is a lap dog. She loves to be picked up and held. She is house trained, and kennel trained. Ella eats in her kennel. She stays in her kennel when I leave the house because I have too many to leave unsupervised. She gets in her kennel around 7pm with a treat then lights out. She gets up and goes straight outside between 6:30-7:00am. No kennel accidents. She\u2019s really a wonderful pup. Very sweet and loving. She likes to lay beside you and get some love while you watch tv. She never meets a stranger and loves kids. She\u2019s a beautiful, sweet pup and she will make a great addition to any family.\n\nOur organization only adopts within the United States.\n\nFaith and Hope is a multi-state rescue with locations in Texas, Washington and Oregon. All dogs are rescued from the state of Texas to and transported to our Washington and Oregon locations with placement in their adoptive families. Our $375 adoption fee includes all core vaccinations (DHPP, rabies, spay/neuter, microchip)\n\nIf interested in learning more, please email us at faithandhopeadoptions@gmail.com or fill out our online application.\n\nhttps://www.faithandhopefoundation.org/adoptionapp\n\nIf interested in learning more about our adoptable dogs and adoption process, or our foster home program, please contact us at above email.\n\nDue to the number of requests that we receive on our puppies and dogs, please be advised that all adoption applications are processed in the order received. Once we send you an application, your place in line does not get reserved until your application is returned to us.\n",

I went straight into a foster home and have done well so far. I\u2019m a bit nervous at first, but enjoy laying on the couch. Don\u2019t let my age fool you, I can leap over piles of snow and go up and down stairs.\n\nYou can still come adopt me or even join our foster program to help the humans learn all the awesome things about new dogs like me! Learn more on our website! \n\nHope to see you soon! \n\nWhat breed am I? Mixed mutt! ODHS does not breed label (unless there\u2019s official paperwork), as studies show it is nearly impossible to tell the exact breed of each dog based off of their appearance.\n\nEducational article:\n3/3/3 Rule:\nhttps://www.rescuedogs101.com/bringing-new-dog-home-3-3-3-rule/?fbclid=IwAR2iv5m7fqk3FieO7LOsstGeGsYYV_F1rJOd1BPxaImofLpcinpYsUbFRWs\n\nAdoption Donations are $250 for an adult, $350 for puppies (a dog under one year of age), and $125 for a senior dog (based on the age of the dog). Adoption donations are to be made via cash, and credit/debit card. There is a $5 fee to run cards.\n\nPlease remember to bring a collar and leash (non-retractable) with you the day of the adoption. Note: Martingale collars and slip leads are strongly recommended.\n\nDue to COVID19, we aren't having as many open, public adoption events.  Current schedule is pre-determined meet and greet appointments are Wednesday evenings and on Saturdays. \nOur adoption center is located at 3602 Lafayette Blvd, Suite 102, Fredericksburg, VA 22408. It's important that you keep an eye on your emails for any changes or updates during the adoption process.\n\nVisit our website for an application to adopt. \nhttps://www.olddominionhumanesociety.org/adoption-application\n\nOld Dominion Humane Society is a volunteer based organization. We are run completely by volunteers, who also have full time jobs, so we appreciate your patience.  Currently, the average timeframe for a response to your application is 1 week.\n\nLike us on Facebook \"Old Dominion Humane Society\"\nand be a part of promoting forever homes for dogs in need.\n#Adopt #Donate #Foster #Volunteer \n\nNote: ODHS only adopts to Virginia and surrounding states (including D.C.). A $50 out of state fee applies.",

These girls have been thru thick and thin together but we have decided they will do best in separate homes, they love each other but rely too heavily on each other.  They are both very loving and super affectionate.  They walk like angels on a leash and are up for all of the adventures life has to offer.  We would love to adopt them separately but in close proximity so allow for play dates with each other.   \n\nKit is currently finishing up heartworm treatment (covered by the rescue) and is spayed and up to date on her vaccines.\n\nApply to adopt this cuddle bug today! She is so looking forward to calling your home her furever after.\n\nwww.LuckyDogRefuge.com\n\nREAD THE FOLLOWING FOR INSTRUCTIONS ON SUBMITTING AN APPLICATION FOR THIS PET:\n\n- The first step towards adoption is to complete an adoption application, which can be found online at our website www.LuckyDogRefuge.com, under the \u201cApply Now\u201d tab\n\nor\n\nat https://forms.gle/LXKMKSnagxLSad668.\n\n- Do NOT use the Petfinder links or email to ask us about our adoptable dog listings - we do not always receive these messages and will not respond to them.\n\n- Please do not ask if a dog is still available - we do our best to update their status as quickly as possible. If a dog is listed for adoption, it means we have not yet approved an adopter and are still accepting applications.\n\n- PLEASE NOTE THAT ONLY APPROVED ADOPTERS WILL BE PERMITTED TO MEET OUR RESCUES.\n\nThanks for considering a rescue pup!",

She loves to go for walks, and is learning not to pull. She knows the sit command and is working on stay. She would flourish with a little training. Ella loves puppies and she\u2019s great with my older dogs and loves to play. She\u2019s a great dog. She loves to have belly rubbed. Ella thinks she is a lap dog. She loves to be picked up and held. She is house trained, and kennel trained. Ella eats in her kennel. She stays in her kennel when I leave the house because I have too many to leave unsupervised. She gets in her kennel around 7pm with a treat then lights out. She gets up and goes straight outside between 6:30-7:00am. No kennel accidents. She\u2019s really a wonderful pup. Very sweet and loving. She likes to lay beside you and get some love while you watch tv. She never meets a stranger and loves kids. She\u2019s a beautiful, sweet pup and she will make a great addition to any family.\n\nOur organization only adopts within the United States.\n\nFaith and Hope is a multi-state rescue with locations in Texas, Washington and Oregon. All dogs are rescued from the state of Texas to and transported to our Washington and Oregon locations with placement in their adoptive families. Our $375 adoption fee includes all core vaccinations (DHPP, rabies, spay/neuter, microchip)\n\nIf interested in learning more, please email us at faithandhopeadoptions@gmail.com or fill out our online application.\n\nhttps://www.faithandhopefoundation.org/adoptionapp\n\nIf interested in learning more about our adoptable dogs and adoption process, or our foster home program, please contact us at above email.\n\nDue to the number of requests that we receive on our puppies and dogs, please be advised that all adoption applications are processed in the order received. Once we send you an application, your place in line does not get reserved until your application is returned to us.\n",
