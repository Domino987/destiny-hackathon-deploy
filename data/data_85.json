WE are a high intake No Kill Shelter ran by a staff of 4 and do not always have time to answer every question asked by so many. If you are a good fit for the animal you are interested in -we will call to speak with you, If we feel you are not a good fit , we will contact you about other pets that may be a good fit for your home. Many people are losing the opportunity to adopt the animal they want because they fail to put in an application and the pet was adopted before we could answer your email. .If you have applied for an animal in our facility and have not received a response within 7 days, PLEASE call or contact us again. Though we do our best in trying to answer all emails in a timely manner, sometimes things get away from us, get lost or misplaced. It is never our intention to ignore a request about an adoptable animal in our facility.\n\nSandy Brown, Director, PAW Animal Shelter\n\n319-372-2274",

            "description": "12/30/20: Nyla had a meet and greet last night with a family with another dog. We have determined that Nyla would probably do best in a home with no other pets as she has a very dominant personality and wants to lord over other dogs. Although she has done well with the dogs here, we feel that Nyla would just be happier getting all of the attention and not have to feel as though she needs to compete with another dog. We would also recommend an experienced dog owner and someone who is willing to set firm boundaries for Nyla. She is very smart and highly trainable but she also needs to know that she doesnt make the rules. Nyla has a lot of energy and is a strong dog, both physically and by sheer will. She needs a stronger owner that she sees as a leader. An active person who can get Nyla out and about or someone who can give her a job would be an ideal home for her.10/28/20: Nyla is heartworm positive. She has been started on ivermectin monthly so she will just need to be kept on the ivermectin each month until a negative test is obtained.\nNyla is a beautiful shepherd/spitz mix. She is approx 1 1/2-2 years old and currently weighs 64 pounds (she could stand to put on some weight and fill out more). Nyla has had a rough start in her young life. Nyla's original owners had a domestic situation which resulted in Nyla being left alone in a crate for a couple of weeks. She had no access to food or water and nearly died. A lady took her in and saved her life, however she had livestock and cats, both of which Nyla is not good with. After Nyla nearly killed her senior mini pony, she decided Nyla needed a different home that was more suited to her. Nyla can not go to a home with cats due to her high prey instinct. She seems to do fine with other dogs but would probably be best with dogs her size or larger or as an only pet. Nyla loves people and children. She walks fairly well on a leash (does pull alittle at times) and would make a good running, walking, hiking companion. Nyla loves to ride and will jump right in the car, ready to go. She would love a trip to the beach or a fun social day at the dog park. Nyla wants to be with you and does not like to be confined (understandable given her past). A fenced yard or leash walking would be needed for her and she would do best in a more active home. This girl has had it rough and its time for her to find the love, attention and care that she deserves and so desperately craves. Nyla's adoption fee will be $175 to help cover her vetting and cost of care. If interested in giving Nyla her forever home, please submit an adoption application (located on our homepage on petfinder) and your interest via email, text ONLY to 352-215-3260 (phone calls will not be answered or returned at this number), or FB message us.",

We were notified he was looking for rescue on 10/20, and since we do evals on Fridays, we didn't get to meet him until 10/23. During evals, Randi was able to calm him down and handle him with no problems We need more time to network this boy and find a safe place for him! A few days later he was given a deadline and now he is a Beauties boy. We believe he deserves the time for us or anyone to get to know him. The volunteer that picked him up said he is energetic and sweet. Dirk is looking for a foster or forever home. We will update his profile as we get to know him better.",

He will stay, heel when walking, and wait for a command before he leaves his crate, goes outside, or eat that treat on the floor a couple of feet in front of him. He totally enjoys life and wants a new family who will enjoy it with him. He is great in the car and will walk right into the water, if you are into water sports.  \n\nWe think he would be great at dock diving. He is very athletic.  He needs a fenced yard with room to run.  Children running and playing with him would be a huge plus.  Max is the perfect family dog.  \n\nMax will sometimes bark at other dogs until he gets to know them.  He is working on that and doing very well.  Until November, he lived most of his life on a farm with little interaction with other dogs.  His world has dramatically changed since he left the farm and he is enjoying it.  He loves people of all ages, especially children.  He considers himself one of them, which he is.  \n\nMax is a healthy boy.  He is crate and leash trained.  He is up-to-date on vetting, neutered, and on heartworm prevention.  He is still growing and maturing.  He will probably end up around 65 lb.\n\nFor more information contact Judy at paxtonj@live.com or 865-300-8146. Adoption fee is $150.  Application online at www.almosthometn.org\n",

My coat is a lovely combination of black and brown and my personality is also a wonderful mix of some great qualities. Once we become friends, you'll get to see the softer side of me. I'm a very sweet and nice guy, I just need a bit of time when we first meet to get to know you. I'm a man who enjoys his routines in life. Maybe you do too? I also prefer the quiet and predictable surroundings of home over being out and about - what can I say, I'm a bit of a homebody. I'm not the overly needy type who begs for your constant attention, so if you need to head off to work, or run some errands, you won't need to worry about me impatiently waiting for you to return. Don't get me wrong, I'll be happy to see you, but a little bit of independence never hurt anyoneam I right? Do we sound like a good match? Wanna give it a shot?",

He has sweet eyes and wants to trust as he leans into you once he knows you're \"safe\". Won't you be his new best friend? \n\nObservations by volunteer S. Shaffer 10/20/20",

Despite the conditions in which I was found, I am an extremely friendly and gentle boy and just want to share my love with everyone. I like to play with my fellow canine friends, but can be selective sometimes. I've got a fair amount of energy and a relatively strong prey drive so I would probably do best in a family with older children and no cats or other small animals. I also love to jump up on my new friends. An experienced dog owner would love to have me around and I definitely need a big yard to run around in and expel some energy! I am also the type of pup who would love to go on active adventures with you and your family. I would benefit from continued training, as I am not quite potty-trained yet, but as long as you take me on lots of long, leashed walks, I'll be happy!",

As we have done many, many times, we treated her for the disease in the best manner possible. The treatment was long, sometimes painful, and she had to remain on activity restriction, which meant spending months in an indoor run.\n\nWe are very happy to say that Dolly is now free of heartworms, and ready for adoption! She is a playful and affectionate pup who would benefit most from a younger, active family.

He was never taken on a walk. He didn\u2019t pay much attention to people and when he did, he was pretty wary.\n\nWe worried that Samson might have given up on life \u2026 but you can\u2019t keep a good dog down!\n\nEvery day since his arrival at his foster home has been another step on Samson\u2019s journey to recovery. Every day, the medicines, supplements and good food have helped heal his body. The affection and constant company of his foster mom and dogs have gone a long way to heal his spirit.\n\nLife outdoors exposed to the elements has made Samson super-appreciative of his new life indoors. He loves the comfort of a dog bed and house \u201ctraining\u201d came natural to him \u2014 he has never had a lapse! Samson\u2019s started doing happy dog stuff like rolling around in the grass, chomping on his favorite toys and leaning in to his foster mom for head rubs.\n\nHe loves to chew; tree branches are a favorite outside, and indoors he channels the puppy in him by munching on Kongs and rubber toys, as well as hefty rope toys. He\u2019s never happier though than when he\u2019s quietly lying beside his foster mom, whatever she\u2019s doing.\n\nSamson loves other dogs but starts out a little over-excited with them. This usually passes quickly and he has become pals with his foster home\u2019s little dog.\n\nSamson sight and hearing are fine, and he only barks at stranger-danger. Since he does have arthritic hips, keeping his weight in check is important. At the moment he can climb stairs, though with some effort. Samson is receiving a number of medications and supplements that have greatly improved his mobility and comfort and he may well benefit from being on those for life. Short walks several times a day will also help keep Samson mobile, although he does love to stop and sniff as much as walk.\n\nSamson has blossomed so much in just a few months! All he needs is a kind owner to live his happiest life.\n\nIf you can\u2019t adopt Samson, but would like to support his ongoing care, please send donations to PGSPCA.org/donate and add a note that it\u2019s for Samson.\n\nPlease consult our ADOPTION FAQ (http://www.pgspca.org/adopt/frequently-asked-questions/)  before contacting us.  If you are viewing this listing on a site that is not Petfinder or Adoptapet, please check our main site: \nhttp://www.pgspca.org/adopt/adoptable-animals-2\nfor the most up-to-date information on this pet.\n\nIf you are interested in Samson, consider letting us know by filling out a (no-obligation) adoption application (http://www.pgspca.org/adopt/online-adoption-application/) and we will arrange a meeting.\nDue to his age and arthritis, Samson will not be attending adoption shows.\n\nNOTE: We are an all-volunteer group and do not operate a shelter. All of our animals are in foster homes. Due to our requirement for a home visit, we generally only place animals within an hour's drive of Washington, DC.

But don't let my age fool you, I'm a spunky boy with lots of love to give and will make a fun companion. Foster mom says that I'm sweet, silly, and social, and would thrive in a home where I can be close to my people and fur siblings. I'm a world class snuggler you should know. \nI'm completely house trained and crate trained and very willingly go to my crate, sometimes on my own! I enjoy freedom in the house (read: couch!) with supervision. I'm a curious, energetic guy who enjoys outdoor adventures and will keep you smiling and laughing everyday!\nLots of play and exercise help make me a good boy! I'm still learning important training basics, and would greatly benefit from continuing to work on my training with you. Positive reinforcement training with treats, did someone say treat?, is a great way to build my confidence and encourage me to do the right things, which I very, very much want to do! Oh, and I really love it when my foster mom kisses my face and tells me what a good boy I am! Maybe I'll find a new forever mom to do that too?! I really just need my people to give me guidance, direction, and structure.\n\nI love all people, even children, but they say I may be a bit nich for younger kiddos. I can join a home with other dogs too! I currently live with two confident cats in my foster home who can handle my exuberance, though some supervision is still required. I have a lot of life in me, and get along with dogs of all sizes, male and female, who are sweet with me. Since I'm so excitable, I may do better in a home with a dog who is a little more calm and relaxed, but mainly I just need an experienced dog owner, not a first time dog owner. I'm sensitive to the energy around me, so a relaxed environment and family will help me stay calm and happy! I sure hope your home is the perfect one for me!\n\nAlbert's Dog Lounge is a transporting dog rescue, meaning that we rescue many of our dogs from high kill shelters in areas of dog overpopulation. We are a specialty rescue focusing primarily on senior and special needs dogs.  The vast majority of our dogs come from the Houston, TX area where we have an entire team of volunteers, coordinators, and fosters. We do also work with local shelters, rescues, and owners.  If you apply for a dog that is currently in our local Houston program, we will work to get your dog transported to WI as quickly as possible. We ask that you have patience during this time of uncertainty and unprecedented dog adoptions nationwide. \n\nLearn more about Albert's Dog Lounge, our mission, and adoption policies by visiting Albertsdoglounge.org. \n\nOur process includes an approved application, reference checks, a homevisit, and then a meet and greet with the dog. Adoption fee is $275.\n\nBegin your application process by copying this link into your web browser: https://www.albertsdoglounge.org/apply\n\nWI Dept. Of Agriculture License Number: 474085-DS",

His favorite notes are the woodsy and floral smells wandering around the house or woods, or the fresh note of clean laundry or human musk that lets him know his people are around. After a long session of nose work, he will happily lay down to catch some rays and some zzzs in the sunshine.\n\nHuck has been diagnosed with Glaucoma in both eyes. His left eye is totally blind but still has sight in his right eye. To help his right eye, he is taking daily drops. Huck does not let this stop him and simply goes about his day with little concern to what is happening to his eyes, and greets each person and new experience with a goofy grin.\n\nHuck has done well with the additional spice of a canine friend in the home. He has not yet been around cats, so we are unsure of a feline pairing with him. While Huck hasn\u2019t yet been around children, his sweet and laid back nature makes his foster thinks the fruity, silly nature of children could be a good top note in his forever home.\n\nHuck is a sweet, easy-going pup looking for a family with a base note of love, a love note of kindness, and a top note of outdoor activity. Is your home the one to hit all the right notes for Huck?\n\n\n\nHis adoption fee includes spay/neuter, heartworm/Lyme test, all age-appropriate vaccinations (distemper, rabies, & Bordetella), HW and flea/tick preventative, and microchip implant and registration. \n\nThere is no guarantee of age and breed as a rescue animal's history is unknown. All ages and breeds are best guess.\n\nAdoption fees INCLUDE a mandatory sales tax of 7.525%.\n\nDue to post-adoption services provided, it is Pet Haven's policy to only place dogs into homes within a 75-mile radius of the Minneapolis, MN city center.\n\n",

Once she has had a stable, loving home she has thrived! Mama Blue is smart, gentle, and affectionate. At home, she loves to lounge around finding warm comfortable places to nap. Even better if a human is on the couch that she can snuggle with. Her calm demeanor along with her impeccable behavior make her an ideal dog to have around the house. Shes quiet, non-destructive, and accidents have been non-existent. Her current situation is just her and her foster but she spent a couple weeks in a home with other dogs, children, and a cat and she did great!\n\nHer favorite part of the day is walks and would walk all day if she could! She loves the park and is fascinated by squirrels. Mama Blue is always friendly and calm when approached by other dogs she can be a little passive but usually warms up quickly and loves these small opportunities to interact with other dogs. Shes also a people and dog watcher. One of her favorite pastimes is to sit on top of the hill in the park and watch all the dogs and people playing!\n\nMama Blue is a fantastic companion that would be a great option for anyone looking for the calmness of an adult but the energy and enthusiasm of a puppy. This is an easy-going girl that would do well in nearly any situation as long as she is given love and attention!\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

            "description": "Coming soon Phelps! Phelps is a handicapable excited pitty mix who suffered from swimmer syndrome as a puppy resulting in his front legs being fused in a 90 degree angle. We are currently working with a wheelchair builder to have some custom wheels made just for him so he can run and be happy. Once he gets his wheels and has built up enough muscle and aligned his spine better, we will be having custom prosthetics made for his front legs so he can be as free and happy as possible. Since he isn't quite ready to be adopted, but we are still looking for the right family for this guy. We are open to foster to adopt situations with the right home and someone who is willing to participate in his therapy and prosthetic process. Please fill out an application below if you are interested in this wonderful ham :).

            "description": "TRUE DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH!\n\n \n\nTater Tot is just one of those dogs that begs to ask, \"how did you get here?\" It is apparent that this sweet girl must have been loved at the start of her young life. She is outgoing and social, has the beginning foundation of some great basic skills and then it is like her world just stopped...enter YOU!\n\nTater Tot is a bit of a Heinz 57; Labrador Retirever/Shepherd type mix with a wide and bright smile. She is approximately 1.5 years of age, weighs 60lbs, is up-to-date on vaccinations, spayed, microchipped and heartworm negative.\n\n \n\nTater tot is a recent graduate of the board and train program. She is pretty great at sit kennel and lie down. Her trainer notes indicate that she knows sit pretty but we are refining that skill still. Tater tot is treat driven, extremely smart and willing to be taught new things. The opportunities are endless with this sweet pup!\n\n \n\nShe is generally very well behaved in the house (she does not realize her size) and appears to be house trained. Tater Tot is very affectionate and loves to give hugs and kisses! She likes to be near her human, but is enjoys exploring the back yard and does not exhibit any type of anxiety in exporing her surroundings on her own. This smart gal loves to play with toys! Tater Tot will sleep in her crate all night without a peep and does not present any issues when asked to do so. She can even be caught napping in the crate from time to time.\n\n \n\nTater Tot is inquisitive even though she likes to be a part of the action, she already understands simple commands like no and down. She is very alert and attentive, so we think she will be easy to train! She appears to enjoy car rides (she jumped right into the car when we picked her up and has been well-behaved on the outings she has taken so far.\n\nShe will have small (adorable) outbursts of energy during the day when she gets excited and playful (zoomies) and she will need work to curb her remaining puppy tendencies to mouth (but is easily corrected). She also loves tossing around and playing with stuffed animals! Her leash manners are a work in progress, but make no mistake that this smart gal already knows that the presence of a leash, means she gets to go on a walk (and she gets very excited about that)! She will make a fantastic hike/walking partner in no time! \n\nTater Tot will make an amazing family member! With some consistency and patience in her training, she will flourish as an amazing companion. She is so intelligent and eager to please. Her foster family has 3 kids (11-14) and she does extremely well with them. This girl has a great foundation and is looking for her forever home. Hopefully its you, you wont be sorry!\n\nPlease complete an application to meet Tater Tot today!\n\n*Homeownership Required!\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

            "description": "COLORADO BIO: \n\nMeet Heather! In the short time that we have had Heather, she has stolen our hearts. I can only imagine how loved she will be when she finds her forever home. Every foster family that has had the chance to meet Heather, has instantly fallen in love with her. Heather is slowly coming out of her shell as she soaks up all the love she can get from her foster humans. Now that her puppies have homes of their own, it is Heathers time to shine. Heather is kind, sweet, patient, and oh so gentle. She is amazing with people! Heather is sometimes a little slow to warm up, but she does excellent with a little patience and reassurance. \n\nHeathers favorite hobbies include car rides, long walks, cuddles, kisses, and anything to do with food. Heather loves cuddling up with a blanket in her kennel just as much as she loves cuddling up with her humans. She is very easy going! Heather does great in her kennel. She sleeps through the night in her kennel and she feels safe in her kennel when her humans are gone. On walks, she is easy on the leash, but she doesnt miss her shot at sniffing out a bunny.\n\nHeather loves people and dog watching. She doesnt bark and just likes to observe. Heather is a little slow to trust other dogs. She does best with slow introductions to other dogs. After Heather has the chance to get to know another dog, she does much better at existing with that dog. \n\nHeather is learning how to play. She hasnt found her favorite toy just yet, but she loves bones and treats! We dont know how well she knows her commands, but she goes with the flow and follows her humans lead. She is very easily redirected and is a great listener. Heather is quick to catch on and has good manners. But if you leave a hot, juicy steak on the counter, she might just snatch it! \n\nHeathers golden eyes are so sweet and inviting. Her markings are beautiful and unique. She smacks her lips at the sound of food, and you know she is happy when her tail thumps away. Heather was focused on being a mama to her pups, but now she is ready for her own adventure! \n\nTEXAS BIO:\n\nHEATHER'S TURN FOR A BEAUTIFUL LIFE...\n\nHeather's past is not known outside of the fact that she and her young puppies were dumped at the door of a high-kill shelter in Houston, TX by \"owners\" whom would not be bothered long enough to even provide shelter staff her name. Immediately separated from her babies, Heather was left alone, praying that someone would come along to save her. Enter 2BABR to bring Heather AND her puppies to Colorado in hopes that each and every one of them will now have a fresh new beginning at the start of what we hope will be a wonderful life!\n\nENTER YOU: This beautiful girl has the most unique markings, certainly spurring conversation during your many walks to meet new people and take new adventures. Heather is suspected to be a Dalmation/Cattle Dog Mix; she is approximately 2 years of age, weighs just under 50lbs, is up-to-date on vaccinations, spayed, microchipped and heartworm negative. Heather was a wonderful mother to her babies and has initially tested well with other dogs.\n\n*Homeownership Required!\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

Scooby is very obedient and knows all basic commands and some tricks! He is a quick learner and would love to be with an active owner who will spend time playing and exercising with him. He a chill pup and sleeps most of the day but needs daily walk/exercise and would do best in a home where he is not left alone for long periods of time. He bonds quickly with his people and would do best in a quiet home with no kids or cats. You'll have peace of mind having Scooby in your home. For strangers coming into the home, it takes a proper introduction for him to get comfortable. He loves other dogs and was most recently in a foster home with two other foster pups. He is very playful and plays well with humans and dogs and loves the dog park. Sometimes it takes a proper introduction for strangers coming into your home once he feels He is incredibly athletic and is a master at fetch!",

He was surrendered to Chicago Animal Control when his owner could no longer care for him due to a condition called perianal fistulas, common in German Shepherd Dogs. With a good diet and medication, Kovu\u2019s fistulas are well managed. He would benefit from a home where someone is home often to give him his daily meds. Kovu is currently fostered with a female GSD and lived previously with cats. Kovu especially likes to make friends with tiny dogs. As any typical GSD, Kovu gets attached to his humans. He loves to cuddle, walks well on leash, rides great in the car and has excellent house manners. Kovu is an all around fabulous boy that will make a lovely companion to a special home.\n\nIf interested in adopting Kovu, the first step is to complete an adoption application at www.gsrescue1.org \n\nPlease note we will not answer inquiries without an application on file and we only adopt local to Chicago.",

A good walker, she knows sit and stay and generally acts like a well mannered lady. Athletically built, engaging and responsive, she might make a good exercise buddy. She seems to enjoy activity but isn't one to party out of bounds. Iggy's adoption fee is $150. She's altered, current on shots, wormed, microchipped and treated with monthly heart worm, flea and tick preventive. How can you resist her fly away ear?",

            "description": "Have you met Pinky?\n\nLittle Pinky came to us from the Long Beach Shelter, where she was surrendered by her owners. She is approximately 13 years old and weighs 8 lbs. Pinky doesn't have teeth and enjoys soft food. Pinky is a sweet and quiet girl in our play yard, and she will jump into any available lap for pets.\n\nIt was a happy holiday season for Pinky! She got to go on TWO Flings - one for Thanksgiving and one for Christmas! This is very special because Pinky is in kidney failure so we really appreciate these families taking her to make her holidays shine! Here's what we've learned about her:\n\nPinky is a flirt and LOVES men and boys! Her very favorite person was her very own 10-year-old boy on her Thanksgiving Fling. She laid with him every chance she got and even got her crate moved to his room for bedtime so they could be close by. Pinky can be a picky eater but it was found that she really just prefers to graze over a period of time. She was fed in a separate room to give her space from the other family dog and would bark when she was finished and wanted to rejoin the family. Pinky lived with other small dogs in both of her Fling homes. She co-exists with other dogs just fine, but doesn't really interact with them. Because of her kidney issues, Pinky has to potty frequently. Both of her Flingers found that Pinky does seem to know to go potty outside and if you take her out when she gets up from her naps she will potty right away! One family tried potty pads at night and she seemed to know to use them as well.\n\nOne of her Flingers shared, \"This weather is a bit too chilly for Miss Pinky, but she has found her favorite spot on our couch and I wrapped her in a throw. She loves my 10 year old son and is always looking for him. She ate THREE huge meals yesterday and kept asking for more. She is a big fan of The Honest Kitchen dehydrated food. She loves her cozy round bed in her crate and happily \"makes her bed.\" She goes to bed at 7pm and easily sleeps 12 hours in her crate. She really just needs a calm home with a warm bed, a warm sweater, and your warm heart.\"\n\nPinky is currently living in a Foster home, but she would love a Forever Family.\n\nPinky is considered hospice. We will gladly cover her lifelong medical care and teach you how to care for a kidney dog if you have a little extra love to spare.

No adoption fees and we help with medical costs!\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\nUpdated 1/24/21 KG",

            "description": "Date of birth (est.) Oct. 23, 2015.\n\n\n\"Drax is a handsomely marked, athletic boy looking for his fur-ever home. He is very sweet, has a wonderfully smooth coat, and loves to be hugged, petted and told what a good boy his is. He rides well in the car, loves people and gets along well with other dogs. After his initial enthusiasm wears off, he walks reasonably well on the leash. He is slowly but surely learning his basic commands. When not distracted too much, he does well with \"come\" and \"sit\" and is starting to learn to \"stay\". He still jumps up a bit when excited, but is much improved and knows to keep All4Paws on the ground to get his treat.\"\n\nAll dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, current on vaccinations, de-wormed, heartworm tested, current on heartworm and flea prevention, receive dental's and blood work if needed and receive full physical examinations from a board certified veterinarian.\n\n\nAFTER completing your adoption application, please schedule an adoption appointment at the earliest time possible. Please note: We do NOT hold animals. To make your appointment, go to: https://app.waitwhile.com/welcome/all4paws\n\nNOTICE: You will not be able to take an animal home the day of your appointment if you have not filled out an application before scheduling your appointment. \nAll 4 Paws is 501 (c) 3 non-profit animal rescue based out of Pawleys Island, SC. Our adoption center in is located at 708 Petigru Dr Pawleys Island SC 29585.\n\nVisit our website at all4pawssc.org and \"like\" us on facebook: www.facebook.com/all4pawssc",

For his safety and the safety of his mommy his dad will like to find him another loving home. Zeus is 2.5 years old and weights 130 pounds so he is a big boy. He has had obedience training, most of which is in German.  The training comes with a lifetime warranty through the trainer.  He would do best with a single male since he doesn't respond well to females and in a home with kids over the age of 12. Zeus is very loving and sweet but he is a boy that needs an experience dad who understands the breed and is willing to continue helping Zeus be the best dog he can be. This cutie has been around other dogs but slow introduction is recommended and he will most likely do better with dogs that are over 50 pounds.",

            "description": "Hermes joined our rescue on October 27th from Georgia in search of his new forever home.  This poor guy has been through a lot in the last year :-(.  His owner had passed away and he had a life long friend named Gizmo.  When his owner passed, he was taken in by a family who had dogs, cats and kids.  Life was good for about 9 months, but then all the dogs started squabbling; the husband and wife got a divorce and Hermes and Gizmo found themselves living on a screened in porch for 3 months.  As you can figure the story.....they ended up at the shelter.  Gizmo and Hermes were separated and now trying to figure out life by themselves in new and scary places :-(.\n\nHermes is nervous when meeting new people.  He can give a bark and even growl, but he does warm up once he knows you.  We are letting him settle in at his own pace.  Hermes loves to go for walks and has this cute prance/trot while walking :-).  He is house trained and seems to just be a couch potato....as most senior dogs can be.  He is pretty quiet and has only barked when the house dog did...LOL!  His foster home has an older, smaller dog that he has been completely fine with.\n\nWe feel since Hermes is nervous in meeting new people, no children in the house.  The most ideal home for this senior boy is a quiet one with not a lot of \"traffic\".  He really just wants to chill out and relax without a lot of chaos!  Who can blame him!!\n\nHermes is 10 years old and appears to be a Jack Russell Terrier mix weighing in at 20 lbs.  We have had him to the vet and did his bloodwork, urinalysis and fecal tests.  He is current on vaccines, neutered, and current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention.  His adoption fee is $250.\n\nIf you are interested in Hermes, please submit an application on our website at https://worthytails.rescuegroups.org.  For any questions you have, please send an email to jessie.wilson@comcast.net.\n\nThank you for your interest in a senior, rescue dog!!  \n",

            "description": "Cohen is an adorable, affectionate, Pittie/Lab mix who is 3 years old and weighs 57 lbs.  He is a sweet, gentle, easy going, boy who was a staff favorite at the Walker County shelter where he was picked up as a stray.  He is a happy, friendly, sometimes timid boy who would do well in just about any household.  He craves human interaction so he's looking for a person/family where he can spend time with his people during the day.  He is a playful, medium energy boy who needs a tall fence in his yard because if his person steps onto the other side of the fence where he can see them, he may try to jump the fence to be with them.  Cohen gets along with kids & other dogs, but needs slow introductions, and is afraid of cats (he walks away from the cat in his foster home when he sees her).  When meeting new dogs he typically limits his actions to mutual sniffing & is otherwise disinterested.  He would do well with other dog who doesn't repeatedly try to engage him.  He has good leash manners (pulls occasionally, but responds to correction), knows basic commands (crate & sit), and loves car rides.  He is a handsome boy with the cutest jowls ever and he'll be a loyal, devoted companion for the lucky person/family that adopts him!\n\nCohen is housebroken, crate trained, neutered, fully vaccinated & microchipped.  He was HW+ when he came to BarkVille but has completed his treatment and is now healthy & ready to find his loving, forever home!\n\nFor more information about Cohen, please email us at info@barkvilledogrescue.org. If you would like to adopt sweet Cohen, please submit an application for him at https://www.barkvilledogrescue.org/applications",

            "description": "Athena is an incredible girl! Looking for a dog who loves people? Look no further! Looking for a dog who is fun-loving, athletic, and a joy to be around? Athena is more than qualified! \n\nAthena is an American Bulldog, and she is some kind of wonderful! She was found as a stray and was thin. She was very stressed at the shelter, and she really needed to get out of the shelter environment. We asked to take her so she could recover. \n\nAthena is a big and strong girl, currently weighing about 85-90 pounds.  She is very athletic and active, and loves playing with her toys! However, she loves snuggling with her humans and really longs to be a part of a family. She gives the best kisses, and just loves to love and cuddle. \n\nAthena initially was very reactive to other dogs, but she has improved SO MUCH! There are some dogs here that she likes to lay beside on either side of the fence. She has a best friend at the rescue, and they will be walked together as weather allows. \n\nAthena requires a fenced yard with a 6 foot privacy fence. She needs the opportunity for supervised play so she can remain healthy (physically and mentally). She needs continued work with manners, but she has improved by leaps and bounds!  She does well with kids, but they should be at least 8 or 10 years old or older, only because she doesn\u2019t realize how big she is and she can knock over younger ones by accident. \n\nWe would love for Athena to find her family so she can cuddle and play as much as she wants.  We would need her new family to live within about an hour of Greenwood Indiana.\n\nNOTE: If you are interested in adopting Athena, please reply with your email, or email us directly at Heartbeat4paws@gmail.com and we will send you an application.  Also, please note that an in-person home visit is required prior to adoption, and cannot be waived. We will gladly take appropriate precautions as needed for the safety and comfort of all.",

            "description": "IMPORTANT!!!   All adoptions are by appointment only going forward and are spaced 30 minutes apart. PLEASE call the shelter directly during business hours for more information (see number below).  You need to make sure that the animal in which you have an interest is still available and to set up an appointment to meet the specific animal.  DO NOT USE the e-mail attached to this account. Once you arrive at the shelter for your scheduled appointment, please follow the directions that you were given over the telephone. If you are running late for your appointment or will be unable to make your scheduled appointment time, notify staff immediately. This will enable them to schedule that time for another prospective adoptive family. If necessary, they will be able to reschedule your appointment to a more convenient time.  \n\nARTHUR is available for adoption! However, only to a family/home that can properly confine him which means either in their home or in a securely fenced yard. He is listed as a lab/bulldog mix and he is black in color with white on his chest. He is estimated to be four years old and he weighed 75 pounds at his intake in late August.  ARTHUR arrived at the shelter after reportedly killing a small dog. He had been running loose at the time and it was not the first time he had been picked up. So, he also cannot go to a home that has small dogs. The alleged attack has not been verified as nobody filed a report with animal control to document it. Staff has no way of knowing how he would be around any other dogs or cats. Staff says that he is a very happy dog and a sweet one, too. You can schedule an adoption appointment to meet him. Or, you can just call staff for any other observations they may have about his behavior at the shelter during his time there. A big thank you to the staff member who agreed, and was able, to get him outside for some decent photos while we still have sunlight. His shiny, pretty coat and his big smile show much better outside than they would from a photo taken inside the shelter. ARTHUR is a pretty dog and people friendly. He has not yet been neutered. So, please read the important information below.\n\nAdoption fees are $80 for dogs.  Cat adoption fees are $50. Cash or check only. Please be sure to take the exact amount with you.\n\nThe shelter routinely vaccinates all healthy appearing animals upon their arrival at the shelter and deworms them.  Any animals not already spayed/neutered must have the procedure done through the veterinary clinic that contracts with the county before that animal can be released from the clinic to the new family. By state law, animals old enough to be given a rabies vaccine, must have that vaccine done, as well.  The vaccine is given by the veterinary clinic staff at a separate cost to the adoptive family. \n\nHold periods for every incoming animal vary for several reasons including, but not limited to, whether the animal came in from the Cumberland County area, or from the City of Crossville, which contracts with the county for its animal shelter services.  Check with the staff to verify the availability date of every animal for which you have an interest.\n\nFor more information on this pet, call the shelter at (931)484-8525. The shelter is open Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday from 10am to 2pm. Closed Wednesday and Sunday and county observed holidays.",

            "description": "To be considered for adopting a dog from Canine Lifeline, you must have an approved application must be on file. Please visit http://www.caninelifeline.org/adoption-process/ for more information about our adoption process and to submit an online application.\n\nYou'd be hard-pressed to find a cuter guy than Humphrey, a 5 year-old Pug/Terrier mix male who came to Canine Lifeline from an overcrowded rural county dog shelter. We don't know how Humphrey came to be in the shelter but he was happy to make the trip to Canine Lifeline so he could enjoy life in a foster home while searching for a permanent new home. This little guy was adopted from us in Oct 2020 but recently returned because he proved to be too energetic and dominant for the other little dog in the home. Humphrey does like to have things his way so needs a dog-experienced owner (preferably a single woman) who is able to manage him properly and set him up for success. Humphrey is crate-trained and likely to be housetrained too although we can't guarantee that he won't have accidents in his new home as he gets used to his new routine. He enjoys going out for a walk and does quite well on a leash. While he becomes very attached to his people, Humphrey can be nervous when meeting new people so needs a quiet home without many visitors. If there's another dog in the home, it will need to be one who can handle rough play but who is also able to live with Humphrey's desire to be in charge. He's a short and stocky little guy who definitely likes his snacks so will need a home where he will get lots of walks around the block in combination with moderate snacking so that he doesn't get too chubby. Humphrey weighs about 21 pounds and his adoption fee is $375. He's neutered, heartworm negative and on monthly preventative, up to date on vaccinations including bivalent canine influenza, wormed, on flea and tick preventative, and microchipped. Since coming to us, Humphrey has had a dental cleaning and now flashes a pearly white smile. As part of the adoption process, all adopters must commit to a two-week adjustment period to make sure it's a great match before the adoption is finalized. Please email info@caninelifeline.org if you're interested in Humphrey. An approved application is required before we schedule meets with any of our dogs. Please note that we don't place our dogs in homes with children under 7 years of age. We correspond via email so please check your junkmail or spam folder to make sure our reply hasn't landed in there. Please visit our website at www.caninelifeline.org to see more photos of Humphrey and to submit an online application if you live in Northeast OH.",

Cruiser is, in fact, a happy and sweet boy who can be quite affectionate with his people. He comes close and brushes up against you to get your attention. He enjoys his walks and to explore,  seeing the sights and sniffing the smells. Cruiser will take control of the leash if you let him, but is learning on his training walks. Around other dogs, Cruiser can be a bit vocal when saying hello.  He enjoys the company of female dogs but isn't too sure about some males, especially pushy types. With proper introduction and guidance, Cruiser does well in a pack walk and when saying hello in canine playgroups.   Cruiser came to us after suffering lean times.  So if you are ready to provide Cruiser with good guidance and yummy meals, fill out an application!\n\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website!

We took in a momma dog, which we named Latte, and her three puppies when they were still nursing. Someone had abanonded them at a dumpster in the woods!!! It was absolutely heartbreaking. Due to Covid Restrictions, we have had these sweet puppies for almost a year! We adopted momma and one of the puppies this summer but we are still trying to find homes for Espresso and Cappuccino. Both of these girls are beyond precious! Espresso just turned a year old. She is a spayed Terrier mix weighing about 35 lbs. she is not expected to grow anymore! She has beautiful markings with a hilarious curled up tail! Her tail describes her entire personality.... silly and energetic! She loves to run and play. She is great with other dogs, kids and loves everyone she meets. Espresso needs to be adopted to a family with another dog and a fenced in yard! If you think you need a shot of this espresso, please email us at LongJ1003@aol.com and Katybug6067@gmail.com.",

            "description": "Allow us to introduce Bodhi and share his survival story!\n\n10-year-old Bodhi was found trapped in a small canal at a Tijuana park. His rescuer reached out to us and asked if we could help Bodhi get medical care and find a forever family. She believed Bodhi had been used as a bait dog and then discarded in the canal where he was found. Bodhi arrived at Frosted Faces on October 23rd with gaping wounds, so skinny you could see every rib, and jaundice to the point his gums were more yellow than pink. His recovery has been miraculous and he hardly looks like the same dog anymore!\n\nBodhi became a quick favorite of our volunteer physical therapist who donates her time and skills to help some of our worst off Frosted Faces. She spent a lot of time with Bodhi doing laser therapy on his wounds. She shared, \"Bodhi exemplifies all of what is so special about dogs. He is most forgiving and loving. The condition he arrived in was heart wrenching. Bodhi was a willing and accepting recipient to all of the care he received and continues to receive. I feel fortunate to be apart of his wound and heart healing. He allowed me to provide manual therapy, laser therapy, and wound care. His profound improvement has been remarkable, especially in a relatively short period of time. Bodhi's incredible spirit and willingness to overcome what appears to have been something awful, serves as a role model for anyone going thru something really tough.\"\n\nAs Bodhi's recovery progressed, he began going on walks and then hikes with volunteers. They report he enjoys walking, sniffing, and taking breaks for treats and pets. Bodhi hangs out with other Frosted Faces in our play yards and gets along well with them. He loves to be petted by everyone he meets and get belly rubs, too! Bodhi is a sweet and gentle boy who has earned the privilege of being one of our lobby dogs. It is so fun to see Bodhi full of life and acting like a house dog! He sits on the couch and does wrestle mania in the yard! He begs for food, and helps \"scoop dinners\" by sticking his whole head in the feeding tub and stealing kibbles.\n\nOn January 28th, Bodhi had FHO surgery. A femoral head osteotomy is the removal of the \"ball\" part of the ball-and-socket that makes up the hip joint. This way, the bones of the joint are no longer in contact, which eliminates the pain that is caused by the abnormal contact of the bones in a dog with hip dysplasia or severe osteoarthritis. Bodhi came through surgery really well and was out enjoying walks with his Frosted Friends the next day!\n\nBodhi is available for adoption, but we would like to keep him local to the San Diego area for his medical appointments. We will cover his care for the rest of his life.\n\nStop by and meet magicial and miraculous Bodhi at our next Open House!\n\nVisit us at Open House: Saturdays & Sundays, 10 am - 1 pm.\n\nLearn more about our programs at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family. No adoption fees and we help with medical costs!\n\nApply to become a family at: www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\nUpdated: 1/31/21 KG",

I was at animal control uncomfortable with yucky skin issues, hair loss and infected ear \u2013 ouch!  Thankfully Mostly Mutts came to rescue me and quickly started addressing my needs.  I am now feeling good and am ready to find a furever family to love!    \n\n\u2022 OTHER DOGS/CATS/KIDS:  I\u2019m looking for a home without other dogs as I have not liked the one\u2019s I met at MM\u2019s / Cats unknown / I\u2019m looking for a home with no kids please. I met two children at Mostly Mutts (ages 7 and 11), and I did NOT like it when they ran around near me, and I showed a little aggression over it.   \n\n\u2022 PERSONALITY/ENERGY LEVEL:  I am a friendly girl with an absolutely adorable nature.  The volunteers say I\u2019m sweet, social and charming.  Though I am an older girl, you would never know it when you see my playful side / My energy level is pretty high at 6-8, so I do like activity.\n\n\u2022 SKILLS/CRATE/POTTY:  I'm a proud graduate of the Mostly Mutts University training program, so, I\u2019ve mastered the \u2018sit\u2019, \u2018stay\u2019, \u2018down\u2019, \u2018come\u2019, \u2018drop it\u2019, \u2018leave it\u2019 and \u2018place\u2019 commands.  I also use proper door etiquette and have good leash manners as well as accept nice strangers without jumping.  What a smart girl I am! / My crate manners are good at Mostly Mutts / I also have good potty habits on the shelter schedule, so hopefully that will be the case in my new home too.\n\n\u2022 LIKES/DISLIKES:  I LOVE people and enjoy the company of the volunteers who care for me at the shelter \u2013 especially when they take me to the play yard for my favorite activity \u2013 fetching balls! I love all kinds of doggie toys and really enjoy my training sessions, since I am a fan of treats and I like to learn. I also like to chase squirrels and chipmunks \u2013 he he / I can\u2019t think of any dislikes, but I would not be happy if I did not get the love, care and attention all dogs deserve!  \n\n\u2022 MEDICAL:   I'm current on vaccinations, micro-chipped and spayed.  \n\nI am looking for a fun family to enjoy life with!  My adoption fee is $299.00, and I\u2019m located in Kennesaw, Ga.  \n",

I was hurting, covered in demodex mange and had hookworms. I thought my time was up, but once I was found, they got Just Cause rescue to take me in and get me well. My foster mom loves me, and gave me a warm bed to sleep in, and some good food. She says she can't keep me, but will find me a good home, where I'll be loved. I hope shes right. I get on with other dogs, not sure about cats, cause there's none at my foster moms house. I'm still a little clumsy around the small dogs, but I do give them lots of kisses, even when they don't want them. All my fur has now grown back, and I have a beautiful brindle colored coat. Short hair, and haven't shed in my mom's house.\nI'm about 9 months old, up to date on all my vaccinations,  and spayed. I weigh 35lbs.\nPlease will you consider taking me in. I am kennel trained and potty trained, and working on my leash training now. Hope to see you soon, I'm ready to give you some kisses xx.",

            "description": "If your looking for personality, Im your girl. I also come with training from JD's Powerhouse K9 Bootcamp. I am down for anything, hiking, biking, climbing, agility and I even have search and rescue type talents. I can climb ladders and I am an adventurous girl. I also enjoy an occasional couch time and Netflix. \nI am okay with most dogs, but if you have another dog, I will require the right intro and it has to be a certain type of dog too. I prefer no cats or little dogs. \nA mature home with some doggie experience is best for me as I am a high drive type of girl ready to rock. \n\nI want this to be my forever home too, so only serious people need to inquire. \n\nIm approx 2 yrs old and about 50lbs. I am spayed, chipped and current with my vaccines. \n\nAn application process does apply and a home check will also apply. \n\nMy adoption fee is $100.00 and I also come with training so you and I can get acquainted and I can show you all of my skills. \n\nNOTE*****You MUST  submit an application if you are interested. Emails from this site will not be answered. We require an application prior to contacting to discuss more details. The website to submit your application is www.bullyprideofaz.com\n\nThis post is a courtesy post, which means I am not an official Bully Pride dog. But once you complete your application, my original rescuer, Sherry will review. Sherry is an awesome lady that rescued me from the streets. Bully Pride of Arizona is helping to facilitate and ensure I am placed into the best home that is the best match for me and you.",

My friend offered to take him and foster him. This is what she has to say about Teddy:\n\n\nTeddy is 3 years old. Good with kids and people and dogs not so good with little dogs. I introduce him slowly to other dogs and would prefer him to be only pet. Not cat friendly. He doesn\u2019t bark at them but he stares at them and I believe he would maybe hurt a cat. He loves loves loves tennis balls. He brings them inside into his kennel. He has 14 in his kennel right now.  He needs his own yard so he gets to play fetch. He doesn\u2019t like being left. He barks in kennel but does good lose in house. Large metal kennel is best for him and zip tie the sides.\n\nNot destructive. He feels more relaxed when he is away from other dogs inside. Loves being in car and doesn\u2019t mind being in his kennel. He actually likes it but doesn\u2019t like when I leave him in there when I leave. He barks for about 5 minutes then stops. He is a people dog.",

We are a foster-based rescue in Chicago-land, which means that each dog is placed with a family in the area. This allows us to better understand each dog's individual personalities. \n\nYou must complete an application before you can schedule a meet and greet with each animal. The application can be found here: http://peaceforpits.org/adoptionfoster-application/ or if you prefer a Word version, download it here: https://goo.gl/bKo84P and email it to p4papplications@gmail.com. Our adoption fee is typically $350 for an adult dog, and $400 for a dog under one year. It includes all vetting and spay/neuter.",

He is working with a trainer until we can get him adopted.  He is an active dog and cannot live in any home with a senior owner. Absolutely no children or grandkids. \n\nHi There,\n\nMy name is Jo Jo. I am a very active, handsome 4 year old black n white Cavalier-Sussex Spaniel mix or could be some Basset in me. I was bought from a breeder who passed me off as an English Cocker.  Not sure just why, but my owner dropped me off at a NC shelter where I was alone and scared. A rescue group took me into their care where I had several foster homes. Then I was flown across NC to another place. This was scary and stressful. I bit three people while being handled. This rescue group didn't know quite how to deal with my behavior issue so they looked into help from another rescue willing to work with me. Transport was arranged and I did pretty well on the initial meet n greet. Every day I've been here these folks are working with me, challenging me, correcting me and teaching me how to behave like a good dog should. \n\nI am heartworm negative, current on shots and I have been neutered. I need an adult only home with a good alpha owner willing to work with me, not give up on me and can truly give me a 2nd chance in a home with a good life.  The best environment for me is a calm home with very few distractions, no children, no grand children and no senior owners.\n\nMy adoption fee is $350.",

But, it's harder to do at the shelter. Think you can help me out at your house? I'm going to need a quieter  home with a fenced yard. Hopefully someone too, that will play fetch with me, but no young children.\n\n\n<p>Please visit <a href=\"http://www.petrefuge.com\">www.petrefuge.com</a> for more information or to fill out an adoption application.</p>",

            "description": "Hi, everyone! I've been in my foster home for 3 months now, and have been making great progress. I'm much better at pottying outside, but am primarily pad trained. While I'm still afraid of humans, I've decided that my foster parents aren't so bad. They still have to catch me in order to pet and snuggle me, but I now settle right in and fall asleep on the couch with all my other fur siblings. I also don't run away from mom and dad as quickly or as far as I used to, and I return to them much faster.\n\nI've found my voice and bark when I know it's dinner time, or when I decide mom and dad have something delicious that I'd like to try. I come right up to them for treats, too. I try to play with my foster brother and sisters, but they're older than I am and sometimes aren't interested. I still require a fenced yard, and it would be great if I could find a home with another dog to be my buddy.A home with no kids would be best, or a home with children older than 12 if there are kids.\n\nWhile I still don't care for a leash, my mom has put a harness on me a couple of times and I do better with the harness. I'm still not ready for walks, but I'm making some progress. Baby steps! \n\nI'm being fostered in Antioch, IL and my adoption fee is $350. If you're interested in applying to adopt me, please contact Anna, my foster mom, at 847.757.1748 or annabaker2011@gmail.com.\n\n\n",

I guess I just got bored!  I have all of my vaccinations, I am heartworm negative, I have a microchip, and I have been spayed. I am a one-year-old retriever mix. Maybe my new home should have a tall privacy fence. Then maybe I wouldn\u2019t be tempted to try and escape! Or maybe I could spend more time inside the house with you!  FYI...I already know how to play fetch and I am great at that game!!",

            "description": "Meet Benson! This handsome boy is about 3.5 years old and 70 lbs of love! Benson loves nothing more than to feel safe and snuggle on the couch or lounge around with his humans. He is very sweet and gives a lot of love! Benson is great with humans (kids 10+ ok too) and loves to meet new people. He\u2019s very smart and quick to learn new tricks like high five, paw, stay, sit and lay. He\u2019s also crate and potty trained! Benson was not properly trained or introduced to other animals early on in his life, so he has a high prey drive. We are working with a trainer in Eugene, OR who is helping him appropriately react to other animals. However, due to his reactivity, he will need a home where he is the only pet and has a very secure (6ft +) and solid fenced yard (no chain link or other see through fences). Benson has learned a communication system built on rewards and positive verbal markers. This system can be used to continue to develop and nurture his self confidence. Much of his dog reactivity is rooted in a lack of feeling safe. To thrive he will need a strong leader to advocate for him, manage his occasional outbursts of leash reactivity (towards cats/dogs) and to protect him from harm. His ideal match is someone mentally alert enough and physically strong enough to correct and redirect him when he fails to control his impulses. He enjoys affection and praise which can be used as a form of reward. Due to Benson's strength and size, a muzzle should always be worn when out in public. He does have mild separation anxiety and is more comfortable when his human is with him. He is crate trained which can be used at times when he must be left alone. He has shown no signs of human aggression or resource guarding but he seems to have had previous success grabbing the leash away from his handler when overstimulated or frustrated. Another reason a muzzle is ideal for leash walking or being on leash in public. Benson needs a family or best friend who can manage his size and strength, and is ok with him staying at home or playing in the yard (and being managed appropriately). He is not for someone looking for a running or walking partner, or someone that wants to take their dog out to the breweries. He is a sweet human bonded dog that wants to be by your side at home, and will reward you with lots of snuggles and kisses. Benson's trainer has graciously offered to help any potential adopter with transitioning Benson into his new home and provide support. Benson has had a tremendously difficult life but he is ready to find love and support in a family who loves him. Benson was rescued from a shelter in Los Angeles, CA and is being fostered in Eugene, OR. Will you be his hero?",

The caretakers at RCHS would describe me as being in the PURPLE category. PURPLE\u2013 Dogs in the PURPLE category are very shy and will need equally patient adopters that have experience in confidence building. Dogs in the PURPLE category may also benefit from having another confident canine in the home.\n\nDogs are assigned to color categories using any previous owner notes, general handling, as well as staff and volunteer observations. As we continue to get to know the dogs and gather further insights into their personalities, colors may be adjusted accordingly.\n\nRancho Coastal Humane Society remains temporarily closed to the general public, but we have companion animals in our care that are ready for adoption BY APPOINTMENT ONLY, and our staff is ready to make that happen! Please visit our website for updates and more information. Thank you for your interest. \n\nAdoption Hours: Monday-Sunday; 11 AM to 4:30 PM\n\nAddress: 389 Requeza Street, Encinitas, CA 92024",

She needs to go to a home with a yard she can run in and/or with an active family that will take her on walks. \nNo cats for this girl.   She will need a home with breed experience and a fenced in yard is required.  \nShe does not like to share her food with other dogs.  She is getting better at learning boundaries but her new home will need to continue working with her. \nShe is crate and house trained and is looking for a great home to call her own! \nPlease visit www.zoeshouserescue.com to complete an application.

He loves to be held and snuggled, and is quite a talker when he has something to say (like being put down! Lol). He\u2019s getting along well with our other pugs and is quite social.\n\nElmer was rescued from a shelter and we know very little about his past, other than it was rough. His age is estimated to be 11-ish.  Unfortunately, this little guy has a laundry list of issues that we will be addressing:\n1. heartworm+\n2. ehrlichia (blood condition)\n3. ear infection\n4. conjunctivitis and dry eye\n5. yeasty skin\n6. severe hip dysplasia that may require surgery (Rimadyl for now)\n\nElmer will eventually go through heartworm treatment. In the meantime, his eyes and ears are getting treated, he\u2019s on an antibiotic for the ehrlichia, and he\u2019ll be getting baths with Pharmaseb medicated shampoo twice a week for his skin. He\u2019s a skinny little guy that we are trying to fatten up. And he has scrawny little chicken legs with a wonky gate. It doesn\u2019t seem to slow him down much, but we hope he\u2019ll get stronger with time.\n\nFoster Elmer won\u2019t be ready to adopt for some time, but keep following his journey, and please consider making a donation to PugHearts toward his care.\n",

In a couple of ways, Birch can be slightly mischievous. He can jump with ease, so a four-foot fence would not likely stop him from flying over. He can be a bit of a rough-and-tumble player with other dogs, so any other dogs in the home would need to be tolerant of that. Birch has been with us since early October, and the shelter environment has been stressful for him. A patient, loving home with plenty of couch space for naps would likely take all of his anxieties away!",

If you're looking for a running buddy, I'd be just the guy for you. I can be a little shy at first, but once I get to know you, I'll be your very best friend. I would prefer a home that has older children or adults only. I like to have my space respected so I enjoy those that understand how to read my body language. I think I would also be best as the only pet in the home. I truly enjoy being the center of attention and love being loved on. In return for all your love and snuggles, I'll make the cutest pup faces! You can get so many cute pictures of my floppy ear too. So if you're looking for an Instagram worthy doggo, look no further! I\"m the guy for you. Adopt me today!",

            "description": "**This dog is with Corridor Rescue in Houston, Texas**\n\nDudley was rescued in September, along with his buddy Boomer. Knowing he had a limp when we rescued him, we knew we could be looking at fairly large vet bills. BUT, we're not in rescue to save money, we're in rescue to save dogs. \nHowever, Dudley is one of the very rare cases where things turn out to be better than they appear! After observing this bundle of joy who is so happy to be alive, it has been determined that since he's using his leg normally and does not appear to be in any pain, his leg stays! If, in the future, he looks to be in pain or quits using his leg, amputation is the only option as it is a completely healed fracture. \nSo, Dudley remains a 4-legged, happy-go-lucky, goofy boy. And he's looking for his forever home!\n\n***\nPlease apply to foster or adopt online at www.corridorrescue.org\n\nDirect inquiries to: adopt@corridorrescue.org\n\nThe adoption fee of $225 covers spay/neuter, microchip and current vaccines.\n\nTransport is available and can be discussed on an individual basis.\n\nThank you for considering a rescued former street dog for your next family member!",

Before that, she had lived her life on a chain. When her \"owners\" were located and contacted, they had no interest in taking her back or giving her the loved life she so deserves, so her Good Samaritan Guardian Angel kept her safe until rescue could be secured. \n \n\nJersey came to RMG just one day before giving birth! She was a great mom to all of her pups but now she has declared that her Mom days are over and she is ready to be spoiled and pampered herself! Jersey is good with other dogs and absolutely LOVES people!\n \n\nSadly, just like about one in three dogs we rescue Jersey is heartworm positive. RMG utilizes a slow kill method of treatment developed at UGA that does not require any exercise restrictions or changes to daily life. All treatment related medications are provided and there are typically no lasting health effects after successful treatment. \n\nInterested in adopting this sweet princess and showing her what life is like as a beloved family member?

Herbert is currently under treatment for heartworm.\nHerbert is a smart dude who knows sit, down and cuddle time!\nThis handsome 7 year old-boy loves people. Herbert is truly a happy and outgoing boy and loves pets and snuggle time. Herbert is dog selective. He has done well with some of the big dogs during play time and he could possibly do well with another dog with proper intro if it is the right match. We are asking for no young children because of his size (he doesn't realize he's a big boy who can throw a lot of weight around). Herbert is very sweet and he is so ready for his forever family!\nTo learn more about him, send us an email at adoptycas@gmail.com\n\nAll animals are up-to-date on vaccinations (including rabies if over 4 months old), microchipped, and spayed or neutered. All dogs have been been vaccinated with DHPP and Bordatella (kennel cough) and heartworm tested negative (if over 6 months).\n\nAll cats have been vaccinated with FVRCP and current on flea control. Please click on the link for Yolo County Animal Services for more information.\n\n2/1/21 9:03 PM",

This bubbly and energetic girl was surrendered to the shelter because her owner was no longer able to keep her where they lived.  As a result, Marla is looking for a new family that can keep up!  She is looking for an energetic family that can provide daily playtime and exercise as well as lots of mental stimulation to keep her busy.  She would also benefit from obedience training to help her learn new tricks and work on her leash manners.  Marla seems to do well with other energetic dogs but must find a home without cats or other small animals.  She would do well in a home with teens that can help her exercise but may be too much for children.  If this sounds like your perfect match, come meet Marla.\n\nAdoption Fee:  $180.00    \n",

Please read our Frequently Asked Questions and Adoption Processed Explained documentation.\n_________ B I O ______________\n\nName:Collin\nSize: ~Large range: 61-100 lbs\nAdoption Donation:$250 (applicable sales tax included).Adoption fees may be paid by cash or check.\nOther:Neutered Male, Vaccinations current, Microchip, Older considerate children only, NOT Apartment-friendly\n\nCollinwill be extremely happy to have a forever home.\n\nFoster Home Feedback\n\n*\nNOT Apartment-friendly\n\n*\nOlder considerate children only\n\n1/10/21: Collin has been in my home a little over a month now, and he has been loving getting spoiled!! He came into my home because his former foster thought he would thrive in a home with younger dogs to play with. Over Christmas, my three grandkids ages 4, 5, and 9, and their 5 Chihuahuas spent the week visiting, and he did very well with all of them. He had so much fun playing with the grandkids and the 5 Chi's that when we dropped him off at his former fosters on Christmas Eve, for the night, he slept for 15 hours straight.\n\nHe loves to snuggle and knows no personal spaces; Collin will take over the entire bed or couch if you let him. He loves to be outdoors, once he goes out it is hard to get him back inside. He likes to go out and sit on the deck or in the middle of the yard and scan for rabbits, he does not care if it is snowing or sleeting or if it is day or night.\n\nCollin is a very typical young pup, he is just a great big oaf and a blockhead, who thinks everything is a toy. When he first got here, he and I had to have a few conversations and redirections on why my shoes were not his toys, since then he has been fairly good about that. He is also a huge goofball, and good for some laughs because he is big and clumsy.\n\nOverall, Collin is just a big, loveable goofball that just wants a forever home where he can snuggle on the couch with his forever person or people, hog the bed at night, protect them from the big bad rabbits in the backyard and smother them in love and kisses.\n\nWith some training and lots of snuggling, this boy will be a great companion for some lucky forever home.\n\n11/23/2020: Collin is loving the home life! I've been taking Collin to a basic manners class at Down Dog Studio, and he is a model student. He is learning so quickly and is super treat-motivated.\n\nCollin would thrive in a house with a dog playmate who can match his energy. He loves to run and loves to wrestle. I have a 10lb Chihuahua with no teeth who loves to instigate fights with Collin, which Collin perceives as playtime! While my Chi is trying to inflict damage with his gums, Collin is gentle enough (dumb enough?) to play and not actually hurt my idiot dog.\n\nCollin does great on walks. He doesn't pull much, especially with the use of an EZ Walk harness. We are working through some car reactivity, but again, he is super treat-motivated, and it will be easy to redirect this behavior.\nCollin loves car rides! He jumps in, sits down, and hardly makes a peep.\n\nCollin is great with both people and dogs. This weekend, he met three young kids ON bikes, and only gave kisses! No bike reactivity, no kid reactivity, no stranger danger. I do think Collin would need only older kids in his house as he is high energy and could knock some little ones over easily.\n\nOnce Collin gets settled down, he is a giant snuggle bug. He loves to cuddle. He is absolutely a bed hog, but is the cuddliest goofball you'll ever meet!\nTo sum up, Collin is an oversized puppy. He has a ton of energy that he needs a dog playmate to help work out, and a house that can offer him both physical and mental exercise and stimulation. He is super smart and will train easily! Collin will be an amazing companion and is looking for the right house to jump into.\n\n10/7/2020: Collin is doing great in his foster home. He is learning that his kennel means a Sunbutter Kong and a handful of treats! He is slowly learning \"sit,\" \"gentle,\" and \"leave it.\" Collin is still very energetic and will need someone who can provide a lot of both mental and physical activity/exercise. Collin is still a young dude and has a lot of energy that he doesn't know how to express. We're trying to learn how to greet guests at the door, as right now, he is very jumpy and mouthy.\n\nCollin is a very sweet boy who just wants someone to play with. He is dog friendly and loves people (no stranger danger with this guy). He walks great on an EZ Walk harness, with minimal pulling when he sees local wildlife. Collin's prey drive is very strong and he loves to chase. So we are also working with impulse control. Collin is going to need someone who is willing to work with him. I think Collin is going to be a really great companion for someone who realizes and can work with his potential!\n\n9/15/2020: Colin! Colin is a rambunctious and playful guy! He is lacking in some basic manners, but we are working on it. He is a very typical young Lab (mix) with lots of energy, and the propensity to find anything as a toy. He does well with redirecting. Colin is pretty quiet inside, but does bark a lot outside, especially at urban wildlife. We have some neighbor squirrels who love to tease the dogs and drive them bonkers. He seems to love everyone and other dogs. On walks, Colin does fairly well but is showing some reactivity to cars. Again, he redirects very easily and feeds off positive praise.\n\nI have been crating Colin while I am out, and he does not like it. I have been working on this as well with him. He has escaped from a wire kennel, and will require a more closed kennel to contain him. At night, he sleeps so soundly on my bed with me and my resident dogs. He looooooves to snuggle and will snore in your ear all night. I don't think he slept on a soft bed until he came into rescue.\n\nI would not recommend a house with young children, as Colin is still very full of energy and is in his jumpy and mouthy phase of young dog age. He would do well with someone who can devote time into training him and give him some good exercise to burn off his energy.\n\nColin is a very sweet boy who is learning that home life is a great life. Please consider this happy boy for your companion!\n\n9/7/2020: Colin has awesome leash manners; no pulling and just a great walker. Colin is treat-motivated and also likes to give hugs!

            "description": "Renaissance (or 'Reni' as her friends call her) has given birth to her last litter of pups and is ready to reinvent herself! She is an enthusiastic player, preferring rough and tumble play with a dog her size, so her new best friend can keep up with her. She tends to have a bit of trouble making friends because not everyone wants to play with a wiggle butt body slamming into you, but when you have as much energy as this fun girl, thats the BEST way to play! Do you think that you (and your existing doggo, if you have one) are strong enough, both physically strong and strong willed, to be part of Reni's new family? She would love for you to join in her journey of learning about being part of a family, and maybe even a trick or two!!All SAAP animals are vet checked, UTD on vaccines, spayed/neutered, micro chipped, and given flea and heartworm preventative as age appropriate.\n\nOur website is: http://www.adoptastray.com/\n\nTo check if this animal is still available visit our master pet list on our website at:\nhttp://www.adoptastray.com/adoptable-animals/\n\nHave questions:\nPlease email us at saap@adoptastray.com for more information about this animal or to answer any questions you may have.

I came to Rescue Village after spending several months at another shelter. Coco will do best in a home without small/young children and she prefers to be the only furry companion in the home.\n\nA word from Coco's foster family: She is housebroken and has not chewed on anything that is not hers. She is really a very loving dog. No barking or whining. Well, she will bark a little in the car when we are going for a walk, just a bit, not constant. She plays and prances with her toys, then she settles down for awhile. We are able to get her out for walks a lot, several times a\nday, and I think that helps control the energy. \n\nLike most of us, she doesn't care to get wet when it's raining, and she seems content to settle down and relax when it's raining and does not beg to go out. She will be a great, loving dog for someone who can give her enough exercise, either walking or a fenced yard.",

She's a great dog who really just wants to be with her human.  She's loved everyone she meets and is very loving. I'm guessing she's probably housetrained cause I have to let her out of her kennel to go potty. Glinda also gets along with cats.  We spent a lot of money on her teeth so she could be pain free.  She got two root canals on her bottom K-9s.  She's doing great and is now ready for her forever home.",

He, Caleb Fiona, Jackson and June were surrendered to ATDR by a family who could no longer care for them They are stunningly beautiful, well-bred long-haired babies whose family loved them enough to want them to find another forever home where they would be cherished and well cared for. They are all friendly, affectionate little treasures who will quickly warm anyone's heart and lap. Racer is very loving and would like nothing more than to be in your lap for the rest of his days. Racer doesn't like stairs so would prefer to be carried or needs a home without steps!\nRacer was shaved by a groomer because of tangles in his long hair instead of patiently working the tangles out. He'll be as stunning as all the others when his beautiful red coat grows back soon...\nIf you're looking for a soft, warm bundle of fur and joy to share the good things in life with, please submit an adoption application for any one or more of them. They're truly amazing little ones who deserve the very best again!",

The staff here at the shelter feel that my ideal home is quiet as I am very shy when I first meet people. I would be okay with kids as long as they were respectful of my space. Recently, I learned to walk on leash so I am not fully comfortable and may pause frequently, just be patient. I am already spayed and ready to go home with you today!

Our owners had not even bothered to clean it out when they put us in there.  There was manure and other poop at least 8 inches deep.  It was horribly nasty in there. Attached to this trailer was a small, makeshift pen that was filled with poop, water and dare I say, maggots!  It was the worst situation any living being could be left in.  Some people are just so cruel, I just don't get it!\n\nThe great peeps at Lucies raced in early on the morning of July 4.  A newspaper article was written about the rescue and we were donned the name '\"The Freedom Six Pack\".\n\nI can't remember how long we suffered being in those awful conditions.  As soon as we were rescued and brought to Lucies, we each got to feel grass for the first time in our young lives.  It was the most amazing feeling ever!  The ladies that brought me teared up at our response to the grass, because it was both sad and amazing at the same time.\n\nOne of my brothers was missing a toe because of those filthy conditions.  For the first 2 weeks we were at Lucies, we all slept standing up in a pyramid style, as we had never known clean and dry conditions. \n\nI'm so glad we are here now and are doing so much better. These volunteers here really know how to love and take care of us.\n\nI can be shy at times, but believe it or not, I am extremely outgoing and I love to play.  I especially LOVE being in the water and splashing around!  I am K9 friendly and I am also leash and crate trained.\n\nWhile it's really awesome here, I would truly love to have a family of my own to play and cuddle with.  I sure hope that's you!  Thanks for visiting my page.  Hope to see you soon!\n\n*** We strive to ensure our dogs are going to a safe, loving and caring home. Phone interviews are required for all adoptions****",

When he arrived in August, it wasn't clear if he was ever going to let us love him, but over the last few months, he's come a very long way with people that he trusts. He is starting to get very tired of shelter life and we want nothing more than for him to be loved for the rest of his days in a home. Goonie is 3 years old, 54 lbs and stunningly gorgeous.

She is a lot of fun and will be a great addition to your family. She was tested for food aggression and passed but she will need a home without DOGS and CATS!!! Agatha is spayed and has her rabies vaccination. \n\nAgatha is located at the Manci Prison Program for training, she is not at our shelter. If you would like to set up a time to meet her you will need to send an email to: Christina.thomas@odrc.state.oh.us\n\nUPDATE FROM PRISON PROGRAM:\nAgatha is very loving, She is not dog aggressive, toys may be a trigger around other dogs though. She has learned most of her basic commands and will be ready for adoption within a month. \n\nFor an adoption application you can request one via richlandcountypets@yahoo.com",

He can be a little unruly at times, but he is a sweetheart who only wants to please his owner. In his previous home, he did live with other dogs but he was food aggressive with them. When we tested him here, he didn't do that great with the other dogs. We feel that if he gets some training and socializing he will be fine. Also Riggs has a very high prey drive, he can't live in a home with cats! Riggs can be very nervous at times when meeting new people. He will require multiple meets!",

            "description": "Winnie came to us as a stray from Hillsborough County Animal Services three years ago. She was adopted but the situation in that home changed as life happens and Winnie came back to us.   At 8 years old this sweet girl had eye issues which we took care of surgically and now just requires drops daily, she's a food lover so she's on a special low calorie diet and her arthritis is maintained easily by daily supplements.  Winnie is around 65lbs, 8 years old, and dog friendly. She enjoys the company of her humans and just wants to be in your lap! \nWinnie is in a foster home in the Tampa, Florida area and is ready for adoption! Interested in meeting her? Fill out an application on our website www.newlifedogrescue.com\nATTENTION:\nPlease note, all of our dogs are in foster homes. You must fill out a application before you can meet/see the dogs we have available. \nIf you see the dog on here, it is still available. If curious on updates of a dog, check out our facebook page! \nhttps://www.facebook.com/newlifedogrescue/\n\n\nAdoption Process:\nFill out an application at www.newlifedogrescue.com\nWe will do a background check and verify home ownership. If rental, we must receive a letter from the\nmanagement company or owner on their letter head approving the breed listed of the dog they are\ninquiring about. If the background check has any discrepancies or the current animals in the home are\nnot current on vaccinations we will void the application.\nWe do a home inspection. Often times we will do a meet and greet in the home with the dog and the\nfamily if they are in the Tampa Bay area and have another animal in the home.\nIf all is approved then the adopters will complete a final contract form and the donation is made at\nwhich time the health records and all shot records are turned over to the new owner.",

She is very affectionate towards people and greets everyone she knows with excitement. Roxy has worked with a trainer and a consistent foster parent so she knows basic commands and has come a long way with her manners. She loves to be with humans and take a snooze next to you while you work. She loves walks and laying in sunny spots. She goes in her crate when her foster mom leaves and does well. She is potty trained, spayed, microchipped and up to date on all of her vaccinations. She's been great with teenagers but Roxy hasn't had an opportunity to be around younger children. She should be the only pet in the household. Roxy is a wonderful, senior lady who deserves so much love and will return it immensely. She is just so sweet to have around you. Please consider adopting Roxy.\n\nI'm in a foster home, so if you are\ni\nnterested in adopting me, please fill out an online adoption application at\nhttp://colonycats.org/adoption_app.html\nto expedite the process.

WE are a high intake No Kill Shelter ran by a staff of 4 and do not always have time to answer every question asked by so many. If you are a good fit for the animal you are interested in -we will call to speak with you, If we feel you are not a good fit , we will contact you about other pets that may be a good fit for your home. Many people are losing the opportunity to adopt the animal they want because they fail to put in an application and the pet was adopted before we could answer your email. .If you have applied for an animal in our facility and have not received a response within 7 days, PLEASE call or contact us again. Though we do our best in trying to answer all emails in a timely manner, sometimes things get away from us, get lost or misplaced. It is never our intention to ignore a request about an adoptable animal in our facility.\n\nSandy Brown, Director, PAW Animal Shelter\n\n319-372-2274",

He wants nothing more than to take walks, go for car rides, snuggle on the couch and stare lovingly into your eyes! Deuce loves to play and gets super excited when the toys come out each day. He loves tug-of-war and chasing after toys (but really just uses them as a way to spend more time with his human). He is a fast learner and in just a couple days picked up a number of commands and tricks including sit, down, leave it, 'gimme five' and play dead. Otherwise, he's content to just veg out and be a very loyal and loving companion. Deuce is looking for a one or two-person living situation (possibly with another dog) in a low-traffic home or apartment who can provide consistent walks or playtime (bonus points if there's a backyard). If you're someone with a little patience looking for a big chunk of love, look no further... Deuce is the dog for you!",

            "description": "We cover Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Wisconsin and transportation is available for adoptions within those states. Stitch is currently located in KS.\nStitch is a very loving and sweet dog when you get to know him. When he first came to me he had major trust issues and we dealt with some resource guarding as well. He also has some food allergies. His food and his anxiety has calmed way down and now all of his fur has grown back in. Over the past two months Stitch has turned into a totally different dog, he is so sweet and wants to just sit down and cuddle. He is very driven by positive reinforcement and he really does try to please. One thing to note is Stitch is very energetic and will run circles through the house if you let him, he takes a stern and confident leader to guide and direct him. He is responsive to training and I will make him sit before I pet him and before I open the doors to let him in or out. He just needs a routine, I want him to go to someone who is able to work with him, you will need to be patient and confident in yourself with a large dog. I've introduced Stitch to a few friends who are over frequently and he is very friendly he just likes to jump, he just needs redirected to sit and he will calm down. I would take introductions to new people slow with him until he is familiar with them. Stitch has been around a smaller cocker spaniel a few time without any issues but I wouldn't trust him unsupervised with any dog. Stitch and my intact male intact Rottweiler don't get along that well do to dominance issues. Stitch would be better off with a single family preferably with no kids or animals and plenty of room to run. Also all gates must have a keeper because he's very smart and knows how to open gates lol.",

I am a pretty energetic girl who loves to play, so a fenced in yard would be amazing; it needs to be a privacy fence though because I can jump those shorter chain-link fences. I can be vocal at times when I get really excited, so no apartment life for me. I am good with other dogs and cats, but would also do great as your one and only furry family member. I do well with kids, but I do love to give hugs, so I could knock over some of the tinier humans. I am a super smart girl, so I am already house and kennel trained. I am currently learning basic obedience commands and how to walk properly on a leash, but it shouldn't take me long since I am so smart. Let\u2019s get started on our adventures together and you can join me, Rowan, down the river of love! \n\nI am currently enrolled in the Pups 4 Parole training program, learning all of the things I need to know to make me a great family member. I need someone willing to keep up my training so that I don't forget everything I am learning.\n\n\nMy adoption fee is $150 and includes my spay/neuter, vaccinations, wellness exam, heartworm test, and microchip! If you're interested in meeting/adopting me, please visit www.rescueonespringfield.com/our-adoption-process/adoption-application/ and fill out the form! We do adopt out of state with vet references and video home check. *Adopter is responsible for coming to get the dog and returning the dog if the adoption does not work out* \n\nDon't forget to LIKE us on Facebook!-www.facebook.com/rescueonespringfield\n\n*Remember, dogs are pack animals. Because of this, Rescue One does not adopt to outdoor-only homes. Pets are family and are not disposable.  Please make sure that you are 100% committed to a pet before considering adding one to your home.",

His ideal home would work from home or have short days away from the house. He currently is taking a medication to calm his anxiousness.\n\nHousebroken: Yes\n\nEnergy Level: Very High\n\nReaction to New People: Friendly\n\nKid Friendly: Unknown but should not live with children under 16 as he likes to jump on people and can be very mouthy.\n\nTraining: Knows sit, shake, lay down, will come when called (most of the time). Working on wait and leave it.\n\nGrooming Needs: Blaze has a standard husky coat which will require frequent brushing. We are working on trust right now, as he does not enjoy being brushed on the hind quarters.\n\nFence: He would do fine with a fenced yard or a tie-out.\n\nSolo or Siblings: He would do well as an only dog or with siblings that are willing to put him in his place. An active/young dog would make a great match for him.\n\nHi I'm Blaze! I was found wandering the streets so no one really knows my background. One thing is for sure, I didn't have too many rules or boundaries in my past so I'm kind of a big puppy. But it's ok! I'm working with a trainer to curb my enthusiasm to a gentle roar. I also get to go to daycare a few times a week to keep up with my socialization. I have to be reminded now and again that other pups don't like it when I...er....umm...jump on them, but I'm a work in progress! But my brain and body run fast so I'm looking for a partner in crime that will work me both physically and mentally. If you have husky experience and love to bikejor, skijor, snowshoe, hike, run marathons, I would love to meet you! These things all sound excellent to me! With my busy husky brain I need a mental work out too- obedience work, puzzle games, hide and seek, fetch, maybe even agility-let's get creative together.\nSince I'm still learning how to dog, I would prefer a home with older kids or no kids, as I'm a bit mouthy when I play. I do good with redirection and ignoring when I'm playing keep-away or having a husky tantrum. Beware-I'm a shoe stealer and I will prance around with my find hoping to engage you in a game of \"Catch the Naughty Husky. \nSo if you are looking for a fuzzy buddy and willing to put the work in to mold this big ol' puppy into something nice to have dinner with, I'm your boy! I would love to find an active, strong leader hooman that wants to show me the ropes and help me be the best boy I can be. Is it you? Smash that button below to apply to adopt me. I'm so excited to become your bestest friend.\n\nAdoption Fee: $400\n\nAll dogs coming into Adopt a Husky Minnesota receive care tailored to their needs, including: Nose-to-tail exam with a partner veterinarian, Vaccinations (Rabies, Distemper, Bordetella), 4DX test to check for heartworm or tick exposure, Fecal Analysis, Heartworm and Flea/Tick Preventative, Spay/Neuter prior to adoption, Microchip, and are evaluated for temperament and trainability.",

He has some mobility issues and a large abscess. The pound is no place for a senior to rest their head. Lucky for Herman, one of our loving foster families stepped up for him and he got his freedom ride on September 23rd, 2020.\n\nABOUT HERMAN\n\nHerman was inquisitive about his new surroundings, but has settled in quickly. He has some skin issues likely due to poor diet and living outdoors, but with some quality food and TLC, he will soon shine like a new penny. As an experienced gentleman, he has some mobility issues on his hind legs, but he is on joint supplements to help give him some strength. As such, he is also a very calm guy who enjoys sunbathing and sleeping in a comfy spot. You can walk into his room and he won't even move. He is a quiet soul who takes life slowly and has no complaints. He enjoys being petted and will freely give kisses to whomever lets him. Herman is being quarantined to monitor for signs of an upper respiratory infection, but will eventually get to enjoy the company of other dogs soon. In the mean time, he is catching up on his sleep, love, and enjoys being treated like a king in his golden years.\n\n*Please check back for updates on this old man*\n\nOur adoption fee is $300. All dogs are current on vaccinations, spayed or neutered, micro-chipped, on heartworm prevention, and are fed top of the line grain-free food.www.savingpitbulls.org",

This dog is 8 to 9 years old, weighs 90 pounds and her adoption fee is $200.\n\nSuri came to us in August of 2012. She was a happy dog that loved to have her ears scratched ; she was born in animal control in Del Rio, where she was rescued. For three years she went to adoptions, but no one selected her. She was our mascot who ran all over the property with her friends. She was our little thief. She used to take all our tools, other dogs toys and just about anything she could get her hands on. She would take them and put everything in a pile by her favorite tree. Never destroyed anything.\n\nWe were excited when she finally found a home after being with us for 3 years. She has been with a family until recently. Due to Covid 19 they could no longer afford to care for a senior dog. She was returned to the shelter extremely obese. We are working on trimming her down. She needs a family where she will get exercise and the proper amount of food.",

This dog is approximately 7 years old, 14.2 pounds and the adoption fee is $250. This dog does have heartworms and will go out on a slow treat. You can apply at www.adoggie4you.org.\n\nMy name is Watson. Waldo, Walton and Watson were all found together in a subdivision where they were reportedly dumped. The three dogs were very bonded when they came in, but they are slowly becoming independent. They love all other dogs and are really starting to play with new people they meet. Everyone loves Watson, who we suspect is the daddy of the group. He is fearless. Follows people everywhere and just wants to be loved. He will make an excellent dog for a senior citizen.",

He walks well on a leash, and would do great with a family that likes to lounge around with him, hang out in the backyard and go for daily walks. \n\nSunny does well with female dogs and could do okay with a laid back male. Proper introductions are always recommended. He is not tested with cats. Since he can be nervous at times, he is not an apartment dog. He would do best in a freestanding home, or a small and quiet condo/townhome. \n\nSunny is UTD on shots, neutered and microchipped. His adoption. fee is $400.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Hi, my name is Teddy.\n\nI am a sweet, goofy boy who likes to hang out and observe the world around me. I look like an old man, but I'm believed to be around 5 or 6 years old.\n\nI'm on the larger size at around 90 lbs, so it's probably best I go to a home with no young children. I get the zoomies and because I'm partially blind I might knock the little ones over. I'm also scared of loud noises, so I probably wouldn't be happy with little kids since they tend to be loud at times. Another thing I don't like is cats. I do like to chase them, though! I'm fine with all dogs.\n\nWhen you leave it's probably best I'm crated. I have an incredible sniffer and I'm smart, so I'll try to open food containers and steal snacks! And oooh do I love snacks! I'm a very food motivated boy, that's for sure. I also really enjoy scratches, naps and prancing around the back yard with my fur sister.\n\nSpeaking of outside. I'm mostly house trained, but I won't tell you when I need to go out..so I may have an accident here or there. My foster family has figured out a schedule for me, which works quite well, so I rarely have accidents.\n\nI do have some medical needs, but they are managed with proper medication. My foster family doesn't know my back story, but it's thought that there may have been a head injury at one point. As a result, I am blind in one eye and occasionally have seizures. The seizure meds I am on right now appear to be working pretty well, though! The other medicine I need is eye drops. They help keep the pressure down, so I remain pain free. Sounds complicated, but don't worry, I take my meds like a champ, especially when mom takes a small piece of tortilla, adds a little peanut butter and creates a peanut butter taco! So delic!\n\nI am also unfortunately heartworm positive. Given my seizure history, my rescue family thinks it will be best for me to be treated with the slow kill method. This method uses monthly heartworm prevention, which the rescue will provide, to kill the worms. It will take awhile to be completely worm free, but for my overall health and well-being it's likely the better option.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting me, please reach out to your adoption coordinator. If you do not have an adoption coordinator, please fill out an adoption application on our website.\n\nhttps://www.freedomgermanshepherdrescue.org\n\nI am being fostered near Raleigh. 2/1/21 11:41 AM",

Our veterinary partner estimates that Molly is 1.5 years old at the time of intake in October 2020. Molly is good with people of all ages, other dogs and cats. This sweet girl was in horrific condition when we rescued her, but she has received the medical care she required for her painful skin infection and she is now ready to go! Molly is a bit unsure of what's going on in her life, and she needs to be showered with love and kisses and be shown that life can be good.\nMolly is a bashful, easy dog who looks to her foster family for reassurance on how to be a dog. She loves to snuggle and she loves cheese, peanut butter and vanilla wafers! Molly is very responsive to treats and rewards. She is house, leash, and crate trained. Molly's safe place is her crate and she insists that other dogs respect her place. Molly is stressed by loud noises and cars and must be leashed at all times.\nIf you can give Molly the love and patience she needs to trust that her life can be happy, please apply online to adopt Molly (SC) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

Thanks!\n\nBailey is a handsome fellow. He loves to play and can be quite the goofball! A fenced yard would be best for him as he loves playing ball (loves soccer balls!) and running around. Bailey is currently working on his fear and alertness of strangers and will need a family that is committed and patient while he continues to learn how to react to strangers appropriately. He is very intelligent, food motivated and so very eager to learn! His new family will need to have experience with or a willing and interest to work with a trainer.t! He's an amazing dog that is looking for the right family to provide him the patience, understanding, dedication and love to help him overcome his fear of strangers and to continue the appropriate training he needs to do so. \nDue to his needs and playfulness, he will need a home without young children (ages 15 and up may be okay), no cats and no apartments please. He has a history of doing well romping around with other dogs so another dog companion may be okay pending a meet and greet.\n\nBailey is currently hanging out at the shelter while waiting for a foster home. See instructions below on how to send in an application to come meet him. \n\nTo meet Bailey, send an application (found here) http://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/AnimalShelter/Dog%20Adoption%20Questionnaire_Fillable.pdf to animalcare@seattle.gov - thanks!",

            "description": "Ivory is a 1 year old Chorkie/chin/maltese mix. His adoption fee is $400. He weighs just over 10 pounds. \n\nIvory is a live wire :) He has a ton of energy and wants to be involved in everything. He is always finding something to keep him entertained (even if it is not doggie approved) and loves to play with the other dogs. He is very skittish. He will need a fenced in backyard and a home without young kids. He would also prefer other dogs in the home. He likes dogs more than he likes people :) he will learn though. He has a big bark and is a great guard dog at 10 pounds...hehe.\n\nHis hair is like that of a chihuahua so he is not hypoallergenic. He also marks in the house. Now that he is fixed it should slow down some.\n\nHis brother is Ebony and they are an amazing pair if someone is looking to adopt 2 dogs.",

            "description": "When Roy came to the shelter he was understandably pretty scared, he had just lost his family due to a housing issue, and he wasn't very trusting of all of the new people at the shelter. We watched Roy come out of his shell little by little, and pretty soon he had made friends with the staff and some volunteers. Roy's previous owners said that he loves playing with toys, both tennis balls and squeaky toys, and he loves car rides, playing in the water, running and laying on the couch. We have introduced Roy into our playgroups and he is very playful with the right personality dog. He likes to play chase, but he gets a little scared if things get rough and rowdy. Roy seems to be housetrained and after some initial excited pulling, he walks well on the leash. Since he loves his people so much he can get a little stressed when they leave, so an ideal home would have someone home a lot, or someone who is willing to show him that it's not so terrible to be home alone. We are recommending that Roy go to an adult only home-even though he has been okay with children in the past, his fearful behavior is probably better suited to adults. We are pretty sure you will find Roy as charming as we do! Let's chat and see if Roy is right for your home! Check out my photos/videos!",

I came all the way here from Texas looking for a recliner chair to steal, a couch works too,  and full disclosure I'm kind of a bed hog!   My friends at the shelter keep asking me why my head tilts so much but honestly I don't remember??  I may have had an old injury that caused that and my deafness but know one really knows, what I do know is that I think its one of my cutest attributes.  If you are my new family I will need some help with a few things, I am a very loyal friend and I prefer to be introduced to new people very slowly, I'd maybe even like to admire my new potential friends from a distance a few times before we hang out.   I just want to make sure they aren't going to hurt either one of us before I allow them access to kissable face!  I love a good brisk walk but sometimes I get a little worked out with all the change in my environment, remember I need patience because I can't hear anything so my first reaction is to, well react and I bark.   My foster Mom and I are working on that but you and I will need some practice to get in the groove.  My foster Mom giggles constantly at my goofy antics and she keeps telling me there is someone out there that will love my companionship and will give me the quiet lifestyle she knows I need and so much deserve!!",

This pet is neutered, up to date on all age-appropriate vaccinations and preventatives, heart-worm negative, and micro-chipped!\nHero is house trained and leash trained. He is a good car rider and knows basic commands. \n\nHe is good with dogs. His foster home has many dogs ranges in sizes from extra small to large and he has not had any issues with any of them. He is also very patient and good with kids!\n\nHero is a good dog and will follow you around all day. He gets upset if hes not by your side and will cry. He has to take to eyedrops everyday and he is not a fan so he can be a bit difficult. We were told he is scared of thunder but have not had him long enough to see if it's destructive or if he just hides. He is potty trained and will let you know when he needs to go. He sleeps a lot but can also be playful if you let him know it's okay. \n\n\nYou can apply to meet/adopt this pet at www.muttmisfits.com/adoption-application. \n\n",

He bounces with happiness and enjoys being with people. He\u2019d jump up when he wanted a treat or attention but learned that sitting down worked much better. I\u2019d say, \u201cLook at me,\u201d hold up a treat, and then tell him to sit, and he got the idea pretty quickly. \n\nSoon, he was looking at me and sitting on his own to let me know when he wanted a treat. He was proud of himself and is a smart dog. I bet with some patience and a pocket full of treats, Jimbo can learn lots of new skills!\n\nIf you are interested in fostering, adopting, or rescuing Jimbo, call 706-613-3540 to discuss options with staff.\n\nYou can read more about this dog and check out additional photos here: https://athenspets.net/Adoptables/54441-jimbo/ OR check out our urgent dogs (http://tinyurl.com/Athenspets-FB-URGENT-Dogs) on Facebook!\n\nThis dog is currently at Athens-Clarke County Animal Control, located at 125 Buddy Christian Way, Athens, GA.

She is a very friendly girl but dislikes children, so must be in an adults only home. Also, she is very guarded upon first meeting you and will need to get to know you or have a trainer. After originally thinking she was a St. Bernard mix, we have received input from people who have such dogs that she is a Livestock Guard Dog breed, possibly a Caucasian Ovchartka. She is a very special poochie who can only go home to people who understand this type of doggie.",

She has hip dysplasia and takes medication once a day to manage it. \n\nTEMPERAMENT: Alaska is nervous around other dogs and animals. Loud noises can startle her and it takes some time for her to warm up to new people. \n\nPERSONALITY: Alaska is a sweet girl who knows many tricks, such as high five, shake a paw, and sit. As soon as she becomes familiar with her new surroundings her true colors shine. She does enjoy being outside and napping in the warm sun,\n\nIDEAL HOME: Alaska would thrive in a quite home with someone who is experienced with nervous dogs. A daily walk would be great but not an extremely active household. A fenced yard would be ideal. \n\nIf you would like to meet Alaska, please fill in an adoption application.\n\nPlease note: We apologize for being unable to respond to inquiries about our dogs without an adoption application.\n",

            "description": "Hank is currently in Georgia at a trainer and this is her report: Hank is improving daily. He really is a good boy. He has an interesting personality where he is very soft and unconfident at first in a new situation (ie, new foster home), but warms up within a few days and needs a firm (but loving and kind) handler that will remind him of the rules! A strong pack leader makes him feel safe! Although he is initially very excited when he gets out of the kennel (we are working on not rushing through doorways!) he does know how to heel, sit, down, stay, come... but needs to be reminded, especially the first few minutes he is out. If he thinks he can get away with something (i.e. pulling on the leash) he will! He can be quite strong when excited - or if he spooks - and needs someone who is fit enough to not let him ever pull away and let him think that's an option! ) He is treat-motivated, and does take them politely. He tolerates some dogs, but will react to others. On leash, while we are working him, he is fairly easy to re-direct. He notices cats, chickens, horses, etc., but will avert eye-contact and not even look at them if told to leave it. (He is not at the point to get those same results off-leash yet!) He has a great coat, that stays amazingly shiny and clean - even after playing on the farm! No skin issues. He doesn't destroy blankets or toys, and keeps his denning area clean. I believe he did well with his housetraining at the previous foster home. He will be a very nice dog for someone willing to put in a little effort to establish rules and be consistent! Hank is approximately two years old. All information about the rescue and adoption can be found at ewenityfarmsbch.com.",

            "description": "Panda girl!!  This sweet, sweet gal was found as a stray walking down the street with a gashing wound on her head.  Panda ended up at the county shelter with a lot of medical concerns.  When we were made aware of Panda, we went and removed her from the shelter.  Panda initially had issues with balance and her hind legs would slip from under her.  She also had an obviously head tilt to the right.  Panda had to have staples in her head to close the wound and she had a lot of smaller wounds throughout her body.  What happened to Panda?  How was she in this shape?  We will never know...what we do know is that she has had a lot of litters and her prior life was not the best.  She slept a lot and was a bit nervous around people.   After a slew of tests at the vet - both x-rays and neurological - we were relieved that Panda had no  obvious trauma to her body, meaning no broken bones or lingering head trauma.   What was assumed is her balance issues and head tilt was most likely from a severe inner ear infection.  For the last few months, Panda has been in a very stable, quiet and loving foster home and her daily progress is heartwarming.  She takes multiple walks a day and although she has a cute waddle, her endurance and balance is near perfect.   She jumps up on her foster dad's bed, she loves to sun herself outside and her daily walks have helped her become stronger.  We have not tested Panda with dogs as we have been focused on allowing her to get well and enjoy the attention of being pampered.  We think Panda is about five years old.  She will make a very loyal and grateful companion.  If you think you can give Panda her best life ($200 donation), please take a moment to fill out an application.  An application is a must and once received, we will contact you within 72 hours.  https://www.povertyspets.org/adoption-form.  Thank you.",

Here's what his former owner told us about him: - He was primarily an indoor pet in that household and was housebroken - He has done well with children as young as one year old - He has been through basic obedience training and knows sit, shake, speak and wait - He was trusted to be loose in the house when left home alone When meeting other dogs in PACC playgroup, Tiberius preferred to keep to himself and asked for space from the other dogs when needed.

            "description": "Meet Lacey! This beautiful hound mix girl is approximately a year old and about 45 pounds. She is super sweet but shy at first. She MUST have another confident and playful dog in her forever home as she thrives with a dog buddy to play with and learn from. She also must have a decent sized fenced in back yard because she loves to run and play! She cannot go to a home with young kids or super social teens as loud noises and new situations are scary for her. Her adopter must be patient and keep slowly working to build her confidence as her foster mama is doing. We know Lacey will be a wonderful family member with the right loving and patient family. She loves to cuddle and give kisses!\n\nLacey is spayed, up to date on vaccines, and microchipped. Her adoption donation is only $250! As with all puppies adopted through Maxx & Me, her adopter will need to commit to continue working with a positive reinforcement trainer of their choice to help her continue to become a well mannered and confident girl.\n\nTo meet any of our dogs please fill out an application on www.maxxandme.org.\n\nMaxx & Me is an all volunteer, all foster home rescue and do not have a shelter. Please allow at least 48 hours for applications to be processed (missing information may slow the process, so please take your time and be thoughtful in your answers). All dogs posted are available (so no need to ask). We place dogs based on best home for each dog and not order of applications received. Email us at maxxandmerescue@gmail.com for updates and questions. Thank you for choosing rescue.",

            "description": "In memory of Josephine Catanese\nGrandma Great's Special Transport\nA transport in memory of Josephine Catanese, better known as Gram. A special mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, sister, aunt, cousin, and friend. Gram's life centered around her family. She loved us, listened to us, taught us, encouraged us, advised us, and was always there for us. Gram had many pets through the years from fish and birds to cats and dogs. Most of which were acquired by her family and brought to her home where they stayed and never looked back. All of these animals weren't just animals, they became a part of her family. She even cared for the stray cats in her neighborhood, making a cat house with heating pads, plenty of canned and dry food, water, and medicine if needed. She exemplified love and kindness every day of her life. This transport in honor of our Gram is a continuation of her love and kindness of all animals.\n\nJess was born around October 15, 2016, and weighs about 25 pounds. Jess and 14 other dogs were surrendered to a southern high kill shelter when their elderly owner with dementia was taken to the hospital. Most of the dogs appear to be a Jack Russel Mix of some sort. A few of them may have some Border Collie mixed in and some have Basset Hound features. They arrived at the shelter covered in fleas and malnourished. These dogs are a touch shy at first but quickly melt into sweet cuddly wiggle butts! They are all thriving now and ready to find incredible homes where they will be cherished and adored. You may have some house training work to do as it's likely it didn't matter much where they went to the bathroom in their previous home but they will be worth the extra effort! Jess appears to be, perhaps, part Beagle. She is absolutely adorable and when she runs she....leaps with all four legs straight out in front and behind. It must be a breed trait, but haven't figured out what before, not sure I've ever seen a dog run like this - very athletic little thing! We will be looking for a home with another dog in it for Jess as she truly seeks out and is comforted by canine companions.\n\nThe Adoption Fee for this dog is $500.00\nAdoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a 'complete' pet. We accept CASH or Visa/Mastercard ONLY.\n\nJoyful Rescues has no funding except for our adoption fees and miscellaneous donations. Pet care and vet bills are expensive - you must be ready to take on this financial (as well as emotional) responsibility. YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 25 YEARS OF AGE TO ADOPT A DOG FROM JOYFUL RESCUES\n\nWe keep our pet list as up-to-date as possible. As soon as a pet is adopted, it is removed from the list. If a pet is still showing, it is still available for adoption.\n\nCan't Adopt Me? SPONSOR ME\nLook for the Link 'Special Instructions to Seller' if you want to note a particular pet\nBefore you seek to adopt a pet from Joyful Rescues, please read our Pet Adoption page http://www.joyfulrescues.org/pet_adoption.html.\n\nOnline Application",

In the shelter, Tank is a little scared of new experiences, but he does eventually warm up once he realized everything is safe. He loves our staff here though, and enjoys spending time in the yard with them or on walks. We are guessing that this silly boy will also have no problem cozying right up on the couch in a new home as he takes on a new role of couch potato. He is waiting for someone to come take him to his forever home where he can spend his days soaking up the sun and laying on the comfy spaces provided for him in a warm, safe home.

            "description": "Ellie is a pretty 55 lb, 2 yr old Pitbull female. She has passed the cat test but would take a structured introduction to ensure everybody likes everybody. Miss Ellie is the sweetest girl despite her rough beginning to life. She is what we would consider a Velcro dog. Ellie would prefer to be next to her owner as much as possible! She is great with kids and cats, but dog selective. She would do best as the only dog in the home. Ellie is house broken as long as she is let outside after meals and drinks! Ellie walks great on a leash. She does not pull, but she may try to walk in front of you instead of next to you. Keeping her on a short leash to your side solves this issue. Ellie is a big snuggle bug especially after a nice walk! She will prefer sleeping with you at night! Ellies manners need to be fine-tuned. She does jump up on you wanting to be pet, but with persistence this habit can be broken. Ellie knows her name and has a great recall, except if there is a squirrel around! Overall, she is a beautiful, sweet, highly intelligent pup who simply wants and needs to be loved. \n\nThe adoption fee is $300 and covers age appropriate vaccines, a microchip, and a spay/neuter.\n\n Applications are typically worked in time stamp order based on date/time of submission. If you have other dogs in your home, they must all meet the potential adoptee. It may save you a trip to bring them with you when you visit, if you are certain you want to adopt a new family member. \n\n*****We are currently operating by appointment only during the social distancing stage of quarantine. If you want to meet this pet, or are interested in adopting, please submit an inquiry or email to email@townandcountryhumanesociety.org.\n\nSomeone from the rescue will contact you and/or your family and determine, on a broad level, whether you might be a fit for the animal. If so, they will provide instructions for completing the application. Your application will be reviewed and you will be contacted to set up a time to meet at the shelter or the foster home. The introduction between you and the pet will be supervised by one of the dog counselors or the foster. If all goes well, you can adopt during the same visit.\n\nPlease be sure to follow us on Facebook to learn more about Town and Country Humane Society and our mission.",

I REALLY need a HIGH fenced back yard so I can run around and get rid of all my energy, but stay contained at the same time. I am kinda famous as an escape artist and will try to dig or climb my way out of any enclosure. I am friendly and get along with dogs and kids, but not cats. I am mostly housetrained. It would be best for everyone if you are familiar with my breed so you know what to expect if you want to adopt me.

            "description": "Smile-y Malazan is looking for an extra special home. She is around 8 months old and we think she is a Lab mix. Her mama Fantasy is on the smaller side at only 30 lbs but we aren't sure what dad's mix is or how she will get. Malazan is an absolute love but needs a family who will help her build confidence in the world and also someone to set consistent boundaries. She needs slow but consistent introductions to everything new and then may need some downtime if she is feeling overwhelmed. She needs time to decompress in new households. She would do best in a home with no children or older children who would understand that she can need space. She is crate trained and mostly house trained but needs a routine. Malazan loves to play and wrestle with her foster dog brother but would do best with a well trained dog who tolerates little puppy teeth. She is leash trained but can be easily startled and is still working by on gaining confidence on leash. Malazan would do best in a home with dog experience (no first time dog owners) and with a confident dog to help show her the way. Malazan is looking for a family that understands the time, patience, and energy needed to raise a young pup. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting Malazan, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs. Thank you for rescuing.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue. Please take a moment and go to www.labsandmore.org and click on Adopt to complete our online dog adoption application.

Rescue is hard because we see more heart-wrenching stories than the average person. I'm Nala's foster and took her directly from her wonderful family who made the hard decision to give her up because of a difficult circumstance they could not control. Most of the time rescue doesn't see the people behind the dog. With Nala, I did. I saw the love they had for her, I saw the tears they shed for her, I listened to the details about her personality they struggled to say because of the hard reality they faced of having her leave. Fostering has been the single commitment to find my dog a wonderful forever home, but in Nala's case, I am also being trusted by her family to find a forever home as wonderful as the one she came from. It's a responsibility I am taking very seriously.\n\nNala is a big sweetie who enjoys cuddling on the couch, eating, and having soft toys thrown for her retrieval. That's her softer side, on her naughty side, is nosing through bathroom trash and eating the paper products a trash can contains, and counter surfing. Maybe this eating obsession stems from the gut issue she is currently being treated for. We are working with our veterinarian to get her the proper diagnosis. Once thoroughly diagnosed, she will be available to go to her new home with instructions on how to keep her irritable gut happy and quiet. At the moment she is being fed a prescription diet and taking a few medications to manage it. I am still working with my vet to determine the cause of her symptoms, so it could be a short term issue or a lifelong issue that is managed. Nala also has an underactive thyroid that is remedied by a morning & evening thyroid replacement medication. It's not an expensive medicine, but one she will need everyday, twice a day, for the rest of her life. Her thyroid level will need to be monitored by a blood test by your veterinarian. Once medically cleared, she will need to be spayed; so adopting Nala isn't going to be quick, there is still work to be done to have her healthy & ready to be part of the family. A commitment GSRA stands by.\n\nAs for physical activity, Nala will take as many walks as you want to go on. She walks nicely on leash, but is easily distracted by a squirrel, so you'll want to have a secure collar & leash she can't run out of. Once the walking is done, she likes to sit in the backyard to watch birds & squirrels, and will be still as a statue doing it.\n\nNo doubt she is a fantastic riding companion. Anywhere you want to go, she's all in.\n\nAnd when the day is coming to a close, she will want to share your couch. A good blanket and a pillow are the items she likes to ease her into the evening. And when you are ready to share the couch, she will politely scoot over to make room. As for her bedtime, she likes a bed of her own, but close by to you. She will sleep soundly all night, but is ready for the day the minute the alarm goes off.\nNo doubt she is a fantastic riding companion.

She\u2019s fairly mellow in a home and does great with kids. Bridgette is house trained and also crate trained. She\u2019s deaf and needs to be the only dog in the home. She\u2019s not a fan of canine friends. Bridgette enjoys snuggling with her peeps and is looking for a family where she can be queen canine. Her adoption fee is $350 and she\u2019s in foster in Longmont. You can apply for Bridgette at https://milehighcanine.org/forms-and-applications/mhcr-adoption-application/.",

            "description": "Since TAGS is a smaller volunteer program, we are limited to facilitating adoptions only within Durham Region in Ontario. We encourage those applicants who apply out of area to check your local shelters and rescue programs. We are always happy to refer you to a program in your area.\n\nGinger is an approximate one year old beagle-basset-hound mix, and weighs just over 30 lbs.  She is exceptionally lovable, high energy and very playful.  After a day of walks and play, she loves nothing more than to cuddle.  She sleeps quietly in her crate with her fosters in the same room.\n\nGinger walks well on a gentle leader (halti) and is obedient to basic on-leash commands.  She walks well to heel but likes nothing more than to be at the end of her six-foot leash, on command, when she can follow scents.  She is definitely a \u2018sniffing\u2019 dog and when allowed a loose leash, walks with her nose to the ground.  She will be very happy with an active family who enjoy outdoor activities.  She loves walks, running unleashed and playing ball.  She does not appear to be apprehensive of water and in fact may be a \u2018swimmer\u2019.  \n\nShe enjoys spending time with her fosters\u2019 young grandchildren (under 10).  Ginger should ideally go to a home with no cats.  While not aggressive, she is overly playful and wants to play \u2018chase\u2019.\n\nGinger needs ongoing socialization with other dogs.  There is no aggression, and she enjoys meeting dogs on her walks, it\u2019s just that her enthusiasm with other dogs off-leash can be overwhelming. \n\nIn her fosters\u2019 home, she continues to have basic commands reinforced and is eager to obey.  It will be important for this to continue in her new home.  Because of the lack of stability and consistency Ginger has experienced in her short life she suffers from separation anxiety, which is why a home where someone works from home or is typically home during the day would be ideal.  However, this has been improving with the help of her fosters, and Ginger has all the qualities to become a wonderful furry family member.  What she needs is a forever home so she may establish security and feel loved.  \n\n\n\t",

She is a 5 year old American Bully.  \n\n With that being said let me tell you what I do know about Miss Patty ? \nShe is the total package ? \n\n   She is a total love bug ?. She loves being with her people, although she does get excited in large crowds. Only because she thinks everybody needs to focus on her and only her ? ? \nShe does like to exert her dominance. But with a forceful controlled voice she listens.  She will need an experienced owner.  \n\n  She loves car ? rides and enjoys her walks ? very much. She is good with kids but 8 years and up would be preferred due to her strength and dominance.  She still has a lot to be taught but she is willing to learn, she just needs your patience. She does take to men faster than women but she does love both ?? She is good with big dogs, but no small dogs or cats and preferably male dog in the home only. She is a absolutely must meet American Bully ??\n\nTo put in a application for\nMiss Patty ??  please go to www.zoeshouserescue.com\n\nHer adoption donation is $350",

            "description": "Chico Cay is a 7 Month pup and is 27lbs and arrived here in Florida from BVI the night of July 4th. He is a firework and a wonderful active pup! He is Shy and Independent. He likes to watch from a distance before he gets involved (but who does not) and is crate and house trained. He knows some basic commands and loves to go on walks! He loves to give kisses and hugs on his own terms. Chico Cay loves treats and chew toys. He does take his time to eat his food but that is ok, he is being sure he can digest properly-LOL. He is a brave boy who is growing out of his shell daily and learning about the new world around him. He has gotten comfortable in his foster home with his foster dog siblings and even comfortable at the neighbor's house and their pets which he visits often. As with all puppies he needs guidance and training to learn the world and proper manners. He would benefit from a puppy training class, just like all kids he needs school and socialization. Chico Cay would love a home with a fenced in yard so he can run and play. Chico Cay wishes for a furever home of his own with a family preferably with mid-teen or older kids as he is still learning his puppy manners and no condo's as he loves his yard play time. He would be great in a home with dogs already or as a single dog with training. Come and meet Chico Cay today! He will re-pay you with a lifetime of love and snuggles!\nDOB: 3/01/2020 Adoption fee for this pup is $175 and includes DHPP vaccination heartworm testing spay/neuter surgery wellness vet visit one month pet insurance deworming and microchip. All animals are examined by a veterinarian. Please fill out our application at https://gkarma.wufoo.com/forms/good-karma-pet-rescue-dog-adoption-screening/ if you would like to adopt or meet this puppy and we will be in touch right away!",

I am ready to fall in love and be your new best friend. I would do best in a home with a fenced in yard, where I can play and sings songs (you know...bark). I am a little picky with other dogs so I really need proper introductions. I have some special talents too! I have a real curiosity for the world so I have learned how to climb a fence, so please be sure you have plenty of time for fun and exercise as I love to be on the go! They estimate that I was born in late 2019. I weigh about 40 pounds. \n\nSince I am still a young guy, I could use some obedience training which will help me learn to be an obedient pup! And NO cats please, I really don't like those! \n\nCome and meet me at our Palm City location.\n\nAdopt Don't Shop\n\nPlease call the Palm City Ranch at 561-972-1194 to make an appointment to meet this special girl.",

Puerto Rico is experiencing an animal welfare crisis which was compounded by Hurricane Maria and the continuous earthquakes experienced in the southern part of the island. She is current on shots, spayed, and microchipped. She relates well with other dogs but is initially shy with humans. Blanqui is afraid of thunderstorms. She enjoys playing with other dogs with whom she is familiar. Blanqui weighs 24 pounds.\n\nAs with all of our rescues, we require a fenced-in yard, and a home visit prior to adoption. A fenced-in-yard is required, no exception. On the day of the agreed-upon date for the home visit, we will bring Blanqui with us. We will be wearing a mask and hand gloves to protect you as well as ourselves. The meeting will take place in your backyard. We only accept two applications per dog. We evaluate both applicants prior to determining who in our opinion is the best fit. If interested please complete and submit the dog adoption application available on this site.",

Eddie is part of a bonded pair and will be adopted with his pal, Herman. \n <p>Dogs over 6 months are tested for heartworms and treated if positive. Any other health problems are treated. Dogs are kept on heartworm and flea/tick preventatives. All dogs are already spayed or neutered, de-wormed, current on vaccinations, and microchipped. They typically share a kennel with another dog (depending on size and temperament), and usually go outside several times a day with a play group. </p>\n<p>Our dog adoption fee is $125-175.

            "description": "Ginger is approx 3 yrs old and 50#. She was spayed on 11/30 and ready to leave for a forever home before Christmas!\nMeet the elusive Ginger! When you first greet her in the kennel you feel like you are meeting Cujo! Take her out and she is a bouncy, lovable girl! One of our volunteers recently took her home for the night and saw her true side.  Ginger was playful, loving and full of personality. This shows us how different dogs can be out of the shelter environment. Ginger is still waiting for her forever family. She would do best with older children, NO CATS OR OTHER DOGS!!  If you can provide Ginger with a loving home please email below. \n\nFOR ADOPTERS: please contact Kelly, our Adoption Coordinator, with any questions at taylorcodogs@gmail.com or inquire directly via Petfinder. There is a link to our online ADOPTION APPLICATION on our Petfinder home page. You may also request an application via email. Paper copies are available at our shelter.\nWe always recommend a meet and greet with our dogs available for adoption. We are not able to assess dogs with cats since we are set up for dog intakes only. If you have cats, we advise a proper introduction while keeping the dog on leash in your home.\nWe are volunteer-based, so please be patient with our response time.\n\nFOR RESCUES: Taylor County is rescue friendly! If you are a rescue, please contact our Rescue Coordinator, Diana, at deed1123@aol.com\n\nDONATIONS: We are always in need of donations to help care for our dogs. We feed IAMS Adult Mini Chunks (green bag) and IAMS Smart Puppy. If you can assist financially, please mail a check payable to Taylor County Humane Society at PO Box 243, Grafton WV 26354 or visit our website to donate via PayPal. http://www.tchswv.com/donations/",

Unfortunately the lady can no longer keep her. Here is what she says:\n\"Marley is very sweet and shy. She's good with cats, dogs, and people. She LOVES my toddler and is very protective of her so she's great with kids.\n\nShe seems to be scared of men, though. I suspect she may have been abused in the past.\nShe's not aggressive but she will squat and pee when she feels like shes going to get in trouble.\nWhen she first came to me, I would try to give her treats and she would pee on the floor.\nIt's gotten better with her but she still does it from time to time.\"\n\nMarley will be vetted and spayed before she is adopted. If you would like to meet Marley, call Sandra at 256 325 8873, or email her at adopt@tlcpaws.org 1/21/21 12:47 AM",

            "description": "Benito is a 40 pound adult Shep Whippet mix from India. Benito is one of the countless dogs saved by Guardians of All Voiceless. He was found paralyzed in his hind end at the bottom of a deep ditch. He had been there for a month, with a few caring people dropping food to him. He was miraculously and lovingly rehabilitated by the Guardians, and then adopted by a family in SC. Then Guardians learned that he was living OUTDOORS 24\u00d77\u00d7365 because he has issues with incontinence. Benito is sweet and hilarious and likes certain other dogs who are not scary to him. Dogs who are big or rambunctious could hurt him (as he is fragile). He does like to play with other gentle dogs. He loves bones and toys. He is essentially house trained, as he is NOT destructive and will potty outside as long as given the opportunity and schedule. He does need to have his bladder \"expressed\" (and I can show any potential adopter how simple this is), but he is able to control his defecating. If you might be the special person or family for Benito, please contact Bev at 804-248-3042 or TrampsRescue@yahoo.com.",

His leg somehow got entangled with string and cut his circulation.  He is small to medium in height, weighs 25lbs. His photos make him appear larger than he really is.\nHe is 7 yrs old.  He runs, plays like he has 4 legs. Very affectionate.\nHis owner, a senior citizen had to move in with her daughter & her husband. They cannot hold him for too long because they have a full house.\nPoor Sweetpea lost the only home he knew and the only owner he knew.\nHe loves everyone and other pets he meets.\nPlease open your heart to this angel.  He has so much love to give.\nGiselle: 504-481-1145",

I was in bad shape, but after some good eats, some TLC and some vetting I am looking good.\n\nI am spay, up to date on vaccines, microchipped and on monthly heartworm preventative. My adoption fee is $175. \n\nWith all that said, I did test positive for heartworms. I have had my round of doxycycline before I started my monthly medication.  If my new family decides they want to run me thru the more aggressive treatment, we have a donor who will cover the cost of that. My new family will have to get me to my vetting appointments and see that I follow instructions while receiving treatment. \n\nThe only thing deadly about heartworms is if nothing is done.\n\nNOW HERE IS THE BIGGIE. I MUST BE.... NO EXCEPTIONS...BE THE ONLY PET!!...I do not like other dogs and am sure a cat would be worse.  I love people and children. The person in my photos with me is a young lady about 14 yrs old and I love her and everyone else of the human kind that I meet. So I guess you could say, I want to be the only one with the key to your heart.\n\nThere is an application process. This does not lock you in, it just gets the adoption process started. A home visit is required and BFF can get that done, location is not an issue.\n\nREMEMBER WHEN ADOPTING A PET, IT CAN BE A 15++ YEAR COMMITMENT!! PLEASE ADOPT RESPONSIBLY!!!!",

I love walks and am great at not pulling on the leash, sometimes the squirrels excite me and I wanna go after them but respond well to the \"leave it\" command for most things. I do great with all people and just want snuggles and love from everyone. The closer I can snuggle the better. I definitely consider myself a lap dog. Sometimes I get too excited and jump up on people when they first come in, I'm learning that's not okay. My kennel has a lot of bad memories for me but my foster parents are showing me that it can be pretty nice, I eat two meals a day in there and I love to \"kennel up\" for some treats. I still get really anxious when my people aren't around. If I can't see them I'm worried they may be gone for good so I tend to whine until I can see them again. I do best when my fosters don't acknowledge my whining. I really love the smell of your people food and you better keep an eye on it or I'll try and nab it. My foster parents and working with me to learn things such as sit, lay down, stay, and leave it. I'm getting better everyday but if there's a lot of distractions around I tend not to listen as well. I love all humans but dogs, especially big or aggressive dogs still put me on high alert. My owner will need to learn how to handle me around other dogs and help me learn that they will protect me and I don't need to anymore. I'm fully potty trained and haven't had any accidents. I sleep at the foot of the bed at night on a bunch of blankets and pillows. I usually like to sleep in with my fosters until around 8 or 9. I'm not sure how I would do around cats but I may chase them like I do squirrels.\n\nAdoption fee includes: Full veterinary exam, alter, prepaid microchip, dewormed, Rabies vaccine, DAPP vaccine, Bordetella vaccine, 4DX\n\n, flea/tick and heartworm preventative while in rescue.

She walks well on leash.\nYou will not be allowed to meet and greet with our dogs until we have a completed application back from you. Once we have this and after approval to adopt from our group you will be able to meet all adoptable dogs who are a good fit for you and your family. \nPlease contact savapetwac@yahoo.com for an application. There is no cost to apply. There is an adoption fee for the dogs \u2013 puppies are typically $300 and adult dogs $200. \nPlease keep in mind that we are a small non-profit group run by volunteers and we all have full time jobs outside of the rescue group. We are not a shelter. Most dogs are in foster homes and any visits will need to be coordinated with the foster families. \n",

I just came to Pughearts recently and I am thrilled to be here! am only 3 years old and I am a beautiful fawn color with a gorgeous cinnamon roll tail. My foster parents seem to be OK. They seem to know how to raise a guy and I think I\u2019m doing OK. I\u2019m not a jumper furniture type of guy. But if I do get lifted up, I go to the best pillow. I am not potty trained either, but I am working on it every day. I get along with four brothers. I stay away from the old guy because he is a little grouchy. Sadly I am heartwarming positive and must go through treatment. I hope you find me as loving as my foster mommy says I am .",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Addi, as in Sweet Adeline. After a couple of years on the run and a few weeks in rescue, I'm ready to be adopted. Here is my story:\n\nI was abused by a group of men who are notoriously horrible to their deer dogs down around the Hot Springs area. One day when out hunting, I decided to make a break for it and I never went back. At the time, I felt it was a good idea ... wouldn't it be a better life if I could get away from that horrible existence? Well, for the next two years, I survived on my own, living in the woods and scrounging for food wherever I could find it. I also had no permanent shelter and just did the best I could, sleeping under sheds when the weather was cold or rainy and sleeping As luck would have it, this past October, I became pregnant and gave birth to a litter of little hound puppies. I was in such bad shape physically, basically starving, only one puppy survived. \n\nThen, a ray of sunshine came along. A kind man came to me and picked up my puppy. I was hopeful he would love her as much as I did. I was frightened for my baby, but there was nothing I could do. Later that day he came back with a big bowl of food for me, and the next day, more food, and the next day, even more food! Although I have always been afraid of humans thanks to the situation I was in from my birth, where I was treated like a piece of property, definitely not a pet, I began trusting him. He was kind, had food and spoke softly and gently to me. I wasn't sure if it was a good idea or not, but I gave in and let him catch me. He took me home and there was my baby! Safe and happy. (Her name is Abbi and she is up for adoption too!)\n\nI, however, was a wreck. Besides being extremely thin, I had mastitis and had to get to the dogtor immediately. So my new friend loaded me up and off we went. I'm over that hurdle. My next hurdle was having surgery to make certain I can have no more babies! It is so heartbreaking to watch your babies, one by one, die because you cannot give them what they need. So, I was all for that plan! Now spayed, microchipped and given my rabies shot, I am completely vetted and I'm gaining weight and my energy is coming back.\n\nThe nice people I live with are working with me to help me trust again ... it's hard ... but I am going to do it! I want to live in a home with loving people. \n\nMy perfect home would be one with one person or a couple. It needs to be a calm home. Another dog would be great as I could learn how to act more like a normal dog. At some point, I may be okay with kids, but at the present time, my caretakers believe that would not be a good idea and it would be frightening for me. In my foster home, I've learned house manners, crate training and leash trained. Once very fearful of riding in a car, now I happily hop right in! \n\nI am the perfect size, 40 pounds, and everyone tells me I'm beautiful. I must have soft toys at my new home. I love to gather them all around me and snuggle with them, pretending they are my babies. A fenced yard is necessary to keep me safe. \n\nI hope there is a home out there that will give me a chance. Maybe it's yours ...\n\nTo apply to adopt Addi, please click the link below. It will take you to our Adoption Application.\n\nTo make the best possible match for you and the pet, please click below to complete the Adoption Application. \n\nOnce your application has been processed, we'll be in contact. \n\nWe cannot schedule a meet and greet without a completed application. \n\nIf you are viewing this page through PetFinder, Adopt-a-Pet, etc., please go to http://ootwrescue.org/adoption.html to fill out an application or review our Adoption Process.",

            "description": "Please understand we must conduct home visits in order for any dogs to be adopted. This is merely for the safety of these rescues. All dogs are $125.00\nand up. Adoption fees in correlation with care & expenses required to make each animal healthy and ready for adoption. Some dogs require fenced in yards, please feel free to ask any of our volunteers if the animal you're interested in requires a fenced in yard.\n\nPlease call 850-968-3260 for information on any of the animals you see listed with the JHS (Jr. Humane Society)\n\n\nYana is a 2 year old Bulldog mix. She is up to date on shots and spayed. Yana is a very active dog, so she would love to be adopted by an active family or someone looking for a running partner! Yana would do best in a home with no cats or small kids. If you need a dog who can keep up with you on a hike, Yana is your girl!\n\n\n\nThe Junior Humane Society is a non-profit, all volunteer, animal rescue group. For over 30 years, we have helped animals in the Gulf Coast area. \nAll animals waiting for adoption are placed in foster homes. Before placing the animal in a furever home, JHS provides all necessary vet care, including but not limited to: shots, spaying, and neutering. \nWe hold adoptions event every Saturday at PetSmart in Pensacola, FL from 12-4",

He is friendly and social with everyone and his striking good looks turn heads everywhere he goes. He walks great on a leash and is housebroken and calm in the home. Whether you need a walking buddy or a cuddly companion on the couch, Drago aims to please! He is great with other dogs and enjoys playtime in his current caretaker's yard in GA. Because one of his greatest joys is running free in a fenced yard, he would most enjoy a home with that feature. Drago is safe now but was rescued from a high kill shelter in GA after landing there through no fault of his own. He will be transported here in a few days, however. If you are interested in meeting Drago or would like more information, please email adoptsch@gmail.com or message the Second Chance Habitat Facebook page.",

I don't really like other dogs, so I would ask to be your ONLY dog.  I'm not sure if I like cats or not, but I can find out.  I did live with some slithery reptiles once, they didn't bother me, so I didn't bother them.  I also lived with some older kids & I loved them, after I warmed up to them.  I'm a little shy at first.\n\nZee Zee is a pint sized girl, approximately 45 lbs., is house & crate trained, up to date on shots, heartworm negative, spayed & microchipped.  She's ready to go.  Bully breed experience a plus.\n\nZee Zee is currently residing at our shelter & really would LOVE to find a foster or adoptive home.  Her adoption donation is $175.00.\n\nIf interested in meeting Zee Zee, please complete an application at sapamo.org.",

DOB 10-20-18), female, 57 lbs., vetted, is or will be spayed, and micro-chipped. Roxy was surrendered to the shelter by her family (we believe she was found as a stray and they couldn't keep her). She seemed really sad, scared, and confused in the shelter. Don't worry Roxy; you are safe now! She knows Sit and takes treats gently. She tested well with other dogs and seems a little shy of men. She loves to get the zoomies in the yard! Stay tuned for more information as Roxy is a new rescue!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Roxy please fill out an Application at\n\nwww.Passion-4-Paws.org\n\n(please make sure you have the Vermont site not CT) - thanks!\n\nPlease note Fosters have 1st option of Adoption.\n\nCheck out her Facebook page (please \"Like\" us while you are there)!\n\nDisclosure:\n\nBreed labels are often incorrect: we rarely know the genetic lineage of the dogs we rescue. Many shelters and rescues specify breeds based on appearance; however, research has shown that less than 2% of a dog's DNA determines appearance!\n\nPassion 4 Paws does not practice the use of labels pertaining to compatibility with others or dog breed. Labels such as \"dog friendly\" and \"child friendly\" should be used with caution as they often over-simplify the personalities and behavior of dogs.",

DOB 6-17-18), female, 60 lbs., vetted, is or will be spayed, and micro-chipped.\n\nTonya was found homeless after being dumped off in a rural heavily wooded area with her BFF Rachel. They were loaded with ticks and had porcupine quills around their mouth. they would do best in a home with a yard and outside of a City environment (no apartments please). She is being fostered in a more rural area with Rachel and has been doing very well. Tonya's ideal home is one that is active and experienced to help her with training; she is very smart. No cats as she does demonstrate a prey drive and a home without very young children would be ideal as she is very excitable and a larger dog. A secure fenced in yard would be ideal for her to run and play!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Tonya please fill out an Application at\n\nwww.Passion-4-Paws.org\n\n(please make sure you have the Vermont site not CT) - thanks!\n\nPlease note Fosters have 1st option of Adoption.\n\nCheck out her Facebook page (please \"Like\" us while you are there)!\n\nDisclosure:\n\nBreed labels are often incorrect: we rarely know the genetic lineage of the dogs we rescue. Many shelters and rescues specify breeds based on appearance; however, research has shown that less than 2% of a dog's DNA determines appearance!\n\nPassion 4 Paws does not practice the use of labels pertaining to compatibility with others or dog breed. Labels such as \"dog friendly\" and \"child friendly\" should be used with caution as they often over-simplify the personalities and behavior of dogs.",

These ladies are the full package\u2014athletic, smart, spry, fun-loving, obedient and still young enough to take on the world right by your side! \n\nPlease meet Molly Flint and Laken Flint! They are Lab mixes weighing in at 45 lbs of total cuteness! They were owner surrendered from Texas because their owner was moving. They are very close, even though they are not litter mates. Laken is considered special needs due to a deformed spine, but as you can see, it does not prevent her from walking, running or enjoying life. Her tail always lays to one side and while she is housebroken, every now and then she has accidents because she doesn\u2019t have excellent tone and doesn\u2019t realize. These very special girls would be lost without each other, so bonding their adoption is very important. They love attention, cuddling on the couch and being your best friends. They love playing outside, going for walks and riding in the car. They also love to help you cook, if you will let them, and they can find every morsel that you drop. They are housebroken and crate trained, and ABSOLUTELY ADORE TOYS, especially those that squeak and crinkle. They have adorable personalities, especially once they get to know you and settle in. They would love a family of their very own where they can enjoy life, relax, play, spend the day at the beach or sit by a bonfire. Whatever the adventure, these are your girls!\n\nIf you are interested in these adorable girls, please get your apps in as fast as you can!\n\nTHE APPLICATION LINK CAN BE FOUND ON OUR PETFINDER PAGE UNDER THE PICTURE. \n\nANIMAL INFORMATION:  \nName:  Laken Flint\nBreed:  Lab mix\nGender:  Female         \nAge:  1 1/2 years            \nWeight: 40 lbs           \nSpayed/Neutered: Yes                \nVaccines: Current                      \nHeartworm:  Tested negative on 8/28/2020, currently on Heartgard\nMicrochipped: Yes\n\nFOSTER EVALUATION AND RECOMMENDATION:\nDogs:  Yes, fostering with dogs of various sizes, breeds and genders\nCats:  Unknown\nOther Small Animals:  Unknown\nChildren:  Yes, they have NOT been tested with infants or toddlers, so proper supervision and introductions would be required. \n\nADOPTION INFORMATION:\nWe are a foster-based animal rescue and we thank you for your interest in one of our animals. Our animals are fostered in various locations in the a South and in New England. Our fosters and adoption coordinators are the backbone of what we do. Our fosters work tirelessly to integrate our rescue animals into their home, so that we can provide as much information to potential adopters as possible. In addition, our coordinators offer as much information regarding the medical and behavioral and personality characteristics as is known to our organization. Without them, and our extremely generous donors, we would not be able to save as many animals as we do every day. With each adoption, we operate a Pay It Forward program, whenever possible, to help other animals in our rescue and future animals in need. \n\nIf you are interested in one of our animals, please complete an application. The application link can be found on our Petfinder homepage under the picture. You may also find our application on our website at www.petmatchmakerrescue.com under the Adopt page. If they are listed on our website, their adoptions have not been finalized yet. That does not mean that we have not received several applications, already. Please complete an application if you are interested and we will keep you apprised of their current status. We are all volunteers who work full-time jobs and have animals of our own, so please be patient with us. We will get back with you as quickly as possible.  \n\nIf you are interested in fostering for our organization, please complete an application.  The application link can be found on our Petfinder homepage under the picture.",

Its Lobo. Haha\nI am the perfect package. I am smart and good looking. I like a lot of attention so I hope you like to snuggle and spend time outside with me. I like to keep my figure so I need a family who is active like me. I love to run like a goofball. I run like no-one is watching. I love training and hanging out with my training partner. I am a loyal dog and want someone who stand by my sides because I will always stand by their. I am dog friendly, even though I am big. I play gently with others.

These ladies are the full package\u2014athletic, smart, spry, fun-loving, obedient and still young enough to take on the world right by your side! \n\nPlease meet Molly Flint and Laken Flint! They are Lab mixes weighing in at 45 lbs of total cuteness! They were owner surrendered from Texas because their owner was moving. They are very close, even though they are not litter mates. Laken is considered special needs due to a deformed spine, but as you can see, it does not prevent her from walking, running or enjoying life. Her tail always lays to one side and while she is housebroken, every now and then she has accidents because she doesn\u2019t have excellent tone and doesn\u2019t realize. These very special girls would be lost without each other, so bonding their adoption is very important. They love attention, cuddling on the couch and being your best friends. They love playing outside, going for walks and riding in the car. They also love to help you cook, if you will let them, and they can find every morsel that you drop. They are housebroken and crate trained, and ABSOLUTELY ADORE TOYS, especially those that squeak and crinkle. They have adorable personalities, especially once they get to know you and settle in.

Whatever the adventure, these are your girls!\n\nIf you are interested in these adorable girls, please get your apps in as fast as you can!\n\nTHE APPLICATION LINK CAN BE FOUND ON OUR PETFINDER PAGE UNDER THE PICTURE. \n\n\nANIMAL INFORMATION:  \nName:  Molly Flint\nBreed:  Lab mix\nGender:  Female         \nAge:  6 1/2 years             \nWeight: 98 lbs           \nSpayed/Neutered: Yes                \nVaccines: Current                      \nHeartworm:  Tested negative on 8/26/2020, currently on Heartgard\nMicrochipped: Yes\n\nFOSTER EVALUATION AND RECOMMENDATION:\nDogs:  Yes, fostering with dogs of various sizes, breeds and genders\nCats:  Unknown\nOther Small Animals:  Unknown\nChildren:  Yes, They have NOT been tested with infants or toddlers, so proper supervision and introductions would be required. \n\nADOPTION INFORMATION:\nWe are a foster-based animal rescue and we thank you for your interest in one of our animals. Our animals are fostered in various locations in the a South and in New England. Our fosters and adoption coordinators are the backbone of what we do. Our fosters work tirelessly to integrate our rescue animals into their home, so that we can provide as much information to potential adopters as possible. In addition, our coordinators offer as much information regarding the medical and behavioral and personality characteristics as is known to our organization. Without them, and our extremely generous donors, we would not be able to save as many animals as we do every day. With each adoption, we operate a Pay It Forward program, whenever possible, to help other animals in our rescue and future animals in need. \n\nIf you are interested in one of our animals, please complete an application. The application link can be found on our Petfinder homepage under the picture. You may also find our application on our website at www.petmatchmakerrescue.com under the Adopt page. If they are listed on our website, their adoptions have not been finalized yet. That does not mean that we have not received several applications, already. Please complete an application if you are interested and we will keep you apprised of their current status. We are all volunteers who work full-time jobs and have animals of our own, so please be patient with us. We will get back with you as quickly as possible.  \n\nIf you are interested in fostering for our organization, please complete an application.  The application link can be found on our Petfinder homepage under the picture.",

The person was unable to find a suitable home for her, so she entered our rescue program.  She is a 4 year old girl who is friendly and  sweet , a little shy at first. She is nervous around young children, so would do best in a quiet home with adults and older children.  Precious does shed, all \"doodle\" mixes are not nonshedders. We are not certain Precious is a doodle - she could be mixed with a sheepdog breed.  She would enjoy the companionship of another dog. She has not been tested with cats,  but due to her calm nature, would probably be fine with them. Precious does have allergies, which can result in itching, and ear infections.  She will need an adopter who can financially afford to provide medical care for her.   Precious loves human companionship, and getting attention. We do recommend crating her until she learns your schedule. We also recommend obedience training for all newly adopted pyrs, to help you create a special bond with you and your new friend, and so you have a well behaved canine. Great Pyrenees are willing to learn, but are not as eager to comply with commands as much as other breeds. They are bred to be independent thinkers. Applicants must be over 25, own their own home and all children in household must be over 6 years old. Your resident pets must be up to date on vaccines, sterilized, you must have a good history of vet care for them, and you must have used heartworm preventative year round for your dogs. \n\n\nPrecious will be placed as an inside pet with outside privileges. You MUST have a securely fenced yard accessible from your home. Invisible fencing does not work with this breed and they will take the shock for the freedom.  Great Pyrenees are bred to roam and will create their own territory if not secured, which can led to them being lost, hit by vehicles or shot by people who see them as a threat. The breed is not a good off leash dog, and cannot be trusted to not run away.  A Great Pyrenees off leash is a \" DisAPyr.\" \n\nIf you are interested in adopting or fostering, please complete the appropriate application on our website, www.igpr.org under the Adopt tab. \n\nAll of our dogs marked as needing foster homes are also available for adoption.  If a dog is listed on this site, it is available.  No need to contact us to see if it is,  We do require you  complete the adoption application prior to meeting a dog.\n\nWe also offer a foster to adopt program. You foster the dog, and have first right of refusal on them if an approved application is submitted for them. \n\nIn fostering a dog, the dog comes to you fully vetted. and groomed. You provide good quality food, grooming, and we provide the heartworm preventative and medical care, if needed* .(*Based on approval from IGPR.)\n\nAdoption fee is $350",

Gus is 87% American Bulldog and 13% Boxer. He is a ten year old dog who was picked up stray and taken to the local shelter. He was rescued and has been living in our senior sanctuary. We learned that Gus has a brain injury and cranial nerve injury. He can't bark, use his tongue, open his mouth wide, and his third eyelid is permanently closed over his left eye. Gus has multiple mast cell tumors. The tumors are very small and do not require removal.\n\nGus is a wonderful companion, loves cuddling, car rides, tummy rubs and back scratches. He hugs with both front legs, gives his paw, and sits on command.\n\nGus weighs 106 pounds and drools when he is hungry. Eating is a real challenge for Gus but if you give him enough time and space, he gets it done. Gus does not like elevated feeders and will take his bowl out and place it on the floor.\n\nGus is an indoor dog. He has exquisite house manners. He is neutered, negative for all tick- and mosquito-borne illnesses, up-to-date on Rabies and vaccinations, and OH yeah, he sheds.\n\nIf you have a heart for seniors please consider fostering or adopting Gus.Adoption fees are $200 unless otherwise stated. Senior residents of Dot's Old Dogs Home are generally not available for adoption. 100% of adoption fees are put back into the rescue so that another lonely and neglected chained/penned dog or yard-sale dog can be rescued. We are grateful for your interest.\n\nUpon approval, the adoption fee is non-refundable. The fee includes the following: de-worming; grooming (if applicable); heartworm, lymes, ehrlichia and anaplasmosis testing; all vaccinations including rabies; flea and tick treatment, microchipping and spay/neuter.\n\nPlease contact us if you have questions about our adoptable dogs, we would love to talk to you!",

Shes a very sweet girl, who is doing really well in foster care, but is now ready for her forever home. She is house trained and crate trained. She has not had many life experiences, which makes her a bit shy with new people. Her new person can help her discover our great big world to overcome her shyness! \n\nLyla has rough and tumble fun with her foster brothers and she also loves toys and balls. She is full of energy, and would make a great running partner. We believe she would also excel at agility, or another doggie sport of her liking. Lyla completed a 4-week basic obedience program and did very well learning commands. \n\nLyla has more of the Malinois traits, is somewhat of a dominant female, and is really smart. An adopter must commit to continuing her training, and offering her firm guidance and leadership, setting boundaries and behavior expectations based upon positive re-enforcement methods. This will keep Lyla physically and mentally challenged, and ensure she remains on the path of a well-behaved canine citizen.\n\nAn adult-only adopter who understands the Belgian Malinois temperament, and have experience in successfully raising this breed will only be considered. Due to her prey drive, an adoptive home must not have cats or small critters. While she does get along with non-invasive male dogs, we feel she would be best suited as an only dog.\n\nOur sweet pup will make a great companion dog for whoever is lucky enough to adopt her. Are you ready to go and meet that big world with this beautiful dog at your side?",

            "description": "Hidey was pulled with her two teenage puppies from a shelter on the Kentucky West Virginia border. They entire family was scared and undersocialized, likely knowing neglect and possibly abuse before arriving at the shelter. We are guessing her to be a 5 year old fiest mix and is about 25 pounds. After coming into rescue, she immediately began to hide and play hard to get, hence her name HIDEy. You can tell that she wants to make the break through to trust her foster family, and she keeps following them around closely, but as soon as they stretch to pet her...off she darts, until their back is turned again. Hidey is completely crate trained with no accidents, but the trick with her is catching her to get her to go into her crate at night. This scared girl isn't an off the shelf pet, she is more of a project pet and needs someone with patience and empathy that can help her take that final leap into trust and become the loving pet that she wants to be. Despite her fear, she is not a fear biter, once cornered she will allow her person to pick her up, pet her or handle her.\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting this baby, please fill out an application. They currently are fixed, up to date on shots, wormings, preventatives and are microchipped. Adoption fee is $188 ($175 Adoption Fee + $13 Lifetime Registration Fee for Microchip), applications can be filled out at this link. https://www.petstablished.com/adoption_form/10167/generic .We cannot guarantee breed or size when full grown.\n\nDue to our current situation, with more great applicants than we have available puppies and young adults, we are no longer accepting applications from people that are over 150 miles away. Exceptions will be made on dogs over the age of 3, special needs dogs and direct referrals from our volunteers.",

I'm a senior chow mix estimated to be between 10-14 years old.\n\nIm aloof as chows tend to be. I take my treats very nicely after starring at you and barking in demand for them. I LOVE going out the front door for walks, but as Im an older girl, around my fosters court is quite far enough. Dont try to just put me outside in the back yard thinking that will do....I am very smart, I know the difference! I know to go potty outside. I don't like crates but I'm a perfect lady being left out in the house. I am not interested in steps. I dont care that the humans are upstairs or downstairs, Im happy to sleep at the bottom. I do not get on furniture and I dont want to sleep in your bed. Im not fond of car rides. Im not bad, I will just whine and make sure you know Im not thrilled. My foster brother is an old, grouchy Weimaraner. I have no problem getting along with him. Im not sure Id like a younger sibling but an older one like him or none at all would be just fine. My foster family has four older kids - I love them (I dont think Id care for younger ones though). \n\nI'd love to meet you if you think I'd be a good fit for your home. Apply today at rescuedohio.org so we can meet up. My adoption fee is $195.",

            "description": "IN VERMONT\n\nMeet Santa! Here is her video collage in NC/SC:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/-2yjRfHukFY\n\nSanta is 4 years old (approx. DOB 6-1-16), female, 45 lbs., vetted, is or will be spayed, and micro-chipped. This bob tailed beauty is quite a looker! She is a great girl who was picked up by Animal Control as a homeless stray while out on adventure with other stray dogs (including Nova)! We have been told she gets along well with other dogs in daycare, likes to play, takes treats gently, has low-medium energy, easy going, and is good on a leash. Santa seems to love everyone and likes to be inside more than outside! Stay tuned for more information as Santa is a new rescue!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Santa please fill out an Application at\n\nwww.Passion-4-Paws.org\n\n(please make sure you have the Vermont site not CT) - thanks!\n\nPlease note Fosters have 1st option of Adoption.\n\nCheck out his Facebook page (please \"Like\" us while you are there)!\n\nDisclosure:\n\nBreed labels are often incorrect: we rarely know the genetic lineage of the dogs we rescue. Many shelters and rescues specify breeds based on appearance; however, research has shown that less than 2% of a dog's DNA determines appearance!\n\nPassion 4 Paws does not practice the use of labels pertaining to compatibility with others or dog breed. Labels such as \"dog friendly\" and \"child friendly\" should be used with caution as they often over-simplify the personalities and behavior of dogs.",

He weighs 57 pounds. He doesn't act like an older dog at all and he LOVES toys. When you first open the door to the dog kennels, Champ is always standing there with his toy pickle in his mouth. He is a funny fella!\nHe wants to be the dominant dog so he is best suited as an only dog. He also doesn't have patience for young kids.\nHe is heartworm and e.canis negative, neutered, up to date on shots and microchipped. He was treated for Lyme disease and that finished several weeks ago.\nHe would be best suited as the only dog in the home and without young children.\nHis adoption fee has been paid by a supporter however an approved application is still required.\nIf interested, apply at www.humanesocietyofmartincounty.org. Our shelter is currently open by appointment and we need an adoption application prior to scheduling an appointment.",

I'm an enormously sweet and maternal dog, who along with raising my own 6 pups, I took in 2 other puppies who weren't even mine to raise. I am very friendly with people and dogs but I can be scared and timid. I'm a much older dog and tend to be shy in new situations, but I'm extremely lovable. The team here at the ranch think that there's a possibility that I may be partially blind, however, this would make me a great fit for a home that already has a cat or other small animals. Because of my timid nature, I would do best in a home with an experienced dog owner who can teach me how to do to dog things! I could absolutely be happy in an apartment, but I would have to be able to get more comfortable walking on leash, which is very scary for me right now. I'm not the type of dog that would be happy going out and having adventures in public with you but I absolutely want to snuggle up next to you on the couch. I would benefit from further training but I am potty-trained. Also keep in mind, I can be a bit of an escape artist as I learned how to open my crate here on the ranch. All in all, I'm a dog that could be a great fit for anyone looking for a loving companion, I just need a little bit more confidence in myself.",

            "description": "Meet Flea! \n\nFlea is an 8 mo old, 30 lb mutt. He's super playful and loves giving kisses and getting cuddles. He is high energy and loves playing with other dogs.  He is fabulous at the dog park and loves getting his energy out at doggie daycare with his doggie buddies.  He is deaf and has some vision impairment, but that doesn't slow him down one bit.  He is the happiest wiggle butt around.  He will require a fenced in yard and doggie buddy to buddy up with to learn and play.\n\nInterested in meeting Flea? \n\nAll Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue dogs are in homes with foster families; we do not have a shelter where dogs are available for daily viewing.\n\nOur process is as follows:\n1.  Review our policies and adoption radius  on our website: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n2.  Submit an application for review and approval;\n3.  MPM Rescue reviews application and checks vet records and references;\n4.  MPM foster contacts approved applicant(s) to arrange a home check and meeting with available dog(s);\n5.   If there is a good fit, adoption is completed with a contract and fees (payable via check or cash).\n\nThe adoption fee is listed here: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n\nDogs from Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue come with the following medical care already provided:\n- Spay/Neuter surgery\n- Age appropriate vaccinations\n- Heartworm test (for dogs over 6mo) and treatment if positive\n- Microchip\n- Deworming\n- Heartworm and Flea/Tick Preventative\n- Any other necessary medical treatment as recommended by veterinarian\n\n*Please note that the identified breed(s) are best guesses. We very rarely have information on our dogs' actual breeds since they often come to the shelters we work with as strays.*",

            "description": "Meet Pongo! \n\nPongo is one chill dude! He is a handsome 5 year old Shepherd Special and weighs about 60lbs. His favorite things include sniffing the leaves, head scratches, and lounging on his dog bed and relaxing with his people. He is such an easy dog to care for and would make a great addition to just about any family. He is housetrained, walks great on a leash, and is good with kids and other calm dogs. He\u2019s the perfect buddy for winter and beyond!\n\nPongo is about 5 years old. Potty and crate trained. Very low key guy! He loves humans and all their affection. He would prefer to be an only dog, but might get along with a dog that mostly leaves him alone!\n\nInterested in meeting Pongo? \n\nAll Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue dogs are in homes with foster families; we do not have a shelter where dogs are available for daily viewing.\n\nOur process is as follows:\n1.  Review our policies and adoption radius  on our website: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n2.  Submit an application for review and approval;\n3.  MPM Rescue reviews application and checks vet records and references;\n4.  MPM foster contacts approved applicant(s) to arrange a home check and meeting with available dog(s);\n5.   If there is a good fit, adoption is completed with a contract and fees (payable via check or cash).\n\nThe adoption fee is listed here: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n\nDogs from Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue come with the following medical care already provided:\n- Spay/Neuter surgery\n- Age appropriate vaccinations\n- Heartworm test (for dogs over 6mo) and treatment if positive\n- Microchip\n- Deworming\n- Heartworm and Flea/Tick Preventative\n- Any other necessary medical treatment as recommended by veterinarian\n\n*Please note that the identified breed(s) are best guesses. We very rarely have information on our dogs' actual breeds since they often come to the shelters we work with as strays.*",

When he was found he was torn to pieces and left on the side of the road like garbage. A nice person took him water and called us. Through all of this King has loved people. Understandably, King is very anxious around other animals. King has just completed a 2 week training camp to help with leash manners and is doing wonderfully! This is important because he is a big guy! \nKing needs a home with,\nSomeone who likes to snuggle\nSomeone with no other pets\nSomeone who likes to walk\nSomeone with a 6ft privacy fence\nKing is amazing and deserves a wonderful life! He is 3 years old and is housetrained! Please message us if you are interested in King!\n\nStop by the shelter to meet King and our other adoptable animals any day but Tuesday from 12-4.",

We're not sure why he was there in the first place, but we're happy to be the bridge to the new life he deserves! Sarge is a 7 yr old Lab mix. He weighs about 70 lbs, and is steadily gaining healthy weight. He is really sweet and loving, and bonds easily to any human he meets. Sarge loves to ride in cars and go for walks, so someone looking for an adventure buddy would be a great match for him! He is pretty quiet and relaxed, but does like regular activity so someone with a fenced yard where he can run and play would be ideal. Sarge is mostly blind but it seems he can see shadows and lights. He navigates his area pretty well and goes in and out of a doggie door with no issues. Due to his vision, it is best that he is not in a home with small children. He seems to do well with friendly dogs, but prefers a cat free home. Sarge is just such a gem, and we can't wait for you to meet him!! He is neutered, house trained and up to date on vaccines. Email us at lasthoperescuefl@gmail.com to adopt!",

If you want to fetch or tug or jog... so does he. If you want to binge watch comedy specials... so does he. Steve is a nice guy that doesn't love a surprise. He wants to see your friends coming, but once he does, he's quick to love them because this guy wants an audience. Steve's residual puppy energy shows up when he starts demanding the spotlight. He just needs a consistent and firm friend to let him know he can't always be center stage. He has skills like sit and shake, and he is a dream to take on a long walk. He will count on you to keep him a safe distance from other dogs when you are out and about because they aren't his biggest fans. Ideally, Steve would love a big safe yard, a lifetime supply of tennis balls and squeaky toys, and people that can devote some time into teaching him how to be a better boy. He's ready to take the stage.",

Max is a bit shy and does not like to be picked up from the front (under his arms) so you need to let him know you are picking him up\u2026.but once you have him, he loves to sit on your lap and to cuddle.  Max was surrendered to the shelter with 3 other Chihuahua mixes - we took 2 of the 4; Max and Molly and the other 2 were privately adopted. Max has the typical energy of a 5 yrs old dog, and he is absolutely adorable. Max will need an adopter who will look past his shyness and to take a chance on him. Another small and older dog in the home would be a good fit for Max.\n\nMax Faxs:\n\n\u2022\tHouse trained using a doggie door \n\u2022\tLeash trained and loves to walk\n\u2022\tMax is small and can easily travel everywhere with his family!\n\u2022\tMax is microchipped, current on vaccines and is neutered\n\u2022\tMax just had a complete dental and blood panel done last week!\n\u2022\tCute as a button and so deserving of his own forever family\n\nMax\u2019s perfect home will have a yard, another older small dog and preferably with someone who works from home, is retired, or will not leave him alone for long hours of the day. \n\nLike most dogs, Max would love nothing more than a warm lap and a family to call his own. \n\n",

EASY PEASY!\n\nOnce we've reviewed your application, arrangements can be made for you guys to meet! It'll be kind of like a blind date!\n\n***\n\nThis pet is spayed or neutered in accordance with our strict policy wherein all animals are altered prior to adoption. This pet is dewormed, current on vaccines, and started on monthly flea/tick and preventatives.\n\nAnimal Alliance's policy is that we will adopt dogs younger than 1 year old to families with children under 9 years old. We do not adopt dogs 1 year or older to families with children under 9 years old due to the unknown history of adult dogs. \n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY:  Meetings at our Adoption Center are by appointment only (no walk-ins).  An online adoption application is required and must be approved prior to meeting any animals.  Adoption appointments are set up by email by our Adoption Coordinator (no phone calls, please).  This process ensures our dedicated time to the animals in our care, as well as full attention to adopters at scheduled times.  \n\nPrior to submitting an application, please see the Animal Alliance Adoption Process for adoption details.\n\nTo fill out an adoption application, go to:\nhttps://www.animalalliancenj.org/fosteradoption-application/",

            "description": "Zena is in need of a home that will give her the companionship and love she's looking for. Her owner died suddenly under tragic circumstances, and his closest family members cannot keep her. Like many dogs she has separation anxiety and is missing her original owner, but this also suggests that she'll be a loyal pet who won't run off - she'll become attached to her new owner. Zena is good with other dogs but not cats. She's a friendly dog and sure would like a new home she can call her own. For more information please call Meghan at home 530 474-1729 (no early morning or late night calls please).  After losing her home through no fault of her own, Zena deserves a second chance at having a family.\n\n* note - if you call and get no answer and no voicemail, it means our power is out due to high fire danger or winter storms. Please try again - usually our power is restored within 1-2 days.",

He walks well on a leash, is kennel-trained, and knows basic commands like Sit, Stay, Come, Down, Leave It, Fetch, and Drop It.  He would do best in a home with no toddlers but loves to play, especially tug-of-war and chase.  He is a regal follow that enjoys a good bone and napping on a sunny porch.  If you are looking for a high-energy, fun-loving dog, Beau may be the one for you!  He will need a fenced-in yard but wants to please his new people and show off his nice house manners (like not chewing on anything he's not supposed to), so submit an application from our website eastmsanimalrescue.com to meet him.  All the hard work has been done with him, so you get to enjoy a well-trained companion!\n\nA few more notes about Beau:\n-Is a fan of the couch, beds, and is a perfect-sized leg warmer for a recliner\n-How can you resist those eyes?\n-Good boy with youthful energy\n-Does a cute butt wiggle when you greet him\n-Very loving and likes snuggles\n-Would be great with an active family or as a walking/running partner\n-Likes car rides and loves toys\n-Doesn't bark much (except at goats)",

She is in need of a home that can provide a calm and safe environment while she continues to decompress and learn to trust. She prefers when people go slow upon meeting her and give her space to warm up, while continuing to mentally stimulate her by keeping up her training!!! She loves her food and loves going outside to sniff the new smells on walks too! Dixie is very chill. She is great with other dogs but not cats.  She would also do best with older children that are gentle and dog savvy. ?The shaved areas in the photos are because she had an noncancerous growth removed from the side of her face.   http://www.angelsinfurdogrescue.com/adoption-application/",

Why this pet is the one for you:Meet Carson! Carson is a shy guy looking for a quiet home to call his own. He previously lived with many dogs, a large number of them smaller than him, and while he has been in our care Carson has had successful interactions with dogs of varying sizes as long as they are appropriate and respectful. Carson is also currently in a foster home with another dog about the same size and seeks out her company around the house. The biggest piece of this guy's success in a new home will be finding the right canine match for him to live with. Although Carson has shown his comfort greatly increases when he's with the right match, he isn't going to mesh well with all doggy personalities. Carson prefers a dog that is extremely respectful, and rough and tumble play is not his jam. Due to this, Carson must meet all other dogs in the home prior to adoption and must go home with another dog. All human members of the household must meet Carson before adopting him too. Carson should not go to a home with anyone under the age of twelve. \n\n\n\n Primary Color: Brown Secondary Color: White Weight: 49lbs Age: 3yrs 5mths 2wks Animal has been Neutered",

I lived outside my whole life and was surrendered to the shelter along with my eight brothers and sisters. I hit the jackpot and love my new place in a loving foster home. During the day you can find my lounging in my very own condo (crate), with my favorite blanket surrounded by lots of fun toys. I am learning the joys of love and affection from my humans, and sometimes I get so excited I just start doing zoomies all over the house! Sitting with my humans on their lap and getting pet is simply the best. If you scratch my head and ears eyes will start to close. I also like to go on walks and do great with my harness and leash. I'm looking for a forever family that will continue to love and spoil me. Is that with you?\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit the I.C.A.R.E. Dog Rescue website and complete an adoption application: www.icaredogrescue.org/ready-to-adopt\n\nAdoption fee includes: spay/neuter shots up to date micro-chip fecal and vet check",

He came to Rescue Dogs Dream two months ago after he was left abandoned in a home and the owners told the realtor to just have him put to sleep. She couldn\u2019t do that, so she contacted us and asked us to help. Shadow is improving daily in a loving foster home but really wants to find his forever family. He is Heartworm positive but we have already started his treatment and he will come with a 1-year supply of heartguard. When we first got him he had extensive hair loss from flea dermatitis but with healthy salmon food and medicated baths, he\u2019s doing great. He also was having a lot of difficulty walking but we have adjusted his pain medications and he\u2019s doing great (we will provide 6 months of pain medication.)  Shadow is 8 years old, weighs 55lbs, and is a total sweetheart, he loves to snuggle with his person, go on short walks and ride in the car. He is neutered, microchipped, and up to date on shots. He is potty trained and crate trained. Can someone be his guardian angel and give him a FOREVER HOME?  Shadow is located in Dunnellon FL. If you are interested in setting up a meet and greet to meet sweet Shadow, please go to our website at www.rescuedogsdream.com and fill out an application located under ( about us) or email us at rescuedogsdream@gmail.com, or private message us on Facebook at Rescue Dogs Dream, Inc.",

            "description": "Jasper is estimated to be around 10 years old. He's a rescued senior Chihuahua in foster care. He would thrive best as being the only pet in a home. He does love to play with other dogs outside, at the dog beach, or dog park. He loves walks and is leash trained. Car rides are his favorite! He is in a foster home with other dogs and cats, but he barks at them over food/beds. He recently had a dental and has only 1 tooth left. He is neutered, up to date on vaccinations, and eats soft food only. He's very cuddly and is needing a loving home! We have an adoption application, 2-week foster period and $100 adoption fee.",

ADOPTED! ADOPTED! ADOPTED! ADOPTED! ADOPTED! ADOPTED! ALL OF MY PICTURES ARE AVAILABLE BELOW! INTAKE INFORMATION: Hello! My name is Coh, and I just arrived at CSAC from a shelter. I was found as a stray on the street, and I was flea infested. The volunteers say I am calm, happy, affectionate, cuddly and curious. Even though I am blind, I was able to jump right into the car and onto the seat. I love sitting on laps and getting love and affection. Right now, I am in the caring hands of one of the great Vets that work with the CSAC. They are checking me out and making sure I am healthy. Hopefully, I will find my new family that will turn me into a happy, cherished pet. For more information about this dog, email our Adoption Coordinator. Our adoption process starts with an application. If you are interested in adopting this pup, please go back to the web site and click the Adopt menu at the top of the screen, read about our process, and click the application link. The medical and custodial care of the many Cockers in our care is tremendous. More and more dogs are abandoned with urgent and serious medical issues. We are committed to providing the best possible care for these forgotten friends. Unfortunately, the mounting high costs are beginning to limit the number of dogs we are able to take into our program. Even if you cannot adopt or foster one of our current adoptable dogs, please consider making a donation. The Cocker Spaniel Adoption Center is a 501(c)(3) non-profit charitable organization, and your donations are entirely tax deductible. Go back to the web site and click the Donate menu at the top of the screen. For more information, visit www.cockeradoptions.org. 1/24/21 4:43 PM",

            "description": "\n\nHey there everyone! My name is Nilly! Well, technically I am named Manila, but Nilly is such a happy go lucky nickname, it fits me perfectly! My foster mom says when she thinks of me, she thinks of the theme song to the Andy Griffith Show, the light-hearted whistle tune. I\u2019ve never heard it, because I\u2019m a lot younger than my foster mom, (she says she is showing her age by knowing that song). Well, anyway,it is a happy tune and she says it fits me!\n\nI am 4.5 years old, and such a pretty girl, if I do say so myself. I lived with a really nice lady almost my whole life, and she loved me a lot. How do I know? Well, when I was born, I had a BIG handicap. The veterinarian said I was a \u2018swimmer puppy\u2019. The vet even said I should be put down. But the nice lady couldn\u2019t bear that thought and took me home anyway, she saw my loving personality and my sunny disposition. After I was about a year old, I got my pins under me, and let me tell you I never looked back. I can do the zoomies in the yard just as good as any of them!! I don\u2019t have any trouble negotiating things, but on occasion I get a little too hasty and bump into things. If you have a Ming vase in your house, you might want to put it up out of my reach\u2026.\n\nI\u2019m sure you are wondering why I am in rescue. My family moved from town out to a ranch, and that\u2019s where it started. Well, I am ashamed to say my prey drive got the best of me one day. My family had a bum calf in a pen. I managed to squiggle through the fence and the pursuit was on. No, I didn\u2019t do unfixable harm, but the family knew it better not happen again, so here I am. I can\u2019t get out where I am at now, but I sure would like to see how fast those deer can run, bet I could catch them if I really tried. My foster mom wants you to know I must have secure fencing. Due to my hind legs not being as strong, I can\u2019t jump or climb out but I will try to find a way to dig or squiggle through a weak spot if there is a temptation out there.\n\nMy foster mom thinks I would be best as an only dog, simply because I do have a weakness in my hind legs and tend to be protective of them and wouldn\u2019t appreciate another dog rough-housing with me. Cats would not be good, unless you want to see if I can catch one, (just kidding). Children would need to be 8 and up in age, and respectful of me. I would not intentionally hurt one, but I could accidentally knock over a small child.\n\nA few words from Nilly\u2019s foster mom: She is a delight!!! Happy is an understatement. She is a special needs girl, but should live a long and wonderful life. An ideal home would be someone that is there all the time, she follows me around like a shadow. She has lived outside much of the second half of her life, but I think house-training would be quite easy. She is protective of me when my other dogs are around, therefore my thoughts she might do best as an only dog. She is spayed, chipped, and up to date on all vaccinations. As she ages, a lot of stairs in the household would not be good, and slippery floors either. But when it comes to being a loving dog, she can\u2019t be topped!\n",

Butch is a very stand offish little boy that doesnt know how to accept love. He is very sweet once he does and should go to a home with another dog to show him its okay to be loved on.The first step in adopting an animal is to fill out the application. For an application please see our website www.tanyasinc.org and download an application and e-mail it to us. All dogs are spayed/neutered, current on vaccinations, dewormed, and are treated with advantix for fleas and ticks. They are also micro chipped(transfer of registration to your name is $20.00). With every adoption you will also receive coupons from PETCO.The best way to get ahold of us is to e-mail Tanya at tanyasinc@msn.com",

            "description": "Autumn is a 3 year old female Hairy Hairless Chinese Crested rescued from a breeder. When we first rescued her she could barely walk and use her back legs. She was taken to the vet right away for testing.\nX-rays looked fine, blood work came back normal however she does have a grade 1 heart murmur. Other than that they said she just had severely underdeveloped muscles and is underweight. She\u2019s on puppy food and getting lots of exercise.\n\nIf you think you would be interested, please complete our no obligation application and we can start the process at www.luv4k9s.org. Select Available Dogs then scroll down to application, complete and submit. \n\nA physical secure fence attached to the residence is a requirement to adopt a dog from our rescue. Invisible fence doesn't meet this requirement. No exceptions.\n\nOur adoption area is primarily OHIO. We will consider KENTUCKY, AND INDIANA AND CERTAIN AREAS OF MICHIGAN, WEST VIRGINIA, AND PENNSYLVANIA if it\u2019s the best fit for the dog.\n\nWE DO NOT SHIP NOR ARRANGE TRANSPORTS.\n\nTHE APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED AND SUBMITTED BEFORE WE CAN START THE PROCESS. \n\nIT CAN TAKE AT LEAST 2 WEEKS TO PROCESS AN APPLICATION SOMETIMES LONGER DEPENDING ON VOLUNTEER AVAILABILITY AND NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS RECEIVED SO PLEASE BE PATIENT. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters must understand that each home is different, and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. \nHomes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for:\n1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (ex. a 4 month old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break) \n2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old, to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise.\n3.) Socialization: The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home.\n4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded tenfold, for years to come.\nPlease do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy. Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time consuming and can be expensive. All Dogs Require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well-trained, well socialized dog is more than worth the effort put in to get them there. \n\nOur adoption fee includes spay/neuter, routine shots, rabies, worming, microchipped, heartworm testing and they are on monthly preventative. Visit our website www.luv4k9s.org for more information and to complete an application.\n",

If you are looking for a lap dog and loyal companion, Frankie is your man. \n\nIf you think you would be interested, please complete our no obligation application and we can start the process at www.luv4k9s.org. Select Available Dogs then scroll down to application, complete and submit. \n\nA physical secure fence attached to the residence is a requirement to adopt a dog from our rescue. Invisible fence doesn't meet this requirement. No exceptions.\n\nOur adoption area is primarily OHIO. We will consider KENTUCKY, AND INDIANA AND CERTAIN AREAS OF MICHIGAN, WEST VIRGINIA, AND PENNSYLVANIA if it\u2019s the best fit for the dog.\n\nWE DO NOT SHIP NOR ARRANGE TRANSPORTS.\n\nTHE APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED AND SUBMITTED BEFORE WE CAN START THE PROCESS. \n\nIT CAN TAKE AT LEAST 2 WEEKS TO PROCESS AN APPLICATION SOMETIMES LONGER DEPENDING ON VOLUNTEER AVAILABILITY AND NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS RECEIVED SO PLEASE BE PATIENT. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters must understand that each home is different, and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. \nHomes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for:\n1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (ex. a 4 month old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break) \n2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old, to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise.\n3.) Socialization: The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home.\n4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded tenfold, for years to come.\nPlease do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy. Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time consuming and can be expensive. All Dogs Require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well-trained, well socialized dog is more than worth the effort put in to get them there. \n\nOur adoption fee includes spay/neuter, routine shots, rabies, worming, microchipped, heartworm testing and they are on monthly preventative. Visit our website www.luv4k9s.org for more information and to complete an application.\n",

            "description": "Meet Phineus - in spite of the fact that in his former life someone took a scissor to his ears, this boy is a total lovebug! He is a handsome Doberman mix who's about 4 1/2 years old & weighs 50 pounds! He is a playful pup who will make a great companion! Phineus is up to date on vaccinations and microchipped!! Phineus had a rough start but you would never know it. He loves people and is extremely affectionate and cuddly. He loves to lick your face and loves belly rubs. He loves to be with \"his people\" and wants to be wherever you are. He is happiest when he is right next to you or in your lap.\nHe is very food motivated and loves working on his obedience. Phin has already mastered \"sit\" \"down\" \"paw\" \"rollover\" and \"touch\" (touch my hand with your nose), \"go to bed\" (go in his crate). He is pretty good with \"stay\" \"come\" and \"leave it\"\nOverall he is very eager to please, motivated by treats/praise and respects \"no\".\n\nPhin also LOVES toys. He routinely empties the toy bin and scatters bones and toys on the living room floor. He loves to play fetch with himself and fling his stuffed animals across the room and chase after them. He also likes to rip stuffing out and make a mess. He is such a goof ball!\nPhin is crate trained and house trained. He is great in the car and on leash. He loves going for walks but does pull when he sees other dogs. Phineus needs to be the only pet in the home.\n\nChildren scare Phineus so he should go home to an adult only house.\n\nIf you are looking for the most loving, handsome, fun and silly pup to be the utmost loyal companion, this is the boy for you.\nIf you are interested in meeting with Phineus, be sure to go to our website, EHRDOGS.ORG, and submit an application to adopt or even to foster him!! Don't forget to mention his name, PHINEUS WILSON!!!!",

I also ride wonderfully in the car.  \n\nI love people and would be happiest as your one and only pet.\n\nI'm an indoor dog with great house manners. I also need a large, safely fenced yard (block wall) to run and play in with my family. I am not suited for apartment living. \n\nPlease note: If there are children in the home, they must be over the age of 10 years as they have impulse control.\n\nI am spayed, current on my vaccines, micro chipped as well as licensed for Maricopa County. My adoption fee is $200 which helps cover some of these expenses.\n\nPlease contact Carrie On Rescue if you have any questions about me or if you would like to meet me:\nemail:  carrieonrescuers@hotmail.com\nphone:  (480) 603-7680",

My foster Mom says I'm smart and a joy to have around! I love lots of short walks and then I'm ready to snuggle for a nice nap. I am sight and hearing impaired, yet I find what I need. I'm a quiet little guy, I really never bark. I would do better in a home with no children. Mom says I need a forever loving home with a nice couple that can stay home with me, since I prefer to be with my human. I am loved and well-cared for with my foster family but I am looking for my forever home.\n\nI have had a thorough health examination, I'm microchipped and I will have a dental cleaning prior to adoption. If you have room in your heart and home for me, please complete an adoption application. https://bichonrescueoc.org/adoption-application\n\nIn the struggle to cope with COVID-19 and its effects on our daily life, it has become necessary to suspend our customary adoption approval process. Scheduling your \"Home Safety Evaluation\" and \"Meet and Greet\" presents a significant challenge. If you express an interest in adopting this pup, we will make every effort to make that possible. You will be contacted to schedule a telephone interview and details of the current approval process will be explained.",

He also gets along with children but tries to over power them. We recommend he be in a home with a single person and no children unless in their teens. He definitely needs a chance to be in a furever home! He has been here far too long. \n\nHe is 1 1/2 years old. His current weight is around 45/50 pounds.

Maya is so goofy and loves to be the boss of everyone. She is a indoor dog who is doing great with the crate training and potty training. Maya is so smart and learning her basic commands. She will become your best friend and your shadow!\n\nWe rescued her and bottle fed her at 2 weeks old after someone was selling her on the side of the freeway! I\u2019m so glad she ended up with us! She\u2019s been so fun to foster but now shes ready for her own home. She has all the husky traits and is a talker. Maya has been fully vetted, dewormed, spayed, vaccinated, and microchipped. \n\nWe are looking for a active home locally in Northern California or Sacramento area. Home owners ONLY with a fully fenced in yard that is at least 6 feet tall. No renters or apartments. Must have husky experience! Preferably someone not gone long hours as she\u2019s a needy girl and should would need a home with another doggie playmate. Maya will be a big active breed that will need lots of training and socializing so she\u2019s not for a first time dog owner. No small children as she can easily knock a little one down. \n\nIf you think you are a good fit and are interested in adopting please send us a DETAILED list message about yourself and request a application to fill out. After we review applications we will start setting up interviews and meets. Then home checks with approved applicants. Please be patient with us and we will get back to you at our earliest convenience. Sometimes it can take as least 2-4 weeks. We don\u2019t rush our adoption process and want to find the right match for all our dogs! You can email us at Simbaspawdogrescue@yahoo.com\n",

I am a very sweet boy but I am timid when first meeting new people and new dogs. Once I get to know everybody I am GREAT! I get along with everyone.. dogs, people, everyone. I am a very friendly and active boy giving out lots of kisses and if you ask me for a hug I will give you one. It\u2019s super cute! I know some commands and I love to sleep under the covers with you. I am just looking for that special someone that is gentle and kind and will make me feel loved and safe. I will probably need to meet you twice so I can be familiar with everyone before I move in. After that, I think you will be really happy with me. I don\u2019t even mind being dressed up. That\u2019s how fun and adorable I am! \n\nBirthdate: 4/14/2016\nWeight: 25 lbs.\n\n",

            "description": "Bogart is such a handsome boy, with the beautiful coat of a chocolate lab, and the chunky body of a pit bull terrier. In his case, beauty is more than skin deep -- he's sweet, easy-going and playful, He is a volunteer favorite. Bogart came into the shelter as a lost dog on Oct. 17; he was adopted in early November but the family returned him after he got into an altercation with their cat. He loves people, but apparently not cats, so he needs to go to a no-cat household. He is listed as \"special needs\"  because he  has tested positive for heartworms, and the family that adopts him will need to check with their vet about what treatment he needs. Dogs who are treated for heartworms usually go on to live a happy and playful life; left untreated, heartworms can be fatal. Bogart is about 3 years old and weighs 77 pounds.  He is up-to-date on vaccinations, now neutered and will be microchipped when adopted. Come meet him in Run 85 using ID# 625578. \n\nPlease note, all of the pet listings on Friends of Shelter Animals for Cobb are done by volunteers, not shelter staff. If this pet came in as lost (not an owner surrender), we don't know how they might be with children, other pets, or if house trained. You can bring your pet to the shelter for a meet & greet with your potential new best friend. When calling the shelter about a cat or dog, please use THE ID NUMBER, names are oftentimes made up by volunteers. \n\nThis pet and many others are available for adoption from the Cobb County Animal Shelter 1060 Al Bishop Dr. Marietta, GA 30008, call (770) 499-4136 for more information. Shelter hours are: Tues. - Sun. 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. by appointment only until further notice, CLOSED Mondays & Holidays.",

Both of us are chihuahua mixes; Wendy Lu weighs 13 lbs and Jarvis weighs 17 lbs, but really we are so great together that we may be easier than just one 30 lb dog. It\u2019s a win-win for everyone!

I am housebroken, potty pad trained and I am well behaved. I am a very sweet and gentle girl, shy at first, but only until I know you. Just a bit of patience and kindness to make me feel safe and loved will bring out my adorable personality. To help with the transition to my new forever home, I would like to have 2 meet & greets with you and any doggy friends I may get so that I am already familiar with everyone! After that, watch me shine! I know some commands, I\u2019m fun and I am a pretty quiet girl, only giving out a bark when needed. I love to sleep curled up beside you or in my doggie bed, but mostly beside you.\n\nBirthdate: 4/14/2016\nWeight: 18 lbs.\n\n",

My name is Jimmy Chew,  I am around 2 years old, about 40lbs, already neutered, microchipped & up to date on vaccinations and all set to move right into your home and heart! \n  \nMy friends here describe me as a shy, independent, misunderstood, clever, playful pup. I am most often seen romping in the pens with my jolly ball or taking it on short walks. My friends here think I am funny and a self-entertainer. I am just not always sure how to play with humans, but I love that they like to watch me and laugh. They say I have a lot of puppy-like energy that needs to be channeled into learning and enrichment so that I don't get bored. Give me a rope toy, tennis balls or my favorite jolly ball and watch me go! I am already getting the hang of fun games like \u201ctouch\u201d and \u201cfind it\u201d but I know that there\u2019s still plenty out there that I\u2019m eager to learn. I am hoping that you will want to teach me too.  \n  \nI would love a quiet, calm, adult-only home. I\u2019m nervous meeting new people, so I will need my forever humans to go slow and manage interactions safely. I may not be interested in making new friends, so my people will need to accept me for me and not force anything. I am happiest romping in the yard with my toys and friends. I do enjoy our time together and when I am ready, I will give you many kisses like I\u2019ve grown to love to do with my closest friends here at PAC.\n  \nI\u2019ve also enjoyed making doggie friends at the center and could live with the right dog friend. I love to wrestle and run with my friends and can be a little rough-and-tumble with them, so they have to like that sort of play. With a slow introduction, I might also be able to live with the right kitty roommate - with my type of energy, a cat who is used to this would be best!\n\nSo, if you are interested in more information about me and/or would like to set up a meeting with me to get to know me more, please schedule an appointment here: https://providenceac.org/AdoptADog. My paws are crossed I will see you very soon! \n\nXOXO Jimmy\n\nP.S. Someone is so excited for me to find my fur-ever home, that they have sponsored my adoption fee! That means I can join your family today for FREE! Woohoo!!\"\n\n-------\nDuring your appointment, you will be able to meet a selection of pets in the Kennels or Cattery that day. New pets are arriving daily!\n-------\n\nProvidence Animal Center relies on adoption fees and donations to save pets! Adoption fees vary per pet. To find out this pet\u2019s adoption fee or for more information, please call the Adoption Center with this pet\u2019s ID number.\n\nCan\u2019t adopt? Consider fostering or donating!

Some nice people picked me up and have taken great care of me. I had my puppies the first part of July and have been spayed and will never have to worry about babies again. \n\nI am very sweet and my favorite things are snuggles and kisses. \n\nI need a home without cats, I like to chase them too much. \n\nI have been spayed, I am current on all vaccinations, microchipped and heartworm negative. I just really want a home that will never abandon me like the first people who had me. I just want to love and be loved. My adoption fee is $150. I can go on a home visit with you for 1 week!\n\nIf interested in adopting Emily, send an email to adoptions.spspca@gmail.com\n\nEmily will be at our adoption event on Saturday from 11-2 at 8901 highway 87 building 119!\n",

            "description": "Hi, it's me, Theo! I have been waiting for my forever family for over 10 months here at the shelter! I love to be petted and am not shy about asking for more petting. What can I say? I just want to be with my people. I am always happy to see familiar people, and I'm learning not to jump up when I am too excited. I can be quite the snuggle bug, and I would do best living with someone who can devote a lot of time and attention to me. \n\nI have a lot of energy and I love to run and play, so I would love to have a fenced yard. I'll also be happy to lay down next to you wherever you are-office, bed, couch-anywhere we can snuggle. \n\nI do not like other dogs so we should not go to dog parks or even walk where there are other dogs. So, it's best if I'm an \"only child\" in my forever home-no dogs, cats or children. I really aim to please, so I hope you will have time to train me to perfect my manners. I can't wait to move to my forever home. I hope you are looking for a sweet, lovable guy who just needs attention and patience. I look forward to meeting you soon. Love, Theo!\n\n**I qualify for Foster First which means you may foster me for 14 days prior to adoption to ensure we are a good match!",

She will happily hop in your car as your co-pilot and will keep an eye on the road with her freckled nose at the top of an open window as she sniffs out her next adventure.\nBonnie is housetrained and is respectful of home belongings.  When her family is away running errands she is for just sleeping on the couch, in her cozy doggie bed, or relaxing in her open crate.  She will quietly and patiently wait and then greet you with a wet noseand tail wags when you return.  \nBonnie loves tossing her toys up in the air and then jumping to try to catch them herself. She also loves a super good game of tug of war and fetch.  \nBonnie's real super power though is her ability to snooze anywhere.  This cute couch potato loves her naps and snoozes any chance she can!  You can even hear her cute snores and little barks as she imagines running after dream squirrels.  \nBonnie walks nicely on her leash and is learning how to properly greet her neighbors and fellow pups.  She has learned \"sit\" and \"wait\" and will need continued training but responds well to treats, so she'll be quick learning other commands.\nApply today to meet Bonnie and make her a part of your family.\n\n All dogs are spayed/neutered, brought up to date on vaccinations, micro-chipped and heartworm tested prior to the adoption.\n\nPlease see our website for more information on our adoption policies: www.pittiestoprescue.org and complete an application at: http://www.pittiestoprescue.org/adoption-application/\n\nAdoption fee $375.00",

Please read all about her below. \n\nAdoption coordinator Kathy\n\nMeet AllyMae! She\u2019s 2.5 yrs old and weighs about 60 lbs. She came into rescue as part of a dog cruelty seizure and was kept in a 4x8 pen in very unsanitary conditions. She is a high energy dog and is very true to her breed. She will bay loudly when she catches a scent. She needs a cat free home.  She\u2019s house trained and ok in a crate and on a leash, but must be walked with a thick rope type leash as if she bolts after a scent she can snap a thinner leash. A fenced yard is best, but her current foster is managing her without one. She can likely climb a chain link fence. She\u2019ll need plenty of exercise. She is not a good fit for an apartment. Because of her loud coonhound bark, she\u2019d do best in a neighborhood where houses are spaced a good distance apart or a more rural setting. She loves other dogs, so a home with another dog to play with is a must.  Her current foster is enjoying her very much. He describes her as loving, easy going and very trainable. He said she loves people, other dogs and enjoys long walks and playing. She is a GREAT dog for someone who loves a hound dog!! Adoption fee $300. \n\n\n\n\nPlease complete an online APPLICATION if you wish to adopt.  Forever Home Rescue New England is a 501(c)3  non-profit organization. We are a network of foster homes in the South and the New England area. THERE IS NO SPECIFIC SHELTER LOCATION. If you wish to meet our dogs, you must first be approved by going through our application and screening process. Forever Home Rescue suggests obedience training for all puppies and dogs. All dogs are up to date on their shots, dewormed and spayed or neutered. Vet fees, transport fee and New England quarantine fees ARE INCLUDED in each dog's adoption fee. Also, any dogs older than pups--even if they are not marked housetrained in their posting---usually housetrain within a day or two, because most are used to living outside in the south and will prefer to do their business outdoors. Our dogs and pups are best suited for families with children 5 yrs old and up. If you are approved to adopt, please submit the $100 deposit by clicking on our rescue's name in this posting (Forever Home Rescue New England--in purple) which will bring you to a new page with the deposit link at the bottom.  STOP! If you have not been notified of your approval status do not make a deposit.",

Our phone number is 618-665-3005. The shelter is open to the public 1-3 Monday-Saturday. Sundays we are open 1-4 to the public. If those times don't work, please call to set up a time to visit.\n\nThe typical adoption fee for dogs is $150. It includes vaccination, deworming , spay/neuter, heartworm testing on dogs of age and microchipping, which is now mandatory by state law. Some dogs we discount to as little as $50 due to sponsorship. Some dogs we ask a higher adoption fee, which helps us recoup expenses on heartworm treatment on other dogs.\n\nAll cats are spayed/neutered/vaccinated/flea treated/dewormed and microchipped prior to adoption. Cat adoption fees range from $60-$100. We spay/neuter/microchip/vaccinate and deworm all kittens and cats, prior to adoption. Our shyer/less adoptable cats are classed as \"barn cats\" and are free with a completed/approved barn cat application, which can be found on our website.\n\nFor updates on adoption events and more pics of pets available, go to our website, www.claycountyshelter.com or look for us on Facebook.",

Brinda Lu will make an excellent family addition as she is already potty trained. She was adopted as a young pup, but her owner became ill and could no longer care for her so she is once again looking for a home. She still has a ton of puppy energy so she would love a family that is active. If you are willing to put in the time she is sure to be the perfect dog for years to come!",

She is a five year old, 45 lb Australian shepherd mix, with soft luxurious fur, and beautiful half-and-half face markings.\n\nBecause Ellie is a \"working\" breed, she has different needs than an average dog. She requires confident, calm leadership. She will definitely do best with an experienced owner. Familiarity with her breed's characteristics is a plus. She is pack-oriented, and needs a leader to help her understand her status, especially where children and other pets are concerned. Without consistent, positive training, she will not acclimate well to a household with other pets or children. Because of this, she probably needs to go to a home with no children. She does well in her foster home, so experienced owners with pets can be considered. Ellie currently lives with a non-dominant dog and a large, dog savvy cat. She is learning to be respectful of them, and is doing extremely well, but it has required a fair amount of effort and training. With time, Ellie is learning to relax and just enjoy being part of the family, but it has been an adjustment for her, and for her pet siblings. Ellie is extremely intelligent and learns quickly, which is typical of her breed. She just needs someone who understands how to communicate with her, and can show her what is expected of her.\n\nEllie generally walks well on a loose leash, but her protective instincts kick in if a person, other dog, or car passes. She is particularly reactive to delivery trucks! She is working on this, and will need someone to continue this training with her. \n\nContrary to her breed, Ellie is not terribly high energy, and does not require a lot of exercise. She does require mental stimulation, so some shorter walks throughout the day would work well for her. Training sessions, play time and puzzles will also help. A fenced yard would be a plus. Ellie does sometimes dig, but it's usually to dig up a tasty grub, rather than an effort to escape. Ellie can be trusted to be left alone indoors without being destructive, but she is currently being secluded in a separate bedroom, as she needs to be supervised with other household pets. Ellie does occasionally bark at outside noises, people, etc. but it has lessened over time, as she realizes that she does not need to be in charge.\n\nEllie does not show guarding around her food dish, but she instinctively shows a lot of interest around food in general. Her new family will need to establish clear rules with Ellie about food. She is being taught \"Down/Stay\" during family mealtimes, and is doing very well with it. \n\nIn the right home, Ellie is a joyful, goofy girl. She absolutely loves her toys, going for walks, snuggling, belly rubs, and sitting outside in the sun. She does not tend to \"herd\" people as many dogs of her breed. One of her charming quirks is that she follows closely behind people as they walk around the home, usually with a toy in her mouth, ever so lightly pressed against the back of the person's legs. It's really adorable! Ellie is also talkative when she needs something. She will have a \"chat\" with you if she needs a potty break, and can give a sassy little bark or grumble if she's asked to do something she's not a fan of.\n\nEllie is spayed, microchipped, fully vetted, and up-to-date on vaccinations and monthly flea/tick and heart worm preventatives. If you have questions about Ellie May, you can email her foster at Deb@pawsforlifenc.org. If you think Ellie May is a good match for you, you can fill in an online application for here at www.pawsforlifenc.org. \n\nAs part of Ellie Mae's $250 adoption fee, she is spayed, microchipped, up to date on vaccines, and current on her monthly flea/tick and heartworm preventatives. Ellie Mae is heartworm negative. If you have questions about this sweet girl, you can email Dogteam@pawsforlifenc.org. If you wish to adopt Ellie Mae, you can fill in an online application for her under the Adopt a Pet Tab on our website: www.pawsforlifenc.org.",

This is a 4 week program and her ideal adopter should be close enough to Elkridge MD to attend the post program training for a smooth transition .\n\nUpdate : the lack of socialization and basic training that all puppies should have is evident in Harley's behavior.\n\nShe is very sweet with people but new places , car rides etc are frightening to her . She is in a doggie day care but can play too hard with smaller dogs .\n\nHarley's ideal adopter will some one experienced with German\nShepherd dogs or similar herding /guardian breeds and have done training with their prior dogs.\n\nHarley is\ncurrently in a Board and Train with a local trainer to help prepare her for adoptive family.\n\nNo small children or small dogs or cats , please .\n\nIf you are not yet approved to adopt from All Shepherd Rescue, please fill out our online application at www.allshepherdrescue.com.

She about 2 years old and has spent her life living outside, somehow she is still so affectionate and sweet. Not only is she dog friendly, but she is good with cats too! She is on multiple meds currently and combined with good nutrition, we are hopeful her skin will heal and her hair will regrow in no time! The hair loss is not contagious and is a combination of being outside in the sun and dirt with environmental and possible food allergies along with some fungal aspects. She is being treated from all directions! Here is a link to more photos and videos of Lainey! https://photos.app.goo.gl/yEVfg5rA9rZPgsBb9",

            "description": "Norma Jean is a 10 year old yellow lab mixed with a chihuahua. She weighs about 25 lbs and is super sweet and gentle.  She would be considered a special needs baby. When she was brought into the shelter, she mostly likely had been hit by a car.  She had full hip and hind end X-rays done and she is in perfect health structurally, no arthritis.  She also had a recent blood panel and she has the blood of a puppy.  The vet believes that she has a neurological problem that causes her to not always know right away when she is dedicating.  She sometimes is able to run outside and other times she can\u2019t make it.  Luckily, she doesn\u2019t make a mess at all and her foster says it\u2019s super easy to just pick up.  Norma Jean loves all dogs and cats.  She would love to cuddle with you or relax on her bed.  She enjoys resting in the sunny backyard and snacking on yummy treats.  Norma is spayed, micro chipped and up to date on all shots.\nhttp://www.angelsinfurdogrescue.com/adoption-application/\n",

She is about a year old, maybe a bit older. she is red heeler/great pyrenees mix. She is about 70-80lbs and full of love. We rescued her recently from an abusive home where she was living outside and being mistreated. We love her very much and would love to keep her, but our other dog is a quarter her size and their play gets rough to the point of danger for the little one. She has her fair share of behavioral and emotional issues which we are slowly working through. She would do well with other big dogs or a solo dog household as she loves having attention on her. Being working breeds, a job would suit her as well. She loves being on the mountains and is right at home on a long hike and in the water. We are trying to find her a proper home where she can get the exercise, room, and attention she needs. I can be contacted via phone or text at 847-287-5113, or via email at gtittle35@gmail.com 11/29/20 9:08 PM",

            "description": "Meet Cooper. This guy was rescued off a chain by one of our volunteers. He was allowed indoors as a small puppy and then let roam for awhile. The last few months he spent his life on a chain. Thankfully, his family had no issue surrendering him to us. We were told he is a Lab/Husky mix and that he was born in Feb 2020. He had his first vet visit and weighed 63 lbs. Cooper is a very sweet boy and has made great progress since he\u2019s been with his foster. He does have some Husky traits. He can be a little weary with strangers and need a little patience. We have learned if you don\u2019t pay attention to him and let him come to you at his own pace he does much better. He also can be vocal at times especially if other dogs are. He also has some labby traits. He\u2019s goofy and has no idea of his size. He\u2019s also playful and super loving. Both breeds are energetic as is he. He enjoys playing with toys, other dogs, running in the yard and taking walks. He does well with other dogs but proper intros are a must. He is house and kennel trained. He loves his fosters grandkids. He loves toys, cuddling on the couch and snoozing in the bed with you. He\u2019s walking great on a harness and his foster is working hard to break his jumping when excited. He\u2019s very eager to please and will make a great pet for someone willing to put in the time with this boy. He is utd, hw neg (tested below detectable levels) and neutered! \n\nAll dogs have a $175 adoption fee which includes vet check, age appropriate shots (atleast 2 sets for puppies), dewormer, heartworm test (if over 6 months), rabies (if atleast 16 weeks) and spay/neuter! Puppies will be altered before adoption. All rescues and shelters practice pediatric spay and neuter. This is essential in our rescue efforts and it is a policy that we will stick by. All dogs over 8 weeks and 2 pounds will be altered before adoption. There are no exceptions to this rule on all healthy and adoptable dogs. \n\nPuppies/Dogs that are not available for adoption due to vetting not being complete can be reserved with an approved application and a non refundable $50 deposit. This deposit is applied to your adoption fee and the remaining $125 is due at pick up.\n\nWags and Whiskers is an all-volunteer rescue. We also have full-time jobs and Families. We will try to answer all questions and applications in a timely manner. Please be patient and bear with us . Do not contact Parkway Animal Hospital as they are a vet clinic and can not answer questions on behalf of Wags and Whiskers. All questions and comments must go directly through the rescue. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION\n\nhttps://form.jotform.us/70898112177159\n",

But now its this girls turn to be undoubtedly and forever loved!!\n\nShe does great with other dogs but needs very slow introductions (usually a couple days) as she just needs to learn boundaries and play styles with other dogs. \n\nShes a snuggle bug and only wants to be next to you at all times. On walks she likes to zig zag but shes not a puller. She does think she's the conquerer of all squirrels, therefore a 6ft fence is mandatory for this girl. Ramen is super sweet and we can't wait for you to meet her. \n\nShe is a pit mix, therefore please do not apply if living in an apartment or a breed restricted city. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit our website and complete an adoption application at www.elpasocountycanine.org/available-dogs",

            "description": "Have you ever seen a miniature German shepherd? Once you meet Felix you can check that off your list! Because at a whole 30 pounds, this 3yo looks like a shrunken German Shepherd Dog!\n\nWhat Felix lacks in size he makes up for in personality! This goofball wants to be your own personal shadow - following you everywhere, giving you kisses when you bend down, picking up food you accidentally dropped. Hes the perfect sidekick because hes right by your side and doesnt want to miss out on any of the action. In his foster home he has thrived with structure and routine and has become the ultimate cuddle buddy!\n\nIn order to enjoy this side of Felix, he will need an adopter(s) who is extremely patient and understand that building a relationship with Felix will take time! Rome wasnt built in a day, nor will Felixs trust happen overnight. Felix is slow to trust and warm up to new people but oh boy, if youre fortunate enough to get on his good side he will shower you with love and affection! In fact, hell shower you with the love and affection he seems to have been denied prior to having been rescued!\n\nFelix would do best in a home that could continue to reinforce his training. Felix is a graduate of Golden Heart Canines board and train program which means hes got the skills to loose leash walk and knows commands like sit, wait, down, stay, and place. He has also recently learned how to shake!\n\nWhile on a leash, Felix walks with a loose leash and loves to be outside! Sometimes he gets distracted by bunnies and squirrels but a quick correction and he comes back to the expected behavior. He would be an excellent hiking partner too! In his Texas foster home, Felix was taken on daily runs. A walk seems to tire him out just fine though so no need for only marathon runners to apply.\n\nFelix does appreciate slower introductions to other dogs but once theyre buddies, theres no stopping play time! Felix loves to play chase and tag with other dogs and he likes to boop other dogs. Weve tested Felix with bigger dogs, smaller dogs, mellow dogs, hyper dogs, and puppies and hes done great with all of them - he just likes a proper doggie handshake before jumping in to play. We would encourage Felix be adopted into a home with another confident dog because Felix warms up to people significantly quicker if he is around dogs who model good interactions with people.\n\nFelix is crate trained, potty trained, and is overall a very quiet and well behaved dog. Felix LOVES his crate and he can frequently be found sleeping in his crate with the door wide open. He enjoys the company of the other dogs in his foster home and frequently initiates playtime with the dogs. When his foster siblings are tired out and refuse to play anymore, Felix will grab a toy from the toy bin and entertain himself by throwing his toy in the air and trying to catch it.\n\nFelix likely hasn't spent much time inside a home prior to his foster home because things like the dishwasher running and the toilet flushing are a little scary. Because hes easily startled we do not recommend a home with kids for Felix.\n\nHe's been working on his confidence and learning how to dog by playing with toys and going to breweries but hes still got a ways to go. Even though Felix has been visiting breweries, hes been muzzled and in controlled situations, but this is not where Felix thrives. Felix will thrive in a quiet home without a lot of action OR in a home that understands that meeting new people can and does stress him out, so hell need to be crated or muzzled when new people come to his home.\n\nFelix is a fantastic dog and just needs someone to take a chance on him. We know Felixs forever human(s) is around the corner and we cant wait to help him find it!\n\n**Please note that due to Felix's need to build trust and relationships over time, he will require 5+ meet and greets before he can be added to your home.**\n\n**Homeownership required**\n\nFelix makes his bed: https://youtu.be/8b-036QW1XA\n\nPlaying with Forrest: https://youtu.be/PQClb5RvaNA\n\n*HOME OWNERSHIP REQUIRED!*\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

This entire bunch was under socialized, never walked on leash, and had a hard time navigating the outside world. Our hearts absolutely broke and we made it our mission to get them into foster care where they could be surrounded by love and dedicated people who would help them learn to be successful companions, but more importantly to be dogs. Two such foster families stepped up to be those people!\n\nBoba's foster family is working to help build his confidence, and lessen his anxieties as well as helping him learn the manners he was never taught.\n\nEDUCATION:\n* Sit\n* Paw\n* Touch\n* Is starting to get place and down\n* Doesn't beg at the dinner table\n* Can play on his own\n* He does very well being left out in a gated area in the house\nACTIVITIES THIS CUTIE ENJOYS:\n* Treats: cod skins, peanut butter, hot dogs, Zuke's training treats, chicken\n* Food: he loves to eat!\n* Toys: loves toys!\n* Walks: he enjoys long walks in the woods and is excellent on leash\n* Running in the yard\n* Training sessions\n* Snuggling\n* Loves being in the car and he travels well\n* Hanging out on restaurant patios with people\n* Ear, chin, and belly scratches\n* Zoomies\n* He enjoys attention and affection\n* Sleeping in people beds and on couches\nSKILLS:\n* Dogs: friendly, excited, he's a little awkward with dogs when playing\n* Kids: friendly but we recommend kids 10+ years or older\n* People: friendly, excited, warms up to women more quickly\n* Cats: unknown\n\nCHALLENGES:\n* Learning to love his crate but he does great when he is gated off instead\n* Can be mouthy when excited but settles down\n* He has been known to jump\n* Has some separation anxiety\n* Recommend a home where someone is home most of the time\n* He will follow you everywhere\n* We recommend a fenced yard\n* Not a fan of baths\n* He seeks affirmations and attention all the livelong day",

I do really well on long, leisurely walks with my foster mom everyday. I love to explore the outdoors and walk very nicely. I am easy to handle as I only weigh 41 lbs. I am about 9 months old and I'm house trained, crate trained and can follow simple commands. After my walk, I love to play with my Nylabone, get ear scratches and belly rubs and then take an afternoon nap. I'm really easy to get along with as I love everybody I meet! I'm not overly active like most Red Heeler mixes. I'm more of a hound dog who would love to keep you company. If you'd like to adopt me, please fill out an application at Ruffhouserescue.org and be patient as it can take a few weeks to process. I will patiently be waiting to meet you!",

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: 10/10/2020\nReason for being in rescue: stray\nFoster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SC\nSpecial Needs? none\nWeight: 15.5 lbs and growing. We expect Stacy will be between 25-30 pounds when she is full grown.\nHeight: 9 in\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes, Stacy Dirk was spayed on 10/20/2020. She is ready for her forever home.\n\nAdoption Fee: $200\n\nFence needed? Yes\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Stacy Dirk is a happy, very active puppy. She would be best in a home with another active dog and someone home during the day for physical and mental exercise. Stacy is learning the ropes of being a pet, but needs continued training on basic manners, house training, and walking on a leash. She would be wonderful for mature children (no children under 10 as she is very much a puppy and still chews... puppy teeth are sharp). She needs a fenced yard where she can run out her energy and play ball with her family every day. Stacy Dirk would love to be your hiking buddy!\n\nWhat is my personality like? Stacy Dirk was abandoned behind a convenience store. Thankfully, the manager on duty is a dog lover and scooped this baby girl up. We cannot imagine how or why someone could abandon a young girl as full of personality and life as Stacy Dirk. But her past will not define her future.\n\nStacy Dirk is your classic happy, very active puppy. She loves everyone she wants to meet and is always up for an adventure. She's living in a foster home with other dogs that are small and large and does well with them. We don't recommend a home with cats as Stacy is just too curious and energetic for your average cat.\n\nStacy Dirk is learning all sorts of things in her foster home. First up was crate training. She's done very well with that and sleeps in her crate quietly at night. She is learning to walk on a leash, though she sometimes think it's a chew toy while she's walking. She knows basic command (sit and down) and is working on the leave it command. She absolutely loves toys, loves people, and is wide open energy all the time.\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Very friendly\n\nOther tips and tidbits: Stacy Dirk's estimated birthday is 6/10/2020\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

            "description": "This is Hugo Hugo is a good boy but not suitable for a home with small animals or children under 16, He needs a dominant assertive owner who will be able to teach him the manners he so desperately needs. He knows sit, but is an extremely high energy dog, he would need lots of exercise and would not be suitable for an apartment setting. We were lucky enough to get some insight from his previous adopter and this is what she had to say: he's very sweet and he's so nice, but he does have a lot of energy. I would say he really likes pets and being on the couch. Couches are his favorite and he'll gladly rest on your lap if you let him. He has a nipping problem but he doesn't mean to hurt. He enjoyed Kraft Cheese. We gave him squeaky toys and those were his favorites and so were Kong toys, especially if you put peanut butter on them. Running is good for him and he knows how to sit. I would say give him a harness instead of a leash because he will pull. He loves people, but he didn't seem to be a fan of little kids. He's a quick learner, very sweet. And the sun was his favorite thing to sleep in. We've noticed on walks when he can see his own image, he didn't like looking at him. And windy days, when something would flap loudly, it would startle him. Watch the coffee mugs around his wagging tail, though, that's powerful. Hugo is one of the dogs that has been at our shelter for the longest, although we love him we are so desperate to see him in his forever home where he can get the training, excercise and the love that he so much longs for. If you are interested in Hugo please call our adoptions line at 301-780-7201.",

He knows basic commands, walks well on a leash, waits to go through doors and for his food.  Playing fetch with Titan is great exercise for you and him.  He loves to be with his people on all your adventures. His antics when he is playing alone are hysterical.  He loves to play in the grass and roll around.  He may make a great running partner.  Titan isn't a barker unless he is not around his people.  \n\nIf you are interested in giving Titan a loving, forever home please go to https://www.sngsr.org/steps-to-adopting.html and fill out an application today! \n\nThe rescue suggests obedience training for all puppies and dogs.\n\nIf you have any questions please email us at sierranevadagsr@outlook.com\nor visit our website www.sngsr.org. You can also see what we are up to day to day by following our Facebook page at Sierra Nevada German Shepherd Rescue.\n\nThank you for considering adopting a rescue dog and supporting Sierra Nevada German Shepherd Rescue in our efforts to save lives!\n\n",

I was given to a shelter in Gallup N.M. when I was pregnant with my babies. AARF Animal Rescue took me in and I gave birth to 8 beautiful puppies. I'd be best as an only dog, I love people, I'll crawl in your lap if you let me, and lay by your side all day. I would love to be in a family that is active and loves to hike. You will need to commit to getting me some training, as my first family didn't do this and I tend to chew things that aren't mine.  If you are interested in meeting me please call the rescue and set up a time and day to come out. 928-925-7219. A home check is required before I can be adopted.",

            "description": "Meet Domino, a 77lb American Bulldog/Pitbull Mix believed to be around 5-6 years old. Domino is a total sweetheart who makes any day better by just being his goofy self! He loves his people, walks, naps, and bringing you his toys when you come home. Domino was believed to be a victim of a dog attack as his bite wounds were consistent with a gnarly dog on dog encounter where he did not have the upper paw. His foster family believes that's the reason why he is extremely cautious of big dogs. Although he wouldn't mind being in home where he is your one and only, following a slow and proper introduction, Domino does great with smaller submissive dogs. He also sometimes gets overwhelmed with fast, quick movements, so an easy-going adult home with no children will make him happiest. Despite his size, Domino is a true gentleman on leash, who makes many human friends on his walks. He is a super quick learner who is house broken and crate trained, and already knows several commands.. He has also learned to politely wait for his food. To see Domino being the best boy in his foster home, follow him @spikemontgomerythepibble on Instagram!\n\nThis animal's adoption fee is $200",

I like lay on the rug in the lobby and tare the tennis balls to shreds and then get a new one. I have basic listening skills, sometimes I ignore the humans when they are trying to get me to listen. They always want me to do things that are boring like get in my kennel. I always sit when they bring me my food. I'll do just about anything if your gonna give me food. One time I got out of my kennel and followed one of my humans to the dumpster and helped her take the garbage out and then I followed her back to the building and went back inside without a leash.

She can live with another dog, but would rather be an only dog so she can have all of the attention. People are her favorite thing, and treats. She is great in the house, doesn't need to be crated, she won't chew up your phone, or shoes. Just good, calm company.\n\nThank you for your interest in one of our Hero Babies!  Before inquiring, we thought it was important to share a few of our policies.  We do require that all of your current dogs and cats are current on vaccines and spayed/neutered.  We do not have a shelter, and are a foster-home based organization.  Other than meeting our babies at events, we do require that you have an approved adoption application to schedule a meet and greet.  You can fill out an adoption application on our website, www.herorescue.org/adopt.",

            "description": "\u2026...unfortunately we can not adopt or transport to Canada due to border closings. Please revisit our Petfinders site once the borders open! Thanks for understanding!\n\nRowdy was found abandoned with two other dogs in a small town in Louisiana.  He was estimated to be 3 to 4 months old at the time.  He is very loving, loyal, and playful.  He plays rough though, and it is recommended he be in an one dog family and/or socialized training with other dogs to learn to play. He plays with other dogs at our rescue currently but very ruff which is how he got his name Ruff Rowdy!!!! LOL.  Honestly with time and training we think he will learn to play at a more acceptable level.\n\n He is leash walked trained but still a high energy puppy who needs to be taught some manners. He would do better in a home with no kids or older kids in high school.  He gets nervous around loud noises and lets face it, kids are loud!!\n\nAt his foster home before coming to the shelter, he was use to being crated at night and free to roam the large fenced in yard during the day.  He was not quite house trained but learning! He really enjoys running long distances, smelling new things and water!! I think he would be great addition to an active family or couple who have an adventurous taste! He loves to run fast and hard and then he comes back happy and panting!! If you think Ruff Rowdy would be the perfect fit for you and your family, please email us at LongJ1003@aol.com and Katybug6067@gmail.com. Thanks for adopting to adopt!!!",

He likes to sit in your lap, go for long walks, and dance on his back legs! It\u2019s soooo cute!!\n\nHe is not ideal for apartment living as he does have a very loud, beagle-y bark when left alone. He loves to give high tens and sit in your lap! He\u2019s such a goofy, sweet boy!\n\nAdoption fee is $350 and includes neuter, vaccinations and microchip.\nAll information on our adoption process can be found at LittleWolfRescue.org\nIf this listing is still up, then he is still available!",

She needs a quiet and gentle family with dog savvy kids no younger than 15, if any at all. She will bark when she's upset, so often at strangers and when she feels left out. She wouldn't do well in apartment or multi-family style home as the noise would bother the neighbors, and noisy neighbors would bother her. She's especially scared of strangers touching her, and even of more trusted people picking her up. She may nip when panicked. She bullies cats but does well with sweet and friendly dogs closer to her size that don't mind a little sass. She is housebroken and loves to go for walks; they've been the best way to bond with her. She struggles with stairs and can only do a few steps. This combined with her fear of being picked up means there should be no necessary steps for her to climb in her new home.\n\nKey Notes:\n-6-year old spayed female.\n-Chihuahua mix.\n-16 pounds and slightly overweight.\n-Surrendered by extended family to a rescue in Alabama when her elderly owner passed.\n-Experience with timid dogs needed.\n-No apartments or multi-family homes.\n-Okay with dog-savvy kids 15 and up.\n-Should not live with cats.\n-Good with friendly and submissive dogs with the exception of being good with her long time friend, Nacho.\n-No stairs she will need to climb.\n-No more than 8 hours alone a day.\n-Low-medium energy; loves walks and the occasional run, but happy to laze around.\n-Does not like to be picked up; will tolerate after she learns to trust you.\n-Will bark when upset (at strangers, when she feels ignored, etc.).\n-Housebroken and good on leash; loves walks!\n\n--THE ADOPTION PROCESS--\nIf you are interested in adopting this animal, please submit an online application. Applications will be reviewed as received. If in our opinion a pet is a good candidate for you, an adoption\u00a0counselor will contact you to schedule a zoom chat. If you do not hear from us it simply means either the animal has been adopted or we have not received the right pet for you. The application process is at no charge to you and only needs to be completed once as all applications will be kept on file.\n\nOnline applications can be found here: www.buddydoghs.com/forms\n\nCheck out our FAQ for answers to most questions here: www.buddydoghs.com/faq\n\nAdopters must be at least 21 years of age and a Massachusetts resident.",

While not all are in the immediate area, once we have processed and approved your application, we will move the dog to our adoptive area for you to meet, greet and hopefully adopt. Sometimes we will have more than one application on a dog. That does not mean it automatically goes to another family but you should be aware of the fact that until you are approved and set up for the meet/greet.. the dog could get adopted by another applicant.\nWho would love a quiet afternoon with you gardening in the shire and be ready on a moments notice to accompany you on a grand adventure? Samwise, of course! Sam is earnest, rustic almost, and he wears his heart of gold on his sleeve. Sam will look to you to be his leader and he will be the secret strength that carries you though even the toughest of days. His resilient spirit has allowed him to travel from humble beginnings with no place of his own to winning the hearts of the rescue volunteers who have been teaching him the ways of people and the comforts of home. Imagine the joy of never having to feel guilty knowing that your best friend would rather to be home with you than at the dog park.\nSam is now looking for his forever place in the country with a fenced yard, quiet surroundings, and an experienced dog lover who prefers the road less traveled for times when a hike is the order of the day. How much fun will it will be walking the solitary back roads on a Tuesday morning at 10 when everyone else is well... too busy to seize the warm sunny moment you'll share.\nSam is housebroken, crate trained, knows sit, and certainly knows breakfast and dinner routines. He enthusiastically loves to lean-in and he is a first class snuggler who will not be shy about joining you on the sofa to savor a movie or three. Sam is ready for the unconditional love of a friend who will teach him even more about the ways of people. In return he will promise to do his very best to listen to your stories, his eyes meeting yours in agreement that life's journey is difficult and worthy and fun and glorious but not all at once. All the while Sam will share with you the rewards of investing in love.\nFENCE REQUIREMENT: Sam is going to need a yard with a privacy fence that is at least 4 foot high.\n\nIf you are interested in Sam, please contact:\nrorrcanine@gmail.com\n*** Click here to sponsor this dog! ***",

            "description": "Stella Rose, what a pretty little girl! she is, young was 1 yr old on Nov. 5th 2020.  She is a whopping 14 lbs 6 oz!! full of love, excitement and energy.  Stella is very playful, good with all people, and children.  She is well behaved and good mannered. We prefer a home with no other animals but a home with a young MALE dog to play with her is a possibility. \n\nApartment life is not the right fit for this girl, she is like a watch dog and will bark at strange noises and people to let you know someone is too close to your home. Right now she spends too much time in her crate because her mom works and the other dogs she lives with are seniors and they don't want to be bothered. A fenced yard would be great too, but not mandatory.  Stella is very much like a JRT, she is full of energy, very playful but does like to cuddle too. \n\nStella has what is called dry eye in her left eye.  It does not require surgery.\nIt requires eye drops twice daily and  Artificial Tears should be done as often as possible.\n\nReach out to AFEW if you would like more information.  Her adoption fee is $300.  She is spayed and has all her vaccinations.\n\nNote: AFEW reserves the right to deny any application that is deemed unfit or unsuitable for the animal. Please be aware that our animal adoptions are NOT on a first come- first serve basis. Our sole purpose is to find the best possible home for the animals that fall under our care.\n\nComplete an online application at http://afewpets.org/machform/view.php?id=4 and email it to afew_pets@comcast.net\n\nA healthy pet is a happy pet!
