            "description": "**SPECIAL NEEDS - EXTREMELY SHY **\n\nMale Border Collie Mix: 50 lbs\n\nBorn around May 2016 and arrived at TVR April 23, 2019\n\nKids: 16 and over Dogs:  Yes, REQUIRED   Cats: Unknown\n\nLinus is a very special boy who will need a patient, quiet, and loving home to help him come out of his shell and gain confidence. In his first couple of years this bashful boy was not often exposed to every day life situations, if at all and perhaps he was even a stray at some point. \n\nSince arriving at TVR, he has become more confident and secure in his surroundings. He genuinely loves to play with the other dogs and feels much safer in their presence and with a pack. He is becoming more comfortable when interacting with people but it still takes a long time for him warm up to new people. In spite of his fears, he does know how to walk on leash and seems to be reasonably house-trained although accidents can occur during any new and/or stressful situation.\n\nLinus belongs in a home with at least one other dog who is super friendly and confident to take the lead and show him the way. He will benefit from an outgoing counterpart that will help him find his courage. His human can help soothe Linus by brushing him (he loves it) and filling his dog bed with cozy blankets before tucking him into bed. \n\nWe are not 100% sure what incident occurred to make the world an intimidating place for Linus, but we know in our hearts that with the right person by his side and the security of a home he will learn to feel safe and at ease. He will finally be able to take a breath and live a happy peaceful life which he deserves. \n\nAre you ready to give this sweet, gentle and shy boy the home he has been waiting so patiently for?\n\n*HEARTWORM UPDATE: Linus has completed his heart worm treatment and is ready to go to his new home! It is very important for Linus to be kept on a monthly Heartworm preventative (such as Heartgard Plus) and not miss a dose. Linus will need to be taken to the adopters primary vet in 9 months (approximately June 10th, 2021) to be retested for Heartworm Disease.\n\nLinus is available for adoption through Their Voice Rescue (www.theirvoicerescue.org). If you are interested in Linus, please contact them by email (adopt@theirvoicerescue.org) or by phone (540) 497-3562.",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Cheerio and Im a 1 year old Pittie mix with a tall order. Im a very special boy looking for a very specific home. I know, I know that people arent lining up out the door to meet a Black furred Pittie, with a very crooked smile like myself but I promise Im a sweet, lovable guy with lots of potential in me. \n\nI really like other dogs and would really like to have another one in my forever home. I have some behavioral issues and separation anxiety. Because of my past, I have a hard time trusting new people right away. You see, when I was a pup, humans werent very nice to me. One even broke my jaw before they dumped me off at the vet to euthanize me. Thats where the nice people at ARAR stepped in and saved me and when I met my foster mom. My foster mom says Ive come such a long way from the broken puppy I once was but when I look in the mirror, I look just as handsome to me! I do have a crooked grin, because of the way my jaw healed but that just means i stand out from the rest of the dogs around, and yes, I did win best smile at puppy school. Because of my anxiety, I am on medication that I will need for the rest of my life. Along with visits to see my favorite doctor, the behaviorist, every 6 months, but its okay, i really like her, she gives me lots of treats and cookies and tells me what a good boy i am! I would require a dog savvy, and patient pet parent, who can financially afford to take me to these appointments. Someone who would like to learn and grow with me, after all who doesnt love growth on all levels?? My foster mom says that Meets and intros would be very slow because it takes a while for me to trust strangers. I cant live with kids or be around them-they scare me. Im also not a fan of big crowds. I guess you could say Im in introverted guy, so maybe an introverted person would be my perfect pair. I am crate and potty trained. I love my crate and use it for comfort and when left alone. I know just about every trick under the sun and love to learn new things! I am a higher energy, 65 lb boy that loves to play with squeaky toys and balls. I love to go swimming and am very good at it. Im a good walker for the most part. After a fun day with adventures and play time there is nothing I love more than snuggling up with my bonded people and relaxing, And I make the most perfect little spoon. \n\nIve been waiting for my perfect person to come along and rescue me for quite some time now. Lots of foster friends have come and gone, while I patiently wait for my turn. Think we could be MFEO? (Made for each other ) then contact the rescue today!",

Cholula was a ridiculously adorable puppy at Best Friends who grew into a ridiculously handsome boy. He can be a little shy with new people and because of his size and nervousness he wasn't a good fit for the home he was in, but in the right home he would be an endless source of entertainment and fun.\n\nHe still has the energy of a young dog so he would do best in an active home. He can be anxious around other dogs so would need to have an experienced owner who would be willing to supervise him until he is comfortable. Once he is settled though he is a giant goofball and just wants to run, play with his dog friends and hang out with his people. One look at him and you can tell he is truly one of a kind so if he is the kind for you he would love to be your one!",

            "description": "Hope came from a hoarding situation when over 80 animals were surrendered to a shelter. The surrender of so many put all occupants of that shelter in jeopardy and the staff worked feverishly to get rescue for all of the new intakes.\n\nAlthough all dogs were so frightened after being torn from the only home they'ed know for much of their lives, not one dog showed any aggression......just fear.\n\nOur Ms. Hope was one of the better, but will still require a special family who can help her get beyond the fear she now feels. Patience and love are the order. She is so sweet and so wanting to know the love of a human it will tear your heart out to see her be so scared that she tries to hide....and, yet when you have a break through and she trusts you, you will feel elated and wishing for more. She's been with a trainer for some decompression time while being in a home environment with him. She's in a TLC program with a great foster family now and is doing very well.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nRecently our trainer had her over for a few days boarding when her foster family went away and he said: \"Placing Hope is like placing a special needs dog. She is special needs. And her behavior will need to be managed for an undetermined period of time. What we know, factually, is that she doesn't have an aggressive bone in her body. She eats well. She crates well. She is crate trained. She is fine with other dogs and cats. And she's been in two home environments. She progressed steadily here. And she progressed steadily with foster. So wherever she goes they need to understand she needs time. And they need handling instructions. But Hope is so low maintenance. She's like a cat really. Feed her, water her, take her to the bathroom... And she's fine. The relationship part with a new person and new environment will take time.\"\n\nWe will require that an adopter have another dog, as Hope is very dependent on her confidence from another canine.  We will also require that an adopter have a fenced in yard.  No apartment or condo living would work for her.  She is NOT a dog that will take rides and enjoy dog parks or hikes or trips...she will not want to leave her safe environment and an adopter has to be satisfied with the progress made on her own \"turf\".\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHope is around 40lbs, she has been brought current on all vaccines, spayed, microchipped and made ready to begin her second chance at a life where she knows human love and caring.\n\nYou will simply be AMAZED when you follow her story on Facebook.  Updates, photos, videos and all posted to give you a full indication of what our Hope is all about.  She's a beautiful dog with incredible spirit....and is so very brave!\n\nCHECK HER OUT ON FACEBOOK:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/adoptmehope/",

She will need a patient, loving home!\n\nLong ago Hope stole our hearts and her story is told on her Facebook page at:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/adoptmehope/?modal=admin_todo_tour\n\nTake the time to follow that journey. Scroll down to the beginning.  There you will find the video of her when first taken to our trainer.   Hope was sent for their rehab/enrichment program.  Her total lack of socialization and her \"over the top\" fear in that initial video with our trainer will tear your heart apart!\n\nOnce Hope completed time with our trainer she went to a foster home.  This foster family had helped another dog that we rescued from the same hoarding surrender and was experienced in helping dogs like Hope progress.  \n\nIt has been a very slow process but we are SO VERY PROUD of Hope and are inspired by her.  I cannot even begin to imagine what it has taken for her to get as far as she has.  She is INCREDIBLY BRAVE but still has a long way to go.  ARE YOU THE PERSON WHO CAN HELP HER in continuing that journey to go beyond her fears?\n\nDo you have any other dogs?  Hope is very dependent on having another dog to help her.  She is NOT going to be a dog that you will be taking for walks and rides....she has come a long long way but has lots further to go and we feel that her family MUST have a canine companion.  She is great with other dogs and with cats to!\n\nIf you have ever known a feral dog, the lack of socializing done with dogs that are in hoarding situations is the best way to describe where Hope has come from.\n\nIf you are not experienced in handling dogs who have come from this situation or are feral and if you do not have another dog to help give her direction and confidence, Hope is not the dog for you and your family.\n\nShe is special needs in the sense that she will needs lots of patience and direction and continued encouragement.  But, the rewards of every little bit of progress will melt your heart......and, her devotion will be never-ending!",

She loves all humans and gets along with other dogs, she has a tendency to play rough which not all dogs respond well to. Likely not cat friendly and might be too lively for small children. She is dog door trained, potty trained, and sleeps well in her crate. She would do great with a active family and would make a great running partner",

            "description": "Follow us on Facebook for updated photos and more information on our adoptable pets!\nHi, I'm Mario! I'm between 1 and 2 years old with a lot of puppy energy and a teenager attitude. My favorite pass time activities include squirrel watching, chasing squirrels, going on walks to hunt squirrels and dreaming about squirrels. I'm told I'm very smart and learn new things quickly. While I seem perfect on the outside I've got a few issues I've been working on and could use some continued help with. I'm kind of awkward and goofy at times, but aren't we all? I love kids, especially the ones who like to play with me! I like to make friends with most other dogs, but I'm still learning what the appropriate way to meet them is. Cats.. why don't they want to play with me? I love a good routine, so if you think you are up for it I think we could be best friends!\n\nFrom the foster parents: \nMario is a very sweet boy and smart too! He's a lab mix, but don't let the photos fool you; he is smaller than he looks weighing in around 45-50lbs. He's surprisingly very soft to pet and tends to shed a lot, but he doesn't mind being brushed. Mario was found wondering the streets in the city and taken in as a stray. When his previous owners never claimed him, Lucky Paws jumped in and rescued him. He's crate trained, potty trained and knows basic commands like sit, shake, down and a few others. \n\nMario is a submissive dog with his humans and doesn't like getting yelled at when being naughty. He tends to act out when he doesn't get enough attention according to his standards, however he doesn't act out when you stick to a good routine. He likes to talk (bark) a lot more than some people enjoy; especially if there's a squirrel, dog or mail man around. He needs a home with a fenced in yard, because he will run off if not on a leash or in a fenced in area. He loves kids, but would do best in a home with older kids who will not let him run out the front door when you're not looking. He has some anxiety issues and is a bit high strung. We've been working on teaching him to trust and turn to his humans to tell him when things aren't dangerous. \n\nHe gets along with most dogs, but not all. He does better meeting other dogs when he's not being restrained by a short leash. Smaller dogs seem to bother him less than the bigger ones. He likes cats and wants to play with them even though they want nothing to do with him. \n\nHe's socially awkward at times and struggles with meeting and walking past other dogs. He really really dislikes older (senior) people. We have tried to figure this one out, but he is very nervous and uneasy around them. Mario is a fear reactive dog and tends to turn to \"fight or flight\" reactions. Some of his behaviors suggest that he was never properly taught how to socialize with other dogs and humans. We have worked very hard and have come a long way with teaching him to listen better, not to bark at other humans and dogs and to not pull while on the leash. His new family will need to continue training him with consistency. \n\nMario is up-to-date on all vaccines and is microchipped. His adoption fee is $400 plus WI state tax!\n\nPlease go to www.luckypawsmidwest.org fill out and application and once approved we will set up a meet and greet!\n",

            "description": "Luna is a Rescue from the San Bernardino area. As a part of our mission as a Rescue, we cover the spay/neuter of dogs for people in low income areas of San Bernardino. The previous owner of Luna called PetEmber and asked if we can help Spay her on the expense of the Rescue. Immediately PetEmber came to his house to take Luna and spay her at a partner clinic. Afterwards, Luna was kept in the Rescue for a week. After healed, the Rescue contacted the owner to take her back but he decided to relinquish her to the Rescue and asked the rescue to find a good home for her. Luna is a playful pitbull dog. She so sweet and cuddly. She gets along with all dogs (big and small). She acts perfect with people especially strangers. She is up to date on all vaccines and is in a great health. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting Luna out, please do not hesitate to fill out an online adoption application for her through the following link \n\nwww.petember.com/adoption-application \n\nWe will get in contact with you to schedule the meet and greet once your application is received and reviewed.",

She is as sweet as can be, loves laps, going for walks, and is pretty much perfect. She is potty trained, and if not able to go outside, they will use potty pads.\n\nShe weighs 19 pounds.

            "description": "\n\nDAMON\nDamon is an adorable young pup with an estimated date of birth of July 15th, 2019. Damon is happy and healthy but nervous of new things. Brother to Jason, both from a remote northern community.\nDamon is a timid pup and takes time to warm up to new situations & people, he is slowly learning that the world is not a scary place. He is good with dogs and cats although he does like to chase the cats. He is also house trained and crate trained. We would prefer Damon to go to a home with another female dog or no dog at all.\nFrom his foster:\n\"He knows sit, down, touch, leave it and come. He\u2019s good with our cat and listens to corrections from him. He is a giant puppy and likes to play rough and gets a little mouthy when he\u2019s really excited. He is house trained and kennel trained but is good at night sleeping without his kennel. He doesn\u2019t really like car rides and will drool everywhere! Damon loves to chase birds. He loves spending time outside and playing fetch, he is getting used to all the noises and isn\u2019t as scared of anything new anymore, he even goes up to the fence when there\u2019s people walking by or the neighbours are outside!\"\n\nDamon is now available for adoption. Please email our adoptions coordinator - adoptmasr@gmail.com",

Great with small dogs - unknown about larger dogs. She loves her tennis balls and squeaky toys and doesn't like to share!  She tears the stuffing out of everything including her bed.  Amazing strong, walks on a leash but she will take you where she wants to go so she needs some work. When she jumps up to be hugged she uses you for support so probably be rough on a small child but she loves kids.  Spayed and up to date on vaccines.  As you may have noticed, Hoppy only has 3 legs.  We don't know what happened to her but it doesn't slow her down or affect her happy smile!!  And SHE LOVES PANCAKES!  Serious inquiries only for this girl.

            "description": "THIS IS A COURTESY POSTING BY THE FOSTER MOM:\n\nDaisy is one of the smartest dogs I have ever met.  She learns quickly and at times seems to out think the people she is with.  She chases balls, does a few tricks, but really shines at figuring out puzzles and tasks on her own.  She can leap really high, and every year is fascinated by the barn swallows that nest in the eves around the house.  She doesn\u2019t want to hurt them, but she does like to watch.\n\nShe is very food motivated and will try to steal other dogs\u2019 meals if you don\u2019t watch her.  She also requires a sturdy fenced-in yard to keep her safe since she is part hound and could wander if left loose.  Daisy will also climb a chain link fence, so she needs a secure fence, such as a privacy fence or another type which is climb-proof.\n\nDaisy is about 6 years of age, spayed, fully vaccinated, and heart worm negative.  She weighs about 60 lbs and gets along well with other dogs.  She is cat aggressive, so her forever home must be without cats.  She is also likely to chase dogs smaller than herself.  She loves people and kids and will play all day if you let her.\n\nA home visit is a must.\n\nPlease contact Sue Sweeney at 770.583.3297 or at fairviewfarm@earthlink.net if you are interested in meeting Daisy.",

She is very active and playful and would do best in a home where she gets lots of exercise and interaction. She has come a long way since being in our care. She wasn\u2019t very well socialized at first but she is now doing great with the other dogs and loves to play. She definitely could use some good basic obedience training. She will need a firm handler that is familiar with the breed. She needs a fenced yard. She is very smart and learns quickly. She loves to go for walks.  She is housebroken and crate trained.  We recommend a home with no small children. Evie has been spayed and has had all her shots up. She unfortunately tested positive for heartworm but has been treated. She is now healthy and ready to find her forever home. For more information, please contact tamjov9@aol.com.",

When Chiquitin arrived at the shelter, he was pretty shut down. This is normal, and heartbreaking, for many owner-surrendered pups. They have no idea what they did wrong, why they are in this loud place, where their family is, and are they ever coming back for them. This is where the power of AAC's shy dog volunteers come in! They worked with Chiquitin daily, and little by little, he started to come out of his big fluffy shell. Now Chiquitin does the cutest dance when he sees his friends! He is the master of zoomies, and he loves to play with other pups. His roommates keep getting adopted and we're hoping that Chiquitin's turn is next! Large black dogs are the most overlooked dog in the shelter system. We think it's crazy, too!

Come visit her and take her for a walk, she\u2019s a good leash walker once she burns off a little energy. She would love an active owner and a fence in yard to explore. She does well with children, but gets overly excited around other animals. She would probably be most comfortable as an only dog in the home. \n\n\nAll animals are spayed/neutered and up to date on vaccinations before going home!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting me or want further information, please contact the shelter via email, or phone, or fill out an online application at ochumane.org\n\n\nAs part of the COVID-19 procedures, PetSmart and OCHS have had to cancel Saturday adoption events, until restrictions have been lifted. If you are interested in an animal, fill out an application. A shelter staff member will contact you, to set up an appointment to meet one of our animals at the shelter.",

Contact the rescue directly by email at furgetmenotrescue@gmail.com    PetFinder messages can not be answered.\n\n*Meetings are scheduled after a no obligation adoption application is completed online at furgetmenotrescue.org   To learn more about our adoption process please visit http://www.furgetmenotrescue.org/commonly-asked-questions.html\n\nMeet Dozer!  Dozer is a 3 year old male Olde English Bulldog.  The Olde English bulldog has a sweet, gentle disposition. Dependable and predictable, the bulldog is a wonderful family pet and loving to most children. People-oriented as a breed, they actively solicit human attention. We would love to find a family experienced with the English Bulldog breed for Dozer.  \n\nDozer is a lovable goofy boy.  We are requesting children older than 10 in the family due to his \"bull dozing\" capability.  He's just unaware of his size and could possibly knock small children down.  Dozer would love a fenced in yard of his own.  Dozer is very energetic but when exercised properly, enjoys lounging on the couch watching a good movie and snuggling.  He loves to be with his people and would benefit from being the only pet in the home so he can soak up all the attention himself.  Dozer is a happy go lucky kinda guy.  Everyone falls in love with him when they meet him. \n\nDozer's adoption fee is $300.00 which includes his neuter, current on all vaccines including Rabies, de-wormed, tested heart worm Negative and current on heart worm prevention and current on flea/tick prevention.    \n\n\nIf you meet the requirements-physically fenced yard, home owner, no young children, English/Olde English Bulldog experience and/or not a first time dog owner, and are able to deal with vetting and possible health issues and separation anxiety, then please submit an application at: http://www.furgetmenotrescue.org/adoption-application.html If you do not meet the requirements necessary to fulfill Dozer's needs and safety for all, do not inquire, as no exceptions will be made and you will not be answered. We are serious about what we do and advocate for responsible adoptions, proper research and preparedness, and a safe environment for all involved. We are making positive futures for our rescues and their adoptive families and will not put them in a situation in which they will not thrive. \n\nIf you're interested in adoption, but Dozer may not be a fit for your home, things happen quickly and change all the time in the rescue world. We can keep your application on file. We also network with several rescues and maybe we can work together to help you find the right fit for your home.\n\n\nYou can email his foster mom with questions at twelve.paws3@gmail.com \n\n",

Jonas has a long, soft, fluffy coat and is a smart boy who knows his basic cues, though he would love it if his furever family would dedicate time to add more skills into his toolbox so he can show off how exceptional he can be. Just like many of our pyr rescues, Jonas can be a tad wary when encountering strangers, but if you are patient and give him the time and space he needs, he will warm up to you in no time. Once he determines that you are trustworthy, he transforms into a loving companion where he may claim your lap as his own :) Jonas will thrive in a less active home without children and in a relatively quiet neighborhood, where his people have the time and patience to continue his training. This big boy has all the 'pawtential' to become your most loyal companion, will you open your heart to him?\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nView full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/rescue-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can call 877-739-3582 or email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed. \n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

            "description": "Say hello to Stumpy! This good girl was rescued and is ready for a forever home! Stumpy is one of the sweetest dogs that you will ever meet. Stumpy is nine years old and has lots more love to give. She is both house and potty trained, but hasn't gotten used to her crate yet. Stumpy is a very loving dog, but she gets scared when she is around men. Stumpy loves barbeques and will smile when she is content. She doesn't like being alone and prefers to hangout inside the house. Stumpy needs loving, but is very happy to give it back. She has an amazing personality that will make a great addition to your family. Stumpy is ready to be a part of your forever home. This pet is available for pre-adoption and may not be officially ready for adoption, as it is still undergoing medical treatment. Depending on the medical status, a Meet and Greet may be put on hold until they can safely participate in a meeting with potential adopters. In some cases, this pet may be able to move to its forever home while it is still under the medical care of Dallas Pets Alive. If you are interested in learning more, apply now and one of our Adoption Counselors will discuss the options available so you can bring home your new furry family member! Applications are processed in the order in which they are received; please be aware that this pet may have interested applicants ahead of you. All Dallas Pets Alive adoptable pets are spayed or neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines upon adoption. The standard minimum donation for dogs over six months to seven years is $200, puppies under six months is $250, dogs eight years and over are $100 unless specified otherwise. You can view all adoptable pets and fill out an adoption application online on our website at http://dallaspetsalive.org/adopt/adoptable-dogs/ .

Tonks is fully vetted, microchipped, up to date on shots, has been dewormed and is on flea and heartworm preventative. she also comes with a free vet visit and a free fecal at Oviedo Vet Care. if you're interested in Tonks, you can email me directly at ayurcisin27@yahoo.com.",

            "description": "MEET CHESHIRE!! **Please Note: This is a courtesy post for another rescue; different adoption fees/policy apply.\n\nCheshire is a 6 year old mix, who once comfortable, is the most loving, sweet, goofy, fun dog. He had no issues as a puppy, but when he was about 2 years old he decided that he wasn't a fan of other dogs and became a little fearful of people he didn't know. That's okay though because this boy has so much love to give that you'll want to give all your love to him and him alone!\n\nCheshire was diagnosed with hypothyroidism when he was 4, and it was explained that his changes in behavior likely resulted from this. The medication he needs is pretty inexpensive and an easy condition to treat.\n\nHe loves to hike, but is not a fan of the car. He loves to fetch, but it can be shortlived as he gets a little distracted. Haha He is a huge cuddlebug, and always wants to be as close to you as possible (he doesn't understand personal space). Cheshire is completely house-trained, and knows commands like sit, down, stay, wait, and come, although his recall could use some work because he gets distracted. He's crate-trained, although sometimes he does struggle with separation anxiety when he is not with his favorite person.\n\nMeeting new people is scary, and generally takes more than one visit before he's comfortable enough to let people love him as much as he really wants to love them, but given some time he does come around. Because he is scared of new people, he can come across unfriendly and will take another meeting to get used to you. But once he trusts you, however, he will trust you forever. He has never bitten anyone or anything like that-- he is just scared and needs a patient hand to guide him and make him feel safe. He's definitely a lover when you offer him patience and allow him to move at his own pace.\n\nCheshire is a handsome and sweet boy who just needs someone dedicated to making him feel secure. An experienced owner who knows how to lead would be a great fit and he would look up to you and bond nicely before long. Cheshire has a great heart and would be such an amazing companion with the right person. If that's you, please inquire because this one is a hidden gem!\n\nFor more information or to meet this pet, please complete an application or send email to info@underdogaz.com\n\nIf you're reading this via a pet-search site, please view this pet's page\n\nat www.UnderdogAZ.com/animals\n\nfor more photos and details.",

She loves to play with other playful dogs, but also knows how to leave the ones who don\u2019t want to play alone. The boarding facility who watched her said she was just amazing with all the dogs there and she lives with 6 other dogs and cats. She is full of energy so needs a family with a fenced yard where she can go and play. Although she does have energy she also knows how to cuddle and loves to nap on the couch with you. She knows some basic commands, but would do well with a family who will continue training with her. She went to a specialist to look at her legs, but we decided since she is not in pain and gets around perfectly fine she will be fine just how she is. She is located in Huntsville AL, fully vetted, hw negative, spayed and microchipped. If you would be interested in adding her to your family please fill out an application at forrescue.net",

Lyra's special request:  a big window to look out at the world and watch for my family to return \n\nAdditional info:\n\nLyra is now fully housetrained and will even let her foster know when she has to go out. However, she does prefer to use the privacy of the yard and won't go on walks. But she is also now leash trained and is very happy when it's time to go out for her strolls, she will still need a calm area as she is still a little shy of too much commotion and new people. But Lyra has come such a long way and I'm sure she will continue to improve.\n\n\nIf you are not ready to adopt just yet and would like to help in other ways, please consider clicking on the green \u201cSponsor Me\u201d button above to help this dog receive the best care we can give.

            "description": "Puppet is a sweet goofy boy who loves people! He's really comfortable with every person he meets and just wants to hang out with you and be a silly goober. Puppet is a medium energy dog who likes to play and has bursts of energy, but he's also comfortable just chilling with you. Puppet has lived with a young child before. His fosters say he is really tolerant of being touched/handled and has a really happy and friendly disposition, though when he gets really excited he can jump around a little (and is a big boy). Puppet needs to be the only animal in the house, and would prefer living in a neighborhood on the quieter side. Some awesome things about Puppet: - He's fully potty trained and is working on being crate trained. - A big cuddle bug (he's just a really fun dog to cuddle. He particularly likes napping with his people and butt scratches). - Knows several commands and is VERY food motivated during training. - Super comfortable being handled (having his feet/legs touched, getting bathed, etc.) He let his fosters give eye drops and clean his eyes following a surgery with no issues whatsoever, even on the first day he met them. - Likes napping with you and being close to you, but also will go off on his own for parts of the day. - Loves car rides and is generally pretty well behaved in the car. - Hasn't reacted to the door bell or the vacuum in his foster home. - Very nice and well-behaved with veterinary staff. - Polite at human meal times (doesn't beg excessively even though he really loves food). Puppet is just an all-around nice boy. He has a really fun and happy personality, is energetic, and has a lot of love to give to his future forever home.",

Yes, he really is as adorable as pictured!\n\nWhat the photos don't show is the tough time he's had in his young life. Korey was found in the streets of China, beaten and left to perish. A local rescue nursed him back to relative health and contacted RAGOM. With the collaborative efforts of a village of volunteers, donors, and medical personnel, Korey arrived in Minnesota in January of 2020.\n\nHis abusive past notwithstanding, Korey is the most astonishingly bright-hearted pup ever! He's so happy, exuberant, and oh-so loving that everyone who meets him marvels at his resilience and can't help but shower him with affection.\n\nThe only remnant of the trauma he's suffered is his paralysis, which has barely slowed him down. He moves around the house easily by using his front legs and has a wheelchair for outdoor adventures. \n\nSweet Korey is looking for a very special family who can manage his incontinence. Prior experience isn't required - we'll teach you. Fortunately, he is obedient so diaper-changing and cleaning will be easy once you learn the techniques.\n\nIf you have what it takes to provide for Korey's needs, he'll reward you with his perennial cuteness and undying devotion, and you get the bragging rights of being the forever family of an amazing survivor!  We ask that you read through Korey's page carefully and evaluate whether your home environment and lifestyle match his requirements before submitting an Inquiry for Application form on our website.\n\nTo learn more about Korey, see his bio at: https://ragom.org/dogs/korey-19-257c\n\nPlacement Requirements:\nGood With Dogs: Yes\nGood With Cats: Not Tested\nGood With Kids: 8+\nFence: Physical fence optional\nAge: Approx. 1 year\n\nIf you are interested in any of the dogs available at Retrieve a Golden of the Midwest (RAGOM), you can read our adoption process and apply to adopt, which can be found at https://ragom.org/our-adoption-process. RAGOM\u2019s adoption territory includes: Minnesota; Iowa; North Dakota; South Dakota; Western Wisconsin (within 75 miles of the Minnesota border)\n",

While he is very very shy and timid at first, he can be very playful and cuddly. Simon loves chewing on his toys and playing with his humans. For the most part, he's very relaxed and can fall asleep just about anywhere (he is also quite the snorer). It's not clear how he is with other dogs just yet, but he definitely would rather chase cats than befriend them.

(3/8) Return after 2 months - aggression to people.Dog Meets:Big Ben and Peanut: https://youtu.be/ka9LRcHy7F0Big Ben and Lexx: https://youtu.be/UwbyYI0Cx2sVideos:Big Ben is a gentle boy: https://youtu.be/FcWPITn7pEUBig Ben taking treats so gently: https://youtu.be/CHbPXh5y8IYBig Ben getting some R&R: https://youtu.be/hmJngaWGqvABig Ben meeting a new friend: https://youtu.be/PHSTzg7fPC8Day Trip Photos: https://photos.app.goo.gl/RYrY43eukdezXtrp7Photos: https://flic.kr/s/aHsmMpmsatWeight: 70.40 lbsMedical Observation: Neutered and Microchipped.(4/7) Vet Check -- Dog was in a fight two days ago. Sustained puncture wound above left eye that was crusted over with mild discharge when removed scab, no other puncture wounds found but did have some dried blood crusted to fur around eye. Both eyes have scleral hemorrhage but left more than right and left eye also had some mucoid yellow-green ocular discharge and mild conjunctivitis. Not blepharospastic, no overt swelling.(3/24) Vet Check -- Ambulatory x4, but grade 1/4 lemaness left forelimb. No pain or discomfort elicited with orthopedic exam, good ROM all joints. Walks with left elbow slightly abducted from body. Still active, walking and trotting, pulling at leash. Would benefit from full orthopedic work-up and may need chronic NSAID therapy which is beyond shelter's capacity for treatment.(3/19) Vet Check - Senior dog with possible arthritis(3/16) PE: Slightly Cloudy Slightly Dirty Ears Tartar on Teeth Pressure on Legs(3/15) NRO(12/8) Vet Check - Patient had to be muzzled by kennel attendant and low growling throughout time on exam room when started assessment even if not performing anything hands on. Scrotum is very mildly enlarged but soft, incision site healing well with no active discharge. Mild scrotal hematoma that already appears to be resolving on own. Digit 2 left front foot filed down and quick opened up while walking and actively bleeding(12/6) Dog presented in kennel with diarrhea. Tx: drontal and a monitor sheet(12/1) Initial Exam- dirty coat, long nails, dirty ears waxy earsBehavior Observation: (4/15) Easily leashed, walks with mild pulling, in the yard he sniffed the perimeter with a loose body. He approached the handler and solicits interaction with a soft body and open mouth. He is not interested in toys. Takes treats with a soft mouth, knows sit and stay.(3/8) Per adoptive owner - protective, quiet, fights with other dogs, walks well on leash, aggressive - bites, snaps at animals, no interactions with young kids, used to be fine around the 16-year-old kid who worked with the owner. Then the other day he bit the kid on the arm. Only shown aggression to people one time. However he does not like it if people lean over top of him - he feels threatened. He is mostly dog aggressive but bit with no warning recently. Very smart dog, trains easily.(12/8) Vet Staff - Patient had to be muzzled by kennel attendant and low growling throughout time on exam room when started assessment even if not performing anything hands on.(11/30) Per finder- \"so so\", calm as far as finder could tell, barked at other dogs while on a walk, pulled when walking but gets tired* * * * *Bite Details* * * * *Have you noticed any unusual behavior prior to bite: no, dog was playing with the victimWhat were the events leading up to this bite incident: 16 year old was playing with the dog at the owner's shop. They were done playing, and 16 year old walked away. Big Ben came up to him as he wanted to keep playing. He leaned over top of Big Ben, and the dog suddenly bit onto his left arm, clamped down and did not let go. Did you think the animal might bite before the incident happened: no, he's never bit someone before and was really good with him before, so they didn't think he would biteDescribe another time this animal bitten or scratched: he previously bit another dog, as he is very dog aggressive, but he has never bitten a person other than this recent incident. Two past times, he reacted aggressively when people leaned over the dog's head - he seems very threatened by this. Neither of those incidents resulted in an actual bite.",

She may not make a great Livestock Guardian Dog but she definitely has the tendencies. Tori enjoys watching over her home and property.\n\nShe has come a long way since she was found dumped on a country road, skinny and neglected. She's a little timid, but she has been coming out of her shell in her foster home and she loves her people. She's been showing us how funny and affectionate she can be.\n\nTori has a malformation in one of her front legs; we've had it checked by several vets and so far, they have recommended against amputation. Tori gets around great--she loves to chase squirrels and do zoomies! This sweet girl will make a wonderful, loyal, loving pet.\n\nPlease fill out our Adoption application: https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/24333/generic\n\nSomeone will reach out to you ASAP to get the approval process started.\n\n",

Sorry for the inconvenience.\n\nhttps://forms.gle/MqyNtmLTzPmLwear6\n\nOliver is four years old. He needs to work on his social skills with other dogs and he isn't good with cats or strangers. Once he likes you, you're in. He's not fond of goats or farm animals either. He loves to walk, he's strong but learning how to walk on leash. He'd make a good \"partner\" dog for a single guy.

He's medium sized and full of energy, very food motivated, loves to play fetch, chew on his bones and RUN! We stress the play and run because he\u2019s a little busy boy, great companion on leash, loves to explore. If you\u2019re looking for an adventurous and active dog, this is your man! \nGood with other dogs, but extremely playful so he would do best in a home with another active or very tolerant pup.  \nBrennan also does know how to relax though. He\u2019s a great cuddle buddy and makes the funniest little groans when he's being loved on.\nHe's neutered, house trained, and up to date on all of his vaccines and prevention. He is heartworm positive, but has received treatment.\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our dogs are healthy, spayed/neutered, vaccinated and on heartworm preventative. They live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. Many have basic obedience skills and all have been temperament tested. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, please visit our website to complete an application: http://www.takepawsrescue.org/adoption-form\n(please note: app cannot be done on a mobile device)\n\nIf you have any questions, please email us at adopt@takepawsrescue.org",

AVAILABLE for Adoption* at ACCT Philly !!!*with behavior waiverDIAMOND - A#43272812Foster's Email: benjamin.letter@gmail.comDiamond's Instagram: @diamondtherunPhotos and video:Diamond in foster care - https://flickr.com/photos/187791540@N06/https://youtu.be/opa4x6ot6dEhttps://youtu.be/CKKNXkRwq_QHi I'm Diamond! I may be a middle aged girl but I've got the energy of a pup to go along with my wisdom. I love the outdoors and belly rubs and love having human friends around to hang out with.I pull at my harness when we walk but it's only because I love being out in this beautiful world of ours! A little tug on the leash will remind me to slow down and walk with you.I looove to run! I'm very fast but I know you're slower than me so I'll run at whatever pace you choose. I even run in my sleep. Did I mention I hold the record for fastest mile ever? ...at ACCT Philly that is.I get very excited when I see other dogs. Pets and reassurance that we're safe keep me calm until the other dog passes.I love humans of all shapes and sizes. Big or small we get along great. I always want to be in the room with you, unless maybe there's something exciting outside the window.I like to cuddle and I love a good belly rub. Don't worry, I make it easy for you to reach and am happy to lean into you to make you feel loved too. I also use pillows like humans do so you're going to have to share.I'm very patient and very gentle. I'll wear silly things for photos, I take treats nicely, if my nails are too long I'll let you cut them, and I'll even let you pick me up and carry me around if that's really what you want to do.I'm not at all food aggressive. I once found a tasty chicken bone on the Philly streets but my foster dad caught me in the act. He told me no so I let him open my mouth to take it out. I think I earned an extra treat later for being so nice about it. I think he wanted it for himself.I'm learning lots of new tricks at my foster home. I'm a pro at sit, come, and paw. I know wait for walks when we need to stop at a corner and look to get my attention. I know what stay means but it's just so hard to stay when there are treats to be had! I'm working on it. Can't give it all up at once.Intake Type: 3/4 - Return adoption; 1/17- Return adoption after 3 weeks - Aggression to animals; 12/17- Return adoption after 3 days - Aggression to animals; Owner Surrender 11/20 - HomelessnessWeight: 65.20 lbs++Bite Details++ The adopter and Diamond were on a run. Diamond saw another dog and the adopter held Diamond between her legs. She states she's taken Diamond out on runs before, and Diamond hasn't reacted like this. When the other dog owner was trying to pass Diamond disregarded the fact that adopter was trying to hold her back and dragged adopter which lead to her scraping her back. Diamond jumped on the other dog and an officer ran up on the scene and maced Diamond in the face to get the dogs off of each other. While the dogs were tangled together and both owners were trying to separate the dogs, the other owner got bit by his own dog and Diamond's adopter got bit on the right thumb by Diamond. Diamond did not continue the attack on the adopter; it was a quick redirection bite.This animal is currently available through ACCT Philly's Adoptions Programs. We encourage you to visit our shelter during our adoption hours to view our complete selection of available animals. In preparation for you visit, please make sure to visit http://www.acctphilly.org/adopt/ to review our adoption requirements, hours of operation, upcoming events, and more! Is this your missing pet? If you believe so, please make sure to follow the instructions listed at http://www.acctphilly.org/lostpet/ so that we can make sure that you are reunited as soon as possible!",

I like to have fun, and you know I'm happy because my tail never stops wagging!\n\nI have lots of toys to play with. My foster mom picks up all the toys and puts them in a bucket. Now it's time to take all the toys from the bucket and spread them all around! Yay, this is such a blast! My brother (Jimmy) and I like to do this together. It's awesome to have my brother with me... we really enjoy each other's company. As a matter of fact, we not only play together, but also sleep together and get belly rubs together. It's double the fun!\n\nI bet you didn't know that I'm already both house trained and crate trained. I also know the commands \"sit,\" down,\" and \"come.\" My humans are very pleased with my knowledge. They also enjoy the fact that I walk very nicely on my leash. However, I prefer to walk around in the yard instead of on the street. I get really scared when cars go by. If I see one of those frightening cars, I just roll over and refuse to get up. I get pretty jumpy when the wind blows things around, too. I'm learning to accept the windy weather and overcome any fear pretty quickly. However, I will need a lot more support to get over my fear of cars.\n\nSpeaking of cars, I am not a huge fan of riding in them either. I just get so anxious. Oh, no. Now I am so embarrassed... I left a little piddle behind. So sorry... I just got nervous.\n\nWhen nighttime comes, Jimmy and I snuggle in bed with our foster family. It's so nice to cuddle and feel safe. Do a pair of lovable beagles sound like the perfect addition to your family? Please consider adopting me along with Jimmy and we promise you will never have a shortage of beagle love.\n\n\n\n------\n\nB.O.N.E.S. is a foster-home-based rescue organization serving dogs and potential adopters in the New England states. We do not have a shelter. Please visit our home page at www.bonesbeagles.org for information about our adoption process.",

Do you like to play with toys? I have lots of toys to play with. My foster mom picks up all the toys and puts them in a bucket. Now it's time to take all the toys from the bucket and spread them all around! Yay, this is such a blast!\n\nMy brother (Chief) and I like to do this together. It's awesome to have my brother with me...we really enjoy each other's company. As a matter of fact, we not only play together, but also sleep together and get belly rubs together. It's double the fun!\n\nI overheard my foster mom say that I am very puppy-like. Okay, so maybe I am not a little pup anymore, but I am certainly very young at heart. I am making very good progress on my house training, and I am already crate trained. Sometimes I do things that my foster mom doesn't want me to do, so she tells me \"no.\" Hmmm, not sure what that means. Oh, well.\n\nI do have a tendency to be a little nosy. If my foster siblings are playing, I will go over to see what they are up to. Even things that scare me at first eventually pique my curiosity. I jump when I hear a loud noise, but shortly thereafter I'm investigating the sound. I am a beagle who needs to know things.\n\nI like to go for walks, and I walk very nicely on my leash. Of course, running around with Chief is also great fun!\n\nWhen nighttime comes, Chief and I snuggle in bed with our foster family. It is so nice to cuddle and feel safe. Do a pair of lovable beagles sound like the perfect addition to your family? Please consider adopting me along with Chief, and we promise you will never have a shortage of beagle love.\n\n\n\n------\n\nB.O.N.E.S. is a foster-home-based rescue organization serving dogs and potential adopters in the New England states. We do not have a shelter. Please visit our home page at www.bonesbeagles.org for information about our adoption process.",

            "description": "Jewel was around 7 years old as of January, 2021 and has been waiting for a long time for some one to come and meet her but no one ever comes to meet her. WHY?. She has a loving temperament with people and has been around children with no issues. She has the typical loving of an Aussie mix and is very quiet. It doesn't take to long for her to warm up to people. She is not great with some dogs and we recommend a home with no other pets. She is more about exploring and getting a snack or some love.

Due to his over zealous happy guy behavior small kids are also not in the ideal picture of a family for him. Kids that are 12+ would be ok, considering they may be knocked down on a regular basis.\nGeppetto is crate trained and would need to be crated when no one is home. His curiosity when left alone sometimes gets the best of him.\nIf you are interested in meeting this handsome, loving. ball of energy go to www,regaldanerescue.com and submit an application.\nGeppetto is located in Arizona and is adoptable in Arizona only.",

I am potty trained and crate trained. My favorite hobbies include cuddling and pleasing my foster mom. I am fully vaccinated, microchipped, and spayed. Once I find my forever home, I can't wait to spend as much time as possible with them! I am currently in a foster home learning how to be a great indoor pet! With my foster parents, I live with a cat and a dog; however, I require a meet and greet with any other dogs in your household.",

You see, my spine was fractured leaving me paralyzed from the waist down. \n\nThankfully, this rescue gave me a second chance. I am happy to be alive and am perfectly capable of living a good quality life. I just need to find a family who is perfectly cable of caring for my special needs :)\n\nI am guessed to be a 5-year-old Treeing Walker Coonhound. I love the company of other dogs and walking in my cart! I also enjoy getting pet by everyone I meet. If you don\u2019t come to me, I\u2019m rolling my way to you. \n\nMy bladder needs expressed every 6 hours, and I cannot control my bowels. If you cannot deal with diapers, pee, and poopy messes, I will not be a good fit for you.\n\nI had bilateral leg amputation surgery to remove my back legs since they were dead weight. More recent pics are me without legs :)\n",

Not sure they spent much time at all as they were pretty scared when we took them in.  They were so fearful,. Bandit was adopted after being in the rescue a few months, but Cash is still with us a year later. He is just so shy but given a chance would be a great boy. Cash is a reddish brown and very fluffy.  His mom is a Shepherd/Heeler mix and his dad was a Lab.  Please consider giving him a home.  \n\nCash's adoption fee is $350, but he has a $100 sponsor to help his new family. .  This covers his neuter, microchip, vaccines, heartworm test and deworming.  He will also be kept on flea and heartworm prevention until adopted.\n\nTo apply for Cash go to www.lifehouse.petfinder.com and click on the link to apply online.

We'll never know what happened to Ellie in the past, but it couldn't have been a happy life that she lived.  That's all behind her now and Ellie doesn't hold anything against anyone.  Ellie needs a pet-free home, but she sure loves people.  She is an absolute angel.  A strong and active angel, yes, but so well-behaved and sweet.  Ellie sits and lays down when she's asked and she's very gentle with taking treats and toys.  Ellie would just love a home where she can plop on the couch with you at night and lay her head in your lap, and be loved by a good family forever.  File#29441  1/17/20\nCall 609-693-1900 or email:  office@ahsppz.org for an appointment to meet Ellie.\n<p>\nIf interested please visit our Forked River Shelter. We are open Mon. - Fri. from \n12:00 P. M. - 6:00 P. M.; and Sat. & Sun. 12:00 P. M. - 5:00 P. M. for directions call 609-693-1900. There is an adoption donation required.

            "description": "Click my picture for more info. on me!\nBailee is a super cute ball of fun! Bailee is a compact little pitbull mix who is about one and a half years old. She is full grown at about 35 pounds. She loves to snuggle and play.\n\nBailee loves to play with other dogs and really needs a home with another young dog who can play with her all day! She really benefits from structure and she needs to taught that by another dog in the home too. Currently she shares a foster home with three other dogs and she would love a forever home like that too. However, she can be a bit of a bully to older dogs who don't stand up to her. She's young and sometimes doesn't realize that she is not in charge.\n\nShe also is in a foster home with cats and loves to play with the household kitten. The older cats are not as thrilled about her energy level though, so we think that a family with dog savvy cats would be best. We also think that she would do well with older kids. She is a little too rambunctious for toddlers. Bailee is about 95% housebroken- sometimes she gets excited and slips up. She has amazing recall and learns new things quickly! We do not think that she needs a fenced in yard, but she does need a hone who will keep her active. She competed in a lure coursing event and won her class- she is a fast little girl and loves to run and play fast!\n\nEstimated DOB: 12/16/2018\n\nAdoption fee: $250\n\nCLICK HERE to APPLY TO ADOPT\nor paste the following link in your browser: https://fayettehumane.org/adopt/dogapplication/\nFor full details about ADOPTING, please visit our Adoption Guide (https://fayettehumane.org/adoption-information/adoption-guide/).\n\nAll our dogs are tested for heartworms, spayed/neutered, up-to-date on age appropriate vaccines and flea prevention.\n\nCats are tested for FLV/FIV when age appropriate, as kittens tested at an age less than 16 weeks tends to lead to unreliable results.

This sweet boy was just returned after only a few days and is heartbroken to be back in a shelter environment. Angus suffers with some separation anxiety, but is improving greatly with his meds and our fabulous trainer which will continue to support his new foster or adopter! Angus would do best as the only pet in the home, he just adores his people so much he prefers not to share. This handsome boy has waited long enough to find his special someone! He has so much love to give and deserves to be doted on, snuggled and played with. \n\n\nTo apply to foster or adopt this medium sized boy, visit CaneRossoRescue.org. Any donations towards his medical care are also truly appreciated.\n\nThanks for considering a Cane Rosso Rescue dog! \nWe place dogs mostly in Texas but have adopted out a few out-of-state as well.\n \nIf you are interested in one of our dogs, please first complete our adoption application.\nYou can find it at http://www.canerossorescue.com/application/ .

            "description": "Princess is an interesting looking four to six year-old shepherd mix. She has quite an underbite which gives her a very unique smile. She was transferred to us from another shelter where she was scheduled to be euthanized for space. She is currently heartworm positive. She might be an older gal, but she definitely feels large and in charge. She likes to be the boss in canine relationships. She has been kenneled successfully with other dogs, but it has to be the right fit; she's not a fan of anyone who likes to talk back to her or tell her what to do. She was easy to handle during physical exam although when she first arrived she was a bit on the nervous side. She has settled in nicely. She walks pretty well on a leash and is attentive. She was well mannered during physical exam. We think that with her age and slight behavioral quirks, she would probably do best in a home with children 10 years of age and older and with an owner who is willing to help her adjust to her new life. We think a quiet home would suit her best. She is able to climb fences, so her new family would need to be prepared to handle that situation. Dogs are generally tested with dogs of their own size; and dog meets with the resident dogs are always encouraged. Our cat test should be used as a general purpose screening only to rule out overt aggression; we always recommend caution when introducing dogs to cats in the home. Recommendation on suitability of placement with children by their ages is based on behavioral observations including energy level and response to body handling. We never recommend leaving young children unsupervised with dogs, and we cannot guarantee the behavior of dogs with children, other pets or cats. Behavior evaluations should be considered as a snapshot of the behavior of the dog at this point in time; SCPR believes all dog families need to be prepared to invest time and energy into training as well as provide common sense management of their new dog. We always encourage family to do some research on the breeds or mixes of breeds prior to adoption as many can have some unique characteristics that may or may not fit into their families. For more information about this dog or any others at our Shelter, please visit www.doitforthedogs.com. We are the Second Chance Pet Rescue in Grove, OK. 918-786-7630.

He is located in Williamsburg, Va.\n\nMelo is a 4-year-old, neutered male, hound dog. Good health, and on heartworm prevention. Not up to date on all vaccines. He has a dominant temperament, but has lived with other dogs. Melo greatly enjoys his foster family\u2019s golden retriever, and they play together. He is very food/treat motivated and learns commands quickly. He is house trained. He also loves to play fetch and run outside. Melo shows resource guarding, anxiety, and fear aggression, all of which need continual training. Strong prey drive, so he doesn\u2019t do well with cats or other pets. Young children are unknown. Needs good forever family to give him love, training, and exercise! Experience with high energy dogs is a must.\n\nCall or Text for More Information\n(703) 405-3381",

Given Remi's experiences in life so far, as well as his personality, he will need to continue with his training in his forever home.  Remi suffers from barrier frustration and leash reactivity, both highly trainable issues.\n\nThe ideal home for Remi would be consistent, relatively quiet but also active, LOVING, and patient.  He is a special dog that deserves another chance on life other than the one he has had so far.\n\nCurrently, Remi is in a foster home where things are going quite well.  He is working on his \"inside\" manners and loving having his very own yard to zoom around in.\n\nCOVID-19: At this time, our county is currently in Phase 2 of the government's reopening plan.

            "description": "Crystal Symphony is a beautiful female estimated between 2 and 3 years of age. She was found as a stray and has an unknown background. Her conformation and personality speak to a possible English Shepherd pedigree but that is a question we will never really know the answer to.\n\nCrystal is a lovely girl who enjoys herding people and dogs in the yard, romping in the house, and getting attention when it pleases her. She can be reserved with new people and seems to be more weary in new situations. She may take a few minutes - plus a walk with treats - to warm up but once she does she is a very affectionate and sweet girl. Crystal is best described as 'gamey' which is to say she sees nearly everything as a fun game and is always looking for something to get into. Given socialization and confidence she would make an amazing advanced obedience or dog sport prospect. Crystal can easily jump a 4 ft fence and happily does so to switch play groups at her foster home. She is an athletic and energetic girl who will need either leash walked or a solid fence to ensure her safety. Crystal has not been around children at this time.\n\nCrystal is around other dogs in her foster home and does very well. She has a bossy personality and likes to try to round up the other dogs but they tolerate her well. She has a few that she enjoys roughhousing with and overall seems to have a good understanding of dog social manners. Crystal is well mannered and quiet when meeting new dogs while out on walks. Crystal has met some GSD puppies around 10 lbs and thought they were strange little playmates but ultimately did great with them. She has had one cat brief interaction with a cat that went well but would need further cat testing before going into a new home with cats.\n\nCrystal is an active and adventurous young Shepherd who is looking for a family that will help her learn to trust the world and show her all the fun sides of life. If you're the home for Crystal Symphony please email Tierhavenrescue@gmail.com for an adoption application or visit our website, Tierhaven.rescuegroups.org to view our adoption process and fee.",

He is tall and lean and has one of those cute nubby tails that does a little wiggly show ;-) His lean-nes is maybe Greyhound? He loves having his back scratched :-)  He completed basic training and knows his basic commands. He lives for hikes and walks as well as snuggles and couch time! \n\nHe is neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, crate-trained and house-trained. He is 4yrs old. \n\nOur process is to contact us via email DesertPawsNM@gmail.com (please do not call). We have an online application, we have a meeting at your home with your family members including current pets. (Yes we bring the pet to you!) a trial adoption and stay in touch - we love updates! \n.\nWe adopt locally to the Santa Fe, central ABQ, Rio Rancho and Los Alamos areas of New Mexico.",

Dogs available for adoption can be met by appointment only. Potential adopters should submit an online application at http://muttloverescue.org/application.html. Once we receive your application, we will contact you to let you know the next steps.\n\nWe are always desperate for foster homes, now more than ever.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Lilly is quite the special lady at Safe Haven - starting with her arrival in November as she flew in from a pound in Indiana on the volunteer 'Pilots-n-Paws' flight program! She won over the hearts of all that cared for her in Indiana, as well as all of us at Safe Haven! Because Lilly had a serious infection in her uterus (Pyometra) and the malnourished state she was in - her condition was critical! We were happy we had room and wonderful volunteers devoted to take Lilly in and slowly turn this sweet pup's life around! Lilly doesn't seem to appreciate any of the dogs in the shelter, and we feel she may likely do best in a home with no other pets. She is a 100% lover and cuddlebug - never met a couch she didn't like to cuddle on! :) She also does a fantastic job at keeping her kennel clean, so she appears to be housebroken. We also have decided Lilly must have a little 'Hound' mix in her because she loves to howl in her kennel, and sniffing around on her walk is also a favorite past time. It has been fun watching her blossom into the great dog she is, and guess what type of mix she is! When Lilly first arrived she had multiple health concerns, including being severely underweight. She hardly had any hair on her body, and her skin was very red and inflammed in several areas. We are happy to report that she has steadily gained weight (almost 20 pounds) and is looking much better. Lilly's bloodwork also revealed that she has a thyroid condition (hypothyroidism) which was definitely contributing to her poor overall health and lack of hair. After starting multiple medications (for thyroid, fungal infection, medicated shampoo, and possible skin allergies) she definitely looks so much better, and she will likely need to continue on at least the thyroid medication for her entire life. Lilly does not do well with cats at all, and is very selective about her dog friends - so she will be happiest as an only pet, and with a family that understands she would not do well at dog parks, trails, or other places where other dogs may be visiting too. After a couple months of steady improvements when Lilly first arrived to Safe Haven, she still seemed to have a few lingering issues with her coat and skin. At times the skin on her feet, belly and face turn red, and she has even broke out in hives a few times - so on 3/11/2020 Lilly went to an appointment with a specialty vet (Dermatologist) at Eastern Iowa Vet Specialty Center in Cedar Rapids. The vet is making some adjustments with Lilly's medication to try and help determine if she may have any environmental or food allergies. Depending on Lilly's response, we may need to do actual allergy testing. We hope to have some answers in a month. We are determined to help Lilly feel and look even better. We feel Lilly is stable enough for us to start looking for Lilly's FOREVER HOME and hope that her family will love her as deeply as we do!*Update June 2020 - Lilly is doing great on her current medication. She does have one prescription medication for her thyroid condition which requires her to take daily thyroid medication. This condition is likely to be a lifelong condition for Lilly, so her forever family will need to be willing to monitor this condition and ensure she has her thyroid levels tested annually and receives her medication. If needed, Safe Haven may be able to financially help with these expenses - as our goal is to help Lilly find a family to love her uncoditionally! She does still have occasional and temporary flare ups of red skin on her feet and sometimes belly and face - but that has gotten much better over the past couple months. Lilly receives regularly scheduled medicated baths that seems to help, and she also eats a sensitive skin food. *Update 11/1/20 - Lilly just never seemed to completely overcome her flare-ups of red, itchy skin - so the Dermatologist Vet started an allergy food trial this summer to see if this would improve her skin/coat condition - but after a couple months with no improvements, Lilly did have environmental allergy testing done in October which revealed she does have many different allergies to the world around her......including to different grasses, wildflowers, dust and dust mites, spiders, and corn - just to name a few. While these results with so many allergies were disappointing, they did not really come as any suprise and at least we now know exactly what is causing Lilly the most issues. She is now taking daily immunotherapy medication, which is a serum made up of small doses of the things she is allergic to, so that should help her build up a tolerance to these allergies over time. This immunotherapy process does take up to 12 months to really see it helping Lilly - but we are committed to seeing her through this process, and Safe Haven will continue to pay for this treatment over the next 12 to 18 months, because if the right family comes along we certainly don't want this treatment to deter her adoption! :) Interested in adopting this pet?

As you can tell from his pictures, Tempo has some deformities on the top of his head which results in a \"scrunched up\" look.  He also has some small behaviors that lead us to believe that he has some degree of Vestibular Disease (a genetic neurological issue) although he functions quite normally.  Tempo is energetic and would do great in an active household that also has the time to put in some training.  He is very loving with people and welcoming of affection.  When it comes to other dogs, his behavior can be hit-or-miss.  He can be playful with some but he doesn't like others so he should have careful socialization time with a Dobie-savvy caretaker.",

            "description": "Maddie is a beautiful three-year-old, 52 lb. pitbull /terrier mix ready to finally find her happily furever after home ! Help her put a smile back on her face...she has a gentle soul and sadly had a difficult start to her life as she was used as a backyard breeding dog. She arrived to the shelter in pretty rough shape. Her eyes tell a story of neglect and she desperately wants to find love and a safe place to call home. Her ears are chewed up and we believe it's from the male dogs trying to dominate her. \n\nMaddie is a timid and shy pup but will warm up for attention and love, never having had that before. She loves to cuddle on the couch with you and watches tv too. She is afraid of every noise and sound  outside and will take extra time to decompress. As you pet her, her tail slowly begins to wag and she begins to trust you. She is the sweetest girl and wants to know you won't abandon her after spending five months in the shelter.\n\nMaddie is very affectionate and has beautiful eyes. She just needs someone who will take it slow and help her feel safe. She will make a wonderful addition to a quiet and relaxed adult-only home. She is dog friendly and has made friends with a little shepherd pup. She needs another dog in the home to help build her confidence. Maddie loves to roam the yard and lay in the sun. She does fine on a a leash and likes her walks. A fenced yard is a must. Adopters that are NOT gone long hours are highly preferred.\n\nMaddie  is currently being fostered in North Carolina as she finishes her heartworm treatment. Maddie will arrive up to date on vaccines, microchipped, and spayed. If you are interested in adopting this sweet and sensitive girl, please email   Laura@RoadHomeRescue.com\n\n**No apartments or college students. We also do a trial foster-to-adopt period as we want everyone to be happy.",

DO NOT USE the e-mail attached to this account.\n\nPUDDIN is an adult male American Bulldog mix.  He is black with white markings.   His weight is not noted, but he is clearly a mid to large size dog. Staff really likes him! His pictures make him look serious and severe. He is anything but that once he is allowed out of his kennel. Unfortunately, that has not been able to happen very often during the time that he has been at the shelter. He acts like a child in a candy store and he wants to run and play and he has the biggest smile on his face that you could ever imagine.  When staff takes him out of his kennel and puts him on a leash, he is pretty much adorable! He has not yet been neutered by whoever previously owned him.  So, that still needs to be done.  Please read the important information below for more details.  He is doing really well with the staff, but does need a firm responsible adult who actually knows how to manage this dog. Staff can fill you in on the details concerning what they are looking for in a potential adopter. \n\nAdoption fees are $80 for dogs.  Cat adoption fees are $50. Cash or check only. Please be sure to take the exact amount with you.\n\nThe shelter routinely vaccinates all healthy appearing animals upon their arrival at the shelter and deworms them.  Any animals not already spayed/neutered must have the procedure done through the veterinary clinic that contracts with the county before that animal can be released from the clinic to the new family. By state law, animals old enough to be given a rabies vaccine, must have that vaccine done, as well.  The vaccine is given by the veterinary clinic staff at a separate cost to the adoptive family. \n\nHold periods for every incoming animal vary for several reasons including, but not limited to, whether the animal came in from the Cumberland County area, or from the City of Crossville, which contracts with the county for its animal shelter services.  Check with the staff to verify the availability date of every animal for which you have an interest.\n\nFor more information on this pet, call the shelter at (931)484-8525. The shelter is open Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday from 10am to 2pm. Closed Wednesday and Sunday and county observed holidays.",

This handsome man was rescued from Pasco County Animal Services as a 'hospice case with an inoperable malignant tumor' growing out of the middle of his forehead making him resemble a unicorn. THE BEST news is that the tumor turned out to be benign and was removed by our vets along with a few other little old man tumors on his legs. Trace is all healed up and ready for his forever home! He is a 10 year old, 85 pound German Shepherd mix. still has significant pep in his step. Age hasn't squelched his prey drive so no cats or small dogs. Dogs his size and people are high on his favorites list! He loves walks and does great on a leash. He really enjoyed having his foster mom home all the time. He is now in boarding after she went back to work. Trace would LOVE LOVE LOVE to be adopted by a retired couple. Trace is our miracle boy and we want him to have an amazing retirement home with lots of love and snuggles! If you can give this much deserving man the best retirement home please fill out an application on www.maxxandme.org. Trace is neutered, up to date on vaccines, and microchipped. His adoption donation is only $150.\nTo meet Trace or any of our dogs please fill out an adoption application on www.maxxandme.org.\nMaxx & Me is an all volunteer, all foster home rescue and do not have a shelter. Please allow at least 48 hours for applications to be processed (missing information may slow the process, so please take your time and be thoughtful in your answers). All dogs posted are available (so no need to ask). We place dogs based on best home for each dog and not order of applications received. Email us at maxxandmerescue@gmail.com for updates and questions. Thank you for choosing rescue.",

All new animals (40/week) are added to the site 2 weeks before their availability date to give you time to fill out your adoption application and get the family ready to come out to the shelter that day. As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. \n\nPlease fill out an online application and we will give you a call as soon as we receive it. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our 'Visit' page for hours and directions to our shelter.

He is a wonderful fun boy, but he is also a lot of dog and though he loves people, he is a corso and is protective of his home so probably not a good match for those who have a lot of little kids or company over.

You may want to change her name to Cuddles, because that's all she wants to do! This adorable two-year old, 60 lb Staffordshire Terrier mix is looking for her forever home. She was surrendered by her owner due to personal reasons, NO fault of her own, and really deserves a change in luck. Athena would love to have a yard to play in. She is a great dog, potty trained, and highly intelligent! She loves to go on walks, play ball, loves swimming , and play tug of war, and will do anything for a belly rub. She is great at adjusting to the mood of her humans, and knows when it's time to play and when it's time to relax. She is extremely affectionate and loving, and always want to be with her humans. She's the happiest when she is sprawled out on top of you, cuddling on the couchshe will sleep right next to you in your bed every night if you let her. If you are looking for a dog to be your best friend, wants to do everything with you, and just wants to love you upAthena is your girl! She loves her humans and will never stop giving you attention. She sits pretty for treats and has the cutest smile. Currently she is being fostered in a home without other dogs and no children. If you have a pool that's a plus, she loves to swim or hop in the lake. She will need a home with a 6 ft wooden fence, no apartments, no other pets, and due to her size small children are not recommended Ages 16and older For information contact evegapfoster1@yahoo.com",

Bernie is a gorgeous 4 year old pitbull with such a love for life!\n\nBernie was rescued by an amazing foster after she found herself as a stray at the local shelter. She has completed heartworm treatment and treatment for her skin infection; Bernie has never let this little bump in the road stop her from enjoying her newfound freedom. \n\nBernie is an active girl who loves to go on walks and play with any toy in sight! When it is time to relax for the day, you can find Bernie cuddled up next to her humans begging for belly rubs, or chewing on a bone. She will thank you with a big smile and unwavering loyalty!\n\nShe takes weekly outings in public, rides great in a car, and is doing great socializing and working on a leash.\n\nWhile she is highly allergic to cats and cannot be in a home with them, she loves kids and humans! She does not currently play with other dogs in a group or pack setting. She would need to be temperament tested with any other animals because she is a typical bulky breed and enjoys playing gregariously.\n\n\n\nAll Abandoned Pet Project Rescue adoptable pets are spayed or neutered, microchipped, and up to date on age appropriate vaccines upon adoption. The standard minimum donation for dogs over six months to seven years is $200, puppies under six months is $250, dogs eight years and over are $100 unless specified otherwise. You can view all the adoptable pets and fill out an adoption application online on our website at bit.ly/APPRAdoptableDogs. For more information, you can email adopt@abandonedpetproject.org.",

Originally adopted from Wish Bone in 2015, he has found himself back in our care and searching for his perfect forever home and a warm lap to cuddle in!\n\nAt about 7-8 years old, he is house trained! Triscuit is loveable, but he sometimes loves a little too much when it comes to his possessions and his person - so no children. Triscuit would be best in a home with only one owner.\n\nTriscuit has a minor back issue, which should be easily managed with occasional chiropractic adjustments. \n\nThere's a lot of love in this tiny little 16-pound package. If you think he might be your perfect companion, apply today!\n\nHis minimum adoption fee is $255 plus a $12 fee, if 4 months or older, for rabies registration for McLean County residents.\n\nHe has been neutered, microchipped, vaccinated, heartworm checked, dewormed, and is on flea and heartworm preventatives.\n\nFor information about this dog's breed(s), visit: http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/abc.htm \n\nTo fill out our adoption application, go to: http://fs16.formsite.com/WishBoneCanineRescue/adoptionapplication/index.html",

            "description": "James is a happy dog that loves long walks, meeting new dogs, basking in the sun & bonding with his human. At home James tends to be low key. While he does enjoy keeping you company hes also content sitting in his crate playing with his toy dinosaur or chewing a bully stick. James is very proud to be house broken and will let you know when he needs a walk. James would do best in a quiet home in the suburbs. \n\n All dogs will be altered, microchipped, and receive age-appropriate vaccines prior to adoption. Please note that the listed location for this dog may not be accurate due to technical limitations of this database and we have transportation options available within 6 hours of NYC (so dont let location hold you back ! ) \n\nInterested in fostering or adopting? Need more info on this dog? The first step in the process is filling out an application on our website.\n\n\n\tAdoption application: www.nycsecondchancerescue.org/general-application/\n\tFoster application: https://www.nycsecondchancerescue.org/dog-foster-application/\n\tAdoption process & fees: www.nycsecondchancerescue.org/process/\n\tUpcoming events: https://www.facebook.com/SecondChanceRescueNycDogs/events/\n\tStates we adopt to: NY, NJ, CT, DE, PA, MD, NH, ME, VT, RI",

CONTACT INFORMATION FOR THE CURRENT OWNERS IS INCLUDED IN THE BIO BELOW.\n\nARCBCR courtesy lists dogs for individual owners, other rescues, and shelters wishing to place their Border Collies or Border Collie-mixes themselves.\n \nThese dogs are not in the ARCBCR program.\n\nARCBCR does not warranty any of the information provided about the following dogs. Should any issues arise, ARCBCR will not be held responsible. Fees requested and policies may differ from ARCBCR.\n\nGuppy is a super sweet, kind, and loving little girl. Gets along with everyone, loves to play and chew on treat-stuffed toys. She\u2019s learning to bring back her toy for fetch, too. She is crate trained and house-trained, walks great on a leash (with some minor pulling only when excited), and is doing well with basic commands.\n\nShe loves to play with toys in the house, wrestle with her buddies, tug-of-war, or cuddle on the couch. Her favorite things include: chasing or being chased, anything edible, sitting on various furniture, and posing like a seal for attention.\n\nGuppy is a silly goofball but is independent and adventurous. She\u2019s a good guard dog and will bark at intruders, but absolutely loves most people and all dogs. She's still somewhat puppy-like but has some good manners and some training now. She has become friends with our kittens, but only under supervision. She gets excited when they are rambunctious so we cannot say she\u2019s 100% \u201csafe\u201d around cats quite yet.\n\nHer strong hound nature makes her fairly serious about 'hunting' bugs, birds, squirrels and small animals outside. She also will eat things she finds like bugs, plants, etc., so she requires supervision outside and a securely fenced yard. Invisible or electric fences would not be appropriate for her level of drive.\n\nShe has moderate energy, and could run/play for hours outside, or hang out inside when it's raining just as easily. She would be great with someone that likes to walk or hike and/or has some time to spend training or playing with her daily. She would probably be amazing at Scent-Work (nose work), or Barn Hunt competition.\n\nGuppy loves kids, but tends to jump on them out of excitement, and may scratch or push little ones over. We don\u2019t have a lot of small children around to habituate her to, so that\u2019s where she is right now with kids.\n\nShe requires a person with at least a fair grasp of dog training who can be her consistent leader, otherwise she loses her manners. She would not be suitable as an off-leash dog (maybe only after extensive training), nor being left outside for long periods as she will try hard to get out and go 'hunting' on her own.\n\nGuppy has a problematic habit of picking up and eating things that she can find - bugs, hairballs, leaves, toy stuffing, small cat toys, plastic pieces, etc., so she must be watched and/or strictly kept from random things getting into her mouth, or she could be in for serious health problems. She\u2019s good with the \u201cdrop it\u201d command, but the drive to eat anything she can find is strong and if you\u2019re not paying attention, it\u2019ll be gone in a flash.\n\nFor these reasons, we think an experienced dog owner would be required for this wonderful, silly little girl. Someone with experience with Border Collies and/or hounds is ideal, with a securely fenced yard, and at least a minimum interest in dog training.\n\nShe is up to date on her shots, is spayed, healthy with no known conditions, and is around 2 years old.\n\nIn order to become Guppy's new family, an adoption application, vet references, and a home visit will be a requirement, in addition to the adoption fee of $300 (which will be donated to one of the great rescue organizations we\u2019re working with).\n\nGuppy is in the Salisbury NC area. If she seems like the perfect edition to your family, please contact: Robin at conservebalance@gmail.com \n",

            "description": "Doll is 4 years old and 30-35 lbs. She has been here since she was a little puppy. She and her sister were found on a nearby hilltop, having likely never seen people before. They have never gotten over this early lack of socialization. However, Doll is not aggressive. And she loves other dogs. Her best pal is Julio.\nShe hides from people she doesn't know. But there is a volunteer who has spent time with her and given her treats, and Doll always does a happy dance when the volunteer comes. She even lets herself be petted a little. It's possible she would open up in a patient home where she would see her people more often and would get one on one attention. It would help if her future home had other dogs, because she seems to learn from their example.\n*What people who adopt such unsocialized dogs need to consider is that the yard and house must be secure- it would be hard to get her back if she were to escape the yard or run out the front door. That is often the first instinct of very shy dogs in new homes. They need a little time to adjust to the new routine. They should improve once they see how their new home is much better than the shelter environment, and once they associate their new owners with the people who give them food and other good things.\nPlease find our applications and valuable information under 'Adopt a dog'* on our website: *www.beaglesandbuddies.com* and email your application to beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Let us know your preference of appointment day/time and which dogs you are interested in and we will do our best to accommodate and email you the closest appointment available. Please allow us up to a week to get back to you. Most appointments will be Friday-Sunday, 10 am - 2 pm, for an hour.\n*Note bring any other dog/s and the entire family to your meet and greet at B&B.* A complimentary training manual is included with each adoption, authored by terristeuben.com. Check out her website - she is fabulous!\nB&B is glad to be open during the pandemic. We know the value and comfort of a loving pet companion and are doing our best to help the dogs and folks who need them. We update our website daily and are always rescuing, vetting, rehabilitating, socializing.\n* We are accepting applications for volunteers to spend time with our dogs, hang out, sing/read to the shy ones, walk/toss ball with those who go to the playgrounds; cleaning, office work, gardening, and building/repair projects! *\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment. Please look at our website and make a list of one or more dogs that you would like to see.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf you have a question about adopting, giving up a dog, boarding, or volunteering, please visit the appropriate tabs on our\nhome page.\n\nFor more specific questions, call 626-444-9664 (please leave a voicemail if no answer) or email at beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Note that\nEmailing\nis always preferred!\n\nThanks!\n\nPlease note: If you are viewing this profile anywhere other than Beagles & Buddies own website, you are not receiving full info.

            "description": "Max Lucas comes from San Diego - he was a stray and spent a few months in the Humane Society in Oceanside. While there he had the advantages of some special behavior modification therapy - which proved successful. He is 7 years old and 30 lbs. His eyes are hazel.\nHe is treat motivated - and this is a good way to distract or re-direct his attention. He likes to walk and will cooperate with you putting his loose lead on.\nGo slow and don't surprise him - he does guard his food. So feed separately from other dog/s and watch picking food up or moving it while near him. Use a stick - distract him - toss a toy or treat in other direction.\nHe is well worth the investment to help him relax and trust people. Lovingly named after the two humane society volunteers who we worked with to get him.\nPlease find our applications and valuable information under 'Adopt a dog'* on our website: *www.beaglesandbuddies.com* and email your application to beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Let us know your preference of appointment day/time and which dogs you are interested in and we will do our best to accommodate and email you the closest appointment available. Please allow us up to a week to get back to you. Most appointments will be Friday-Sunday, 10 am - 2 pm, for an hour.\n*Note bring any other dog/s and the entire family to your meet and greet at B&B.* A complimentary training manual is included with each adoption, authored by terristeuben.com. Check out her website - she is fabulous!\nB&B is glad to be open during the pandemic. We know the value and comfort of a loving pet companion and are doing our best to help the dogs and folks who need them. We update our website daily and are always rescuing, vetting, rehabilitating, socializing.\n* We are accepting applications for volunteers to spend time with our dogs, hang out, sing/read to the shy ones, walk/toss ball with those who go to the playgrounds; cleaning, office work, gardening, and building/repair projects! *\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment.

            "description": "Rock Star is a beagle mix, 3 and a half years old and about 40 lbs. He is two tone---brown/white-- and an active boy. Before he came to us, he had several homes that didn't work out. In one, he chased the cat. We can tell you how to introduce a cat and dog who are not famliar with one another.\nIn the other two, there were nipping issues (no skin breakage) when new owners tried to restrain him by the collar. It is entirely possibly he gave a warning that he did not want to be pulled by his collar and it was ignored. And with a new dog we always recommend leash work. We would not want to be pulled by a collar, or the collar of our shirt - and if that were done and we gave warnings that were ignored, we might then punch the 'puller' or do the same back.\nYou gotta listen and pay attention to your dog - educate yourself on dog signals, behavior+++ The better informed you are, better teacher and respectful, the better your dog will be. He will do well in a home like this; He is eager to learn. One of our dog walkers has worked with him, and he loves to go out on the leash.\nNOW FOR THE GOOD NEWS: On his SAFER test assessment, he scored all 1's (A's) except a 2 on tag item (may be a little sensitive to high energy). He was described as jumpy social, active, sweet, bubbly. Enjoys going on walks. Needs manners training.\nAt this point he needs a patient, training savvy person or adult home. We'll keep you updated as anything changes. In the meanwhile, basically look at other dogs on our site if you are not up to meet his needs.\n\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions.

            "description": "Julio is a 5 year old, about 17 pounds- a brown beagle mix. He's pretty shy, and isn't really comfortable with people coming up to him unless they have treats. He's nervous around strangers. He gets along okay with the other dogs here, especially unsocialized dog Doll. He needs some training and time to learn to trust. But he does like people that he knows, and he would probably come out of his shell with one on one attention in a home.\nPlease find our applications and valuable information under 'Adopt a dog'* on our website: *www.beaglesandbuddies.com* and email your application to beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Let us know your preference of appointment day/time and which dogs you are interested in and we will do our best to accommodate and email you the closest appointment available. Please allow us up to a week to get back to you. Most appointments will be Friday-Sunday, 10 am - 2 pm, for an hour.\n*Note bring any other dog/s and the entire family to your meet and greet at B&B.* A complimentary training manual is included with each adoption, authored by terristeuben.com. Check out her website - she is fabulous!\nB&B is glad to be open during the pandemic. We know the value and comfort of a loving pet companion and are doing our best to help the dogs and folks who need them. We update our website daily and are always rescuing, vetting, rehabilitating, socializing.\n* We are accepting applications for volunteers to spend time with our dogs, hang out, sing/read to the shy ones, walk/toss ball with those who go to the playgrounds; cleaning, office work, gardening, and building/repair projects! *\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment. Please look at our website and make a list of one or more dogs that you would like to see.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf you have a question about adopting, giving up a dog, boarding, or volunteering, please visit the appropriate tabs on our\nhome page.\n\nFor more specific questions, call 626-444-9664 (please leave a voicemail if no answer) or email at beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Note that\nEmailing\nis always preferred!\n\nThanks!\n\nPlease note: If you are viewing this profile anywhere other than Beagles & Buddies own website, you are not receiving full info.

            "description": "Hi, my name is JINGLE and I would love to meet you. I am a Spayed Female Pit Bull Terrier and Chow Chow. The shelter staff think I am about 2 years and 9 months old. I have been at the shelter since Oct 28, 2020. ***********THIS DOG IS NOT AT THE SHELTER*************** Jingle spent the past month in a wonderful foster home where we learned so many things about her silly and funny personality! Jingle is a cuddly clown in the house. She loves to play with her toys, chew on her bones, and snuggle with her people. She enjoys some good zoomies in the yard but that`s pretty much enough for her to settle down in the couch with her peeps. Her foster mom reports that Jingle does fine sleeping in her crate but would MUCH rather spoon in bed with someone! This sweet girl came to the shelter as a stray, so her history before foster is unknown. Jingle enjoys going for walks and runs but she tends to be very excitable and vocal when seeing other animals. Her foster home was working on this behavior and she is slowly coming along but will need the help of a qualified trainer with her new family. But it is easy enough to find places where there are no other dogs for walks or she is pretty content to run and play in a fenced yard. Jingle would love a home with a big fenced yard where she can run and play as much as she wants. Jingle is looking for a home with Teens or Adults who would be comfortable interacting with a bouncy dog. At this point she does need to be the ONLY PET in the home. Due to Jingle needing her own space from other dogs, apartment living is not appropriate. This girl wants her own backyard to run and hangout with her family. Jingle is ready and willing to jump right into some private training with a qualified trainer who can help her work on her leash reactivity. If you think Jingle could be the ONE for you PLEASE EMAIL: DOGFOSTER@THEHUMANESOCIETY.ORG",

He loves to learn and be rewarded so continued training in a home can be made a fun and happy time. He's rides well in a car and is always excited when it's his turn for a car ride. Once the initial excitement of a walk is over, Tucker walks well on leash and enjoys a nice long walk. He is young boy with a lot of energy and would do best if he had a yard in which to run and play or some type of doggie sports such as agility or fly ball to keep him mentally and physically challenged. He enjoys the kiddie pools at the shelter and would likely enjoy swimming. He has a canine girlfriend at the shelter and would enjoy a canine sibling. Once play time is over, he's happy to snuggle with you. Tucker is estimated to be approximately 2 years old. For an appointment to meet him, please email adoptions@satchelslastresort.org or call 941-924-5070.",

Regina would prefer to be the only four-legged favorite in your home, but dont worry she has more than enough love to give. At the shelter, Regina calmly walks on leash and enjoys exploring the play yard. She will play a little fetch then returns for treats and affection. Regina is a gentle soul and always a pleasure to spend time with while waiting for her forever home! Regina seems housetrained and has been easy to leash and walk at the center. She is affectionate and sits for treats! Regina is looking for a home where she can be the only pet, and she will return the favor with lots of love! I weigh approximately 56 lbs.

Shawleens biggest hurdle has been meeting new people. She can be shy, guarded and sometimes defensive. However once you gain her trust she is super affectionate and loving. Shawleen has such a big personality and loves being the center of attention. She is house trained and loves going on walks and car rides. We think Shawleen would do best in a low traffic home with no children. She currently lives with 3 other dogs and is definitely the alpha. Shawleen is not a fan of cats or other small animals.

He can be quite affectionate and loves dogs his size.  He enjoys playing fletch.  \n\nHe can be nippy if he becomes frustrated so he needs an active and affectionate home.  He responds well to calm... he responds poorly to be yelled at or handled roughly.  \n\nHumphrey is an energetic boy who we're guessing has some Lab, golden retriever and chow in him. He was left behind by his family in a dirty, abandoned house in Puerto Rico.  Thankfully some of our rescue partners in Puerto Rico stepped up and took him to safety.\n\nHe has all his basic obedience commands and gets along well with dogs his size, but will need a family that will continue to provide structure and loving attention as he can be a loyal and loving addition.   No small dogs.  Cats are ok!\n\nHumphrey is neutered and up to date with vaccinations. He will need a few meet and greets. He is extremely loyal once he is bonded to his family.  He is also good with cats.  \n\nHis adoption fee is $350.00. To apply go to monkeyspack.com\n\nWe cannot adopt to MA residents :(",

            "description": "If youre looking for an easygoing, sweet dog to dote on with a funny, winning personality, then look no further: youve hit paydirt with Benny! Benny is a 10 year old Bully mix who loves chin and ear scratches, belly rubs, tasty snacks, and soft pillowy beds. He currently lives with a foster family and their miniature zoo. Hes a gentle giant that gets along with everyone: his Bully mix foster brother and ODH alum Thomas, five (!) cats, and a 15lb Flemish Giant rabbit named Julius.\n\nIf he could talk, Benny would wholly identify himself as a cat-lover. He likes to think he is young and spry, and loves to bark at the cats and chase them, which involves some hops and a quick shuffle in their direction. He quickly tires out and lays down after this. The shy cats in the household dont particularly care for this approach and will run from him when he does this, but the dog-savvy cats dont care, and will often let him indulge in some sniffs and a few kisses. Benny is also gentle with Julius, the aforementioned Flemish Giant, however, Julius is not afraid to give anyone a piece of his mind, and has established that he rules the house (dont tell the cats!).\n\nFor everything that hes been through, Benny is a very warm, agreeable, and loving pup! Hes our $12,000 dog thats about the final cost of saving his life after he was viciously attacked by another dog prior to coming into our care. Youd never know it, though! He has had no long-term ill effects from the attack, and hes a happy go-lucky guy that loves everyone. Hes also HW negative and neutered.\n\nGiven his age and size, Benny does have some old man arthritis, but he doesnt let it hinder him! His foster family lives in a two-story home, and Benny climbs up the stairs with a slow-but-steady confidence. He does need assistance getting down the stairs, which is made easy with a specialized harness. Benny will need ongoing care for his arthritis, in order to manage any pain he feels and keep his joints functioning. Currently, he receives weekly cold laser therapy, a joint health supplement with his meals, and at-home Adequan injections. Dont despair about the injections! These are very easy to give and he is the absolute goodest boy for them. He stands still and waits patiently, though lets be honest, that patience is probably reserved for the treat he gets afterward. Bonus: he can catch treats that are tossed to him! Hes got great eyesight and great reflexes, and as long as the treat is tossed directly to him, he will catch it.\n\nWhile his foster family would consider Benny to be housetrained, due to his arthritis, Benny sometimes has number 2 accidents indoors. These mostly occur when hes sleeping, though occasionally he will have a movement fall out while hes walking around. His foster family has given him the nickname Plopper because of this, and joke that its his middle name. Benjamin Plopper OldDogHome. Hes a good boy who tries his best to wait to go outside for number 2, and consistently does his number 1s outside, but he cant help it when he has a number 2 accident inside. He would love nothing more than to have a forever family that would chuckle about it, and then clean it up as if nothing happened. Bonus points if his forever family keeps his nickname!\n\nBenny would love a forever family to call his own! Hes great with other dogs, cats, and gentle older children. He has lots of love to give, and would love to meet you!",

She prefers dogs to people and is still nervous but improving. She is fearful but not aggressive - just shy. We do not want her in a home with children of lots of people due to this issue. She is a gorgeous do with great body condition and a very soft coat. She is a good alarm system because she barks when she hears  things like someone entering house. She has some separation anxiety but settles after a few minutes. She is still learning to trust and will approach for attention but will need a patient family who is willing to give her time to adjust to new things and people. Contact us for an application.

Both dogs are located at Lake of the Ozarks (Linn Creek), MO.\n\nElvis is a tan and white 3 1/2 year old pitbull/pointer that weighs about 55 lbs.  He is very loving and loves to snuggle. He is a great guard dog, but doesn't have a mean bone in his body around family or friends of family.  He would be fine with small kids, but probably not with small dogs or cats.  He is quite the hunter and loves to bring home turtles and anything else he finds.  He is house broken with a doggy door.  He is very possessive about feeding time, so if he is with another dog, he would need to be fed separately.  Ideally a fenced in yard would suit Elvis best.  He has been on a shock collar for about a year and it has prevented him from pursuing his hunting skills.",

The dogs are located at Lake of the Ozarks (Linn Creek), MO.\n\nDuke is a black and white 2 1/2 year old short haired border collie that weighs about 45 lbs.  He is very loving and craves attention.  In a perfect scenario he would be in a home without small children 0-8) and with a fenced in yard or room to run.  He is potty trained and is used to a doggy door.  Not sure if he would be good with a cat, but he gets along well with his pitbull/pointer buddy Elvis, in which he has lived with since he was a puppy.  Before we fenced him in, he would run, but always came home.  He has been on a shock collar for about a year.  A home where someone is home most of the time would suit him best. He is very protective of his home and family, and strangers would have to be introduced.",

            "description": "Mia resides at her foster mom's home. Please e-mail info@sheltertohome.com for an application, more information or to set up an appointment to meet her. *Mia has Evan's Syndrome, which is an autoimmune disease requiring a monthly visit the vet as well as daily medication. Please understand that if you are interested in adopting Mia, you would have to make a commitment to keep up on vet visits and costs.* Mia came into our rescue after being found on the streets. It appeared as though she was attacked by another dog. She has healed from her cuts and an abscess on her front leg. When it came time for Mia to be spayed, we discovered that she was pregnant with five pups. Her puppies have all been adopted. We noticed Mia having low energy, and we discovered she has Evan's Syndrome, an autoimmune disease. She currently gets a monthly blood test and is on a daily medication to help with her blood levels. Mia is a calm dog that does best with women, or calm adult men. She tolerates children well, but does not like loud noises and fast movement. Sometimes she is wary of men, but she gets along with the two adult men in her foster home. Mia enjoys going for short walks around the block, and playing with her chew toys. She is very gentle and loving. She gets along with other dogs, but should probably not be in a home with cats. Mia's adoption fee is $200, which includes spay and up to date shots.**All Shelter to Home animals are fully vetted per their age. We believe in pediatric spay and neuter. All animals will be spayed or neutered, tested for FIV/FeLV or heartworm, given age-appropriate boosters and rabies, dewormed, flea treated, and anything extra that is needed to give this animal a wonderful forever life in a permanent home. Adoption fees are usually $50 for cats and between $150-$250 for dogs, unless the pet is sponsored or we are running a promotion. Please visit our website at sheltertohome.com for information on our adoption process.**",

If she goes outside, PIper has to go to, even if she\u2019s only watching me from the porch; if not, she cries. Her weight fluctuates from time to time, so an adopter must also pay attention to those needs. Piper is great with kids (her foster mom has two, ages 4 and 5) and dogs her size. She cannot be around tiny dogs, cats, or small farm animals. Piper can not be crated for long periods of time other than nighttime (3-4hrs max during the day or she will be stressed).  \n\nAn ideal home for Piper would be someone who works from home, will give her the time and attention she needs and is experienced with the breed. \n\nIf you wish to apply for PIper, please email bjames@westga.edu, and your inquiry will be forwarded to her foster mom.\n\n",

She had a liter of pups under a strangers house and after a few weeks they boarded up the hole to where she couldn't get back under. I got the call about her and rushed over. After some investigating I found out that someone had come and taken her babies but left her behind because she was so scared. That was in Jan. She is still scared but as you can see by the pictures she is learning to trust every day. She loves other dogs and ignores the cats. She loves to snuggle in bed but once I stand up she is fearful and wants to run. She will need a family that is very dog savvy and is ready for a project pup. It will take some time to earn her trust, but when. you do, you will have a loyal friend till the end. She weighs about 50-60 pounds and is maybe 2 years old. It's time for her to have a family of her own.\nPlease go to funnyfarmrescueranch.org if you are interested in adopting. There you will find the adoption application as well as information about our rescue and how the adoption process works.\nAdoption fee (including transport): $550",

Luna has found her happy ending and now it is Potter's turn!\n\nPotter is about 65-75lbs, handsome as can be, cat-friendly and is great in the car. He has done fantastically when introducing to other dogs. His previous family did have kids, and we are sure he is hoping for a family that is willing to give him belly rubs and let him know he is a good boy!\n\nOur adoption fee for Potter is $150 and includes his neuter, current shots, and microchip.\n\nIf you would like to adopt this Amazing dog, please fill out our online adoption application at\nwww.amazinggracebullyrescue.org\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to call/text us at (850) 723-2037 or (850) 723-1431.\n\nDisclaimer: We are located in the Pensacola, Florida area and will consider local applicants first, especially with puppies since we use a vet in the local area.",

Bella is only 5yrs old but her neglectful owners just made her suffer.  We changed that, she is a spry little lambchop who is getting physical therapy at Beach Animal Rehab and had surgeries to help her knees bilateral and remove some bladder stones.  Bella is doing the best she can and manages to get down a ramp to the backyard to use the potty. She is pee pad trained too.  Bella is very sweet and grateful to be rescued, we've invested quite a bit of funding to ensure you don't have to worry about anything but love and exercise when you adopt her.  She connects instantly to her people, she is good with dogs and cats, she is good with kids over 12.  Bella's favorite past time is cuddling with you on the couch and gazing into your eyes.  She is definitely a foodie.  \n\nBella may need a doggie wheelchair as she ages but will remain strong if you allow her to walk on her own as much as possible.  She is on one NSAID pain medication for her arthritis and that should continue throughout her life.  She is WORTH her weight in gold and will make an excellent pet for anyone who cares enough to adopt her.  \n\nSubmit your application here: www.gonetothedogsrescue.org/adoption-application",

She will reach a plateau but any home that could let her swim (even in bath tub or kiddie pool) at home will do the trick.  She likes other dogs and prefers older nice calm dogs but will put up with puppies just fine.  We are looking for an experienced dog owner who loves the breed and is used to special needs pups.  Thank you for looking at our sweet underdog!  If you are interested in meeting Bella please complete our app: www.gonetothedogsrescue.org/adoption-application",

He has a rather slender muzzle, a black button nose, and short semi-erect ears.\n\nWiley is a very frightened boy being confined in a kennel and is not a happy camper at the moment :(  We hope that his owner will see his pictures or that someone will recognize him.  Wiley is likely a very different dog in his home with familiar family who love him.\n\nWiley weighs approximately 55-60 lbs and has already been neutered.\n\nIn compliance with the Ohio Revised Code, Wiley will be held for three days so that his owner will have an opportunity to come and reclaim him with proof of ownership.\n\n",

            "description": "Gucci is a fabulous dog who was rescued from a local shelter, where he'd run out of time. Gucci is great with other dogs and loves to romp with his foster brother Ricky (also available for adoption if you're looking for 2 dogs!) and sister Maisie. He likes to play fetch and will even return the ball. Gucci walks very politely on the leash, with or without a canine walking companion. This affectionate snuggle bug loves to crawl into his foster mom's lap for cuddles. Gucci is crate-trained, house-broken, uses a dog door, and rides nicely in the car. He's the total package!\n\n7/07/20 update: Gucci has become shy/fearful with new people when they're in his personal space. Gucci is working with a dog trainer to develop confidence with new people. By his third training session (over a 2-month period), Gucci was best friends with his trainer. He needs slow introductions to new people and a few positive encounters to warm up to them. He will do best in a quiet, adults-only household with someone who has experience with dogs and is willing and able to continue working with Gucci to help him overcome his shyness. No children for Gucci.\n\nGucci is neutered, current on vaccinations, heartworm negative and micro-chipped. Gucci will make a terrific companion for a lucky person or family. If you'd like to meet him, please complete an adoption application at https://legacyhumanesociety.org/adoptfoster/adoption-application/, and someone will respond within 48 hours. Gucci's adoption fee is $275.\n\nAge: Approximately 2 years\n\nWeight - 50 lbs.\n\nWe do not have a facility to house the dogs in our program. They are all kept in foster homes until they are adopted. Therefore, if you are interested in adopting from LHS, please complete an online application at http://legacyhumanesociety.org/adoptfoster/adoption-application/ and we will contact you asap about the status of your application.\n2/2/21 5:36 PM",

            "description": "Knoxville, TN - Chop is looking for his forever home! We saved him from a high kill shelter the day he was to be euthanized. Chop had hind end weakness, incontinence and was dragging his back legs. We consulted two veterinarians that indicated this was an old injury.  This was far from the correct diagnosis. \nAfter many months of negative progression we began getting more opinions from specialty vets and it was determined after diagnostics with UTK that he had subarachnoid diverticulum between his T9 and T10 vertebrae. Essentially the lining of the spinal cord fills with cerebrospinal fluid and causes compression on the spine. This diagnosis absolutely fits his symptoms and explains so much we have questioned over the last year.\n\nChop had the necessary surgery to help with his diagnosis. There has been positive improvements and he is now ready for his forever home! What an amazing Christmas gift that would be, right? \n\nChop needs to be an ONLY dog and we do not recommend a home with cats either. We understand this is hard to find, but as you can see, he is a sweet boy who loves life and loves humans. He also needs someone that can accommodate potty breaks frequently, such as every 4 hours to help with is continued healing. \n\nWe are begging all of our followers to please share Chop. This boy escaped death just in time, went through a spinal surgery and now he needs a forever home to help him thrive! He has such a will to live and needs a family that will love him and help him??\n\nAdditional Adoption Info:\nPlease visit our website for a detailed outline of our process: \nhttps://www.battleforthebully.org/\n\nThe Adoption Application can be found here:\nhttps://www.battleforthebully.org/adoption",

            "description": "Sadie was brought in from another rescuer who was unable to keep her due to her high prey drive for cats.  She was relinquished to a facility because she was in rough shape upon coming in for a dr visit.  One of the employees at her previous intake location fell in love with her and took her home.  Sadie killed two of the cats in living in the home.  For this reason, they were unable to keep her and started looking for other options to re-home her.  When we got Sadie, she tested positive for heartworms and tested positive for Ehrlichia.  She has been treated for both and is doing well.  She will need to be spayed before she leaves the facility, but she is ready to start accepting adoption applications.  Sadie is kennel trained and does well at keeping her kennel clean.  She does get along with other dogs here at the facility, but she will need to go to a home with no cats or other small animals.  She is very sweet, loves treats, and can be shy at first, but warms up rather quickly.  If you think you may make a great home for Sadie, stop in to visit with her and fill out an application.\n\nAll of our animals are cared for and examined by our veterinarian, spayed/neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, and dewormed. To inquire about any of our animals please e-mail us at rescuedheartanimalhospital@ymail.com or click on the link. Provide the name of the animal that you are interested in and your preferred contact information. We will then send you an adoption application and/or set up a time for you to stop in and meet Sadie to ensure that she's the right dog for you.",

She's good with cats too. She adores water and sitting/playing in the doggie pool. Cloudy's very smart and cutely mischievous ;-) She's an adventure girl with a big heart. Her stunning beautiful coloring we suspect is either from an Aussie or Catahoula background.\n\nHer adoption fee includes her spay, vaccines, deworming, and microchip. She's 1  1/2 yrs old. Cloudy has a bff at the rescue to adopt with her if you don't already have a friendly dog.\n\nOur process is to contact us via email DesertPawsNM@gmail.com (please do not call). We have an online application, we have a meeting at your home with your family members including current pets. (Yes we bring the pet to you!) a trial adoption and stay in touch - we love updates!\n\nWe primarily adopt locally to the Santa Fe, central ABQ, Rio Rancho and Los Alamos areas of New Mexico.",

I love to frolic in the baby pool, I love to play with all sorts of toys, I enjoy walks or runs, and I think fetch is great! I am a smart girl and can learn new things quickly- I know to sit and wait for my food and I am house trained. After a fun day, I love some good snuggles- I'm very affectionate. Although I can enjoy play time with other dogs, I need slow introductions to other dogs and may not pair well with some- I am not a good dog for a dog park. My perfect home would be one where I would be the only pet in the home OR where I get to live with a confident playful large male dog that I pair well with so we can play. Although I love walks and runs, I am reactive when I see other dogs on leash so I would also love to find a forever home with a fenced yard so I can also enjoy off leash play time without the stress of seeing other dogs on leash. Yes, I know I have some quirks but I promise that my big heart, playful antics, and goofiness are worth it- I have a LOT of love to give, pick me!",

I am not a super cuddly dog but will give you lots of tail wags. Although a bit shy of strangers, I enjoy being pet by people I know. I'm a smart girl and think treat training is a lot of fun- I already know sit, down, wait, and touch. I have 2 furry foster sisters that I just adore. I love playing with dogs around my size or larger and being with other dogs helps me feel happy and comfortable in new surroundings. I use a dog door in my foster home and would love to have one in my forever home. I am looking for a home where people will give me extra time to warm up and will give me lots of love and play time- let's meet!",

My foster mom says it's best to crate me when she's leaving for the day so I don't get into mischief, not sure what that is but she's the boss. I love being around other pups my size or larger and right up next to you, but I shine brightest in front of a camera! At the sound of \"1, 2, 3...\" I lick my lips, straighten my ears, and freeze for the best photo op :) I'm not just a pretty face, though. I follow lots of commands (\"sit, down, stay, wait, watch me, bed, crate\"). I'm house trained and crate trained! Definitely no cats or small dogs for me please though. Hurry up and submit an application to meet me so we can be besties!",

We think the other malinois is his brother .\n\nTwo weeks later they were returned back full of wounds and skin over bone. No medical treatment was given and Advar tested heartworm and distemper positive .\n\nCode red was on them and no rescues were taken them . So what do you do ???\n\nWe did not wait and took them both under our wings .\n\nIt was clearly that an amateur adopted him from the shelter . We as a rescue know the breed very well and adopt ONLY to Malinois experienced owners with a fully fenced yard of min 6 feet high .\n\nThese dogs are not for beginners and are NOT the years trained dogs that you see in populair Hollywood.\n\nAdvar is a great dog for the TRUE Malinois loved .\n\nHe is 2 years old and we will post him for now as pet only after the fight with his brother . He does not like cats.\n\nAdvar will arrive very soon in Middle Island NY after his treatment is finished .\n\nTo become his new family please apply today by filling in the adoption application to find on our website www.a-teameliterescuedogs.com or email us and we send you one",

            "description": "Follow us on Facebook for updated photos and more information on our adoptable pets!\n\n\nMeet Athena. She is reported to be a Pit Bull Terrier Mix. She is 3 yrs old. She is energetic, playful, loving, and a great snuggle buddy. She knows basic commands. She is house broken and free to roam throughout her foster home. She is potty trained however being as she was used for breeding her bladder can be leaky at times especially if she is excited or has to wait too long to be let out to potty. She came into rescue from a bad situation in which her reality was being locked up in a kennel, breeding, and malnourishment. That being said she has done amazing in her foster home. Athena needs an experienced dog owner who will continue working on training. She is dog selective and can be reactive to strangers as well out of fear/nervousness. She will not be a dog you can take into populated situations and will never be able to go to the dog park for her safety and the safety of other dogs. She currently lives with another dog who is older/submissive and they get along just fine. She currently lives with cats however she does like to chase them so a home without cats would be ideal. She needs a fenced yard preferably privacy or a home without neighbors in close proximity. \n\n\nAthena is vaccinated for rabies, distemper, and bordatella. Athena is spayed and is microchipped. Athena's adoption fee is $350 plus WI state tax!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Athena, please fill out an application at luckypawsmidwest.org. Once your application is approved, we can set up a time for you to meet Athena!\n\nLucky Paws Midwest is licensed and inspected by the State of Wisconsin: 402655-DS",

Me and two of my daughters from a previous litter were picked up roaming around town. My owners never came for me. I am currently in a foster home where I am learning to LOVE being inside and getting all kinds of special attention. I'm a quiet girl, I don't cause much of a fuss. I just want to be near my foster mama and follow her everywhere she goes. I have learned how to sleep in a crate at night. I am pretty good at letting my foster mama know when I need to go outside to potty. I don't care for cats and I tolerate other dogs but would prefer to be the center of attention in my new home.",

They could also be just so very heavy as she has had a rough life.  Shine is approximately 4 years old.  She was brought to our attention from our friends at HARTT.    She showed up and started to sleep in the carport of a home that belonged to a caring couple in Ton0pah, AZ .  She stayed for weeks, accepting food and water but not allowing anyone to come close to her.  Initially she had open wounds, a heavy limp and it was obvious she has had multiple litters.   Volunteers from HARTT were able to humanely trap Shine and after some bouncing around, Shine is now in our care.  We have really enjoyed falling in love with this beautiful soul.  She is as grateful and sweet as can be.  She will thrive in a home that has no other animals and a family that will allow her to snuggle up with them and to watch a good movie or to share a pillow over night.   We have listed Shine as a special needs dog as she will need life- long management care for her elbow.  She has to have limited exercise (just walks) and it is important that she does not become over-weight.  X-rays show  an extreme  arthritic elbow that can cause her quite a bit of discomfort.  But Shine will live happily ever after in a home that lives a low key lifestyle and will spoil her.  She does just fine with her sore elbow. If you are interested in adopting Shine, please take a moment to fill out our application:  www.povertyspet.org/adoption.   There is a $200 donation and all adoptions are required to have an application to begin the process.  Once received, you will be contacted within 48 hours.  Thank you!",

She has great energy, and can calm down when inside. She loves hanging out with the dogs and is very sociable with new dogs. She loves having a dog door so she can go hang outside whenever she likes. Fenced in yard is preferred, NO Cats No Children \nShe was found in a known area for dumping dogs, (fenced in area under a highway.) While she doesnt have any reaction towards other dogs, SHE NEEDS MORE SOCIALIZATION WITH PEOPLE. She MAY require a number of visits with any potential adopter so she can feel comfortable with them before an adoption can take place.  PREFER an experienced Chow adopter for her. Chows CANNOT fly, so that will limit who will be able to adopt this wonderful girl.\n\nALL adoptions are done FACE TO FACE, NO exception. If potential adopter lives outside the Fairbanks area it is up to YOU to travel to us, WE DO NOT SHIP DOGS\nAll adoption fee $400\n\nPlease do not email the rescue asking if he is available, all our dogs are available for adoption unless their ad states adoption pending next to their name. \n\nPlease review our adoption process before filling out an application. Adopters MUST be at least 21 to adopt Adoption Information can be found on our website at www.agsrescue.com Potential adopters must have an approved application on file before coming out to the rescue. IF no application fee has been paid your application WILL NOT be reviewed. To see more photos and videos of the rescues visit the our facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/ArcticGermanShepherdRescue\n\nPlease note that Petfinder's application is not AGSR application and cannot be a substitute as one.

            "description": "Cooli is a loving, smart 2-year-old, 55 pound Pit mix. She loves to go for walks and run around in the yard with a stick in her mouth waiting for someone to play fetch! She also loves her puzzle toys because she's a very smart girl! She takes her treats very gently too. Cooli's ideal family would need to be dedicated to exercising her regularly (walks, toy time, and yard time...hikes would be a bonus!). Due to her energy level, she will need a home with a fenced yard. Although Cooli loves people, she needs to be an only dog in the home so she doesn't have to share your attention. She has not experienced young children thus a home with no children or kids 12+ is needed. Cooli has wonderful house manners and is fully house trained. She is spayed, microchipped, up-to-date on vaccines and preventatives, and eager to find a family to love! If you are looking for an unconditionally loving, smart, energetic pup to bring into your family, Cooli is the girl for you!\n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $350 which includes routine vetting and spay/neuter.\n\n***Please note that our first step is submitting an application (it does not commit you in any way but allows us to discuss with you if you and the dog are a good fit). In addition, an important step in approving adoption applicants is to complete a vet check. Vetting of current and past pets is very important to us, thus we will be speaking with the vet(s) listed on your application to ensure that your current and previous pet(s) are kept up to date on vaccines (including rabies), spayed or neutered, maintained on appropriate monthly preventatives and examined annually by your vet.***\n\nTo complete an online application, please click here and email Crystal at cwoodlovepaws@gmail.com\n\n**If you're viewing this on Petfinder, please visit www.lovepawspg.org to complete our non-binding application.**\n\n2/2/21 11:48 AM",

MACY - A#43781416Foster's email: beccanock@gmail.comPhotos: Macy in foster care - https://photos.app.goo.gl/hDNX3onwd7qSRKHc9Macy in foster care pt2! - https://photos.app.goo.gl/4Yaj1yHySuzcZnrm8Macy's Slumber Party - https://photos.app.goo.gl/jyuc8FgX8iPA2XT26Another Slumber Party - https://photos.app.goo.gl/yoxDGg8fSm8iZYy29Macy's beauty shots - https://flic.kr/s/aHsmLisZYnPersonality: - Macy is definitely a morning person! She is always very happy when she wakes up, wants to give extra snuggles, and is excited to go on a morning walk.- Macy loves sunshine. She enjoys laying in the sun or going on long walks on sunny days. She can get a little feisty on grey cloudy days.- Macy eats like a champ (so far she has loved all dry food and treats), and she is completely house trained (no accidents)!- She loves going out for walks. She preps by stretching, crawling on her elbows and knees, and howling (it's very cute).- Macy likes to spend as much time outdoors as possible, and we have found that she is pretty happy walking 4-5 miles per day.- We have been walking her 3 times a day - first thing in the morning, sometime in the afternoon (3-6pm), and then at 8:30pm.- She loves having her neck and chest scratched.- Macy loves all toys - we haven't found a dog toy she doesn't like. She especially likes rope/pull toys and balls.- Macy will not let you eat peanut butter unless you also give her some!- Macy likes to walk at a brisk pace and she will jog or run if you let her. She did a 9:45min mile and can definitely go faster!- Macy is an excellent city dog - she isn't scared of cars, bicycles, or other people. She wants to meet other dogs and play when we go out on walks, and she doesn't understand what a quarantine is.- Macy does not seem to like small dogs very much. She barks when she hears high pitched barking or when she sees a small dog barking on the street.- Macy loves toilet paper - you have to watch to make sure she doesn't unwind the whole roll or steal a roll to run around with.- Macy also loves drinking water, and she will stick her head in the shower while it is on just to see if she can catch a few drops. - She does like a lot of attention and will nudge you with her nose, lick your hands, or bark when she thinks you aren't giving her enough attention.- Macy loves to give kisses, especially face kisses.- Macy knows \"sit\", \"down\", and \"come here\", and she is currently working on \"stay.\"- She is great during car rides.Intake Type: (2/7) Stray Weight: 47.00 poundsMedical Observation:(2/8) Senior dog with dental disease and fractured teeth, some cranial organomegally and low grade heart murmur, underweight body condition with muscle wasting r/o underlying medical/metabolic cause vs nutritional vs parasitic or other infectious. Single patch of hairloss on tail could be secondary to underlying endocrine disorder vs old trauma vs less likely FAD. Recommend promotion to rescue willing to perform senior bloodwork and dental +/- abdominal ultrasound pending bloodwork results and cardiac work-up. Behavior Observation: (3/12) Slumber Party Notes:Macy is a wonderful dog. She is so caring, sweet and very obedient. She was a wonderful snuggler and was just looking for attention and affection where ever she could have it. No accidents in the house. I know there was a question about being house trained, but she was great with us. She would howl a little bit to let us know she needed to go outside to pee. We walked her twice a day. Small quick walk in the AM and then a long one at night. She slept in a bed with us one evening but the second night chose to stay downstairs for the first half of the evening on the couch. She is a little bit of a snorer, but it was very cute. She was playful and energetic. She was not begging for food nor getting into anything she was not supposed to. We have an open garbage can in the kitchen and she paid it no mind. She walked wonderfully on the lease and was never timid, startled, or scared by anything on our walks. She was utterly unfazed and barely made a peep during her whole stay. She was never anxious in the car. She sat on the seat and just looked out the window. Granted we live in a quiet home, just my partner and I. There are no children nor pets but Macy was so peaceful that I can imagine her doing well in a lot of environments. Macy is an all-star and deserves the best!This animal is currently available from foster care through ACCT Philly's Adoptions Programs.

She is very, very high energy. She requires daily exercise every day. She has very loud bark, and likes to \"talk\" when she gets excited. When her foster family gets up in the morning and whenever they come home--she gets very excited and will leap with all four feet off the ground. This is just part of who she is. She could use some basic training. She has a very sweet spirit, and just craves attention. She is also very good with all other dogs, large and small. She loves her pack! Abby may be too hyper for small children, and not sure about cats. Abby\u2019s adoption fee is $175 and includes age appropriate vaccines, spay and a microchip. If you would like to meet Abby, please complete the application below. A fenced yard is required.\n\nhttps://toolkit.rescuegroups.org/of/f?c=DMBCNVST",

When Patty sees her favorite people or it is time to go for walk, she gets full body wiggles and her tail moves 100 mph. Patty came to the sanctuary from our LA center to enjoy a more laid back life. She is happiest when she is laying on her big comfy bed, relaxing after meal time. She loves her walks and car rides but really is a couch potato at heart. Her nickname is Patty Panda because of her unique black markings. \nPatty is a sweet senior girl who is looking for her forever home to spend her golden years as your one and only and in return she will be your number fan and always greet you with a smile.",

But don't let that fool you - this girl is a spry and energetic girl who enjoys time outside as well. She would love a companion person to take her on walks. Her ideal home would be a low energy adult home with just one other dog or on her own. She does take medication for a heart murmur twice a day, which she will take for the rest of her life.",

She learns quickly and at times seems to out think the people she is with.\n\nShe chases balls, does a few tricks, and really shines at figuring out puzzles and tasks on her own.\n\nShe is fascinated by the barn swallows that nest in the eaves around the house. She doesn't want to hurt them, just likes to watch!\n\nDaisy can leap really high and requires a sturdy, safe fenced in yard. She is part hound!! She would wander off quickly without a good fence. \n\nDaisy is about 6 years of age, spayed, and fully vaccinated. She weighs about 60 pounds. Daisy gets along well with other dogs close to her size. She is likely to chase cats and small dogs.\n\nShe loves people and kids and will play all day if you let her!!\n\nPlease contact Sue Sweeney: fairviewfarm@earthlink.net for an application\n",

I have a stunning black coat with unique sprinkles of white on my little face. \n\nI am with a trainer now learning all my basic obedience and he said he's never had such a smart pup as I learn what he was teaching me in two days. He said I need structure and exercise to be the best dog ever \n\nI  will be great with people who jog or hike or understand I do need plenty of exercises and to keep me crated when not home for training purposes which I love  and enjoy \n\n\nI love to run and play with other DOGS and like any typical young dog, and not a mean bone in my body with other dogs \n\n\nI am housetrained and Spayed with all my shots and Microchip\n\n Please fill out this application by copying and pasting a link into your browser\n\nhttps://poshpetsrescueny.org/dog-application/\n\nIn ROSCOE<  NY",

            "description": "Please contact Rhonda (vzcountyhs@gmail.com) for more information about this pet.Copper is a beautiful brindle plott hound mix and 2-3 years old. He's a sweet boy that just wants a family to show him love and attention as he was once a stray living on the streets. He's good with most other dogs with a slow introduction but does fuss a little if he thinks he might have to share his food. This is understandable as he once didn't know where the next meal was coming from. If he's fed separately from his friends it's no problem. Copper is crate trained and really wouldn't mind being an only dog as long as his people are loving with him. He's good with kids and does well on a leash. He's just beginning to learn about friends and toys and he's liking it. He would love a loving family with a large fenced in yard where he can spend his time playing and napping in the warm sunshine. Copper is neutered, up to date on shots, microchipped, heart worm negative and on monthly prevention. Contact Rhonda at vzcountyhs@gmail.com to find out how to make the fabulous boy a part of your family.",

His owners decided he should be put to sleep because Tyson bit the child in home that tried to pick him up while he was eating. Some of the shelter employees fell for this misunderstood little man and asked us to help him. That we did.\n\nWhile Tyson will absolutely let you know (by showing his teeth) when he doesn\u2019t like something (usually while guarding his food), he is easily redirected. He doesn\u2019t come gunning for you or looking to hurt anyone; his body language is pretty loud and clear. We have also found Tyson to be such a little lover. He likes to be picked up when he chooses to seek attention, almost cat like. He is house and crate trained as well as knows basic obedience.\n\nTyson is 6 years old and ready for another chance at life. This chihuahua needs a patient home that will take the time to get to know him and his quirks. We know there are those special humans out there who excel in handling fearful littles.\n\nTyson loves other dogs, but a little too much. He will usually chase them around and continuously hump them, often guarding them if you try to remove him. So while he\u2019s friendly as all heck with dogs big and small, we think to set him up for success, Tyson should be the only dog in the home. This isn\u2019t a definite  requirement but what we currently feel after initially observation.\n\nSo who is that special someone that can take the time to get to know our little dude? When not guarding anything, Tyson is easily handled, gives smooches, and loves to get all the pets. If you think you could be Tyson\u2019s human, apply today! Go to www.pittiepleaserescue.org to apply.\n",

            "description": "Oh, Dillon.? We are forever thankful this handsome dude kept hanging on at the shelter. He waited at the south side intake shelter for months, after having been found as a stray with another dog. His buddy was rescued but Dillon sat waiting, said to possibly need to be an only dog from how much he declined.\n\nFast forward to PPR being able to break Dillon out. While he still has that pent up energy at times, he uses it only in positive ways since being in the comfort of a foster home! Dillon loves nothing more than to run around and play nonstop with #fkingRichard and has a number of girlfriends too! Dillon is currently working on his leash manners. We would love to see him find a family to call his own, humans that are active and excited to start some training classes together.\n\nDillon is such a pleaser. He just wants to make everyone happy while buzzing around as a social butterfly. He is thought to be about 2-3 years old and is a beast size, not too big. While his home is not limited to the following, this is what we envision being Dillon\u2019s perfect setup: an active adult/couple with some experience and interest in training, with a yard and another playful female bully breed. Again, Dillon\u2019s bestie is also a chihuahua, but a chi with a big dog personality. We just know he likes to play, play, play.\n\nDillon has been waiting so long for his own humans. We know he will make the right people so incredibly happy. He keeps us laughing and thankful to have supporters that help us fight for those long-term shelter dogs often left behind. Dillon deserves the best! Apply today www.pittiepleaserescue.org\n",

She does fine with calmer dogs as she's not much for playing and wrestling. She would make a great dog for a retired couple who will let her be a lap dog.

But in the months we have had him, he has come such a long way. He used to be so fearful of the leash that he would bite when it was placed on.  He does not get super excited when the leash comes out because he knows it means a walk. He still has some leash training to do and will run in different directions because he's so happy and he can be somewhat leash reactive. He loves to play with toys and play chase with other dogs and is now up for plenty of belly rubs. Tanner can still be a nervous with new people so his new person/people will need to have some patience in the beginning while he adjusts.  He will follow the lead of another dog so he does need another well adjusted and playful dog in the home that can help him learn the ins and outs of the household.\n\nIf you are not ready to adopt just yet and would like to help in other ways, please consider clicking on the green \u201cSponsor Me\u201d button above to help this dog receive the best care we can give.

He is an active boy who is full of energy and loves to play. A little stranger danger to some but gets over it very quickly.\nHe is house trained and does well with other dogs He is an owner turn-over as his owners were unable to care for him anymore. He weighs in at about 28 lbs. Miko is in a foster home in Wichita, Kansas and will not be shipped. Requirements to adopt Miko are as follows: His adopter will have to be in the Wichita Metro area or surrounding area; no out-of-state adopters because we need to do a home visit. A secure fenced yard is a must; invisible fences not acceptable. A veterinarian reference is required showing that your present/past pets are up to date on shots, spayed/neutered and on heartworm prevention. His adoption fee is $200.00.

I love the fence, because I can roam and sniff as much as I want! I get along great with other dogs, so siblings would be great.\n\nI was with my original person for 13 years, and it's easy to see I was well cared for. I love my foster mom and follow her everywhere. It's pretty clear I also really \"dig\" (get it - dog humor!!) couches and chairs. Did you say you want a lap dog? Heck, pick me...even though I may have a few extra pounds on me, I am great at snuggling. I am about 68 pounds of love!\n\nI'm up to date on vaccines, dewormed and current on flea/tick prevention. My adoption fee is a bargain at $250! So please fill out the adoption form at http://pawsforlifenc.org/pet-adoptions/dog-adoptions/!",

I am crate trained and house trained, I even bark at the door when I need to go out.  I am lean &  really fast! I love to chase balls, chew on stuffies and my bones. I live with two full-grown foster brothers. We share toys and even food bowls with no issues. They are fun to play with,  but sometimes mom has to tell me to calm down because I will keep playing forever if she would let me. I have lots of energy and would do very well in an active home. I think I would really like jogging or someone to play with me a lot.  \nI have learned Sit, Lay Down and Come (Here) and sometimes will Stay when told, but sitting still is kind of hard.\nI like kids but since I have a lot of energy I would need to be watched around smaller ones.\nI would love to meet you to see if I fit your family if you would like to meet me too please complete an adoption application. \n\n**Amara has a slight fear of strangers entering her home space. It is easily. manageable with slow introductions on leash.",

            "description": "Boris is over this shelter business and ready to get the heck out of Dodge! He has understandably become more frustrated and anxious in the shelter, and he is a priority pup to get into a foster home. Based on some of his responses and behaviors, we think there is a strong possibility that Boris was exposed to harsh punitive training methods. And because of that, we make sure to keep our time with him super low-pressure and offer him lots of praise and encouragement! Boris can be a little tentative with new people, but just go slowly because he wants to be your friend. He wants to trust and to love. It is so easy to love Boris in return with his endearing demeanor. Boris has a short list of things that he really likes: squeaky toys, deli meat, and water fun! Put a kiddie pool in your backyard or patio, and Boris will happily lounge about for as long as you let him! Boris has his quirks and will need a low-traffic home without young children but respectful teenagers would be great! Boris has potential to live with other playful dogs but they would to be kept separated initially to allow him to decompress, and then slow and managed intros with which we can help! We know that a patient and compassionate person is exactly what Boris needs to increase his confidence, and we are excited for all the potential that he has! While whatever happened to him in his past makes us sad, we will do our best to make sure that his future is bright and happy. I weigh approximately 63 lbs.

He is a very mellow dog who wants nothing more than to be a couch potato. Buddy requires a home with a fenced yard, as he does not enjoy going off the property for a leash walk. He would be a good companion for someone who has a quiet lifestyle and is home most of the time. Buddy has an old weight bearing injury in his right hind quarter, so no athletics for him. He has been successfully treated for heartworms, is neutered, chipped and current on vaccines. He is housebroken, crate trained, and good with other dogs. Cats are unknown, but he is non-reactive to farm animals. All information about the rescue and adoption can be found at: ewenityfarmsbch.com.",

She is up to date on shots, spayed, house trained and crate trained. Merra ended up in rescue due to no fault of her own. Her mom loved her very much and took excellent care of her but sadly couldn't keep Merra when she was being stationed overseas. \nMerra has been with JHS for several months now, and she continues to get overlooked. She has lots of energy and needs a home that loves adventures, like hiking and swimming. Merra is great off leash and know all her commands. Merra would do best with no other dogs in the home, but she gets along with cats and doesn\u2019t mind other dogs out in public. \n\n\nThe Junior Humane Society is a non-profit, all volunteer, animal rescue group. For over 30 years, we have helped animals in the Gulf Coast area. \nAll animals waiting for adoption are placed in foster homes.

            "description": "Handsome Dipper is looking for a new friend and he wants to pick you! He is a very athletic dog, loves his long walks and playing fetch. You would think he is training for a marathon because he loves walking on a treadmill as well. He is a dog's dog when it comes to playing - he plays long and hard. Dipper is not a fan of cats nor small children, so keep that in mind. Dipper is very well mannered as he is potty and crate-trained and enjoys car rides. He also benefits from mental exercise, such as eating out of a slow feeder and Kongs filled with peanut butter.\n\nBecause of his athletic disposition, Dipper will need an active and confident handler who can set boundaries and funnel his energy into positive activities. Dipper is treat motivated so that will help with training and the bonding process. Dipper is asking for multiple meets with potential adopters to ensure his comfortability and to make sure this is a good fit for both Dipper and the potential adopter. But as we know, treats are his weakness! Once he settles in and establishes a routine, he will love you to pieces and you will have his absolute adoration. Are you that special friend Dipper has been looking for and needing? Come meet him today and see if you will be BFFs (Best Friends Forever).\n\nDipper is two years old and weighs 68 pounds.\n \nDipper's adoption fee is $200; he is microchipped, up to date on vaccines, and neutered. Some of our pets are in foster care and not located at the shelter. If you are interested in a specific pet, contact the shelter at (618) 939-7389 to arrange a meeting.",

When we  came  upon him we knew  we  couldn't leave him.  Leaving him would have certainly meant a disastrous outcome. Teamwork, a tired dog and three hours later Rocky James was  safe.  No looking back for RJ.  We  are looking forward to finding Rocky J  his  own man cave  with a  whole new owner.  Rocky has  warmed  up quickly  to our kennel volunteers.  He  walks well on the leash and although  he  doesn't seem to know any formal commands  he  listens  well and  catches on quickly.  Rocky  is  cautious  and a bit scared  of loud  and sudden noises.  He  can be  a bit unsure in wide open situations that don't offer  security.  One-on-one  he is attentive and aims to please.  Rocky  will  benefit from  obedience training so he can respond accordingly in new  situations and have a clear definition of who  his leader is. Rocky is simply a big dog that fits the description of a loyal companion. He  is available for adoption.  He is neutered, up-to-date on shots and microchipped.  His adoption fee is $200  which allows us to rescue and save another dog in need.",

His family chose to do the surgery to help him recover from the paralysis.  While he did resume his ability to wobbly walk he could use support  of water and physical therapy and our local neuro churopractor .  He remains incontinent and needs a family that can manage this lifelong. with no expectiations of improvement.  We have found a belly band helps and feeding him at regular intervals to time his potty needs\n\nRichard loves everyone except for cats.  However because he is more fragile he should not be in a home with small children.  Richard is fully vetted, neutered and microchipped.  He has some initial separation  anxiety and would do good in a home with a homebody or at least some pets to help keep him company.\n\nWe would like to see him go to a home that has IVDD experience in the local Chicago metro area.  If you would like to know more about RIchard or request and adoption application please contact us at:  RescueTailsAnimalWelfare@gmail.com.  Please realize we are volunteers that work full time jobs.  We will try to get back to you within 48 hours.\n\n",

He stayed at a vets office for a few months before coming to us. They got him fattened back up and even took care of his vetting. \n\nAge: The vet is thinking he\u2019s around 7 years old. \n\nSize: Terrell is around 70-80 lbs but is short and thick. \n\nCoat: Terrell has short hair but does shed. He will need bathed every few weeks. \n\nEnergy Level: Terrell is pretty laid back. Definitely enjoys his comfort and loves laying in bed. After he goes outside to do his business he\u2019s ready for a nap. \n\nMedical Info: Terrell has been vaccinated, heartworm tested, neutered, & microchipped. He does not currently take any medications for any conditions, besides his monthly heartworm prevention. \n\nTerrell\u2019s adoption donation is $175.",

            "description": "Cherry arrived on the 3rd of March after she was no longer able to stay with her owners. We believe she is a shar pei mix, about 2 years old, and 37 pounds. Cherry is a super sweet girl that has been in a foster home for most of her time with us. They have said that she is a sweet and affectionate girl. She loves to go on walks and even jogs but she is also chill in the house on her comfy bed. She is a quiet girl and doesn't bark much. They said she has adjusted well to their children but likely would be happiest with adults or teens that are a bit more mellow. She did well with potty training in their home and they started trying to work on basic commands as well. They said she hasn't been taught anything before but she is treat motivated and is seeming to pick up well. Cherry is a very sweet girl that will make a wonderful companion in a loving home.\n\nHSMC Adoption applications must be done at www.hsmcohio.org  Please do NOT click on the \"Adopt Me\" button on this bio.

            "description": "Rocky has made so much progress since being rescued in December. He was kept in a dark basement almost all of his life, where he had to ration his food and water, never went outside or received any affection. \n\nHe may be 8 years old but he has so much energy! He loves to be outside and go for walks. Rocky has so much love to give and will make someone so happy one day!! He has the best smile and just hanging out with him will make your day. He is so grateful for his new life, he can sometimes be a little jumpy. Therefore we think he would do best in a home with only older children. \n\nBecause of his past it takes him a little while to trust men. It is difficult for him to meet new people however once he gets to know you, he\u2019ll shower you with kisses! Rocky does have a bite record, but has never turned on someone he knows.  \n\nIf you are interested in adopting, we recommend you visit him multiple times to see his true, amazing personality! It takes time to gain his trust but the loves he gives is well worth it! \n\n**We do not do out of state adoptions**\n\nTo do our part to contain the spread of COVID-19, The Animal Haven is only open by appointment for approved applicants until further notice. Check our Facebook page for more updates as the situation develops. Thank you for your understanding, and we hope you stay safe and well.\n\nApplications are available on our website, theanimalhavenct.org. If interested, please send an application to Michelle@TheAnimalHavenCT.org or mail it to 89 Mill Road, North Haven CT 06473.\n\n\nFor additional information please check our Facebook page!",

            "description": "Blacky was fostered by one of our wonderful volunteers. He went by Charlie in his foster home and has grown fond of the name! Charlie was originally brought in when his owners could no longer care for him. Charlie seems to warm up to women much, much quicker than men. He was doing well working on potty training in his foster home, and will get there in no time with people who earn his trust. He enjoys laying in dog beds and walks well using a harness. Charlie would do best in a home with an outgoing dog that can teach him how to be a real dog (instead of a scaredy cat)! \nBlacky is neutered, microchipped, and up to date on all shots. \nHis estimated date of birth is 2/12/16 and he weighs approximately 45 pounds....All pets have lifetime sanctuary at Haven of the Ozarks. If they cannot remain with their adopter, they must be returned to the Haven.\n\nAdoption fees are as follows: \nPuppies under the age of 6 months - $125\nDogs weighing 30 pounds and less - $125 \nDogs ages 6 months to 5 yrs old - $90\nDogs over the age of 5 yrs old - $75.\nCats under the age of 6 months old - $75\nCats over the age of 6 months old - $65",

            "description": "Meet Bronx! This medium-sized guy is as smart as they get. He is between 1-2 years old. Bronx is very people social! We are happy about this because he had a rough start at life. He has been hand picked by a trainer & has been put through obedience training & is said to aim to please & is a quick study. He is a handsome guy & is ready to learn what a cozy house feels like. If you're looking for a loyal, respectable companion, here he is! We guess him to be a Staffordshire Terrier or mix. Bronx lived with children & is said to do well with them. We are only accepting applications for Bronx with the following:\n*Must have a privacy fence 6' or taller on all sides\n*No neighboring dogs\n*No children in the home under the age of 12\nBronx is not ok with other pets but great with people! He has a strong prey drive. Bronx was recently adopted to a family with young children & he does great with kids, but a child walked Bronx out front since they had no fence & Bronx proceeded to get loose when he saw a small dog running at large. Bronx needs an adopter that will make sure something like this never happens again. Bronx is truly a remarkable dog & needs to be set up to succeed.\n\nInterested? Please visit https://dogsbydebin.com/adoption-application/ to complete our quick online adoption application. His adoption fee is $175 & includes: Neuter, microchip, vaccines, heartworm test, deworming, & an offer of pet-healthcare insurance for 1-month.",

ROCCO - A#34252915Foster's Email: cajones2997@gmail.comDog Meets:Velva, Chapo, Bailey and Rocco - https://youtu.be/zAYmK0U1eNERocco and Passion - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VdZxMRu3EAPersonality: Meet Rocco! Rocco is a sweet old man who enjoys the small thrills in life. His number 1 skill is cuddling second to receiving head scratches. Though most of the day he has a super mellow temperament, if you hype him up, he'll happily play around with you. Beware: when too excited he's known to grab pillows, but he quickly remembers they're not a toy! He loves keeping people company in the kitchen, bathroom, dining room, and on the floor during in home workouts! Rocco has never shown aggression towards animals but does have a certain animosity towards FedEx trucks (???). He's perfect in the car as long as you have a window for him to stick his head out of; sniffing the wind is one of his favorite hobbies. Rocco loves every stranger he meets. As a lifetime dog owner he is easily one of the sweetest souls I've ever met.

Apparently I can jump high and the fence there wasn\u2019t sufficient to keep me safe. I will need love, patience and training to teach me not to scale the fence. I'm a smart boy so I know with your help,  I can learn.\n\nI am a 1 1/2 to 2 year old, adorable tri-colored lab mix who loves adventure. I am in search of an active, adventurous family looking to make memories. I am an active boy who can keep up with your high energy level and together we can be our best selves. I am a very sweet, loving, and loyal companion. It may take me a little while to adjust and completely come out of my shell, but I\u2019m sure we will be best friends! Sometimes I don\u2019t realize how big I am, so I do best with children 13 and up.\n\nClick on www.starsrescue.org to complete an application to be pre-approved to adopt this pup.  We will contact you regarding your application and date for meet and greet.\n\nOur adoption fee is $500. This includes spay/neuter, microchipping, deworming, and all age-appropriate vaccinations.",

In addition to looking like a sick toddler who doesn\u2019t know how to use a tissue, he was covered in urine and feces. None of this broke his spirit! He ate like a champ, responded well to antibiotics, and quickly became a cuddle favorite of volunteers. All the while we had been looking for a foster family, one who was truly dedicated and committed to training. Not just any training...one that is experienced with deaf dogs. Yep. You read that right. On top of all the hardships this young boy's body show he\u2019s endured, he\u2019s also deaf. Does that stop him? Nope. And it didn\u2019t stop one of our foster families, they couldn\u2019t have been more excited to step up for the undertaking\nEDUCATION:\n* Average energy\n* Learning hand signals\n* Sit\n* Down\n* Paw\n* Working on other manners\nACTIVITIES THIS CUTIE ENJOYS:\n* Playing with other dogs\n* Cuddling\n* Butt scratches\n* Jumping into your lap\n* Chewing on appropriate things\n* Toys: Kong, Nylabones, ropes, chewies, the Kong Wobbler\n* Treats: whipped cream, followed by peanut butter\n* Food: did we mention whipped cream and peanut butter?\nSKILLS:\n* Dogs: friendly but overexcited\n* Kids: loves them but needs time to warm up\n* People: cautious and needs time to warm up\n* Cats: unknown\nCHALLENGES:\n* Learning to love the crate\n* He's deaf, needs consistent training\n* Working on his confidence.

Does good on a leash but does pull. Doesn't jump. Knows basic commands, doesn't minds baths. \n\nCurrently she is fostered with small children (2 years old and 7 years old) but no other pets.  She tolerates the kids but has growled before at the toddler so proper pet boundaries should be in place to keep Ivy feeling safe.  She is a nervous girl, she does not like to be left alone or any distance away from her person.\n\nAt night she must sleep with people to relax; if not she paces and is destructive due to separation anxiety.  Due to this anxiety, she will not go into a crate and is not crate trained.  She does great on car rides and attends work with her foster mom.  Due to this, she is socialized to many different kinds of people and has shown some fear towards some adults.  She is protective and growls to show discomfort in her situation. \n\nKnown history:   Prior owner said she was raised with a pit bull (female) and they played fine although ivy was very dominant over the female.  \n\n.......................................................................................................................\n\n< Returned by Adopter due to COVID19 difficulties. >\n.......................................................................................................................\n\nPlease check out our Facebook to get bio, photos and updates on any of our dogs. @DobermanRescueGroupInc\n\nIf you're interested in providing a loving forever home for IVY please APPLY at: http://www.dobermanrescuegroup.org/adopt.htm\n\nOnly APPLICATIONS sent via our website are seen by adoption volunteers.\n\nNOTE: We will not answer questions about any dog until we have received a completed application.

Little Mama would love to find her forever family so she can have endless pets and romps around her very own yard!\n\nLittle Mama bonds to her people and will love her forever family very deeply. She would love a family that has a home and yard to explore and play in. She enjoys walks, cuddling on the couch, and treats! She is extremely sweet and her favorite things are walks with her person, pets and cuddles. \n\nLittle Mama prefers to be the only pet in the home so no other dogs or cats. She can walk fine around other dogs (walks or hikes) just as long as they are not in her personal space/within touching distance. She is UTD on her shots, microchipped and spayed. Her adoption fee is $250.",

Woody does well with other dogs. We have not tested him with cats and we do not recommend him for a home with children due to being fearful. \n\nAll dogs adopted through Troy Animal Rescue Project are up to date on vaccinations, spayed/neutered (age appropriate), and heartworm negative. All dogs are given monthly flea/tick preventative, monthly heartworm preventative, and are dewormed regularly. Dogs adopted through Troy Animal Rescue Project are microchipped. Adoption fee is $50. Home visit and vet reference required. Applications can be put in online at http://www.troyanimalrescueproject.org/adopt.php or in person at our rescue center.\n\nThe address for our rescue center is 34 County Road 2266, Brundidge, AL 36010. We are one turn off Hwy 167. If you use Google maps, type in Troy Animal Rescue Project and it will take you right to us. Hours of operation are from 10-3 daily. We are open Saturdays and Sundays.

He is perfect for an adult only home or a home with seniors who have experience with large breed dogs. He is a protector and can be wary of new people he warms up pretty quickly after getting a few treats and making friends appropriately. He is a good office dog for someone who works from home. Enzo knows sit, down, paw, stay and wait. He enjoys listening to Metallica, a perfect circle, and tool but he prefers the newer stuff. He will sit quietly by your side in hope you share you midnight snack. He is currently in foster with U.C.C founders and is doing great adjusting to home life, he is crate, kennel,and house trained If you are interested in adopting Enzo please fill out an application www.ulstercountycanines.com \n",

FOSTER OR FOREVER HOME NEEDED!!\n\nSweet Joey is a 14 year old Jack Russell mix who weighs 19 lbs. He has a mature cataract on one eye and a scar from an old injury on the other which leaves him blind. Joey is a great boy. He does not let this slow him down at all. All this senior gentleman wants is a nice soft place to rest and someone to love him. Joey loves to be petted and by your side. He does sleep most of the day but is very self sufficient and will quickly find his way around. He can also navigate a couple of steps to go in and out. His foster mom has some health issues and can no longer take care of him. Joey is in a temporary foster home but this mom works leaving Joey alone too many hours causing him to have some accidents. Joey would be a wonderful companion for a stay at home person or a senior person who just wants someone to love. You would need to be able to pick up 19 lbs in case Joey needed some help. A fenced in yard would also be good and give Joey the opportunity to roam around not on a leash. If you are interested in helping Joey please contact Vivienne at viviennejames@comcast.net or 615-943-7311. You won't be sorry. Joey is neutered, current on all his shots and microchipped. APPROVED APPLICATION REQUIRED TO FOSTER OR ADOPT. ADOPTION FEE REQUIRED TO ADOPT.",

            "description": "Hey y'all, I'm Otis! I'm about 2 years old and 75(ish) pounds of pure goofball and clumsiness!  I was chained up most of my life outside and I have some scars to prove it.  My foster family has kept me inside and shown me what a house full of love and family life can be.  I think I much prefer the inside.  Everything inside is new for me so you should expect that my head will be in every door and drawer you open.  \n\nToys fear me!  There is not a surviving plush toy in my foster parents house.  I will shred them and spread the stuffing around your living room like snow.  They keep buying them on sale though so I think they like the decorations I do for them.  If you give me a 99 cent squeaky ball, I will carry it for hours.  Squeaky balls are precious to me. \n\nI may be full of scars on the outside, but show me just a little love and I will be fiercely protective and loyal.  I am just now learning how to lay down and be calm next to my foster parents and they are working on showing me something called snuggles.  I watch my foster siblings snuggle and it looks amazing. \n\nI love walks!  I am good on a leash but sometimes I like to stop and ponder the world around me.  I am crate trained.  I am house trained and  will ring a bell and wait by the back door if you show me where it is.  \n\nI think I would be best in a home with another good sized dog to play with.  I\u2019m good with kids, but I have no idea how big I am and I don\u2019t always know where my feet are.  Older kids might be better.  I\u2019m not so sure about cats.  My current foster parents aren\u2019t sure about cats either so I haven\u2019t really met them much.  I am not food aggressive, but I prefer to eat in the solitude of my crate.  \n\nTake me home!  Show me the love I need and we will be the best of friends.  I just need a little more time to come out of my shell.\n\n\nOtis is neutered, microchipped, and vaccinated. He is crate trained and walks well on a leash, and is currently doing well with house training.

A dog that was left inside a crate at an abandoned property? You know what we see? Unconditional love, this girl wants affection and love so badly. She craves to be told she is a good girl, a warm leg to lean on. She is beautiful to us both inside and out. You will see that too when you come meet her and give her a chance. She enjoys a bath and belly rub, hugs and a romp in the yard but her favorite thing to do is hang out with people who love her. Sometimes it will take her a little while to warm up to new people, but the wait is so worth it. She is just a big love bug. She is not fond of other dogs. She can go for walks with them but not exist together in a house or come face to face. She is obsessed with cats so if you are interested in her, you can't have any of those either. She does have cancer (cutaneous hemangiosarcoma). It manifests itself with sores and blood blisters on her stomach and these will pop occasionally and bleed. Eventually the disease will go to her spleen. Her survival can be a few years with this type of cancer by the time it has spread to the spleen. Are you the person to love and provide care for Crystal for her remaining years? If so, please email adoptions@satchelslastresort.org or call 941-924-5070 for an appointment to meet her.",

Thank DOG for Moonsong for rescuing me; I was going to be euthanized because the shelter I was in didn\u2019t have an adoption program.\n\nI\u2019m fun sized, weighing in around 50 lbs. Being smaller I can get intimidated by bigger dogs but with slow introductions, I do well with dogs over 20 lbs. I prefer ladies over men and walk well on leash unless I see a squirrel! No cats or farm animals for me because I want to chase them.\n\nI don\u2019t mind being brushed but baths are not my thing. My foster family is teaching me with positive reinforcement (treats and praise) to not greet people by jumping on them. It\u2019s a bit embarrassing, but sometimes if I get overly excited, I pee. My tummy is sensitive, so I eat special kibble and like some dogs I can scale a 6\u2019 fence easily so I need to be supervised in the yard. I am crate trained and sleep quietly in my crate all night. I\u2019m good with children over 6 if they are respectful.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a fun sized northern breed, then I\u2019m your boy!     \n \nSee more images of Wilder on our web site here:\nhttps://www.moonsongmals.org/adoption/Wilder_11_19/Wilder_11_19.html\n \nSTATUS/LOCATION: Available.  In foster care, Boise, ID. Please contact Gina - gina@moonsongmals.org -  for more information about Wilder.",

We took her in, got her the medical care she needs, and she is thriving! She is very, very sweet with people.  We think she is dog-selective, so placement with another resident dog would be on a case-by-case basis.  Her diabetes is being well-controlled with insulin injections - her foster family would need to be able to commit to her insulin treatment and her special diet.  Other than that, this girl is just perfect - loving, sweet, playful, and ready for her new life! Our foster dogs are provided all the necessities by us (from their medical right down to their treats); foster families just need to provide TLC and a home!\n\nhttps://2ndchance.rescuegroups.org/animals/detail?AnimalID=15456376",

We do need the entire party to be involved when meeting available dogs, including every family member and dog(s) that currently live in your home.\n\nBrighton is a 4-year old, 35lb double merle female that is completely deaf.  While she has some vision impairments, she can still see plenty well enough to lead a very normal life!  She has been assessed by a Board Certified Ophthalmologist, and all of her records will be provided at the time of adoption.  Her future family will need to be prepared to have her eyes examined annually with a Veterinary Ophthalmologist.\n\nBrighton is a DIVA!  She is silly, sweet, and adores people while also having quite a developed personality.  She loves to get the zoomies, snuggle, \"talk to you\" through play-growls, and be with you all the time.  She is housebroken & crate-trained, but could still use some work on a leash.  She does better after she has an established routine & route (for example, going on the same path each time.)  \n\nBrighton tolerates other dogs, but she does not need them in her life to be happy, as she can be jealous when other dogs get attention.  She prefers to be the boss, and loves having a loyal subject that will dote upon her and let her wear the pants in the relationship.   Her ideal home would be as an only dog, or with a complacent, settled male dog that is indifferent about her diva lifestyle!  Brighton is fine with cats.\n\nBrighton's favorite past times are napping on the couch, sunbathing, playing with her people, and being your best pal.  \n\n\n",

She loves to explore, sniff and play with her favorite tennis ball. Plenty of blankets are a must, as this girl loves to burrow in them (being cozy is her favorite). \n\nCurrently K is in foster care, she has come a long way in terms of her health and behavior. She continues to build confidence and security every day, but will need to be an only pet in her home. There is a fence requirement for her adoption, or an in-home meet will be necessary to show management. K is on a special diet and arthritis pain medication to keep her comfortable. All worth it for this awesome love! \n\nAll dogs are spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccinations, heartworm tested negative (age 7 months and older) and microchipped. A senior dog's adoption fee is $100. There is a $5 fee for credit/debit cards.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our dogs, please fill out an online application here: www.heartlandsmallanimalrescue.org/canine-application.html",

            "description": "Cobalt is a happy, happy, sweet, adorable beagle mix. He weighs 24 lbs. Cobalt has the typical gorgeous beagle eyes and loving disposition. He gets along great with big and small dogs in his foster home, as well as the cats. He is still learning how to play with toys, but loves to hangout with his foster mom. He will follow his person all around the house and yard, just to stay close to you. He has a beautiful beagle baying alert when he catches the scent of a wayward squirrel in the backyard. Cobalt is potty trained.\n \nCobalt does have some special needs that will require a home where someone is available to provide care at ~3 hour intervals during the day. Cobalt came to ANLOL with a back injury and associated nerve damage. As a result, he has lost some of the use of his back legs. Crate rest and pain management have improved this and Cobalt gets around well, both walking and running (in a slightly wonky way). Cobalt also has paraphimosis from the nerve damage. He has undergone 2 surgeries for this, which improved it, but did not fully correct it. Thus he needs care every 2-3 hours to prevent further penile injury. Cobalt is a wonderful dog who truly deserves his new leash on life. \n\nUpdate: Cobalt has been diagnosed with pemphigus folliaceus, an autoimmune skin issue. He is responding well to treatment and appears to be headed into remission. It is a non-contagious condition which causes small lesions/hot spots on the skin. The original cause of his outbreak is unknown, and we do not know if it will flare up again after treatment is completed. \n\nDespite all of his health complications, Cobalt remains a sweet, loving beagle who loves attention, patrolling the yard for squirrels, and food. \n\nIf you'd like more info on Cobalt and his special needs, please click \"Adopt Me\" to fill out an adoption survey. By filling out an adoption survey, we will be able to contact you to answer your questions about Cobalt and to help set up a meet and greet! (An adoption survey is not a commitment to adopt the pet you are interested in.)",

She originally came to us from a bad situation a number of years ago. She was adopted out and returned to us recently. She will only be adopted out to a home with a securely fenced yard and with another small dog about her size that is outgoing and that will play with her.   She would not do well in a home with a larger dog.\n\nWhen Princess returned to us, she desperately needed a dental and ended up losing all of her teeth.   At her age this is unusual but it has not bothered her at all.   Due to skin sensitivities, we did allergy testing on Princess and discovered that she is allergic to many things.   This testing recommended the protein in her diet be lamb or fish and definitely exclude rice, soybeans, corn, flax seed, barley, and liver.   We also learned that she has a major allergy to storage mites which are commonly found in dry dog food or treats; consequently, she must eat refrigerated, canned or frozen food.   \n\nPrincess is very apprehensive of strangers and and especially new situations.  Since she completely freaks out if you try to put a harness or leash on her, leash walks are not an option. This is not an isolated behavior and was one of the main reasons that she was returned to us.   A fenced yard is definitely a must.   Small children make her very nervous so she will need an adult ONLY home.   She also is much better with women so initially her primary caregiver should be female most likely to help her adjust quicker.  Like many dogs, Princess will need time to adjust to a new home and a person with the patience to make that happen.  When she moved to my house to foster it took her about 5 days to come out of her \"safe place\" in my spare bathroom but once she did she started making progress daily.  She loves food so that is always helpful since she started to be happy to see me around day 3 because I would give her treats and food.  She wants to love her person but just needs time to come around.  \n\nAs of this writing, she has been with me about 6 weeks.  She is doing great.  She lays up on the couch at night and she would be happy if I would pet her the entire time.  But once I stop, she lays down and dozes off.  She follows me around the house and sleeps next to my bed in a little dog bed with a fluffy blanket on it so she can snuggle under the covers if she wants.  She likes to play chase and would love a dog that will play with her that is about her size.  She seems to especially want to play with my Chihuahua more than my other dogs and I am assuming that is due to her being the same size.   She is honestly doing amazing.  I can pick her up with no issues now and she even snuggles in a bit.  She will take time but she is worth it.  She is a great girl that is going to make someone very happy as long as they give her the time she needs to feel safe and loved.  \n\n\nMEDICAL NOTES: Princess had a small mass removed from her rear leg. Pathology revealed that it was a low grade mast cell tumor. She is doing well and her prognosis is good. Of course, there is always a possibility of recurrence with further treatment being needed but it is not expected.   Due to this unknown, if Princess is adopted and there is another tumor that pops up, Canine Castaways will treat the issue at our vet's office in Arcadia at our expense.\nPrincess also had been tested for allergies due to chronic skin issues. She is allergic to many things both environmental and food. As a result, she will need to remain on diet of lamb or fish as the main protein. The diet changes have made a big difference and she is not currently taking any medications.\n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting please complete our Adoption Application by copying and pasting the following link into your web browser: http://www.caninecastaways.org/adoption-application\n\nFor a full list of dogs we currently have for adoption use this link:  https://www.caninecastaways.org/adoptable-dogs\n\n\nMEDICAL INFO:\n\n\nThe following has been or will be done for this dog...\n- Basic Exam by Veterinarian\n- Spayed or Neutered\n- Heartworm Tested\n- Placed on heartworm preventive\n- Basic Bloodwork\n- Urinalysis\n- Microchipped\n- Intestinal Parasite Exam and medication\n- Vaccinations\n- Placed on Flea preventive\n\n\nADOPTION DONATION: $250\n\n\nThis adoption donation helps to cover the vet expenses for this dog including heartworm preventive which is dispensed at the initial vet visit and then goes with the dog at adoption.

Twiggy has lots of energy and is very, very fast.  He would do best in a home with a fenced yard as daily walks may not give him the exercise he needs.  Another dog his size to play with would be great.  He can be a bit bossy and will need further work on boundaries.  A home without small children would also be best for Twiggy.  He is crate trained and is doing very well with his house training.  \n\nNOTE:  Twiggy is a dog can be tricky with some things and is going to need a specific type of home and we will be limiting the area for adoption for him due to this.   At this time we will only consider homes in the following counties:  Manatee, Sarasota, Desoto.   We also do require that you have current or recent dog history.\n\nDue to COVID-19 we are a little more limited on volunteers and the availability (and safety) of home visits.   Local applications are given first priority and some out of town areas will not be able to be processed.\n\nAt this time, we will only be able to process applications that have an excellent current vet history.

Unfortunately my first owners were not able to keep me, as they were moving and felt it was not the right situation for me, so that nice folks at NEBR came along to help me find a new forever home.\nI'm about 1.5 years old, I love to play (with you or with another dog), and I'm smart too...I know lots of tricks - sit, down, high five, and I can learn lots more.  I'm a pretty athletic guy too, so if agility is your thing, I think I might be good at that too.  I walk well on a leash as long as I have my no pull harness on.  Of course, I'm crate trained and house trained, and I'm very loving (at least my foster mom says so).  I need a fenced in yard so that I can run and hopefully play with you. \nI have been neutered, am up to date with my vaccinations, am heartworm negative and on prevention and I'm microchipped too!\nIf you're looking for a sweet, loving and active boy, please take a moment and fill out an online application at www.nebrittanyresuce.org  Thank you and we look forward to hearing from you.",

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: 5/23/2019\nReason for being in rescue: Owner release- Owner does not want.\nFoster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SC\nSpecial Needs? Sasha came to us grossly underweight and with heartworms. Her foster mom has been working with her and her weight is back up to normal. Sasha is being treated with the soft kill method of heartworm treatment (monthly Heartguard only) and is now testing Heartworm negative.\nWeight: est 45 lbs\nHeight: est 22 in\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $300\n\nFence needed? Yes without exception. 4' chain link is fine. She is not a climber although she likes to see if she can find the moles in the yard. A fenced in yard is not for you to leave your dog outside in it all day with no protection and with no human interaction. It is your dog's safe space for romping, playing and being the free spirited creature all dogs were meant to be - with you right there enjoying the time together with your canine best friend.\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Sasha has came a long way since coming to CPR and going to foster with our groomer, Amanda. She is a lot of dog, with a lot of energy, intelligence and curiosity. The husky breed is not for the faint of heart although with the right owner, she will thrive. She has with our groomer, a very experienced dog owner. Sasha needs a home with no children under the age of 15. She has a strong personality and a can be a bit of a challenge. Her previous owner did not give her the structure and discipline she needed so we're correcting all of that.\n\nSasha would do best in a home where there are no small dogs - it's not that she's mean or aggressive, but she is large and she likes her personal space. She co-exists now with several small dogs who are clingy/spoiled and don't know boundaries and she routinely corrects them and tells them to get out of her space. She simply does not want to share her home with little, irritating ankle biters. Large dogs are another subject all together. Her best friend is Dawson, an extra large shepherd mix who is also up for adoption. They would love to go together if you want two. They romp, play, run and wrestle and have a grand old time. With a dog her energy and size levels, she is an amazing companion dog.\n\nWhat is my personality like? Intelligent - inquisitive - a little bit naughty and a little bit nice! Sasha loves people, and loves when anyone has food or treats! Trash can mining is a favorite past time. Sasha can not be left alone when her foster mom goes out. Unsupervised in the house, all that intelligence and inquisitive nature comes full force and she will get into something. You won't be happy with what she finds to get into.\n\nIf Sasha was a human, she may have ended up in military school to learn that it's okay to say Yes Sir and Yes Ma'am and that discipline and routine are good life arrangements that give you confidence. She also needs someone who is experienced in basic training and would love to be involved in a dog sport like nosework or weight pull. Sasha still has some quirks and needs to be consistently and gently reminded that she does not rule the house. Sasha is crate trained, walks well on a leash and has the most stunning blue eyes you've ever seen.\n\nSasha loves to be outside, so exercise is a must for her. She is pretty good about strangers also, she is just a very curious dog and wants to sniff and smell to see where you have been!\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Friendly - she greets people nicely and politely. She's not a run up and jump on you kind of girl. She allows loving and petting but she does not need it unless she is trying to get you up so she can go out - she's definitely a morning girl and she's all over you. She is not a stuffed animal to be squeezed on. She has her own dance space and wants you to stay in your space and she will stay in hers. If you invade her space, she will tell you she doesn't like it by air snapping at you. She also can be food aggressive at times with other dogs. She has never been aggressive with humans but her foster mom also does not take food away once it's given. Remember, Sasha was grossly underweight when coming to CPR .At some time in her life, food was not guaranteed. She remembers. She takes treats with a lot of enthusiasm and you have to watch your hands! However, she eats a reasonable pace and does not bolt her food.\n\nOther tips and tidbits: Est Birthdate 5/23/2017.\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

She is a sweet girl, a very frightened of humans but is but is making some progress.  She will probably remain small to medium (@40lbs) sized but this is a best guess. We would like her to go to a home with a fenced in back yard and someone with experience in working with dogs that are scared and untrusting of humans.  She does well with other dogs and  cats.  Her adoption fee is $400.00 which includes her transport fees, age appropriate vaccines, spay and microchip.  If interested in adopting/meeting her, please request for an adoption application and please indicate your experience in dealing with frightened dogs.  If you do not indicate your experience, no one will respond to you.\n\nWe are not a shelter.  Because all our pets are in private foster homes, we require everyone to fill out an adoption application and have their references checked, prior to meeting our pets.  If you are interested in this pet, please email info@k9sinneed.com for an adoption application.  NJ RESIDENCE ONLY PLEASE.<\n<br><br>\nPlease note:  Dog breed listings and their descriptions are best guess' and not guaranteed.  Although we make ever effort to give you an honest description, the breeds and sizes are based on our experience and opinions.",

Please EMAIL apassionforpaws@gmail.com and wait for confirmation of your appointment before coming to visit the Akita Ranch. We also request that visitors wear masks. Yoshi is a young male Akita weighing approximately 80 lbs. He is very handsome and still growing. During the first few months of his life he only had limited exposure to the world outside of his previous home. Yoshi is highly intelligent and wants someone who will stimulate his mind and teach him new skills. It takes him a little bit of time to warm up to strangers and get used to them. Because of his cautious demeanor, he would do best in a calm and consistent environment with a good human leader to make him feel safe and help him develop into a more well rounded canine. He would do best with a breed experienced home that respects his space and positively encourages him as he learns what this world has to offer. He is confident and a happy easy keeper, that loves exploring. He would thrive with someone who believes in him as he learns what being a loved and accepted doggy is like. No children under 18 please, but he seems to be friendly with other social female dogs his own size!!Visit Akita Ranch 28930 Ellis Ave, Romoland, CA, Open 10-5 daily BY APPOINTMENT ONLY.

This adorable guy with the goofy sideways eyes is a sucker for butt rubs and will back up into you, trying to sit in your lap as you pet him! He's hilarious! Anxious on his lead at the start of his walk, Baxter's walking etiquette improved exponentially once he conducted business. He knows sit, will stay and in general is composed and well mannered and seems to enjoy car rides. Baxter's glances and loving gaze are irresistible. His adoption fee is $150. Baxter's altered, has been wormed, vaccinated and microchipped. He tested positive for heart worm and lyme disease. Baxter's successfully completed treatment for both. Additionally, we're working on improving his skin condition. Baxter is a true sweetheart who loves the companionship of people. His heart is wide open; are your arms ready to embrace this soulful guy?",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Name - Opal\n\nAge - Young Adult\n\nWeight - approx. 60lbs\n\nSpecial Needs - Yes. Opal is deaf. She also has a \"wonky\" front right leg. This is a growth deformity. At this time, amputation is not recommended as it does not prohibit her from running or playing normally\n\nOther dogs - Enjoys going on pack walks. Recommended as the only dog in the home. Supervised play dates OK\n\nCats - No cats - will chase\n\nKids - Loves children. However older children in the home is recommended due to her size and strength - her tail is like a whip and she's such a happy girl, the tail is almost always wagging. We do not want a young child being hurt accidentally\n\nBackground - abandoned on the side of the road. She was adopted briefly but it was not the right dynamic with the resident dog and so she was returned to ITP after about a month\n\nCrate trained - She is great in her crate. Just make sure she has plenty of bones to chew and she will hardly make a peep. She will even put herself in the crate when she's ready to rest\n\nLeash trained - Opal is trained on the slip leash, martingale collar and e-collar. We use the vibration setting ONLY for recall when in the backyard. She occasionally gets overly excited and will grab the leash while walking - her fosters are working on correcting this behavior\n\nHousebroken - Yes. She has not had any accidents and will go to the door when needing to go out\n\nEating Habits - Not picky at all. Does use a slow feeder bowl to keep her from wolfing her food down. Must be given a metal bowl, as she will chew a plastic one. Very treat motivated\n\nCommands known - Opal is trained with hand signals (sit, stay, come) and with the vibration collar for recall\n\nCar rides - Rides pretty well in the car\n\nBath time - Opal loves water! She will try to bite the hose if possible. She enjoys being pampered\n\nAffectionate - Very affectionate. She's affection motivated almost as much as being treat motivated. She just loves cuddling and snuggling up next to you\n\nActivity level - Opal is on the higher energy level in the sense that she has bursts of energy. She'll play play play for 30 minutes or so then crash for a few hours. Then get up and run laps around the yard. A house with a yard is preferred\n\nPlay style - Opal will entertain herself with toys in the yard. She'll run laps and throw toys up in the air. She just loves tug and could do that for hours. She's incredibly strong though so we have developed a way to play with her appropriately with the help of a behavorist\n\nBad habits - Opal doesn't really have bad habits in the normal sense. But because of her disability, she can be a bit more challenging than a \"normal\" dog. She can be stubborn and is very strong so she'll need a strong handler, especially while out on walks. She is reactive to cars - we're not sure exactly why, maybe because she can't hear them and they \"sneak up\" on her. She will bark at them and in her over-excitement bite at the leash. We are working on desensitizing her and correcting this behavior\n\nRedeeming qualities - Opal is just a happy-go-lucky dog for the most part. She's just genuinely so sweet and lovable\n\nBest feature - Her pretty green eyes and her cute little pout\n\nWhat Foster Mom/Dad wants you to know -\n\"Opal is a special dog. Not only because she is special needs but because she is just so loving. She just adores people and you can see her face light up when she looks at you. She still has puppy energy and will entertain you with her playful antics. Watching her do zoomies around the yard is hilarious. Just a warning - she does snore but it's so funny to walk in the room and the other dogs are barking or the kids are yelling and she's just curled up snoring away. She doesn't really have a care in the world - she's just happy and ready to play. She loves to snuggle and just loves when you love on her. She is very strong and we've had to adapt to how we handler her in light of her deafness. She is incredibly smart though and really is eager to please so she picks up on new training pretty quickly. I would love to see her be adopted into a home that could provide the ongoing structure and exercise she needs. And of course, a home to give her unconditional love because she really does deserve it\n\nPlease consider sponsoring Opal with either a one-time or monthly tax-deductible donation.

            "description": "***  Please read entire post ***\n\nThe first step is to complete an adoption application via our website, www.cofas.org (click on Adoption Information, Available Dogs, Dog Adoption Application). All of our adoptable animals are in foster homes. \n\nWe do not arrange meet and greets until we have an approved application on hand.\n\nOnce we have reviewed your application we will get back to you as soon as possible. \nWe have the right to decline an application if it is not a good fit for that particular animal. \n \n___\n\nNot sure why we still have this beauty in our system?!  \nViola is just an adorable little shorty girl.  She came from a rural shelter where she was picked up as a stray and was in pretty bad shape. \n\nBeautiful Viola is looking for the perfect home.  \nThat perfect home has a fenced in yard for her to run and play in.  She would enjoy a family that is home a lot with a quieter household.  \nShe loves to snuggle with you on the couch.    But not saying she does not like to be outside or go for walks....she loves her family time.\nApartment life would probably not suit her.\n\nIt is apparent that little Viola had a rough life being used as a breeder and obviously kept locked up in a cage based on the soars that covered her body and the condition she was in when we got her.  She is happy and healthy now.  In spite her sad past she is extremely sweet and just loves people.   \n\nWe would really like for to be the only dog so she can get all the attention she deserves.  Previous adoption trials with current dogs did not go well....not her fault. \n\nShe is great with people of all ages but we are recommending a home with  children 8 years and older.  She is good with cats that really like dogs.  Her current foster home has two 'dog proof' cats that just love her and she is very good with them.\n\nViola is estimated at about 5 years old and weighs about 50lbs.\nViola does have a functional heart murmur but has been checked out thoroughly by our vet and has no clinical signs of any issues related.\n\nHer pictures do make her look a lot bigger than she is (she is very short and stout).  She is just adorable!\n\nViola is up to date on her heart worm, flea/tick preventatives, spayed, up to date on vaccinations, micro chipped and had a dental cleaning.\n \n\nAny questions about Viola, please contact her foster Mom at kittypuppylv@aol.com\n\n\n\n__________________________________________\n\nNot yet ready to adopt? You can sponsor a pet now to help pay for medical expenses, special diets, toys and treats, emergency medical care, etc., to provide for him or her during foster care. Our adoption fee rarely covers our expenses, so any size donation is appreciated! Click the Sponsor Me! logo to make a donation. You can also donate by check or Paypal by visiting our website at www.cofas.org \n\n\n All of our dogs are fostered in our homes so we know their temperaments. They are spayed or neutered, up to date on shots, de-wormed, heartworm tested (and treated if necessary), and on flea and heartworm prevention. Our adoption fee begins at $195.00 for all of our dogs and puppies. Our goal is to match our animals to the best home possible. Please email info@cofas.org for more information. You can also fill out an application at www.cofas.org",

            "description": "**COURTESY POST for Orphans of the Storm Animal Shelter**\n\nThea, short for Theadora, is a beautiful and intelligent 3 year old gal who is staying with us for training and socialization. Thea is a very playful young lady that loves running off leash and exploring the great outdoors with her fellow foster pups. Her favorite game to play is fetch and she does the cutest little hops when chasing after the tennis balls. She also enjoys going on nice, long walks but refers running in the yard much more. Thea is a rockstar at obedience and picks up on new tricks fast, especially when she is guaranteed some tasty treats as a reward! She is potty trained, walks well on leash, knows her training commands, does well with most dogs, and is just so much fun to be around.\n\nThea's ideal owner is someone who has breed/dog experience due to her nervousness around strangers. She needs a confident leader who will be her voice and say, \"please do not pet,\" and will not force her to meet new people as she prefers to get affection and hang out with her family only. Thea also needs an owner who will be patient with her as it takes time for her to warm up, but once she does, she is your most loyal and trusting friend! Overall, Thea would do best with a family who is willing to continue her training and learn alongside her, and in an all-adult home with NO CATS and NO CHILDREN.\n\nContact (847) 338-3252 or email info@redemptionroadinc.org if you're interested in meeting the lovely Miss Thea! 1/27/21 10:12 PM",

Jada came to the Animal Care League as a local stray after her owners moved and abandoned her in an empty house. Understandably, Jada was heartbroken and confused when she first arrived and was unsure if she could trust us - After loving her through her transition, Jada has shown us what a great girl she is. Jada can still be shy when she first meets you, after being abandoned by the people she loved who can blame her, But once Jada gets comfy she shows what an affectionate and smart girl she is - She even knows \"sit\" and \"paw\"! What a smartie pants! Our sweet girl would be her happiest in an experienced dog-savvy adult only home that will understand that she's been through an ordeal and will just show her what love and trust is. We have no doubt after you meet our Jada lady, you will love her just as much as we do. Come meet Jada today!",

We think Bernie\u2019s family just didn\u2019t want him anymore. That is so sad as Bernie is a sweet boy who just wants to be close to his human.  He sleeps with his foster mom and gets along great with the other pugs in the home.  Bernie deserves a forever home that will give him all the love he deserves.",

            "description": "Meet Tony! He arrived as a stray and was so afraid of all the new things at first. This gentle giant was lucky enough to land a fantastic foster home when the shelter closed in March. Tony's foster mom says that he is all love and no bark! He has the best smile and yes, cuddling is his specialty. Tony is low energy inside the home, but he loves to go on walks and explore! He enjoys sniffing everything... scent games are one of his favorite activities. Tony can have a bit of stranger danger when meeting new people. This means he needs slow, proper intros a few times before he feels safe with you. And that's okay! We don't know what Tony's life was like before we met him but he needs some time to be able to trust you. And once you are in with Tony, you are IN! Tony's ideal home would be low-traffic and adult only. He needs to be the only pet for now. Tony is house trained, quiet, and does well in apartment settings. He asked that we tell you that he loves to go on car rides, especially when one of the stops is for an ice-cream cone! Tony comes with the full support of the Orange Dot Crew (a volunteer advocacy group at Austin Animal Center) and will go home with a crate, all kinds of goodies and enrichment items, as well as a free training voucher.

(Can you tell\nhe\u2019s my favorite?)\n\nCats: Not too sure.\nDogs: He prefers to be the only dog.\nKids: Maybe some older kids would do!\n\n\nThis big ole\u2019 hunk is Ralphie! He came to us in January as a stray and was pretty aloof at first but that\u2019s hardly the case these days. He has become more comfortable with his new friends and surroundings here at the shelter. His curiosity is a sight to see! With every noise there is a mystery to be solved, and anything new he has to investigate. Ralphie\u2019s good natured personality is blooming and could really use someone to help him grow into the awesome dog he is becoming. Ralphie will be neutered, vaccinated and microchipped before he figures out who his family is going to be!",

He is considered an older adult at around 6 years old, but he refuses to accept that. Martin still has a ton of pep in his step like a teenager and loves his toys like a toddler. Martin would most likely benefit from a family that is home a lot, he has a tendency to feel pretty anxious when left alone. At times he can be pretty aloof to people, but with the right treats, toys and butt scratches, he will be your best bud. He came to us as a stray in February but can definitely thrive in a family setting possibly with another dog in the home. Martin is already neutered, up to date on vaccinations and will be microchipped before finding his way home!",

She is super playful, loves toys, running in the fenced in play yards, and long hikes with her volunteer friends. She is anxious with new sounds, sights and people.  She does have a history including guarding high value items so we are requiring her to go to a home with adults only. Due to some conflicted interactions with other dogs we are also suggesting a single dog home.. \n\nShe will require a multiple meetings to see her true personality and we would recommend the same type of slow, cautious introductions to any new people that she meets.  If you are interested in meeting this lovely lady please turn in an application and our behavior manager will contact you so that you can come out and meet her.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting any of our adoptable dogs, please fill out an application at https://www.mlar.org/adoption-overview\n\nE-mails regarding adoption are not considered an application. \n\nOut-of-state applicants (outside PA/NJ/DE) will not be considered, unless there are special circumstances. \n\nPlease visit our web site for more detailed information on the animals in our care, our educational campaigns, and for helpful tips on adoption.  www.MLAR.org",

            "description": "Hi my name is Haley. I weigh about 43 lb and am a Retriever/Boxer mix. I am full grown so I will not get any bigger. My approximate birthday is Feb 15, 2018. I am house trained. I walk well on a leash and enjoy going for walks. I would do best in a home with no other dogs and considerate children over 8 years old. I live in a home with other dogs now, but sometimes I get upset and don't want to have them around me anymore. I prefer to be in a home with lots of human love! Some good activities for me are walks, going out to eat at pet friendly establishments or other fun activities you enjoy doing. No apartments, please. I need a home with a fully fenced backyard. If you're interested in a loving companion and a good girl I could possibly be a good fit for your family.\n \nDo Not call to let us know you are interested. Follow the step stated below.\n\nAdopter for Haley must be at least 25 years old.  Adoption fee for Haley is $550.00.\n\nHaley is currently in Texas but will travel to the PNW once an adopter has been found.\n\n***The first step in the process if you are interested in being considered for Haley, is to email us information about yourself and your family. A brief introduction to your family will be helpful in determining if Haley will be a good fit for your family. Please include where you live, current/past vet, etc. Send your inquiry to rogarcia58@yahoo.com. Do not inquire through the Petfinder site. Those inquiries are not being received by the rescue organization.",

Due to his past, gaining his trust has been a project and requires some time and patience. He loves other dogs very much and finds that his trust grows around people-trusting dogs. He enjoys the outdoors and exploring, and can even be sassy when he doesn\u2019t get to run or adventure in the yard. Jack has such a gentle personality but still requires some work with leash and obedience.  He is very sweet, very food-motivated, and is goofy with other dogs. He is a socially awkward bundle of love.\n\nJack has all his necessary vaccinations, is microchipped, and is neutered. As of 2020, he is around 9 years old.\n",

He is an active dog who would do best with an active owner to keep him busy with walks, hiking, etc. He will whine when he doesn't have enough to do (Mom! I'm boooored!!). He is fully potty trained and will go in the kennel when asked but has also been trustworthy when left out. He likes to play with other dogs his size with proper introductions. Hershey is not a fan of felines, so we would recommend a home without cats as he is too tempted to chase them. Hershey is likely a great candidate for some organized dog training classes to keep that active mind challenged. Classes are a great opportunity for a dog and owner to learn together and practice at home. Hershey needs a 6-ft fenced yard as he does enjoy the outdoors and having the opportunity to sniff and run freely around the yard (no apartment living for this boy). Hershey is a Chocolate Lab/mix, weighs 62 lbs and was born approximately 12-14-15. He is neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, given flea/tick preventative, dewormed. Hershey had life-saving treatment for heartworm disease. He will need to remain on heartworm preventative for life, as is recommended for ALL dogs, and retested in 6 months to ensure he is heartworm free. Adoption fee is $250 to help offset the many expenses we have for vetting costs. We rely strictly on adoption fees and donations to continue to save the lives of orphaned & abandoned pets; 100% goes towards their care.",

            "description": "Meet Mina! Mina is a 6 year old blind pitty-type girl.\n\nMina came to us suffering from severe glaucoma. She has had necessary surgery to remove both eyes.\n\nDespite this, Mina is an incredibly happy, spunky girl, and a staff favorite. She is currently residing in a foster home post-surgery. Potential adopters should have blind dog experience, or be willing to give her a proper adjustment period. She is still learning to master stairs and is apprehensive in new environments, but adjusts fairly quickly. She should go into a home with either no kids, or with kids old enough to know not to startle her. She is doing ok with other canines in foster but can get overstimulated if not monitored, so would be better with a laid-back male canine sibling, or as a spoiled only child. She was non-reactive when tested with cats. She does have some occasional anxiety when left alone, but crates very nicely when necessary.\n\nFor more information or to request an adoption application, please stop into the shelter, or contact us via email.\n\nbollmanje@baycounty.net \n(989) 894-0679\n",

            "description": "Mako is a 12 year old male mixed breed. He weighs 96 pounds. Mako is a resource guarder which means that he can be possessive of both treats and toys with humans. He gives plenty of appropriate warnings to let you know that he isn't fond of sharing. Mako was transferred from a county facility so we do not have information about his previous household. Mako can be friendly with other dogs although he is very fond of humping and needs a dog friend or friends that can give him appropriate corrections when they've had enough. Dogs that are not fond of being humped or that are prone to overcorrections may not make good dog friends for Mako. We always recommend a meet and greet with any resident dogs. If you are unsure about your pup's feelings on this type of play, our staff can help by supervising a meet and greet and explaining the behaviors they observe. We do not know if the resource guarding issue with treats and toys extends to his dog friends as we have not introduced toys during any dog interactions. Mako has been on a slumber party during which he was rude to the residents cats and chased them throughout the house. At this time we don't believe Mako would do well living with cats. We have no information on how Mako behaves around children. However, due to Mako's resource guarding we would recommend him only with older children that are able to read and respect his communication about sharing (or rather not sharing) his toys and treats. We always recommend a meet and greet with any children in the household or children that visit often, such as grandkids. Please call for more information or to make an appointment to meet Mako.

A very nice older lady took me in and fostered me until the kind hearted Lucie's folks could fit me in.\n\nReady to go??  I am full energy and ready to run and play!!!  I just love kids because they tend run and play like me!  Oh yeah, I'm treat motivated :) :) :)\n\nI love playing with toys but haven't quite mastered the whole retrieving thing  ;)\n\nI would be an awesome family dog or one for an active adult who enjoys running or hiking.\n\nAt the moment, I am enjoying rough play with my kennelmates, so if you have another dog who enjoys that as well, that would be really swell.  I'm ok by myself too.\n\nI am leash and crate trained.\n\nHope to see you soon!\n\n\n*** We strive to ensure our dogs are going to a safe, loving and caring home. Phone interviews are required for all adoptions****",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Whiskey is an angel. He is great with other dogs, wonderful with children. Not so great with cats but he also doesn't chase. He will sit along the fence and watch the activity of the wild life as the deer and other animals come by to graze, but he doesn't get excited and he doesn't chase.\n\nWhiskey is a little shy at first but quickly warms up. He is very polite.\n\nWhiskey is learning commands and knows sit, lay and shake. To see him is to love him and every one that does falls in love. Wouldn;t you love to have this cuddle bug in your life?\n\nPlease contact\napp@aarfhouston.org\nfor more information about this dog.\n\nYou can apply online by clicking on\n\nApplication\n\n. Once your application is approved, we will schedule a meet and greet at one of our adoption events.\n\nThank you for considering a rescue!\n\nThe adoption fee includes vaccinations, Bordetella, de-worming, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip. There is a an additional $12.99 fee for Home Again for a lifetime registration of the microchip.\nPuppies cannot be adopted outside of the Houston area until they are spay/neutered after they are 4 months old. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.\nNOTE: In our bios, we provide information based on our volunteer's experience with a particular dog; such as temperament, training, and ability to get along with others.\nAARF is a 501(c)3 Non Profit, all breed, no kill organization. Our group is always in need of donations in order to continue to give the needed medical care to our rescues. Adoption fees do not begin to cover all of the medical costs. Any donation , no matter how small is a big help and is greatly appreciated. Please help us to continue to help them. Thank you.",

He is a lab-mix with a lovely black coat and white markings. Ripley is a medium-sized dog, who is 3 years old. \n\nRipley came to Mostly Muttz Rescue as a stray so he will require patience and consistency to help him build confidence to flourish. He is currently receiving a lot of love and structure in his foster home. He is such a sweetie! \n\nRipley will need a home with adults only due to his reserved disposition. He likes other dogs, but no cats for this boy.\n\nIf you have a place in your heart and your home for Ripley, please visit www.mostlymuttz.org/adoption-application/ to complete an application.",

Rylie is a small 3yo female German Shepherd mix who is being surrendered by her family in Memphis. Sweet, friendly, well-socialized, affectionate. Loves other dogs and is very active and playful with other dogs. Not cat tested. Loves kids and is very gentle with the family's 1 year old daughter.  Crate trained and housebroken. Very active outside, settles down in the house. Not obedience trained and does not know hand signal commands, but  Rylie is very smart and would learn quickly.  Loves to be with her people.  Good on a leash, rides great in the car.  Estimated DOB April 2017. Healthy and fully vetted, current on shots, spayed, weighs about 40 pounds.  AWESOME young GSD mix will make a wonderful companion (and jogging partner!) for an active family who has experience with hearing deficit dogs.\n\nHere's a note from  Rylie's 'dad:'  We rescued  Rylie from a construction site when she was just a puppy and she is a beloved family pet. She's a sweet dog, very playful and does well with other animals. The reason we're looking to re-home her is because my wife and I have a 1 year old and, because  Rylie is very active, we're afraid that she might get too excited and accidentally bump into our daughter and hurt her without realizing it and because she's deaf we don\u2019t want her to go to just anyone. We want to her to go to a home where she will be loved and treated right because she is a very sweet girl.\n\nTo adopt please fill out an adoption  http://www.happydogrescue.org/Application595.html \n\nContact us at reply@happydogrescue.org\n\nVisit us at  http://www.happydogrescue.org",

He possesses just the right amount of chilled-out, yet still enjoys a beagle adventure and will follow his nose as any self-respecting hound would. McGriddle strikes the perfect balance of  couch potato cuddler and walking buddy.\n\nMcGriddle is current on vaccinations, neutered, and microchipped. He is current on heartworm preventative and has tested negative for heartworms.\n\n*Local adoptions (New Orleans and surrounding parishes) preferred. We do NOT ship animals\n\nIf you are interested, please fill out a Dog Adoption Application at www.petadoptionservices.org/forms\n\nOur adoptions include a foster period of 4-6 weeks so that you can be sure that this pet is a good fit without any pressure, and we are available to answer any behavior or training questions during that time (and beyond, if you wish).",

            "description": "Intake date 5 November 2019 . 2 year old neutered male border collie (mix?). Meet Bart! ? Bart is a border collie (mix?) who came to us from a shelter partner where he had been picked up stray. ? Bart would love a fun job, and lots of games and play, as well as a fun pack mate or two. ? Bart is bright, eager, and willing. He can be silly and playful, enjoys playing with other dogs, and is a real pleasure to be around - and he is super handsome ? ? Bart will do best in an active home that understands that rules and parameters are part of the game. Bart would love to become someone's walking or hiking partner - he is very athletic and would enjoy becoming a training partner for games such as agility. ? Bart is crate trained, and is housebroken in his foster home. Bart enjoys training, and would enjoy a playful, confident dog partner, as well as a human partner ready to bend his brain. ? Bart's history with children and cats is unknown. He is located in Maryland. ? For information on adoption, please visit our website at mabcr.org. Please be sure to read our FAQs prior to application. #mabcr #rightdogrighthome #MABCRBart @ MABCR . Picked up stray, we pulled him when no one claimed him. Bart can be super bouncy and silly when excited -- he walks perfectly on leash until he is excited, then all bets are off! So far, Bart is great with other dogs (although he has a rougher play style than your typical border collie), and has been excellent with people. Bart will do best in a home that enjoyed training and exercise, and doing fun things with their dog. Bart is crate trained, appears to understand housebreaking, and will need work on leash walking. For information on adoption, our FAQ, and our application, please see our website at mabcr.org.\n.\nPLEASE READ our procedures for adoption prior to making inquiry regarding this dog. If you are looking for additional photos, video, or information on this dog, you will likely find that by searching our facebook page for their photo/description album.\n.\nPlease see our main website at www.mabcr.org for more information regarding the adoption of this or any dog from our rescue. \n.\nPlease note that while this dog is currently available, any dog on our site may have an adoption pending and may not be available to you at this time. The same dog may later become available if the adoption falls through. \n.\nOur website www.mabcr.org will give you details on our adoption procedures as well as an application for adoption. An application must be submitted prior to 'matching' an adopter with a dog as all dogs do not fit into all homes. We pride ourselves in our adoption process, we take the time to get to know our adopters so that we can place a dog with them that they can enjoy for years to come.\n.\nPlease understand that we will not discuss dogs with individual adopters until after the application process is completed.\n.\nOur rescue does not have a public facility, therefore there are no visiting hours. Appointments to visit with the available dogs are made after the application process has been completed by our staff.  \n.\nTo assist any dog within the MABCR organization, please consider making a donation to the general fund or to the medical fund. All dogs coming into our rescue are fully vetted (s/n and core vaccines) prior to adoption.\n.\nRescuing animals is quite expensive. If you are unable to adopt, but would like to help this, or any other animal in our system, please consider a sponsorship donation. \nFor information on our sponsorship program, please contact Sarah at SLR@mabcr.org. \n.\nThank you for your interest in Mid-Atlantic Border Collie Rescue.",

This poor boy was living out there for a very long time and was in horrific condition. Joey had been hit by a car (not sure how long ago) and his pelvis now twisted resulted in his back-left leg to dangle. He also had multiple skin and eye infections, he was also heartworm positive not neutered and was skin and bones.\n\nJoey has come such a long way, he has been neutered, had entropion surgery and was on medication for ear and skin infections and has been through heartworm treatment. The vet looked at Joey's leg and pelvis and unfortunately there was so much arthritis that surgery would not help him. Joey is now taking Cosequin to help ease his discomfort. Joey is estimated to be 7 years old.\n\nJoey is house and crate trained, he does well with other dogs and is a happy boy! Joey is a toy terminator as he loves to destuff toys! He also enjoys chewing on bones too! Joey loves to be outside in nice weather or run around the yard with a toy in his mouth. One of his favorite things to do is to get a belly rub! Joey also likes to snuggle on the couch, he loves to be loved on! Joey is looking for a family that will adore him like his foster Mom does and will love him through his senior years. Joey weighs 45 lbs.\n\nMessage or Email: forgottenpetadvocates@yahoo.com to meet this Gorgeous boy!\n\nJoey's Photo Album:https://www.facebook.com/pg/theforgottenpetadvocates/photos/?tab=album&album_id=3406763249339259",

When rescued by his previous owner he had a BB pellet under the skin on his back, it's still there, but being shot at is probably the reason he is leery of some people. He is the perfect lap dog once he settles in.  He was living with a 1 year old pit mix and loved her! He definitely prefers the larger dogs but gets along with small dogs that he chooses. Older children only. He is crate trained and very food motivated. Chief would LOVE a calm quiet house, although his foster home is crazy and he does pretty well there! Chief is heartworm positive and is on treatment but it doesn't stop him from being a pretty awesome!\n\nIncluded with adoption: Age-appropriate vaccinations, up to date heart-worm preventative, heart-worm test if over 6 months, insurance for 30 days, microchip with registration, and spayed or neutered- if not already, a voucher is provided. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete our Pre-application: https://form.jotform.us/asr628/ShortAdoptionInquiry",

He has a wobbly gait, sometimes crawls, lies flat to urinate sometimes but defecates normally. He is UTD on vaccines, HW negative, neutered, wormed.He is also microchipped\n\nChester is as sweet as pie. He is housebroken, rarely barks unless he needs to go out but has recently shown some separation anxiety if the foster family leaves the room. He is great with other dogs. He doesn't bother anything and loves to be petted and likes to curl up on a blanket or the couch.He has a good appetite . He just wants someone to love him for the rest of his life.\n\n5/5/20: Check out Chester's new picture. He may be a senior but he is a little goof ball. His foster found him curled up asleep like this. He is just waiting for someone to give him a loving home. He would be great for a senior person\n\nChester is being fostered in Tennessee. His adoption fee is $200.00. For more information, contact settertown@aol.com. This dog will not be transported long distances.",

            "description": "Tara is a beautiful sweet girl, 6 year old, 60 pound Labrador Mix. Tara has come from a timid girl to begging for belly pets and ear scratches. Having been kenneled when young, she is slow to warm up with new people, but is playful and loving with patience. Young children with sudden movement and loud sounds can still startle her, but once she is used to someone, she wants to please. Recommended to NOT have small animals or cats around her. She has been friends with a few dogs in her past, yet she is also territorial \u2026 so maybe a calm male dog for a companion (advance visit recommended).\n \nShe needs a yard for toy chasing and a 6 foot privacy fence required as she can jump something shorter. She appears to be housebroken, mostly from being let out in the yard and neighborhood walks 2-3 times per day, but she does not know how to ask to go out, so walks are a must. She is good on a leash as long as loud noises don\u2019t scare her. \n \nShe is very smart and naturally trainable when you show approval or disapproval, even without using treats. She has reached at least beginner level of: sit, lie down, hold (wait before going through the door of home and car), up (sofa or car), okay! (come through the door or out of the car), this way (when her nose wants to lead her astray on a walk), and \u201cTara, come\u201d has her show up with her calm, slow walk.\n \nShe LOVES her squeaky toys and will chase them when thrown in the yard, where she will toss it and tear it up. \n\n\nFor adoption: www.spcaeasttx.com\nFor more information: adopt@spcaeasttx.com",

There were 70+ dogs on the property in horrific conditions. Shrek was living in a crate, had not been neutered, was a little thin, and infested with fleas. We had a foster step up and we were able to take him into our program on 2/6/2020. Linkin has no teeth and was treated for a double ear infection and skin infection from a severe flea dermatitis. It's hard to imagine what he has endured, but it's only uphill from here!\n\nABOUT LINKIN\n\nLinkin is really enjoying that fostered life, outside the confinements of just a crate. Linkin is house trained and crate trained. He is good with other dogs and even his picky, canine foster-sister loves him! Due to his past neglect and lack of food, Linkin does not share food with other dogs and needs to be fed separately so he just eats his meals in his crate. He does well with kids, but is not suited for a home with cats. He is a low energy, lounge around, Netflix-and-Chill kinda guy. He always wants to be with his people and is a true velcro-dog as he will follow you from room to room. Next to his people, his favorite thing is food - any and all of the food! He already knows the commands sit, shake, and wait. Linkin is a sweet, affectionate boy who biggest joys are napping, car rides, snacks, and cuddling.\n\nLinkin loves his people and is very loyal so he would really love someone who is home a lot. He sleeps most of the day, but follows his foster mom around the house, never letting her out of his sight. He can go on short walks, but doesn't enjoy being outside for long periods of time. He is looking for a forever family to lounge around with that will give him all the belly rubs and attention he lacked for so long. His past life has somehow left him with chronic Emphysema/COPD so his lungs have a lot of scar tissue from a previous unknown trauma. The cough he's had since we rescued him has gotten significantly better, but it's still lingering. Our vet seems to think Linkin may have some kind of immune deficiency due to his skin flare ups and chronic respiratory issues, but we are working on finding what works for him.\n\nPhoto Album of Linkin: https://www.facebook.com/pg/FriendsToTheForlornPitbullRescue/photos/?tab=album&album_id=2984198311638315\n\nFollow Linkin on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/whatapitty4them/\n\nOur adoption fee is $300. All dogs are current on vaccinations, spayed or neutered, micro-chipped, on heartworm prevention, and are fed top of the line grain-free food.www.savingpitbulls.org",

She is 48 lb and stands 18 inches. Cheyenne is very loving and sweet, but unfortunately hasn't had much training. She has been kept outside only and hasn't had house training. She is quite strong and active, so might do best in a home without very young children as she tends to jump. She has not shown aggression, but would do best in a home without cats or smaller dogs. She has done all right with dogs her size or larger.  She would do best with adopters who have experience with active dogs who need some attention and patient but firm training. She has a lot of love to give and would really treasure a new forever home, with active adopters who will give her some exercise and playtime. If you would cherish Cheyenne as your new canine companion and family member, please apply at yvpr.org/adoptions.\n\n\nAn application must be filled out and accepted before a meet can be set up. If accepted, you will hear from us within 72 hours. You will have the opportunity to ask questions before you meet the pet; an adoption may or may not happen at that time. We do adopt outside the Yakima area IF you are able to come to Yakima to pick up your adopted pet.  We do not have a kennel facility; all of our pets are in foster homes. Therefore, meets and adoptions take place at either our office or at a place chosen by the foster.   If a pet has 'pending' beside its name, an adoption is imminent. Please fill out an application anyway because adoptions don't always go through. Your application will be kept on file for 30 days in case you find another pet you'd like to apply for.  Thanks for thinking adoption and Good Luck!",

            "description": "Originally from Mississippi, it was evident by her reactions to people and situations, she had experienced trauma and lived a life of uncertainty. Her wait for the right forever home has been long, due to her very specific needs. \n\nMolly's needs are a lifelong commitment and will need constant management. She struggles with fear aggression towards new people. Her introductions are done at a very slow pace, with her comfort level as priority. She must meet any interested adopter several times before any interactions due to her fear. You will not see her true personality at first meet but she is worth every bit of extra time and patience. Once that breakthrough showing trust and confidence happens, you will see she is a wonderful, loyal dog who will accept you. \n\nMolly is a 5 year old hound mix, weighs 58 lbs., is spayed, current on vaccinations and completely housebroken. She enjoys walking, playing and quiet car rides. Molly gets along great with most dogs and would enjoy having a compatible dog sibling to help build her confidence. She is very intelligent, a champ at commands and very eager to please. Molly is very food motivated and is an expert at nose work, quickly searching out any hidden treats. She sits patiently in her \"place\" and awaits the \"ok\" command to find the goods! Without having to be prompted, she will sit, lie down or give her paw for rewards and positive words of praise. \n\nShe requires a quiet, calm ADULT ONLY home (preferably with only one to two people). Molly is not suited for large gatherings of people. No children and no cats. \n\nA quiet home in a rural area is best. She is not suited for city/suburb living or for any apartment/condo complex living. \n\nWe know her needs are very specific. She deserves to succeed in life and be a happy pup. We are committed to finding her the home and person she is meant to be with.\n\nWe kindly ask, IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS regarding Molly, PLEASE EMAIL:\n\n adoption@popememorialcvhs.org\n\n******************************************\n\nAHow To Adopt a Pet\n\nWe are currently offering adoptions by appointment only, due to the Coronavirus. The Adoption Center remains closed to drop-in visitors.\n\nThe process to schedule an appointment begins with the submission of an application, which can be found on our website. Once the application is approved, we will reach out to you to schedule an appointment. Please bear with us, the new process has slowed our response time.\n\nIf you do not see an animal that would fit into your home, we highly recommend checking our website weekly as new animals may become available. We do not offer a waitlist for specific breeds, types, etc. \n\nAs always, adoptions are first come, first serve, meaning the applicant who is approved first gets their choice of available appointment times and thus his/her choice of animals to meet and adopt. We are not able to extend holds on any animals at this time, so we ask interested adopters to make their adoption decision during their appointment and be prepared to take their new pet home with you.\n\nThe easiest way to communicate with us with any questions is via email to: \n\nadoption@popememorialcvhs.org\n\n\nNo phone calls please - Submit an application here ----> \n\nhttps://popememorialcvhs.org/adoption-application\n Primary Color: White Secondary Color: Tan Weight: 62.5lbs Age: 5yrs 1mths 3wks Animal has been Spayed",

This handsome shepherd mix is in his prime and quite healthy. He is blind but you wouldn't know it by watching him maneuver around the house and yard. Finn is affectionate, playful and gets along well with just about everyone, including fellow canines. He's also housebroken and crate trained. Finn was surrendered in February by an owner who didn't have time to care for him. He has been waiting a very long time for a forever home. He would be perfect for an individual or family who already has a dog who needs a friend.\n\nHe learned the layout of his foster home very quickly. He will stand by the door and bark when he needs to go outside. A home with a fenced-in yard is best because he is still working on walking on a leash and responding to basic commands. He likes to gnaw, so he needs to be kept well supplied in toys and chews. Finn needs company during the day, so someone who works from home, whether single or part of a family, would be ideal. Available at Tired Dog Rescue in Gulfport, MS. Visit the website to complete an application, www.tireddogrescue.com Fee: Paid by a TDR angel.",

            "description": "Honey Bun was trapped with safe trap. She had been hanging around a property for 4 days when rescue was contacted. She was terrified. Not very social, never been in a house. Terrified of leash.\n\nUpdate:\nWill need time and patience. Now crate trained and coming in house when asked. Still scared. Must have 6' physical fence. \n\nFew weeks later doing much better. Comes in when asked, is crate trained. She is still terrified of leash. Not sure about being petted, will continue to work with her. \n\nAll of the adults in our program are fully vaccinated, spay/neutered, and have been microchipped.  The adoption fee is $175. Adoptions are limited to within a 100 mile radius of Cincinnati.  Applications can be submitted online at:  https://form.jotform.com/FredsMission/app",

If you are outside of this area please do a search for your local GSP/GWP/Pointer rescue group.\n\n--------\n\nI'm MAYLAN!  I'm a gorgeous GSP girl with lots of energy and a happy nature.  I love everyone and everything (except cats).  I'm very, very smart and acclimate quickly with the right people who know my breed.\n\nMy approx. DOB is 1/21/2016.  In at tall girl at 24\" at my withers and weigh 45 lbs.  I'm lanky because of my activity level.  I'm loving my new life and ability to interact with lots of people and other dogs.\n\nMy foster mom just loves me.  I go hiking in the mountains with her and am great relaxing at home.  She thinks I'm the Best Dog Ever!\n\n--------\n\nGENERAL APPLICATION NOTES:\n\nWe strongly urge adopters to consider a male canine companion if they already have a female GSP/GWP. We get asked several times a year to take in one member of a 2-female GSP family because there are control issues between their girls that result in pretty ferocious fights. Interestingly that never happens among males. Go figure.\n\nDogs under 2 years of age need to go to a home with another well-socialized canine companion of a similar size (when grown) and within a few years of the pup\u2019s age. This is how they maintain and continue their learning/socialization process. Socialization outside the home is important but doesn\u2019t replace the in-home learning that is so important as the pup ages. https://www.facebook.com/ UtahsPerfectPointers/posts/ 1460968517254816\n\nMost older dogs aren\u2019t interested in having a puppy incessantly chewing on it and demanding attention. If you live outside of the Salt Lake area and are sure that your older dog just loves puppies, please arrange a visit at your home with a 2-4 month old pup for a couple of hours and make sure that your older dog feels the same way about this that you do. Please video the interactions and send it to us.\n\nJust a word of caution........ most pointer types need jobs. Otherwise they're not good pets. They need to be able to utilize their brains and no amount of exercise without a \"work\" or \"thinking\" component is adequate. The job doesn't need to be hunting. But it does need to be something that satisfies their genetic predispositions - nose work, agility, tracking, dock diving, etc. The job cannot just be obedience. If they can't use their innate senses they're just never going to be the dog you want for the next 15 years.\n\nA physical fence is required for most of our dogs.\n\nAs far as other breeds go, the pointers are generally good with most other breeds with the exception of the Arctic breeds and bulldogs. I'm not sure why, but if there's ever an altercation in daycare between a UPP dog and another dog, it's generally one of those two breeds. It may be the difference in energy levels. It may be some ancient behavior we know nothing about...... Not sure.\n\nUtah's Perfect Pointers is a very small rescue group and doesn't have the resources to adopt to states except for the ones noted above. If you are interested in adopting a GSP please contact the closest groups below.

            "description": "Diana is looking for her forever home.  She's house trained, great in the crate, and very social with people.\n\nSnuggle partner #1 -  she definitely enjoys cuddling and napping with her people  or on comfy a dog bed.\n\nShe likes to party and play loud and fast with her dog friends. So she's not every dog's cup of dog tea. She doesn't  like hanging with anxious, fearful or reactive dogs.   ? \n\nShe is very sweet and loyal.  There is never a dull moment with her bouncy energy in her training pack.  She loves to interact with new dogs and new people.  She is high energy and likes to play so needs playmates to fit her energy.   She loves trips to the pet store and doesn\u2019t mind getting baths either!! Such a sweet girl!  If you would like to adopt Diana and you live in the Buffalo area please go to hamburgmutts.org and submit an application!\n\n\nReady to make a commitment? We have wonderful dogs that would love to be a part of your family! All dogs are spayed/neutered before adoption, or scheduled to be altered during the first week of arrival from the shelter. They are up-to-date on vaccinations and a certificate for a FREE initial vet visit is provided to the adopter.\n\nAdoption Fees\n\nPuppies \u2013 $450 \u2013 Hamburg Mutt\u2019s pays for spay/neuter when puppy reaches appropriate age. Adopters will be refunded $50 if they take their puppy for obedience training within 60 days of adoption. \n\nPuppy Mill Dogs \u2013 $400\n\nAll Other Dogs \u2013 $350\n\n\nAdoption Location\n\nPlease note that we only adopt out dogs to owners in the United States and within 50 miles of Buffalo, NY. We do this to ensure that our volunteers do not have to travel far when they conduct home visits and take dogs for meet and greets. Keeping adopted dogs local also enables us to provide assistance to new owners as needed. If you do not live the Buffalo area we would be happy to help you find a rescue that is close to where you are!",

            "description": "Zirkel is a 1 year old female Bernese Mountain Dog rescued as a puppy from a puppy mill on 02/22/20 with what they thought was a heart murmur.\n\nShe is available for adoption but will need a home who accepts her medical condition and will follow up with her future medical care as instructed.\n\nWe had our veterinarian evaluate her and then she was referred to The Ohio State University Veterinary Medical Center\n\n03/11/20 The Ohio State University Veterinary Medical Center Cardiology Department diagnosed our little girl with a Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD). While these can sometimes be repaired and some cause no serious problems, her problem is complicated by some other abnormalities (thanks to puppy mills and inbreeding). \nWhile we don\u2019t have a long term prognosis, it is possible that she will live a somewhat normal and healthy life for the next 5-6 years, but she will need to have a follow-up echo done every 6 months to assess how she is growing. \n\nWe decided to keep her on medical hold for 6 months until the next echocardiogram.\n\n09/14/20 check up from The Ohio State University Veterinary Medical Center\nZirkel has a complex combination of congenital heart defects that makes assessment for long term prognosis difficult. Her long term prognosis is guarded overall. Luckily, she is not symptomatic for any of her cardiac disease at this time and appears to be on overall decent health. Zirkel had slight enlargement of two chambers of her heart (right atrium, left ventricle), but there is no reason to put Zirkel on any medications for her heart disease at this time. Zirkel will require life long monitoring of her heart with echocardiograms. Her next echocardiogram is due 03/14/2021\n\nDespite her heart problems Zirkel is a fun loving girl! She is doing well in her foster home and gets along with the other dogs in the home.\n\nIf you think you would be interested, please complete our no obligation application and we can start the process at www.luv4k9s.org. Select Available Dogs then scroll down to application, complete and submit. \n\nA physical secure fence attached to the residence is a requirement to adopt a dog from our rescue. Invisible fence doesn't meet this requirement. No exceptions.\n\nOur adoption area is primarily OHIO. We will consider KENTUCKY, AND INDIANA AND CERTAIN AREAS OF MICHIGAN, WEST VIRGINIA, AND PENNSYLVANIA. \n\nWE DO NOT SHIP NOR ARRANGE TRANSPORTS.\n\nTHE APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED AND SUBMITTED BEFORE WE CAN START THE PROCESS. \n\nIT CAN TAKE AT LEAST 2 WEEKS TO PROCESS AN APPLICATION SOMETIMES LONGER DEPENDING ON VOLUNTEER AVAILABILITY AND NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS RECEIVED SO PLEASE BE PATIENT. \n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters must understand that each home is different, and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. \nHomes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for:\n1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (ex. a 4 month old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break) \n2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old, to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise.\n3.) Socialization: The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home.\n4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded tenfold, for years to come.\nPlease do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy. Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time consuming and can be expensive. All Dogs Require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well-trained, well socialized dog is more than worth the effort put in to get them there. \n\nOur adoption fee includes spay/neuter, routine shots, rabies, worming, microchipped, heartworm testing and they are on monthly preventative. Visit our website www.luv4k9s.org for more information and to complete an application.\n",

This chocolate love muffin is a show stopper.  He weighs in at 145 lbs, and will likely grow larger.  Don\u2019t let his size fool you, he is actually a very timid guy and needs some special care.  Ajax comes with continued training support to help him continue on his journey.  He is very \"dog selective\" and does better with women on first dates (and maybe 3rd and 5th dates).  He will be brought up-to-date on vaccines and micro-chipped before an adoption is finalized.  Ajax is very smart and loves playing games.  If you are interested in meeting him, please call.  We expect it will take several dates before he is ready to be adopted.  \n\nMust have home inspection, etc.   Yes, there is a re-homing fee and adoption contract.",

You see he needed some medical attention to his eyes and surgery to correct the issue. He is ALL healed and such a good boy!! He walks great on a leash, likes most other dogs (will need a meet and greet with fursiblings), LOVES humans, house broke and crate trained, cats are unknown at this time. As a Lab/Shepherd mix, estimated 5-6 years and weighing in at 60lbs he would be the perfect snuggle buddy for a cold day!! Who wouldn\u2019t want to come home to this teddy bear??",

            "description": "Charity found her way to Maricopa Animal Care and Control as a stray.\n\nCharity is a 9 year old labrador retriever/ Pitbull Terrier mix weighing 55 pounds. She is a pretty darn near perfect dog! She has the sweetest personality and gives great hugs and kisses.\n\nCharity is great with all adults and children, but because of her size, children over 5 years are best. She likes to be with you and is happy to keep you warm while cuddling on the couch watching TV. She sleeps quietly in her bed through the night.\n\nFor an older dog, Charity has lots of energy! She loves taking walks and does great on the leash. She also loves car rides to anywhere! She is a great companion to run errands or take on road trips. You will find her with her head daintily at the car window sniffing everything that passes by\u2014always with a smile on her face. Charity is a happy dog with a tail that doesn\u2019t stop wagging.\n\nCharity also loves her time in the yard playing with her favorite blue shark toy or chasing the pole wand around until she is out of breath. Then she settles back inside on the couch for a nap.\n\nCharity gets along with the cat in her foster home although she does get jealous when she doesn\u2019t get all the attention! She is picky about her canine companions so she must be the only dog in the home.\n\nCharity is housetrained and knows the commands of sit, shake and stay. She\u2019s pretty great at catching treats too.\n\nThe ideal home for this pretty girl would be a family that is familiar with big dogs. Someone that has a yard to exercise and play. A family that is able to walk and/ or play with her several times a day. And most of all, someone that can look into those big, brown eyes and say, \u201c I\u2019ll love you forever\u201d\u2026..and Charity will love you forever right back.\n\nDo you have room in your heart and home for Charity?\n",

            "description": "Breed: Cattle Dog mix\nSex: Neutered Male\nDOB: ~10/22/2017\nWeight: 45 lbs\nEnergy Level: Medium\nPersonality Type: Wallflower, Extremely Smart, Food-Motivated, Introverted, Timid, Needs A Job\nHistory: Transferred from another shelter\nIdeal Home: Fenced in yard (privacy fence preferred), no kids, no other pets. Calm home without a lot of traffic or loud neighbors. No apartments.\nSpecial Info: LOVES training, knows lots of commands! Loves puzzle feeder toys. Great walking/running partner! Housebroken! Please note, Beau's adopter will receive one FREE session with our trainer, included in his adoption fee.\n\nThe information we are providing for this animal was developed based on observations and assessments in a shelter or foster environment. We do our best to provide information that will help determine if the dog might be a good fit for you. Please note that behaviors may change in a home environment. We also ask our applicants to assume that any animal they adopt from us will need to be potty trained and learn house manners, although this is not always the case. Our online animal bios are designed to provide as much information as possible and answer some anticipated questions. We do not have the resources to respond to emails with more specific questions.\n\nWe are receiving an unusually high number of applications per pet at this time! Please follow the rules below to ensure your application is reviewed; pay attention closely to these instructions because applications will NOT be processed if they are not followed. Please keep in mind that dog/cat availability is currently changing by the hour; you will receive an email if the animal you are interested in is no longer available. New dogs become available almost every day, so feel free to let us know if someone else interests you if your initial choice is already adopted! \n\nFill out the application (DOG: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IHD-DOG-Application-9-10-18.pdf, CAT: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IHD-CAT-Application.pdf) completely. Every question must be answered, and it must be signed. If you are going to type your responses, open the application, save it, type your answers, and save it again. \n\n-Applicants must be 21+ years old and live within a 50-mile radius of our shelter at 22415 Groesbeck Hwy, Warren 48089.\n\n-You must identify at least 1 dog/cat that you are interested in. If there are multiple dogs/cats, number them in order of priority. \n\n-Scan a copy of proof of home ownership (i.e. tax bill, deed, or mortgage payment - you can black out the account #, etc.) or animal clause/agreement of your rental agreement.\n\n-Attach the application and home ownership proof/rental agreement animal clause to a new email and send it to bark@iheartdogs.org. The subject line must be formatted to read \"\"#1 choice of dog/cat, Your First and Last Name\"\". Example: Subject: Fido, Jane Doe\nOnce your application is received, it will be assigned to an Adoption Counselor who will follow-up with the applicant who is the best fit within a few days, or to discuss other dogs/cats. It could take up to a couple of weeks for you to receive a final disposition on your application so there is no need to check on the status.\n\n-Introductions will be scheduled by appointment only, 45 minutes per appointment. The entire household, including current dogs, must be present for the appointment. The introductions will take place outside in our parking lot.\n\n-We will continue to perform vet checks for current and prior pets in the household.\n\n-Home visits will be in person for the yard and virtual for inside the home.\n\n-Finalizing the adoption will also be scheduled by appointment.\n\nWhile this process may seem cumbersome, it is interim during COVID-19, and it is designed to help us respond to the volume of emails we receive every day. Since we are receiving a high volume of applications, please be patient if a dog/cat is no longer available. \n\nThank you for your understanding.",

She has come through a very long journey since she arrived in our care.\n \nAt 8 weeks old, Bella was hit by a car and surrendered to our rescue. What followed has been 10 months of hard work and dedication by her foster parents, caregivers and volunteers. Bella has had extensive medical and rehabilitation at Blue Pearl. She had an MRI and, most recently, full body X-rays to ensure nothing is hindering her from reaching her goal to be 100% mobile on her own.\n \nFortunately, Bella has never met a person she didn\u2019t love. She is incredibly friendly and loving. Bella loves to greet visitors at her foster home and at the park or on walks. She also loves other dogs she meets, so a home with other male dogs or no other dogs would suit her well. Bella also loves car rides.\n \nBella is at the point where she can stand on all four legs and is upright on all four legs for walking for short periods (as seen in the videos). She will need a dedicated home to continue with her down this path. Bella will provide her new home with tons of love and kisses and devotion. It is the right time to find that perfect home for her.\n\nIf you would like to adopt Bella, please visit our website and apply today!\n\nhttps://www.washingtongsd.org/adopt\n\nAre you following us on Facebook?  Our most recent updates, rescue animals and volunteer opportunities are posted to our Facebook page:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/WashingtonGermanShepherdRescue",

She is potty trained, crate trained and uses a dog door. She loves to give her people wet sloppy kisses. She is still a puppy so has some things to learn still but is very smart and picks things up easily. She has a super deep bark sure to scare any unwanted visitors away ?. She does well with most dogs, but does love to play and sometimes ignores signals to give them space although she is learning. Currently, she would do best with an active family with no small children as she is still learning not to jump and to respect personal space. *Must have a 6 foot fence and no apartments* Applications can be accessed at www.mikeyschance.com\n\nAll large and/or active dogs will require a full fenced (6ft) secure yard. \nNo children under 5. \n\nLike all Mikey's Chance dogs, this dog will come to you from a foster home that has provided loving one-on-one attention, socialization and some basic training, as well as quality food and exercise. \n\nApplications can be found at www.mikeyschance.com and completed on a computer, tablet, and/or phone.

Now his hair has grown back, his lungs are clear of pneumonia, and he is loving life. Oscar is fostered with 2 other dogs, one great dane and one 40 lb lab mix. He gets along good with both. His ideal home can have large dogs or he would do ok as an only dog too. Oscar loves his person and is very much a velcro gsd. No cats, no kids. Housetrained, walks good on a leash, loves his ball, he is a great boy !To apply for adoption, go to www.caninepetrescue.com and fill out our online adoption application.

She is currently undergoing heartworm treatment and does have some heart insufficiencies that MAY hopefully improve after treatment. Brigit also has bradycardia but does not need medication at this time. She is blind and will need an eye pressure check every 6 months due to cataracts to make sure glaucoma isn't developing. Bridget is not completely deaf but she is hard of hearing.\n\nSince she has already begun heartworm treatment she can not be adopted at this time, but can be pre-adopted though. She will stay with her foster until we can redo her echocardiogram and xrays 1 month after treatment.\n\nAll that being said; she is a happy girl who loves to be cuddled and gets along with all of the dogs at her foster home!\n\nFor inquiries, email inquiry@angelsrescue.org\n\nAn Adoption Application for this dog can be found and submitted online at http://www.angelsrescue.org/adopt/adoption-forms\n\nPlease be sure to like our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/angelsrescue.\n\n*Some of our animals receive a high volume of applications, and we strive to select the best home for each animal. However, we have many wonderful homeless pets available.",

            "description": "Good things can come out of something even as horrible as the coronavirus. Just ask any of our lucky shelter dogs who are being temporarily fostered in the homes of our huge-hearted volunteers. Miss Arabella, for one, is keeping busy and loving life. Here's what her foster mom has to say: \n\n\"She is one smart cookie!!  Fully housebroken and so far not any signs of destructiveness.  When we walk, she is alert to everything that moves (lizards, squirrels) and likes to bird watch. Very strong on leash, but listens when told to go easy. She sits (with wiggles) while I harness her and can give paw if asked. Jumps in your lap and lavishes you with kisses.  Loves her Kong toy and a nylabone.  Also likes to pick up sticks in the yard and bite them into pieces.  She needs exercise as she is very high energy. Would do well with a large fenced yard to play in.\"\n\nThis sweet girl originally came to our shelter after being passed around from home to home. Arabella weighs around 50 pounds, with an estimated birthdate of Nov. 2017. She loves attention and is an indiscriminate kisser ... even the vet gets kisses!\n\nArabella can jump a 4-foot fence and will bolt through an open door in pursuit of a squirrel/chipmunk/anything that moves, so her home-to-be will need to be diligent. We are currently only accepting applicants with securely fenced yards (sorry, no invisible fences) for Miss Arabella. She will be her best and happiest self as an only-child with an experienced dog family. Please visit www.STAF.org for visiting hours, a downloadable application, and additional information.\n\n\u2022  All of our animals are spayed/neutered and current on shots.\n\u2022  We do not do same-day adoptions; we ask that you return for a follow-up visit before taking an animal home.\n\u2022  You must be 21 years or older to adopt from STAF.\n\u2022  We require a 4-foot-tall physical fence for homes with children under the age of 11. We also may require a physical fence for specific dogs on a case-by-case basis, depending on each dog\u2019s behavior and exercise needs.\n\u2022  Due in part to increasing coyote activity/incidents in the area and the difficulty of predicting how a dog will respond to invisible fence training, we can not adopt to homes with invisible fences.\n\u2022  We do request vet and personal references.\n\u2022  We can facilitate adoptions within a 75-mile radius of our Cincinnati-based shelter.",

            "description": "**Due to the Covid 19 pandemic, our Adoption Team has decided to officially put all adoptions on pause. The health and safety of all involved is of utmost importance. Blind Dog Rescue Alliance prides ourselves in our very careful and thorough screening process of all applicants, and with all the current restrictions in our country, this is just not possible. We would not be able to conduct in-person home visits, a very important part of the process, nor would we be able to provide transport. As applications come in, they will be placed on hold until restrictions are lifted. Once restrictions have been lifted, we will reach out to the potential adopters to see if they are still interested before proceeding. If you have any questions please contact adoption@blinddogrescue.org. We appreciate your understanding during these difficult times.\n\nMoose is being fostered in AL. BDRA will assist with transport within reasonable distance.\n\nWhat we know about Moose:\n*loves people\n*housebroken\n*playful\n\nWhat Moose's foster mom has to say about Moose:\nMoose is such a pleasant soul to be around! He has the innocence of an angel and the rowdiness of a bull in a china shop! He doesn't meet a stranger (human or animal) and he loves everyone he meets (human and animal!). Because of the damage to his left ear (he cannot hear out of his left ear) and left eye, he tends to list a little to his good (right) side and sometimes doesn't see objects in his left peripheral vision, but he has adjusted well and doesn't miss a beat. Moose can be hard to redirect when he gets excited because he truly can\u2019t hear the commands or see some of the hand signals he may be given.\n He has had no accidents in months and goes outside to potty during the day and to enjoy the sun. He currently spends most of his days outside playing with several other dogs (Shih tzus, Lab mixes, Hounds, Terriers, Chihuahuas, Poodle, and another Pit bull). He sleep in the garage at night on his own bed and/or blanket. He loves life and is a friend to everyone he meets.\nBDRA has voted against the use of electrical fencing effective immediately,",

            "description": "Maggie has been kept outside as the surrendering owner has too many dogs to keep indoors.  She's been safe, but her owner wants her to be able to return to being an indoor companion.\n\nOn her first night at her foster's, she slept in the bed with the foster's dog. The two dogs acted like they'd always been friends.  Maggie is very good with polite dogs.  She loves her foster family, but is suspicious of strangers.  She was in a foster home with a 6 year old, but their teenage daughter was her favorite.\n\nWith a guesstimated birthday in March 2019, Maggie weighs about 45 lb.  We've included a picture of her mom, Willow.  Maggie must have gotten her pretty color from her dad.\n\nMaggie is comfy in a 42\" crate so she can sprawl.  She's leash-savvy and enjoys sniff walks.  She's reliably house-trained when kept on a regular schedule.  She doesn't come when called, so care should be taken to keep her from slipping out of the house without her leash on.\n\nWhether dogs / puppies come in as strays or owner surrenders, we usually have to make our best guess as to birthdate and breed.   \n\nIf adopted into a home with other animals, particularly cats, your new pet should be crated or secured when you're not available to supervise to insure a harmonious relationship.  \n\nA vet reference is required to confirm responsible pet ownership.  We suggest first time pet owners look for an adult dog for companionship and to gain experience.\n\nAdoption fee covers two vaccinations plus spay / neuter if using our local low-cost spay/neuter clinic (overnight stay required) and surgery occurs as agreed upon in the adoption contract.  Convenience fee equal to refundable spay/neuter deposit may be added if using our veterinarian.  Additional fees for 3rd puppy vaccination, refundable spay/neuter deposit, etc. may apply.  \n\nWe are an all-volunteer, foster-based rescue.  We receive no funding from agencies.  Available animals can be seen most Saturdays at Tractor Supply in Lenoir from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.  We recommend interested parties contact us to pre-qualify for adoption so their new furry family can go home once paperwork is complete.  Fees are required in cash.  For more information on our organization, our website is www.petpartnersrescue.org.",

He didn't like going to the vet. \nHe is a guard dog by nature and no effort was ever made to train him with basic dog manners.  \nRocky is difficult to introduce to strangers but once in his circle you are in.  We strongly suggest professional training to help him understand what is expected of him.  \nAn experienced Akita lover is in his future. \n",

I LOVE to swim and splash. Snuggling on your beach towel after sounds wonderful.\n\nWhat would constitute a perfect day for you?\n\nI want to come with you on any adventure you have planned! Starting the day with a run? Ill help motivate you to go that extra mile. Going for a hike? Count me in. Swimming? Id love to! And after weve had our fun, Id love to curl up next to you with a good bone and fall asleep while you rub my ears.\n\n \n\n*Duke is on a training plan and requires more than one visit with our Behavior team. If you are interested in meeting Duke, please contact us at adoptions@pawscrossedny.org for more information!*\n\nBefore you can adopt sweet Duke, please complete an adoption application on our website at pawscrossedny.org! Once your application is approved, you will receive a link to schedule an appointment online. If you have any questions about Duke, please email us at adoptions@pawscrossedny.org for more information. Please understand we cannot hold any pet. All adoptions are done on a first come, first adopt basis for approved applicants.\n\nThe Shelter software system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of our dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We encourage you to select your new companion by considering each dog's individual personality and pet qualities instead of relying on a breed label that is only a guess.",

She has a severe birth defect that has caused luxating patellas and rotating tibias. This creates mobility issues because she cannot straighten her back legs. She is not a surgical candidate so the best option is to get her a wheel chair. She currently can walk and go in/out to potty on her own. She is not in pain at this time. Her condition will only continue to deteriorate unfortunately and we consider her a hospice case since we cannot guarantee her mobility long term. She is the sweetest most loving girl and would love nothing more than a human to bond with and love on!",

ALL DOGS LISTED ARE AVAILABLE.\n\n** Please read the bio in its entirety before emailing with questions or submitting an application**\n\nAs we are an all volunteer rescue with limited time to respond to emails, if you email us with questions that have already been answered in the bio, we won't be able to respond. We are being inundated with emails at the moment. Thank you for your understanding!\n\nBamm-Bamm here, and foster mom said I need to tell you all about me.\n\nI'm 6 years old, have lots of energy and am the sweetest Chihuahua my foster mom has ever met! I love everyone I meet. I'm pretty tall, but only weigh about 6 lbs. Other dog friends would be great to have in my forever home, although not a requirement, as long as they're small like me. Big dogs scare me so I scream when they get too close, and then I frighten them with my screaming. Cats are fine though.\n\nLeashes scare me and I may try to bite you if you attempt to put one on me, so a fenced in yard that's safe for a little guy like me is a must. I'm also finicky about being picked up so I'd prefer to be in a home where the people don't want to carry me. I'm crate trained and don't mind hanging out in there when no one is home. I love, love, love little stuffed animals that are just my size that I can carry around the house.\n\nAll of my vet care is done. I had a dental when I became a PawPrints dog, and they got me neutered, up to date on vaccines, and I'm heartworm negative.\n\nIf you have specific needs that aren't addressed in the bio (children in the home, small animals, apartment/condo living, etc) please email to ask if the dog is suitable for the environment before submitting an application. Once the application is submitted, please expect someone to email you with questions and/or provide more information about the dog is we are unsure that the dog may be a good fit.\n\nMost importantly, please be honest! We have many people tell us what they think we want to read, not what's truthful. If there are discrepancies, your application will be denied. It's important for us to place dogs in a home that's suitable. You may be a stellar owner but possibly not a good fit for the dog you were first interested in adopting. We're not trying to offend anyone, we're trying to set everyone up for success. We're a best fit rescue and will verify your vet and personal references.\n\nMy adoption application can be found at www.pawprintsnky.com.\n\n*6 years old\n\n*Likes small dogs\n\n* Good with cats\n\n* Will not walk on a leash, so he must have a fenced in yard\n\n*Loves everyone but needs a home with no young children, due to his size.\n\nWhile viewing our available dogs, please understand that:\n\nIf you have a fence, it must be a physical fence\nWe do check persona and veterinary references. All current pets must be up to date on Rabies, spayed or neutered and on heartworm prevention (dogs).\nAdopters MUST live within a 2 hour radius of Florence Ky. (sorry, no exceptions)\nPlease do not ask us to make an exception for you. We give great consideration to the needs of each dog and the basic requirements are based on what we believe to be best for the dog.\nMeet and greets are arranged with an approved application which can be found online at pawprintsnky.com\nWhen you send messages/emails through adoption sites, our website, etc they all go to the same inbox. Sending multiple emails/messages to us actually delays our response to you.",

ALL DOGS LISTED ARE AVAILABLE.\n\nWe will not consider applications for Chloe where there is no other small dog already in the home. As she is a skittish dog, she needs a home that has a dog who is already settled and can help her acclimate to her forever home.\n\nAll dogs listed are available. The listing will be removed when we have an approved application.\n\nChloe is a sweet, but shy, 2 year old, 6 lb Chihuahua/Terrier.\n\nShe is wary of strangers but sweet with people she knows. Chloe likes other small dogs, tends to chase cats and would prefer a quieter home (she hides when she is overwhelmed but can handle living in a multi-pet household), and needs another small dog companion\n\nShe is skittish so older children are okay but younger children would be too much for her. House training is a work in progress.\n\nChloe is available with for a minimum donation of $212. She is spayed, up to date on vaccinations, heartworm tested and micro chipped.\n\n* Small dogs okay\n* Needs a small dog companion\n* No larger dogs\n* No cats\n* Older children okay\n* She is a skittish dog so a fenced yard is a must.\n\nWhile viewing our available dogs, please understand that\n\nAdopters MUST live within a 2 hour radius of Florence Ky. (sorry, no exceptions)\nWhen you send messages/emails through adoption sites, our website, etc they all go to the same inbox. Sending multiple emails/messages to us actually delays our response to you.\n\nIf you have specific needs that aren't addressed in the bio (children in the home, small animals, apartment/condo living, etc) please email to ask if the dog is suitable for the environment before submitting an application. Once the application is submitted, please expect someone to email you with questions and/or provide more information about the dog is we are unsure that the dog may be a good fit.\n\nMost importantly, please be honest! We have many people tell us what they think we want to read, not what's truthful. If there are discrepancies, your application will be denied. It's important for us to place dogs in a home that's suitable. You may be a stellar owner but possibly not a good fit for the dog you were first interested in adopting. We're not trying to offend anyone, we're trying to set everyone up for success. We're a best fit rescue and will verify your vet and personal references.\n\nAdoption Process:\n\nStep 1: Complete a \"no obligation\" application on our website, www.pawprintsnky.com\n\nStep 2: PawPrints will review the application, verifying Vet and personal references as well as landlord requirements/restrictions (if applicable)\n\nStep 3: IF your application is approved, we will call you to schedule a meet and greet for you to meet the pet.\n\nStep 4: If the meet and greet goes well, we will schedule the home visit.",

Vets and volunteers have worked hard to stabilize her and set her back on path to a normal life. Kenzie will need to stay on a restricted diet and receive insulin injections twice every day. Her untreated diabetes also led to cataracts and so little Kenzie is blind. She still likes to chase squirrels, though, using her hearing and sense of smell to let her know where the little critters are.\n\nKenzie has been spayed, vaccinated, and microchipped. Her adoption donation is $350 which includes at least a month\u2019s insulin and syringes, 6 months heartworm preventative meds, free microchip registration, and a safety harness.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Kenzie Ann, please review the adoption process and fill out the application on our website: wsrh.com\n\nAll dogs are available until \u201cAdoption Pending\u201d is noted next to their names. WSRH DOES NOT HAVE A PUBLIC SHELTER. ALL OF OUR DOGS ARE FOSTERED IN PRIVATE HOMES. Approved adopters only will be invited to meet the dogs.",

I have short legs but am a full-bodied gal. I am around 4-5 years old.\nI go outside to play with 2 other girls here and do quite well with them. I can't be around cats or other small animals, and should only be around older children.\nI love to go for walks and getting treats, but my favorite past-time is destroying squeaky toys. I take a bit of time to warm up to new people and may need more than one visit to get to know you.\nI am heartworm negative and on prevention. I'm up to date on vaccines and dewormings. I have already been spayed.\nWe are open by appointment only; email shorespca@gmail.com to request an application as we are arranging visits after applications are submitted.",

He loves his walks and makes interesting snorts the whole time (because EVERYTHING needs to be sniffed!  He does \"sit\" but doesn't seem to know any other commands, yet!  He likes to chase a ball, too!  He's been reactive to some of our other males, so will likely do best in a home where he's the only male.  Come check out Raul and our other dogs available for adoption at 2650 Washington Blvd, Crescent City, CA 95531.\n\nWe pre-screen adopters interested in the Pit Bull Terrier blends at Del Norte Animal Control, and an adoption application will be required from those interested in providing a fab furever home to Raul.

Her behaviors and interaction with her humans is less than a typical dog. \nLily would prefer a quieter and less active household.  She does not see or hear well and is cautious when roaming around but does navigate her home well once she knows it. She requires daily eye drops for a condition called Keratitis/Pannus in both eyes. Lily is also on medication for seizures which she has acquired just recently. Her medication keeps it at bay but it does make her a little more sleepy than normal. She does like to go on short walks but is just as happy napping for as many hours as you'll let her. She is 10 to 12 years old and is a Lhasa Apso mix. She is about 15lbs. She is spayed and current on vaccines. She is very sweet and would love a home where she can live out her life as comfortable as possible and have a human that will provide her all the care that she needs.\nPlease fill out our application at www.clawsadopt.org to receive a call back. Her foster mom is able to describe in detail all that Lily would need and what to expect and what not to expect from her.\n(THIS DOG IS ONLY AVAILABLE FOR ADOPTION WITHIN 90 MILES OF CLOSTER, NJ)",

She knows basic commands, walks well on a leash and enjoys getting a bath! She's an active old girl with a big heart and so much love to give. She loves to go on adventures and rides great in a car. She should be the only pet in the home because she craves so much attention and she would prefer to not have to compete with other dogs. She also tends to think cats are food instead of friends!\n\nIf you're interested in adding this piggy potato to your home, then please submit an application here: www.rejoycefulrescue.com/adopt/adoption-application",

At this point in my life  really need to be the only animal.  I am doing exceptionally well in my training class because I am a very sweet girl.    Please consider giving me a forever loving home, especially if you have a fenced yard I can run and play in.  Better I be without other dogs just to be safe.  But is good with people and kids. .

            "description": "Chanel is a senior girl, born December 6, 2007. 30 lbs. She looks like a schnauzer/dachshund mix. Understands commands in English and Spanish. She would love a quiet, loving home. She is with us after her longtime owner, an elderly woman, no longer could take care of her. She is leash trained, and okay with other dogs... Not cats and doesn't want her face touched. Maybe after she gets really acquainted with you.... She barks to let you know she needs out or if she needs food/water. Does not like to be picked up. Sleeps on doggie bed in our bedroom by the heater.\nShe has had a recent dental and has her rabies shot and is spayed. See her video on front patio!\nIn September, Chanel was filmed by HBO for a show to help rescued dogs get adopted!\nPlease find our applications and valuable information under 'Adopt a dog'* on our website: *www.beaglesandbuddies.com* and email your application to beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Let us know your preference of appointment day/time and which dogs you are interested in and we will do our best to accommodate and email you the closest appointment available. Please allow us up to a week to get back to you. Most appointments will be Friday-Sunday, 10 am - 2 pm, for an hour.\n*Note bring any other dog/s and the entire family to your meet and greet at B&B.* A complimentary training manual is included with each adoption, authored by terristeuben.com. Check out her website - she is fabulous!\nB&B is glad to be open during the pandemic. We know the value and comfort of a loving pet companion and are doing our best to help the dogs and folks who need them. We update our website daily and are always rescuing, vetting, rehabilitating, socializing.\n* We are accepting applications for volunteers to spend time with our dogs, hang out, sing/read to the shy ones, walk/toss ball with those who go to the playgrounds; cleaning, office work, gardening, and building/repair projects! *\n\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment. Please look at our website and make a list of one or more dogs that you would like to see.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf you have a question about adopting, giving up a dog, boarding, or volunteering, please visit the appropriate tabs on our\nhome page.\n\nFor more specific questions, call 626-444-9664 (please leave a voicemail if no answer) or email at beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Note that\nEmailing\nis always preferred!\n\nThanks!\n\nPlease note: If you are viewing this profile anywhere other than Beagles & Buddies own website, you are not receiving full info.

            "description": "September update: Eight months have come and gone and Kayden still waits. Shelter life is not his thing and he isn't showing us his true personality. All he wanted to do was sniff the ground and stare down the empty cat kennels. He didn't want treats. He didn't seek attention from the volunteers. He just wanted to sniff the ground and walk around. Poor guy needs a home to show him what it is like to be a family member.\nMay update: Poor Kayden is still struggling with his new life. He is better with people, but unsure of other dogs and hides as much as possible. Can you give Kayden the home he seeks? We were able to see a little more of Kaydens personality this weekend. We had him out for a long time on Saturday in hopes to get to know him a little better. Kayden is strong and persistent. He seems indifferent towards his handler and towards other dogs; however, he was not aggressive towards other dogs. We would recommend slow introductions with non-reactive dogs. We would recommend a home without cats for Kayden.\n\n**Please note this animal is not with AAVA - we are networking for rescue/foster/adopter as the liaison for the shelter Visit AAVArescue.com for more information on how to save a shelter animal. Or contact us at: (337)366-0212 voicemail/text . Email: aavarescue@gmail.com",

I love to run fast and play with tennis balls but only for about ten minutes, then I get tired. In my spare time I hang out with our Adoption Coordinator, Mikayla, and the rest of our staff, getting lots of belly rubs and face scratches. I'm still a young guy so I don't have the best manners but my human friends say I'm super smart and I learn fast! I don't do great with cats and I'm not sure how to interact calmly with dogs yet, but I'm going through classes so maybe I can get better. I would love a home that will give me the right amount of exercise and training, and will be patient with my reactivity towards other animals. \n\nI was born around 08/07/2018 and I am neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccinations. \n\nIf you're interested in adopting me please call 231-924-9230 or fill out an application on my shelter's website at\nwww.bellwetherharbor.org/adoptions/application-for-adoption/",

This handsome little guy  was found in an orchard with five other dogs when he was barely a year old.  Jase is a playful little guy with certain dogs.  He loves his treats! He has been neutered, dewormed, Frontlined, vaccinations are current, and he has been microchipped. Jase is very shy; he has come a long way but has more to go, he is great with other dogs and would be fine with another dog in a calm, loving adult home. Jase loves to play, and will be a great little companion. He should have a canine playmate and we are working on leash-training. Jase seems potty trained and is a house dog. He loves to snuggle with a calm older dog and will need a very patient loving home.If you are interested in this dog or would like more information Please scroll down to the  \u201cMORE ABOUT US\u201d button Click that .

            "description": "Harley came to us recently (January, 2020) after being adopted from an animal shelter by a couple who hoped she would keep company with their elderly female Dobie. Unfortunately they found that Harley wasn't agreeable to the arrangement. She certainly doesn't enjoy meeting other dogs on leash and we don't think living with female dogs is a good idea, but she has been sharing her kennel peacefully with a large, male Dobie. With people, Harley is a darling; she loves attention and is patient and sweet. She is believed to be about 3 years old. The people that adopted her briefly from the shelter kept her outdoors, so it isn't known whether she is housebroken, but what we have observed first-hand is that she can either climb or vault over a 6' link fence, so she'll need a secure yard with a high fence or wall. Everyone who sees Harley asks about her, due to her beauty and innate charm.",

He is a \"hard-mouthed\" dog and actually did break skin minorly when interacting with a kennel staff member, so he was then quarantined for the bite and made \"rescue-only.\"  During Cannon's stay with us, it appears that he merely engages in rough play, and an experienced adopter should be able to work through this behavior with him, either through professional training or electronic aids or both.  Cannon has been kenneled alone since he wasn't able to live with another dog long-term during his stay with us.  This dog will also require at least moderate daily exercise to release some of his energy.  We are also seeking an adult owner for him.",

Volunteers come in specifically to see this special boy!  Miller is crate trained and knows his basic commands.  He should not be with cats.  He is a big, lovable tank of a boy weighing in at 80 pounds.  If you would like to make this big boy a member of your family, please go to hamburgmutts.org and fill out our application.\n\nAdoption Location\n\nPlease note that we only adopt out dogs to owners in the United States and within 50 miles of Buffalo, NY. We do this to ensure that our volunteers do not have to travel far when they conduct home visits and take dogs for meet and greets. Keeping adopted dogs local also enables us to provide assistance to new owners as needed. If you do not live the Buffalo area we would be happy to help you find a rescue that is close to where you are!\n\n",

            "description": "HAPPY girl Demi is so much fun!! As soon as Demi arrived, she showed us her super fun and adventurous side! She is a real active girl who loves to play, play, PLAY! Gentle games of tug, leaping high in the air for her rope toy, climbing up and over logs in the woods and sprint races through the fence with new friends Finney and Poe are all in a days work for Demi! With all of that time running around, she is still ready for more fun time! \n\nDemi has shown to be super calm in her kennel.. which tells us that she has a nice inside \"chill button.\"\n\nIt's very clear to us that Demi has been abused in her previous home situation. We don't have her history.. but sadly she will often cower or flinch if an object or hand is raised. We believe Demi was born an exuberant, zesty, outgoing doggie but situations and unkind humans have taught her otherwise. We always tell her no one will EVER hurt her again and she is safe from here on out!! Sweet Girl <\n\nUpon meeting someone new Demi is sweet and soft, approaches with caution and she appreciates some space to come and go on her own when meeting people for the first time. Demi is super easy to engage and is a big foodie.. treats and play is the way into Demi's darling heart! So learning to trust a new friend doesn't take much time at all! \n\nBe sure to check out our website for more photos of delightful DEMI! fortheloveofdogsrescue.org",

They were rescued off the streets by a good samaritan that could not keep them. They basically had been raised \"on the streets\".\n\nRadar was shy at first but has really came out of his shell. He loves to run and play. He gets excited about lots of things, he is goofy and curious. \n\nRadar would do well in a home with another outgoing dog, he is good with kids, cats are unknown. Right now, he is working on basic commands. He is current on shots, neutered and on heartworm prevention. For adoption, please visit our website at www.myhstc.org\n\nAdoption fee is $85 which includes all vet work\n\nWe prescreen all applicants prior to a meeting. To be screened, you may submit an adoption application at www.myhstc.org",

            "description": "? Adopt Freddy ? \n\nFreddy boy here is a 1 yr old pitbull mix with (we suspect) pointer. He is neutered, microchipped, HW negative and up to date on vaccinations and preventatives. He was treated for a broken leg when he was at the shelter, it has healed very nicely! \n\nAnyone familiar with these breeds knows this equates ENERGY. Freddy is the living embodiment of pure caffeine. He\u2019s not one but TWO double shots of espresso. If Chris Traeger from Parks and Rec were a dog, it\u2019s Freddy. He is happy, sweet, hyper, and LOVES to run. He would be the most excellent buddy for anyone who enjoys running marathons for fun, hiking adventures, or anyone who loves being around another extraordinarily positive being from the moment they open their eyes in the morning until they fall asleep again at night. 10/10, he will encourage you to push 10 more miles on your evening jog, you can do it fren! \n\nIn all seriousness, Freddy is a very high energy guy. He is crate trained, and doing well with being housebroken if kept on a schedule. He really needs someone who is willing to complete training classes with him, because as it stands the energy just flows through him like a windy Oklahoma day during tornado season. He needs a similar sized dog with similar energy to be his best friend and playmate. No young children or small dogs/cats, they will not be able to handle his energy.\n\nWe plan to send Freddy through obedience training before he is officially adopted. You can apply to meet him now, though! Www.muttmisfits.com/adoption-application",

We do not ship our dogs and all adoptions are completed in person in the Oklahoma City, Oklahoma area.\nHi. My name is Roxie. I am a terrier mix that is eight years old and I weigh about 42 pounds. I came to the rescue years ago as puppy and was adopted but was recently returned. My fur sister and I got into a fight but no one knows why. I mean we have lived together for years with no problems so I am just not sure what happened. Anyways, I am looking for a new home now...it's best to have a home as an only fur child.\nI am smart and well trained. I know all my basic obedience and a few extra tricks. I am crate trained and house trained. I am a happy girl that loves to run and play or just hang out with you. I have a soft scruffy coat. I will bark and let you know if anyone is at the fence or the door. I wasn't raised around children so it would be a good idea if they were older. I am loyal and loving. Maybe we could take some walks together?\nI am current on vaccinations, am spayed, and micro chipped. My adoption fee is 150.00. The first step in the adoption process is to complete and application for me, Roxie, at dogsasfamily.org. I am ready to share my sweet smile and devotion with you.",

After his neutering and vaccinations were completed, he left for his new home.  Unfortunately, Elvis has been returned after there were changes in the home that were not really his fault.  His age is around 3 and 1/2 years old and he weighs about 70 pounds.  Elvis is a very lovable boy, but confused about being back here!  He loves to be petted and that calms him.  Once he settles in and gets on your routine, he is a wonderful companion for you.  He loves attention and just wants you to love him.  Elvis is a smart boy and likes to learn.  We do not recommend that he live with cats.  Elvis would like to meet people that will provide the forever home he deserves!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

He came to the shelter with a few marks on his record, but since being here, we have fallen in love with him! Understandably, Helios has a few trust issues, and it will take time getting to know him and earn his tail wags and cuddles, but who ever said dating was all fun and games? Helios loves long walks with his person with an occasional stop to graze on blades of grass. He makes sure to live up to his cow-colored coat! Helios is also super-duper dog social and we think he would love to live with a playful doggie friend! Helios was once a sweet-loving family dog but he needs proper intros to new people, and would do best in a low-traffic home. He enjoys a good game of tug-of-war, is well-behaved when left alone in the home, and he is house trained (although like many shelter dogs, he may need a refresher course)! What more is there to ask for in such a cute, little dude? If you think you're ready to commit for the long haul, email the shelter about Helios and his staff advocates can tell you all about him!

He has peacefully shared his kennel with different large female dogs over time so we are confident he can live in a home with a female dog; we're not sure about males.  Audi has a lot of potential waiting to be unlocked by the right owner.  Audi is almost three years old now (mid-April, 2020) and he has been with us for about 1 1/2 years.",

            "description": "Sophie is a 4 year old black/tan female Doberman. She is a sweet and sassy, independent girl. Sophie knows what she wants and is willing to allow you to provide it for her. She is always curious with meeting people because she is looking to see if you have anything edible. She will dart off if strangers try to pet her. \nSophie has cropped ears but very sadly it appears that her ear crop was a \"home job\". It is incredibly sad to think about what Sophie went through while someone butchered her ears so it\u2019s no surprise that Sophie has extreme trust issues with people. Sophie came to us from a shelter as a stray. She probably escaped from the horrid people who butchered her ears and had used her as a breeder. She had pressure sores that makes you think she was confined a lot. Thankfully Sophie is not there anymore. \nShe is with DAR&E in a foster home where her needs and wants are catered to. Sophie is a very smart, independent lady. She is quite the charming Diva :)  Sophie has been with us for about a year. She has grown to trust us somewhat. She still gets nervous if she thinks she is being trapped or thinks you are trying to grab or subdue her. It took months for her to trust me enough to dry her off after being out in the rain. She is afraid of being confined in a crate or small space. \nSophie has come to enjoy pets and rubs from us but will still dart off sometimes if she feels uncertain. Sophie enjoys car rides but you have to grab her and put her in the car. She is afraid to walk on a leash. Sophie resists anything that is new and out of her routine. This presents certain challenges but day to day she has her routine and is quite happy. Of course in a new home it would take months for her to get to that point again. \nIn addition, Sophie has an extreme oral fixation. If she can chew and swallow something, she will eat it. She is extremely curious about everything and immediately seeks to check to see if it is edible. She will eat anything remotely soft and pliable. Furniture, rugs dog beds, non-durable toys, household items, etc. Her food obsession has been helpful in establishing a routine with her. Sophie is house trained as long as you let her out when she indicates she needs to go. If not, she isn't apt to hold it for long. \nSophie can be quite snarly toward other dogs. I am not sure she would hurt a dog but she puts up a good show. She really doesn't want dogs near her food so she will be best as an only dog.  Sophie needs a very patient caretaker; one that accepts her on her terms and has the ability to keep her safe from her eating obsession. \n Here are a couple videos of our dear, sweet Sophie: https://youtu.be/-HahED8NEzU  Sophie playing: https://youtu.be/pbFzeSXLLyQ\n\nDAR&E places dogs in MD, DC, VA and parts of WVA only.  \nIf you are interested in this pet please follow the link below to read about our adoption process and submit an adoption application.

            "description": "Sophie is a 4 year old black/tan female Doberman. She is a sweet and sassy, independent girl. Sophie knows what she wants and is willing to allow you to provide it for her. She is always curious with meeting people because she is looking to see if you have anything edible. She will dart off if strangers try to pet her. \nSophie has cropped ears but very sadly it appears that her ear crop was a \"home job\". It is incredibly sad to think about what Sophie went through while someone butchered her ears so it\u2019s no surprise that Sophie has extreme trust issues with people. Sophie came to us from a shelter as a stray. She probably escaped from the horrid people who butchered her ears and had used her as a breeder. She had pressure sores that makes you think she was confined a lot. Thankfully Sophie is not there anymore. \nShe is with DAR&E in a foster home where her needs and wants are catered to. Sophie is a very smart, independent lady. She is quite the charming Diva :)  Sophie has been with us for about a year. She has grown to trust us somewhat. She still gets nervous if she thinks she is being trapped or thinks you are trying to grab or subdue her. It took months for her to trust me enough to dry her off after being out in the rain. She is afraid of being confined in a crate or small space. \nSophie has come to enjoy pets and rubs from us but will still dart off sometimes if she feels uncertain. Sophie enjoys car rides but you have to grab her and put her in the car. She is afraid to walk on a leash. Sophie resists anything that is new and out of her routine. This presents certain challenges but day to day she has her routine and is quite happy. Of course in a new home it would take months for her to get to that point again. \nIn addition, Sophie has an extreme oral fixation. If she can chew and swallow something, she will eat it. She is extremely curious about everything and immediately seeks to check to see if it is edible. She will eat anything remotely soft and pliable. Furniture, rugs dog beds, non-durable toys, household items, etc. Her food obsession has been helpful in establishing a routine with her. Sophie is house trained as long as you let her out when she indicates she needs to go. If not, she isn't apt to hold it for long. \nSophie can be quite snarly toward other dogs. I am not sure she would hurt a dog but she puts up a good show. She really doesn't want dogs near her food so she will be best as an only dog.  Sophie needs a very patient caretaker; one that accepts her on her terms and has the ability to keep her safe from her eating obsession. \n Here are a couple videos of our dear, sweet Sophie: https://youtu.be/-HahED8NEzU  Sophie playing: https://youtu.be/pbFzeSXLLyQ\n\nDAR&E places dogs in MD, DC, VA and parts of WVA only.  \nIf you are interested in this pet please follow the link below to read about our adoption process and submit an adoption application.

We are in need of folks who have time to fund raise or some admin/social media work and application processors. We are also in need of fosters. If you have room on your couch and in your heart to take on a dog (we will try to match the type of foster that would best suit your home/experience) from anywhere to a couple weeks to a couple months (we never know for sure).  Some training experience would be a plus. Each dog that we're looking to send to foster has something that they need to work on. If you think you might be interested or interested in volunteering in another way, please email melissa.motleyrescue@gmail.com. You can read more about us and the dogs we rescue at www.motleymuttsrescue.com. Thank you for stopping by~",

            "description": "Meet Deacon, he is a lab mix with a great personality uh, dog-anality. He is house trained and leash trained. Deacon can be a jumper and loves to run in his yard, so a 6 ft fenced in yard is a must for this boy. If you want to see pure joy, watch him when he is playing with toys. It goes to a whole new level if the toy has a squeaker, those are his absolute favorite. He does not like taking a bath, having someone hold his feet, or getting his nails cut. He's your typical guys guy - not metrosexual at all. Who needs all that floofy stuff anyway? Deacon is going to do best if he is the only animal in the home. He is not a fan of small dogs or kids, he may chase cats, and he may be too high energy for larger dogs. Deacon was bounced around a bit before he went to his foster home, due to that he can be slow to warm up.. But once you are his person - he desires nothing more than to be by your side and have squeaky toys. Did I mention he loves squeaky toys? He would do best with someone that is home a majority of the time. Deacon is still figuring out the world and will need someone who will be patient with him he can't just be thrown into new situations and expect to thrive. A good example, is those spooky moving doors at PetSmart. He doesn't understand them and we'll be honest, they freak him out a little - but he's learning. Deacon weighs approximately 45 lbs and has been neutered. If you think Deacon would make a good addition to your family, fill out an application at lastdaydogs.com 2/2/21 4:21 PM",

To arrange a meet and greet with a dog, you MUST fill out the adoption application so that it can be sent to the foster parent for review to determine if your home is a match for the dog. If a dog receives multiple applications, we operate on a best-fit basis, not first come first served.***\n\n**Sophia is currently housed at our center after a tree fell through her foster parents home. She is looking for an adoptive home or a foster home.**\n\nMeet Sophie, a sassy older Jack Russell with the most lovely personality. She may be an oldie, but she's definitely a goody. She has a heart of gold with a sweet temperament to go with it. She loves everyone she meets and has a lot of love to give! \n\nSophia likes to go for walks and hardly barks. She loves using the doggy door at her foster home and is in and out all day long. Sophia has taken advantage of the front door being open for too long, and has been known to take her own walk upon occasion. Luckily, she is easy to catch, but any potential adopter should be aware of this risk and take precautions to prevent it from happening! Her foster home currently has a sign up warning all visitors that an escape artist lives there, and has had no issues since. \n\nSophia would make a good companion for a retired couple, or for someone that has a lot of time to spend with her. She is sensitive to loud noises, and for this reason is looking for a home with no small children. She would need some kind of yard in which to play and would be beyond excited to have a doggy door to use in her forever home! Sophia does have some early signs of hearing and vision loss, but that has not held her back from enjoying and loving life! She is healthy overall, and still has that lovable spunk about her! \n\nSophia is currently taking Proin to keep her from leaking urine and gabapentin to help her old lady discomfort related to degenerative disk disease. She will need to remain on these medications for the rest of her life. This sweet old gal can't wait to find a forever home of her own! \n\nSophia is spayed, up to date on vaccinations, microchipped, has been dewormed, and is current on her monthly preventatives. Her adoption fee is $300. For additional questions about Sophia, please email the Dog Program Manager at laura@secondchancenc.org. To adopt Sophia, please go to our website and fill out an adoption application! Thanks!",

If pre-approved, you have first priority & can usually take home your new best friend the same day!  \n\n*Please note that there is no obligation to adopt by completing an application.*\n\n**All dogs are required to be fully vetted. Shots, rabies, spay/nueter and microchip.  This is all covered in Adoption fee. Some may still need vetting done due to age, size, breed and health. All vetting will be done by rescues vet clinic.",

Foster mom said she is really looking for a super special home for me. You see, she rescued me from an overfull shelter when I was about to take the walk. The people at the shelter said that I had deteriorated while I was there, going from a very social guy to moody and only liking one of the staff members and growling at everyone else. Foster mom said she would take a chance on me and I am so glad she did! I was very stressed in the shelter, the confinement mixed with all the noise and smells had me overwhelmed and I wasn't sure how to act since I had never left my previous owners home before. It took me a while to warm up to foster mom but now we are best friends! I would follow her anywhere now that she is one of my people!\n\n My favorite thing to do is try to knock her down while running between her legs (she's not that tall and all 110+lbs of me definitely has the ability to knock her off balance with my shenanigans). After my rescue, it still took me quite a while to figure out that people are not scary and that I could make all kinds of new friends who would love on me just as much as foster mama. Now, as long as I get a chance to say hello on my terms I make new people friends quite nicely. I still probably wont ever be the kind of dog who just runs up to strangers looking for love though but that is just a part of who I am!\n\n True to my breed, I am super smart! I already know sit and down but I cannot promise I will hold them long because I am just so excitable over love and attention. Foster mom also says I really could use some work on my leash manners. I am very strong (how could I not be for my size??) and still think that I can dictate where we go. I am getting better though and I know with time and training I could be even better. I need to go to a home where I am the only pet. Foster mom does not trust me around kitties as they look like way too much fun to chase. While I love to run the fence-line with other dogs, she says she still cant quite get a read on how I would do actually living with another dog. I get really talkative and bounce around a lot which could just be playfulness but because of my size and strength foster mom thought it best not to push too far. \n\nI also require a physical fence in my adoptive home. Foster mom says it is best for me so that I can do all of my private business in peace, off-leash and so that walks can be for training and socialization time. As much as I like foster moms young kids, I am not suited for a home with anyone under 16 years old. That super happy exuberance I have around my people would wind up knocking kids over too much and it just is not a good match for me.\n\n My adoption fee is $300 which includes my neuter, microchip and registration, vaccinations, deworming, and being started on heartworm and flea/tick preventions. Additional questions about me can be emailed to my foster mom at jones@secondchancenc.org If you feel like you could be that super special family that I am looking for, please apply to adopt me at https://www.secondchancenc.org/adopt-a-pet/dog-adoption-application/?src=sidebar\"\"",

            "description": "***All animals listed on our website are in private foster homes. To arrange a meet and greet with a dog, you MUST fill out the adoption application so that it can be sent to the foster parent for review to determine if your home is a match for the dog. If a dog receives multiple applications, we operate on a best-fit basis, not first come first served.***\n\n**Must have a back yard**Must have another dog**Must foster before adopting due to special needs** My name is Clark! My foster mom tells me I am a very handsome boy. I have eyes that will enchant you with just one glance! But it's very important to know that you can't look into my puppy eyes for too long, or it will scare me. I was feral when I was trapped in a rural county, and I am still a special boy in need of a very understanding, patient, and loving home. If you stare at me too long I will bark at you, to let you know that you are making me nervous. That is because I am brand new to living with a family and I do not trust humans. The good news is, I LOVE OTHER DOGS, so I would be a great companion dog for another dog. Dogs who are new to living in family homes require very special owners. My foster mom says that my forever home will have an owner who is patient. She says that means they will have to let me decide things on my own and try not to force me into too many situations too fast. Owning me as a puppy will not be like owning a regular puppy. You won't be able to show me off to all of your family and friends right away and you especially won't be able to cuddle me right away. It can be hard to resist but I will need a confident owner who puts up boundaries around human interaction until it is clear I am comfortable. I have been in foster care for months, and I have made progress, but I am still a long ways away from being a normal house pet. I may NEVER be a normal house pet, but I hope that someone will love me for who I am. My foster mom also says my new owner will be understanding and attentive. They will need to work hard to understand my triggers for fear and find new approaches to situations. For example, since I am going to be scared of you when you take me home, it will be essential for you to already have a room set up for me that is close to the family but not in a high traffic area. You will need to start gradually exposing me to your presence and building trust that when you come into the room, you aren't going to try and catch me. My foster mom thinks my new owner should be someone who has a routine and is consistent. The key to earning my trust will be building my confidence that you are going to feed me and open the door for me to go outside at around the same time everyday. I will come to depend on you for this, and that will help me come out of shell. Consistency will also help me know early on what is expected of me so I can start to grow into a dog who has confidence in himself. Speaking of potty-ing! You will need a yard for me with a fence that has no gaps in it! Right now I am not able to walk on a leash. That will take extensive work from my new owner if I am ever going to be expected to walk on a leash! That means I have to have a yard in order to explore, get exercise, and learn. This is not a forever issue, but it will not be an easy road to get me on the leash. My foster mom also strongly recommends that the home I go to does not have young children. I do seem to trust kids more than adults, but if a child were to push a boundary the last thing foster mom would want is for me to bite a kid out of fear. To be clear, I have never bitten anyone, but it is better to be cautious and upfront from the get go. It is also beneficial that my new home be more laid back, with few visitors. At least until I am in a better spot. I do love other dogs. It could speed up the trust and learning process if my new home has a well trained dog leader in it. I am likely to follow them on the routine and look to them to understand if I can trust you and the situation. The more I watch a human pet, play, and talk to my dog sibling the more I get interested in getting to know that human. The other dog gives me a sense of safety. I know I sound like a lot of work, and in some ways I am. However, if I find my forever home with an owner who works hard to make us teammates it will be a bond unlike any other. I am neutered, up to date on vaccines, microchipped, and current on my monthly flea/tick and heartworm preventatives. Since I am special needs, my adoption fee is reduced.

Just copy and paste the link below into your browser (or simply type it in) and then search for the dog's \"gallery\" by name\n\n          http://adoptasleddog.smugmug.com\n\nVIDEOS:  In addition to photo albums, almost every dog has a video which will give you a much better \"feel\" for his or her personality.  NOTE:  In the new Petfinder format, it has become quite a bit more difficult to find and to play videos.  Please PAGE THROUGH the photos, looking for a photo overlaid in the center with a \"play\" arrow inside a circle.  This icon is white, so it can be difficult to see. \n In many (most) cases, the video is the last photo displayed as you page through.  Just click on that photo and it will play.  Please make sure you CHECK ON THE PETFINDER VIDEO ICON, above, to see a video of this wonderful dog!  Our videos will include, at a minimum, whatever info we had on the dog upon (or shortly after) his/her arrival into our program.  There will sometimes be video updates as well.  And in every case, our Adoptions Coordinator can be emailed at ADOPTASLEDDOG@AOL.COM to answer questions and provide the most current information we have on the dog.  \n\nNOTES:  Please see video or contact our Adoptions Coordinator at ADOPTASLEDDOG@AOL.COM.\n\nADOPTION DONATION:  $250  Before adoption, all Northern Lights dogs (regardless of whether Petfinder's symbols appear) are spayed or neutered, microchipped, heartworm negative, fully vaccinated and tested/treated for known parasites.\n \nWHAT TO DO IF YOU WANT TO ADOPT THIS DOG:  Email us at ADOPTASLEDDOG@AOL.COM to request an application and get started.  WE DO NOT HAVE AN ONLINE APPLICATION - you will have to request one via email.  We will review your application to determine if there is a good fit between you and/or your family and this dog.  We may suggest another dog or dog(s) if we can offer a better fit in terms of lifestyle, experience, other pets, etc.  A vet check, reference checks, and a home visit will be conducted before an adoption can be considered for approval.  \n \nNORTHERN LIGHTS DOES NOT HAVE A PHYSICAL SHELTER.  We are a nonprofit rescue organization comprised of individuals who open their private homes to foster dogs in need of a second chance..  When fosters are not available, we often pay to board a dog until space is available.  New fosters and donations to pay for boarding are always desperately needed us.  Email us at KATYLIED2@AOL.COM if you are interested in donating or for information on fostering.\n \nFAQ:  For information regarding our organization, as well as adoption policies and practices, please visit our Petfinder Home Page at WWW.NORTHERNLIGHTS.PETFINDER.COM.\n \n \nNOTICE:  In the vast majority of cases, the dogs in our program and rescued from shelters, and Northern Lights has no means by which to collect or verify a dog's history.  We work in concert with our veterinarians, and breed and age estimates are based on a combination of professional input and our collective experience.  Our policy with information acquired prior to acceptance and while the dogs are in our care is that of \"full disclosure\".  It is our goal to ensure the adopter has all available information to ensure the best possible match between the dog and the adopter(s).  If we have identified a behavioral or health condition while the dog is in our care and custody, every effort will be made to correct it prior to adoption, OR the adopter will be made aware of the issue or condition prior to adoption.  Northern Lights' screening process is designed to identify only those adopters who are willing, and have the means, to treat conditions which may occur after adoption, and the adopter will be contractually responsible for doing so. However, Northern Lights' policy is to accept any adopted dog back into the program, at any time, for any reason.\n",

After getting some exercise she calmed down and focused on us.  She loved riding in the car and was very affectionate and licked our faces at every opportunity.  She will sit nicely for a treat.  Her leash manners could use some work.  We'll focus on that next weekend.  She saw some small children and wagged her tail and acted interested in meeting them.  She also saw another dog being walked.  She watched the dog but didn't get over excited or growl.  She warmed up to us quickly and although she may seem aloof at first, we think this is just a symptom of shelter anxiety and she is actually quite social. She was a joy to take out. \nShe's a little powerhouse high voltage lithium battery that seems to never need recharging. \n\nShelter staff think Maddie is about 5 years old.\n___________\n\nAll adoptions are by appointment only. Please find the animal you like in the Adoptable Pets area of our internal website and then submit a questionnaire to our adoptions team at adoptmcasac@montgomerycountymd.gov Full COVID-19 adoption procedures can be found here: https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/animalservices/adoption/covidadoption.html Website: montgomerycountyMD.gov/animalservices \n\n___________ \n\n**** PLEASE NOTE: Our adoption process can move quite quickly, and applications are considered on a first-come, first-served basis. Some animals, especially puppies/kittens and small dogs, can go very quickly. For this reason, we recommend that if you see an animal you are interested in, you send in an adoption questionnaire as soon as possible. Please do not bring your current pets to the shelter. If you intend to adopt a dog and want the new dog and your current dog to meet, that can be scheduled with the help of your Adoption Counselor. Thank you! ***** Montgomery County residents are required by law to purchase a Montgomery County Pet License for all dogs and cats at the time of adoption. Pet licenses are $12 annually for animals over 1 year and free for animals under 1 year.",

Sits on command and goes into crate on command. Loves his crate and will lay in there during the day often. Silly personality, loves to play with toys/chew bones but not energetic all day. House trained and sits by door when needs to go out. He needs a tall fenced yard. Other dogs and cars get him excited on walks, but hes older so a little exercise in the yard is all he needs.\n\nORIGINAL POST: Oreo is a 6-7 year old, 70 pound black lab mix that was picked up in south Georgia as a stray. Although a country boy, his manners are fairly refined as he sits quietly in his room in boarding while all the other dogs bark and jump and protest the confinement. He also has good potty manners and there is never a mess to clean up when they come in the morning to let them out. He loves people but doesnt have much use for other dogs and were hoping that someone will be satisfied to just have one sweet Oreo. That being said, he was out with all of the dogs at adoption day and could have cared less because he had a soft lap to sit in. He will go to a foster this week and we will have more information.\n\nIf you would like to adopt Oreo, please go to www.atlantalabrescue.com and submit an application or email info@atlantalabrescue.com for more information.",

He is now showing some signs of having arthritic pain in his joints and would do best in a home with a large grassy yard.  Erick walks well on the leash and enjoys outings. He seems to do best with female dogs. Erick will need patient owner who is willing to give him a chance.\n\nFor adoption: www.spcaeasttx.com\nFor more information: adopt@spcaeasttx.com",

She will need medication for the remainder of her life. She is a real love bug and just wants to please. We are on a mission to help this poor girl find the loving, healthy, happy home she deserves. We need to get a picture of her with her big, pink teddy bear. She loves to carry it around with her and it's adorable. It may be the first real thing she's had to call her own! Does fine around young children.\nUpdate March 4, 2014 - This is what her foster mom has to say about her:\nElsie is house trained, will bust out or destroy any kennel you put her in but luckily she is pretty well behaved in the house as long as there are no drawers or cabinet doors she can get into. Also will clear a kitchen counter really quick. Loves to chew up collars and leashes and an occasional coffee table book. She does better if she has plenty of tennis balls to tear up during the day. She is very pushy and bossy with other dogs. If someone is in the spot she wants, she will sit on them till they move. Likes to hide all the toys under the cushion of the couch so she can come back and get them later. She does not start fights, just likes things her way. No cats or small critters of any kind. Gets along with other dogs. It's amazing they tolerate her behavior.' Well, that's pretty clear!***YOU MUST FILL OUT AN APPLICATION BEFORE WE DO ANY MEET AND GREETS. QUESTIONS? CONTACT pcpoundpuppies1@gmail.com\nOur adoption fee is $150 which covers a portion of the dog's vetting costs. The adoption process includes the completion of an application followed by an interview.\nClick here to submit an adoption application: https://pcpoundpuppies.webs.com/adoption-application\n***IMPORTANT: Due to the effects of COVID-19, our Sunday adoption events at Pet Food Center have been canceled until further notice. If there is a dog you are interested in meeting, be sure to contact us and we may be able to set up a meet and greet as soon as possible.***\nYou can get in touch with us by email at pcpoundpuppies1@gmail.com or by phone at 812-483-4341 for more information.\nWe respond to inquiries and adoption applications at our earliest opportunity, but please be patient with us as we work full-time jobs and perform this service as volunteers. We do our best to return messages and schedule adoption interviews within a couple of days of receiving your application.\nThe fastest way to get the ball rolling is to complete an adoption application for the dog that caught your eye. Thank you for considering the adoption of a shelter dog! 2/2/21 6:06 PM",

He warms up to people quickly and will definitely make you laugh. He would be good with a family of older chidren since he is a strong guy but so so sweet and eager to learn. \n\nThis dog is a volunteer favorite and so amazing. \n\nBrownie would love a human and a home of his very own.\n \n",

He is a great guy whose owner realized that this breed needs exercise and is not made for couch potato apartment living! He loves to be active and be with his people:) Toys and fetch keep him plenty busy and he goes to pup daycare to play with friends his size. He is 100% housetrained with a dog door and he loves to charge around the yard in his foster home. He is good on a leash and loves walks! Zues needs a yard to run in or an exercise plan as he is a young active dog who loves to be on the go! Probably not a good match for cats. Zeus is dog selective and does best with female dogs that are about his size and like to play:) He LOVES to go hiking and walking!\n\nZues has an adoption fee of $200 and he is neutered, up to date on shots and microchipped. Please fill out an application at Helpadogsmile.org to learn more about Zues or to meet him in person! 2/1/21 7:02 PM",

She was adopted, but then given away by her owner to someone that did not treat her very well; she was eventually found as a stray and identified as a Furkid by her chip. Gia loves people and very much wants to please. She knows basic commands, is very treat motivated, and responds exceptionally well to kindness. Gia Is looking for a home where she is the only dog. She also cannot be in an apartment setting. Gia's birthdate is 2/7/2019. Her adoption fee is $275. If you want to know more about Gia and speak to an Adoption Counselor, please complete a survey at https://furkids.org/dog-adoptions/application. Must be at least 21 years of age to adopt. (If the dog you're interested in meeting is living in a foster home, the Adoption Counselor will make an appointment for you to meet the dog at the shelter.) Follow us on Facebook at www.facebook.com/furkidsinc!\n\nBe sure to visit and \"like\" our Facebook page facebook.com/furkidsinc",

He seems to be selective with other dogs, but has played with a couple at the shelter. Magellan should not go to a home with children under 12 years old.

He was found chained 24/7 to a pole at just 2 months of age with no shelter from the sun or rain in a rural area in Phuket Thailand.  Mr T arrived February and is now 1-1/2 years old.  Due to needed knee repairs and covid his adoption has been delayed.  This silly clever little soul will be an amazing dog with the right confident owner.  Mr T is a dominant alpha and needs a very experienced owner.  Mr. T has the typical personality traits of a Shiba Inu/Jindo; fun, quirky, loyal, great on leash and loves walking, hiking, and playing hide and seek which he is not very good at, so you always win.  Once Mr T trusts you he loves his people!  He will talk to you, do zoomies, and walk between your legs to let you know he is there, and his portfolio of other silly antics come to life.  Pillow stealing is on that list.  Mr T is not suitable for apartment living, children or cats.  Mr T does well with other dogs engaging in play dates and at the dog park but not with dogs living in his permanent space.  Mr T can be toy and food agressive as he has had a bit of a chaotic life and needs a steady, calm, confident owner who knows his breed and know when to correct him and handle his alfa quirks.   This little guy loves to play.  He is going through training which will be completed at the end of October.  Mr T has had such a tough life.  If you think you can give Mr T a lifetime loving home please contact us at dogislooking4you@gmail.com..",

She is serious about fun. She's an active girl that loves to play with her tennis ball more than anything in the whole world! It is her entire world, and she runs so fast to get it and drop it at your feet-  whether you\u2019re four years old or an adult, her question is always the same- \u201cMore? More?\u201d She is very obedient about her ball and has good manners. She knows how to sit and wait on command. \n\nShe would make an excellent running or hiking partner.  She is a big fan of people, naps, and back scratchies.\n\nCoco is a sweetheart that would make a wonderful family dog!\n\n----\nPeach County Animal Rescue is a rescue located in Fort Valley, GA. Our adoption fees range from $250-350+. Although our rescue dogs share a common bond with one another, no rescue story is the same (even when similar). Vetting costs vary depending on their health conditions. All of our dogs are fully vetted: up-to-date on annual shots, spayed/neutered and microchipped with a lifetime registration. We look forward to hearing from you!\n\nIf you would like to send in an application for this dog, please use the link below! https://peachcountyanimalrescueandrehabilitation.org/apply-now-2/",

            "description": "!!! AVAILABLE for Adoption from Foster Care !!! REX A43851763Personality: Here's a medium dog that would love to just cuddle up with you for a movie marathon! Rex loves taking walks around the neighborhood- even five year olds have to keep their body in shape! He's shy at first, but it only takes a tiny bit of effort, a good home, and a few treats, for him to show how loving he can be!Intake Type: StrayWeight: 52 lbsMedical Observations:(2/21) Patient appears healthy, asides from being underweight and having a low grade heart murmur. Heart murmur does not preclude surgery at the shelter, however recommend adoption with medical waiver indicating heart murmur presence. Behavior Observations:(3/6) Volunteer Note -- Leash biting onsite. He doesn't go up the leash but does do that hard tug as he flips his head back and forth. Once we got moving, he dropped the leash and began walking. For the remainder of our walk he would periodically grab the leash and begin to leash bite, before dropping it voluntarily and continuing to walk. He did this several times, the episodes only lasted 10-15 seconds. So he's not a consistent leash biter but when he is doing it, he tugs hard and puts his weight into it. Returning to kennel he became a bit reactive to passing dogs as we walked through the kennels. No issues returning to kennel.(2/28) Short Term foster -- Rex is a very sweet and gentle dog. He was shy at first, but showed improvement each day by coming out of his shell when he was with me.(2/21) Lifesaving -- Slight hesitation but overall easy to loop. Distracted going back in but no real issues. Pulls on leash and would do best harnessed, but manageable if not. Aroused but allows all over handling. Will come to handler for more pets when stopped. Engages in tag/chase games followed by LOTS of zoomies! Will jump on handler gently. No interest in toys at this time. Suggested Running Team. Evaluated Gold.(2/21) Per Vet Staff -- Friendly(2/18) Per Finder -- Friendly, well mannered, sweetThis animal is currently available from foster care through ACCT Philly's Adoptions Programs. If the foster has not listed a personal email, contact adopt@acctphilly.org to be put in touch with the foster.We encourage you to visit our shelter during our adoption hours to view our complete selection of available animals. In preparation for your visit, please make sure to visit http://www.acctphilly.org/adopt/ to review our adoption requirements, hours of operation, upcoming events, and more!Is this your missing pet?

Noble gets nervous with younger kids or kids that are excitable and becomes fearful. \nGood with other Dogs: Yes\n\nNoble is a good boy. He is shy at first, and needs someone that is patient and has a gentle demeanor. He warms up quickly after meeting you, and fast becomes very, very playful! He love toys of all varieties, but really goes for the squeaky ones and the ropes that he can haul on. He is good with being in his crate for periods of time; he thinks of it as his safe spot and refuge. He is a playful boy whose ears flap in the breeze when he gets very excited. He bounces like a big puppy - which isn't far off. He's a youngin'! He is protective of his food, which is something we are working on with him while he is under our care. His favorite thing in the world is to play tennis ball, endlessly if possible. Noble was taunted and teased mercilessly by children in his past life, so he is not a fan of them now. He travels well in the front seats of cars. He is confident, a clown, and very intelligent.\n----\nPeach County Animal Rescue is a rescue located in Fort Valley, GA. Our adoption fees range from $250-350+. Although our rescue dogs share a common bond with one another, no rescue story is the same (even when similar). Vetting costs vary depending on their health conditions. All of our dogs are fully vetted: up-to-date on annual shots, spayed/neutered and microchipped with a lifetime registration. We look forward to hearing from you!\n\nIf you would like to send in an application for this dog, please use the link below! https://peachcountyanimalrescueandrehabilitation.org/apply-now-2/",

I\u2019m a little nervous around young children, so I would do best with teens and adults. I thrive in a quiet home. If you can\u2019t find me, check my kennel where I go to sleep with my favorite \u201cblankie\u201d and toys! I would love to be a part of a family. Can I come home with you?\n\nYou can complete an adoption application on our website at:  \n     www.onceuponatailrescue.com\nor\n     Scroll down on this page & click \"More About Us\", & then click \"Adoption            Application\" underneath our bright Pink logo. \n\nIf you want to meet a pup in person, Once Upon a Tail Rescue does adoption events at PetSmart in Covington, LA on most Saturdays with many of our adoptable dogs there. \n\nDon't forget to complete your application ahead of time, so you don't miss out on the pup you've connected with.  If pre-approved, you have first priority & can usually take home your new best friend the same day!  \n\n*Please note that there is no obligation to adopt by completing an application.*\n\n**All dogs are required to be fully vetted. Shots, rabies, spay/nueter and microchip.  This is all covered in Adoption fee. Some may still need vetting done due to age, size, breed and health. All vetting will be done by rescues vet clinic.",

In true Scarlett O\u2019Hara fashion, she doesn\u2019t share well with the ladies, but she is wonderful with the boys.   So, this lady needs to be the only female in her forever home.  She was rescued from a shelter, facing certain death.  But, now she is thriving and ready to become a part of your family!\n\n\nYou can complete an adoption application on our website at:  \n     www.onceuponatailrescue.com\nor\n     Scroll down on this page & click \"More About Us\", & then click \"Adoption            Application\" underneath our bright Pink logo. \n\nIf you want to meet a pup in person, Once Upon a Tail Rescue does adoption events at PetSmart in Covington, LA on most Saturdays with many of our adoptable dogs there. \n\nDon't forget to complete your application ahead of time, so you don't miss out on the pup you've connected with.  If pre-approved, you have first priority & can usually take home your new best friend the same day!  \n\n*Please note that there is no obligation to adopt by completing an application.*\n\n**All dogs are required to be fully vetted. Shots, rabies, spay/nueter and microchip.  This is all covered in Adoption fee. Some may still need vetting done due to age, size, breed and health. All vetting will be done by rescues vet clinic.\n",

It's been 9 months and these cutie pies are available for adoption.\n\nMr Jones is the most snuggly, he loves to collect toys and keep them in his bed. He is not food or toy aggressive. He absolutely loves to go for walks on leash (he's quite proud of what an awesome little walker he is) and loves to run around in the yard. Mr Jones has yet to meet a garden hose or sprinkler that he isn't instant friends with. He can really jump when trying to get that water!\n\nHe prefers a soft spoken person as loud voices still make him a little worried. He comes up to visitors and volunteers for pets and cookies now.\n\nIf you'd like to meet Mr Jones, come on down to our adoption center. Thursday - Saturday 11 - 4. 1/19/21 5:53 PM",

With no owners to pick him up any longer we were contacted to give this boy the chance he needs to find a home that will love him always and never abandon him again. Otis is 3 years old, is house trained and walks well on a leash. He is also good with other dogs but cats are unknown at this point. The staff at the kennel love him and say that he is a calm and loving guy who loves to spend time with his people getting scratches. Otis' foster family will be getting to know him better, see what skills he has and what ones he might need help with. Once we learn about about him we can update his bio.\n\nTo see the most up to date adoption status of this dog, please visit www.bigdogshugepaws.com\nThis is just one of hundreds of gentle giants available for adoption at BDHPI!

Purebred puppies are only eligible for adoption to giant breed experienced homes.",

We are looking for a very special adopter for this guy. He was not well cared for in his previous home and when he was surrendered to a local shelter, he quickly ended up on the euthanasia list. His coat looked horrible and he was missing a ton of hair from being severely infested with fleas. As a result of his poor treatment previously, he has some quirks that make it hard to find the right family for him. In addition to the regular obstacles he will have to overcome being A.) a pitbull and B.) dealing with BBD syndrome (big black dog syndrome) he also needs to find a home with no young children and it would be preferred if there are no other dogs. He gets along well with all the other dogs in his foster home but he doesn\u2019t care to be around them. An older calm dog might work okay. He gets anxiety when leaving the house and insists on being able to to see his human at all times. He is sensitive and he\u2019s not a fan of going to the vet. Hercules is a very loyal dog and will attach himself heavily to one or two people. This dog is for the home bodies. The introverts. The Netflix bingers. He wants a best friend to hang out with and to invest all of his love and energy into forever.\n\nWe know his perfect family is out there somewhere, and we also know it will be difficult to find them. So please share Hercules post. The more people that see him the greater his chances of finding his new person. \n\n",

He is about 4 years old & he's an eager to please boy who loves to play with toys! His favorite thing to do is dig into our toy bucket and pick out toys to play with.\n\nSampson is very intelligent and has been through a board-and-train program! Sampson is a bit insecure about himself, so he needs a confident owner who can make sure he will thrive. He has done well with everyone he has met here. The kennel is super stressful for him, he just cries and gets himself worked up all day because he is used to being in a home environment. :(\n\nSampson bonds strongly with his owners. He has a protective nature to him because he is so loyal, he would just need to be put away when guests come over and he doesn't mind it!\n\nIf you are interested in Sampson, fill out an application and be sure to mention his name SAMPSON (SPERRY LONESTAR)!!!",

You see, when I love, I love completely but I need some time to get to know you. Can you give me some of your time? I promise to make it worth your while.\n\nI live at EHR's kennel but one day a week my best friend brings me to his house to hang with him and his family. Those are the best days because I get to run & run & just stretch out my long legs. It just feels so good. And I have a canine buddy who runs & plays with me, too, along with a couple of teenaged boys. I mean, those are the happiest hours of my week. And they've helped me learn good house manners so when you find me - and I sure hope you do - you will be impressed by what a good dog I am.\n\nI'm housetrained and I don't jump up on the furniture - I've even completed a dog obedience class. I have lots of energy and I love to play with toys. I'm a good listener and I'm eager to please - all I want to do is make you happy. I've worked hard to become the dog I am today with a lot of help from my friends.\n\nI hope you'll give me the chance to prove that I'm the right dog for you. Go to www.ehrdogs.org and fill out an application to adopt (or to foster if you'd just like to take things slow with me) and be sure to mention my name - LEON! I'll be waiting at the kennel, patiently, hopefully, for you to find me & bring me home.",

He is good with dogs but needs to learn some manners while playing with them. He is a little sensitive to being petted at first but once you form that bond with him he just loves to cuddle (watch out he snores and hogs the bed!). He would do best in a quiet home with DOG SAVVY adults with minimal visitors (or be willing to put him away when having visitors which he doesn't mind). Please give this boy a chance and let him live his senior years in a home.",

            "description": "Hogan is a super sweet boy and a favorite of our staff and volunteers!! He seems to greet his human friends with a smile and they can't help but smile back when they see that happy face. Hogan is a Black Lab mix around 4 years old that weighs about 45 lbs. He was found in an animal shelter in the rural mountains of Georgia, a place where dogs sat in a windowless room all day, every day, with little human interaction or the feel of real grass beneath their paws. A rescue person saw a photo of Hogan, went to meet him there, and decided this boy needed out of there. He was put on a transport bound for 11th Hour Rescue - he was free at last from his sad existence!\n\nLet me tell you a bit about Hogan - this boy's very favorite thing to do is PLAY! Perhaps that's because he came from a place where he sat alone in a run with nothing to do all day. :( But whether it be Fetch or tug of war, Hogan loves his toys! He's also been to Agility Class with a volunteer friend and he did great on the course! He'll even swim when given the chance! Hogan is a smart boy and knows some basic commands like sit, stay, drop and down. He is housebroken, crate trained, and good with most dogs.\n\nUnfortunately, after being adopted for 8 months, Hogan was recently returned to 11th Hour because he became very protective of his home. We feel that Hogan needs a strong owner who has experience with protective/territorial dogs. Although he was very loving with his family (which included a 13 year old), we feel that Hogan would do best in a home with no children because of his protectiveness. Hogan gets along with most dogs and attended doggie daycare in the past.\n\nIf you'd like to meet Hogan for yourself, just fill out a dog adoption application at www.ehrdogs.org and be sure to mention his name - Hogan SCAS! This boy would really like to be back in a home of his own again with people who love him.",

This little munchkin has a 100 watt smile that can light up a room and brighten your day. Despite having lost her home due to serious illness a while back, she is upbeat and entertaining and a joy to be around.\n\nDiamond loves to explore and it's comical to watch her.whether she's surveying the play yards, or investigating a pile of blankets on the floor. She also loves car rides and walks with her best volunteer pals. But right at the top of her list of favorite things, is getting loved on by her people! If you talk to her and pet her, she will look into your eyes and hang onto your every word. She's such a special little girl.\n\nDiamond has waited far too long for a home to replace the one she lost. She has so much love to give and we want someone to love her in return. She's a nice tidy size, around 35 lbs. and she knows some basic commands. She needs to be the only dog in the house, so if you're looking for one special friend, she may be perfect for you!\n\nPlease give Diamond her second chance at finding a home and family. You can fill out an adoption or foster application at www.ehrdogs.org and mention her name.DIAMOND BEAUFORT!!",

            "description": "Freddy came from the basement of a vacant house in Paterson and he was scared and unsure of people when he first arrived to 11th Hour, which made it hard for him to trust. He has come a long way though! After Freddy has met you and knows you don't want to hurt him, you've become a friend to him for life. The ONLY time Freddy has ever made a peep is when he lets out some squeals of excitement when he sees his favorite friends coming to his kennel run. Once he's happily with his humans, Freddy is polite and quiet - content to just enjoy good company. Freddy is a simple man, he enjoys milk-bones meant for tiny puppies, rope toys that have squeaky stuffed animals on them, and is happiest when he's able to roll around on a comfy blanket in the backseat of your car. He's the perfect car companion, always up to take a few selfies, stop for a burger, or even just take a long nap while you enjoy a peaceful sunny day. Freddy loves to cuddle, and will take a seat right on your lap! He doesn't quite realize how muscular he is, so he would do best in a home without children both because we don't want him to knock any small humans over and because he would really thrive in a quieter environment. An ideal family for Freddy would let him be an only child, both human and animal wise, and would preferably be an adult couple, or single person looking for a canine companion. He really enjoys long walks in the park, short walks in the yard, or just some lazy couch-potato style bonding - so no matter your lifestyle, Freddy is happy just to spend time with you.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Freddy please fill out the adoption application for Eleventh Hour Rescue.",

            "description": "Atlas Maverick was adopted from us when he was only 2 months old, but was returned after less than a year in the home because they didn't have the time to train or play with him, and the poor pup was spending more and more time crated. Toward the end of his time there, we don't think he was cared for well at all.\n\nMaverick, as his kennel friends call him, was very scared when he found himself back with EHR. Our staff and volunteers have been working with him, but it is not the same as being in a home. He needs slow introductions to people, because he lost his trust in his humans at such a young age. This boy would need a quiet, adult only house where he can learn to relax. He needs someone who will take it slow and build his trust again. He has not had good experiences with cats or small dogs, but having another canine companion who is well balanced and can be a good influence will help give Maverick the confidence he needs. He must be in a home with another dog.\n\nMaverick is house & crate trained, plus he walks well on a leash. With his friends, he is a young boy who loves to play with toys & a game of \"Fetch\" if you're up for it. He is smart & knows basic commands. He would do best in a home with people who are active & have dog experience.\n\nCan you be the one to give this big guy the place he needs to feel loved and protected? Give him a chance to show you what kind of dog he can be with the right kind of owner! Please fill out an application today at www.ehrdogs.org & be sure to ask for him by name, ATLAS MAVERICK SCAS!",

            "description": "From Shelby's kennel buddy: Shelby was adopted as a puppy and recently returned after 2 years in her home. The owners say they returned her because of her anxiety and because she chews. That being said, Shelby is a sweet girl who is a bit shy at first but loves people. I have seen her come out of her shell a little more and more with new people since being returned.\n\nShelby is okay on the leash but could use a little work but all in all she's not a big puller at all.\nShe LOVES to play fetch with her ball and will bring it back to you (we are working on the dropping of the ball). With other dogs I have seen her be a little hit or miss. She's mostly fine when walking by and with her growing confidence she seems to be doing better and better. As with a lot of the dogs, slow intros work best with her, and an overly rambunctious dog will spark her ire. Calm dogs work better at least for now.\n\nShelby did live with children in her previous home and did well, but calmer, respectful kids would be best since she is nervous.\n\nShelby deserves a second chance to find someone to love her & help her be the dog we know she can be. If that person might be you, please fill out an application to adopt her or, if adoption isn't possible, to foster her - please mention her name! She is really struggling at the kennel after having been in a home of her own for 2 years.",

He is 8 years old and requires a strong handler to help him become confident again. Marshall is loving and sweet but will do best in a quiet home without a lot of visitors. He does get along with both dogs and cats - he is even okay with children but might do best in an adults-only home where there will be fewer comings and goings.\n\nIf you have the right kind of environment for Marshall, please consider giving him a one-way ticket out of the EHR kennel.

He will require more than one meeting before being able to go home. If there are children in the home, they should be AT LEAST in their UPPER TEENS. Geewhiz is up to date on vaccinations and has been microchipped. He is ready for his new home - all he needs is for you to say the word!\n\nIf you're interested in meeting Geewhiz, go to EHRDOGS.ORG and submit an application.

Jackson would be the most wonderful addition to any home without children and with people who take charge! You see, Mr. Browne can sometimes be over protective of his family, especially children. He guards the house and his people that he loves so he needs some direction and a strong leader. That being said, he has a personality unlike any other pup. He's sweet, playful, silly, loving, and knows when to RELAX!! He's a great cuddler and will curl up next to you, even in the smallest of spaces. He loves his belly rubs, so be prepared when he stretches out his paws to you!\n\nJackson also loves to go on walks and adventures and ESPECIALLY loves the water!! He pulls slightly on the leash, but he is great in the car. Once Jackson meets you, he LOVES you, but it does take time. He is generally good with meeting dogs and people outside on the leash, but sometimes he gets nervous so make sure to properly introduce him first! Again, Jackson is friendly with most dogs, but can be dog selective.\n\nJackson is housetrained, knows basic commands, and listens very well. Jackson can be trained easily. He is the most lovable, most precious dog and he will love you completely.\n\nIf you'd like to meet Jackson, please fill out an application today, he's sure to put a smile on your face! 2/2/21 5:36 PM",

            "description": "Max is a big mush of a dog that enjoys the attention of people and smiles from ear to ear when you talk to him. He loves going for a ride in the car and makes the best co-pilot, ever!! Max the Mush has been at the kennel for almost 8 years on and off! It is truly heartbreaking. Max is soo loving and loyal!! He is great in the car, loves walks, his toys, and is food motivated!\n\nMax is approximately 11.5 years old, but he acts much younger. The high stress environment of the kennel is no place for him to live out the rest of his life. He has not had very many opportunities to interact with other dogs so he would do best in a single pet house unless we could find the perfect match of a doggie sibling. Max has met a volunteer's dog and did well with her; even showing signs of wanting to play. However, he has never lived with one, so that might be too stressful of a change for him. He has not reacted well to cats, so we are firm with the no felines rule.\n\nThe ideal home for Max would be quiet without many visitors. He would do best with older, respectful kids as he gives big, rough kisses that may startle or knock over a younger child. Max would also need someone who is willing to take it slowly with him and willing to meet him several times before bringing him home. He is such a gem that continuously gets overlooked. He has so much love to give, we promise you will not need anything else if you have Max. He always has the biggest smile on his face, too. Please consider Max!\n\nIf you're willing to take a chance on Max, you will be rewarded with a loyal & trusting friend. Please consider giving Max a home to live out his golden years!\n\nMax won the heart of a family and they have very kindly sponsored Max's adoption fee!!!",

            "description": "When Nancy was diagnosed with glaucoma, she required surgery to remove both eyes. :( Considering she has no sight, she does remarkably well in her special foster home, but EHR would love for her to be in an adults-only foster (or forever) home where her condition could be best managed. She can be a little picky about her doggie friends, but is okay with some dogs. EHR's wish is that someone would take Nancy into their home as foster or forever pup & let her live out the rest of her days knowing love and security with people she trusts.\n\nNancy is a scruffy little girl with great big ears and a thirst for adventure! She is super easy on leash and loves going for walks and exploring the great outdoors. She also loves playing with her toys. Nancy takes treats gently and knows some basic commands. But like many terriers, she has a strong personality and would do best with an experienced owner.\n\nHere's what one of her kennel buddies said about Nancy: She got in and rode extremely well in the car. On the walk itself, she was initially so excited to be out that she pulled in different directions, but because she is so light it was very easy to manage. She settled down quickly, however, and was great on the leash for the rest of the walk. She loves to stop and smell everything like a typical terrier but kept the pace and walked well.\n\nA special girl like Nancy requires a special kind of adopter. If you feel that you could be that special person who could foster or adopt Nancy, please fill out an application at www.ehrdogs.org and be sure to mention her name.NANCY STEELE!!",

            "description": "Bosco dreams of the day he can leave kennel life behind for good. Sure, he's got some great \"kennel buddies\" who take him for walks or a dip in the lake. And lying on his bed chewing on an antler helps pass the hours in his kennel run. But that's not the same as having a REAL home.\n\nBosco previously lived in an apartment complex with a couple who adored him. They said he was a quiet, low key guy who just enjoyed being around them. But Bosco didn't do well with other dogs he met in and around the apartment building & he was returned to us. As a result, we think Bosco would do best in a single family, adult-only home (as the only pet) since he does prefer a quiet lifestyle. A fenced-in yard would be ideal so that Bosco could spend time hanging out on his own property with perhaps a deck for just lying in the sun, something he loves to do.\n\nIf you take a chance on Bosco & give him your love, he will return that love many times over - he will be your loyal BFF for all his life. This big scruffy pup is very good on leash and makes a great walking partner. He is well mannered and patient, and knows when he needs to wait quietly at your side. He does well in the car, too, though he does have a tendency to try to wiggle his way into the front seat rather than ride in the back. We usually compromise and he stands somewhere in the middle and leans into me which is fine 'cause he loves his people and is so happy when he gets the chance to get away from the kennel for a while. He's even happier if he happens to come across a pond or a lake while he's out because he enjoys a dip in the water any time of year!\n\nBosco has been back with us for several years now and it's a shame because he is a good boy that really deserves another chance at a home and family. In the meantime, he is loved dearly by his human friends at the kennel. In addition, Bosco takes treats gently, knows some basic commands and loves chewing on elk antlers (check out the video). And he was so well housebroken when he came back to us that he hated to mess his outside run!\n\nDo you have the right situation for this boy & want to make Bosco's dream of freedom and a REAL home come true? If having one special dog in your life is enough for you, please consider Bosco and fill out a dog adoption application at www.ehrdogs.org\n\nIf you can't adopt right now but would like to give Bosco a break from kennel life (he's been back with us 4 long years), please consider fostering him.",

            "description": "Kale originally came to EHR as a puppy back in 2013 with his sibling Kandy. He was quickly adopted and renamed Max. 6 years later, this boy was returned to EHR through no fault of his own.\n\nMax is a big man that loves to run around his yard, play fetch with his unstuffed toys, and sunbathe. After a long day running around, he loves to cuddle up on the couch with his family.\n\nHe's best suited for a family with older children and a fenced-in yard. He does not do well with other animals, and must be kept separate from other dogs. When he meets new people, he gets so excited, will jump on them and give lots of kisses. Max is housebroken, not destructive, and is calm and relaxed in the home. He is cuddly and loves belly rubs. He knows some simple commands, including sit and paw. Max is good on a leash, but does get excited if he sees other animals. He needs to be walked on a harness.\n\nIf you would like to meet this boy, please fill out a Dog Adoption Application at www.ehrdogs.org & be sure to ask for MAX (KALE) SCAS! He sure would love to be in a home again!",

I'm a bit timid at first, but once I get to know you I'm a real sweetheart! I have come SUCH a long way with the help of my volunteer friends. I meet new people well now when introduced by my best friends (ESPECIALLY if they have snacks!) but I would like a more low traffic house hold. My favorite thing to do is take nice long hikes with my people and I absolutely LOVE car rides. I'm a wonderful companion to someone who understands I want to be pet on my own terms (I enjoy affection, I just prefer it to be when I want it.) I would rather not be kissed on the face or hugged for too long. I would do best in a home without other pets or small children. If you are experienced with dogs and want a happy, fun loving best friend, I'm the pooch for you!",

She has spent the last year in a foster home learning what it's like to be a loved member of a family. She must have a secure fenced in yard, another dog or dogs that she can bond with, and only older responsible children. Hannah loves dogs and all people once she warms up. She is super loving, goofy and playful. Hannah is still a flight risk though and can get nervous, so a family that is willing to work with her and give her time to settle will be a must, and she will love you forever! She is housebroken, spayed, microchipped, and up to date on shots. Any interested families will need a home check prior to adopting.\n\nIf Hannah might be the one for you go to EHRDOGS.ORG and submit an application. Don't forget to ask for HANNAH STEELE!!!",

Since coming to EHR I have met many wonderful people. My foster who takes me home says I am housebroken, know all my basic commands (and a few bonus extras)\n\nUPDATE FROM CURRENT HOME:\n\nIn the time we have had him Petey has improved his understanding of basic commands (sit, stay, down) as well as learned some new ones. We have been working on \"Leave it\" and \"Drop it\" and he has been responding well. We also are able to get him to wait for his food until we give the \"OK\" and are able to stop him eating with \"leave it.\" We have not noticed any type of food aggression with him, he takes treats very nicely and won't take a treat until we say \"OK\".\n\nPetey is very good in the crate. When we first got him we tried to leave him in the house all day and he had an accident on the carpet EVERY day. We tried baby gates and barriers and he always jumped them. We figured it was a separation anxiety reaction from him. Since we started using the crate he has not had one accident and comes and goes from it on his own when the door is open. It definitely keeps him calm when we are out of the house. We do have him sleep in it at night as well, but he of course would love to just be in bed with us all night if he could. He is such a snuggler, still very affectionate and just wanting to be by us all the time.\n\nWe definitely feel like he needs to be an only dog in a family with no children and who wouldn't have him interact with small animals or children. He definitely needs a lot of attention and love. We think he would love to run around and play in a high fenced yard.\nHe also now responds to the name Dexter.",

She is a smart girl who would do well with strong handlers and with older and more considerate kids. This sweet girl is house trained, does well with other dogs, loves to run and \"hike\". She lacks the confidence she needs to thrive in a home on her own, so we believe she needs a home with another dog! Serena does the cutest spins and whines when she sees her favorite people at the kennel\n\nIf you would like to meet with Serena, be sure to visit our website, EHRDOGS.ORG, and submit an application. Don't forget to mention her name, Whiskey (Serena Barnwell)!!",

            "description": "Mirage is an energetic little fellow who loves exploring the outdoors, taking walks and even swimming when given the chance. Basically, anything that affords him the chance to be outside works for him! He is a Australian Cattle dog/Blue Heeler mix, and true to his breed, Mirage is a dog that needs to keep busy in order to be at his best. He is sweet and affectionate, but needs a good amount of exercise before settling in to rest. We'd love to see him have a fenced yard so he can get an adequate amount of outdoor time. He loves to play fetch, or run and play with soccer balls that are nearly as big as he is!!\n\nMirage was picked up as a stray by a rural animal control. He sat in a crate at the facility for weeks before he was rescued and fully vetted for his trip to 11th Hour. Perhaps that's why he's not a fan of confinement and would do best in a home where his people are around most of the time. He's an absolutely gorgeous dog, but would do best with a strong handler who understands the breed.\n\nMirage is great in the car, decent on leash and knows some basic commands, but hasn't had much one on one training. He can be reactive around dogs so we think he may be best as the only dog in the house. He is a favorite of our staff and volunteers alike, so if you have the time to give, and are in need of an awesome little buddy, please consider Mirage! Please fill out a Dog Adoption Application at www.ehrdogs.org on this great boy today & be sure to ask for him by name - MIRAGE SCAS.",

            "description": "Meet Topaz! This beautiful Carolina Dog mix has the biggest, cutest, pointy ears. She has a great personality and loves everyone. She would love an owner who is very active and will keep her moving. Because she was a stray for so long and did not have consistent training when she was young, Topaz still has some of her puppy tendencies, such as mouthy play and jumping up. However, she is such a smart girl and so eager to please so with some firm training, these behaviors can be quickly corrected with an experienced owner. Because of this, though, we would not suggest her for families with young children.\n\nTopaz is always up for an adventure and LOVES riding in the car, with her head out the window. She also enjoys learning agility training techniques, such as jumps and tunnels. After her exercise, she likes nothing more than to relax on a soft bed and get belly rubs.\n\nTopaz can be dog selective, so she would need the right match for her to live with another dog but we believe it is possible! Topaz requires a 6 ft wood or vinyl fenced in yard (she can climb chain link) - this is due to her high energy level but more importantly because even after a long walk, she prefers to due her business privately, off leash and away from her people. A generous donor has covered part of her adoption fee! Topaz is spayed, up to date on vaccines and microchipped.\n\nTo meet Topaz, please fill out an application at www.ehrdogs.org.",

Lucky is a 4 year old Labrador Retriever/Cattle dog mix who was surrendered to a kill shelter because the kids were no longer interested in him and the mother didn't want to pay for someone to watch the dog when they went on vacation!!!\n\nLucky is amazingly affectionate, eager to please and housebroken. He bonds quickly with his owner and is protective of his both his home and owner, he would make a great watchdog in a quiet household. Should go to home with an experienced, adult dog owner and he must be the only dog in the house. Lucky is very energetic and playful, he should get daily exercise, a fenced in yard would be ideal.\n\n11th Hour Rescue now wants to give this sweet, loving boy the chance to find a family who will love him, appreciate him, and treat him like one of the family.

            "description": "Petey came to EHR along with his brother Wagner when they were puppies. Both were adopted but now Petey has been returned to EHR's care. Being back at the kennel has been very stressful for Petey, but he has some great volunteer friends who have nothing but good things to say about him. He has lost his confidence and can be nervous with new places & things, but gives you unconditional love once he trusts. He looks to his people for direction and confidence, so he would benefit from experienced owners who can help him with this. He has gone through obedience training and is a fun loving boy. He absolutely loves going for car rides, too! Petey gets along with other dogs, but we think he would do best in a home without children right now. Can you help Petey get his second chance at finding a true forever home? If so, please fill out an application at EHRDOGS.ORG and be sure to ask for him by name! You will not be sorry you did!",

He is very well-trained, including OFF-LEASH trained. Stanley's professional training comes with lifetime follow-ups if needed.\n\nStanley loves going for rides in the car if you'd like company. Stanley would do best with an owner that will provide him with structure to which he has become accustomed. He loves the outdoors and is excellent on-leash. When it comes to other dogs, he seems to prefer female over male dogs. Stanley is up to date on vaccinations, neutered, and microchipped.\n\nIf you're interested in meeting Stanley, go to EHRDOGS.ORG and submit an application.
