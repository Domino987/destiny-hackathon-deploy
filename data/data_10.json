If interested in adoption Sumner, please submit an application at socorescue.com. (no phone calls please.)***\n\nSumner is a 3 month old Lab/Bulldog mix who came to our rescue as an owner surrender along with his siblings. They previously lived in filth, weren't given proper care and most likely would have perished if they hadn't been rescued. Sumner simply loves life! He's very playful and friendly, loves to snuggle and is excellent with other pups. He will make a great addition into just about any home..\n\nSumner is up to date on his first year vaccinations, has been de-wormed, treated against parasites and started on his monthly preventatives. Sumner's' adopter must agree to having him neuter once he reaches 6 months of age and provide proof of such to our rescue. He will need all of his basic training.",

He\u2019s amazing with all other dogs, even the cranky ones. If a dog snipes at him, he just looks away and doesn\u2019t want to engage. He\u2019s shown curious interest in cats encountered on walks but hasn\u2019t tried to chase them.\n\nSam is house trained and quickly learned to use a dog door. He settles calmly in a crate, but he does want to be able to sleep in the bedroom with you at night and not be alone. He\u2019s fine being left home alone and hasn\u2019t tried to chew on or mess with anything in his foster home. He can get a little excited when you come home and may try to jump, but he\u2019s working on learning to sit down instead. He walks easily on a leash and is learning to walk next to his person instead of going ahead, but he never pulls. He\u2019s very sensitive to leash pressure so he should only have a martingale or flat collar. He loves to be able to hang out in a yard, but always needs to have a way back in so he knows he hasn\u2019t been shut out from the family he so wants to be part of.\n\nSam is a really special boy who just wants a family who will snuggle with him, take him on fun walks, and let him be where they are. He will shower you with so much love in return.",

I need a owner who is familiar with my breed and knows my requirements! I will need positive obedience training! I love attention! I would be best in a home with no cats because I am very curious with them and like to bark! I get along with other dogs, but I really just walked around and kept to myself. The staff recommends that I be crated when I am at home by myself to keep me safe! I will need to see my new veterinarian within two weeks of my adoption to ensure that I stay healthy and keep on a regular vaccination schedule. My adoption fee is $150 which helps cover the cost of my care. If you are interested in adopting me or another homeless pet at Macomb County Animal Control, please complete an application at the link below and an adoption counselor will be in contact with you. https://animalcontrol.macombgov.org/AnimalControl-AdoptionApplication",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Sparky! I am about 8 months old, and I am a beagle mix! I weigh about 23lb. I am a very sweet, quiet and handsome young man! I will need someone who can help me work on my socialization and obedience training! The staff has been working with me on my housbreaking skills and I'm pretty good at it, but I would benefit from more training! I would probably do well with small kids as long as we are supervised, but I would love to meet them first! I seem to get along really well with other dogs! The staff would recommend that I be crated when I am home by myself, to keep me safe! I am up to date on my vaccines, but I will need to see my new veterinarian within 2 weeks of my adoption to ensure that I stay healthy and keep on a regular vaccination schedule! My adoption fee is $275, which helps cover the cost for my care! If you're interested in adopting me or another homeless pet at Macomb County Animal Control, please complete an application at the link below and an adoption counselor will be in contact with you. https://animalcontrol.macombgov.org/AnimalControl-AdoptionApplication",

            "description": "Kubo_A189721 Kubo is a 4-year-old, neutered male, red Akita/Husky mix that weighs 74 pounds. He was brought in by his previous owner because he killed a few chickens that were roaming free in his area. Kubo lived with his former owner for two years and he was really sad to let him go. He said he is a good dog, and we have to agree! Kubo spent his time with his previous owner going to work with him every day. At night, he would sleep in a kennel outside. Kubo was an outside dog, but is super-smart and would catch on to house training fast. Kubo has never lived with children and his only fear is when someone yells at him. Kubo previously lived with horses and another dog and did well with them. We found Kubo to be a very nice dog. He is friendly toward all adults that he meets. Because he has never lived with children and doesn't like yelling, he would not be a candidate for a home with younger children. He would do best with older, dog-savvy children. Kubo walks very well on the leash and knows heel. Kubo would do best in a home that does not have cats. He is friendly toward the larger dogs here at the shelter. If you have another larger dog and are interested in adopting Kubo, please call us at 801-399-8244 to make an appointment for a meet and greet. If you are unfamiliar with the Akita and Husky breeds, we highly recommend to research the breeds first if you are considering adding Kubo as a family member. Kubo's $89 to adoption fee includes his DAPP and rabies vaccines, microchip, leash, collar and goody bag.",

She is 1 of 7 siblings surrendered to the shelter, so they all came to Illinois to find a forever home. Though from Arkansas she loves the snow and her toys. She is an energetic puppy who adores attention and a lot of love to give. She does great with everyone, kids and other dogs. She is learning basic puppy manners, crate training and potty training all of which are going well. She will need someone home (not left alone more then a few hours) to continue with these basics and socialization. She will make a wonderful addition to any home. \n\nWE DO NOT DO OUT OF STATE ADOPTIONS\nThank you for considering the adoption of one of our rescue dogs.  We are committed to finding our rescues the perfect home. Together we can make a difference in the life of a dog.\n \nThe adoption process should be a fun and exciting time for families and dogs. Our goal is to place our babies in forever homes.  The potential adopter needs to be dedicated to their care and training for life. \nUnderstand that sharing your life with a dog can be a commitment of 15+ years. This would include feeding, exercise, training, vetting, and providing a loving home. Ask yourself, \"Am I ready for this type of commitment?\"  If you are ready, we are here to help.  We do have some requirements to help us find the perfect placement of our babies. \n\nWE ARE A FOSTER BASED RESCUE ONLY. WE DO NOT HAVE A PHYSICAL BUILDING\n1.

Only a final approval for adoption can take place after a successful meet and greet. This is done by appointments only. We will not proceed with the adoption if everyone has not met the dog.  This will allow others the opportunity to adopt the dog.\n2.  Adopters MUST be 21 years old.\nInformation on all adults/members living in the home is required\nWe REQUIRE you to provide proof and vet reference that all current and past pets have been kept up to date on all routine medical.\n3.  Illinois law requires that all of our dogs and puppies be spayed/neutered within 30 days of adoption. In order to fully comply with this regulation and reduce the number of homeless dogs and puppies, \n4.  If you do not own your home, you must provide landlord contact information on the application and a copy of your lease that outlines the rules for dog ownership in your residence.  \nLarge breed dogs will not be adopted into apartment settings or where there are breed/ size restrictions.\nPuppies have special needs and require a home where someone is available to care for, socialize, and give basic training.  If you are gone for more than a couple hours at a time, please consider adopting a teen or older dog.\n5.  Adoption fees are $350. We accept checks or cash. (Prices are subject to change without notice).\n6.  All dogs and puppies adopted through Forever Home are fully vetted with age appropriate vaccines. Keep in mind once you take possession of your newly adopted dog, any and all future medical costs or care is YOUR responsibility.\n7. First time puppy/dog adopters will be required to sign up for and pay in advance a basic training class. A deposit of an extra 50.00 will be required until a class has been completed, it will then be returned. \n8.

            "description": "It's rare in rescue to find a perfect dog who is already very well trained. Zeus is one of these one in a million dogs! Zeus had been very well trained and taken care of for his whole life. Zeus is potty trained, leash trained, and basic command trained. He is very well mannered, calm, and great with all people and all dogs. Zeus was actually a board and train graduate! Zeus is 7 years old, so he's not a crazy puppy anymore. Zeus enjoys the perks of being an adult dog. He chooses to relax, instead of jump and play. To snooze, instead of howl at the front window. To cuddle, instead of wrestle. But his owners weren't ready for that stage of Zeus's life to end. So they did what any family does, and got a puppy. Zeus was super tolerant with the puppy climbing on him and biting him with their sharp puppy teeth. However, one day his owners of 7 years decided that caring for 2 dogs was too much extra work, and they brought sweet Zeus to the shelter.... I truly will never understand. That day, his mom and dad made a choice. His humans stood and looked their family pet in the eyes and said, \"You are the one I do not want.\" \n\nOur Texas rescue parters have gotten Zeus out of the shetler and into a foster home. Zeus is now coming to Colorado to find a home who would never ever abandon this sweet, smart, well trained boy. Zeus is likely a Lab/Cattle Dog mix, according to the Texas vets. However, breed is just a guess, and he likely has multiple breeds in him! Zeus is 7 years old, and 65 lbs. He isn't huge, but thick. He is truly a gentle giant.\n\nWith any rescue, moving from a shelter to a foster to an adoptive home can be very confusing. When an adopting family is sensitive to the challenges of change and acclimation for these dog's, the transition is far easier. A home with a very loving and nurturing family that understands that blossoming takes time would be perfect home for Apollo. Socialization, pure love and belly rubs is a gift to a dog that is undergoing a life change. Given the time and space, these dogs shine. \n\nFarfel's Rescue has found over time (we've rescued more than 3,000 dogs over 15 years of rescue) that families that attend level 1 group training classes or address individual challenges at home with one of our approved positive reinforcement/force free trainers keep their dogs for life. Dogs that do not get proper training and socialization have a much higher risk of developing behavioral problems. There is a bonding that occurs through the training process that can't be duplicated. It also teaches behaviors that enable a dog to go out into the world with excellent manners that create a very respectful relationship between dogs and their humans. It is for all these reasons that Farfel's isn't willing to adopt to a family that doesn't choose to create this training relationship. Farfel's is happy to provide a list of approved positive reinforcement/ force-free trainers in your area. \n\nZeus is up to date on his vaccines and neutered!\n\nZeus is arriving on transport in Boulder on 2/10/2021. Applications are currently being accepted for our wonderful pup. If interested in this gorgeous, very cuddly/sweet and loving best friend, please fill out an application completely at http://farfels.com/farfels-rescue/adoption-form/ and submit.\n\n**PLEASE NOTE** If you're truly interested in adopting from us, please be sure to fill out our Farfel's Rescue adoption application found at the link above or at farfels.com. Adoption site applications such as Petfinder, Rescueme and Adoptapet don't provide enough information and therefore aren't useful. Our Farfel's application is the only initial tool that we have to determine a great match for this very deserving puppy. We're sorry, but in most cases, we're unable to get back to those that don't submit our Farfel's Rescue adoption application. Thanks very much for choosing rescue.\n",

For animals in FOSTER homes, please submit an online application and an adoption team will reply with next steps. We thank you for your patience as we work to keep saving lives during this difficult time. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please fill out our dog adoption questionnaire and e-mail it to lindsay.homewardtrails@gmail.com\n\nPLEASE VISIT THIS WEBSITE TO FIND THE ADOPTION QUESTIONNAIRE:\nhttp://www.homewardtrails.org/adopt-a-pet/adoption-forms/\n\nMeet Boomer! This adorable boy comes to Homeward Trails from Fayette County, WV where he had a rough start to the new year. After being hit by a car, Boomer was left at an emergency vet who confirmed he had a broken pelvis that would need surgery. Our shelter partner reached out, asking if we could help to save Boomer's life. How could we say no? \n\nThis sweet boy had surgery to repair his broken pelvis on Jan 13. He should make a full recovery after 6-8 weeks, and cant wait to find his forever home. His adoption coordinator can fill you in more on his physical therapy and remaining medical care.\n\nA little bit more about Boomer - he is about 30 lbs, and could add a few more pounds to fill out. We think he's about 1.5 yrs old, he's very sweet, and housetrained. He gets along pretty well with cats, and he really likes to play. He is definitely dog-friendly and would love a big active family with another doggie sibling perhaps. That said, since he is still on restricted activity until March, it's important that his new house is relatively quiet and able to help with his physical therapy. Boomer would do best with a mom or dad who is home more often than not, as he doesnt do well being left alone for long periods of time, especially in his crate. \n\nHe is an active boy who loves taking walks and playtime. Once he's done playing, he's already to cuddle up and be a lap dog. \n\nWe'd love to talk to you more if you're interested in meeting Boomer! \n\nAdoption Coordinator: Lindsay\nLocation: Foster Home\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $475. This fee INCLUDES spay/neuter and microchip. \n\nWe are proud to partner with the following veterinarians who offer a free first exam for your animal, exclusively for HT adopters: Caring Hands Animal Hospital, Palisades Veterinary Clinic, Sunshine Animal Hospital and Clarendon Animal Care and all VCA Animal Hospitals.\n\nAdditionally, any VCA hospital will cover illnesses up to $250 at no cost to any Homeward Trails adopter.\n\nWe also provide free online workshop with a professional dog trainer at Fur-Get Me Not within the first 30 days of adopting - just for HT adopters in the Arlington/Alexandria/Falls Church/DC area. Start your new dog out on the right foot with this valuable, expert guidance FREE!\n\nYou can save animals like this one by becoming a foster! Fosters are like way stations between high kill shelters and forever homes. We need fosters so that we can save dogs before they are euthanized at the shelters. If you are interested in becoming a foster, please check out our information about fostering by visiting http://www.homewardtrails.org/foster-a-pet/dog-and-cat-foster-program",

            "description": "Sasha is a complete love and goofball. She loves to play with her foster brother and tries to play with the cat but respects her boundaries. Sasha would do well in a home with another dog to help build her confidence, follow their lead and get her energy out. She loves to chew on her toys especially bones and Kongs filled with soft food. She is working on housebreaking and getting better but needs to learn to go out even if her sibling doesn\u2019t go too as that is when her accidents seem to happen. She is crate trained and learning to master the sit command. She enjoys her walks but when she is done she is done. She prefers to retrace her steps home rather than complete a loop but is more willing when following the lead of her foster sibling. She is good with kids and wants to meet all the other pups she sees. She is also happy to curl up on the couch and snuggle with you. She needs to warm up to people but when given space to do so she is trusting and loving. She would also benefit from an active household as she is very curious and likes to be kept busy. \n\n** WANT MORE INFO OR THINKING OF ADOPTING THIS PET? **\n\nFor a QUICK RESPONSE go to -- WWW.HOPALONG.ORG -- and complete an adoption application. It is not a commitment to adopt, it just begins the process and shows interest in a particular animal. Someone will contact you by phone or email within 2 full business days to interview you or inform you on the status of your application.",

They are very striking dogs, noble, and kind to those they know. They prefer a home with land where they can roam and oversee their domain, however they shouldn't be left to free roam without a fence to keep them on the property. Livestock guardian breeds have a very large roaming range that often expands further than most single farm properties. Many GPs are indifferent to other dogs off their property. Gordo is tolerant of other dogs. He prefers to have the companionship of people. He leans in and nudges for more petting, and would love nothing more than to find a family to cuddle him. Gordo was found stray in rural Ohio. Gordo is currently 91lbs and approximately 3 years old.",

            "description": "Toot is living in a foster home. Submit an application from our website and then make an appointment to meet him.\n\nToot is not eligible for foster and will be a straight adoption.\n\nAge: ~1 year\nWeight: ~46lbs\nHousebroken: Yes\nCrate trained: Working on it! Takes some time to settle (10-30 minutes) and would benefit from continued training for this. Hasn't been left alone very much due to COVID.\nDog sociability: Reported dog friendly, and eager to meet dogs on walks although the foster has not had him interact with others. He gets jumpy/lungey when dogs or people are within 6 ft of him while out on walks and would benefit from continued leash training.\nCat sociability: Unknown\nKids: Unknown\nIdeal home: Toot is a young, active dog looking for an active home! He requires a good amount of daily mental and physical stimulation to be his best self. He will do best in a quiet neighborhood where he can work on his leash training as he can get easily overstimulated outside with passing dogs and humans.\n\nToot is a sweet, playful, energetic little boy who is very curious to sniff everything in sight. He *loves* walks and gets so excited when he knows he's about to go on one-- he wiggles as he wags his tail and gives a soft howl if you're not fast enough to put on your winter gear! After walks he likes to jump/hug you to thank you with kisses. While Toot is a velcro dog who will follow you room to room, he also enjoys his space laying on the floor and will come sit next to you when he's ready for his next round of petting and playing. This little guy also loves his chew toys, so be sure to have plenty on hand. Toot will need a home dedicated to meeting his physical & mental needs since he's energetic, and he would likely love a home with a yard. Toot is working on 'sit' and 'down,' and will play fetch in return for treats. He has responded well so far to beginning leash training, but will need to continue so he pulls less (he's just so excited to sniff the world!). He likes string cheese and peanut butter, but loves sliced hot dog as training treats!\n\nToot's adoption fee is 300. He will be neutered on a future date (3/4/21) and a 50 refundable neuter deposit will be required. He is up to date on core vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative.\n\n***We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications. We ask that you please be patient and someone will be in touch via email within 72 hours. Please do not email us unless you have not received a response in 72 hours. Please only fill out one adoption application. ***",

He plays well with dogs his size and larger and loves running around the yard and wrestling with them. He really enjoys chasing tennis balls! Jasper was with large and small dogs, male and female, and had no problems with any of them - they all got along so well. He's curious about cats -never aggressive with them. Jasper does OK with a leash; he needs more practice to get used to it. He is potty training and minding very well - just need to keep working on it. Jasper likes to snuggle, chew on his bones & toys, and run around the yard. He will make a family very happy and is available for adoption through Eleventh Hour Rescue.\n\nApply to adopt JASPER LONESTAR at EHRdogs.org!",

I'm a 14 year old cocker spaniel and I'm looking for a quiet new place to call home.\n\nI was brought to the shelter by my owners who had some health concerns and were unable to care for me any longer.  So now I'm here hoping that someone like you will come adopt me!\n\nI'm a very good girl, and I love people.  I would also do well in a home with other dogs!  Since I'm 14 I would prefer a home with older dogs, I'm past those wild puppy years!\n\nI know some people may be scared to open their heart to an older girl like me, but I promise you I will be sooooooo much easier to care for than a baby puppy would be!  Instead of chewing your favorite shoes and new furniture, I would be content to nap the day away and cuddle with you on the couch!\n\nIf you're looking for a laid back furry family member and think I might be the girl for you, please stop by the shelter and spend some time getting to know me!",

Because of my past of only being seen as a cash cow, I am a VERY shy boy. I am learning to trust more and more each day. \n\nI require a home with a fenced in yard and another dog.\nI do not leash walk! I need work with potty training!\nNo apartment/condo\nNo children under 13\n\nMy adoption fee is $350, which includes my neuter, shots, heartworm testing, and microchipping. You can find the adoption application and process on our website www.orphanannierescue.org.\n\nYou must live in metro Atlanta to adopt me.",

            "description": "Look at that sweet smile! Apollo was found living on the streets with another dog (who looked like she could be his sister!) They were found huddling together one night when it was raining at an apartment complex that they took shelter in. They found a patio outside of someone's apartment where they cuddled each other and braved the storm together. The person who lived in the apartment saw the two black and white pups huddled together shivering and knew she had to do something. She went outside to help them, and was surprise at how friendly they both were! They were very social and friendly, which makes us think that they had to have been someone's dogs. When they were brought to the shelter, they were scanned for a microchip but there was no sign of one. After a few days of no one coming to claim them, Apollo's sister was adopted. Our Texas rescue partners reached out to us to get this guy out of a sad shelter. He is now in a foster home while he waits on his transport date to Colorado, to find his forever home!\n\nApollo is likely a Bully/Boxer mix, according to the Texas vets. However, breed is just a guess, and he likely has multiple breeds in him! Apollo is about 2 years old, and 65 lbs. \n\nWith any rescue, moving from a shelter to a foster to an adoptive home can be very confusing. When an adopting family is sensitive to the challenges of change and acclimation for these dog's, the transition is far easier. A home with a very loving and nurturing family that understands that blossoming takes time would be perfect home for Apollo. Socialization, pure love and belly rubs is a gift to a dog that is undergoing a life change. Given the time and space, these dogs shine.\u00a0\n\nFarfel's Rescue has found over time (we've rescued more than 3,000 dogs over 15 years of rescue) that families that attend level 1 group training classes or address individual challenges at home with one of our approved positive reinforcement/force free trainers keep their dogs for life. Dogs that do not get proper training and socialization have a much higher risk of developing behavioral problems. There is a bonding that occurs through the training process that can't be duplicated. It also teaches behaviors that enable a dog to go out into the world with excellent manners that create a very respectful relationship between dogs and their humans. It is for all these reasons that Farfel's isn't willing to adopt to a family that doesn't choose to create this training relationship. Farfel's is happy to provide a list of approved positive reinforcement/ force-free trainers in your area.\u00a0\n\nApollo is up to date on his vaccines and neutered!\n\nApollo is arriving on transport in Boulder on 2/10/2021. Applications are currently being accepted for our wonderful pup. If interested in this gorgeous, very cuddly/sweet and loving best friend, please fill out an application completely at\u00a0http://farfels.com/farfels-rescue/adoption-form/\u00a0and submit.\n\n**PLEASE NOTE** If you're truly interested in adopting from us, please be sure to fill out our Farfel's Rescue adoption application found at the link above or at\u00a0farfels.com. Adoption site applications such as Petfinder, Rescueme and Adoptapet don't provide enough information and therefore aren't useful. Our Farfel's application is the only initial tool that we have to determine a great match for this very deserving puppy. We're sorry, but in most cases, we're unable to get back to those that don't submit our Farfel's Rescue adoption application. Thanks very much for choosing rescue.\n\n",

Pentagon weighs 13.2 pounds.\n\nPentagon will be available for adoption on Tuesday 2/2. Approved applicants will have the opportunity to meet the litter and choose their puppy. The first approved adopter will have choice of 10, the second will have choice of 9, etc. These puppies are not available to adopt in pairs.\n\nThe puppies appear to be a mix of working breeds. Mom appears to be a German Shepherd Dog mix (weighing 67#). The puppies are active and friendly. They are prone to nipping and herding and will benefit from puppy socialization classes.\n\nDuring shelter-in-place, Valley Humane is conducting adoptions by appointment only. If you would like to adopt Pentagon or a littermate, please complete an Adoption Inquiry Form (copy and paste the following URL into your browser), https://valleyhumane.org/adoption/adoption-inquiry-form/\n\nAn adoption counselor will reach out via telephone to conduct an adoption interview.

Do not submit an application if you are not available for an immediate meeting after submitting your adoption application.  \n\nStory of Bernice: \n\nBernice is a rescue from Perris, CA. She was found sitting in front of a house after the new tenant of the house reached out to the rescue in order to take possession of her. The rescue reached out to the neighbors living around that house and found that her previous owner left her roaming in the street. The rescue could obtain the phone number of her previous owner and managed to contact her. She said that she was forced to move into a small apartment due to the Pandemic. She also mentioned that her land lord does not allow dogs. \n\nBernice is a loyal dog. She kept waiting in front of the house where she used to live with her owner for days and she was trying to get inside everytimes the new tenant opens the door. The new tenant could not take her inside put he was giving her some of his left over food until he decided to find a rescue and reached out to us on our website. \n\nThe rescue took posession of Bernice and started preparing her for adoption. During her stay at PetEmber, Bernice received all the required vaccines along with their boosters. She also received flea and tick control medication, heart worm prevention medication, and she got dewormed. Finally, Bernice was operated for her spay by an experienced veterinarian. \n\nBehavioral wise, Bernice is so sweet and friendly family raised dog. She gets along with smaller and larger breeds of dogs. She used to live with a family who had children. You can trust Bernice around your friends, co-workers, family members, and strangers. She is super sweet with every. \n\nTraining wise, Bernice is potty trained, leash trained, crate trained, and trained to listen to orders. She eats grain free dry food and she is super healthy. \n\nBernice is a small dog. She is around 1.5 years old.\n\nIf you think that the characteristics mentioned above matches your criteria in a companion. Please consider giving Bernice a home. \n\n\nThe adoption process is simple: \n\n1- Fill and submit an online adoption application through the following link \n\nwww.petember.com/adoption-application \n\n2- Get ready for a phone interview shortly after (within 24 hours). \n\n3- If approved, a meet and greet will be scheduled (one to one - wearing a mask - complying with social distancing guidelines). \n\n4- If you decide to proceed forward with the adoption at the time of the meet and great, you will be asked to sign an adoption agreement and pay the adoption fee.

I love to snuggle and lay in the bed under blankets. I get very excited for treats and do the cutest spins! I love to zoom and play and I'm pretty entertaining! I play very well with my foster dog siblings so I would do well in a home with other small dogs (unsure about larger dogs). I am great with the cats in my foster home. I may not be the best for a home with small children.\n\nI am potty pad trained but will go outside with some guidance. I am crate trained.\n\nBeing fostered in Cincinnati, OH Can do meets in KY and IN also.\n\nIf interested in adopting, please go to littlehillsofkentucky.org and submit your application.",

When meeting new people, she can be shy. But once she warms up, Molly is very friendly.\n\nShe is smart and understands basic commands such as; sit, come, down.

She is friendly with other dogs but doesn't interact.\n\nMolly would be best in a quiet home with a fenced yard and no young children. She is not always comfortable with humans touching her and may nip if she can't cope with it or is not comfortable with it at the time. She is a young soul that enjoys playing with her toys and being outside.\n\nMolly is a low maintenance dog and will be an amazing fit for anyone with a similar lifestyle.",

            "description": "Iantha - This sweet, calm, affectionate 45-pound hound-mix mama is ready to begin her next chapter in a home where she will be loved and adored. She is an older lady and gets along well with other dogs (likely cats) and enjoys children short and tall. She loves to walk on a leash but her favorite activity is meal time where she jumps for joy as she awaits her next meal. She learned to navigate the doggy door with ease and is on her way to being housebroken. She prefers to sleep during the day on her mat and at night on the couch. She will make a fabulous pet in a house with or without another dog.\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

            "description": "Edward is a young guy (about 20 months old). He wasn't so sure on housetraining at first, but being the smart boy that he is, he got the dog door down in about 48 hours and has been accident free ever since! He's a true diamond in the rough! He's a baby and needs to learn a few manners but he's gentle and affectionate, which makes even his goofiest moments adorable. He is as snuggly as they come. He will literally climb into your lap and just melt there as long as you'll let him. He is very high energy though and will need lots of stimulation and interaction. He is athletic. He would do really well as someone's running buddy or agility buddy. He is very social. He does great with all other dogs and he would probably do well with an older animal in the home to help with manners and training. He is wonderful with kids or all ages, though he is still a little jumpy (training needed here). Untested with cats. He is crate trained but is already starting to gain his foster mom's trust that he can be out unattended and not get in puppy trouble. He will make a wonderful companion to anyone willing to put in some time with training and wants an energetic social friend to do life with.\n\nInterested in adoption? We are not currently accepting out of state (Texas) applications at this time. We require that all of our adopters have an approved application--you can find that on our website at www.austincockerrescue.org  Due to Covid 19, we are not conducting regular Meet and Greets. \n\n",

She adores people and makes friends with just about every person she meets. Although Wynona adores people she is a dominant female and does not do well with other dogs. Since this is the case she will not be adopted into a household with other dogs. Wynona is a happy, energetic dog who is eager to please. She is a quick learner and would thrive in a home where she gets plenty of daily exercise and mental stimulation. This big beautiful gal is now eagerly searching for a loving family to call her own.

She loves everything - treat time, snuggle time, and definitely play time. She love to show her foster brother a thing or two about being small but mighty! Allie can be pretty chill, but when she wakes from a nap, she is all play! She would do best in a home with a fenced yard as she loves her outside time and can spend a lot of time running around and enjoying the fresh air, so much so that she is doing very well with potty training. She definitely would benefit from having a mentor dog in the home to teach her all the great things about being a dog as she can be a little hesitant with new things like noises and unfamiliar animals. Once she sees that things are OK - she adapts super well with no issues. She's and would ready to find a loving family and would love to romp in the snow with you! Can you add her to yours this Valentine's Day?",

She loves everything - play time, snuggle time, and definitely treat time. Annie can be pretty chill, but when she plays, she is a bundle of energy. Tug-of-war is a favorite of hers, as are belly scratches. She would do best in a home with a fenced yard as she loves her outside time, but also would benefit most from having a mentor dog in the home to teach her all the great things about being a dog as she can sometimes be a little hesitant with new things and uses cues from her foster brother to know that everything is A-OK. Will you be her Mr/Mrs. Warbucks??",

He was found abandoned, tied to a pole at a church in Houston. He was very badly injured, emaciated, and very sick. Creed has been in intensive treatment for 8 months, and is now ready for adoption. He is a very sweet dog who seeks love and attention despite his rough beginning. Creed has battled some major medical hurdles. He needs a loving, patient home who can sympathize with his past and provide ongoing love and support. (Please note: We are not able to place Creed in an apartment setting.)\n\nCreed is located in Shillington, PA.\n\nTo apply for Creed, please visit: Adoptables | PA Pit Stop",

I LOVE LOVE LOVE my people ... I want to be with you all of the time in a very sweet way! I will get in your lap -- and watch out the window while you are away. I can help you with whatever you are doing! If you ignore me too long, I will do the silliest tail chasing until you tell me what a good dog I am - and I dare you to not laugh!! I also walk on my back legs. There MUST be some famous circus dog in my family!\n\nI am crate trained and very food motivated. Foster mom is trusting me out and I am not destructive but I will shred any paper I can find! I love dogs but am a little unsocialized with them so need a patient dog willing to let me jump and wrestle ... having that playmate as an energy outlet is key for me! A fence or VERY active person would be awesome .... (I play hard and non stop so I am probably too much for cats). \n\nI am working on jumping up - I just get so excited sometimes -- so not a good match for little kids yet, but I LOVE older ones! Despite my size, I am a water dog .... just give me a baby pool and WATCH THE FUN!!!!\n\nMeet me with an adoption application at freedom-ride.org",

This lil heartthrob is a 3 month old mixed breed that we think is a Terrier 3-4 mix. He is an absolute cuddle bug, who is affectionate, curious and intelligent! He can be shy around new people and pups but once he warms up to you, he\u2019s your new best friend that wants all your attention and pets! He\u2019s doing amazingly with training, he is close to being potty trained, and already knows \u201csit\u201d, \u201cshake\u201d, \u201cstay\u201d and \u201ccome\u201d- what a smart guy!! He is working on learning his crate is a safe space, but with continued work from his foster he is starting to spend more time in there. He is food-motivated and is learning how much fun the leash and walks can be. Randy loves nothing more than his toys and fetch, and he will even throw the ball for himself! We think he\u2019d do amazingly in a home with children as he has loved playing with all the kids he\u2019s met on his adventures. Randy will bring a lifetime of love and fun to any family lucky enough to call him theirs!",

I'm THE happiest boy ever and I will make you happy just being around me. I love to paw, lean and curve my body when you pet me and I will always ask for more. I'm a good boy when I eat and my tail will just wag faster than ever if you touch my food. I love other dogs and to me that just equals play time....stop in and see me soon...I'm available now! Adopting a dog from the Conway Animal Welfare Unit is a fairly easy process. The first step to adopting an animal is submitting an application. The application allows us to individually consider applicants and helps us to properly match our pets with new owners. We want to make sure that our pets are going to homes that are ready to provide for these pets long-term. Adoptions are $50 and this includes vaccinations, heartworm test, spay/neuter and microchip. As with any shelter animal, health is not guaranteed but we do our best to screen out those animals that are showing obvious signs of illness or disclose that information prior to adoption. All dogs are heartworm tested upon adoption. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting a dog and you reside OUTSIDE the city limits of Conway and the dog is less than 12 wks old, the cost is $75 which includes a spay/neuter and micropchip. The spay and neuter can only be performed at Vilonia Vet Clinic or Companion Animal Spay/Neuter Clinic. If the animal is less that 12 wks and you live inside the city limits the adoption fee is $25 dollars and you receive a voucher for $120 to use at select clinics for spay/neuter. The other option is that you provide us with proof of a pre-paid spay or neuter at YOUR vet of choice.",

Yogi loves to go on walks, is well mannered walking on the leash and he does okay in his crate. Yogi would be happiest if he could be the only dog in a calm, quiet home, without young kids. As you can imagine, the transition into a new home can be hard work for dog and we can not promise that any of our dogs do not chew on things or are housebroken. If you adopt Yogi, please give him some time to settle into his new routine and surroundings, and stay  committed to kind, consistent training. He has been vet checked and is heartworm positive-he is undergoing treatment for this and is on medical hold, but we are taking applications-Yogi\u2019s adoption fee is $300, Apply Today! \n\nIf you are interested in adopting from Boston Terrier and Short Nose Rescue of Oklahoma, please complete the Adoption Application here https://form.jotform.com/70368678829172 Please note that it can take several days to process an application as we are run entirely by volunteers, If you have completed an application, but have not heard from us within 3-5 days, please feel free to contact us. \n\nPlease note that we are foster-based and as such, we do not have a facility to visit the dogs. \n\nAll Boston Terrier and Short Nose Rescue of Oklahoma dogs are fully vetted at the time of adoption which includes spay/neuter, all vaccines - Rabies, Bordetella, and DHLP - along with heartworm check and the first month of preventative, and a vet check. Adoption fees vary per dog, but generally range from $150 to $450 depending on age and what vetting the dog required. The adoption fee is on a cash basis, is non-refundable, and is due at the time of the adoption. All adoption agreements state that the dog will be returned to the rescue if the adopter can no longer keep the dog for any reason. We highly recommend allowing at least a month for a dog to adjust; oftentimes settling into a new home can take time and lots and lots of patience.\n\nWhile we do adopt to out-of-state adopters, we will typically not adopt outside of an approximate 1200 mile radius from Muskogee, OK with a strong preference for in state and surrounding states. We do not transport our dogs; all dogs must be picked up in Oklahoma. There are many other Boston Terrier rescues throughout the country and if we are unable to adopt to you due to your location, we will do our best to point you in the direction of the rescues nearest to you. Please contact us with any questions.",

            "description": "Say howdy to this little beefcake, Bear! \nBear gets along with other dogs, but we think he would do best as an only dog, so he could enjoy ALL the belly rubs and snuggles! Sweet, easy to get along with, Bear walks well on a leash and is good in a crate. Please remember that the shifting into a new home can be hard work for a dog so give this guy some time to settle in to his new surroundings. We can not promise that any of our dogs do not chew on things or are housebroken so stay committed to giving them gentle, consistent training. Bear is about 4-5 years and has a bit of a unique issue in the genital area that causes him no issue or pain. Bear has been vet checked and his adoption cost is $350, Apply Today! \n\nIf you are interested in adopting from Boston Terrier and Short Nose Rescue of Oklahoma, please complete the Adoption Application here https://form.jotform.com/70368678829172 Please note that it can take several days to process an application as we are run entirely by volunteers, If you have completed an application, but have not heard from us within 3-5 days, please feel free to contact us. \n\nPlease note that we are foster-based and as such, we do not have a facility to visit the dogs. \n\nAll Boston Terrier and Short Nose Rescue of Oklahoma dogs are fully vetted at the time of adoption which includes spay/neuter, all vaccines - Rabies, Bordetella, and DHLP - along with heartworm check and the first month of preventative, and a vet check. Adoption fees vary per dog, but generally range from $150 to $450 depending on age and what vetting the dog required. The adoption fee is on a cash basis, is non-refundable, and is due at the time of the adoption. All adoption agreements state that the dog will be returned to the rescue if the adopter can no longer keep the dog for any reason. We highly recommend allowing at least a month for a dog to adjust; oftentimes settling into a new home can take time and lots and lots of patience.\n\nWhile we do adopt to out-of-state adopters, we will typically not adopt outside of an approximate 1200 mile radius from Muskogee, OK with a strong preference for in state and surrounding states. We do not transport our dogs; all dogs must be picked up in Oklahoma. There are many other Boston Terrier rescues throughout the country and if we are unable to adopt to you due to your location, we will do our best to point you in the direction of the rescues nearest to you. Please contact us with any questions.",

            "description": "Sugar Plum is a low maintenance 6yo, 8lb Pomeranian. She has a super fluffy beautiful coat and a sweet, spunky personality to match! She's shy because she came from a puppy mill but wants to be a part of whatever is happening. She does well with house training if she's kept on a schedule. She likes chewy dog bones and shows signs of playfulness. Once she trusts you, she wants to be near you often. She gets along with other dogs, snores, loves to snuggle, and is fine sleeping in either her bed or yours. Small children do not seem to phase her, and she'd do fine in a home with cats too. She enjoys having a comfortable bed to lie in, and many times you'll find her laying on her back. Her adoption fee is $500 which includes her being spayed, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines. If you're interested in adopting, please fill out an application on sftsrescue.org!\n\n*** Shelter From The Storm is currently closed to the public and adoption meetings are only available to those who have an approved application. Out of state applicants are welcome, but we are unable to assist in transportation and prefer that you live within 5 hours of us.",

            "description": "Meet Jingle Bells, a 2yo 46lb Boxer Mix! Jingle loves to play tug of war and fetch, and after she's tired out she appreciates some good snuggle time. She enjoys playing with the other dogs and would do well in a home with them. She's a smart and treat motivated girl who already knows some basic training commands, enjoys going on walks, and does great on leash. Jingle is already crate trained and hasn't had any accidents at the shelter. She also likes cats, although she can be a bit too energetic for them. Jingles favorite treats are chews, apples, mangos, chicken, tuna, salmon, strawberries, turkey, and cheese! She is sure that she would love other doggy safe fruits too if you're willing to share. Her adoption fee is $370 which includes her being spayed, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines! If you're interested in adopting, please fill out an application on our website at sftsrescue.org!\n\nJingle, also known as Ola, was adopted on 12/24 and returned on 1/17 because she needed more time/attention than the adopter was able to give her. Here's some great information that her previous home shared with us: \"Ola (Spanish for Wave because she has a wavy patch of fur on her back) is a 2 year old Boxer mix. She's very loving, affectionate, and playful. She loves fetch, tug of war, and knows basic commands as well. Ola is crate-trained and house-trained with zero accidents. She has stayed in her crate for up to 9 hours while I was at work. I don't know how she would behave at home alone outside her crate. She loves other dogs and people but because she is so excitable, it's best to have her restrained while meeting new people. She loves walks as well as loose leash walking in the city and tends to pull more in nature. Ola would love to live with another dog that wants to play with her, and have a yard to run around in. She gets bored easily so puzzle toys are also great for her.\"\n\n*** Shelter From The Storm is currently closed to the public and adoption meetings are only available to those who have an approved application.

He can be a couch potato and loves to be pet, but he also enjoys walks and running at the dog park. He is very gentle. Gets along well with the dogs he's been with and small children. He knows how to sit, wait for his food, walk on a leash, and is mostly kennel trained. He is a talker at times, and loves to tell you how he feels about things!\n\nRichie is heartworm positive. We are in search of a foster/ foster to adopt home for him to under go heartworm treatment. He will do best in a quiet space during this process. The recue will sponsor the treatment.\n\nRichie is located in Warrenton, OR.\n\nTo apply for Richie, please visit: Adoptables | PA Pit Stop",

Even if you've raised puppies in the past, this is an invaluable resource to help make your new addition successful!\n\nPlease note that this is a mixed breed puppy. Visual breed identification of companion animals has been proven to be unreliable, so for most of our animals we provide a best guess at predominant breed or breed mix. There is no guarantee on breed or adult size. We get to know each of our animals as an individual and do our best to describe and place pets based on personality not breed label.\n\nJames will need his human(s) to be committed to training, structure and lots of exercise. Puppy training classes will get him on his way, and advanced training will be wonderful for him. Keeping his canine brain active with games, puzzle toys, etc. will help channel his typical puppy energy. This puppy is in a foster home.

            "description": "\nLinus here and yes it is true I am a little shy...so be patient with me....just so many new things to take in....I am a neutered male Border/Lab mix about 2 yrs old and I weigh 37 lbs. I've been here a couple of days now and my owner hasn't come. Since I'm a little on the shy side I do belly crawl most places but my confidence is improving everyday. I'm easy to handle and love gazing at you with my big brown eyes. I'm a good boy on a leash as long as you give me time to learn and I love the company of other dogs. Stop in and see me soon....I'm available  now! Adopting a dog from the Conway Animal Welfare Unit is a fairly easy process. The first step to adopting an animal is submitting an application. The application allows us to individually consider applicants and helps us to properly match our pets with new owners. We want to make sure that our pets are going to homes that are ready to provide for these pets long-term. Adoptions are $50 and this includes vaccinations, heartworm test, spay/neuter and microchip. As with any shelter animal, health is not guaranteed but we do our best to screen out those animals that are showing obvious signs of illness or disclose that information prior to adoption. All dogs are heartworm tested upon adoption. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting a dog and you reside OUTSIDE the city limits of Conway and the dog is less than 12 wks old, the cost is $75 which includes a spay/neuter and micropchip. The spay and neuter can only be performed at Vilonia Vet Clinic or Companion Animal Spay/Neuter Clinic. If the animal is less that 12 wks and you live inside the city limits the adoption fee is $25 dollars and you receive a voucher for $120 to use at select clinics for spay/neuter. The other option is that you provide us with proof of a pre-paid spay or neuter at YOUR vet of choice.",

            "description": "I answer to Douglas, Sir Douglas, or even \"the man\" - but please do not call me Doug. Doug is a Pug's name and I am a barrel chested, virile, 6 year old, 80 pound English Bulldog. I certainly do not want to be compared to a toy breed. \n\nRight now I live near Baltimore, MD with my foster family but I am officially available for adoption! I came to the S.N.O.R.T. program because my owner is moving overseas and cannot take me along. I was a loved boy in my prior home, and I'm looking for a person or family who is ready for a canine addition to dote upon. Foster mom will tell you that I am well behaved in the house, sweet and an excellent guard dog. Some of my favorite things are car rides, toys, treats, belly rubs, lounging with my people and going for walks. As I mentioned, I am virile and thus a strong walker, so I will need someone able to manage my manliness on leash walks.  (Translation: I could benefit from some additional leash training.) Mostly I just want to be an important family member.  In foster care I live with 2 teenagers and other dogs. I get along well with everyone in the family. I am untested with cats. \n\nI am also in great health and require no medications. Since I am a good boy in the house, I do not even require a crate, although I have been crate trained when I was younger. I'm also neutered and microchipped and up to date on vaccines. \n\nThere is only one thing that I can report as a genuine dislike. I sometimes get nervous in new situations. I am not food or toy aggressive, but on 2 times I did nip at a stranger while I was in an unfamiliar situation. Both nips were on the hand, and minor. I would be best suited in a home with someone who is dog savvy, and a home without small children. \n\nWhether you work from home, or commute to a job, I am A-OK with your schedule. I am also not fussy on the type of environment that you have: house, apartment, fenced yard or unfenced, city or rural, all options are on the table for a good house guest like me. All I ask is that when you are finished with work, you set time aside each day for our daily walks (and leash training), and some good snuggle time afterwards. \n\nIf you are ready for this handsome (and virile) man to join your family, submit a S.N.O.R.T. adoption application today so that the S.N.O.R.T people can call and tell you more about me! Adoption fee: $400\n\nPlease submit an adoption application on our website!  https://www.snortrescue.org/adoption-process/adoption-application/\n\nNote: All dogs in SNORT's care are fostered in private homes by  dedicated volunteers. SNORT's adoption fee includes appropriate veterinary care, all necessary vaccines, and a spay/neuter.

            "description": "To be considered for adopting a dog from Canine Lifeline, you must have an approved application must be on file. Please visit http://www.caninelifeline.org/adoption-process/ for more information about our adoption process and to submit an online application.\n\nThis pretty girl is Sally, a 1.5 year-old who looks like a mix of Beagle and Min Pin. She was a natural in front of the camera and posted beautifully for her photos. We don't have any history on her as she came to us from an overcrowded rural county dog shelter but we have found her to be an absolute gem since her arrival. Sally gets along well with other dogs and has been friendly with all people that she's met. She does quite well on a leash, has excellent crate manners, and may be housetrained too although we can't guarantee that. Sally has plenty of spunk and can keep up with the big dogs so would make a great hiking or trail buddy for someone who wants a smaller dog. She's a smart girl who seems to pick up new routines quickly and would love to enroll in an obedience class with her new family to learn lots of new things. There are no cats in Sally's foster home so we don't know how she would be living with kitties. Sally weighs about 25 pounds and her adoption fee is $375. She's spayed, heartworm negative and on monthly preventative, up to date on vaccinations including bivalent canine influenza, wormed, on flea and tick preventative, and microchipped. As part of the adoption process, all adopters must commit to a two-week adjustment period to make sure it's a great match before the adoption is finalized. Please email info@caninelifeline.org if you're interested in Sally. An approved application is required before we schedule meets with any of our dogs. Please note that we don't place our dogs in homes with children under 7 years of age. We correspond via email so please check your junkmail or spam folder to make sure our reply hasn't landed in there. Please visit our website at www.caninelifeline.org to see more photos of Sally and to submit an online application if you live in Northeast OH.",

I\n\nwould love having a fur sister or brother (no cats) and my\n\nideal home needs to have a secure yard with a high fence.\n\nI like a lot of attention, and homebodies are my kind of people. I can be vocal, so apartments/condos would not be a good place for me. I need someone who is committed to work with me and reassure me that when they leave the house, they will come back.\n\nIf there's one thing I really love, it's when you cuddle and pet me but I also\n\nLOVE my walks! I can go out 3-4 times a day on long walks and never get tired.\n\nI\n\n'm doing amazing learning my house manners, but need someone who will continue my training.\n\nI love women, and older (10 and up) children, but it takes me a while to get used to men. Take it slow and easy with me and let me take the lead.\n\nI am loved and well-cared for with my foster family, yet I am ready for my forever loving home.\n\nI have had a thorough health examination, vaccinations, neutered and I'm microchipped. If you have room in your heart and home for me, please complete an adoption application. https://bichonrescueoc.org/adoption-application\n\nIn the struggle to cope with COVID-19 and its effects on our daily life, it has become necessary to suspend our customary adoption approval process. Scheduling your \"Home Safety Evaluation\" and \"Meet and Greet\" presents a significant challenge. If you express an interest in adopting this pup, we will make every effort to make that possible. You will be contacted to schedule a telephone interview and details of the current approval process will be explained.",

To adopt, complete our online adoption application and an Adoption Counselor will contact you within 48-hours to schedule your adoption appointment. Adoptions for any pets in foster will be completed offsite at our PetSmart Claiborne location on a case by case basis. The safety of our foster parents and community is of utmost importance to us and it will be at the foster's discretion if they'd like to meet at this time. Thank you for choosing adoption! \n\nChloe helped her pups grow and go to their forever families and now she needs a place of her own.  She is a little on the shy side and needs a family who can take it slow with her.  She is very affectionate and considers herself a lap dog.She is a young adult and ready to make the move into your home and into your heart.\n\nTo inquire about an adoptable animal from the Louisiana SPCA, please call 504.368.5191, ext. 150 to speak with an adoption counselor.\nTo see more adoptable animals from the Louisiana SPCA, please go to http://la-spca.org/adopt.\n\n\n\nThe petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n",

            "description": "Precious, precious Penny Ann! If you follow our Instagram account @btrescueok you have seen the heartbreaking, painful feats Miss Penny Ann has endured and overcome! \n\nPenny Ann is in need of a very special, quiet home where she will get a TON of love! A home where she will not have to spend time in a crate, but a place where she can lay in your lap and be petted and loved...she really loves being in your lap! A home where she can lay in the grass, sunbathe and take it easy for once! Penny Ann was was used for breeding and we believe she has spent most of her life in a crate-Penny Ann is 10 years old. Her feet are splayed, most likely from being in a crate for so long, she came to us with an irreparable broken jaw, a neglected, painful eye ulcer that resulted in her eye being removed. This dog needs and wants some love and kindness! As you can imaging she is nervous at first, but gets to trust you and opens up. And as we say for all our dogs, they may not be housebroken or might chew things and to give them some time to adjust to a new home, please give Penny Ann some time to adjust into your home and routine. She gets along with other dogs, and is learning how to play. Her adoption cost is $200, if you\u2019re the loving home for Penny Ann, apply today! \n\nIf you are interested in adopting from Boston Terrier and Short Nose Rescue of Oklahoma, please complete the Adoption Application here https://form.jotform.com/70368678829172 Please note that it can take several days to process an application as we are run entirely by volunteers, If you have completed an application, but have not heard from us within 3-5 days, please feel free to contact us. \n\nPlease note that we are foster-based and as such, we do not have a facility to visit the dogs. \n\nAll Boston Terrier and Short Nose Rescue of Oklahoma dogs are fully vetted at the time of adoption which includes spay/neuter, all vaccines - Rabies, Bordetella, and DHLP - along with heartworm check and the first month of preventative, and a vet check. Adoption fees vary per dog, but generally range from $150 to $450 depending on age and what vetting the dog required. The adoption fee is on a cash basis, is non-refundable, and is due at the time of the adoption. All adoption agreements state that the dog will be returned to the rescue if the adopter can no longer keep the dog for any reason. We highly recommend allowing at least a month for a dog to adjust; oftentimes settling into a new home can take time and lots and lots of patience.\n\nWhile we do adopt to out-of-state adopters, we will typically not adopt outside of an approximate 1200 mile radius from Muskogee, OK with a strong preference for in state and surrounding states. We do not transport our dogs; all dogs must be picked up in Oklahoma. There are many other Boston Terrier rescues throughout the country and if we are unable to adopt to you due to your location, we will do our best to point you in the direction of the rescues nearest to you. Please contact us with any questions.",

She loves snuggles on the couch with belly rubs. Annie also knows the command sit and takes treat very gently when she sits.\n\n\nAna is great with people and cats but can be picky about what dogs she wants to share her her home with so bring any household dogs to meet her (no large female dogs).\n\nAna is a new graduate of our prison obedience training program. She has learned Sit, Stay, Come, Off, Heel, Fetch and Down as well as beginning off leash training. she is staying at North Central Prison until adopted and will be adopted from there with a weekday appointment.\n\nAna is Heartworm Positive. This is a disease that is transmitted via mosquitos and can do damage to the heart if left untreated. The most challenging part of treatment is to keep the dog quiet. Belly rubs definitely will help get Ana to quiet down nicely. Canine Collective will be sent all treatment bills if taken to our vet (TAHO) in Delaware, OH (Orange Township).\n** If our dogs are posted online, they are available but may have other applications. To meet any dog, please fill out a short application in at CanineCollective.org. Our volunteers will process in about one business day and when approved you can text our kennel manager to make an appointment to meet/adopt your new forever companion. **",

Because of his energy level hemight be too much for little kids but he gets along with everyone.He does have that beautiful distinctive hound way of letting you know what he wants so probably would not be good in a home with shared walls.\n\n\nGetting him to sit still for a photo session is a fun time since he'd prefer to sniff and see everything near him ... that is to say he is a typical hound dog!!! He pulls a little on the leash but is easily corrected by his human.\n\n\nAtlas is a new graduate of our prison obedience training program. He has learned Sit, Stay, Come, Off, Heel, Fetch and Down as well as beginning off leash training. He is staying at North Central Prison until he is adopted and will be adopted from there with a weekday appointment.\n\n\nAs long as Atlas is on the website, he is available.

Housetrained, Crate trained, and Leash trained!\n\nMost animal lovers are looking for the perfect companion. But, what is the perfect companion? It's a pet that is loyal, fun and has undying love for said person. Well look no further! Clarice is a beautiful dog inside and out, she knows nothing but to love and just wants someone to love her. Clarice is a very smart, goofy and playful dog. Anyone will see how friendly she is and will fall in love with her. There are two caveats however: she is protective of HER people and doesn't like other pets.\n\nShe does however think she is a lap dog and may try to get in your lap. But she is a good size dog, so be ready. Clarice knows all the basic commands and then some. She loves rubber and hard chew toys.\n\nClarice is a new graduate of our prison obedience training program. She has learned Sit, Stay, Come, Off, Heel, Fetch and Down as well as beginning off leash training. She is staying at North Central Prison until she is adopted and will be adopted from there with a weekday appointment.\n\n** If our dogs are posted online, they are available but may have other applications. To meet any dog, please fill out a short application in at CanineCollective.org. Our volunteers will process in about one business day and when approved you can text our kennel manager to make an appointment to meet/adopt your new forever companion. **",

He just needs someone that is going to give him security. When inside he just wants to lean on you and be petted. Take him outside to a fenced area and he'll run and play till he can't no more.\n\n\nHe would do fine with kids, he's a gentle giant. Deano is house trained and kennel trained. He can be stubborn at times but knows, sit, down, stay, no, off, come, and he does. He is good with other dogs but we don't know about cats.\n\n\nDeano has just finished our prison obedience program and will be staying there until his adoption so he doesn't forget his training. Adoption will be done at the prison in Marion and the prison requires the adoptions to be done on weekday afternoons.\n\n\n** If our dogs are posted online, they are available but may have other applications. To meet any dog, please fill out a short application in at CanineCollective.org. Our volunteers will process in about one business day and when approved you can text our kennel manager to make an appointment to meet/adopt your new forever companion. **",

I can be between dominant sometimes and submissive, especially when my dominant sister gets a bit rough. I love being active, having toys and family members to play with too, and getting to explore whenever I can. I am still young for potty training but, I do good going on the potty pads my foster mom has laid out for me and my siblings. I am definitely a chewer cause I didn't have a mommy growing up to teach me not to, only my foster mom but I'm still learning and with training I will be the best of boys for you! I love being with my family, I don't really like car rides that much but I am definitely treat motivated!",

She is such a sweet, loving girl and will make a wonderful companion.  She wants to be an only pet.  In the chaos and noise of the shelter, she sits calmly and quietly.  She takes care of her sweaters, blankets and toys.  She is good in the bath and on the leash.  She does enjoy a nice walk.  We think she would be a wonderful companion for a person or a family with older kids, no infants or toddlers (our policy with any bully breed)  She will be available for adoption on February 5, 2021.",

At SDHS:This pet has been vaccinated, microchipped and spayed/neutered. This pet is now ready for their new home! Why this pet is the one for you: Meet Oreo the Chihuahua Mix! He is coy boy and he is looking for a calm quiet home with a patient family who will help him build his confidence again. He grew up with his siblings in a loving and although they had a wonderful time together, they didn't have a chance to get out much and explore the rest of the world. New places and faces can be stressful and he is counting on his new family to continue his positive association training as well as his positive reinforcement training. Due to his shyness, an adult home with low foot traffic would be best. However, older children who can listen to direction might be okay! Oreo can't wait to find his new best friend. Could it be you? Click on the \"Adopt Me\" button and follow the steps towards his adoption! \n Primary Color: Black Secondary Color: White Weight: 14.5lbs Age: 2yrs 0mths 0wks Animal has been Neutered",

            "description": "If you like to have fun and be on the go then I'm your gal! My name is Trixie and I am a spayed female Australian Shep mix about 2 yrs old and I weigh 28 lbs. I'm that happy gal that has a full body wag wherever I go! I love people and being in laps are the best place to be. I'm a good girl on a leash and get along great with other dogs. I am a little possessive of my food so I may be best suited in a home with older children who know not to touch my food or feed me in a secure location. Stop in and see me soon....I'm available now! Adopting a dog from the Conway Animal Welfare Unit is a fairly easy process. The first step to adopting an animal is submitting an application. The application allows us to individually consider applicants and helps us to properly match our pets with new owners. We want to make sure that our pets are going to homes that are ready to provide for these pets long-term. Adoptions are $50 and this includes vaccinations, heartworm test, spay/neuter and microchip. As with any shelter animal, health is not guaranteed but we do our best to screen out those animals that are showing obvious signs of illness or disclose that information prior to adoption. All dogs are heartworm tested upon adoption. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting a dog and you reside OUTSIDE the city limits of Conway and the dog is less than 12 wks old, the cost is $75 which includes a spay/neuter and micropchip. The spay and neuter can only be performed at Vilonia Vet Clinic or Companion Animal Spay/Neuter Clinic. If the animal is less that 12 wks and you live inside the city limits the adoption fee is $25 dollars and you receive a voucher for $120 to use at select clinics for spay/neuter. The other option is that you provide us with proof of a pre-paid spay or neuter at YOUR vet of choice.",

I will do the same in return.  Can you be my family?\n\nI will come with the works (Neutered/Spayed, up to date on everything, micro chipped, fecal, heartworm tested if age appropriate, heartworm, flea and tick preventative, one month insurance and free vet visit).  What more could a new family ask for?  COVID 19 restrictions:  If I have not been altered by adoption I will have to return to my vet for my procedure.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting and thinking about adoption, please visit our website http//www.wagginghearts.org and submit an adoption application. Include the name(s) of the animal(s) you are interested in the subject line of the email. Due to the high volume of applications we receive we are only able to process fully completed applications. We do not reply to inquiries. Since we are a foster based rescue we are unable to set up meet and greets until a completed application is on file and has been approved. \n\nWagging Hearts is a 100% foster-based, non-profit rescue organization. \n\nOur mission is to rescue abandoned, neglected, and stray companion animals.

He gets along with other dogs; but, sometimes other dogs aren't so sure about his energy. He has a lot of energy and loves to go on long hikes or long walks. He will benefit from a home with a yard or kids to play with. When he does go on walks, he is investigative and will pick up everything while walking. This is a behavior that can be easily fixed with training.\n\nAre you interested in rescuing Bandit - please email us at VegasRootsRescue@gmail.com",

Please read this posting to answer most of your questions about me.\n\nHello  meet Dopey from our Snow White Litter, he\u2019s a beautiful shepherd mix that was surrendered to the the Hope Fur Pets Rescue.  Dopey is around 9-10 weeks old, he is the only one still available in the litter of 7. He\u2019s super playful loves kids and exploring. I'm all up to date on vet care appropriate for my age including heartworm prevention, spay/neuter, microchip and all vaccinations and ready to be the newest member of your home! \n\nPlease fill out our application an application is required in order to be considered: copy the below text and paste it into your browser:  \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1K_84a3Y0wF0QbdYBz17b10Uwm4kAXxz-Y0Gx5HexZz0/edit\n\nIf you have any questions, please send an email to hopefurpets@gmail.com\n\nUs fur-kids deserve a second chance. Thank you for supporting rescues who help ensure we get one! And please remember to spay and neuter your pets and neighborhood strays! While I was at the shelter, I couldn't believe all of the wonderful dogs, cats, puppies, and kittens who are homeless. Take it from me, being homeless is no fun!\n\nApplication is required. No member of our organization receives proceeds from our adoption fees.  All dogs have past experiences, preferences and personalities.  Please always consider the personality and breed tendencies of any pup that you are interested in adopting to ensure that he or she will be the perfect fit for your home, for both your sake and his!  Do not select a forever companion based on looks alone.  Make this home his or her home for life!",

            "description": "Say hello to Brutus! He is a sweet boy who likes dogs and cats and people of all ages. He was found on the side of the road and taken in by a foster and they contacted us to help find him a home where he won't be left to wander on his own ever again. He is estimated at about 5 years old and has had a tough life evidenced by his teeth being worn down. He certainly doesn't seem to hold any grudges though. He's also heartworm negative and scheduled to be neutered soon! Because we are foster based, we require an approved application before a meet and greet can be scheduled. We think that is fair for our fosters so every meet and greet has the potential to result in an immediate adoption. The application is available on the rescue website and can be completed online.We work with many rescues and strive to find every rescued dog in our care a great home. Sometimes that means transferring that pet to another location where adoption may be more likely. We currently have partners in New York, Pennsylvania, and Vermont.\n\nIf you are interesting in meeting any of our pets, the process is to complete an application. It can be downloaded as a pdf document from our website and submitted by email to WindyRidgeRescue@gmail.com as a scanned document or as photos OR can be completed entirely online. Both links are in the header of our website.\n\nBecause we are foster based, we require an approved application to schedule a meet and greet. We feel that is fair to our fosters and rescues so every meet and greet can result in an adoption.\n\nWe do not have set adoption fees for dogs, but hope adopters will donate generously so we can rescue more. The medical care for every dog can easily exceed the adoption donation. Average adoption fees for dogs in the area range from $175 up to $450.\n\nWe ask for a minimum adoption donation of $50 for cats regardless of age. Each cat is up to date on vaccinations, dewormer, and microchipped. Larger donations are always welcome so we can rescue more. Medical care for each cat easily exceeds the minimum donation.\n\nAs with every rescue, our resources are limited and the need for rescue help is unlimited. Your generosity helps us to rescue more.\n\nAdopting or fostering for a rescue frees up a space where a new rescue can reside.\n\nIf you can't adopt or foster, than please consider donating.",

There are a couple of things I should tell you about myself before we go any further...I have an old injury to my left front leg...I don't really remember what happened but my doc thinks it could have been an old break that was allowed to heal on it's own.....and to top things off I have those dreaded heartworms that everyone fears. I'm not scared though...I feel great and there is a nice group that will help have me treated once I'm adopted....now for the good stuff! I'm a 100% lap dog, face licker, pawer and leaner...like I could be a professional. I love to roll over and show my belly. Toys don't really interest me much...I wanna play with you! I'm a good boy when I eat and never show aggression with my food. Oh and you should see me with other dogs...amaaaaaazing! Stop in and see me soon, I'm available now! \nAdopting a dog from the Conway Animal Welfare Unit is a fairly easy process. The first step to adopting an animal is submitting an application. The application allows us to individually consider applicants and helps us to properly match our pets with new owners. We want to make sure that our pets are going to homes that are ready to provide for these pets long-term. Adoptions are $50 and this includes vaccinations, heartworm test, spay/neuter and microchip. As with any shelter animal, health is not guaranteed but we do our best to screen out those animals that are showing obvious signs of illness or disclose that information prior to adoption. All dogs are heartworm tested upon adoption. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting a dog and you reside OUTSIDE the city limits of Conway and the dog is less than 12 wks old, the cost is $75 which includes a spay/neuter and micropchip. The spay and neuter can only be performed at Vilonia Vet Clinic or Companion Animal Spay/Neuter Clinic. If the animal is less that 12 wks and you live inside the city limits the adoption fee is $25 dollars and you receive a voucher for $120 to use at select clinics for spay/neuter. The other option is that you provide us with proof of a pre-paid spay or neuter at YOUR vet of choice.",

We are thinking these precious little ones are a Boxer and Jack Russell Terrier mix.\n\nBellagio has a beautiful sable coat and loves playing with her littermates or you! The pups are great around other dogs, kids of all ages, and are only mildly interested in cats, in a playful way. As these friendly pups are still so young, they haven't started potty training, crate training, or leash training, but think they will pick up these skills quickly as they seem very smart.\n\nThey're eager to please, toy and treat motivated little squirts, so puppy training classes will be lots of fun!\n\nThe Casino pups are pretty quiet, but you might hear them bark when playing. They love toys especially ones that squeak!\n\nBellagio would love to find a forever family that has lots of time and patience to raise a puppy properly, and who has lots of extra time for loving and cuddles. If you are looking for a puppy, Bellagio (or one of her littermates) may be perfect for you! Fill out an application today and let her know that you'd love to have her join your family!\n\nAdoption Fee: $585\n\nTo apply for this dog, fill out an adoption application on our website: www.sosarl.org/aa/\n\n**Additional info you should know - For most of our dogs, we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix.

(as of 1/2/2021)\n\nThis dog has been spayed/neutered, is up to date on shots, on heartworm preventative and is microchipped.\n\nMeet Denver, one of the five puppies in the Lonestar litter!\n\nThese pups are about 3 months old and look to be Border Collie mixes. There are three females (Houston, San Antonio, and Austin) and two males (Dallas and Denver) in the litter. Their mom was found pregnant and taken in by a senior couple, and we're now looking for homes for her five sweet babies.\n\nThe Lonestar puppies have been in their foster home since birth, living in a generally quiet household with some other dogs and cats. Denver loves chasing and wrestling with his brothers and sisters.\n\nLike most young puppies, Denver is affectionate and playful, but will need help learning basic training skills. He'll need to be in a home with human(s) who can take the time to practice house manners, including house-, crate- and leash training. We'd recommend group training classes, ideally starting within the first 60 days of bringing Denver home, so that he can get into a good training routine right away. Puppy classes are a great way to reinforce the skills and commands that you're practicing at home, with the added bonus of some extra socialization time with other dogs! Denver seems to be very intelligent and eager to please -- two traits that typically add up to a trainable and obedient dog.\n\nIn addition to training, Denver will need a good amount of daily exercise (ideally 1-2 hours per day) and mental stimulation. He'll be a great companion for walks, running around in the yard, or taking a trip to the dog park -- he does well in the car and would be up for tagging along on some adventures! Denver would also love a variety of fun toys to play with, including squeaky toys, brain-teaser puzzle toys, and some chew toys, especially while he's teething in his puppy stage.\nA\ntired dog is a happy dog! At the end of a fun-filled day, Denver will be happy to curl up with his new family and relax.\n\nReady to bring Denver home to his fur-ever home?

The litter is seven beautiful girls - Bangles, Bowie, Joan Jett, Journey, Bon Jovi, Leppard, and Madonna and two handsome boys - Motley Crue and Van Halen. We are thinking these little ones are an American Bulldog and Terrier mix. The pups are named after famous pop and rock musicians from the 1980s.\n\nThe pups love all people including kiddos. They are friendly and playful with other dogs but we don't know how they are with cats. They love toys and are happy to chill with a squeaky ball when not playing with you! The pups are pretty quiet but you might hear them bark when playing.\n\nAs the pups are still so young, they haven't yet started on potty training, crate training or leash training but think they will pick up these skills quickly as they seem very smart.

(as of 1/2/2021)\n\nThis dog has been spayed/neutered, is up to date on shots, on heartworm preventative and is microchipped.\n\nMeet San Antonio, one of the five puppies in the Lonestar litter!\n\nThese pups are about 3 months old and look to be Border Collie mixes. There are three females (Houston, San Antonio, and Austin) and two males (Dallas and Denver) in the litter. Their mom was found pregnant and taken in by a senior couple, and we're now looking for homes for her five sweet babies.\n\nThe Lonestar puppies have been in their foster home since birth, living in a generally quiet household with some other dogs and cats. San Antonio loves chasing and wrestling with her brothers and sisters.\n\nLike most young puppies, San Antonio is affectionate and playful, but will need help learning basic training skills. She'll need to be in a home with human(s) who can take the time to practice house manners, including house-, crate- and leash training. We'd recommend group training classes, ideally starting within the first 60 days of bringing San Antonio home, so that she can get into a good training routine right away. Puppy classes are a great way to reinforce the skills and commands that you're practicing at home, with the added bonus of some extra socialization time with other dogs! San Antonio seems to be very intelligent and eager to please -- two traits that typically add up to a trainable and obedient dog.\n\nIn addition to training, San Antonio will need a good amount of daily exercise (ideally 1-2 hours per day) and mental stimulation. She'll be a great companion for walks, running around in the yard, or taking a trip to the dog park -- she does well in the car and would be up for tagging along on some adventures! San Antonio would also love a variety of fun toys to play with, including squeaky toys, brain-teaser puzzle toys, and some chew toys, especially while she's teething in her puppy stage.\n\nA tired dog is a happy dog! At the end of a fun-filled day, San Antonio will be happy to curl up with her new family and relax.\n\nReady to bring San Antonio home to her fur-ever home? Fill out our application today!\n\nAdoption Fee: $585\n\nTo apply for this dog, fill out an adoption application on our website: www.sosarl.org/aa/\n\n**Additional info you should know - For most of our dogs, we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix.

He has been easy to handle but needs some confidence building. I've had him on walks with a few dogs and he acts interested in meeting them, but gets scared and hides behind me when they get too close to him. He has a laceration on the bottom of his left paw, but it looks to be healing with time. He's still tender on it, but otherwise doing well.\n\nWe ask for a $200 donation for all of our adult dogs. All of our adult dogs are neutered/spayed, microchipped, have had their Rabies, Parvo(5-way), and Bordetella vaccines.\n\nRescue Ranch is open from 12-4 seven days a week. You can call us at (530)842-0829 or email us at inquiries@rrdog.org",

Jack Russell Terriers need homes with a secure fence.  Underground fencing is NOT safe for a  Jack Russell.  \n2. Jack Russell terriers are bred to be hunting dogs and are not suited to apartment or condo life.  The hunting instincts and prey drive cannot be trained out of  these terriers and they will stay active in this way all their lives.\n3. We do not adopt Jack Russell Terriers to families withe small children (under 6) as terriers are not patient with the antics of a small toddler.   \n4. Jack Russell Terriers can not safely coexist in a home with cats, birds, ferrets, hamsters, rabbits, etc, as terriers were bred to hunt and can kill small animals.  They are hunters and they never give up. \n5. Please keep an open mind and consider your lifestyle both today and 10 years from now before you apply for a dog that may not be a good fit for the long run.",

            "description": "Hey I'm Aldo!Aldo was born around October 13, 2013, and weighs about 80 pounds. Aldo came to us rather thin and we feel it might have been the stress in the home. He is eating beautifully and we hope he puts on a few pounds once his life stabilizes. Aldo is with us because his humans had a baby. All was good until the baby started to crawl which freaked Aldo out and he snapped at the 9-month-old. Aldo will be fine living with children as long they are past the crawling stage. Aldo is just about perfect. He rides well in the car, is wonderful off leash, and plays beautifully with the other dogs. Aldo enjoys chasing cats a bit too much to live with any. Aldo will swim but tends to wade more. He LOVES playing frisbee and playing with toys. He doesn't know he's a GSD and in the evenings will try and sit in your lap while you watch your soap operas. Aldo is going to make an incredible new addition and we promised him no one will ever leave him homeless again. The Adoption Fee for this dog is $375.00\nAdoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a 'complete' pet. We accept CASH or Visa/Mastercard ONLY.\n\nJoyful Rescues has no funding except for our adoption fees and miscellaneous donations. Pet care and vet bills are expensive - you must be ready to take on this financial (as well as emotional) responsibility. YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 25 YEARS OF AGE TO ADOPT A DOG FROM JOYFUL RESCUES\n\nWe keep our pet list as up-to-date as possible. As soon as a pet is adopted, it is removed from the list. If a pet is still showing, it is still available for adoption.\n\nCan't Adopt Me? SPONSOR ME\nLook for the Link 'Special Instructions to Seller' if you want to note a particular pet\nBefore you seek to adopt a pet from Joyful Rescues, please read our Pet Adoption page http://www.joyfulrescues.org/pet_adoption.html.\n\nOnline Application",

            "description": ",Due to COVID-19, all adoptions will be by appointment only. To adopt, complete our online adoption application and an Adoption Counselor will contact you within 48-hours to schedule your adoption appointment. Adoptions for any pets in foster will be completed offsite at our PetSmart Claiborne location on a case by case basis. The safety of our foster parents and community is of utmost importance to us and it will be at the foster's discretion if they'd like to meet at this time. Thank you for choosing adoption! \n\nThis sweet active playful boy is looking for a forever family who can take the time to train him using hand signals.  He responds well to treat rewards for wanted behaviors and already knows \"sit \",  He meets new people very nicely and seems to enjoy other dogs.  He now just needs a chance to show you what a wonderful addition he would be to your family.\n\nTo inquire about an adoptable animal from the Louisiana SPCA, please call 504.368.5191, ext. 150 to speak with an adoption counselor.\nTo see more adoptable animals from the Louisiana SPCA, please go to http://la-spca.org/adopt.\n\n\n\nThe petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n",

            "description": "Jack and Pogo have been waiting a long time to find a loving new home while a court case was being waged over them. They were loved by a couple who had a different idea than most of us what the inside of a home should look like. Sadly it was the passing of their owners that has set them free to have a new home. Like all pets they loved their family but they adjusted well to living in a kennel and now will be coming to us 2/3 along with the cats in the family.\nJack is an 8 year old fellow believed to be a German Shephard/Akita mix or another breed that has a beautiful coat like his. These are breeds that very smart and loyal. Pluto is an 8 year old female German Shephard. Both dogs are loving and love each other and are only being placed together. They are 8 years old.\nTheir owners were older and we do not know if there were any children that visited. Due to the condition of the home we doubt it. The ACO's who cared for the dogs has told us they are both very sweet dogs. The dogs do not understand what toys are but they are playful with each other. Pogo loves everyone she meets and other dogs.  Jack needs a few minutes to warm up and then is fine and is fine with most dogs. They need a home where they are the only dogs. Once we have them we will get some sweet photos and update their personality profile.\n\nWe give priority to people that fill out our adoption application, so if you are interested in meeting this dog, please go to https://www.medfieldshelter.com/adoption-forms/dog and fill out the application. \n\nE-mail inquiries about a dog are not considered an application. \n\n\nIf a dog is listed on our website, that means that dog is still available for adoption. The Shelter is staffed primarily by volunteers so adoption meetings take place by appointment. Our dog adoption fee for dogs 5 years old or younger is $350.  Every dog we place is given age-appropriate vaccines, wormed, treated for ticks/fleas, tested for heartworm and spayed/neutered prior to adoption.  We send each dog home with a collar and leash and a month's worth of heartworm preventative. If a dog is listed on our website, they are still available for adoption. Please fill out the adoption application if you would like to be considered for a dog you see in our care.\n\nWith very few exceptions, dogs are happiest and the most well-behaved when they receive daily exercise and ongoing training, so we always prefer to place our dogs with families who are willing to make a commitment to both.",

First, dogs just want to be happy and feel loved. Living inside and being a part of the family is really important to us. A lot of the things you need as humans to stay happy and healthy, us dogs need too. We depend on you for things like vet visits, nutritious food, clean water, social and play time with people and other pets, training classes, toys, and of course, lots of love and attention! Regular baths, nail trims and grooming help us to look and feel our best, while monthly flea and heartworm prevention help us to stay healthy. Did you know that depending on our size and breed, dogs can live up to 20 years? Just think of the wonderful life we could have together!",

            "description": "Any Beatles fans out there? Here is some trivia that you never knew you needed (and probably don't). Ausflipper is the German translation for Day Tripper, a song covered by a German Beatles revival band. Our Ausflipper isn't a day tripper of the type in the song, but he'd certainly like to take a permanent day trip out of the shelter! This handsome young guy was brought to PACC as a stray, so his past is a bit of mystery. Heck, maybe he's the founding member of the German Beatles cover band. When meeting other dogs in PACC playgroup, Ausflipper was playful and sweet with the other pooches, though he is a bit wary of people and needs time to warm up. This easygoing guy is looking for a home without young children, and breed experience is always a plus. Take a trip with Ausflipper today!",

When meeting other dogs in PACC playgroup, Grover was tolerant, appropriate and easygoing. Ask about helping a senior dog today!! I walked Grover tonight. He's super easy to leash and a total sweetheart. Pretty active for an 8 year old dog. Super sweet and affectionate! - PACC Volunteer",

Sadly, Rosabella was found as a stray, and we can't imagine what it was like for a senior girl like her to be on her own. She's safe and sound at the shelter now, but this is no place for a respected elder to spend their retirement. Rosabella has some old lady problems that the PACC clinic is helping her with, and would love to find a cozy home where she can be pampered and adored as soon as possible. Rosabella has some vision impairment, so sometimes new situations can startle her. Because of this, a dog introduction is required to make sure it's a good fit. Ask how you can help this beautiful rose today!",

            "description": "Grant and Bacall, like the movie stars they are named after, are classic cuties. Their mom is a wire haired terrier, but their looks may take after dad, who is unknown (but clearly adorable). At two months old and weighing in at 6 pounds (Grant) and almost 4 pounds  (Bacall), they will likely be in the medium size range when fully grown. Bacall is a sweet, shy little girl who will play with her stuffed animals and fur siblings, but then look for cuddles and comfort with her humans. Her favorite activity is giving kisses while she is held by her foster mom. Grant and Bacall are fostered with dogs of all ages and sizes and a cat. Right now, they are potty pad and puppy pen trained, with some introductions to a crate. Who can resist Bacall\u2019s chubby belly and soft wrinkly face???  If you are looking for a loving fur baby to add to your family, consider adopting Grant or Bacall!  Their adoption fee is $400.00.\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

I'm being as brave as I can be but truth is I'm pretty scared. I'm a sweet boy, love to be close and love kids. I like to spend every second I can with my hoomans and when left alone I get a little anxious. I'm a good boy on a leash and enjoy walks but have a couch potato side too! Stop in and visit me soon....I'm available now! Adopting a dog from the Conway Animal Welfare Unit is a fairly easy process. The first step to adopting an animal is submitting an application. The application allows us to individually consider applicants and helps us to properly match our pets with new owners. We want to make sure that our pets are going to homes that are ready to provide for these pets long-term. Adoptions are $50 and this includes vaccinations, heartworm test, spay/neuter and microchip. As with any shelter animal, health is not guaranteed but we do our best to screen out those animals that are showing obvious signs of illness or disclose that information prior to adoption. All dogs are heartworm tested upon adoption. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting a dog and you reside OUTSIDE the city limits of Conway and the dog is less than 12 wks old, the cost is $75 which includes a spay/neuter and micropchip. The spay and neuter can only be performed at Vilonia Vet Clinic or Companion Animal Spay/Neuter Clinic. If the animal is less that 12 wks and you live inside the city limits the adoption fee is $25 dollars and you receive a voucher for $120 to use at select clinics for spay/neuter. The other option is that you provide us with proof of a pre-paid spay or neuter at YOUR vet of choice.",

He would do best in a home with shy dog experience that understands he needs some time to warm up and some patience. Scottie just needs someone to provide him with unconditional love and to help raise his confidence.\n\nScottie #2 will be available for adoption on 1/30/2021 at 4:51 PM.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this pet please fill out an adoption questionnaire at www.yakimahumane.org. A Yakima Humane Society staff member will contact you once your questionnaire has been received.\n\nIf you would like to adopt this pet you can fill out an online adoption form at www.yakimahumane.org. Please give the name and ID number for the animal you wish to adopt.\nIf you are thinking about adding a pet to your family, be a hero, please consider adopting a shelter pet and if you already have pets \u2013 for life\u2019s sake \u2013 spay and neuter. Spaying and neutering your pets is the single most important thing you can do to help decrease our nations severe pet overpopulation.\n*NOTE: Nearly 90% of the animals that come into our shelter are abandoned, neglected, traumatized, injured, or ill. We attempt to give our best assessment of the animal\u2019s welfare and temperament. Unfortunately, due to lack of funding, volunteers, and resources our physical and mental assessment of the animal is not always 100% correct.",

I love cuddling, some would call me a cuddle bug and I love it so much I want to be the only to get all the cuddles. I love people, including kids and love to play and toys, don\u2019t get me started. I am kennel trained, but not great on a leash yet, I will need some help to understand how that works but I do love to be outside, I also love to stand in my pool to cool my feet but like any lady please don\u2019t splash, you may mess up my hair. I have been around this thing called a wheelchair and it doesn\u2019t bother me at all. I can get a little scared of loud noises such as fireworks, they are pretty scary you know. Small dogs are my favorite, the big ones can be a bit intimidating, but I get along with them too. I get a little nervous meeting new people, but I warm up quickly and just want to please my humans. Please consider me for your furever family, I know we can learn and grow together.\n\nOur organization only adopts within the United States.\n\nFaith and Hope is a multi-state rescue with locations in Texas, Washington and Oregon. All dogs are rescued from the state of Texas to and transported to our Washington and Oregon locations with placement in their adoptive families. Our $425 adoption fee includes all core vaccinations (DHPP, rabies, spay/neuter, microchip)\n\nIf interested in learning more, please email us at faithandhopeadoptions@gmail.com or fill out our online application.\n\nhttps://www.faithandhopefoundation.org/adoptionapp\n\nIf interested in learning more about our adoptable dogs and adoption process, or our foster home program, please contact us at above email.\n\nDue to the number of requests that we receive on our puppies and dogs, please be advised that all adoption applications are processed in the order received. Once we send you an application, your place in line does not get reserved until your application is returned to us.",

            "description": "Coach is a lab mix who was born approximately Dec. 19, 2014. He was adopted from our shelter as a puppy but was recently returned to us because his adopter was moving. Coach is a sweet, friendly, energetic boy with tons of love to give!  He's got a great sense of humor and loves to grab his favorite toy in hopes of some playtime whenever it's his turn to go outside, or when he has visitors.  \n\nCoach would do best in a home with a fenced yard for his safety, and to help ensure he gets plenty of exercise. Coach weighs 86 lbs.\n\nCoach is VERY interested in cats and would probably chase them, if given the chance. For that reason, we recommend that he be in a home without cats.\n\nPlease note: Due to COVID-19, our visitation policy has changed. LIFE House is currently open by appointment only to individuals with approved applications. Please download the adoption from our website at http://lifehouse4animals.org/Adopt.aspx and email it directly to the adoption counselor at amyc0405@yahoo.com. If your application is approved, the adoption counselor will facilitate an appointment for you to meet this animal.\n\nWe are located at 14 Fido Ct., Frankfort KY 40601.\n\nIf you have questions about this animal, please contact the adoption counselor directly at amyc0405@yahoo.com. We are staffed by volunteers and are typically unable to complete the adoption process on the same day that applications are submitted. Please understand that it can sometimes take 2-4 days to process an application.",

            "description": "Bucky is a local owner surrender. He is an very expensive AKC registered retired breeder. He has sired sone gorgeous, excellent temperament puppies in his time as a stud. He comes from a very responsible and conscientious breeder who spent the time to house train him (he does not mark) and socialize him extremely well. He loves children and other dogs.  He is current on all vaccines, microchipped and neutered. He is very kennel trained for night time sleeping. Not a digger or a chewer. He knows to lay on his pillow when in the house.  He is 5 yrs old. He will require regular professional grooming every. 6 weeks to 2 months, as he has an extremely thick, long growing show coat that will become hopelessly matted if not tneded to. This will coat between $45-65 per grooming, depending on who your groomer is. Cocker Spaniels are the #2 most neglected \"grooming\" dogs 2nd only to Shihtzus. Its so sad to get them in smelly, matted & miserable with neglected coats because people think they can do it themselves or do not have the financial ability to provide for them.  Please take this into consideration before applying for Buck. Cockers are also an exceptionally long lived breed, often going to 16 years. At 5, he has a LONG life ahead of him.",

I love cuddling, some would call me a cuddle bug and I love it so much I want to be the only to get all the cuddles. I love people, including kids and love to play and toys, don\u2019t get me started. I am kennel trained, but not great on a leash yet, I will need some help to understand how that works but I do love to be outside, I also love to stand in my pool to cool my feet but like any lady please don\u2019t splash, you may mess up my hair. I have been around this thing called a wheelchair and it doesn\u2019t bother me at all. I can get a little scared of loud noises such as fireworks, they are pretty scary you know. Small dogs are my favorite, the big ones can be a bit intimidating, but I get along with them too. I get a little nervous meeting new people, but I warm up quickly and just want to please my humans.

            "description": "Grant and Bacall, like the movie stars they are named after, are classic cuties. Their mom is a wire haired terrier, but their looks may take after dad, who is unknown (but clearly adorable). At two months old and weighing in at 6 pounds (Grant) and almost 4 pounds  (Bacall), they will likely be in the medium size range when fully grown. Grant has been the leader of the pack since birth - he\u2019s smart, very active, and wants his foster mom and fur siblings to engage in serious play sessions, followed by belly rubs when he gets tired. His favorite activity is playing tug or chasing his rope bones. Grant and Bacall are fostered with dogs of all ages and sizes and a cat. Right now, they are potty pad and puppy pen trained, with some introductions to a crate. Who can resist Grant\u2019s spots and baby blue eyes???  If you are looking for a loving fur baby to add to your family, consider adopting Grant or Bacall!  Their adoption fee is $400.00.\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

Please visit http://www.caninelifeline.org/adoption-process/ for more information about our adoption process and to submit an online application.\n\nThis handsome and very photogenic big guy is Diesel, a 2.5 year-old Great Pyrenees/Border Collie mix. He has double dewclaws characteristic of a Great Pyr along with a definite stubborn streak which the breed is also known for. Diesel is a lovable guy whose world has been turned upside down recently. His owner was a young guy who had to move in with family but they didn't allow him to bring Diesel along so he had to go to the local county dog shelter to find himself another home. From there, he made the trip to Canine Lifeline so he could take his time finding the perfect new home. Diesel gets along with other dogs but if there's another dog in his new home, he would probably do best with a calm spayed female. He would also do best with a home that has a yard with a secure aboveground fence to keep him safe at home-no invisible fence for this boy. As mentioned above, Diesel does have a stubborn streak so to convince him to do something he doesn't want to do (like going in a crate), you have to make him think it's his idea or have a very tasty food reward for him. He walks amazingly well on a leash and likes to meander and sniff everything possible when on his walks. Diesel may be housetrained but we can't guarantee it. He would be happiest in a home where his family would be around much of the time. There are no cats in Diesel's foster home so we don't know how he would be living with them. Diesel weighs about 65 pounds and his adoption fee is $325. He's neutered, heartworm negative and on monthly preventative, up to date on vaccinations including bivalent canine influenza, wormed, on flea and tick preventative, and microchipped. As part of the adoption process, all adopters must commit to a two-week adjustment period to make sure it's a great match before the adoption is finalized. Please email info@caninelifeline.org if you're interested in Diesel. An approved application is required before we schedule meets with any of our dogs. Please note that we don't place our dogs in homes with children under 7 years of age. We correspond via email so please check your junkmail or spam folder to make sure our reply hasn't landed in there. Please visit our website at www.caninelifeline.org to see more photos of Diesel and to submit an online application if you live in Northeast OH.",

He has been enjoying the cooler weather and playing in the snow over the past couple weeks! Timber has done okay with some of the female dogs here, but can be grumpy with other male dogs. We would recommend you bring any potential dog roommates with you to see if they'll get along. Timber might be housetrained. He keeps his kennel very clean as long as you let him outside regularly for potty breaks. Like most nordic breeds, Timber has shown that he can jump fences pretty easily, so he will need a home with secure fencing. This beautiful boy is a head turner, and he's ready for his forever home!\n\nTimber is estimated to be about 2 years old and weighs 50 pounds. His adoption fee is $40.00 and our shelter is only open by appointment at this time. Please call or email us if you'd like to learn more or schedule a meet-and-greet with Timber.\n530-841-4028 or shoffman@co.siskiyou.ca.us",

            "description": "Please let us introduce Boots.  If this gorgeous girl could talk, what a sad story she would tell!  She and her siblings spent the first few months of their lives struggling to survive.  They were born to a mom and dad who were sadly neglected by their owners and basically left to fend for themselves.  The canine family was kept in a fenced yard with little food or water and would escape to desperately search through the neighbors\u2019 trash.  Ultimately, two of the puppies were shot and the dad was poisoned\u2026hard to imagine, but true.  Thankfully, one of our rescue heroes learned of their plight and managed to get Boots and her two other siblings to the safety of his home where they have been in foster care and are receiving the TLC that every pup deserves.\n\nBoots is about 11 months old and weighs in at approximately 85 lbs.  She is an Anatolian Shepherd - a real beauty!  When she first came to her foster home, she cowered from all people, but she\u2019s made good progress since learning that there can be kindness in human touch and has gained trust in her foster parents.  She will now happily take treats and even become playful when her foster dad walks into the yard, but she remains quite shy of strangers and will need a patient understanding and experienced home to continue helping her to gain confidence.    \n\nThese pups have gradually overcome their reluctance to spend time inside and are working on house, crate and leash training, but it will take time for Boots to become the dog she\u2019s meant to be. She gets along well with other dogs and we would like her to have a canine buddy in her home to help with her confidence and adjustment.  She didn\u2019t pay much attention when she met a dog savvy cat in her foster home, but a feline free home would likely be best for a pup of her size. Boots has a sweet temperament and would not harm anyone, but we think it best for a timid dog with such a rough start in life to have a quiet, calm home with adults only.\n\nBoots has been spayed and is up to date with vaccinations.  She\u2019s also micro-chipped and on monthly flea/tick and heart worm preventative.  This darling girl is not a match for just any home; however, with the right person or people who are experienced and willing to give her the time, patience and love that she so deserves, she\u2019ll blossom into your devoted companion for life!   For an application, email Nancy at campellones58@gmail.com.    Please include info about your experience with dogs.  Her adoption fee is $400. \n\nLike us on Facebook at www.facebook.com/pawsclawsnewengland\nFollow/tag us on Instagram: @pawsclawsne or #pawsclawsne \n",

If you have a specific question that is not covered in the profile, please send us a message. \n\nColette is an energetic girl who takes playing with toys very seriously. We don\u2019t know her full history because she was left outside a small shelter a few years ago. She was adopted at the time but that family recently had to give her up.\n\nOur vet estimates Colette is between 9-10 years old. She just had her teeth cleaned and is in good health. She loves to go for walks, play with toys, and snuggle with her toys next to her humans.\n\nColette has been spayed, vaccinated, and microchipped. Her adoption donation is $300 which includes 6 months heartworm preventative meds, free microchip registration, and a safety harness.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Colette, please review the adoption process and fill out the application on our website: http://wsrh.com\n\nAll dogs are available until \u201cAdoption Pending\u201d is noted next to their names. WSRH DOES NOT HAVE A PUBLIC SHELTER. ALL OF OUR DOGS ARE FOSTERED IN PRIVATE HOMES. Approved adopters only will be invited to meet the dogs.",

However, Fenrir isn't a fan of cats and is selective about other dog friends, and doesn't do well with intact male dogs. He is making making progress with his house training. He would be happiest in a home with no kids under the age of 12. Fenrir's previous owner said he can be a little fear aggressive with strangers. \n\nHis minimum adoption fee is $195  plus a $12 fee, if 4 months or older, for rabies registration for McLean County residents. \n\nHe has been neutered, microchipped, vaccinated, heartworm checked, dewormed, and is on flea and heartworm preventatives.\n\nTo be considered for adoption, you must first submit the application found at: \n http://fs16.formsite.com/WishBoneCanineRescue/adoptionapplication/index.html\n\nFor information about this dog's breed(s), visit: http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/abc.htm",

I am a very handsome one year old redhead with captivating eyes. I am very intelligent as my mother was a Doberman, I can sit and shake your hand when I\u2019m offered a treat, I understand a lot of what is said to me you would be amazed. If you are not careful, I will have you trained in no time fetching my ball and getting my treats from the pantry on demand. I love to play with tennis balls and on occasion I find them to be quite tasty because I think I\u2019m still in a chewing phase, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll outgrow it since I\u2019m still a pup. I love running and I\u2019m really fast, which makes it a little difficult to put me on a leash, I get so excited I forget and try to pull you with me. But I know the right one will come along and I will have no problem walking beside a new friend. I am a great companion, if you sleep in, I sleep in whatever you do I am with you. I will follow you anywhere because I love to be with you. Sometimes, I want so much attention, that I will bark at you to play with me, especially when you have company. I am also very protective of my home and family, I have a great big bark and can scare strangers, dogs and cats away. I can\u2019t say if I like cats or not because I\u2019ve never been introduced, but I have been to doggie daycare and I love socializing and hanging out with my pals there, except the older dogs they don\u2019t appreciate me because I have so much energy they find me annoying, so I get put in time out when that happens. I\u2019m probably not the best pet for children, I like to jump and put my paws on you and that can hurt someone who is small. I would be great for someone that would want a guy like me, I\u2019m totally trainable, loveable and loyal I will be your best friend for life.\n\n\nOur organization only adopts within the United States.\n\nFaith and Hope is a multi-state rescue with locations in Texas, Washington and Oregon. All dogs are rescued from the state of Texas to and transported to our Washington and Oregon locations with placement in their adoptive families. Our $425 adoption fee includes all core vaccinations (DHPP, rabies, spay/neuter, microchip)\n\nIf interested in learning more, please email us at faithandhopeadoptions@gmail.com or fill out our online application.\n\nhttps://www.faithandhopefoundation.org/adoptionapp\n\nIf interested in learning more about our adoptable dogs and adoption process, or our foster home program, please contact us at above email.\n\nDue to the number of requests that we receive on our puppies and dogs, please be advised that all adoption applications are processed in the order received. Once we send you an application, your place in line does not get reserved until your application is returned to us.",

He has lived with other dogs & cats in the past. At this time Russell would prefer to be your one and only furry friend in the home as he isn't interested in roommates at this time. He may be able to have a few friends outside of the home and has attended dog parks in the past. This sweet guy can be nervous of new friends at times. He is searching for a calm but active dog experienced adult home. Giving this guy lots of patience will surely win him over.

I am a very handsome one year old redhead with captivating eyes. I am very intelligent as my mother was a Doberman, I can sit and shake your hand when I\u2019m offered a treat, I understand a lot of what is said to me you would be amazed. If you are not careful, I will have you trained in no time fetching my ball and getting my treats from the pantry on demand. I love to play with tennis balls and on occasion I find them to be quite tasty because I think I\u2019m still in a chewing phase, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll outgrow it since I\u2019m still a pup. I love running and I\u2019m really fast, which makes it a little difficult to put me on a leash, I get so excited I forget and try to pull you with me. But I know the right one will come along and I will have no problem walking beside a new friend. I am a great companion, if you sleep in, I sleep in whatever you do I am with you. I will follow you anywhere because I love to be with you. Sometimes, I want so much attention, that I will bark at you to play with me, especially when you have company. I am also very protective of my home and family, I have a great big bark and can scare strangers, dogs and cats away. I can\u2019t say if I like cats or not because I\u2019ve never been introduced, but I have been to doggie daycare and I love socializing and hanging out with my pals there, except the older dogs they don\u2019t appreciate me because I have so much energy they find me annoying, so I get put in time out when that happens. I\u2019m probably not the best pet for children, I like to jump and put my paws on you and that can hurt someone who is small. I would be great for someone that would want a guy like me, I\u2019m totally trainable, loveable and loyal I will be your best friend for life.\n\n\nOur organization only adopts within the United States.\n\nFaith and Hope is a multi-state rescue with locations in Texas, Washington and Oregon. All dogs are rescued from the state of Texas to and transported to our Washington and Oregon locations with placement in their adoptive families.

            "description": "Octagon was surrendered to Stockton Animal Services by her owner along with 9 siblings and her mother. The family was transferred to Valley Humane on 12/31. Octagon weighs 16.1 pounds.\n\nOctagon will be available for adoption on Tuesday 2/2. Approved applicants will have the opportunity to meet the litter and choose their puppy. The first approved adopter will have choice of 10, the second will have choice of 9, etc. These puppies are not available to adopt in pairs.\n\nThe puppies appear to be a mix of working breeds. Mom appears to be a German Shepherd Dog mix (weighing 67#). The puppies are active and friendly. They are prone to nipping and herding and will benefit from puppy socialization classes.\n\nDuring shelter-in-place, Valley Humane is conducting adoptions by appointment only. If you would like to adopt Octagon or a littermate, please complete an Adoption Inquiry Form (copy and paste the following URL into your browser), https://valleyhumane.org/adoption/adoption-inquiry-form/\n\nAn adoption counselor will reach out via telephone to conduct an adoption interview. Once you have submitted your application, stand by to answer our call! Applicants will be interviewed on Monday 2/1.\n\nIf approved, we will schedule an adoption appointment for you and your family at our facility in Pleasanton on Tuesday 2/2.\n\nhttps://valleyhumane.org/safe-adoption-guidelines/",

Zoey weighs 9.48 pounds and is estimated to be between 4 and 7 years of age. \n\nZoey is a calm and loving dog; she has bonded very quickly to one member of her foster family. When moving on to her forever home, she will need lots of reassurance, patience and love from her new caregiver. She loves cozy blankets (the more the better) and to have someone petting her. While Zoey is very easy-going when you are with her, she does have anxiety about being alone. She only likes short walks and is nervous about seeing other dogs on her walks (will growl at them). In her foster home, there are no other pets. Zoey does shed quite a bit would benefit from a short daily brushing in her forever home.\n\nThis dog has mild to moderate dental disease and would benefit from having a thorough dental cleaning with the adopter's veterinarian within the next 6 months. Optimal dental health is important to a pet as it helps to preserve their teeth and improves overall health. Brushing the teeth daily with a soft toothbrush and toothpaste designed for pets will significantly improve this dog's dental health and possibly her general health in the future.\n\nDuring shelter-in-place, Valley Humane is conducting adoptions by appointment only. If you would like to adopt Zoey, please complete an Adoption Inquiry Form (copy and paste the following URL into your browser), https://valleyhumane.org/adoption/adoption-inquiry-form/\n\nAn adoption counselor will reach out via telephone to conduct an adoption interview. Once you have submitted your application, stand by to answer our call! Animals posted to the website are ready to go home and applicants are typically called the same day as the Inquiry Form is received.\n\nIf approved, we will schedule an adoption appointment for you, your family and the animal at our facility in Pleasanton.\n\nhttps://valleyhumane.org/safe-adoption-guidelines/",

She will show you the same amount of energy that you show her. If you're going on a walk, petting her, or playing with her, she gets super excited and energetic. She can also be very gentle and calm. If you work/study from home, she will sit quietly at your feet or near your desk and stay very calm and quiet. She's a wonderful companion and very easy to take care of! \n\nFor more info, or to virtually meet her, contact claudiafernandezg26@gmail.com.",

He will take all the pets and scratches you will give him, follow you, and look adoringly at you in the hope of treats. So far Domino's energy level is medium. He has many moments of calm observation of his new surroundings, followed by adorable bursts of energy when he wants to play. He loves toys, especially his stuffed hedgehog. He is just happy to be where you are and would love to snuggle on the couch!\n\nDomino came to HRA as a stray so there isn't much known about his background. We have two cats that he seems interested in, but we are keeping him on a leash and separate from them for now. He walks pretty well on a leash, but he would love to work on training basics, like stay, heel, come, lay down etc., with his new family. He pretty much has sit, though sometimes it takes him a while, but he is much quicker about it if treats are involved! \n\nDomino is in good health and estimated to be around 5 years old and 66 pounds. He was just neutered and had his rear dewclaws removed so will be wearing a cone for about a week. He seems to be a bit sensitive to some sounds, but could also just need some time to adjust to his new surroundings. For the most part he's happy to relax near you, and has soft, cute little snores! We already adore this sweet, handsome guy, and can't wait for him to find his forever family and home. \n\nLet us know if you are interested and want to set up a virtual meet and greet contact JwLyndsey@gmail.com.",

            "description": "Hey there, the name's Scarlett. Are you ready to spice up your life by adopting me? My mom came to HALO all the way from Puerto Penasco, Mexico where she gave birth to me and my 6 siblings in a foster home. We got so lucky! After we were old enough for adoption, a loving family came and snatched me up-- We lived together for just under a year when unfortunately, they had to surrender me. I then came back to HALO, where they placed me into a foster home where I could get a refresher course on basic obedience, and confidence-- What a cool experience! Normally, I'm a little nervous when meeting new dogs, and people; Especially if we've never met them before, but with patience, calmness, and confidence-- I will be your best friend whether you like it or not. The foster dog was super friendly, social, and playful, and we got along right away. I do get very nervous around children so I will need an adult only home please, but I do know how to behave myself in public as long as nobody startles me and comes up from where I can't see them. I do best with confident, experienced dog handlers ideally who have had experience with a shelter pup like me previously; and I'll need to warm up to the home before we go on any adventures outside of it, if that's alright. I am always down to put in some repetitions in the back yard, and love to walk on leash and try and learn new things for the right price. I'd love a family who is a ready to give me the guidance and knowledge I need to become the best dog I can be. Raising a pretty young lady is no joke! I hope I get to meet you soon and we will be a perfect match.",

I love all people, even kids. I am also very good with bigger dogs, but not so much with the littles! The 3 dogs in my foster home aren't very welcoming, and it sort of hurts my feelings, but I just continue to \"kill them with kindness\"! I do chase kitties, which I enjoy, but would probably not work out so well for a forever home. I have never been allowed to live inside the home until now, so I am still \"learning the ropes\" and that there are no bathrooms INSIDE the home for me to use. I am a smart boy, though, so I am learning quickly! My foster mom is also trying to get me used to the crate. I don't like it, because I want to be with everyone else in the home! But, I'll get used to it. I LOVE to go on walks! I like to pretend I am a sled dog in a race! However, my foster mom says that this is bad behavior. She is showing me the right way to walk on the leash. Like I said, I am a SMART boy, so I am learning very quickly! Check out videos in my bio to see the progress! If you like what you see, please fill out an application so we can meet! I'm sure you will love me almost as much as I love you!",

He has an endless amount of kisses to give and his favorite spot is snuggled up completely underneath a blanket. He is the ultimate lap dog and doesn't mind being held either. Ruben is very playful and knows how to tell you when he wants to play. He likes to be the center of attention and can play a bit rough so would probably do better with no children or older kids. He got along with our dogs great and loves to rough house with them. He is great on a leash, slept quietly in his crate at night, and is very treat motivated. This little guy has a lot of love to give and we can't wait to see him in his very own home!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

We do not know her exact breed but based on looks, collie/beagle is our best guess. Abilene is dog friendly, hasn't met cats, and would be fine in a home with respectful children. She hasn't met kids in our care, so this is based on temperament alone. Abilene is in boarding so we cannot say whether or not she is house broken. She is a very sweet girl. Her ears are floppy despite her adorable photo. Abilene's adoption fee is $250. This includes her spay, microchip, vaccines, heart worm test (negative), flea/tick/heart worm prevention, and dewormer. If you are interested in adoption, please fill out an adoption application at www.pawsandprayers.org as it's the first step in our adoption process before a meet is arranged.",

I love to play outside, and I listen to my foster mom when she calls me. My foster mom says I am a silly boy because when I am running outside, I hop like a deer. I love my human so much that I like to jump up and give kisses. I do get excited when I am playing and can be a little rough. I love kids so much that the little ones may fall to the floor with me and get lots of kisses. I like the big kids because they can catch me if I jump on them. Oh, in case you are wondering, I do not like cats. I do need a little bit of training on being calmer. I am very smart and very attentive. I am kenneled trained and my foster mom leaves the door open for me when she is around. When she leaves it\u2019s party time for me and the trash.

So now I'm here waiting for a fun new family to adopt me and love me forever!\n\nSince I'm a younger guy I will need you to teach me all of the things a good doggie should know for when I grow up!  Before I go to my new home I will be up to date on vaccinations, neutered, and I will also have a microchip.  All I need now is someone like YOU to take me home!!\n\nIf you're looking for a new furry family member and think I might be the boy for you, please stop by the shelter and spend some time getting to know me!",

She enjoys running with other dogs at the park until it\u2019s naptime. She loves to rest on soft pillows and blankets and blissfully sleeps on a warm lap if she can find one. She is house-trained and benefits from a consistent schedule. Put her to work or give her a project and she will love it. She needs some time to warm up to new people, but once she does, she\u2019s a total cuddlebug. Not sure how she is with children or cats in the home but she may thrive in the company of another dog. \n\nAre you interested in rescuing Leila - please email us at VegasRootsRescue@gmail.com",

Please visit http://www.caninelifeline.org/adoption-process/ for more information about our adoption process and to submit an online application.\n\nNadia is a very friendly and outgoing 3 year-old All-American mutt who looks like she might have some Retriever, Shepherd, and Terrier in her family tree. She was adopted from a county dog shelter and was in her home for several years before being recently returned because she chased the mailman. Yes, that is really what the owner told the shelter. We don't know what type of living arrangements she had in her previous home or whether she was allowed to run loose but that seems likely. Nadia is going to need a new home where she will have a yard with a secure aboveground fence to keep her safe at home or be kept on a leash at all times so she doesn't get herself into trouble. This girl is very friendly with other dogs so would enjoy having a canine buddy in her new home. She has had excellent crate manners in her foster home and may be housetrained too although we can't guarantee it. Nadia does like to pull on the leash so is going to need some work in that area. Walking her with a harness as she works on her leash skills will be very helpful and make walks much more enjoyable. She's got the stamina to keep up with the big dogs so would make a great walking, jogging, or hiking buddy for her new family. Nadia will eagerly sit for a treat and may know more commands that we haven't discovered yet. There are no cats in Nadia's foster home so we don't know how she would be living with kitties. Nadia weighs about 30 pounds and her adoption fee is $325. She's spayed, heartworm negative and on monthly preventative, up to date on vaccinations including bivalent canine influenza, wormed, on flea and tick preventative, and microchipped. As part of the adoption process, all adopters must commit to a two-week adjustment period to make sure it's a great match before the adoption is finalized. Please email info@caninelifeline.org if you're interested in Nadia. An approved application is required before we schedule meets with any of our dogs. Please note that we don't place our dogs in homes with children under 7 years of age. We correspond via email so please check your junkmail or spam folder to make sure our reply hasn't landed in there. Please visit our website at www.caninelifeline.org to see more photos of Nadia and to submit an online application if you live in Northeast OH.",

            "description": "~Maggie is a sweet, cuddly pup who lovessss toys! She is a smart girl who has done well with house-training and learning better manners, like not jumping up when she's excited. She would benefit from continued training with her forever family. After burning up some energy chasing her ball around the yard, playing with a toy, or romping around with the resident dog, she will snuggle with you on the couch.\n\nMaggie walks well on a leash and gets along with the resident dog, but does need to be fed separately. She also is still learning how to share toys. For this reason, we think she would be happy as an only dog or with another friendly dog and an experienced family. Maggie shows too much interest in cats, so a cat-free house would be best.\n\nMaggie seems to do well with young children and could fit in with any family or household. She would benefit from a house with a fenced yard but would do equally well in a household with an active lifestyle. Maggie is about 2 years old, 50 lb, and our best guess is a lab/pittie mix.\n\nPlease email us at AlmostHome4Dogs@yahoo.com to find out if Maggie is the right one for you! (Local adoptions preferred - Philadelphia and tri-state area [South Jersey and northern Delaware] only.)\n\nPLEASE READ BEFORE CONTACTING US!\nWe are NOT a shelter: All of our dogs live in private homes with foster families. Come and meet the Almost Home dogs and their fosters at our Meet & Greet events, where you can learn more about our wonderful dogs from the people who live with them, find out which dogs are on their way and when they'll arrive, and fill out an application to adopt or foster.\n\nWe cannot adopt to homes where electric-shock fencing systems or training collars are used. For more information on the dangers of electric-shock collars, please visit banshockcollars.ca/studies.php and http://www.hollysden.com/say_no_to_shock.htm (scroll down and click on the \"Invisible Fencing Systems\" link).\n\nWe do not have an online adoption application; to request an application, e-mail us at AlmostHome4Dogs@yahoo.com. To speed e-mail processing time, be sure to note the name of the dog you are inquiring about in the Subject line. For Meet & Greet times and locations, visit our home page, where you also will find information on our adoption process and fees.\n\nFOSTER FAMILIES ARE LIFESAVERS!! Can you open your heart and home for a few weeks to homeless shelter dog? Remember, by fostering a dog, you save TWO lives - that of your foster dog, and that of the dog who takes his place in the shelter! Come to a Meet & Greet and find out if fostering is for you - there's no reward quite like the feeling that you've saved a life ... or two!",

            "description": "Liam is a 5-8 pound 2-month-old Goldendoodle/Coonhound mix and is already extremely active. He loves to jump and climb and is only concerned with when he will get his treats. Liam is already showing signs of high intelligence and would thrive with a family ready to train him to grow up to be a wonderful family member. When he arrived with his foster mom he had a broken tail that has healed and will be a little crooked, but it only adds character to his blooming personality. Liam will probably grow to be 55-65 pounds and has been fostered with his littermates, a small dog, and a large dog.  His adoption fee is $400.00.\n\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

If you want to know more about Monty, please complete a survey at https://furkids.org/dog-adoptions/application. Puppies require a lot of time and commitment. Please make sure your schedule can accommodate a puppy as it will be a member of your family for the next 10 to 15 years. At this time, meeting our dogs is by appointment only. After submitting a survey, an adoption counselor will contact you to give you more information about the dog you are interested in adopting and to arrange for you to meet the dog. Must be at least 21 years of age to adopt.",

            "description": "Holly is a 2 year old female terrier mix.  She looks just like a large Miniature Pinscher.  She has a thick black coat with tan markings and is solid muscle weighing 35 pounds.  Holly was pulled from our local shelter after being there over 2 months.  She was very afraid and took a long time to decompress there. So we pulled her out to help her continue to become more comfortable and confident with the world.  And she is already much more social and loving!  \n\nOnce Holly gets to know you and is ok with her environment she is playful and loving.  She enjoys attention and does well walking on a leash.  Holly has some scarring on her back (can see where white hair is growing in) that we don\u2019t know what happened.  She can be sensitive to being touched there so we are working on that.  Holly got along well with the other dogs she was tested with and we think she would do better in a home without children or children over 15.  \n\nHolly will require a fenced in yard or be on a leash when outside \u2013 terriers can be fast runners and hard to catch!!  We have started on her crate training.  Holly is up to date on her vet care, will be spayed prior to adoption, heartworm negative and is microchipped.  She is on heartworm and flea/tick prevention.  A spunky dog with a big heart, that is Miss Holly in a nutshell!\n\nAll HSWA dogs are either at our Dog Adoption Facility or in foster homes. All dogs require an appointment to meet.  Please call us at 205-554-0011 or email humaneswa@yahoo.com to request an appointment to see the dog/puppy and to check availability.\n\nVisit us on Facebook! www.facebook.com/humaneswa\n\nOur adoption fee is $75.  Read more information on our adoption process at www.humanesocietyofwa.org/howtoadopt.html.  Then, if you feel your home might be the right forever home and you would like to adopt a dog, submit an online adoption application. The online applications may not work on mobile devices. If the online application does not work on your device, look to the right side of the forms page for a downloadable .PDF copy of the application.",

He loves to play with his squeaky toys and relax on his soft blankets. Carl is a pretty relaxed pup and loves neck and belly rubs and will kiss his humans until he falls asleep. He will probably grow to be 55-65 pounds and has been fostered with his littermates, a large dog, and a small dog.  His adoption fee is $400.00.\n\n\nTo adopt this pet, please visit https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs come spayed or neutered, fully up to date on vaccinations, including rabies (if age appropriate) and bordetella, are microchipped, heartworm negative, current on flea/tick and heartworm prevention, dewormed, and treated for any ailments found upon veterinary examination. The adoption fee covers a portion of these services, and makes it possible for us to continue rescuing animals.  \n\nFor more information on the adoption fees and the adoption process, please complete our adoption application here: https://www.louieslegacy.org/adopt - an application allows us to get to know your family better so we can assess whether the animal you are interested in is a good match for your home. An application does not obligate you to adopt. Please understand that due to the volume of applications some animals receive, we are unable to contact all applicants. If your application is considered a good fit for the dog you are interested in, or even a different pet, a volunteer will give you a call as soon as possible.  \n\nWe are a foster based rescue and do not have a shelter location where dogs can be seen during the week. Please see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/LouiesLegacy for our weekly adoption album if you are interested in meeting a dog in person. Not all animals attend every adoption event, please check our Facebook page for animal event times and locations before you make a trip to meet a specific animal.\n\nThanks so much for caring about a needy animal!",

Her foster family said that she is doing great with her potty training. She is learning to play with toys. She loves to play catch and snuggle. She is great with her foster families children and dog too. \n\nPuppies have special needs and require a home where there will be someone available to care for, socialize, and train them during the day. If your family is away from the home for several hours at a time, please consider adopting a teenager or adult dog.\n\nOur standard adoption fees are as follows $400 for puppies up to 12 months, $300 for adults, and $200 for seniors 7yrs and up with cash or check. It includes spay/neuter, age appropriate vaccinations, fecal testing, deworming, flea and tick preventative, heartworm preventative, free vet visit at one of our participating vets, and micro-chipping.\n\nWe must have an application, conduct a phone interview, and meet your entire family to approve an adoption. Please visit www.rescuedrascalsil.org for an application. \n\nPlease note that the breeds and sizes posted in this biography are educated best guesses and are not guaranteed.",

Tiger is a very big girl and is on a diet and needs a structured exercise program and someone that will stick to her diet. She would probably make a good walking partner with a good strong leash and harness because if she saw a cat, she would take off and she is very, very strong.  Tiger loves people and is good with other dogs. She has a sweet heart. She loves children.  She must remain in Kentucky until the court case is resolved.

            "description": "Bento boy is a 1 1/2 year old Shepherd/Heeler mix that is, for lack of a better word, kind of... dopey. He's ready for a home that will keep him forever instead of passing him around ,rehoming and taking him to the shelter. Bento is a beautiful chestnut red color with some cute red ticking on his chest and feet.  He weighs upwards of 65lbs, so is a lot of dog. \n\nHe hasn't had a lot of consistency in his life but has still managed to come out the other side of his misfortunes polite, slightly aloof (true to his breeds), and loveable. Upon first meeting him, he looks you up and down and waits for you to make the first move. Given the invitation, he will absolutely climb up on your lap for a cuddle. Once he is comfortable, he loves to let loose by running and stretching his long legs, and playing. Bento knows how to sit but since he hasn't had the kind of stability young working breeds crave, hasn't reached his full potential. We know he could learn all kinds of tricks though! He has been around other dogs and does best with non dominant ones. If his adopters have children, they should be above 8 years old because of Bento's size and herding tendencies. \n\nThis sweet boy is past the crazy puppy age but still in his prime. Can you give him the home he deserves? \n\nBenny Boy is neutered, microchipped, and up to date on rabies, distemper/parvo, and bordatella vaccine. He is heartworm negative and on flea/tick/heartworm prevention.",

            "description": "This fine lady is Lana, a 5-6 year old American bulldog mix.  She has a smooth white coat with black markings and the soft muzzle like a bulldog or boxer mix.  Lana is a big girl who only weighs 51 pounds now cause she is on the thin side but we hope to get her up to around 55-60 pounds on that frame.  Lana was pulled from our local animal shelter where she had been picked up as a stray by Animal Control and after several weeks down there no one came to claim her.  \n\nLana is a smart, happy, social dog.  She loves to play, loves to be active and loves to go for walks.  We do see that she is a fence jumper/climber so she will need a privacy fence or always be walked on a leash (NOT an outside runner/trolley).  She may have some hound in her that wants to check out what is on the other side of the fence!  \n\nLana got along well with the other dogs she has been tested with and should be fine with children 12 and older, not young ones that she may bump over by accident.  We have started on her crate training.  Lana is up to date on her vet care, spayed, heartworm negative and is microchipped.  She is on heartworm and flea/tick prevention.  So if you are looking for an active dog to work out with, Lana is the one for you!!\n\n\nAll HSWA dogs are either at our Dog Adoption Facility or in foster homes. All dogs require an appointment to meet.  Please call us at 205-554-0011 or email humaneswa@yahoo.com to request an appointment to see the dog/puppy and to check availability.\n\nVisit us on Facebook! www.facebook.com/humaneswa\n\nOur adoption fee is $75.  Read more information on our adoption process at www.humanesocietyofwa.org/howtoadopt.html.  Then, if you feel your home might be the right forever home and you would like to adopt a dog, submit an online adoption application. The online applications may not work on mobile devices. If the online application does not work on your device, look to the right side of the forms page for a downloadable .PDF copy of the application.",

I'm Bruce, and I like everyone to know me! I have a HUGE tongue to give big puppy kisses! I like to be near my humans, and lean into them for love. Also, it helps me balance. I have cerebral hypoplasia, which is just a fancy way of saying I'm a little uncoordinated, but I don't know any different! My mom probably got sick before I was born, so the part of my brain stem that coordinates my movement got the short end of the stick. But I don't even notice! Sometimes I trip, or walk on my front wrists, but I get around just fine! I love to fetch toys, go for walk, and run around with my foster brother! And don't worry about stairs, those are fine too!\nI'm still young and working on my manners, but I ALWAYS respect the word \"no\"! I know how to sit and come (I do better for treats), and kennel up! I don't really enjoy my kennel so my foster mom puts treats in to get me to go in, and some after I'm in. I only whine for a few minutes, then I get it...it's time to settle. Oh and did I mention I'm housebroken?! Yep. I know my business is to be done outside only!\nI'm pretty strong and still working on leash manners so my foster mom uses a harness when walking and it works great! Maybe helps keep my gait straighter too. My foster mom also thinks that once I'm neutered (soon!) I won't need to smell and pee so much on walks. I do like my walks :)\nI adore kids too! But since I'm a little clumsy and kind of a big boy, I probably wouldn't be a very good fit in a house with small kids...I might accidentally knock them over!\nI play well with others! I like to sniff, but then it's all play. I love my foster brother! He's big like me. I also try to play with kitties...they don't like it, which gets me more excited. I do ok with my fellow kitties now but I'm supervised and they are really dog savvy.\nI really just want a forever home with human(s) who will let me love them! I have so much love to give and am an all around wonderful guy! Just look at my smile! I promise I will bring you so much joy with my snuggles, kisses and play!\n\nAn adoption application is the best way to show your interest in an animal.

We are not sure what he is mixed with because he is still young (acts just like a puppy) and is already around 70 lbs.  He gets along well with other dogs.  We think he would hurt a cat trying to play with it.  He LOVES to run and play!  \n\nCOMPLETED APPLICATIONS TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER INQUIRIES!
