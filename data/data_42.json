            "description": "Little Benji is a 12 year old mixed terrier breed in need of a understanding and loving forever home. Benji is currently living out his golden years here when he should be in a warm comfy bed in his very own home surrounded by a forever family who loves him unconditionally. Benji has Congestive Heart Failure with a grade 4 heart murmur. He also has some tracheal damage as well. Both cause him to cough often. He is on chronic medications for his heart condition and will require them long term for comfort and continuity of care. He is lively, spunky and enjoys the company of other dogs. He also loves being carried around like the prince he is.\n\nTo view the adoptable dogs at our shelter, you must fill out an adoption application found on our website. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are showing dogs on an appointment only basis. Please understand that we are receiving a high volume of applications at this time and are doing our best to address as many as we can. Please be patient. Thank you.\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs is $250. Aside from the shelter, food and water, exercise and compassion they receive while in our care, this also includes veterinary services such as Rabies, Distemper+Lepto, Bordetella, H3N2/H3N8 Influenza, heartworm testing, fecal exams, preventions and deworming medications. Spays/Neuters are also included as part of the adoption fee as is microchipping. \nPuppies under the age of 6 months have an adoption fee of $350. The veterinary services rendered include puppies first round of vaccines, fecal exams, deworming medications, preventions, and microchipping. Our facility spays and neuters dogs at 6 months of age. If the puppy is adopted prior to his, or her prescheduled surgery date, a $200 spay/neuter deposit will be taken on the day of adoption. This deposit it refundable and will be returned to the adopter once proof of the procedure is returned to the shelter. \nCOVID-19 NOTE: Please understand that we are looking for forever home for our pets. We understand that many people have a lot of time on their hands during the COVID-19 pandemic, so this may seem like an ideal time to bring home a new pet. Please be sure you are prepared to give your new pet his, or her forever home once our lives go back to normal. They deserve it. Thank you and stay safe.",

He took her in and nursed her back to health. She has always been very skittish and she actually screamed at times when he would approach... a clear sign of abuse or no socialization. At 18, the young man was just not equipped to give her what she needs. While she was with him, she had an accidental fall between the stairs leading to his second floor apartment and her eye popped out of socket. She was rushed to the ER clinic where they reinserted the eye, but she is blind in that eye. An xray showed also that she broke a rib... BUT the most alarming was that she also had two broken ribs that were healing. This girl has been through so much. She's currently at our vet for spaying, vaccinations, heartworm/fecal testing, etc. When she returns to us, we will work assess her temperament and behavior further before placing her for adoption.\n\nNOT TAKING APPLICATIONS: We are not taking applications yet. We will post when s(he) is ready for adoption. In the interest of fairness, EARLY application submissions will NOT be considered. Please note we cannot respond to messages/emails, etc., on dogs that are NOT yet available for adoption. Please wait until the dog is available for adoption.

He original came to us with his mom and other brother in 2019. He was then adopted out to a home with another dog. He is just not doing well with the other dog. He will be ok at times but them he acts out towards that other dog. He turns his frustration into attacking the other dog. He will need an owner that will correct this behavior. We suggest that is an only dog. If someone with another dog is interested we would consider it however, he can be aggressive with other dogs at times, so his new owner needs to make sure they set boundaries, for him.\n\nHe is going to need an experience dog owner, that is will to put the time into to training and work on this behavioral issues. We have a trainer lined up that the adopter will be working with. We used this trainer and balanced training method with his brother and had success.\n\nHe is no cats, as he wants to do is chase them. He is no kids under 15, as he does not like to be startled when he is sleeping.\n\nHe does tend to bark for the first 10 minutes when in his crate or left alone at the house but then does settle in. He also likes to bark while watching out the window when people go by, (we will work with the trainer on this behavior to fix it, so it does not turn into anxiety or aggression).\n\nHe is really a nice boy and loves attention from his human, but needs someone that will reinforce boundaries. He is going to be a project dog for the first few months and will need constant training reminds throughout his entire life.\n\nHe is crate trained and is house broke.\n\nThis animal is current on all age appropriate vaccines, dewormed, microchipped, and spayed/neutered or go home with certificate IF too young to be done. They have also been given flea prevention. Adoption fee is $250.00 If you are interested in adopting this pet please fill out an application.\n\nhttp://www.ajssearchandrescue.org/adoption-application",

He insists on walking with a stuffed animal so that he can show off his newly learned walking skills. Ruger has spread the word that he loves to cuddle and have his humans pet him. Ruger can self-entertain with toys and bones, and he takes his treats gently. Once he is comfortable with his surroundings, he is quite a gentle soul. As always, please bring in any other dogs in the home to meet with Ruger before adoption.",

I may not live in an enchanted castle, but I would love to live in a real home with a real family. I may look big and tough, but am as gentle as can be and would do great in a home that has children. I don't enjoy being alone, and if left in a yard alone I may find ways to go on adventures on my own. I can't wait for the day that I am able to be curled up next to you chewing on a bone while you're reading a book or watching the news. Please be my guest and live the tale as old as time with me. We can live happily ever after!",

He loves to go out for walks and is very excited about it. We have found that a harness helps to contain some of his enthusiasm. He will do best in a home where his owners have some dog experience. Rico could go to a home with older kids who are respectful and comfortable around dogs. Rico also enjoys playing with other dogs but one who will be able to manage his gusto. Rico is ready to start his new life. To meet Rico, call 513-735-2299 to schedule an appointment.",

I came to the Humane Society with a torn ACL, but I am healing nicely! I'm looking for the perfect forever home where I can fully heal from my injury and fully express my goofy personality!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting me, please complete an online application at https://form.jotform.com/201174641622144.",

Latifah does well with my dogs and she will sometimes engage in a game of chase in my fenced backyard , she also enjoys playing with toys especially the ones that squeak. She also enjoys marrow bones and bully sticks. Latifah is doing well with her housetraining with being let out on a schedule along with her crate training , She does need to be on 2 meds a day one of them helps with this.. Latifah walks nice on the leash and rides nice in the car. She is used to sleeping in my room at night next to my bed on a nice soft dog bed. Latifah is a older gal who is pretty mellow who enjoys being outside with me when the weather is nice whether it is hanging outside with me in my fenced backyard, engaging in a game of chase with her canine buddies or going for a easy going shorter walk. Latifah wants to be by her person as much as possible and she will let you know if she thinks you are not done petting her by gently nudging your hand. Latifah may have some bumps, some weakness in her back legs but she Loves with her whole heart and to see the spark in her eyes, the joy in her step, her little Dobie tail wag is a feeling that just warms your heart! Who is ready to Welcome Latifah into your home and heart and treat her like the Queen she is meant to be!\n\nFROM OUR VET:\n\nHello! I have some special health needs, but am still considered adoptable.\n\nAs expected for a senior gal, I have some arthritis in my hips and spine. I might need NSAID pain management in the future, but for now am on a lifelong regimen on a high quality joint supplement and Gabapentin (for pain). I have some cloudy eyes diagnosed as \"nuclear sclerosis\" - there is no change to my vision and is simply a normal change due to aging. I have several lumps and bumps, but they have all been documented and evaluated by the SHH Vet and are benign. My adopters should continue to monitor development of any future masses and have them tested to ensure they aren't concerning. A Grade 2 (out of 6) heart murmur was found during an exam; Xrays were taken and evaluated by a cardiologist. Since there are no changes to my heart/lungs, no further workup is needed and it's simply something to be aware of. Lastly, I do experience some urinary incontinence or \"leaking\". It is well controlled on a medication called Proin that I receive twice daily, so I should remain on this lifelong as well.",

            "description": "STAR is a foster-based rescue. All our rescue animals stay in foster homes until adoption. We do not have a central facility. If you want to meet any of our adoptables please submit an application.\n\nHi! My name is Snowball! I was born on November 10th and I am on the hunt for my forever home! I am happy, playful and loving life! I LOVE everyone I meet!\n\nI get along and have been raised with other dogs and cats and I love them all! I think playing is so much fun and I am very smart and doing good on crate training so far. I probably will grow to be about 40-45lbs or so just like my mom. I also really like to snuggle . Im up for whatever adventure comes my way and I like to give kisses! If you are interested in meeting a little sweetie like me, please fill out an application asap! www.savingtailsanimalrescue.org\n\nMy adoption fee is $300 plus a $50 refundable deposit after I am spayed. I will come up to date on all of my betting, microchipped, and I will come with some food, treats, toys, leash and collar. Thank you for considering me!\n\nAll STAR animals come vetted, Up to Date (UTD) on age appropriate shots and testing, spay and neutered (if of age,) and microchipped.\n\nAGE DISCLAIMER:\nUnfortunately, most of the orphaned animals that come into our rescue looking for homes don't bring birth certificates. Sometimes we know our pets' ages. Sometimes we don't. So we make our best guess based on the condition of their teeth and the veterinarians best guess.\nBREED DISCLAIMER:\nVisual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality,\nnot\nby breed label .\nMicrochips:\nFor the safety of our dogs and peace of mind of our fosters and adopters, STAR microchips all dogs prior to adoption with Petlink Microchips. Please understand that all dogs MUST still wear a collar with ID tags (which include your current information) AT ALL TIMES. Please remember, our foster dogs are extremely important to us-- we will always take any of our dogs back, if for any reason you can't keep your adopted dog. Never surrender him/her to a shelter!",

First, dogs just want to be happy and feel loved. Living inside and being a part of the family is really important to us. A lot of the things you need as humans to stay happy and healthy, us dogs need too. We depend on you for things like vet visits, nutritious food, clean water, social and play time with people and other pets, training classes, toys, and of course, lots of love and attention! Regular baths, nail trims and grooming help us to look and feel our best, while monthly flea and heartworm prevention help us to stay healthy. Did you know that depending on our size and breed, dogs can live up to 20 years? Just think of the wonderful life we could have together!",

Charlie is just looking for love and attention all of the time and a home where someone is at home the majority of most days would be best for him. If interested in Charlie, please email the canine department at Jrein@carrollcountymd.gov to request an application for adoption be sent to you which is required.

He originally came to us from Tennessee at the beginning of December and he was initially adopted but, was returned due to some behavioral concerns.\nYou see, Johnny likes to jump a lot and he can exhibit some mild aggressive outbursts. It\u2019s likely because he\u2019s such an energetic and hardworking breed.  \nIt\u2019s in his best interest to find a home that has a lot of land for him to run and be busy. He also needs a family that is willing to get him some proper training so that he can be his best self. We recommend that his new home have no children under 15. \nAlthough Johnny has room to improve, he\u2019s otherwise super smart and we think he\u2019d learn new behaviors quickly. He just needs to be given a chance in the right home with the right people.",

Sofie Mae began the 'doxy-moxie slow kill method' of treatment with 30 days of doxycycline and monthly doses of moxidectin. The 30 days of doxy has ended and she will receive her 4th dose of moxi in Feb. It is recommended that Sofie be maintained on ProHeart 6, which is a once every six month injection of moxidectin heartworm treatment/prevention. She is an otherwise healthy and happy dog. She is a good service dog prospect. Sofie Mae's adoption fee is a donation to the rescue in the amount of $450.",

She has been returned to us because the original adopter is now battling cancer and downsizing their home from 5 acres to a motor home. She is good with dogs, and children. She is timid and would probably do well with cats. She is house trained but needs work on manners as she likes to place her paws on counters. She is a fast learner and she loves to sleep in the room with you. She is scared of new dogs at first but as long as they respect her space, she is fine. She will cower in a corner or tuck her tail between her legs when they get in her face but she will lift her lips a little to warn them to back up. Currently she is being fostered with 6 dogs and all are co-habitating well. They respect her and therefore no issues.Please apply at muttsandrunts.org/application",

Ryder is a 5 month old terrier/whippet mix who is neutered, up to date on vaccines, and heartworm tested negative. Ryder is a bit of a shy guy but he\u2019s lived a pretty sheltered life until now. Once he is comfortable and out of his shell, look out! He is is the most loving and playful dog! Ryder loves to get the \"zoomies\" and he is always up for little walk or snuggle time. We think he needs a home with kids a little older (7+) as he is still learning about the world. Ryder also needs a home where he is the only dog. If you\u2019re interested in adding Ryder to your family, please go to our website and fill out an adoption application. Once received, a staff member will be in touch.",

Milo is a beautiful white and brown mixed dog weighing 69 pounds. We aren't positive what his breed is, but he is very handsome. Milo is a lover and knows about to sit when told. He loves treats and to cuddle with you. Milo will need to be in a home where he can be the only dog or a dog his size or larger(he is not aggressive but he plays rough) and have a fenced in yard where he can run and play. He has a little separation anxiety, so a home where someone will be there most of the time with him. Milo is looking for his perfect forever home, he is neutered and microchipped. His fee is $200.00 with an approved application. He isn't good with cats, too interested, wants to chase them.If interested in adopting a pet from our shelter, please click on one of the following links which will take you to our adoption application.

These boys are a bonded pair of Siberian Husky mixes that must be adopted together. They are 3 years old, weighing around 55 lbs and they do well with other dogs. Yippee! We would say they could live with teens 13+ and would just love playing ball in the yard and going on trail hikes especially in the snow. They do have a decent energy level so they will need a lot of physical activity. They are also EXTREMELY intelligent which comes naturally with the breed. This also makes them sneaky at times so you will need to Husky proof your house and they definitely, as we suggest to all adopters, should go through a basic obedience course to start for these two!\n\nThey are such love bugs and I can see them trying to be 55lb lap dogs as well. They should not be left alone for too long because even though they have each other, they are very social and need that interaction with their human(s). Playtime is great for them. They know 'sit', well at least Mr. Claus does, but like I said these two are HIGHLY intelligent as well as super  \n food-motivated, making training so much easier. \n\nSo Holiday is wearing the red collar right now and Mr. Claus is wearing the green. These boys are fun-loving, adventure-ready, affectionate pups looking for their waggly ever after! If you are interested in meeting these studs or would like more info please email canines@manchesteranimalshelter.org\n\n\n\nAdoption fee is based on age:\nPuppies 8 weeks through 7 months are $400\nDogs 8 months through 7 years are $325\nSenior dogs over 8 years are $125 \nSeniors for Seniors (Seniors 65+ dogs as week over 8 years): $75\n\nAll adoptable dogs are spayed and neutered, have age and time appropriate vaccines, microchipped and heartworm tested. Other medical care provided might include treatments for fleas, ear mites, dental work or infections or other medical conditions. Additional vaccinations and medical care (including puppies Rabies shots if adopted at under 12 weeks of age) will be the responsibility of the adopter.\n\nIf you have questions you can call our office at 603.628.3544. To request an application, please email canines@manchesteranimalshelter.org\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: As with all of our dogs, we strongly recommend obedience classes for new owner and dog to create a life-long bond with the adopted dog based on trust, respect, and rewarding training experiences. Our shelter dogs are strays and we observe and assess their behavior at the shelter which may be somewhat different in a home environment.",

Learn more on our website! \n\nHope to see you soon! \n\nWhat breed am I? Mixed mutt!

Adoption donations are to be made via cash, and credit/debit card. There is a $5 fee to run cards.\n\nPlease remember to bring a collar and leash (non-retractable) with you the day of the adoption. Note: Martingale collars and slip leads are strongly recommended.\n\nDue to COVID19, we aren't having as many open, public adoption events.  Current schedule is pre-determined meet and greet appointments are Wednesday evenings and on Saturdays. \nOur adoption center is located at 3602 Lafayette Blvd, Suite 102, Fredericksburg, VA 22408. It's important that you keep an eye on your emails for any changes or updates during the adoption process.\n\nVisit our website for an application to adopt. \nhttps://www.olddominionhumanesociety.org/adoption-application\n\nOld Dominion Humane Society is a volunteer based organization. We are run completely by volunteers, who also have full time jobs, so we appreciate your patience.

She is a complete snuggle bug and would do well with both adults and children. She absolutely adores her 75lb foster brother and size does not intimidate her! She is already a very active pup, so a fenced in yard is required. A home with another dog would be ideal. She is almost completely house trained, with just a few accidents per week. She is learning and growing more everyday and we are so impressed with her progress.\n\n1st round of shots scheduled for 1/20/21 and she will be available in about 3 weeks after that! Holly will make an amazing addition to the right family!\n\nAdoption fee $250\n\nHome visit and vet reference required.\n\nPlease apply to start the approval process.",

She has been such a sweet girl and seems to be very loving. She does like to jump up on people to receive pets and she is a big fan of belly rubs. She will let out little satisfied grunts while she is being petted. Neveah did great meeting new dogs here at the shelter. She approached them with a relaxed posture and her tail wagging. After exchanging sniffs, she was ready to play. Another fixed female dog barked and lunged towards Neveah and she took it well. She backed away from the other dog and did not show any signs of aggression. When walked through our cat room, Neveah sniffed at cats in their kennels, but did not show any reaction.",

Ellie seems to be a little head-shy and would probably do best in a home without young kids because of that. She loves attention and will duck her head into your hand when she is ready for some love, but she gets a little anxious when you go to put a leash on her. Ellie seems to be a pretty mellow and low key dog that is just looking for a loving and calm home! If you would like to meet her give us a call!",

            "description": "Morgan is a diamond in the rough! Once this sweet girl with the pouty lip learns to trust you, it is all tail wags and kisses! Morgan came to us recently as a stray. In her time spent at our shelter, she has been pretty terrified. She has bonded with quite a few staff members that care for her daily, but can still take a bit of time to warm up to new people. Morgan can be won over with snacks, baby talk, and patient people that understand she takes her time to get to know you. Fast movements tend to startle Morgan, so we think she'd do best in a home without small children. \n\nIf you're interested in meeting or adopting Morgan, please complete an application at: inapl.org/adoption-application. Once it's processed, a member of our team will be in touch with you to schedule a meet and greet appointment. This is the time when you and all members of your household will come to our shelter to officially make your connection with Morgan.\n\nMorgan\nLabrador Retriever mix\nFemale\nDOB: 1/14/2018\nWeight: 50 lbs. \nHeartworm Negative",

As a result, there is often an adjustment period when learning about life as a family pet. We typically do not adopt dogs to homes with young children. Homes with older children will be considered on an individual basis. Common skills such as house training and leash walking will often take a little extra time. Patience, understanding and a gentle hand are a must. The great news is, most of these dogs come around rather quickly and being a part of their rehabilitation is an extremely rewarding experience.

She does great at the dog park and other neutral areas, such as the groomer . She would benefit from a confident dog in the home to learn that new human friends can be great. She needs to be in a home without children visiting, as they make her particularly nervous and she has been known to nip, especially at their hands. She needs a quiet home without alot of visitors.\n\nIf you are interested, complete the\nAdoption Application\non our website at\nwww.NeedyPaws.org\nand we will contact you.\n\nAdopters must live within an hour's drive of St. Louis, MO.\n\nAmelia's adoption fee is $250.00, which includes up-to-date vaccinations, heartworm testing and preventative, spay/neuter and microchip.\n\nWe are a 100% foster-based rescue and all of our dogs live in approved foster homes. We are dedicated to finding the best Forever Homes, and will perform home visits and conduct veterinarian and reference checks for each potential adopter.",

When the officer picked me up, they noticed I had a patch of hair missing on my rear. I have been seen by a veterinarian and the hairloss was just from fleas. I have received treatment so now we are just waiting for my hair to grow back in! I'm very upbeat and have a lively personality! I love all people and I'll come running to you for snuggles and to give you kisses when you call for me. You'll learn that all I really want is to be right by your side and be your forever companion. I do cool tricks like jumping in the air to catch treats! I will sit on command and the shelter staff thinks I may possibly be housetrained too. If you have other dogs at home, you can bring them with you to meet me. I have met male and female dogs here at the shelter and did great with both of them! I am a 6 year old Pitbull mix and weighs 65 pounds.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this pet, please contact Chesterfield County Animal Services at (804) 748-1683, option \"0\", to schedule an appointment. Office staff are available by phone Monday-Friday 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. and Saturday 7:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. The shelter is located at 9300 Public Works Road, Chesterfield, VA 23832.",

I tend to be shy at first and prefer to go home to a home with women. I need a little time to warm up but once I do you'll see I'm very playful and fun. My ideal adopter would be one who knows a lot about my breed. I get along with some dogs but would prefer to be the only dog in the home. I would do best with children over the age of 16, I cannot live with cats. I'm looking for a fun and active home if you'd like to meet me please fill out an application and a Dog Adoption Counselor will contact you to schedule an appointment.",

She loves to give kisses and play fetch. Roxy is a little shy and would do best in a home with younger children and with a patient, experienced dog owner.\n\n\nPlease call the shelter at 719-543-6464 to set up an appointment to meet her.

I'm  Leia!\nWhere did you meet TAPS?  At a local shelter. My former owners took me to the shelter because I had an injured knee that they couldn't afford to fix my skin allergies. \nHow old are you?  I am around 5-6ish years old\nTell us about yourself!  My knee had surgery and is on the mend and I am on some awesome new special food that seems to have my allergies under control.  I love to run and play and especially really like other dogs to hang out with.  I am silly and affectionate and have a zest for life!\n\nCheck out some videos!

IF YOU ARE FILLING OUT AN APPLICATION ON A PHONE OR PAD, HOLD THEM SIDEWAYS TO SEE ALL OF THE FIELDS.  IF YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO SUBMIT THE APPLICATION AT THE END, IT MEANS YOU HAVE MISSED A FIELD SOMEWHERE AND NEED TO REVIEW THE APPLICATION AGAIN.\n\nWhere can you meet me after you are contacted that you may be a good fit for me?\n\nOPERATION ADOPT TN\nc/o Friendsville Animal Center\n706 Kiser Station Road\nFriendsville, TN  37737\n\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY\n\nAll animals are spayed/neutered, current on age appropriate vaccinations and microchipped before they go to new homes because that's the responsible way to keep them all safe.\n\nTo adopt one of our animals, the first step is filling out an adoption application at www.tapsusa.org Please make sure you get a confirmation that your application has been submitted. \n\nWe only adopt to local homes  in the immediate vicinity because we utilize our volunteer force to process home visits.  Photos of your home, letters of reference are not acceptable which is why we only adopt locally. Only in very rare circumstances do we adopt out of area.  Examples of this would be finding the perfect home for a senior animal or one that has other special needs that we have not been able to place locally for an extended period of time.",

            "description": "Laci is a sweetheart.  She is 5 yrs old and about 38 lbs in size.  She has a typical heeler nature which includes being a good protector and worker.  Heelers like having a job and Laci is loyal to her family to not only love but, guard them against strange things or people.\n\nWe know a bit about her background and she has lived both inside and out.  She is housebroken and lived in different family situations in her past.  We are looking for a home where she can get daily exercise off leash.  Being totally an inside dog tends to make her over protective of her family and she doesn't take well to strangers or strange dogs approaching.  We feel she is ideally suited to a home outside a city where traffic and unfamilar folks are not a common occurrence.  As you can see by her photos she has a kind heart.  We are very fond of her and her sister!\n\nShe is fully vetted, microchipped, been heartworm treated and requires heartguard protection monthly which is not expensive.  Laci has a sister with the same personality and tendencies.  \n\nOther dogs can be an issue with Laci but, she did get along with an existing passive dog in her first adoption with no problems.\n\nWe are a rural shelter with high intakes.  As a result, the shelter dogs are not guaranteed safety. We do our best but, we need help.\nADOPTION FEES APPLY-  Dogs $85-$125.  Cats $60-$80.  (We are not set up for credit or debit payments.)\n\nPlease visit or make an inquiry by calling this number 606-663-4998.  Leave a message on voicemail if you miss the staff.  Your calls are VERY IMPORTANT to us!\nThe shelter is open Monday thru Friday from 9 - 3 p.m. except Thursdays (closed).  Saturday hours are by appt.  \n\nAfter hours appts can be arranged with advance notice and an approved application.  We want to accommodate! \n\nFor an alternate phone, call 859-948-0371.  We are glad to answer any questions.   Adoption rates are low and include a spay or neuter and rabies. Surgeries are mandatory!\n\nShelter is located at 121 Echo Hollow Rd - Clay City, Ky  40312",

            "description": "Molly came into rescue with Lady when their owner moved into an apartment and was told by the landlord that he could not keep them. We believe Lady to be lab/terrier mix. From what we were told by her owner, Molly had a rough start early in life. She was originally owned by someone else who moved out of state and left her tied outside without food or water. Molly was saved by this owner and given a decent life. Molly has had 2 litters of puppies, who all found homes but Molly wants her chance to have a stable, loving home. Molly is approx 3 years old and is really a sweet girl. She gets along well with kids and dogs of all ages and sizes. Cats are unknown and we do not know if she has ever had any experience with cats. She is very gentle and enjoys attention. Molly is crate trained and will go out but we never guarantee any of our dogs to be housebroken. Molly weighed 46.6 pounds at her vet visit on 1/21/21. She is spayed and ready to find a family to spend her days and nights cuddling with. She is a somewhat (initially) shy but happy girl ready to share her affections with a family of her own. Molly, unfortunately, tested positive for heartworms but has started the monthly ivermectin treatment, which is very inexpensive and easy to give. Her new owner will just need to keep her on a monthly ivermectin dose until she receives a negative heartworm test. This can be a slow process but it does work and we have successfully treated many heartworm positive dogs this way through the years.Molly also has some leg deformities and issues on her right side. We did x-rays on back leg as the knee is very unstable and routinely pops in and out. Vet said the surgery to fix can be very costly but she can be managed with a pain management regimen. Vet is unsure if this is something that she was born with or if it is the result of a traumatic injury (such as a hit by car) at some point in her life but eventually, she will probably develop arthritis and difficulties walking, although that is probably many years down the road. She runs, walks and gets around normally right now although she will, occasionally limp. Although we understand that these issues greatly impact her adoptable \"appeal\", we hope that someone can see past physical limitations and will see the beauty of her soul. This girl is so loving and kind and will make an amazing companion!\nMolly''s adoption fee will be $175 and will help to cover her vetting and cost of care while with us. If interested in giving Molly her forever home, please complete and submit our adoption application and interest via email. You may also FB message, text only to (352)215-3260.(phone calls will not be answered or returned from this number but it is the best and quickest option for contact) or call 352-493-1255 (leave message if no answer).",

            "description": "Sheena is a new arrival from Rosebud Reservation who is just sweet as pie! She is approximately 5-6 years old and weighs approximately 40-50 pounds.\n\nSheena is good with other dogs, but not one to play with them - she prefers to watch and hang out instead. Sheena has been exposed to cats and just wants to leave them alone and is cautious when they approach her.\n\nSheena loves everyone she meets - she loves to get ear scratches from all ages. Occasionally she will jump up (super gently) to receive additional attention, but is very good about getting down when reminded.\n\nSheena has been polishing her basic commands and doing well - she is kennel trained and has not had any accidents in the house in her foster so far.\n\nSheena is fully vetted including vaccinations, heartworm tested negative, spayed, microchipped, and current on her flea/tick/heartworm/deworming preventatives. Sheena's adoption donation fee is $250.00\n\nWe realize that people are looking for a predominant breed or breed mixture, but visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of our dogs we are only guessing at the predominant breed or breed mix.  We encourage you to select your new companion by considering each dog's individual personality and pet qualities instead of relying on a breed label that is only a guess.\n\nIf you're interested in adopting, please visit our main website at www.sarahstreasuresrescue.net for adoption information and our application!",

She has been spayed, microchipped, received her rabies, distemper/parvo, bivalent canine influenza and bordetella vaccines, tested negative for heartworms and started on prevention, as well as flea prevention. She has also had a dental cleaning. Bianca requires a home with a secure, physically fenced yard and a companion dog in the home.\n\nBianca came into rescue from a commercial breeder when she was no longer useful to them. She is approximately 8 year old Maltese who is making big strides in rescue. Bianca is learning to walk on a leash but still needs a fenced yard and a companion dog in the home. She does well on housetraining if kept on a schedule but continues to improve. Bianca does well riding in a car but is still learning to do stairs. Bianca requires a patient home that will give her the time to decompress and learn about her new home with the help of a companion dog.PLEASE NOTE: If you are viewing this biography on a website other than the Ohio Fuzzy Pawz website, not all information transfers to partner websites in some instances. If you go to the individual webpage of our dogs, you will be able to get more information each dog.\n\nVisual breed identification in dogs can be unreliable so, in many cases, we are only guessing at the predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n\nOur Adoption Process\n\nThe adoption process has several steps involved.\n\nPlease review prior to submitting an application.\nOur adoption process is detailed here:\n\nhttp://www.ohiofuzzypawz.com/info/adoption\n\nOur volunteers work very diligently to process each application and we try to ensure that we are making the best match possible for each dog. We do not schedule meetings with dogs until an application has been approved. It can take up to a few weeks to process an application or as little time as a few days, from the time you submit an application, please be prepared to adopt as we cannot hold dogs.\n\nSpecial Requirements\n\nSome dogs may have special requirements (for example, medications, a fence) -- if you apply for a dog, please be sure to read over the biography completely to see if there are any special needs and if you're home would be suitable. If we indicate on the dog's biography that a fence is required, this means your home must have a physical fence. Other dogs may require a \"strong vet reference\" which indicates that we are looking for a home that has a documented history of veterinary care with previous pets.\n\nThe first step in our process is to submit an online adoption application at www.ohiofuzzypawz.com/forms. The application MUST include the personal references and veterinary, grooming, and landlord references (if applicable) and their respective contact information. If you do not include the references and the contact information, your application will be delayed as it CANNOT be processed. Once the references have been successfully completed, a home visit is then scheduled when a rescue representative can meet all members of the family or residents of the home.\nNo application is approved prior to the home visit being done.\nAt that point, the Directors will discuss any and all applications on a foster dog and make a selection--in many cases, there are multiple applications for each dog, so please be understanding that our only priority is the successful placement of each of our foster dogs.\n\nOut of State Adoptions\n\nWe do adopt out of state to outstanding applicants, however, our process requires a home visit, so out of state adoptions can take longer.\nWe do not ship our dogs, adopters should be prepared to pick up the dog in Central Ohio.",

So what do we know about Trent: > good with dogs> shares well> great with people and children of all ages> we are working on his house training> crate trained> great in the car> is fearful of leashes (as soon as we put a leash on him he shuts down but we are working on it and it is getting better every day, baby steps)If you would like to learn more about Trent please contact us at bobbiespitrescue@gmail.com.

Griffin arrived to us from the reservation and has adjusted well to the good life.  He's approximately 2 years old and best guess is a mixed Golden/Shepherd/Lab type of pup.  He weighs approximately 65-70 pounds.\n\nGriffin does well with other dogs of all sizes but seems to play better with females.  Griffin has been introduced for cats and he didn't show any aggression towards them, but he will bark at them.\n\nGriffin loves people and tries hard to please.  He's a smart boy who likes to know what you expect and happily obliges when he understands.  Griffin is working on his basic commands and leash manners.  Griffin has been around some children and done but does not currently live with any.  He does occasionally forget his size and needs reminders to 'be gentle'.\n\nGriffin has mastered kennel training and does well at house training - however, he needs to be reminded not to mark territory when first in a new place.  His neuter will help this some, but continued training will continue to improve his understanding that it is not okay inside. \n\nGriffin has a goofy, playful nature about him when he gets comfortable and loves to bounce around and wrestle once comfortable.  He is discovering what toys are and is starting to incorporate these as he plays!\n\nGriffin has started on his vet work and will be completing it shortly.  Upon going into his new approved forever home, Griffin will be up to date on vaccinations, heartworm tested negative, microchipped, neutered, and current on his flea/tick/heartworm/deworming protocols.  Griffin's Adoption Donation Fee is $300.00\n",

PLEASE LEAVE US A VOICEMAIL IF YOU ARE UNABLE TO REACH US. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE AND UNDERSTANDING.- CCDP STAFF**\n\nHi there. My name is Brutus. I'm about 10 years old and I weigh a little over 40 lbs. \nI was surrendered to the pound through no fault of my own and I am now looking for a new loving family to join. \nI am very sweet. I love people and I get along well with other dogs, but would do best in a home without cats. \nIn am said to be housebroken and I do well with keeping my kennel clean at night. \nIf you're looking for a sweet dog to add to your family, please consider adopting me.\n\nOur adoption fee is $150.00. The pound DOES NOT accept checks for adoption fees. We're able to accept cash for adoption OR Visa/ Mastercard/ Discover Card. A convenience fee of 2.39% will be applied to all credit/ debit card adoptions. If you intend to do a foster-to-adopt, the fee must be cash. ALL dogs/puppies adopted from our shelter will receive their parvo distemper vaccine, bordetella vaccine, rabies vaccine (if aged at 12 weeks or older), be dewormed with a 3 day course of panacur dewormer, be microchipped, receive their current Ohio dog license and will be spayed or neutered. ALL DOGS/PUPPIES WILL BE SPAYED OR NEUTERED unless a health issue prohibits the surgery from being performed. Not all dogs posted for adoption are spayed/ neutered yet. If you're driving a long distance to adopt, please verify that the vetting process has been completed and dog you're interested in adopting is still available for adoption. The above mentioned vetting is all included in your adoption fee. The adoption fee and what is included in the adoption fee is NON-NEGOTIABLE.\n\nAdoptions MUST be done at the pound and in person as there is paperwork to fill out and an adoption contract that must be signed by the adopter. This means you must be willing to travel to our shelter to adopt.\n\nIF the dog you're interested in adopting has medical conditions or injuries which require medical treatment, we ask that you help with the medical bills so we can continue to help the dogs coming in who need additional vet care.\nWe are a county run shelter, therefore we cannot control our intake or the health or behavior of the dogs that come in to our shelter.\n\nAlthough we try our hardest to place all of our adoptable dogs, there are certain circumstances in which any dog in our care could be euthanized at any time and without further notice (IE: sudden untreatable medical condition or injury, temperament or behavioral problems which may not be apparent when the dog first arrives, lack or space, etc.), therefore all dogs at our shelter should be considered urgent. The adoption of a more highly adoptable dog will mean more time for the less adoptable dog in the kennel next to him!\n\nShelter hours are: Monday-Friday: 8 am- 4 pm\nSaturday: 8 am - 11 am.\nSunday: 8 am - 11 am.\nAdoptions are always welcome during hours of operation. We will make special arrangements for adoptions in advance.\nThere is nobody in the office on Saturday and Sunday, so therefore we are unable to answer or return phone calls over the weekend.\n\nCan't adopt a dog? We would love to have more volunteers who are able to spend time with our dogs! The dogs LOVE going for walks and the socialization and exercise helps make the dogs more adoptable.\n\nContact information:\n8455 County Home Road\nLisbon, OH 44432\n(330)424-6663\nEmail: hpecorelli@ccclerk.org",

He was very timid when he first arrived, but has come out of his shell a lot as he has gotten more comfortable. Skippy has been comfortable being handled and he seems to be a very playful boy. We named him Skippy because he loves to \u201cskip\u201d around when he meets new dogs. When approached by other dogs, Skippy exchanged sniffs with his tail wagging and then he was ready to play. Other dogs took Skippy\u2019s playful energy well and they wanted to play with him too. When walking through our cat room, Skippy sniffed around but was much more interested in the humans in the room than the cats.",

She is super sweet and loves everyone.\n\nHi I'm Pinky, and I'm pretty perfect! Check out my resume: \n \nBorn: in Alabama and I think the snow is GREAT. \n\nSkills: go potty outside, hangout by myself inside and outside of my crate, know exactly what dog beds are for, chew and nap while my foster parents work, make friends easily (even the cats), share my food and toys, take baths, snore, give hugs and kisses, smile a lot, spread peace and joy. \n\nI'm gentle and calm, but also curious about the big world out there! I'm a happy girl who loves to play, but I also love relaxing and being comfy. I'm looking for a home that can make me as happy as I know I can make them. I can't wait to meet you!\n\nInterested in this sweet dog? Apply today at http://www.underdogpetrescue.org/dog-application\n\n**Please note: Our animals live in foster homes throughout the Madison area. We do not have a shelter where animals are available for daily viewing. Applying is the first step in our process.**\n\nDogs from Underdog Pet Rescue come with the following medical care already provided:\nSpay/Neuter\nRabies, Distemper, and Bordetella Vaccinations (as age appropriate-puppy adopters may need to cover some vaccine boosters)\nHeartworm Test (for dogs over 6mo)\nMicrochip\nDeworming\nHeartworm and Flea/Tick Preventative\nAny other necessary medical treatment as recommended by veterinarian\n\nOur adult dog adoption fee is $300. Our puppy (under 5 mo) is $375. Our senior dog (over 8 yrs) is $250.\n\n*Please note that all breeds noted are estimates or best guesses. We very rarely have information on our animals' actual breeds since they often come to the shelters we work with as strays*",

            "description": "Hello, my name is Lexus!\n\nThe GHS thinks I am awesome because I LOVE people and completely win over every person I meet. I like to lean into people as they pet me and sometimes even end up in their lap-the closer the better! My foster mom says I am the quietest husky ever and make an excellent work from home buddy, I just cuddle up at your feet while you work. You would never know I am 9 years old as I love to run around and play and I look so cute when I get the zoomies! I am also incredibly smart and very treat motivated!\n\nMy new family should know that although I love affection I can get a little nervous when being handled in more formal settings, such as for the vet or for nail trims. My foster mom has been working hard to help me get more comfortable with my paws being handled and I have come a long way already-she can now trim my nails while I am lying down! I am looking for a family who will use positive training methods to continue to work with me on being more comfortable with certain handling. Don't worry, I am very eager to work for my treats!\nI have been diagnosed with diabetes, but am well managed on my daily insulin and special diet. For my insulin, as long as there is lots of peanut butter and cheese whiz involved, with two people it has not been a problem for my fosters! I am looking for a family that has knowledge or experience with diabetic dogs and is willing to continue this medical care.\n\nI have met several children in foster and really like the attention they give me. I could live in a home with respectful children who know not to hug me or touch my paws until I am more comfortable. I can be a little unsure around other dogs but once I am more comfortable I like to play. I could do well as the only dog in the home or live with another calm, respectful dog. I have lived with cats before and done well.\n\nI do not have the best hearing but my foster mom has started teaching me hand signal commands and I already know sit, down, paw, stay, and come in hand signals-that's how smart I am! I am such an affectionate, smart, playful girl and everyone who has met me loves me. If you are looking for a loyal best friend, I am definitely your girl!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting me, please visit the Guelph Humane Society's \"How to Adopt\" page (https://guelphhumane.ca/adopt/how-to-adopt/) and submit an Expression of Interest (EOI) form as soon as possible so you don't miss out on taking me home!",

            "description": "Oswald is a lovely boy but he can be a bit shy at first. Once he warms up he is a total darling, he enjoys playing with his toys and playing in the yard. He gets nervous when meeting new people, so he will need your help to gain confidence and would love a low key home with adults. \n\nHe likes other dogs but is still learning that not every dog wants to play with the same enthusiasm as him. He is looking for a patient family who can provide him with daily exercise, enrichment, and help him navigate the world. \n\nOswald is a foster-to-adopt candidate due to a healing injury. Please ask the adoption councilor for more details on what this entails. \n\nHe is currently awaiting adoption in a foster home. If you are interested in Oswald, please call 1-866-648-6263 to schedule a time to come in and meet this adorable dog!",

He is estimated to be about 6 years and would love to be your snuggle buddy! Koi's adoption fee includes his neuter, age appropriate vaccines, a microchip, heartworm test and treatment, and an initial deworming.

He's improving, but not quite there yet. \n\nDeke enjoys playing with his foster's other dogs and does okay with the cats. When he's not playing, he enjoys a good cuddle. He is good with people of all ages. \nHe would do best in a home with a fenced in back yard.\n\nDeke's adoption fee is $136.00.  If you are interested in making this handsome boy a part of your family, please complete an adoption application and email it to us at myhappytail@yahoo.com.

I am a very good boy but I would be happiest if I could be the puppy king of the castle in my new home. I do not like to play with other dogs and I am much more interested in receiving human affection. Cats and children are also not my favorite so if you're an experienced single dog owner or couple, I'd love to meet you! I would be happiest if I could have a home with a big yard for me to run around in and an owner who loves to play with toys or have a rousing game of fetch. I'm also a huge cuddle bug and would love nothing more than snuggling up next to you on the couch. I could use some continued training once I find my furever home but I appear to be potty trained at this point, as I keep my kennel very clean. I would love to have an active owner who wants to take me for lots of walks and maybe even a swim! If you're looking for an activity buddy, I am just the perfect pick!",

I am a Pittie mix, about 3 years old and weigh in at a solid 65lbs. My foster dad says I am a handsome boy with my silver coloring! I am looking for my FOREVER FAMILY!  You see, I was dumped off by my family one night.  My foster dad heard a loud truck pull up outside his house at like 4am and, in the morning, there I was waiting by the front gate.  I even had a collar on with my name on it.  Not sure why my old family didn't want me anymore - I tried to be the best boy.  Whatever the reason, I have come to understand that it really was a day that changed my life for the better because my foster family is amazing. They tell me I am a good boy and have gotten me all ready to find a home of my very own!\n \nWhat else would you like to know about me?  My foster dad says I am a sweet boy who loves attention. I am a medium to high energy and will need my new family to be active.  We can walk and hike and play together! My rescue is looking for people that have experience with my breed.  I haven't had much training so I\u2019m looking forward to my new family helping me be all I can be!  We think a teen/adult home would be best for me, just because I am a big boy and don't want to accidentally knock any kids over....I would feel terrible!  I am fostered with other dogs and do fine with most of them.  I can be  a little choosy about my canine buddies so I might be best as an only pet- king of the castle so to speak. My foster dad says no cats- they just want to make me chase them!  I am crate trained and learning to walk on leash (I do pull sometimes) and coming along with my house training.  It's all new to me, but with a good, consistent routine and positive reinforcement, I know I will learn quickly!  I am a work in progress!!\n \nYou'll be happy to hear that I have been neutered and am up to date on my vaccines, I am also micro-chipped and flea-tick and heartworm preventative. If you are a pittie lover who has experience with my breed and are looking for a new BFF, please email  ...Nancy at campellones58@gmail.com................. and she'll zip you out an application.  I\u2019m not perfect yet, but I\u2019ll work hard to be perfect for you.  My adoption fee is $350.\n \nLike us on facebook: https://www.facebook.com/PawsClawsNewEngland\nFollow/tag us on Instagram: @pawsclawsne or #pawsclawsne",

He thinks he's a small dog and likes to sit on the furniture with you and loves to sleep in the bed. He gets along with most other dogs but does like to be more of a leader. He does not do well with cats. Rex is very smart, he knows sit and down and stay (a little). He is housetrained. He walks on a leash well but has lots of energy. Rex is looking for a home preferable with a fenced yard (higher fence, 6 ft), or someone that is active and can handle his energy level. He also needs a home with an experienced dog owner, hopefully one with large dog experience. He can be stubborn at times and needs someone who can be a firm pack leader. He would certainly benefit and enjoy additional obedience training. Due to his size and energy level, Rex is best suited for a home with older or no children. Rex is neutered, current on all vet work and microchipped.\n\nLOCAL INQUIRIES ONLY PLEASE",

You can follow her on instagram: @katie_phbt\n\nKatie will be spayed, microchipped, and getting final vaccinations on 2/19.\n\nBecause Katie is a puppy, we have certain NO EXCEPTION rules for her adoption:\nadopters must live within 1 hour of Philadelphia if she is adopted before her 2/19 vet appointment (continued puppy vet care at our partner clinics)\nadopters must have another young, playful, dog friendly dog in their home (this promotes continued socialization....and also we think Katie would just THRIVE with another dog to play with). \nAgain, WE WILL NOT MAKE EXCEPTIONS. So sorry to be so blunt but we receive so many apps for pups that do not qualify and it makes it very hard on our volunteers that process these applications.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application on our website: www.phillybullyteam.com",

            "description": "Walter is a 2 year old active bulldog who loves to run, play, and is working on his mouthy manners.  He knows sit but jumping up on people is a work in progress.  Who can blame him for being so excited to see humans? He was left in the home after his owners were evicted.  Then he went to the shelter and was scared.  He is working on being consistent on potty training - he is too scared you will leave him outside to spend the time going potty.  His foster family says that he has made huge leaps in the week he has been with us and will continue to make progress.  Walter will not be available for homes with kids under 10 due to his mouthiness and tendency to crash into humans. Are you looking for an active boy who likes other dogs and could use some help with manners? Apply for Walter today!\n\nOur adoption application can be found on our website www.peachesbullyrescue.com/adopting along with the adoption process information and the fee range.",

            "description": "Get ready to fall in love! Pinky is about 60 pounds of happiness and joy. He enjoys being with people or other well behaved dogs. He would probably do best in a home with a doggie play buddy to wear off some of his energy or in an active household. While he has good stamina and lots of energy, he also loves spending time on the couch with someone. (We melted the first time he put his big head on our shoulder!)\nPinky will pull at your heart strings with his affectionate ways. He wants to be included in everything you do, but can be distracted with a good Nylabone or a filled peanut butter bone.\nThis guy would be best in a family of adults and maybe older teens. Younger children would be ok too after Pinky goes to basic training to contain his excitement around smaller children.\nPinky enjoys a comfy bed and delicious food. He does well sleeping in a crate at night, but sometimes needs a potty break. When he does bark, it's usually because he needs to go to the restroom or wants a drink of water.\nSqueaky toys get him excited but he needs the super chewer kind or he ends up deconstructing them. He likes playing frisbee but doesn't always release it on demand.\nRunning through puddles is another of his favorite pastimes and rain usually doesn't bother him. He likes every dog he's ever met: big, small, male and female. He is curious about cats, but we don't recommend a house with cats. If he's with another dog, Pinky likes to run and play chase. If he's alone he prefers being inside to spending time in the back yard (and who wouldn't with his light colored coat?).\nPinky would enjoy going to a training class, since he's a very smart boy and wants to please. He does walk well on a leash or harness (no pulling unless he sees a squirrel).\nPinky loves you already and hasn't even met you yet!\nIf you are interested in Pinky and would like to fill out a Dog Adoption Application, please go to: http://www.homelesspets.net/adoption-forms/dog-adoption.php . Submitting an application does not obligate you to adopt from us but it initiates contact with us and gets the process started. If you have questions prior to filling out the application, email us at HOPEDogCommittee@groups.io and a volunteer will get back to you.",

            "description": "Hannah is a stunning girl around 7-yrs-old.  She has absolutely had a hard life - she was found wandering the streets starving - we have no idea how long she was on our own before being taken to a kill shelter from which we rescued.  We feel like she was probably abandoned and left to fend for herself on the streets. \n She is such a sweet, loving girl and the perfect combination - she is very chill and relaxed but still has tons of energy and bounces around like she's much younger!   She is great with people, kids, dogs. She is heartworm positive.  At this point, we are doing slow kill which is a specific heartworm preventative pill that's around $10 per month.  We just want the most amazing loving home for this girl - she deserves the best.  Adoption fee 300.  Email me directly for application kellih@comporium.net",

            "description": "Please read about King before applying.   King is a very friendly, handsome big bouncy boy.  He is a little over a year old and has developed into a strong overly energetic puppy that had no training growing up.  King is smart and loves to please and will sit, stay and give paw for a treat.  If you see him as a dog that you would love to have (and who wouldn\u2019t), please know that you must be willing to commit to continue with his training to help him become a great dog and companion as he still has a long way to go.   He needs lots of exercise, not just put outside to run around on his own, but long walks or someone that is willing to play ball with him for long periods of time. A tired dog is a good dog. \n\nWithout  time invested in him, King will be destructive left on  his own.  He is learning to walk on a leash but is still a strong puller.   King is a diamond in the rough, but he needs a strong, experienced leader, he is definitely not for the first time dog owner or for someone that cannot handle his strength.  The continuation of his training is a must so make sure that you have the time, patience and can make the commitment to do this before you apply.  \n\nKing is neutered, vaccinated (including bordetella) and microchipped. His adoption fee is $215.00. (cash or check only, we are unable to accept credit cards)\n\nKing is kindly sponsored by: Barb Smith in memory of Gary Smith, Dan Courtine  in honor of Amy Peterson, David and Patricia Nye, Tina and James McCroskey, Melford Swanson, Suzanne and former NCCR residents, Tillie Mae and Bron Bron, Dave and Nancy Nuzzo, Joseph Incavo, Cathy and David Ferguson, and Mo and Andrew Broadbent in memory of Kofi. Thank you everyone!\n\nIf you think you might be interested in adopting, your first step should be to complete an adoption application. APPLICATION to ADOPT: Copy and paste this link in your browser to view and complete the application https://forms.gle/NghtT4WTNiaZu7Cg9. You can also select the link, right click and choose open in a new window.\n\nWe do adopt out of state, however we do not transport or ship dogs.  Potential adopter must be able and willing to travel to the Rescue to meet the dog they are interested in.  \n\n*PLEASE double check all of the phone numbers that you provide as if they are incorrect, we will be unable to process your application.  Please also let your references know that someone from NCCR will be calling them. Most adoption team members call from their personal phone so advise your references that there may be an unknown number or a private number calling them.  \n\nNYS Registration #RR028.",

            "description": "Good morning from Coco.  She came into rescue through no fault of her own.  She lived with an 86 and 94 year old pair of sisters that were no longer able to take care of her.\nShe is a good girl but will need manners training.  She is 4 years old and up to date on vaccines.  She will be checked to confirm if she\u2019s spayed, she will be microchipped and heartworm tested.  I have worked on crating, because I work all day and would prefer to see her in a home with more freedom.  I also think children around 8 or so would be better.  With her size, kids that age and above are a bit more stable on their feet.  She is house trained also.  Cats are a definite NO!   She enjoys being outside and plays well with my personal dog.  If you are interested in Coco for a companion for your dog she will need to have a meet and greet along with a home visit since she has been dog selective.  A fenced in yard is a must also.  She likes to run around and sniff everything.  Coco is a big girl and very strong.  She\u2019s pretty good on a leash and can be a bit stubborn.  \n",

            "description": "Finn is a very handsome, big, young Pyr boy looking for his furever home. Finn has been very well-loved and is currently living with his brother. Like many littermates they are not getting along as they get older. Finn has done well with his minimal exposure to other dogs and as always proper introductions will set him up for success. He is house trained and knows sit, stay and off. He\u2019s looking forward to learning more and, like all youngsters, will need continued training to help him reach his full potential! Finn is still curious, and the occasional shoe or napkin will fall victim to puppy chewing :) Finn likes leisurely walks and is working on his leash skills. He enjoys playing fetch and then lounging around for the rest of the day. Finn does well meeting new people and is gentle with kids. His favorite thing ever is to lay on your legs while getting brushed. Like a good Pyr, Finn will alert you of incoming danger - squirrels, mailmen, you-name-it! He\u2019s a true protector of his home and he\u2019s proud of that. Finn is pretty calm for his age and wants to be with his humans wherever they go. He is sure to quickly find his way into your heart the minute he sits at your feet and gently puts his nose to yours to remind you to pay attention to him. When falling asleep, he will let out a sweet and hilarious sigh after a long day protecting his pack :) Finn is a big, wonderful boy with even bigger potential, so if you\u2019re a committed family, looking for a young Pyr to add to your pack, apply for handsome Finn today!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nView full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed. \n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

She is a 1-year old, 55-pound American Staffordshire Terrier female located in Norton, MA. She\u2019s hoping to be adopted before her 2nd birthday which is on April 14th! Shelby is a pretty red head who\u2019s up to date on all her shots including heartworm and flea & tick prevention. She is spayed, house trained, and crate trained. She does perfect in her crate overnight and when left alone. \n\nShelby enjoys chew bones and sets the record for quickly ripping out the stuffing from her soft toys! She loves her walks and her favorite season is summer when she can run around outdoors and hike. Shelby also loves car rides (#ShelbyGT500) but does get car sick, so travelling on an empty stomach is best for her. \n\nShe spends her days sleeping especially in winter, but between naps she loves playing in the snow. Watch out around 4 pm however because that\u2019s when she peps up and gets her zoomies! And she\u2019s smart, too! Shelby understands most basic commands such as sit, stay, leave-it, wait, down, and \u201cin your crate.\u201d She wants you to know that she\u2019s not a fan of rain.\n\nShelby gets along well with other dogs and likes playing with them. She lives with a chi right now, but prefers dogs her size or larger as she tends to be a little rough with smaller dogs and does not understand the size difference. If she does go to a home with other dogs she should eat her meals and treats alone. \n\nShelby is being rehomed because she is too anxious around small children. Her current family has an active 5-year old who just wants to play, but Shelby prefers her personal space and quiet time. She is great with adults, but the little ones are overwhelming! Therefore, Shelby would do best in a family without small children, respectful kids 12 and up are a better match. \n \nThough nervous at times, Shelby now has a calmer outlook on life since taking prescription medication. This should be continued at least for a few months until she is adjusted to a new home, though there\u2019s no guarantee how long meds will be needed. ARK trainer and friend Maura Porter of Clear Skies Training has worked with Shelby and agrees she\u2019s a good all-around dog but one that\u2019s not suited for young kids.\n \nShelby has one nipping incident in her otherwise loving nature. Last year, Shelby had a growth removed, which required her to wear the cone of shame for two months. When her current mom leaned into the cone for a kiss, Shelby became startled and nipped. Lesson learned, no kissing a dog in a cone!  Otherwise she has been nothing sweet.\n\nRe-cap: Love bug who appreciates \u201cme time.\u201d Best for kids 12+, no cats, compatible dog.

Our rescue friends in Louisiana took them in and got them to the vet and into a loving foster home. We are working on their spay-neuter, vaccines, and microchip. We hope Krissy and Jude can come to New Jersey January 23 or February 6th. Krissy is dog friendly! She has not been officially \"kid\" tested yet but her Louisiana foster mom thinks she will do well with kids since she is just a big puppy looking for love! Krissy's adoption fee is $400.\n\nHow to Adopt Me!\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about me, and possibly making me part of your family, please go to wagoninn.rescuegroups.org.

            "description": "This sweet guy is Granger, 1-2 years old and 67lbs, and he is deaf. He is underweight and had been feeding on rocks and dirt. Poor Granger is scared of being touched due to feeling like he is going to be hit. When he sees you mean no harm, he loves pets and to be loved on. He is still wary but learning he is in good hands now. Upon gaining weight, he will be a big guy. He is pit bull terrier mixed with bulldog or great dane. The person who found him said his own dogs tried to attack Granger but all he did was walk away with no aggression shown. He would do best in a home with another dog to give him confidence and show him the ropes.\n\nApply to adopt Granger at EHRDOGS.ORG",

Thank you! \n****************\nChanci is an approximately 2-3 year old Boxer mix  that is currently available for adoption at the Des Moines County Humane Society in Burlington, Iowa.  A meet and greet would be required with any other dogs that would be in a potential adopter's home.  Chanci needs a home without cats.  Additionally, she loves, loves, LOVES her toys so much that young kids are probably not a good idea for her.  Chanci knows how to sit and takes treats pretty softly.  She is a sweet and loving dog.  Poor Chanci has had it rough this past month and is in desperate need of a family that can turn her life around.... Read below for Chanci's story... \n\nSome background on Chanci:  \n\nA very kind couple were on a trail hike in Lake Geode when they came across this sweet girl trying to stay warm in a snow-covered hole.  Her pawprints have frostbite and she was absolutely freezing and probably would not have made it much longer out there.  As you can see in the pictures, the young man managed to somehow get her in a backpack and he CARRIED her out 2 miles out of the trails on his back.  She is very thin and appears to have previously had a couple litters of pups.  Another person reports having seen the dog 3 days ago as she was driving through Geode.  She stopped and turned around but sadly, could not find her.  We believe our sweet girl has been out there for at least a week.  A big thank you to the angels who brought her to us.  And remember, we have no idea if she is a lost dog or was dumped.  This poor girl was so defeated and sad when found but is now gaining her security back with the help of our staff.  She is now a happy, much more outgoing girl.\n\n******\nAll dog adoptions include the spay/neuter, heartworm test, first two sets of basic immunizations as well as a rabies vaccine and a vet visit. Our adoption fee is $125.00 and all dogs do require an approved application. \n\nPlease note our adoption hours: Tues-Fri from 3-6pm and from 1-5 on the weekends. We are closed on Mondays!",

We don't know how he is around small children but since he is a little skittish, we will only send him home with older children.  We don't know how he is around cats.  Once he was vetted, it was discovered that he was heartworm positive.  He has started treatment and we are looking for a calm household (no other dogs), where he can be fostered to continue out his treatment.  Families would need to be available to bring him to our vet in Pacific for this.  Luke requires at least a 4 foot fence.\n\nLuke is 2 years old.  His current weight is around 85 pounds.\n\nThe minimum donation for Luke is $450.00. This includes all of his vetting. If you are interested in Luke, please fill out an online application through our website.\n\nWe are currently only open by appointment only. Due to the recent pandemic, we are looking at the safety of our volunteers that are there to take care of the dogs. Only serious inquiries will be considered.\n\nThen meet him at the shelter during adoption hours on Saturdays and Sundays 10 - 2pm. All members of the household need to meet the dog you are interested in. Vet records for any current or previous pets need to be provided. If all goes well, a home visit will be done prior to adoption.",

            "description": "Age: Estimate 7 - 10 years\nWeight: 54 lbs (as of 01/04/21)\n\nLocation: RI\n\nThis dog has been spayed/neutered, is up to date on shots, on heartworm preventative and is microchipped.\n\nDiGi is a sweet and gentle girl!\n\nThis beautiful lady is going to be the perfect addition to someone's home! We are thinking sweet DiGi is a Shepherd mix but we aren't sure of her age, and are guessing about 7-10 years old. She is a new mom that recently weaned eight healthy and happy pups.\n\nShe is affectionate with everyone she meets including kids of all ages. Her foster mom says DiGi is always gentle and affectionate with her three-year-old grandson. DiGi is just coming off exercise restriction, as she was on heartworm treatment, and while there are other dogs at her foster home, she hasn't interacted with them on a daily basis. We thus don't know how she is with other dogs but suspect she will be ok as she is so even-tempered and gentle. She also lives with cats, but hasn't spent too much time with them but is unengaged when she sees them.\n\nDiGi is a smart girl that is house trained and crate trained. Looking for a walking partner? If so, DiGi is the dog for you! She rides well in the car and would love to join you on a walk or hike. A fenced yard would be ideal so DiGi could run and play safely, but if that's not available she'll need lots of leash walks and opportunities for off-leash play in a fenced area. An obedience course would be great for DiGi; it will help teach her good manners and commands, further socialization with other dogs and people, and will help build that very important bond between a dog and her human.\n\nDiGi is a gentle happy girl who just wants a loving forever home. Can you make her dream come true? Fill out an application today and let her know that you'd love to have her join your family!\n\nDiGi's story: We don't know much about this sweet girl other than she was found as a pregnant stray. She is doing great and can't wait to meet you!\n\nMedical Note: This dog has been treated for heartworm disease with melarsomine injections. Once treatment is completed and the dog tests negative for microfilaria, the dog will be cleared to resume normal activity and able to be adopted. Untreated heartworm disease can cause lasting damage to the heart, lungs and arteries, and can affect the dog's health and quality of life even after the parasites are gone, possibly presenting as medical complications and/or new conditions in the future. This dog showed no symptoms of heartworm disease before or during treatment. A good resource for more information on heartworm disease is: https://www.heartwormsociety.org/pet-owner-resources/heartworm-basics.\n\nMedical Note: This dog tested positive for exposure to ehrlichia while in SOS foster care. This does not mean that this dog had ehrlichia. This dog is/has been asymptomatic while in SOS care and was preventatively treated with a 28-day course of doxycycline. Please see here for more information on ehrlichia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehrlichiosis_(canine).\n\nMedical Note: This dog's teeth are badly worn; both maxillary and mandibular incisors and canines are worn to the gum line. This is likely from living with no flea/tick control and chewing on her fur to bring herself relief. Her back molars are still functional but show some wear. While she has been in our care, she has been eating and drinking fine, and has not shown any signs of discomfort. This should be monitored and extractions may be recommended in the future if discomfort is noticed. Additionally, mature cataracts were observed in both eyes, but the dog is not blind and is observed to navigate new environments and get around without issue.\n\nPlease check with your vet if you should have any questions or concerns about these conditions, and discuss any concerns you may have with your SOS Adoption Counselor.\n\nAdoption Fee: $585\n\nTo apply for this dog, fill out an adoption application on our website: www.sosarl.org/aa/\n\n**Additional info you should know - For most of our dogs, we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each of our dogs as an individual and do our best to describe and place them based on personality not breed label. Some dogs may not yet be in New England, nor ready for immediate adoption. There may be additional vetting, quarantine, waiting periods and/or fees depending upon your state of residence. If you have questions or concerns on any of this, you can discuss this with your Adoption Counselor.",

A 78 pound Weimaraner known as the \"Gray Ghost\" because of this breeds friendliness, obedience and beauty. Gibbs is a senior dog about 11 years old but he presents a picture of streamlined grace, sleekness and balance. He was surrendered because the person was unable to care for him any longer. Given his age he does have some hip problems and is on Cosequin DS for the rest of his life. Gibbs has a loving nature and loves quality time with his people and he enjoys the company of cats! He walks well on a leash..but because of his age long walks are not his preference. A nice day basking in the sun is more his style. We are looking for someone that is home more often then not has a home and a yard and is able to spend time with himhe loves his person and does not leave your side. Gibbs is a beautiful doglooking for his Furever Home with someone who wants a gentle loving companion to hang out withand live out his retirement years. If your that someone...fill out an applicationGibbs is waiting!!!",

            "description": "Meet MAX.... He is a 5 year old Jack Russel/Wired hair terrier mix boy, 18 lbs, who was surrendered to us because the new wife of the previous owner didn't want dogs in the house and so they got kicked out in a dirt pen in the yard. Max got surrendered with his female companion Maggie. They are very bonded but due to the fact that they are very scared of everything new they are depending so much on each other that in their case it can be a hold back for them to get out of their comfort zone and explore new things.\nMeans it would be not a terrible thing to break them up and adopt them out separate but they are also available as a pair.\n\nMaggie is the more outgoing one of the two while Max is her follower.\n\nMaggie is a Jack Russel Terrier, also 5 years old, 16 lbs.\nMax is currently going through his heartworm treatment, which is fully taken care of by our organization. No side effects are expected and it will not hinder him from a happy and active life.\n\nBoth of them have no leash experience and we are looking for a home with a fenced in yard. The reason why is they won't go outside to potty if their only chance to go outside is on a leash which is frightening to them. So one step at the time and there can not be an exception made.\n\nThey are crate trained and have no potty accidents in a crate. Both love to snuggle and are very sweet and gentle dogs.\nWe don't know how they are with cats, potentially great but they are very intimidated by other dogs but will adjust and come around. \nWe are looking for a home with no small children. They do very well with small children but younger active and loud children might make them nervous and intimidated. Older Children 10+ will be best.\n\nThose two are amazing they are just very sad and heartbroken and in need of a real and loving home.\n\nIf you would like to meet Max and his friend Maggie or just one of them, please send us a message in order to receive an application. We are only able to meet with approved applicants by appointment.\n\nOur adoption fee is $ 350 which includes all vaccines, heartworm test ( treatment), spay and neuter and micro chip. We of course offer a discounted adoption fee if they get adopted as a pair.",

She is a bit grouchy and can be snippy when she first meets you but just needs a chance to get to know you a bit.  Once she does, she loves sitting in your lap and being petted and cuddled.  She also really loves her pink toy and treats!  She was brought to PAWS with two other dogs because mom had to move and couldn't take them with her.  Daisy was very afraid and confused but soon began to see that this was a pretty cool place to be while waiting for her new forever home.  She is about 10 lbs and is black, grey and white.  She is believed to have been born around 12/17/2010.  She is spayed, microchipped, dewormed, current on her rabies and parvo/distemper shots, Heartworm negative and on preventative.  If you have a nice quiet home with no children and not a lot of traffic in and out, Daisy is the perfect girl for you.  Just know that she doesn't always present well or make a good first impression but if you have patience and love, she is a wonderful little girl who will make your life complete!  Her adoption fee is $200.00.",

Her finder tells us she was gentle, crate-trained and played with the other dogs in the house. We're also told that Suki is a sweetheart-snuggler who loves riding in the car, playing ball and knows sit and shake. Since arriving at PACC, Suki has been a little bit nervous, but staffers say she's a very sweet girl. In play group, Suki was shy at first, but quickly initiated play with other pups. Staffers say she's a very social and tolerant player. She's easy to leash up, walks well and enjoys treats. In play group, she got along well with other dogs, but she's not a fan of the littles. For that reason, we recommend a home free from small dogs. We're sure Suki would love to get out of the shelter and into a home. If she seems like the girl for you, make an appointment and meet her today.",

            "description": "Meet Miss Maggie.... She is a 5 year old Jack Russel female, 16 lbs who was surrendered to us because the new wife of the previous owner didn't want dogs in the house and so they got kicked out in a dirt pen in the yard. Maggie got surrendered with her male companion Max. They are very bonded but due to the fact that they are very scared of everything new they are depending so much on each other that in their case it can be a hold back for them to get out of their comfort zone and explore new things.\nMeans it would be not a terrible thing to break them up and adopt them out separate but they are also available as a pair.\n\nMaggie is the more outgoing one of the two while Max is her follower.\n\nMax is a terrier mix, also 5 years old, 18 lbs and is currently going through his heartworm treatment.\n\nBoth of them have no leash experience and we are looking for a home with a fenced in yard. The reason why is they won't go outside to potty if their only chance to go outside is on a leash which is frightening to them. So one step at the time and there can not be an exception made.\n\nThey are crate trained and have no potty accidents in a crate. Both love to snuggle and are very sweet and gentle dogs.\nWe don't know how they are with cats, potentially great but they are very intimidated by other dogs but will adjust and come around. \nWe are looking for a home with no small children. They do very well with small children but younger active and loud children might make them nervous and intimidated. Older Children 10+ will be best.\n\nThose two are amazing they are just very sad and heartbroken and in need of a real and loving home.\n\nIf you would like to meet Maggie and her buddy Max or just one of them, please send us a message in order to receive an application. We are only able to meet with approved applicants by appointment.\n\nOur adoption fee is $ 350 which includes all vaccines, heartworm test ( treatment), spay and neuter and micro chip. We of course offer a discounted adoption fee if they get adopted as a pair.",

            "description": "Moxie(formerly Pandora) is an approximately five year old female chihuahua/pomeranian mix and weighs about 10 pounds. She is extremely sweet and likes to be with you whenever possible. Moxie sleeps quietly in her kennel at night and is potty trained as long as she is let out regularly. Moxie likes other dogs and people but takes a minute to warm up as she is shy. She does tend to bond faster and stronger with women than men.\n\nShe walks very nicely on a leash and is fairly quiet unless someone comes to the door. Consistency and general soft training and exposure are things that will really help this girl come out of her shell. Professional training is recommended, and some is included in her adoption fee. No small children due to her size and fearfulness. Moxie is currently located in the Kansas City area and it would be great if the adopter could be located in the area so multiples meetings could be set up with Moxie prior to going home with her new family. Moxie first came to us pregnant and was returned due to not bonding with her male adopter(no harsh words, this was a hard decision and was best for Moxie). She will take patience in her new home. Moxie is UTD on vacc., microchipped, and spayed. To apply to adopt visit www.handsofhoperescue.com/adoptapp.\nMoxie\n's adoption fee is $250. All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. This dog is fostered in Kansas City, KS and adopter must drive to pick up. We do not ship or deliver. We do allow out of state adoptions, however qualified in state applications will be given preference. Please Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. To learn about Hands of Hope Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at HandsofHopeRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

Joey is that kind of boy, and we are so happy that he got to go to a foster home to hang out until he can find a forever family. Joey is ready to chase whatever he can, including cats, so we don't recommend a family with cats in the house, as he might just find them way too interesting! We look forward to getting to know him better.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This pet has been posted by Friends of Campbell County Animal Control, Rustburg, VA. For questions about the pet, please email us at FOACinfo@gmail.com. All adoptions begin with an application, found under the \"Animals\" tab on our website, friendsofcampbellcounty.org. *Unaltered babies under the age of six months can be adopted only to residents of Campbell County, the City of Lynchburg, and counties touching Campbell County. *Unaltered adult pets six months or older will need to be sterilized before they can be adopted outside our local area of Campbell County, the City of Lynchburg, or counties touching Campbell. *We do not promote dog adoptions to homes where an invisible fence is the fencing of choice. *We do not permit cats or kittens to be declawed following adoption.",

He\u2019s very lucky to be alive as he was almost facing hypothermia. Thanks to the quick action of concerned citizens and immediate vet care that\u2019s just a memory now.\n (We believe him to have been tied outside and neglected for quite some time before he escaped that lucky day)\nHe is a super sweet and affectionate over sized lap dog who would prefer a home where humans are generally always with him. After a taste of love, care and attention he can become anxious alone after being alone and forgotten. Junior needs to be the ONLY animal in the house as he's not good with other dogs and wouldn't be good with cats. He loves chewing on his chewy bones. Junior also knows how to sit and give paw with both paws.  \nHis adoption fee is $150.00 which includes being up to date on vaccinations including rabies, microchipped, dewormed, on flea/tick preventative and neutered.\nWe are a FOSTER based dog rescue therefore there isn't one central location with open hours to see our available dogs. They are all in loving foster homes enjoying learning how to be a furry family member. If interested we only set up meet and greets AFTER approving adoption applications with interested adopters as to not waste anyone's time.\nAll current/past pets MUST be up kept to date on vaccinations as well as being spayed/neutered to adopt from our rescue.",

I am also okay with kids, but am already a big boy and am still learning my manners. Because of this, I am looking for a home without very young kiddos.  \n\nAdditional Information: \"Hey there! My name is Bear and I'm a 4-year- old Rottweiler mix. I came to QACAS when my previous owner had to move and unfortunately not everywhere allows large dogs like me. Now I'm hoping to find a loving furever home that will be able to keep up with my crazy puppy antics. I may be 4, but I still have a lot of puppy energy.  \n\n   So here it goes. If you are looking for the most handsome and energetic pup that there ever was I'm your guy. I am an energetic goofball that loves to play. An active lifestyle would be great for me.  I'm smart as a whip, so I think that I would excel in a doggy sport. I would really thrive in a home with an active family that enjoys being out and about. While not an adoption requirement, QACAS feels that I would develop best in a home with a fenced yard or a family that went on daily walks. I am good with other dogs that I meet on a leash but can be quite a rough player, so please keep that in mind when bringing me home.  I am also okay with kids, but am already a big boy at 83lb and am still learning my manners. Because of this, I am looking for a home without very young kiddos.  \n\nCall or email: 410-827-7178, animalservices@qac.org or to submit an adoption application please visit our website\nwww.qac.org/animalservices\n\nI'd love to meet you! All animals adopted from Queen Anne's County Animal Services are spayed or neutered, vaccinated, dewormed, and microchipped. All dogs over 6 months of age are tested for heartworm and all cats are combo tested for FIV/FeLV before adoption.",

YOU CAN FIND THE APPLICATION BY TYPING IN THE FOLLOWING ADDRESS:\n                                  https://www.pawspaws.org\nThe application is under Forms.  I will arrange meet and greets after I have approved the application.  Thanks for your interest and cooperation.\n\nLilly has seen a lot in her less than two years of life.  She has had two litters of puppies already and was never loved and cuddled like she should have been.  When she first arrived, she was terribly afraid and would just try desperately to avoid any contact.  She was not a biter but would just try to melt into the wall to try to get away.  But after a few days of lots of patience and love, she began to see that being loved and cuddled was a pretty cool thing!  She has come a long way but still has a ways to go before she will fully trust and not be afraid.  She is funny and sweet and loves to play with the other dogs her size.  She loves her treats and, once she is in your arms, she loves being petted and snuggled.  She will need a quiet home with no children and no dogs larger than her.  She is looking for a home where someone will have the time and patience to continue to show her how good life can be.  She weighs 6 lbs and was born 05/02/2019.  What a treasure this baby is!  Her adoption fee is $350.",

No Other Pets including birds, cats etc I am is house trained, lived with kids ages 12+, I loves people, mellow, knows simple commands. I have had some training. I still sits and waits and waits, its been over a year. While I don't mind boarding so much, I don't want it to be my home. I really need a home. I am always so so excited when my volunteer friends come and play with me and walk me. I loves to snuggle and loves toys too! !! Please help me to find my forever home. I was in a home and did great for awhile, but the adopter ended up being allergic to me, so I was returned, no fault of my own. Please call Stephanie at 602-695-0232 rather than email to meet Happy Heidi.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this dog, please visit our website for our online application www.underdogaz.com\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This dog is courtesy posted for another individual or Rescue.

            "description": "Stanley is as cute as they come, but he is a bit of a problematic dog, so will only be adopted into a home that understands chihuahua's and is an experienced dog owner.\n\n12 pound Stanley will be best suited in an area that isn't dense in dogs, as he is quite reactive to other dogs he sees and meets.  He's young still, only 2 years old, so we're confident with an experienced handler and support from a professional trainer, Stanley can overcome his insecurities.  \n\nStanley originally came from Texas through another rescue.  He was adopted to a woman that was not dog experienced, and Stanley was a lot of dog for someone without the knowledge of handling reactive, anxious dogs.  With the lockdown, professional training support was a struggle and the adopter opted to surrender to Mattie's Place.  It was a heart wrenching decision, as she fell hopelessly in love with this boy, but the burden of care was too much with the behaviour issues Stanley came with.\n\nStanley has been bounced around quite a bit before arriving to Mattie's Place and along with that, has been given multiple names.  There's just been no consistency in this boys life and it's time we bring that to a halt and give him what he needs for stability, so he can learn to trust and grow and be the best version of himself.\n\nStanley is also very set in his ways, and will not hesitate to snap or bite if he feels you're doing something he does not approve of, such as putting on a harness, or picking him up when he's not in the mood.  He's a small dog with a lot of anxiety right now and will need time and patience to work through his insecurities, that may exist for months or years to come.\n\nHe's a feisty boy, without a doubt, but he's also incredibly loving, cuddly, loyal and an all around good boy, when he feels safe and secure.\n\nStanley's adopter will need to have incredible patience and loads of compassion.  He also does better with women than men, so a female adopter is preferable. \n\nBecause he's a bit of a jerk, no kids or regularly visiting kids, under 15 years old in the home.\n\nStanley's adopter is a female in a quiet home, that works from home (he does have separation anxiety) and doesn't have a lot of people coming and going.  Ad adopter that can put energy into helping an insecure dog become more confident and work with a professional trainer to help him overcome his areas of weakness.  You'll be rewarded with the most loyal companion you could hope to meet.\n\nMEDICAL: \n\nRight Hind Leg -- Stifle deformed -- Old injury [doesn't bother him at all, will be considered pre-existing for any future issues should they arise, with insurance]\n\nDeciduous Tooth extractions - baby teeth that never pushed out with the incoming adult teeth.  We will have these removed, at the expense of Mattie's Place, January 27th at our rescue veterinarian.\n\nFROM HIS FOSTER MOM:\n\nIt took Stanley a couple of days to settle in.  But once he got there, he transformed from a sad and angry dog into a high-energy and affectionate sweetie.  \n\nStanley is still very young, he loves to play and is very curious, he still has lots to learn.  \n\nHe\u2019s also a small guy but with a big personality.  \n\nIf things don\u2019t go his way he will make sure you know; if he wants to cuddle but your aren\u2019t available, he will walk around the house and whine, if he wants to play but you\u2019re busy, he will make noises with his squeaky toy.  \n\n____________________________________________\n\nAs of today, though our protocols could change tomorrow, we are still moving forward with adoptions. Our process has changed from some of the previous elements: We are a registered animal welfare organization, so we are deemed an essential service.\n\nAll paperwork completed online, video home visits, meet and greets outside respecting social distancing, leashes/collars/supplies wiped down and disinfected (GermiCide 3 wipes), disinfectant on the dog prior to handoff (Aqueos wipes for dogs)\n\n-----------------------\n\nTo note: the above description is relevant to this dog in his current setting. Home changes & adopter personalities can bring out different behaviours not previously seen.\n\nWe do not specifically kid/cat test our dogs when they arrive at Mattie's Place. That just wouldn't be fair to the dog or child/cat.\n\nWe also do not claim, endorse, suggest or hint at, that any of our dogs are hypoallergenic, low shed or no-shed.\n\nAdoption fee includes: spay/neuter, deworming, defleaing, vaccinations, nose to tail health exam, leash|collar, 6 months of preventative based on season/need, DNA test for entertainment purposes, dishes, poop bags, food and any extras she has accumulated in foster care.\n",

            "description": "They say to ask for what you need so here goes, I need a man and a job! I LOVE a good man and I thrive on working. \nWhen I was pregnant I was picked up by animal control and placed in a shelter. No one came to claim me. I delivered three puppies in that shelter, two of which did not survive. I was rescued from that shelter with my baby boy Solo and we moved to Colorado to start a new life. My son found a loving home and I'm looking to do the same. I am a loving momma and aunt. I enjoy running and playing with other dogs. I also LOVE running with my foster dad! \n\nMy foster parents say that I am a smart beautiful American Staffordshire Terrier mix. who enjoys playing fetch and at the end of the day snuggling on the couch. I believe I'm a lap dog, even though they tell me that my 60 pounds takes up a lot of lap. If there's a couch and a movie going, count me in! I would love to explore more of Colorado either by hiking or jogging. \n\nI am up to date with my vaccinations, wormed, microchipped, and spayed. I am also heart worm negative. My adoption fee is $300.\n\nDue to my breed mix, I am unable to live in cities and rentals who dissallow bully breeds. \n\nIf you are interested in meeting me and live in an area/situation where bully breeds are allowed, please visit the following website to complete an online application, www.innocentpawspuppyrescue.org",

            "description": "FROM THE FOSTER: Radar is an awesome dog who loves snuggles, walks, and naps. He knows basic tricks and is great in the house. He prefers to spend his days inside with his humans and would make a wonderful work-from-home companion, but he can also be left at home for a full workday without incident. Though he can be playful, his energy level is lower than the average lab. He gets along well with most other dogs, especially if they are easy-going and enjoy playing!\n\nFROM THE FOSTER: Radar is great in the car, great with my senior dog and another friends dog that was dropped off for the weekend. He LOVES the yard. Has tried to get on the furniture to get some attention. Its Obvious that he has been in a home with rules that were enforced as he listens and obeys when you call him back into the house and knows, sit, shake and down. He is house trained and working on leaving him alone for short periods and so far so good. Hes an awesome dog!.\n\nORIGINAL POST: Radar is a five (5) year old, 65 pound lab mix that was surrendered to the shelter. He is appropriately named as his one ear that pops up makes him look like he is listening in on everything. Hes in our pack in boarding now and doing well with the other dogs. He is athletic and strong, so he would do well with an owner who is the same. If you would like to foster to adopt Radar, please go to www.atlantalabrescue.com to fill on application or email an inquiry.",

What gave that away was the fact that when he came in for a checkup, they found that his collar had grown into his neck and they had to get bolt cutters to get it off. Several weeks later he came back to the vet for another visit and they found the bandages had grown into his neck. Luckily, this happy boy is not too worse for the wear and now that we have him, his chances for the life he deserves just got better. He is in boarding and in daycare. Although hes a big boy he is a little shy with people at first. Hes good with other dogs, but sometimes acts like he knows he is bigger than the rest, so he would probably be best in the home with a female dog.

            "description": "NOTE: Cooper is still in the south and not here for you to meet. He will most likely be adopted sight unseen without having a chance to be fostered up here. If you are comfortable with this type of adoption, the first step is to submit an application. Please read all about our wonderful rescue and submit an application at at www.foreverhomerescue.org\n\nAdoption coordinator Kathy \n\nLook at that polka dotted nose! This is Cooper. He is 1 yr old and weighs about 48 lbs. He was born to a stray mom. He has medium energy and will make a great walking Buddy. He likes playing with other dogs, being pet, and treats. He\u2019s shy at first, but loving once he gets to know you. He needs someone who will be patient with him and give him time to settle in. He\u2019s crate and house trained and doing well learning how to walk on a leash. He is still young, and will chew so needs to be crated when left alone. He\u2019s a beautiful young dog that will do great in an active home that has the time and patience to provide training and socialization so he be the best dog he can be. He is not a good match for the city or an apartment. Preference will be given to applicants with an enclosed fence. He hasn\u2019t been cat tested. Adoption fee $400. \n\n\n\nPlease complete an online APPLICATION if you wish to adopt.  Forever Home Rescue New England is a 501(c)3  non-profit organization. We are a network of foster homes in the South and the New England area. THERE IS NO SPECIFIC SHELTER LOCATION. If you wish to meet our dogs, you must first be approved by going through our application and screening process. Forever Home Rescue suggests obedience training for all puppies and dogs. All dogs are up to date on their shots, dewormed and spayed or neutered. Vet fees, transport fee and New England quarantine fees ARE INCLUDED in each dog's adoption fee. Also, any dogs older than pups--even if they are not marked housetrained in their posting---usually housetrain within a day or two, because most are used to living outside in the south and will prefer to do their business outdoors. Our dogs and pups are best suited for families with children 5 yrs old and up. If you are approved to adopt, please submit the $100 deposit by clicking on our rescue's name in this posting (Forever Home Rescue New England--in purple) which will bring you to a new page with the deposit link at the bottom.  STOP! If you have not been notified of your approval status do not make a deposit.",

Hope is approximately 3 years old and weighs about 50lbs.  So far she has made great progress with a way to go.  She is looking for a home that can be patient with her and help her with potty training outside (pee pads are her jam right now).  Hope is the sweetest girl and loves her stuffed animals. She is ready to share her love with a family. \n\nOur adoption application can be found at www.peachesbullyrescue.com/adopting along with all the information on the adoption process and fee range.",

She was adopted from a shelter 9 months ago, and has\nbecome a well-behaved dog since then. She is crate trained, walks on\nthe leash without pulling, and doesn't chew things up. She loves\nhikes, going swimming, and playing with other dogs. She loves\neveryone, which is wonderful! She was very scared in the shelter, and\nwas terrified of people when we first met us, but now she's pretty\nfearless. Ripley has lived in a house with cats, and we think she's\nokay with them, but she's exuberant so cats aren't okay with her.\nRipley loves other dogs, and does well with calm yet playful dogs. She\nhas a lot of energy and can overwhelm some of her friends. She loves\nto snuggle with her humans, enjoys her chew toys and playing tug. She\neats well but isn't food obsessed. She has really blossomed in the\nlast 9 months, and would make an amazing companion for someone active\nand experienced with pit bull terriers. Her owner had sudden health\nproblems and can't care for her, so I am helping to find a good home.\nWe travel between the Carrboro/Chapel Hill area, and Asheville. If you\nsound like a good match, I'm happy to travel to either area.\nShe is 45 lbs, spayed, and up to date on her vaccinations.\n\nPlease call or email with any questions you might have about this sweet girl!",

Diesel is an amazing dog. Loves people, males and females. Enjoys kids. Hardly barks and loves dog walks. He likes to play ball and chase it, he likes to be brushed and doesn't mind being bathed. Diesel did very well in foster for the holidays. We are considering Diesel as special needs with his thyroid condition that will require further follow up with the adopters veterinarian. This is a life long medical issue that will need to be maintained. Our shelter veterinarian has reached a point where she feels Diesel needs an adopter that can find Diesel his own veterinarian to take over care his care. Diesel has a zest for life and so much to offer his people. This guy has done a complete 180! Arriving at the shelter with terrible skin, an out of control untreated thyroid issue, so uncomfortable he didn't want to get up and depressed to the point of not eating. To see him now is amazing! Don't miss out on meeting this sweet face.",

Lucas is a tripod, so he will require a home with little to no stairs. In addition, because traditional leash-walking isn't the best way for him to get his exercise, he will also require a home with a six-foot, secure (husky secure) fence.\nLucas gets along well with dogs his size and also loves people. He does not, as is normal with this breed, like cats. He should not be in a home with them and, preferably, small dogs.\nIf you are interested in learning more about Lucas, please email his foster mom, bjames@westga.edu. She can provide you with much more specific information about the home that is best for him and walk you through the adoption process.\nOnly those with breed experience should apply. He is fully vetted and microchipped, and his adoption fee is $500.",

I enjoy taunting you to throw my toys, while making alien noises and never giving them up long enough to be thrown. I am very bossy with other dogs and cats look like moving snacks, so I would prefer to be the only apple of your eye. I really need to lose some weight and good grooming is a must. I would love equal amounts of walking, hoarding my toys and snuggling. Come see me, soon!\n\nAdoption fee: $200\n\nFor an application to adopt this pet, please visit our website! www.heavenafterhellrescue.org \nOnce approved to adopt, the adoption fee can be paid in cash or check.\n \nAdoption includes:\n \nSpay or neuter\nHeartworm test\nAge appropriate vaccines\nRabies\nBordetella\nAge appropriate wormer\nFlea Preventative\nHeartworm preventative\nMicrochip w/registration\n \nWe cannot hold animals more than 7 days after we receive a deposit as we don't want them to miss out on a forever home.\nAdopters are required to come to us to meet the pets.

She was adopted in September 2019 to a local family. Because of her skittish  nature, the family lost her on the same day of adoption. Bug was missing for over a year. \n\nIn December 2020 we saw a social media post about a dog that had been living in a horse pasture and had taken up shelter in a den type brush pile. The dog was extremely skittish and would not go to anyone. FAHR was asked to help and within two days we were able to trap her. The dog was scanned for a microchip and the chip was registered to Bug. We couldn\u2019t believe that Bug was still alive and had traveled 20+ miles. \n\nSince trapping Bug she has been in a foster home learning how to acclimate to life indoors and learning how to trust humans. Bug is a very shy and skittish girl.  After being in foster for nearly two months she has moments of being confident but will quickly revert back to being shy and scared. She is happy and manageable most of the time but when she gets scared she will keep her distance. \n\nBug is a mini aussie, six years old and is house and kennel trained. The perfect family would be someone who has the understanding and patience needed to acclimate a shy and skittish dog to a new environment. We prefer Bug have a tall, secure privacy fence and must have another dog(s) in the home that is confident and can show her the way. Bug may do well with older kids or teens but feel young kids and toddlers may be too overwhelming for her. She is house and kennel trained and loves being with her pack of furry foster siblings. \n\nBug\u2019s adoption fee is $300. This includes spay, vaccinations, microchip, dewormer and maintaining heartworm prevention while in our care.\n\nIf you would like to be selected for a meeting with our girl, please submit an online adoption application by copying the link below into your browser. \n\nhttps://form.jotformpro.com/50153632350949\n",

I can be hesitant with people I don't know, so I'm more of a homebody than social butterfly. I'm hoping to find a low-traffic home that will suit my quiet personality. I need a home where all kids are at least school age. Since I get a tad nervous with noises and meeting new people, I'm probably not cut out for apartment-living. I'm a dog that loves my people and prefers not to share them with any other furry friends in the home. I may be a social butterfly when I see other dogs while out on walks. I would just prefer to be the furry king of my new forever home. I need to meet all family members in the home to make sure it's a perfect match. Quavo will be shown by appointment only.

Ok, so we don't have many beaches or any mountains nearby, but the point is I want to be with you every step of the way. Whether that's going on an adventure, playing in the backyard, or cuddling on the couch. And I am smart too. The shelter staff are teaching me all sorts of things and my adoption comes with FREE classes to help you continue my education. My ideal family will have a house (no apartments!), and any kids will need to be over 12 years old. I also would prefer to be the only dog for you to love on, but a social male dog might be okay, too. I just want to make sure I get to meet everyone in the family, both human and canine, to make sure we're a good match! Rolo is a Diamond Dog and will be shown by appointment only. Diamond Dogs are dogs that are currently receiving special training from staff and volunteers through our behavior modification program.

That feature is a default with petfinder, and is not a part of our adoption process.\n\nThe first step in our adoption process is the application.  Completed applications take priority over inquiries.  To apply to adopt, please copy and paste the following url:\n\nhttps://fs30.formsite.com/legacygsd/form4/index.html\n\nIntroducing Possum.  This cutie-patootie is a Peke/Schipperke mix.  He's around 7-8 yrs old and weighs 12lbs. \n\nPossum is blind from early onset cataracts. It doesn't slow him down one bit! He can navigate the house and yard with ease.  He's good with other dogs.  He's got 4 little canine buddies he likes to go outside with. He's fine with dog savvy cats.  If they don't mess with him he doesn't mess with them.  \n\nWhen Possum arrived at the shelter he was naked. With medicated baths and melatonin he fluffed right up. All except his tail.  It's naked with the exception of a few wild random hairs.  Hence the name Possum.  He's got a little curly possum tail. \n\nPossum is the sweetest boy!  He loves to be held and loved on.  He's a cuddle bug and enjoys lots of TLC from his people.  He is crate trained and does pretty well in the house when taken out regularly.  Possum would do best in a home with a fenced yard.  He doesn't really care for a leash. Having a yard that is familiar is best because he'll learn to navigate it with ease.  Possum is currently in an adult home and would do best in an adult home or home with children 12yr and over. \n\nOther than being blind and having a naked tail Possum is in good health. He's neutered, is vaccinated, tested for heartworms and 5 diseases spread by ticks,  is microchipped and on monthly heartworm and flea prevention.\n\nAs with all of our dogs, we recommend a basic obedience class to help him understand what is expected of him, and this also helps with the bonding process. \n\nPossum\u2019s adoption fee is $475, which covers all his vetting, preventatives, fostering costs and other associated expenses.  We do not adopt to anyone under the age of 21.\n\n",

She is 4 years old, current on shots, and just a sweetheart. She loves playing with toys and soaking up body rubs and affection. Maybe you have the most amazing loving FOREVER home for sweet Minnie?! Stop by for a visit with this pretty girl and give her a fabulous life with you! \nIf you have another dog and are interested in meeting another potential new furry member please bring him or her to the shelter and meet on neutral ground before adopting. No need to shuffle the animals around any more than necessary. Please know that 1 mosquito bite can create heart worms and they can be fatal if not treated. It is VERY important to keep your pets healthy and protected by keeping them on a once a month heart worm and flea/tick prevention. These animals are counting on you as their owner to provide them with lots a love and the proper health care so PLEASE make sure you are aware and prepared before adopting. Owning a pet is an extra expense and responsibility but is so worth every minute and penny you invest in them. They will add lots of joy and unconditional love if given a fair chance.\nThe shelter is open Mon.-Fri. 10-1, 2-5 and Sat. 10-4. Adopt a homeless pet and save a life. If you can not adopt right now come out and volunteer and make a difference in the lives of these animals while they await their FOREVER home.",

He is a year old and weighs 65 pounds but needs to gain about 10 pounds. He is very calm and quiet in the house. He loves people and seeks attention. He will sit in front of you, offer his \"Pyr paw,\" and try to crawl onto your lap for pets and cuddles! Duffy was a stray. He is an escape artist and needs a securely fenced yard. He would also do well in a condo or townhome. Duffy is learning how to be a family dog. He does not take treats from hands (although he loves his food) and does not know what to do with toys. Duffy did well with his bath and was perfect for his pedicure. He offered his paws to the groomer and enjoyed the attention! Duffy is reliably house-trained. He sleeps and eats baby-gated in a small room. He has nice house manners and will likely do well loose in the house. He does not beg at the table or chew inappropriately. Duffy knows \"sit\" and \"shake.\" He walks very well on leash and rides well in the car. He gets along with dogs of as long as they don't get in his face. He can live in a home with or without other dogs. This sweetie is ready for his forever family! Duffy is currently in Texas but can be on the next NW transport.\n\nAll our dogs require secure VISIBLE fencing. All current pets in adoptive home must be spayed/neutered and up to date on vaccinations.\n\nAdoption Fee: $350\n\nAll of our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped and up to date on vaccinations.\n\nTransport Fee: $300\n\nTransport fee includes the cost of transport plus the Health Certificate required for USDA approved transport.\n\nAdoption applications can be found on our website: www.greatpyrsandpaws.org\n\nhttps://greatpyrsandpaws.rescuegroups.org/forms/form?formid=5959\n\nNorthwest adopter pays cost of transport to independent transport company. Transport is arranged by GPPR.",

We are not taking out of territory inquiries at this time.\n\nBandit was rescued from an auction of breeding dogs. He is learning to overcome his fear of humans and will need a medium to large, confident dog in his forever home as a mentor as well as a playmate. Bandit can live with cats. A physical fence is required to keep him safe, and any children in the home must be at least 13. \n\nBandit's foster mom stated:\nBandit has taken more baby steps. The most exciting is that he will come during the early morning hours while I am still in bed and let me scratch his chest and rub his face! It is a thrill every morning now as he leans into my hand for more.\n\nI could lay there for hours if my residents weren't so persistent in trying to get me up. Of course, when I do start to get up, he runs back to his safe dog bed in the bedroom and waits. He won't let me pet him for that long anywhere else.\n\nBandit has also started taking treats from friends that visit outdoors. I have two friends that he has seen several times-in our pod. Check out the video where he takes a treat from my friend Jill even as she is standing up!\n\nSo I am not without hope for Mr Bandit. Hope that he will find his forever family, hope that he will allow the morning love to spread to other parts of the day. \n\nIf you have another medium to large dog, a fence, patience, and most of all good experience with extremely fearful dogs, please consider this sweet boy.\n\nTo learn more about Bandit, see his bio at: https://ragom.org/dogs/bandit-20-043a\n\nPlacement Requirements:\nGood With Dogs: Yes-Required\nGood With Cats: Yes\nGood With Kids: 13+\nFence: Physical Fence Required\nAge: 3\n\nIf you are interested in any of the dogs available at Retrieve a Golden of the Midwest (RAGOM), you can read our adoption process and apply to adopt, which can be found at https://ragom.org/our-adoption-process.\n\nRAGOM\u2019s adoption territory includes: Minnesota; Iowa; North Dakota; South Dakota; Western Wisconsin (within 75 miles of the Minnesota border).\u00a0 We are not taking out of territory inquiries at this time.",

He is 1 year 5 months old, current on shots, already neutered, and just a happy playful young fella who is excited to meet his new person or family.  Maybe you have the most amazing loving home for this charming fella?! Stop by the shelter for a visit with MHKai today and adopt him into your heart and home! \nIf you have another dog and are interested in meeting another potential new furry member please bring him or her to the shelter and meet on neutral ground before adopting. No need to shuffle the animals around any more than necessary. Please know that 1 mosquito bite can create heart worms and they can be fatal if not treated. It is VERY important to keep your pets healthy and protected by keeping them on a once a month heart worm and flea/tick prevention. These animals are counting on you as their owner to provide them with lots a love and the proper health care so PLEASE make sure you are aware and prepared before adopting. Owning a pet is an extra expense and responsibility but is so worth every minute and penny you invest in them. They will add lots of joy and unconditional love if given a fair chance.\nThe shelter is open Mon.-Fri. 10-1, 2-5 and Sat. 10-4. Adopt a homeless pet and save a life. If you can not adopt right now come out and volunteer and make a difference in the lives of these animals while they await their FOREVER home.",

We are not taking out of territory inquiries at this time.\n\nTeea came into RAGOM from a commercial breeding environment. Teea is a healthy girl who is skittish and unsure of the new world she is in, but she is making small steps forward to learn and grow. Because of her skittishness, she cannot live with children. Teea requires another medium to large, confident dog in her home for her to model and learn about being a house dog. Teea requires a physical fence to keep her safe. She seeks a patient, adult home where she can learn to be the best dog she can be.\n\nTo learn more about Teea, see her bio at: https://ragom.org/dogs/teea-20-055\n\nPlacement Requirements:\nGood With Dogs: Yes-Required\nGood With Cats: Not Tested\nGood With Kids: No Children in the home\nFence: Physical Fence Required\nAge: 4\n\nIf you are interested in any of the dogs available at Retrieve a Golden of the Midwest (RAGOM), you can read our adoption process and apply to adopt, which can be found at https://ragom.org/our-adoption-process.\n\nRAGOM\u2019s adoption territory includes: Minnesota; Iowa; North Dakota; South Dakota; Western Wisconsin (within 75 miles of the Minnesota border).\u00a0 We are not taking out of territory inquiries at this time.",

I\u2019m looking for a forever family. Do you have one to share?\n\nMy foster dad says I\u2019m the best dog he\u2019s ever fostered, period. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised. I\u2019m an expert cuddler, a world-class kisser, and an award-winning snuggle-buddy! I get along great with other dogs and am gentle with kids too. What\u2019s not to love?!\n\nBefore coming to the rescue, I tested positive for heartworms. I\u2019ve been through treatment and I\u2019m doing great, but I\u2019ll need a vet visit soon to make sure I\u2019m fully recovered.\n\nAre you ready to meet your new best friend? I can\u2019t wait to show you all my good boy moves!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Alfie, please DO NOT SEND A MESSAGE TO OUR RESCUE GROUP.  We are too busy placing dogs in great homes to answer messages and inquiries through the listing site.  \n\nPLEASE GO TO THE LINK BELOW TO COMPLETE AN ADOPTION APPLICATION.\n \nwww.chihuahua-rescue.com/adoption-application\n \nCRT requires an approved adoption application and a home visit for all adoption applicants.

We are not taking out of territory inquiries at this time.\n\nJanene (called JoJo by her foster family) was surrendered to RAGOM by a commercial breeder. She has become accustomed to gentle petting and snuggling, but typical of former breeder dogs, she is afraid of most things and takes her cues from other dogs. Therefore, she will need a medium to large, confident dog in her forever home. JoJo can live with older children (age 13 or older) who are respectful of animals, and she is fine with cats. A physical fence is required to keep her safe.\n\nTo learn more about Janene, see her bio at: https://ragom.org/dogs/janene-20-037a\n\nPlacement Requirements:\nGood With Dogs: Yes-Required\nGood With Cats: Yes\nGood With Kids: 13+\nFence: Physical Fence Required\nAge: 4\n\nIf you are interested in any of the dogs available at Retrieve a Golden of the Midwest (RAGOM), you can read our adoption process and apply to adopt, which can be found at https://ragom.org/our-adoption-process.\n\nRAGOM\u2019s adoption territory includes: Minnesota; Iowa; North Dakota; South Dakota; Western Wisconsin (within 75 miles of the Minnesota border).\u00a0 We are not taking out of territory inquiries at this time.",

We are not taking out of territory inquiries at this time.\n\nChloe (previously known as Tessy) first came into RAGOM in December 2019 from a breeder. She was returned in November 2020 by her adoptive family due to her skittishness. In addition to lots of love and patience, Chloe will need a medium to large, confident dog in her forever home as her mentor and companion, as well as a physical fence to keep her safe. Any children in the home must be over 10 and dog-savvy. Chloe has not been tested with cats.\n\nWhen Chloe first came into foster care, she met the foster's former breeder dogs like she knew them! Her foster said \"I still think these dogs understand when another dog is a former breeder dog and are so gentle with them\". Chloe loves to run around the yard with the resident dogs. When she gets excited, she jumps into the air and does a 360-degree turn, then comes running. \n\nChloe is a very sweet dog, but doesn\u2019t quite trust people yet. She will take a treat from her foster's hand and will let her pet her, but she doesn\u2019t come to her foster yet for attention or treats. \n\nChloe needs a quiet home where her adopter will have patience to help her come out of her shell.\n\nTo learn more about Chloe view her bio at: https://ragom.org/dogs/chloe-tessy-19-253\n\nPlacement Requirements:\nGood With Dogs: Yes-Required\nGood With Cats: Not Tested\nGood With Kids: 10+\nFence: Physical Fence Required\nAge: 2\n\nIf you are interested in any of the dogs available at Retrieve a Golden of the Midwest (RAGOM), you can read our adoption process and apply to adopt, which can be found at https://ragom.org/our-adoption-process.\n\nRAGOM\u2019s adoption territory includes: Minnesota; Iowa; North Dakota; South Dakota; Western Wisconsin (within 75 miles of the Minnesota border)\u00a0.

I'd love to have a home with other bigger dogs to play with. I'm a five-star player, and chasing another dog around the yard would be the best! But if you don't have any siblings for me, that's okay. I really like going to the dog park, meeting new friends on walks and the company of humans just fine. I could live with older kids, but since I'm a bigger guy, and I get a bit excited easily, younger, small kids I might knock over. My favorite toys are ropes for tug-o-war, anything that squeaks and good, old-fashioned sticks. I'm the goodest boy and don't have accidents in the house, but my foster mom still kennels me when she's gone because I think everything is a toy. My foster mom says I'm good on a leash, and I have the energy and fitness to keep up on jogs, hikes and nice, long walks. I tend to chase critters and pull to meet new dog friends, but I'm just being friendly! I listen when you say it's time to move on. At home, I'm the most loving pup. I love to curl up for a tv binge session, sit beside you while you work, or cuddle next to you for a nap. The more we overlap, the better! If you're looking for a new best friend or biggest fan, look no further. I'm your guy!\n\nAlbert's Dog Lounge is a transporting dog rescue, meaning that we rescue many of our dogs from high kill shelters in areas of dog overpopulation. We are a specialty rescue focusing primarily on senior and special needs dogs.  The vast majority of our dogs come from the Houston, TX area where we have an entire team of volunteers, coordinators, and fosters. We do also work with local shelters, rescues, and owners.  If you apply for a dog that is currently in our local Houston program, we will work to get your dog transported to WI as quickly as possible. We ask that you have patience during this time of uncertainty and unprecedented dog adoptions nationwide. \n\nLearn more about Albert's Dog Lounge, our mission, and adoption policies by visiting Albertsdoglounge.org. \n\nOur process includes an approved application, reference checks, a homevisit, and then a meet and greet with the dog. Adoption fee is $275.\n\nBegin your application process by copying this link into your web browser: https://www.albertsdoglounge.org/apply\n\nWI Dept. Of Agriculture License Number: 474085-DS",

She requires a cat-free home.  \n\nShe enjoys playing ball, and  lived compatibly with another dog.  Her owners reported that she has always been good with their young children.\n\nShe is a high energy dog, and will require additional training as she pulls on the leash.\n\nIf you have a dog, a \u201cmeet \u2019n greet\" is required.\n\nElsa may be housebroken since she keeps her kennel clean.\n\nElsa will need to be spayed before going home with you.\n\nContact : Calaveras County Animal Services (209) 754-6509\n\nor Kbandy@co.calaveras.ca.us or svavzincak@co.calaveras.ca.us",

Dodger goes through a lot of toys so anything that is durable is best for him.\n\nWhile we aren't sure how he will respond to cats, he does get along very well with his foster siblings. (He has 5 of them!). He also loves children.\n\nDodger has had a rough go over the last few months. He is currently post heartworm treatment and will need some special attention over the next month. Dodger previously had a few cysts removed but he is good now. He cannot hear well as complications with his ears when he came to the rescue.\n\nDodger is like a brand new dog!

He is very good at fetch too! He is learning how to walk on a leash better because everything is just so exciting and it's soooo hard to keep walking nicely when you just want to bounce around and play.\n\nLubby is good with other dogs and we think that he will do well with older kids- he may be too hyper and jumpy for younger kids.\n\nIf you are interested in Lubby, fill out an application at\nwww.fayettehumane.org/adopt/dogapplication\n\nDue to COVID-19, we are not able to facilitate meet and greets until a family is approved and then only at the foster family's discretion.

            "description": "Meet Ernst! \n\nMr Ernst is an approximately 10 year old, 17 pound Shih Tzu. He has the cutest face and rocks his snaggletooth. Mr. Ernst just loves to be by his people; he is great with adults and older kids. His very favorite thing is belly rubs. When you first meet him he will likely roll right over to ask for those belly scratches. His second favorite thing is naps - he's a pro and even likes cuddling in bed at night with his humans. He does great on car rides too! Ernst gets along with both large and small dogs, but only if they are laid back like he is - he gets grumpy if a dog is too much in his personal space, and prefers to eat by himself. He gets very excited about cats, so would do best in a home without them. He is not perfectly potty trained; although he goes potty every time you let him outside, he will sometimes lift a leg inside as well. He has no problem wearing a belly band, which completely solves that issue. Unfortunately Ernst has a grade 5/6 heart murmur and has been diagnosed with \"mitral valve insufficiency\". He is currently taking two medications at a total cost of about $50 per month to help his heart work better. The good news is he is not showing any outward symptoms of this. He will need another echocardiogram in 6 months to see how things are going. All Ernst wants is someone to give him love, care, and belly scratches in his golden years. Could it be you?\n\nAlbert's Dog Lounge is a transporting dog rescue, meaning that we rescue many of our dogs from high kill shelters in areas of dog overpopulation. We are a specialty rescue focusing primarily on senior and special needs dogs.  The vast majority of our dogs come from the Houston, TX area where we have an entire team of volunteers, coordinators, and fosters. We do also work with local shelters, rescues, and owners.  If you apply for a dog that is currently in our local Houston program, we will work to get your dog transported to WI as quickly as possible. We ask that you have patience during this time of uncertainty and unprecedented dog adoptions nationwide. \n\nLearn more about Albert's Dog Lounge, our mission, and adoption policies by visiting Albertsdoglounge.org. \n\nOur process includes an approved application, reference checks, a homevisit, and then a meet and greet with the dog. Adoption fee is $275.\n\nBegin your application process by copying this link into your web browser: https://www.albertsdoglounge.org/apply\n\nWI Dept. Of Agriculture License Number: 474085-DS",

My foster mom moistens dry kibble for me and I eat that ok. I get scared in new places and with new people and will run and hide. Once I trust you, I will seek your attention and love to be cuddled with. I like other dogs, especially laying with them. They make me feel safe! I have been around cats and I don't mind them one bit. Children make me nervous and I do not want to live with them. They can visit sometimes but I will want a safe place to hide. \n\nI use potty pads in doors to go potty and do not like the cold. Sometimes I have accidents and do not always make it to the potty pad. \n\n The vet I went to says I am healthy and ready for a home! If I sound like someone you would like to have around, then complete an application!\n\nAdopt Banana for $200. We require an approved application, a meet and greet and a home check before an adoption will be finalized. All dogs are up to date on vaccines, heart worm tested and on prevention, spayed/neutered and microchipped. \n\nApplications can be found on our Facebook page, within Petfinder by clicking on our rescue name, emailing us, or by copying and pasting the link below in your web browser.\nvhttps://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/LHCR/Dog\n",

            "description": "Click my picture for more info. on me!\nMeet Orla!\n\nOrla is looking for her forever home! She is a one year old German Shepherd mix who loves to play, play, play! She loves other medium to larger breed dogs who will play with her, but she can be quite vocal when she first meets strangers. She has not figured out that BARK BARK BARK is not the best way to greet new friends. She loves to wrestle and would love a home with someone (dog or human) who will play with her. However, the greeting does not extend to cats- she LOVES to chase cats!\n\nShe came to us a few months ago after being hit by a car and limping on her broken lower leg for days. A few months of splints, many many X-rays, and lots of rest, and she's really to find her forever home. Orla has been a trooper throughout and has loved everyone she has met! Because of her prey drive, we think that a fenced in yard is needed. She has already had one accident in her life and does not need another!\n\nOrla is a very loyal girl and will follow you everywhere you go. She is sweet and gentle, but she can get rambunctious while playing. She ADORES belly rubs and will flop down into your lap for one. Personal space? Noooo! That's not a thing! She will pick up her leash and walk with it to the door to tell you when she wants to go out. Orla us almost housetrained and has only had a few accidents.\n\nIf you are interested in her, fill out an application at\nwww.fayettehumane.org/adopt/dogapplication\n\nDue to COVID-19, we are not able to facilitate meet and greets until a family is approved and then only at the foster family's discretion. At this time, we are not holding dog adoptions at Petsmart.\n\n**Applications can take anywhere from 5-7 business days to complete. When filling out an application, please scroll down after submitting it to be sure that the website accepted it and check for a confirmation email to be sure that your application went through. We respond by email, so please check your spam and trash folders.**\n\nWe are located in Fayette County, GA and are a foster based rescue without a shelter building.\n\nEstimated DOB: 09/29/2019\nAdoption fee: $300\n\nCLICK HERE to APPLY TO ADOPT\nor paste the following link in your browser: https://fayettehumane.org/adopt/dogapplication\nFor full details about ADOPTING, please visit our Adoption Guide (https://fayettehumane.org/adoption-information/adoption-guide/).\n\nAll our dogs are tested for heartworms, spayed/neutered, up-to-date on age appropriate vaccines and flea prevention.\n\nCats are tested for FLV/FIV when age appropriate, as kittens tested at an age less than 16 weeks tends to lead to unreliable results. All our cats are spayed/neutered, up-to-date on age appropriate vaccines and flea prevention.",

This handsome boy came into the shelter as a stray.  Ace is a pretty chill dog overall.  He goes with the flow of what you want to do.  If you want to go for a hike, he will go for a  hike.  If you want to snuggle up with him, he will snuggle up with you.  Overall, we consider him a couch potato who is getting ready to watch the super bowl with his family.\n\nAce is pretty good on leash and loves to play with other dogs.  He does not require having another dog in the home though.  He would do fine alone.  Ace loves his squeaky toys and would be content running in the backyard with you.  \n\nHe is waiting patiently for his forever family to apply for him.  Ace is ready to give you lots of love and snuggles!!!\n\nIf interested in Ace, please email to inquire at: SCREENING.FETCHINGHEARTS@GMAIL.COM OR COPY LINK BELOW TO APPLY AND FILL OUT AN APPLICATION: https://www.fetchingheartsrescue.org/adoption-form-online to fill out an application.\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, all dogs adopted through Fetching Hearts have received the following before being available for adoption:\n\nThorough veterinary examination\n\nAll routine annual vaccinations, including Rabies, DHLPP, Bordatella (Kennel Cough), Heartworm Test, Fecal Test, Deworming, Microchip, Flea and Tick Prevention and Heartworm Prevention.\n\nSpay/Neuter\nAll dogs are quarantined for two weeks outside of the shelter (puppies four weeks) to ensure they don't break with disease.\n\nVETTING NOTE: Fetching Hearts Rescue completely vets our dogs thoroughly to the best of our knowledge based on communication with our Southern Vets.

We can't believe someone didn't go to the pound to reclaim him!  He's so incredibly sweet and a great size at right around 50 pounds.  \n\nAlpine seems to like other dogs just fine.  He is good on a leash and would love to be your next partner for adventure!  Alpine isn't currently living in a foster home, so we are unsure of his level of housetraining.  \n\nAlpine is very outgoing and just a sweetie!  He certainly deserves a home, and soon!\n\n\nAlpine's adoption fee is $450 which includes his neuter, current vaccinations, negative heartworm test, registered microchip, and transport costs.\n\nHe is available through Paw Pals of Hale Center in Hale Center, TX through Project Freedom Ride. He would be transported on one of the PFR transports (next transport is March 4) to either Seattle, WA, Mt Vernon, WA, or Portland, OR.  For more information on how a Direct Adoption with Project Freedom Ride works or to meet this guy via video call, email pawpalshc@gmail.com.\n\n\n\nAs a Project Freedom Ride direct adoption, the adoption interview/meet and greet would take place on video call (FB Messenger Call, Whats App, or Google Duo). The adoption application and fee would be finalized prior to transport.\n\nAdoption application can be accessed at the link below.\n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/83483621192155\n\n\nCheck out Project Freedom Ride and see what this amazing group is all about!\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ProjectFreedomRide/\n\nhttp://projectfreedomride.org/\n\n\n",

We have their pedigrees but sadly they were unclaimed strays at a high kill shelter in GA. Umai the male is about 65 lbs and skinny. Zashi is 68 lbs. Umai needs some work on a leash and Zashi is great on a leash. Not tested with kids or other animals. We will not adopt Akita\u2019s to same sex large DOG households- Akita\u2019s have a tendency for same sex dog aggression . These are a bonded pair. To adopt, complete an application. No phone calls. Located in Carnesville GA\n\nUmai is Heartworm negative but Zashi is Heartworm positive and will be treated prior to adoption.\n\nwww.georgiaakitarescuedivision.org",

            "description": "Rosie Mamma is a very energetic dog who loves nothing more than a good ball! She will play with any kind, from tennis balls to soccer balls and anything in between. She seems to prefer something a bit oversized so she can chase and paw at it, but she won't complain about a regular size ball. Rosie loves to fetch, and when she needs a break she will flop into the grass for a chew or a tummy rub. She is very strong and will need to work on her leash manners. She enjoys treats, but nothing beats out her toys. Rosie's previous owners said she was dog selective, but we believe she would be best as the only dog based on her introductions here. She does attend playgroup, but she would prefer to have her home to herself because she does require supervision and management. She has shown a lot of interest in cats and small animals, so she would be best as the only animal. Rosie has lived with children twice and likes them very much! \n\nRosie is a part of our Sit, Stay, Adopt! program due to some behavioral challenges. She is fearful/reactive to strangers, especially men, and will need behavior modification training to work on this. At the shelter, she is working on wearing a basket muzzle, appropriate engagement, and positive reinforcement of appropriate behaviors. She will take a dedicated owner and a special home to succeed, but we know that her person is out there! Our behavior consultant will arrange for meetings with interested adopters to help Rosie get comfortable and find her forever home.",

She came to us via a local animal shelter and was in need of rescue.  She will need puppy/potty training and continued socialization, etc. since she is still just a baby.   \n\nKahlua is a very high energy puppy and will need a lot of exercise and mental stimulation.  She would probably be happiest and do the best in a home with another higher energy younger dog to play with and a fenced in yard.  She does great with kids also.  She will need an active person/family in order to keep up with her.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting please complete our Adoption Application by copying and pasting the following link into your web browser: http://www.caninecastaways.org/adoption-application\n\nFor a full list of dogs we currently have for adoption use this link:  https://www.caninecastaways.org/adoptable-dogs\n\n\nMEDICAL INFO:\n\n\nThe following has been or will be done for this puppy at the appropriate age...\n- Basic Exam by Veterinarian\n- Spayed or Neutered\n- Placed on heartworm preventive\n- Basic Bloodwork\n- Microchipped\n- Intestinal Parasite Exam and medication\n- Vaccinations\n- Placed on flea preventive\n\n\nADOPTION DONATION: $300\n\n\nThis adoption donation helps to cover the vet expenses for this puppy including heartworm preventive which is dispensed at the initial vet visit and then goes with the dog at adoption. All vet records will be provided to adopter.\n\nVisit us at www.caninecastaways.org",

Hudson is a strikingly handsome White English Setter who traveled here from Turkey after one of our rescuers found him in a local shelter. Being an English Setter, Hudson  prances and stands with great elegance. He ADORES EVERYONE, children and people young and old and greets all with an enthusiastic smile and snuggles. Hudson is a 3 year old neutered male who gets along well with other dogs and cats and shows zero aggression. His sweet, loving, joyful nature is a pleasure to be around. He does have energy and would do best in a home with a yard to play in and a few long walks a day. Hudson is currently being fostered in a home with another young dog and enjoys playtime with his foster brother. Therefore, we are looking for a home for Hudson with another playful dog. \n\nHudson is also being fostered in a home with cats and gets along flawlessly with them. He is potty trained and shows no bad habits of barking or chewing and is crate trained as well although he\u2019s just as happy to sleep in your bed to snuggle! Although Hudson has not had any accidents in his foster home..he will need gentle reminders of the proper place to go in his new home. \n\n Hudson is still learning basic obedience skills and is gaining ground on sit, stay, down and come but does pull on the leash unless walked with a harness or gentle leader. He\u2019s an eager learner however and very treat motivated. He also enjoys car rides A LOT and would be happy to join you on any journeys. Will the next step of his journey be with you?\n\nPlease note: Hudson is being fostered in San Diego, CA. Due to the high cost of travel, Hudson\u2019s adoption fee is $1,000. \n\nIf you are interested in making Hudson a part of your family, please head over to our website www.roversretreat.org to fill out an adoption application.",

            "description": "Winn-Dixie is a wonderful family dog! We think this 2 year old sweetheart is a Pit Bull Terrier mix with maybe Labrador Retriever. She is currently fostered with a family with two kids - 6 and 9 years old - and they can run with her, play fetch, build forts and give her snacks with no hesitation. She loves to snuggle, and if given the chance, sleeps right next to you. She enjoys going on adventures with her foster family, whether sledding down the hill in the snow or frolicking at the beach. She's a total San Diego dog! Winn Dixie is learning her basic commands, including Sit, Come and Stay. She is housetrained, eager to please, and walks well on leash. She loves her walks and needs a somewhat active family that will help her get her energy out. She will need a forever home with a yard for her to do her zoomies in. She can be left in her crate during the day for a few hours with no issues. She likes to chase kitties and we think she'd be happiest as the only dog in the home but is nonreactive to other dogs on walks. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting Winn Dixie, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs. Thank you for rescuing.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue.

            "description": "Looking for some fun and adventure in 2021? Winn-Dixie's Pups would be happy to be by your side every step of the way. These precious Pit Bull Terrier mixes are almost 2 months old and they can't wait to meet their forever families. There are a bunch of different colored pups in this litter with varying amounts of oh so squishy wrinkles so they are likely mixes of many breeds. It's possible there could be some Lab in them but we don't know for sure. Their mama, Winn-Dixie, is a gorgeous and super sweet girl who weighs about 45 lbs. We don't know who dad is but we are guessing these pups will be large like their mom when all grown up. Snoopy is looking for a family that understands the time, patience, and energy needed to raise a young pup. We require all puppy adopters to provide training that includes: house training, basic training, leash training, and socialization. Additionally, this cutie is going to need proper exercise, mental stimulation, and your attention and love to grow up to be the best companion. We do not allow our dogs or puppies to sleep or live outside; they must be incorporated into your family and be made a priority in your life. In return, you will have the most loving and loyal family member you could ask for. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting a puppy, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt.

            "description": "Looking for some fun and adventure in 2021? Winn-Dixie's Pups would be happy to be by your side every step of the way. These precious Pit Bull Terrier mixes are almost 2 months old and they can't wait to meet their forever families. There are a bunch of different colored pups in this litter with varying amounts of oh so squishy wrinkles so they are likely mixes of many breeds. It's possible there could be some Lab in them but we don't know for sure. Their mama, Winn-Dixie, is a gorgeous and super sweet girl who weighs about 45 lbs. We don't know who dad is but we are guessing these pups will be large like their mom when all grown up. Sandy is looking for a family that understands the time, patience, and energy needed to raise a young pup. We require all puppy adopters to provide training that includes: house training, basic training, leash training, and socialization. Additionally, this cutie is going to need proper exercise, mental stimulation, and your attention and love to grow up to be the best companion. We do not allow our dogs or puppies to sleep or live outside; they must be incorporated into your family and be made a priority in your life. In return, you will have the most loving and loyal family member you could ask for. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting a puppy, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs.

            "description": "Looking for some fun and adventure in 2021? Winn-Dixie's Pups would be happy to be by your side every step of the way. These precious Pit Bull Terrier mixes are almost 2 months old and they can't wait to meet their forever families. There are a bunch of different colored pups in this litter with varying amounts of oh so squishy wrinkles so they are likely mixes of many breeds. It's possible there could be some Lab in them but we don't know for sure. Their mama, Winn-Dixie, is a gorgeous and super sweet girl who weighs about 45 lbs. We don't know who dad is but we are guessing these pups will be large like their mom when all grown up. Lassie is looking for a family that understands the time, patience, and energy needed to raise a young pup. We require all puppy adopters to provide training that includes: house training, basic training, leash training, and socialization. Additionally, this cutie is going to need proper exercise, mental stimulation, and your attention and love to grow up to be the best companion. We do not allow our dogs or puppies to sleep or live outside; they must be incorporated into your family and be made a priority in your life. In return, you will have the most loving and loyal family member you could ask for. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting a puppy, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs.

            "description": "Looking for some fun and adventure in 2021? Winn-Dixie's Pups would be happy to be by your side every step of the way. These precious Pit Bull Terrier mixes are almost 2 months old and they can't wait to meet their forever families. There are a bunch of different colored pups in this litter with varying amounts of oh so squishy wrinkles so they are likely mixes of many breeds. It's possible there could be some Lab in them but we don't know for sure. Their mama, Winn-Dixie, is a gorgeous and super sweet girl who weighs about 45 lbs. We don't know who dad is but we are guessing these pups will be large like their mom when all grown up. Buck is looking for a family that understands the time, patience, and energy needed to raise a young pup. We require all puppy adopters to provide training that includes: house training, basic training, leash training, and socialization. Additionally, this cutie is going to need proper exercise, mental stimulation, and your attention and love to grow up to be the best companion. We do not allow our dogs or puppies to sleep or live outside; they must be incorporated into your family and be made a priority in your life. In return, you will have the most loving and loyal family member you could ask for. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting a puppy, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs. Thank you for rescuing.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue.

            "description": "Looking for some fun and adventure in 2021? Winn-Dixie's Pups would be happy to be by your side every step of the way. These precious Pit Bull Terrier mixes are almost 2 months old and they can't wait to meet their forever families. There are a bunch of different colored pups in this litter with varying amounts of oh so squishy wrinkles so they are likely mixes of many breeds. It's possible there could be some Lab in them but we don't know for sure. Their mama, Winn-Dixie, is a gorgeous and super sweet girl who weighs about 45 lbs. We don't know who dad is but we are guessing these pups will be large like their mom when all grown up. Clifford is looking for a family that understands the time, patience, and energy needed to raise a young pup. We require all puppy adopters to provide training that includes: house training, basic training, leash training, and socialization. Additionally, this cutie is going to need proper exercise, mental stimulation, and your attention and love to grow up to be the best companion. We do not allow our dogs or puppies to sleep or live outside; they must be incorporated into your family and be made a priority in your life. In return, you will have the most loving and loyal family member you could ask for. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting a puppy, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs. Thank you for rescuing.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue.

            "description": "If you are interested in adopting this dog, please download and complete an Adoption Questionnaire from our website and email Dena at DenaE@k-9lifesavers.org\nYou can learn about the adoption process and find a Word, PDF and ONLINE version of the questionnaire by visiting: http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/howtoadopt/.\nDog's Name: Baby Bobby\nEstimated Breed: Chihuahua Terrier MIX\nApproximate Age: born 10/23/2020\nApproximate Weight: 5 LBS\nCurrently Living at: foster\nAdoption Fee: $375\nDOG'S DESCRIPTION:\nBobby, one of the Brady Bunch litter, born 10/23 is the climber of the bunch and he is ready for his loving FOREVER home. A puppy is a huge commitment, please be sure you understand and are ready for supporting the puppy needs in time, training, attention, and love. Mom is a Chihuahua (the last pic in the group), daddy is unknown but probably another terrier of some sort. Submit an application, when puppies have adopters they will be removed from the website.\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, rabies (if puppy is old enough), distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing (if puppy is old enough), monthly heartworm prevention while in our care, monthly flea/tick prevention while in our care, and our transport costs. As part of the adoption agreement, adopters agree to get the pup spayed/neutered and provide K-9 Lifesavers with proof of spay/neuter. K-9 Lifesavers does not cover the cost of spay/neuter for puppies 6 months or younger.\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home. For more information on becoming a foster parent, and our Foster Program, visit http://www.k-9lifesavers.org/foster/ or email our Foster Coordinator at foster@k-9lifesavers.org\nHelp Save Lives! Make a tax-deductible donation today and help save a life. Donations help us offset boarding costs and additional medical treatment for those dogs who need it. K-9 Lifesavers receives NO federal funding and survive with your generous support! We are all volunteer based organization so every cent from your donation goes directly to the dogs in our care.\nFor more information on K-9 Lifesavers, or to view a complete listing of all our Adoptable Dogs, visit our website at www.k-9lifesavers.org.\nCheck out our social media!

To arrange a meet and greet with a dog, you MUST fill out the adoption application so that it can be sent to the foster parent for review to determine if your home is a match for the dog. If a dog receives multiple applications, we operate on a best-fit basis, not first come first served.***\n\nHi! My name is Huck! I have so much love to give. You can tell 'cause I have a heart on my head! My foster family says I'm kinda weird and goofy. I am easily spooked, and a bit timid. I have been more and more open every day since I got to my foster family's house. I love living with my foster family. They feed me lots of food and snacks (I'm a big fan of treats and meals), and they have other dogs around, too! I love having dog friends around to play with, and people around to scratch my HUGE ears. \n\nWhen I'm inside, I am very calm, reserved, and respectful. I mostly lay on my favorite dog bed. In the back yard, I am much more excitable and I love to run around and bark. Don't worry, my bark is actually very cute and endearing. It sounds like a very muted \"\"whoo!\"\". I am pretty submissive, and I get along with everybody. My perfect forever home would have some space for me to run around, preferably a fenced-in yard. I would also really love to have another dog around to play with, but I would also be okay with frequent dog park visits. I'm not the type of dog to shower you in affection at first, but in a few short weeks, I will be trying to climb into your lap. \n\nI am neutered, up-to-date on vaccinations, microchipped, have been dewormed, and am current on my monthly flea/tick and heartworm preventatives. My adoption fee is $300. If you think I could be the one for you, please fill out an adoption application on our website: www.secondchancenc.org. Thank you!",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Honeydew, or Honey for short! I am an 11 year old retriever mix. I am about 60 pounds, but that is a few more pounds than I should be, so my foster family has been helping me try and lose a little weight.\n\nI am currently going through heartworm treatment, so my activity has to be restricted until that is finished. When I wasn't on activity restrictions, I liked walking around the block with my foster family. Since I'm an older girl and a little overweight, my hips bother me just a bit so our walks are just a casual stroll. I have made great improvements since I got here though - when I first got to my foster family's house I wasn't able to make it around the block and I couldn't walk up the stairs of the front porch. Now I can do both!\n\nMy foster home has three other dogs, and I get along with them well, but I'm not super playful, I just like to take it easy and sit with my foster mom and dad.\n\nAn ideal home for me would be the following:\n\n Someone who is either an early bird or goes back to sleep easily (if needed)! My current schedule is going to bed around 9 or 10 and waking up between 4 and 5.\n\n If I'm allowed on the couch and/or in the bed, someone who is able to lift me, at least part of the way. I can get my front legs up on the couch, but I haven't quite mastered the back legs yet.\n\n A one-story home. I can walk up a couple of stairs if it is a front porch or something, but I can't really do more than that, and I have a little trouble going down the stairs as well.\n\n Someone who is looking for a dog that is more like a cat. I am kind of a funny girl and I don't really care too much about getting pet or playing. Mostly I just like to be near my foster mom or dad, sometimes snuggled up next to them, but sometimes just being in the same room is sufficient!\n\n Someone who will help me shed these last few pounds. Once I can start taking walks again I think that will really help.\n\nA few other miscellaneous things about me:\n\n I am on a couple of medications for arthritis and joint pain that will need to continue.\n\n I am housetrained!\n\n My foster mom says I am the funniest dog she knows. I don't know what she means by\nthat, she just thinks I do funny things I guess!\n\n I LOVE treats. I know, all dogs love treats, but I really love them. Because of my weight\nI get them pretty sparingly, but I get about 10 years younger when it's treat time.\n\nIf it sounds like I might be a good fit and you are interested in adopting me, please fill out an application on our website: www.secondchancenc.org. I am so excited to meet you!",

Apartments may be ok!\nFence Requirements: Preferred\nSpecial Info:\n\nThe information we are providing for this animal was developed based on observations and assessments in a shelter or foster environment. We do our best to provide information that will help determine if the dog might be a good fit for you. Please note that behaviors may change in a home environment. We also ask our applicants to assume that any animal they adopt from us will need to be potty trained and learn house manners, although this is not always the case. Our online animal bios are designed to provide as much information as possible and answer some anticipated questions. We do not have the resources to respond to emails with more specific questions.\n\nWe are receiving an unusually high number of applications per pet at this time! Please follow the rules below to ensure your application is reviewed; pay attention closely to these instructions because applications will NOT be processed if they are not followed. Please keep in mind that dog/cat availability is currently changing by the hour; you will receive an email if the animal you are interested in is no longer available. New dogs become available almost every day, so feel free to let us know if someone else interests you if your initial choice is already adopted! \n\nFill out the application (DOG: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IHD-DOG-Application-9-10-18.pdf, CAT: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IHD-CAT-Application.pdf) completely. Every question must be answered, and it must be signed. If you are going to type your responses, open the application, save it, type your answers, and save it again. \n\n-Applicants must be 21+ years old and live within a 50-mile radius of our shelter at 22415 Groesbeck Hwy, Warren 48089.\n\n-You must identify at least 1 dog/cat that you are interested in. If there are multiple dogs/cats, number them in order of priority. \n\n-Scan a copy of proof of home ownership (i.e. tax bill, deed, or mortgage payment - you can black out the account #, etc.) or animal clause/agreement of your rental agreement.\n\n-Attach the application and home ownership proof/rental agreement animal clause to a new email and send it to bark@iheartdogs.org. The subject line must be formatted to read \"\"#1 choice of dog/cat, Your First and Last Name\"\". Example: Subject: Fido, Jane Doe\nOnce your application is received, it will be assigned to an Adoption Counselor who will follow-up with the applicant who is the best fit within a few days, or to discuss other dogs/cats. It could take up to a couple of weeks for you to receive a final disposition on your application so there is no need to check on the status.\n\n-Introductions will be scheduled by appointment only, 45 minutes per appointment. The entire household, including current dogs, must be present for the appointment. The introductions will take place outside in our parking lot.\n\n-We will continue to perform vet checks for current and prior pets in the household.\n\n-Home visits will be in person for the yard and virtual for inside the home.\n\n-Finalizing the adoption will also be scheduled by appointment.\n\nWhile this process may seem cumbersome, it is interim during COVID-19, and it is designed to help us respond to the volume of emails we receive every day. Since we are receiving a high volume of applications, please be patient if a dog/cat is no longer available. \n\nThank you for your understanding.",

He can be a very bossy and pushy boy. He needs an owner who understands his breed and is willing to work out the kinks. Positives- he loves attention and praise. He enjoys \"\"working\"\" and will need a job or someone who will be able to engage his busy mind. He is not a backyard, laze around dog. He must have boundaries. Negatives- does not like having his toys taken away during play and has snapped/growled during play time. He is however easily redirected and learns very quickly what it is you want from him. He has an extremely high prey drive that will need to be channeled towards productive work/play. For that reason we are requesting no one with small children at this time. Breed savvy home a must. Fill out an application at www.res-que.org under adoption info.Our dogs are spayed/neutered and utd on shots before adoption unless medically not advised by our Vet.",

I've had a pretty traumatic couple weeks...my owner and best buddy passed away and I ended up here. I know the people here mean well, but I just shake and bark from my kennel. I know I'll warm up and come out of my shell once I feel safe, and then my true personality will shine through. The humans here have found that I reeeaaally love squeaky toys, even more so than snacks! I'm looking for a quiet, patient home that will take the time to get to know me and let me feel safe and loved. I am around a year old, neutered, vaccinated and heartworm negative.",

I figure out things pretty quickly and Im doing well with using the puppy pads for potty training. Im alert, love to play with the kids in my foster family and enjoy cuddles, and long naps. I would be best with an active family or person, but I do settle down easy in the house after a little play time. Im in search of a loving home and in return, I will be your faithful, loving friend for years to come.",

She was the last of her 3 siblings to be captured and alluded is for months. Finally on February 22 2019 we were able to drug her and trap her in a kennel. Buster is still a work in progress but her current foster home has so many dogs with behavioral issues that Buster and her brother Sammie are spending significant time in their crates and we really just want more for them. \n\nBuster is still a bit leery and very pensive in some moments however she's come SO far since we caught her. Today, with the help of her Thunder Shirt (which she hasn't needed in over a year), lots of love and some patience she will sometimes seek out attention! Buster is bonded (healthy bond) with her more outgoing brother Sammie and really follows his lead. We would love them to find a foster or FURever home of their own, hopefully with less dogs than their current foster. The home needs to be ok being patient and showing them the love they need to continue to progress towards their potential awesomeness! Buster and Sammie are good with other dogs and cats, however Buster does better with other more submissive and or independent canine housemates.\n\nThis pair is truly beyond deserving and so amazing. After losing their human, being left to basically fend for themselves, being trapped, being mostly rehabbed and now living in a foster with so many other dogs. This dynamic duo deserves a fantastic home to live out the rest of their time on this planet. \n \n\nDue to having them so long in rescue and truly wanting to find them the most amazing home we have lowered their fee, as long as they are adopted together.\n\n $200.00 Adoption Fee \n\n(Which is considered a non refundable donation and being we are a 501c3 organization it is tax deductible. The fee itself is not negotiable, our vets don't negotiate and thus neither do we.)\n\nIf you think Buster and Sammie may be a good fit for your household and you're interested in helping please contact us!!! \n\nTo Contact Us\n\nMessage us through our website http://www.highplainspaw.org\n\nMessage the Facebook Page at https://www.facebook.com/HighPlainsPAW\n\nFill out our Adoption Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/adoption-application\n\nFill out our Foster Application at https://www.highplainspaw.org/foster-application\n\nEmail us at highplainspaw@gmail.com\n\nCall our VOICEMAIL at (402)957-1578\n\nWE DO NOT HAVE A FACILITY ALL OUR DOGS ARE LOCATED IN FOSTER HOMES. This means there is no place for you to go in person to view our dogs. We ask that an application be filled out and we will go from there!",

            "description": "Some doggos are worth melting for....\n\nHey fellas! So ice to meet you! I am Olaf, a 12 year old, male Poodle-Shih Tzu, and all of 13 lbs! I was found wandering the streets of Mexico before TAP rescued me. I have a beautiful before and after glam story and you can check it on TAP's IG! Matty looking streetos actually hide the most beautiful dogs inside, and I am proof of that! I am an older gentleman and the streets have given me one blind eye. It doesnt come in my way, unless I cant see ya in my rearview mirror and come underfoot. No lasting harm done, I pawmise! I am good on the leash and almost all bathroom trained. I will be neutered soon!\n\nI am a spunky pup who will warm even the coldest of hearts. I am pretty easy-going and love attention when showered on me. I am getting the hang of a warm, cozy home after a fun stroll through the park and then cuddling with my people. This boy has been winning compliments about town and you cant ignore my cute face or snaggle teeth either! No one has caught on to my one-eyed-ness, and it sure doesnt limit me from hopping on your lap to cuddle. I have had trouble with some mild separation anxiety because of the stay-home situation my foster fam is in, but with conditioning, I am sure we can work on it. I am already pretty good in the crate! I am also a very friendly fella who adores people! I havent met kiddos yet. I am friendly towards dogs, specially the ones that look like me. I do very well at parks and dog beach too. I havent met kitties too, but I don't think I should have an issue. I dont even chase squirrels!\n\nIf you have any doubts regarding me, I'd say 'Let it gooooo\"! I can pawmise to bring a happy ray of sunshine in your life. We all deserve some love and affection and I cant wait to share my life with my furever family! I would be happier with someone who stays home a lot and down for cuddling. My adoption fee is $150 and that includes spaying/neutering, shots, and microchip. If you want to take me home, please fill out the form on the website here https://theanimalpad.org/adoption-application/",

            "description": "This precious puppy is Lucy (DOB Jan 2020), a pure bred Feist puppy looking for a home. Lucy was surrendered to us by her breeder when she as 4 weeks old. Unfortunatley her mother decided motherhood was not for her and attacked her litter. Lucy was the most wounded of the litter and the breeder could not afford her vet care. One of Lucy's eyes had to be removed and the other one is impaired. She can see some but it is limited sight. She also lost a bit of her tongue and has a bit of ear missing. That is the bad news. The good news is that Lucy has a zest for life like no other dog we have seen in a long time. She is super friendly and outgoing and her spirit has not been at all affected by what has happened to her. She runs and plays like a normal puppy. Lucy is active and will need a home that can meet her energy requirements. She will eventually wear herself out and become a sleepy cuddle bug but she does love to play. She is good with other dogs, is fine with cats and would be great for a home with kids that are looking for a dog that wouldn't mind some rough play. Lucy is up to date with shots, spayed, negative for heartworms/on prevention and is learning housebreaking, we are not quite there yet but she will hold it while being crated. If you think you are a fit for Lucy, please visit our website at www.myhstc.org to submit an adoption application.\n\nAdoption fee is $85 which includes all vet work\n\nWe prescreen all applicants prior to a meeting. To be screened, please submit an adoption application at www.myhstc.org",

But below that handsome exterior is something very special. The sweetest soul you can imagine! \n\nWhen Maverick warms up to you he will be your best bud. Whether on a walk, watching Television together, playing with squeaky toys or just chillin', this baby will be a devoted companion. \n\nDid we mention cuddling? Yep, he's the best. And Maverick is a \"Ball Sleeper.\" That's when a dog wraps himself in the tiniest, tightest ball you can imagine, reminding folks he won't take up much room on the couch or in the bed. \n\nMaverick has been very loved and cared for. And that's what his owners are praying for. Someone special just like Maverick! Maverick has not been cat tested but we think would do well with another sweet dog (depending on Meet and Greets) and older children. \n\nIn addition to being extremely intelligent, a quick learner and highly devoted, Maverick also has a good sense of humor. Somehow he makes a Birthday Hat and other outfits look quite G-Q-ish. If YOU can see what we see in those shiny golden brown eyes let us know and we'll D.M. Maverick and let him know! \n",

We will also do random, periodic vet checks to ensure all dogs adopted from us continue to have the best care.  We will check for any follow up visits needed and that they are on a monthly Heartworm Prevention.\n\nIf you rent or own a home, we prefer you to have a fenced in yard. \n\nApartment living is also ok but prefer a fenced in area if close to the road.\nAll adults in the home will need to know they are getting a dog and will need to sign the adoption agreement.\nWe do not adopt to college students with multiple roommates. \nMilitary will need to provide a backup plan.\nWe require all pets in the home to be spay and/or neutered. Because too many dogs are being killed, due to there not being enough homes per dog in need. Only the lucky ones end up here.",

I would LOVE a playmate!\nGood with Cats? No cats please!\nGood with Kids? Older kids only, if you please!\nGood with Strangers? I love everyone!\nPotty Trained? Working on it!\nCrate Trained? I'll need some patient training to be crate trained, but I would love a family that's ok without crating me!\n\nInterested? Learn more about Junie below!\n\nAbout Junie:\n\nMy name is\n\nJunie\n\nand I'm almost 1 year old. I came from South Dakota in November to join my foster family. At first I was really nervous being in the big city. I had a hard time being on a leash and walking through doorways. I was really used to chasing whatever I wanted, so I made my family's cats a bit crazy. I'm still working on my impulse control. I do get it right sometime. I'm totally potty trained as long as you take me out every couple of hours.\n\nI\n\nlove being outside playing and chasing squirrels. I especially like long walks in the woods. I'm learning to walk well on a leash, but you need to find the right one so I don't slip out to visit all my neighborhood friends and run around. I am especially snuggly, and sometimes think I'm a lap dog- even though I'm about 50 lbs. I really like to play tug of war and catch a ball (in the house, I'm still a bit nervous doing that outside). I really need to chew and will rip apart any stuffy to reveal it's fluffy insides.\n\nI really love to be with my people and I follow my foster mom everywhere she goes. I'm terrified of a kennel so I sleep on my pillow next to my foster parents---though sometimes I wake up in their bed in the morning.\n\nI'm a really smart dog and learn fast. I just need lots more training and treats and of course lots of love and attention!\n\nI'm looking for my forever family, of course! I need to be *foster to adopt* first if you are looking to adopt me, because I still need a few vet appointments. :)\n\nBut, if you aren't quite ready to make the full leap to adoption, I would love to settle in with you as my foster!\nTwin Cities Pet Rescue provides its foster families with food, supplies, and veterinary care for its animals. All you need to do is supply the love!\n\nAdoption Fee: $475\n\nMEET ME/ADOPT ME: If you'd like to arrange a meeting or begin the adoption process, please fill out an adoption application by visiting www.twincitiespetrescue.org/adopt/adopt-a-dog/ . A volunteer from Twin Cities Pet Rescue will contact you once your application is reviewed.\n\nFOSTER HOMES NEEDED!!! Twin Cities Pet Rescue is a volunteer-run, foster home-based organization. We can only rescue as many animals as available foster homes. Please consider saving the life of an animal in need and become a volunteer foster home today. To become a foster, fill out a dog or cat foster application on the Twin Cities Pet Rescue website: www.twincitiespetrescue.org . There is little to no cost to foster an animal.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Twin Cities Pet Rescue does not adopt to homes further than 60 miles from the Minneapolis/St. Paul Metro Area.",

Most of our dogs are from local LA area shelters, we generally have no prior history for them.\nAdoption fees vary between $400 - $500 for puppies 8 weeks - 5 years, $350 6 - 9 years and $300 for dogs over 9 years. Adoption fee covers spay/neuter, vaccinations, microchip, wellness check and of course all the love and daily care we take with each dog before they are adopted.\nWe believe a well behaved dog is a happy dog and companion. Therefore, we require at least one session with one of our recommended behaviorists for a reduced fee which is not included in the adoption fee.\nWe are a busy fully functioning rescue and facility, unfortunately, we do not take requests for more photos and/or video.

More of her personality is coming out each day, she is very easy going and sometimes a little shy, but gets exited when her foster family comes home and she greets them at the door with her tail wagging. She gets along well with other dogs and people. She learned to use the dog door and has not had an accident at all. At night, she sleeps on a dog bed in the bedroom with her foster family member. So far, we have not crated her, but she sometimes likes to sleep in an open crate during the day. She is starting to get dog bones out of the toy basket to chew on. We don't have any young children here, so we are not sure how she is with young children. As she gets a little more comfortable, we will work on some commands like sit and leash training. \n\nIf you are looking for a large sweet girl, Mercedes could the dog for you.\n\nMercedes is a Female Plott Hound Mix that we estimate to be 2 years old and weighs 57 lbs.",

            "description": "NO LONGER ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS!!\n\nMeet Teddy. Teddy and his brother, Franklin, are the result of two family dogs living together who were not spayed or neutered. Their owners are older and not attentive to their dogs, who mostly live outside. They didn't even realize their female dog was pregnant, and she would have been on her own if Good Samaritans were not looking out for her. Teddy's mom dug out a bunker-type area inside an old, dilapidated shed on the property to protect and nurse her pups. She was smart to find a quiet place with cover and no traffic.\n\nThankfully, a Good Samaritan was watching out for her and discovered the puppies. They started feeding her and making sure she had fresh water and blankets to nurse the puppies. They kept the puppies with mom until they were six weeks old and then worked to get all the dogs released to rescue. The owners surrendered the puppies but wanted to keep their parents. They agreed to get them spayed and neutered, so there will be no more puppies, and we will continue to reach out and monitor their level of care.\n\nTeddy is about eight weeks old and weighs 9-10 lbs. He and his brother Franklin now live together in a foster home. We think his mom is some mix of Chesapeake Bay Retriever or German Shorthaired Lab mix, and dad may be a Pointer mix with his gorgeous snow-white coat. It's so rare for us to know who both parents are, and these dogs are clearly fluffier than your typical Lab. We expect Teddy to be a large dog, about 50-65lbs when fully grown. He has already transitioned to puppy kibble and is being crate trained. During the day, both pups have a large penned area to romp and play in with access to their crate. Their foster parents have started closing the crate for short periods to get them accustomed to containment and begin the work on potty training.\n\nThis gorgeous fluffy boy needs a fun, active family ready for puppy mode and committed to training. He is very cute now but will grow to be a large, energetic dog who needs a capable handler. He really enjoys playtime with his brother, so a family with another social, playful pup in the home would be ideal for Teddy to learn from.\n\nPreference will be given to families with:\n\nLarge dog experience\n\nFlexible, puppy-friendly schedule\n\nAnother social dog in the home\n\nActive family\n\nWill only be adopted to families in the DC metro and surrounding area\n\nTeddy is still too young to be neutered, but having him neutered at the appropriate age will be required as part of his adoption terms. We will require that proof of neuter is provided to the rescue.\n\nTeddy will be coming to N. VA on 2/6/21 and we'd like him to go straight home.\n\nApply today!\n\nBREED ESTIMATE: Retriever/Pointer mix\nGENDER: Male\nAPPROXIMATE WEIGHT: 9 lbs (will be a larger dog 55lb - 70lbs fully grown)\nAPPROXIMATE AGE: ~ 7.5 weeks\nCOAT TYPE: Medium - fluffy\nADOPTION FEE: $400\nOTHER INFO: utd on shots/microchipped\nLOCATION: Rock Hill, SC - Coming to N. VA on 2/6/21\n\nFOR MORE INFO OR TO ADOPT: Please go to https://adopt.worthydog.org and complete the application.\n\nYou can also help save dogs like this one by becoming a foster, providing a rescue dog with a temporary home and giving them the love and care they need until they are permanently adopted. Every person who fosters is directly responsible for saving the life of a dog, because we can only save as many dogs as we have foster families available to welcome them into their homes. If you think you might be interested in becoming a foster and want to learn more, please go to https://foster.worthydog.org and fill out an application.\n\nWorthy Dog Rescue is an all-volunteer, foster-based rescue that primarily adopts to families in the DC Metro area.",

Im not sure I have ever met a dog who loves tennis balls more! He loves fetching them, playing with them and popping them. He does great on long walks or runs and needs an owner who will give him the exercise and activity a young, muscly, energetic pup deserves. After some activity, he would love nothing more than to snuggle up with you on the couch or just hangout and be your lover boy. Chesney would do best in a home with a confident older dog oras an only pet. He is crate trained and potty trained and is a smart boy. We arent sure why he hasnt found a home of his own yet, he has been with the rescue way longer than is merited. If you can be that home for him, he will reward you forever with love and kisses.\n ...",

I was found on the streets of KCK with about 2 weeks left in my pregnancy. Boy was I thankful to be taken in before it started getting cold. I gave birth to 8 healthy puppies and raised them until they were fully weaned. My puppies have all been adopted!\nBeing a mom was fine, but I'm ready to be someone's baby.\nEveryone says I am super smart. I know how to sit on command. I hope my forever family keeps teaching me how to do tricks because I love learning treats! I also hope my forever family likes to go on walks or runs, play trips and go to the park. I'm an active girl!\nI lived in foster with a cat and with a proper introduction I can live with another one. I am pretty playful though, if your cat wouldn't want to play they might not like me. I love hanging out with other playful dogs!\n ...",

Ben would love to make himself at home on your couch, your bed, or under your desk while you work from home.\nBen would be most successful in a home with another large, calm and confident dog. He loves kiddos and humans of all kinds but would be best in a home with no small dogs or cats without a long, slow and proper introduction. Because he is so loyal to his people he tends to be protective in a home so would benefit greatly from ongoing training. He is so incredibly smart it makes him happier and more content to learn good behaviors and be rewarded.\nBenjamin cannot wait to go home with his forever family. Adopt Benjamin Button!\n ...",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Casey. I\u2019m a 1yr old German Shepherd Mix whose one true purpose in life is to cuddle with you forever and ever. I weigh a little over 40lbs and am the queen of giving you: \u201cpuppy dog eyes\u201d. \n\nMy origin story may not have the best of beginnings, but as my foster mom knows, I have tried my best to make the most out of still being the easy-going, happy go-lucky girl that I am.  As your pup, I will always be by your side (literally and figuratively!). I know I\u2019m slightly bigger than most \u201clap dogs\u201d but that will not stop me from cuddling up next to you or getting on your lap to give and receive all the love. Once I get to know you after a few snuggle sessions, it means that I will do everything in my power to defend you and our home. This just means that if I hear something that doesn\u2019t sound right or sense danger, I will make my presence known, otherwise, I\u2019m a relatively quiet dog. I don\u2019t bark unless I absolutely have to because I believe that resting my vocal chords is very important. \n\nI do have a small aversion to loud noises because they make me a bit jumpy and I do tend to hesitate just a bit when meeting new people, but once I get to know you and you show me love (aka give me a treat or some belly rubs), that all goes away! \n\nI am completely potty-trained, do very well in my kennel, and I know commands like \u201csit\u201d and \u201ccome\u201d. I am very receptive to hearing my name and the commands that I know when called. I am currently working on learning commands like \u201cstay\u201d and tricks like \u201cspin\u201d but, honestly, why learn it when I know my foster mom is going to end up still giving me the treats anyway? I don\u2019t mind cats or other dogs at all and love hanging out with humans of all sizes. \n\nI am up to date on all my vaccinations, am heartworm negative, and am going to go and get spayed in early February of this year! I am an amazing girl and would love to join and be with you in my forever home!\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq\n\n*Any breed labels used by Take Paws Rescue, its employees/volunteers, or on vet records provided cannot be guaranteed.  Breed labels are given based on information obtained during intake and/or best guesses based on appearance and/or temperament of the dogs and Take Paws Rescue gives no assurance to the accuracy of these labels. Labels are necessary for postings to many animal networking sites, such as Pet Finder, and are no way a guarantee. Additionally, exact age and potential size cannot be guaranteed.",

            "description": "Hello, adopters. \nThis is Petra here. Tonight I heard volunteers talk about updating pictures and trying to capture personalities. So, apparently, I don't smile enough. So, I improved my game tonight. I wasn't very fond of the fluffy scarf they threw on me, but sitting with volunteer Kris was pretty amazing and brought me so much happiness. She was doing paperwork and sipping her drink. I just kept giving a nudge as a reminder that I would really like some love. I was in heaven. Yeah, I can visual myself making that smooth transition right into a home. \n\nIf you follow The A.R.K. page, you already know my BFF Pugsly. She puts a smile on my face and reminds me to have fun in life. She also loves people.. In fact, she had a hard time peeling herself away for a Kodak moment, but she ended up succeeding. I encouraged her to put on a cheesy smile too. I hope our plan works. We are so ready for a home. \n\nWe are inseparable, so we leaving a shelter together. So, if you are a family willing to invest time in two lovely, six-year-old girls AND have a fenced in yard, then please send in an application. Even if you share this post, you may just help us find the perfect home. \n\nOh, yeah, Kris just reminded me to share with The Ark followers that we keep a clean kennel (apparently that is important to people). She also wanted me to tell you that she had a cookie on the edge of the desk, and I was respectful of space while I was sitting by her. I didn't try to snatch it.\n\nSo, I guess that is all for tonight. If I missed anything, just contact The ARK. They will answer any questions that you may have. The volunteers and staff have become family. It will be hard to say our goodbyes when we are adopted, but we know our future adopters have a good chance of sending an update for the volunteers, at least at Christmas time. I see lots of my old pals on cards in the lobby. \n\nI have rambled long enough. See you soon!\n\nPetra & Pugsly\n\nAdoption Application: https://thearkanimalshelter.org/adoption-application/\nDownload and complete the application. \n\nEmail to arkanimalshelter@yahoo.com. Once your application is approved, you will be contacted for a meet and greet.\n\nMEET and GREET is by appointment only.\nQuestions? 309-246-4275\n",

            "description": "Boomer is a sweet, more calm lab. He loves butt scratches! He loves them so much that he does a little dance when he gets them. It's soo cute! His fur is baby soft and he has the cool unique stripe down his back. Boomer came to us as a stray but seems to be looking for his family. He is about 3 years old and heartworm positive. He will need to go through heartworm treatment either with a foster or in a foster to adopt home.\n<br>Please call the shelter at (706) 795-2868 to schedule a meet and greet.\n\nMadison Oglethorpe Animal Shelter is a non-profit shelter serving over 720 square miles. We are open intake, meaning we can not turn away animals from either county we serve. Our shelter intakes double or triple it's capacity every month so it is essential we place animals quickly into adoptive homes. Since so many animals enter the shelter we often don't have enough volunteers to write an individual bio for each. Please feel free to call the shelter Wednesday-Sunday to inquire about the animal you are interested in. 706-795-2868.\n\nViewing and adoption hours at our shelter are Wednesday through Sunday from 12 PM to 5 PM. \nAll adoption fees include age-appropriate vaccinations, flea treatment, deworming, and spay or neuter, microchip, and adoption packet. \nFees:\nDogs over 4 months old: $100\nPuppies under 4 months: $125. \nCats and Kittens are $75 ($65 without microchip). \n\nFor your convenience you can fill out an adoption application for any of our current residents at www.moaspets.com. Join us on Facebook at\nhttps://www.facebook.com/moaspets. It's a great way to stay up to the minute on the furry 4 legged friends we have looking for a loving forever home. \nWe are located at:\n1888 Colbert Danielsville Rd \nDanielsville, GA 30633 \n706-795-2868\n\nNOTE: Our adoptions are first come first served, simply filling out an application does not mean the animal will be held for you, you must come meet the animal in person in order to be considered for adoption.\nIf you rent you must bring your lease or a letter from your landlord stating you may adopt.",

I like to play with my foster parents and am learning how to play with toys. I sleep through the night on most nights. I am not the biggest fan of my crate but will sleep in there during the nighttime. I am almost completely potty trained and as long as you take me out every few hours I won't have any accidents. I am very curious of other people and dogs when I go outside and love to sniff around in the grass. I typically have a lot of energy but my foster parents take me on nice long walks to tire me out.\n\nI hope I can meet my new family soon!\n\nCrew is a male Collie/Spaniel Mix born around 7/10/2018 and currently weighs 36lbs.",

After a visit to vet, it was determined that he had either been hit by a car or thrown from a car. He had a fractured back leg, but it is aligned and healing well. He has a bit of a limp right now, but is expected to make a complete recovery. Boomer's injury hasn't slowed him down a bit though! You won't find a happier friendlier boy\n\nBoomer is a wonderful dog. He is house trained, can sit and use doggy door. He is not happy being crated, but at his foster home does well without being crated. He wants to be a lap dog and loves to receive and give affection.\n\nBoomer would do well with an active family who is home or with another active dog. He loves to take walks, but since he is still recuperating, has not been able to exercise as much as normal. He would do great with children and loves car rides. Boomer is a great, loving dog who will make a great addition to a family. If you'd like to meet Boomer, please fill out a no-obligation application at www.tmhpr.com/adopt. Boomer's estimated birthdate is 6/16/19.\nPlease visit our website at tmhpr.com for more information.

He keeps a clean kennel at the shelter and walks really well on a leash. He responds very well to basic commands and is highly trainable. He enjoys the company of submissive dogs that aren`t rough and tumble players and he is a vocal doggo that like likes to play chase or would do excellent as the only dog in the home. He would not do well with small dogs or cats. Roger would do well with children of all ages, but would need to be monitored around children under 10 due to his size and strength. Roger would do best in an active home with a fenced yard to chase tennis balls in or on a big piece of land. He would also make an excellent hiking buddy and/or camping buddy. Roger is loves attention and would love nothing more than to be a snuggle doggo at the end of a long day. Color:Black, Markings:white on chest",

            "description": "Meet Pancake!  So handsome!   We are really enjoying this fur baby!!! Pancake ended up at a shelter and came in as a stray.  He is a young guy at probably about a year old or maybe a little yes and weighs about 38 pounds so not a huge dog. Pancake (Name given at the shelter) is an energetic boy that would love an energetic outlet.  He needs an avenue to burn some energy like going to a dog park a few times a week.  But...he really is quite calm in a home setting which is surprising with his young age. Also, he is smart and learns routines quickly. He learned sit very quickly and picks up routines quickly.  One of Pancakes' best qualities is that he loves other animals so he would be a good dog park dog for sure. He is a little shy with humans so we are working on that with him and he is making a lot of progress. After a 24 hour period he is your best friend.   Even though he is great with other animals, we think he would be best suited for a home without other animals so that he will bond with his humans as he tends to bond with other dogs.  He is not aggressive at all with other animals but he does get super HAPPY around them and his energy level goes way up.  We think Pancake is going to make a great dog for someone with some love and patience. He just needs some basic manners and structure in his life which a person with a rescue heart can provide!  If you would like an adoption application, email storkwoods@comcast.net.  This is how we begin each potential adoption. We are an all volunteer based rescue trying to save as many as we can!",

We are not sure of her breed(s) possibly spaniel or retriever and that mysterious rescue gene. She has sparkly eyes, constant curiosity and is full of that puppy playful spirit. She loves to play fetch and tug of war. Tres loves water and anything that moves captures her attention.  She lies on her back to rest and holds her toys between her paws like a cat.  She is smart and learns quickly.  She sleeps quietly in her kennel at night. She knows sit, down, off (very hard for her to remember that so far), leave it (we are working on that one) and has just started her leash training.  Her food preferences so far are \u201canything\u201d.\n Tres would love a dog buddy to play with, a secure attached fence yard, and a human with some time at home during the day to further her training and socializing.  Please contact 4lvdch@bullerinetworks.net to fill out a pre-adopt form so that you can meet this cutie.",

I love flying across the yard and lauding my flying skills and locking in on my target. I\u2019m excited for takeoff but will \u201cSit and wait\u201d. Once my guidance radar locks in I\u2019ll retrieve my target and return it with a perfect landing, awaiting take off again. \n\nI excel at learning, practicing my agility, being a part of a squadron that\u2019ll support my desire for being the best I can be. I can chill with the best of them inside & yet excel outside. With a bit of time & training i could be a competitive dog athlete - everything from agility, to flyball, even frisbee competitions could be possibilities.\n\nAs I stated earlier I love to chill with my squadron. I love to be told I\u2019m the best, inverted for petting, spoiled with treats and knowing \u201cYou\u2019ve got that lovin\u2019 feeling\u201d for me.\n\nNow for my personal info. I\u2019m a 3 yr old, 55 lb. Lab/Pointer and who knows what else is in the mix!  I\u2019m not sure of my DNA but I know I\u2019m HANDSOME! \n\nI\u2019m house-trained, and when it\u2019s time to go out I do well on a leash. No chewing except on my bones and toys. I don\u2019t get on the furniture unless asked to and I also mind my manners. I don\u2019t use a crate and I sleep on my doggie bed at night. I\u2019m good with people of all ages, good with dogs but cats unknown.\n\nCould you be my new squadron? Are you willing to help me be the best I can be, as I love you unconditionally?\n\nOur standard adoption fee is $375 cash or check and $385 credit card ($10 processing fee). .  It includes spay/neuter when age appropriate at our participating vets, age appropriate core vaccinations, fecal testing, deworming, flea and tick preventative,1st vet visit at one of our participating vets, and micro-chipping. \n\n\nWe must have an application, conduct a phone interview, and meet your entire family to approve an adoption. Please email adopt@safehavendogsIL.org for an application or additional details.\n\nPlease note that the breeds and sizes posted in this biography are educated best guesses and are not guaranteed.\n\nPlease consider becoming a foster home while you search for your new best friend. We need foster homes - pounds are overflowing with puppies and adult dogs that are at-risk and need help. We can only rescue as many as we have foster home commitments. Fostering is a rewarding experience for your family.",

He is a small super mutt who is 9 years old. He\u2019s still a bit active and his favorite activities are playing fetch, running around in the backyard, and chasing the cat at his foster home. As much as he loves his activities, he\u2019s a total cuddle bug. Charlie loves to sit on his foster mom\u2019s lap or curled up with the resident senior dog. They patrol the neighborhood together from the window. He has gotten along fine with the other dogs who are in his foster house.\n\nCharlie loves his crate and has no problem with going in there to lay down when no one is home. He will also alert his foster mom when he needs to go outside. Charlie would be suitable for a home with dogs, but would also be perfectly happy as a single companion lap dog.\n\nCharlie is being fostered in Kettering by Whitney.\n\nContact this foster home at whitney.tobias@gmail.com\n\nTo Adopt This Pup:\n\nGo to PPR's Applications Page at www.puppypalsrescue.com and apply!\n\nPlease email the foster home to let them know you have applied, as sometimes forms seem to get lost in cyberspace.\n",

Pathology lab results indicate it was bone cancer but being a tri-pod doesn't slow this girl down - she is an active and playful 1.5 years old Doberman mix.  This young lady is re-living her puppyhood. \n\nLuna dearly loves to chew on toys and anything else she can get her paws on!  (I still don't know how she managed to get ahold of one of my wooden spoons but she had stashed it in one of the dog beds.)  She is house broken and knows how to use a doggy door.  Luna vocalizes when excited and sounds like a Wookie!  She likes people and enjoys the companionship of the other dogs in her foster home.  \n\nDRNM would consider placing Luna in the right forever home.

They missed out-he is friendly, outgoing, and so so happy to be near his people. That makes sense, we guess, because the owner said he was an outside dog, so not sure how much time he spent with him. But Barnes holds no grudges against humans and loves everyone. When he first meets you, he is so excited that he does jump up to greet you so probably no young kids at this point until he knows how to properly sit and greet calmly. He's working on it. He has sit down pat for his dinner, that is for sure. He likes his food :) Barnes is a very high energy dog, though, and needs a very active home that will exercise him regularly and knows how to tire out a Siberian.\nBarnes is good with other dogs. He is still a young active dog so he'd probably be a bit too much for a sedate or senior dog. But he likes to play with other dogs. We are looking for an active home for him with someone who is willing to put in some basic training to make him the perfect house dog. He will be a perfect boy in no time.",

He's not only an award winning cuddler, this eight month old, sweater-wearing stud muffin is also very smart and curious and is so adorable that even cat-people stop to gush over him.\n\nEverhart loves everyone that he meets and quickly makes himself comfortable wherever he goes. He weighs about 45lbs, loves to play with other dogs, is an A+ travel passenger and is quickly learning that all of the cool dogs are housetrained.\n\nWhen he isn't napping or playing with his dog friends he enjoys belly rubs, spending more time smelling things than actually walking during his daily walks around the neighborhood, throwing his toys in the air and catching them, prancing around while incessantly squeaking his toy after a successful catch and, well, probably deciding when he'll take his next nap.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Everhart please submit an inquiry directly with Greater Charlotte SPCA by visiting charlottespca.org/adopt.\n\n***Because our rescue is composed entirely of volunteers and we require a home check for each of our adoptable pets prior to them going to their new homes, local applications will take precedence. We will accept out of town applications, but any family further than 60 miles from Charlotte is responsible for finding a representative of a rescue local to them that is willing to perform the home check. All out of town applicants will also have to be willing to drive to Charlotte to meet/pick up the pet as soon as the application is approved.***",

He will be neutered and fully vetted by us. He\u2019s a friendly little guy and will warm up quickly with new people. We would prefer an all adult household for him as we don\u2019t know him well enough yet to know how he is with kids. We will update this listing as we learn more about him.\n",

All of our animals live in foster homes comfortably which means that we can take our time to find the best possible home for each animal in our care. \n\nTo learn more about the Little Lotus adoption process, please go to:\nhttps://littlelotusrescueandsanctuary.org/adoption-process/\n\nFor an application to meet this pet, please go to:https://littlelotusrescueandsanctuary.org/adoption-application/\n\nBeing fostered in Sierra Vista, AZ.

Takes some time to settle but overall doing well with his crate training\nDog sociability: Reportedly dog-friendly from transferring shelter. Hasn't had too much interaction with dogs in current foster home.\nCat sociability: Unknown\nKids: Not a match - he can startle easily and does best with adults.\nIdeal home: Winston is a sweet and sensitive guy looking for a calm, adult-only home that will allow him to warm up to them and decompress. He would prefer to not live in a high-rise/elevator building but is adaptable to other living environments. \n\nSwipe right if you're looking for a handsome gentleman with eyes that will make you melt! Winston is a loving, gentle, and loyal companion who is seeking his forever home to enjoy endless hugs and kisses. Winston is a polite, house trained, and relaxed dog who will always make you feel loved as he is most comfortable snuggled up next to you. When he's not chewing on his bone, Winston loves to play ball and won't object if you sneak him an extra treat after a long walk or nap. Winston has endless love to give and promises to make you feel all the warm and fuzzies inside every time you see him! \n\nWinston's adoption fee is 300. He is neutered, up to date on core vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative.\n\n***We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications. We ask that you please be patient and someone will be in touch via email within 72 hours. Please do not email us unless you have not received a response in 72 hours.

            "description": "Jarret is living in a foster home. Submit an application from our website and then make an appointment to meet him.\n\nJarret is not eligible for foster and will be a straight adoption.\n\nAge: ~3 years \nWeight: ~58lbs\nHousebroken: Yes\nCrate trained: Working on it! Takes time to settle (10-30 minutes) and will benefit from continued training for this\nDog sociability: Friendly! Lives with dogs in his foster home and has been doing well. He is playful and can be a rough & tumble type of player, so does best with equally playful/tolerant dogs. On walks, he may pull towards dogs to meet them\nCat sociability: Unknown\nKids: Unknown, but can be sensitive to noise so likely best with older kiddos.\nIdeal home: Jarret is a sweet, active pup looking for a home that can work on training! He has some energy to burn and will do great in a home where he can exhaust his energy in positive ways. He would likely love a dog pal that can wrestle with him, or access to doggy daycare. He can be sensitive to apartment sounds, so he isn't a match for a large apartment building/noisy building and would prefer to not live in an elevator building.\n\nJarrett is a playful boy with a zest for life! He loves his people, he loves his dog friends, he loves walks, he loves naps, he just loves to love! Jarrett is easily excited but fortunately settles down easily as well- He's the perfect Sunday morning hike partner followed by Sunday afternoon nap partner. Jarrett doesn't know his own size and is working on his manners/basic training but with just how much he loves people we believe training him to be a very well-behaved best friend will be not only doable but a ton of fun! He's fully potty trained and sleeps 8 hours in his crate without issue. Jarrett is currently living in a foster home with 2 dogs and has been doing well.\n\nJarret's adoption fee is 300. He is neutered, up to date on core vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative. He will require booster vaccines at the adopter's expense.\n\n***We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications. We ask that you please be patient and someone will be in touch via email within 72 hours. Please do not email us unless you have not received a response in 72 hours. Please only fill out one adoption application. ***",

He's 12.5 lbs, red smooth, very active boy! Doxie saavy and stay at home only please apply. No other dogs, kids or cats, he must be the one and only. He has some nipping history with kids and other dogs. He adores walks,  car rides, snuggling, and burrowing under blankets. He loves his squeeker toys, but hedgehogs are his favorite. NO STEPS/STAIRS. He had a mild case of IVDD, doing great now. He is a great watchdog, but a little barky. He is on doggie xanax for some anxiety. This is one cute over the top little guy! Just needs a little patience and love. If you think you would be a good fit please fill out an application today!\n\nWillie Mays will do best in a family with a stay at home parent (work from home or retired) and only older children (over age 12), who are familiar with the special needs of Dachshunds.\n\nLike all Dachshunds, Willie Mays is high energy and enjoys playing and warming his little bones in the sunshine, so along with regular walks around his neighborhood, Willie Mays needs a secure fenced yard to run around and explore safely. While small in stature, doxies are big on personality and don't generally do well in apartments, with all of the noises and traffic that come with multiple dwellings in a confined space.  To best set up our doxies and their new families for success, ODR, Inc., adopt to families who live in single family homes with secure fenced yards.\n\nOUR CRITERIA (aka The Fine Print):\n\nBased on 30 years of experience with rescue doxies, we have pretty strict criteria. Do you work from home/stay at home/work part time?  Have a securely fenced yard? We do not place same gender dogs in a home unless they were raised together, and children need to be 12 or older (some exceptions IF the dog is a puppy or the child has been raised with a doxie). We prefer non smokers and a home with no other small animals (ferrets, hamsters, etc). Cats are on a case by case basis depending on the dog. Remember, these are rescues; many were surrendered because of these issues. \n\nWHAT YOU GET IN RETURN WITH YOUR LITTLE RESCUE:\n\nAll our dogs are fully vetted, including spay/neuter, rabies, DHPP, Bordetella, Pyrantyl, nails trimmed, and dental when needed. They'll come with a basket of goodies, food, toys and a custom made harness. The adoption fee is $495, sorry no exceptions, as this covers the cost to rescue them, vet them and take care of them while in our rescue. It also helps towards the care of other doxies that come with huge vet or dental bills or need extensive behavioral training.\n\nCan you give Willie Mays a happy, carefree life again? If interested, please complete the adoption questionnaire at www.odr-inc.org and email it to: jrangan@comcast.net \nThe adoption committee will attempt to be in contact with you within 48-72 hours. Please be patient as we are solely volunteer run.",

He tends to be on the calmer side, but still has his puppy energy!\nWe think he would do best in a home with another dog (or more) preferably medium to large sized, as he gets lonely without his siblings but likes to play somewhat rough!\n\nHe is doing great with potty training, kennel training and working on his manners. He will need a family that will continue to keep working on mastering these skills.\n\nIf you would like to meet our handsome Frenchie please fill out an app and set up a time to meet him.\n\nNeedy Paws Rescue\n\n1:56 PM (1 hour ago)\n\nto\nme\n\nIf interested, please\n\ncomplete the\n\nAdoption Application\n\non our website at\n\nwww.NeedyPaws.org\n\nand we will contact you.\n\nAdopters must live within an hour's drive of St. Louis, MO.\n\nOur $250 adoption fee includes up-to-date vaccinations, heartworm testing and preventative, spay/neuter and microchip.\n\nWe are a 100% foster-based rescue and all of our dogs live in approved foster homes.

Once we receive it, we'll forward it to the foster family for follow up. We are 100% foster based, so we don't have a facility. Review the process FAQ at our website.\n\nAdoption applications can be found here: http://labrescuefresno.org/available-labs/adoption-application/\n\nAdoption Fees Adult Dog (10 mos. - 7 years): $250.00 Puppy (9 mos. and under): $350.00 Senior (8 yrs. and up)/Special Needs Dog: $100.00\n\nBuddy, Black Male mix, 5 year old, 90 lbs.\nHowdy Lab lovers! My name is Buddy - seriously, that's what my owner named me. If you have something more original in mind, I'm open to changing my name. My pre-rescue life is a bit of a mystery. All I can tell you is that one day some people in uniforms came and separated me from my owner and took me to the Animal Shelter. It was very noisy there and I didn't like it at all. But after a couple of weeks, one of the wonderful people from the Defenders of Dogs picked me up and took me to her house. I'd be plenty happy to stay here forever, but she explained to me that it has to be temporary so she can rescue another pup like me and that she will find me the very best forever home. Though I really do love living with my foster family, I also really want more dogs like me to get their forever families too, so let's do this! My heart is open and full of love to give to my forever family!\nAt my foster home, I have three dog siblings and a cat. I get along with them all. I've met a few new people, including one really little person - like so little that I'm taller than she is! I accidentally knocked her down in my excitement to meet all the new people, but she just laughed, so we're all good.\nYou may notice from my glamour shots that I have a bit of white on my face, ears and feet. The people at the animal shelter estimated my age at 4-5 years. My foster mom thinks some of that white hair may be whatever breed(s) I am mixed with or some of us are just blessed with premature grey hair - hey I think it looks quite distinguished! I do like to play like a younger pup and I am very strong. Besides playing with my foster brother, my favorite thing to do is to snooze on the sofa with my foster mom. By the way, for those glamour shots, I had to get a bath, and I don't like water at all! Yuck! Bleh! Pooey!\nBuddy is house-trained, crate-trained, he knows \"sit\", and is very affectionate and loving. He is a strong athletic guy and needs to work on his leash manners, so Buddy will do best with a family that is committed to taking training classes together to master proper leash skills and ensure a lifetime of good behavior. Buddy is quite an energetic fella for his age and will need a family who is willing and able to exercise him daily.\nLooking for a best friend? If you want to make Buddy a member of your family forever, please apply today at www.labrescuefresno.org.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting through Labrador Retriever Rescue of Fresno, you must first fill out an Adoption Application located at our website www.LabRescueFresno.org All dogs are spayed/neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccines including rabies; flea/tick topical drops, heartworm tested and microchipped.

            "description": "Lulu is an adorable girl that we pulled from a local kill shelter. She is about 8 months old and weighs only 11 pounds. This pup has a gorgeous, soft black coat with just a tiny bit of white stripe on her chest. Lulu is perfectly crate trained and sleeps on a very nice plush dog bed. In the short time we have had her, she has never had an accident so it is possible she may already be house-trained. Unfortunately we are not able to know for sure. Friendly & sweet, Lulu is also a bit timid and is still getting used to our place as well as walking on a leash. Lulu loves everyone she meets and is more than happy to snuggle in your lap. She is used to being crated at night and playing in a safe, fenced yard during the day with other foster pups the same size. Lulu seems fine with other dogs but would be best placed in a home without cats. Lulu is now healthy, fully vetted and ready for her forever home. Her wish list consists of an inside forever home with a big fenced yard for playtime, a home with lots of toys and another doggy friend for play time and pet parents who understand the time commitment that a new dog requires. Adopters who are retired or work-from-home parents are ideal as they have the time to spend with the pet. Adopters committed to doing a 6 week basic obedience class to ensure Lulu's successful transition into a new home environment would also a plus (and to ensure the new puppy parent's education level). If you think you have the perfect home for Lulu, contact us at info.caresga@gmail.com for an adoption application. We adopt up north and all over so please ask for details. $400 adoption fee and a vet reference is required to ensure a great home (this means you have had a pet so we can call to verify their level of care). Eligibility for adoption means your current or past pets are spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccines and on monthly heartworm and flea prevention. Please be aware that we do not allow shock collars (ie underground fences) or \"pens\" as an alternative for a fenced yard.\n\nWe do our best to place our rescue pets in the very best homes. Please be aware that we have an application which also includes required vet records showing your existing pets are current on preventative medical care. Puppy adopters please take note that we generally try to place our puppies into homes where at least one parent is retired/stay at home/works from home to ensure the puppy gets enough attention and training (puppies cannot hold it all day in a crate) so please have a plan ready when contacting us. For safety reasons, we try not to place small dogs or puppies in families with children under 5 (there may be exceptions depending on situation).\n\nTypical adoption fees for puppies are $350, juvenile dogs $300, adults dogs are $250, senior dogs are $150. Some pets, smaller dogs for example, may have a higher than normal adoption fee but we will alert you if there is a variance. Dogs rescued from China always have a higher adoption fee. Adoption fees help our group offset PART of the cost of rescuing, rehabilitating, and getting the pet healthy so they can go on to find a loving home with someone willing to give them a second chance at life. This amount includes each animal being current on age appropriate vaccinations including DHPPL, bordetella, influenza, rabies, and boosters when appropriate. De-wormed for any internal parasites (round worms, hook worms, tape worms and whipworms) with Drontal Plus, 4DX tested heart-worm negative (if positive, they are treated), tested negative for tick borne diseases, spayed/neutered, implanted with a micro-chip and have been examined by a veterinarian to certify that they are healthy. Any other known health issues are treated as well prior to adoption (examples: UTI, broken bones, contagious infections, dental cleanings, etc). All animals are also on a regime of flea and heartworm medication every month. Lifetime registration for the micro-chip is included in each adoption fee. In addition, each adopter will go home with a fitted collar, tags, a bag of dog food the pet has been on, copies of all vet history, and an adoption kit filled with valuable information and coupons as well as other various treats or toys as promotions become available. All puppy adoptions include two puppy training books, the Puppy Primer & Way To Go by Patricia McConnell, and all adult adoptions go home with Love Has No Age Limit by Patricia McConnell to help ensure a smooth transition for your new family member.\n\nWe ask that you consider an additional donation on top of this pet's adoption fee. This money will go directly into our Adoption Fund to be used exclusively for rescuing and caring for other pets in need. Many pets we take in have very high vet bills to get them healthy and adoptable for the public - much higher than their adoption fees. We receive no government funding and rely solely on donations from our community and caring adopters to continue our rescue efforts!",

Completely pottytrained.He lately has been licking his paws a lot more recently: owner think it might be allergies or anxiety.Notes from previous owner:Initially got him from an old coworker.Lived with two kids (4 & 11 years old) - did well, very sweet.Lived in an apartment.Great with visitors.Hardly ever barks (only whines if he sees a stray cat outside).Hasn't ever met a cat close-up.Lived with 3 other dogs in his previous home (small & large breeds). In this owner's home, he lived with a pit bull puppy.Got along with all of them - playful, sweet, even ate out of the same food bowls.No vet records.Inside dog - outside just to potty.Completely potty trained - will hold it for a very long time. Comfortable with a crate but didn't have to use it - said he was loose in the house when home alone and will just hang out and sleep until she comes home.",

Officer were eventually able to catch them.No owner ever came for them.Grover had bad hairloss and sore from his waist down. He also has fly bites and scabs all over his ears.He was underweight with his hip bones protruding.He had a black strap tied in a knot around his neck, with buckles on it (possibly from a suitcase or backpack?). Comfortable with car rides!He can be a little shy with new people and things, but is getting more and more confident with people, visitors, leash-walking, etc.Would recommend a meet and greet if adopters have another dog - Grover liked to bark at/barrier fight with the rowdy dog in the kennel next to him.",

She is all about the cuddles and play time. \u00a0\nHeidi is exceedingly smart and responds to training quickly especially when there are treats involved. She is absolutely food motivated and eager to please.\u00a0Heidi loves long walks that last upwards of 45-minutes but is just as happy with 2-3 shorter walks (roughly around the block) throughout the day. \u00a0She has been crate trained but still requires a little encouragement when it's time for bed. Heidi is a vocal dog who loves to be outside chasing squirrels and birds and rodents and when she is not outside she can usually be found staring out of the window watching the world outside. \u00a0She loves to play with furry toys but rarely destroys them! Loves deer antlers and peanut butter shoved inside larger bones.\u00a0\nIf you're a runner or hiker you are missing out if you pass up the opportunity to adopt this dog. Please consider making her part of your family. She will be forever grateful. \n\nAdoption Process: Please visit http://heavenlypawsmi.com/adoptions and fill out an Adoption Questionnaire.\n\nAdoption Costs: There is a $175.00 adoption fee to support the care and well being of all of our adoptable pets. Heavenly Paws of Michigan is a strong supporter of spay and neutering. Thank you for your interest in saving a shelter dog.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Please contact Mary (MHSAbbyRescue@gmail.com) for more information about this pet.Cinnamon's adoption donation is $325 and she is being fostered in Central Ohio. She has been spayed, microchipped, received her rabies, distemper/parvo, bivalent canine influenza, and bordetella vaccines, tested negative for heartworms and started on prevention, as well as flea prevention. Cinnamon has also had a dental cleaning.\nShe will require a home with a companion dog of similar size and a secure, physically fenced yard.\n\nCinnamon is a a sweet girl who was surrendered to our rescue from a commercial breeder. Cinnamon is an appproximately 8-9 year old Yorkie or Silky mix. She is learning how to be a dog and had made significant progress in rescue. Cinnamon does well on housetraining if kept on a schedule. Just like most mill dogs, she is learning how to be a dog and discovering new things all the time, but she is shy and does things on her schedule. She loves other dogs and definitely looks to them for guidance. She will need a patient, experienced adopter who will give her the time to decompress and settle into her new home.\nCinnamon will require a home with a companion dog of similar size and a secure, physically fenced yard.\nPLEASE NOTE: If you are viewing this biography on a website other than the Ohio Fuzzy Pawz website, not all information transfers to partner websites in some instances. If you go to the individual webpage of our dogs, you will be able to get more information each dog.\n\nVisual breed identification in dogs can be unreliable so, in many cases, we are only guessing at the predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n\nOur Adoption Process\n\nThe adoption process has several steps involved.\n\nPlease review prior to submitting an application.\nOur adoption process is detailed here:\n\nhttp://www.ohiofuzzypawz.com/info/adoption\n\nOur volunteers work very diligently to process each application and we try to ensure that we are making the best match possible for each dog. We do not schedule meetings with dogs until an application has been approved. It can take up to a few weeks to process an application or as little time as a few days, from the time you submit an application, please be prepared to adopt as we cannot hold dogs.\n\nSpecial Requirements\n\nSome dogs may have special requirements (for example, medications, a fence) -- if you apply for a dog, please be sure to read over the biography completely to see if there are any special needs and if you're home would be suitable. If we indicate on the dog's biography that a fence is required, this means your home must have a physical fence. Other dogs may require a \"strong vet reference\" which indicates that we are looking for a home that has a documented history of veterinary care with previous pets.\n\nThe first step in our process is to submit an online adoption application at www.ohiofuzzypawz.com/forms. The application MUST include the personal references and veterinary, grooming, and landlord references (if applicable) and their respective contact information. If you do not include the references and the contact information, your application will be delayed as it CANNOT be processed. Once the references have been successfully completed, a home visit is then scheduled when a rescue representative can meet all members of the family or residents of the home.\nNo application is approved prior to the home visit being done.\nAt that point, the Directors will discuss any and all applications on a foster dog and make a selection--in many cases, there are multiple applications for each dog, so please be understanding that our only priority is the successful placement of each of our foster dogs.\n\nOut of State Adoptions\n\nWe do adopt out of state to outstanding applicants, however, our process requires a home visit, so out of state adoptions can take longer.\nWe do not ship our dogs, adopters should be prepared to pick up the dog in Central Ohio.",

A fence is required.\n\nThis sweet girl absolutely loves people, to be in your arms, in your lap or just next to you! She also loves her brothers and other dogs, she doesn't like to be far from the action! She likes to run, play and explore, then find a comfy blanket to take a nap! And she's a sassy little thing, don't let that cute face fool you!\n\nWe think she would do best in a home with another dog (or more), as she doesn't like to be alone!\n\nShe is doing great with potty training, kennel training and working on her manners. She will need a family that will continue to keep working on mastering these skills.\n\nIf you would like to meet our beautiful girl, please fill out an app and set up a time to meet her.\n\nIf interested, please\ncomplete the\nAdoption Application\non our website at\nwww.NeedyPaws.org\nand we will contact you.\nAdopters must live within an hour's drive of St. Louis, MO.\n\nOur $250 adoption fee includes up-to-date vaccinations, heartworm testing and preventative, spay/neuter and microchip.\n\nWe are a 100% foster-based rescue and all of our dogs live in approved foster homes.

I'm an adorable, stout, muscular bundle of energy with perky ears and gorgeous brown eyes. I'll bet you are wondering how I got my name, aren't you? Well, it's because I wiggle all over non-stop when I meet new friends. I just get so darn excited that I can't help it. My favorite thing is to be close to people. Cuddling, belly rubs, and pets? Yes, please! Besides affection, I also enjoy playing with toys, but sometimes I don't like to share. I want them all for myself. The volunteers call me 'Houdini' because I have mastered opening the doors at the shelter, so you'll need to do some puppy proofing at home. I used to be a stray, so I'm a little needy and fearful, and I bark due to separation anxiety. It's only because I want to be with my special person, an experienced dog owner who will go slowly with me and teach me not to be so fearful of things. Objects that you find normal scare me sometimes, and I need time to get used to them, build my trust, and show me the world is a good place. You won't regret it, and I'll be your friend for life. Don't tell anyone, but I'm wiggling just thinking about meeting you!\nAdoption Information: Size: Medium/weighs 45 pounds Children: No Dogs: No Cats: No Adoption fee: $300 This dog is neutered, microchipped and has had a full veterinary checkup and vaccines.\nIf you are interested in more information or would like to meet this dog, please fill out our online adoption survey: carenorthshore.org/dog-adoption-survey",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Please contact APe for more information about this pet.Thanks for your interest in a pet from A.R.F.! If you see a pet here, they are still available for adoption and you should apply through our adoption application on our website at https://www.arf-il.org/adopt/application/\nHi my name is Brewer! My previous family said my DNA test listed my primary breed as Boxer, but my ARF peeps think I look a bit like a Rhodesian Ridgeback mix too. Either way, I am a handsome boy if I do say so myself! My foster parents call me a gentle giant, because I am a big boy who weighs in at 80 pounds. I am about 4 years old, very sweet, and house-trained. I still love to run and play and would love a fenced in yard. I know a number of commands like \"sit\", \"stay\", \"down\", and \"place\". I don't use my bark often, but when I do, it is because I hear something scary and I need to protect you! After a long day of playing and exercise, I will cuddle up next to my humans on the couch. I do really well on walks and I can sleep nicely in my crate at night. I can get along with kids but I prefer that they are older and know how to give me my space. I would prefer to be the only animal because I am a bit of an \"alpha\" and might mount other dogs when I feel threatened. Overall, my foster parents love me! I am so excited for my forever home.\n\nBrewer is micro-chipped, up to date on all vaccinations, housebroken and neutered. His new family will be required to complete a basic obedience course of their choosing.\n\nBrewer's adoption fee is $300. A meeting will not be scheduled until you have an approved application, so if you're interested in adopting Brewer fill out an Online Application today!\n\nOnce your application has been approved, an ARF volunteer will contact you to arrange a meeting.\n\nThank you for considering a rescue pet from A.R.F.-Animal Rescue Foundation! We are\nbased in Wheaton, IL and conduct adoption events in the DuPage County area. If you are interested in adopting one of our pets, please submit an adoption application at https://www.arf-il.org/adopt/application/\n\nAdoption appointments are scheduled based on the order of applications received, so submit your application early! Submitting an application does not commit you to any animal but does get you a head start with the adoption approval process. Due to a high volume of applications, we are often unable to respond to questions or schedule meetings until your application has been approved. More information about our adoption process can be found on our website here: https://www.arf-il.org/adopt/\n\nAs an all-volunteer, foster home-based organization, A.R.F. Animal Rescue Foundation does not have a facility where applicants can visit our animals. Please visit https://www.arf-il.org/events/ for a list of our upcoming adoption events.\n\nThank you for choosing to adopt, not shop!",

He is 1 year old, weighs 50 pounds and he has that classic black and white Border Collie coloring.  Bailey is housebroken, crate-trained, and while he knows his basic obedience commands the does not always choose to follow them!  He walks nicely on leash and he is a very good passenger in the car.\nBailey is a friendly guy who loves people.  Bailey is a high energy, medium-to-high Velcro boy who does have an \u201coff switch\u201d but a lot of play happens before then!  He loves to do almost anything active with his foster family \u2013 walking, hiking, playing ball, etc.  He also LOVES to play with other dogs.  He did not have a chance to play with other dogs before he was rescued, and he is still learning how to \u201ctalk dog\u201d.  He sometimes misses their cues when other dogs have had enough of the game; he just loves to play and play and play.  Bailey also chases cats, squirrels, bugs, birds, anything that he spots while running in the yard!\nThe ideal home for Bailey is an active one, shared with a family who loves to play and is ready to add another frisky player to the \u201chome team\u201d.  A fenced yard and another young, playful dog are required, Border Collie experience is a plus, children over the age of 12 are welcome (he still jumps up on people and could easily knock over a small child!), and no cats please.  Bailey is a diamond in the rough; a fun-loving, happy, active guy with so much potential who needs a family that will continue his training and include him in the action.  We think he may enjoy dog sports that challenge his body and brain!  If you are ready for a Bailey in your life, apply today!  Bailey is fostered in Birchwood, TN.\n",
