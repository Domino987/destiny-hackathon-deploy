Savo does great with other dogs and would love to have a companion in his new home, he is not however a fan of cats or young hyper children so an adult only home would be required. Savo was surrendered to ESK due to his previous family being unable to care for him anymore, but that has not changed his spirits. He is a fun loving goof ball that loves to roll around in the grass and chase his friends here at doggie daycare, he loves long walks in the park and running around in the yard. He is a very relaxed handsome man with a gentle soul. Savo needs a home that will be able to provide for his active lifestyle and temperament, he loves everyone he meets and creates a very strong bond and connection to his people.",

During the coldest night of the year she broke into their shed and found a blanket and curled up in it trembling and they finally realized she had no one looking for her. She came to us that night and has been the most thankful dog ever since. She doesn't much care for other dogs. She is fine in passing but probably shouldn't live with one, and no cats. She is seriously sooo sweet and would make an amazing companion for any home that's quieter and doesnt mind a shadow. she's not the cutest but her heart is HUGE",

            "description": "Jupiter, or JupJup as we call her, is a very sweet natured girl who is about 2 years old and weighs 38 lbs. She has not had an easy life. She lived her first two years on her own as a stray until she was picked up by animal services and was rescued by Furever After just in time to avoid being euthanized. At first she had a slow time adjusting to life inside, but she has really blossomed into a most incredible little girl. She is short and compact and totally adorable. We have only heard one bark ever, so she's a pretty quiet girl. She is crate trained and house trained. She gets better walking on a leash every time she goes out. Jupiter is still young and has bursts of playful energy and would be best in a household with a playmate/fur sibling. She can play rough, so her fur sibling would need to match her size and strength or be a little larger. She is not yet kid or cat tested. She would probably be a little too much for smaller children. \nInside she would like to have her own special spot or spots to chill in. She is not overly nosy and does not like to explore too much. When she does want to cuddle, she cuddles hard, but she isn't overly affectionate yet. Jup is silly and when she's being playful, she will have you cracking up hard. She does very well eating her dinner in her crate, but would be ok eating anywhere that she can eat alone. She doesn't love being in the crate during the day, but she's working on it. She's good at night in her crate, but would rather be in bed with you. \n\nIn short, Jupiter is a sweet girl who wants to snuggle at night and play with her fur siblings during the day. She would love to find a home where she can feel safe and secure and loved.\n\nIf you are interested in giving Jupiter a forever home, please visit the link below to fill out an application! http://fureverafterrescue.org/adoption-application.html It is best to submit an application through a computer. We have experienced some problems when applications have been submitted using a mobile device. *When you submit the application, you are not obligated to adopt however it does reserve for you the opportunity to adopt that particular animal. We review them on a first come first served basis. If your application is approved, we will contact you and allow you the opportunity to adopt. If you choose not to adopt, we will contact the next approved applicant. If you have any questions or difficulties, please contact us we will be glad to help!",

I recently arrived in rescue after my previous owner got very sick and could no longer care for me. I\u2019m approx. 10 years old and overall I feel pretty fit. My Foster Mom says I will be seeing a Vet very soon for a well check and after that will be ready to go to my new furever home. I am potty trained & I sleep well in my own bed through the night. I get along well with other small dogs, but don't care for the bigger ones so much. Foster Mom says while I am one cool little dude, I would do best in a home without small children. You see, I am still a little cautious when being picked up, but I am working on it. I spend my days hanging out in the backyard, sneaking naps in a dark corner, lounging around, going on short walks with my Foster Family, playing with toys & boy howdy, I LOVE mealtime! If you\u2019re interested in me you can start the process by sending in an application to this awesome rescue so my Foster Mom can arrange a meet cute. That's me, I'm cute! Woof!!\n\nIf you want to help with this dog\u2019s medical expenses: \nhttps://therescuedrescuers.org/how-to-help\n\nIf you want to adopt this dog, apply at the link! \nhttps://therescuedrescuers.org/adoption-application",

He is a 5 year old Rottweiler/mix from Texas. \nHe loves going on walks, playing in the park, riding in cars, playing with ropes, tennis balls, chewing on bones, or just wanting to be petted or cuddled.\nHe would be very happy in a home with lots of daily exercise! When it comes to other dogs, he gets along with most. Flag does NOT get along with cats.  Overall he is a very happy guy!\nHe is about 60lbs. up to date on my shots, and even microchipped!\nHe will need to be the only dog in the home.\nHe is living in the Sheboygan county area if you'd love to meet him! \n\n***UPDATE 12.24.20 :  Flag - Adoption Fee Sponsored!\nFlag has been waiting for the right person to rescue him and we had hope that a Veteran looking for a companion would be a great match.  No one came forward so now we are opening the application to all people. Flag's family must be out there somewhere!\nFlag is a happy and loving guy.  He has a good amount of energy and would love to join you for adventures, car rides and walks.  Flag would need a home without cats.  He gets along with most dogs, but would be best to be the only pet.  \nFlag is 60lb, 5year old Rottweiler Mix \nBeing Fostered in Sheboygan county area\nAdoption Fee has been generously sponsored  -  foster will determine best match for Flag\nPlease go to www.lastpawrescue.org and fill out an application.\nFull Bio https://www.petfinder.com/.../sheb.../last-paw-rescue-wi439/\n501(c) approved Wisconsin Agriculture License # 285589-DS",

She and her sister Gravy were found outside of a restaurant in Mobile when they were two weeks old and luckily sent to rescue. Gravy has found an amazing home and now it is Bisquits' turn!\n\nBisquits is smart, sweet, and kennel trained. She has picked up commands easily and will thrive with a family/Individual that will continue her training. She is a wiggle butt aka she has a nub instead of a tail! She is almost completely potty trained but still has some accidents. She has been very well socialized in her foster home, getting along with dogs of all sizes and even cats. Her foster mom says she loves to chew on bones and play with toys! She will sit on your lap and receive tummy rubs and give kisses forever!! She is pretty vocal so might not be great for apartment living and she must have another dog in her home to help keep her out of trouble... or join in.\n\nAmazing Grace Bully Rescue is a foster based rescue in the Pensacola, Florida area. We do not have a physical building. If you would like to meet any of our pups, the first step is to fill out our online application so we can contact you.\n\nOur adoption fee for Bisquits is $225 and includes four sets of puppy shots, two dewormings (done prior to adoption) her spay, current shots, rabies vaccine, and a registered microchip.\n\nIf you would like to adopt this Amazing dog, please fill out our online adoption application at www.amazinggracebullyrescue.org\n\nIf you have any questions, please text your question to 723-2037. You may also send a message to our Amazing Grace Bully Rescue Page on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or send an email directly to amazinggracebullyrescue@gmail.com\n\nDisclaimer: We are located in the Pensacola, Florida area and will consider local applicants first, especially with puppies since we use a vet in the local area.",

            "description": "A beautiful BIG Shepherd mix who needs some training and exercise. He's young, he's playful, he's energetic, and he's a shepherd...put those together and you get trouble in the wrong home. In the right homes these guys just flourish. Wylie needs a strong owner able to handle him. He's good with other dogs but on initial meetings he can be quite pushy, so a dog able to tolerate and deflect that into playtime is ideal. He grew up with cats, but likes to try to get them to run so he can be pushy with cats as well. With another young dog to help him play, get some energy used up, he's not as bad...but if he's been cooped up without a playmate or exercise he gets more and more amped up. He's gorgeous, just turned 2 years old. He has quite the potential to be an amazing dog, but he will require some work to get there. At Autumn Acres Animal Rescue we believe each individual animal matters. We take in special cases some of which will stay with us as a sanctuary dog.If the animal is listed as a Socially Imperfect Dog this means they have special needs and special requirements for potential adopters.If the animal is listed as a Socially Imperfect RESIDENT this animal is NOT available for adoption and is one of our sanctuary residents. We list them on our sites because they still matter and they still need donations to help with their long term care.Check out our website for more information: http://www.autumnacres.org",

I am a beautiful pup who loves people.. ANY PEOPLE but I am meant to be an only pet. My petite 40 lbs means Im able to go adventuring with you! I have to admit I really need to learn some manners and get a bit better at calming down. At home I love to play outside or cuddle in bed. Wont you open up a sunny spot in your life for this little moon pie?\n\nLuna is a 2-year-old, 40-pound pitbull mix. She is UTD, spayed and chipped. She's a people lover, of any age... but does best as an only pet. She is housebroken and crate trained. \n\nAdoption requirements are as such:\n\n\n\tNo other pets \n\tLarge dog experience \n\n\nUnfortunately, Luna's owners do not have the time to dedicate to her that she needs and feels it's best to rehome her to a family that will work through her. She will need an experienced home that will work with her to gain some manners. \n\nPlease note, Luna is part of Happy Trails Animal Rescues rehoming program. She has not been tested or evaluated and the information gathered is from the current owners personal statements regarding health and temperament. The owner is subject to placement outside of our organization. We cannot guarantee availability.",

            "description": "Its not every day that you get the chance to meet Mr. Perfect. Sully is a stunning 4-year-old Retriever mix who weighs around 75 pounds. He came to the rescue in June after it was found that he had a large mass on his side as well as being heartworm positive. After a risky operation, our vet was able to remove part of the tumor but sadly discovered that a large portion is in an inoperable area. Regardless of his medical diagnosis, Sully is a happy pup who deserves to live out his life with a family that will love him endlessly. Hes a simple fella who leads a chill life filled with slobbery kisses and couch cuddles. Sully enjoys spending time with other playful dogs and people of all ages. He lives for belly rubs, treats, and lap naps. Sully is truly a wonderful companion. The right family for him will be one who understands that while we may not be able to add years to his life, the love he has to offer is immeasurable. If you live in central FL and are interested in fostering-to-adopt sweet Sully, please complete our screening form here: https://mettarescuefamily.org/adoptable-dogs",

Shes easy going, and loves nothing more than curling up on the couch with her humans. She has a goofy smile and likes to talk when shes happy. Shiraz loves her food, shes a very good assistant in the kitchen - always there to lend a hand and eat anything that accidentally falls on the floor. Shes a playful girl... every morning she likes to play with her toys and then promptly snoozes away the afternoon.\n\nAll dogs will be altered, microchipped, and receive age-appropriate vaccines prior to adoption. Please note that the listed location for this dog may not be accurate due to technical limitations of this database and we have transportation options available within 6 hours of NYC (so don't let location hold you back)!\n\nInterested in fostering or adopting?

            "description": "Meg is a sweet shepherd mix girl about 8 years old weighing about 65lb.  Meg's a great dog. Loves pets from people. \n\nShe's like a nice quiet house, without a lot of stairs for now.  Meg's owner should be aware she's moving into senior territory.  She'll need good food and good vet care. She was picked up as a stray in Idaho and could use some TLC.\n\nShe's quiet and likes to lay by your feet.  She loves walks but can be kind of a puller so we're using a no-pull harness with her now.\n\nMeg is ok with other calm dogs but she should be the only dog in the home. She's doesn't like the younguns being too nosey so she'll tell dogs that get in her face to back off with a bark.  She won't pick a fight or move to be around other dogs.  She's kind of the prim and proper type. Likes well behaved dogs! No cats for her.\n\nShe's taking some joint supplements for her hips and does very well.  \n\nShe was placed briefly in a home and did well there.  She proved to be to strong to walk for the new owner.\n\n\nMeg is spayed, microchipped, and up to date on vaccinations. Her adoption fee is $300. Please fill out an application to meet her.\n\n\n",

            "description": "Happy continued National Pit Bull Awareness month on this lovely Train-A-Bull Thursday! Do y'all know how easily these puppers learn things? Introducing Mags......she's a youngster at barely one year old. Gal is hyper and distracted and dog reactive in the kennel/kennel area. This was my first time meeting her and I was already thinking, \"yikes! I may have to skip to next week's dog because she's never gonna sit still!!\" (Side note, Tank, who WAS up for his debut today got adopted!!) Moving on. :) After letting Mags explore the living room area, we got down to business to see what tricks she had up her sleeve. Well, not many, but just look at the focus on that poochie's face when I did have her attention! Tasty treats helped, too. Dogs, especially pitties LOVE TO BE TOLD WHAT TO DO!!! They need it! They must know that they are not in charge, that you are, and when you establish that relationship, these puppers are some of the most loyal, well behaved and loving pets. You don't have to yell, but be firm and consistent and praise, praise praise when they get a command right! Also, about 10 minutes is max time for a training session. And it's been said that's equivalent to 30 minutes of physical exercise (imagine how fit you're gonna be!! ????) Mags' adoption fee (and all her pit mix friends) has been reduced to $49 until the end of October",

She is not the biggest fan of other pets, but she will tolerate them when she is out and about on a LEASH.   \nAn ideal home would be with an active family, a nice tall fence since she can be a little Houdini and someone to show her loves, care and affection.\nShe is Spayed, micro-chipped, UTD on vaccines.  \nAdoption fee $100.00\nFor more information please call 509-787-4718 EXT 533\n",

Zeus will be the best snuggle buddy you have ever had! He does need a bit of leash training because he does like to pull on the leash.

            "description": "Through no fault of her own, Ellie is looking for a new home. With her family displaced and multiple housing falling through, she's been in boarding for 6 months. Her mommy worries everyday about her quality of life and knows that she's not happy being in a kennel. With no housing opportunities in sight, Ellie's well-being is the utmost priority. Ellie is quite the character. She's a 9 year old bull terrier mix. She absolutely loves being around her people and enjoys chewing on her bones. Overall, she's a mellow pup that loves to relax in her beds (yes, she has multiple ones around the house haha) but does get her nighttime zoomies. After her best friend and older brother passed 2 years ago, she hasn't been accepting of other dogs. She is protective over her people and doesn't like when strange animals come near. She thinks she's a little dog, not some 55 pounds of muscle, and therefore would do best in a home with no small children. They also give her a lot of anxiety since they're loud and all over the place. She does get excited easily so a low key home without a lot of foot traffic would be ideal. She needs a family who is going to be patient and allow her a few weeks to get settled. She does have anxiety and allergies but her mom is willing to sponsor her adoption fee and allergy medication for life. Her mom just wants her to be happy and is determined to find the perfect home for her. Ellie's adoption includes spaying, micro chipping and up to date shots. Please contact Outreach@sjras.org to help Ellie.",

She is spayed and current on all her shots now.  Zoey is an energetic super friendly girl that loves attention.  She doesn't even want to be outside in the play yard for long unless you go out too.  Zoey is strong for her size and does like to pull on the leash to go where she wants to go!  She seems curious about the other dogs, but we don't know if she gets along with other dogs or cats since she came to us from animal control.  Her background is unknown to us.  Zoey is an enthusiastic \"greeter\" and can be rambunctious enough that we recommend a home without really young children.  Zoey is housebroke and would love to have a forever home!",

She thinks she is a lap pet - and she is not that big s- o for a big lap she is good. She is very affectionate, beautiful and deserves respect at 6 years old. She loves to be pet and massaged. You can move her with a leash on her without any issue. She can be resource guarding but is easily redirected. If you are looking for an affectionate companion that you can treat as a respected family member Hershey is for you. She is crate trained but prefers a bed.\n\nShe is not agreeable to being pulled by the collar or forced to do something she does not want to do. She does not like being picked up. She will nip if put in these situations. At her age - she is well behaved enough to know what is right. So force or coercion is unnecessary.\n\nAll dogs and puppies are fully wormed, receive rabies and core vaccinations, microchipped, behavior assessed with other dogs and humans (sorry, no cat testing is done here), spend a minimum of 3 weeks free-ranging within a pack of 30 dogs to grow confidence and trust and may have DNA results. All dogs receive lifetime behavior support and can be returned anytime without a fee.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: You MUST complete an adoption application in order to see or adopt a dog from us. The completed adoption application ensures your 'spot' in order of adoption. Emailing/calling with questions will delay your adoption process.

He is super sweet, loves attention and people and is very playful.\nADOPTION FEES Dogs & Puppies.....$100.00. This Adoption fee includes: mandatory spay/neuter which will be done before you can take your dog or puppy home with you; basic canine immunizations (DHPP-CPV & Bordatella Intranasal); de-wormings; one-year rabies vaccination if old enough; heartworm test if over five months old; microchip from 24-Pet Watch; certificate for free health examination at your participating veterinarian; and a goodie bag chocked full of information, toys, and more.\n\nThe first step to do an adoption is to do our Adoption Application here: https://www.elmorehumane.org/adoption-application-online-form2.html\n\nIMPORTANT - we respond to your emailed applications and queries via email back to you. Please make sure you have either added our email (hselco@bellsouth.net) to your contact list or that you routinely check your SPAM folder for our response just to be safe. If we do not receive a timely response we simply move on to another applicant.\nYes, there are sometimes exceptions to our normal fee for older dogs or special cases. Some of our pets have also been lovingly sponsored by caring people and we will let the approved adopter know about that at the point of adoption. Visit our Website at: http://www.elmorehumane.org The staff would also like to remind you that for faster response to inquiries about adoptable animals to have the animals ID#, name & description. This way your questions will be answered in a timely manner.\nAll pet adoption websites & our shelter management software require that we choose a primary and/or secondary breed for our dogs. While our staff is quite breed knowledgeable, in many cases we are truly making our best guesses as to their breed(s) based on many factors but cannot promise that what we have said is accurate. So taking into account your own parameters for things such as size, coat care, activity level, etc please come and get to know our dog(s) as individuals to see if their personalities and yours are a forever match.\nPhone: (334) 567-3377 Fax: (334) 567-8774 E-mail: hselco@bellsouth.net",

I arrived very thin and I had a broken bone going to my hip but I had surgery and am all better. I am just a puppy, about 10 months old and I am now 45 lbs and still filling out. I like women but that's because of my foster mom, I am scared of kids but I like dogs and respect dogs that are smaller than me too. I like the beach and am walking nicely on a leash. I need a family who has time to love me and work with me on training? I am a super smart boy. I bark when I hear noises because I am a natural protector. My name is Braxton, who's ready for me?

As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals or how large puppies will be when fully grown.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our 'Visit' page for hours and directions to our shelter.

I'm a wise older man who is set in his ways and knows what he wants in life. Those things include a plethora of food and toys. The things I am not big on include being touched and sharing. Like I said, I know what I want in life and would much prefer to have it all to myself. I might, however, be willing to share a space with another canine companion. I most definitely need an owner who has some dog experience. I don't kiss on the first date but I am looking to settle down. I'm looking for a quiet adult household with no children that understands my needs, and doesn't push me too quickly.",

He has no teeth, so soft food is preferred but he will eat small dry food.

He is dog selective which means like some dogs but not others based on personality and energy level. McLovin is a laid back guy that likes to chill out around the home or office and go for an occasional walk or hike. He is on the smaller side about 45-50lbs and fits in an averaged sized lap. He would be a good fit for active senior humans who are looking for a lad back well behaved personality. McLovin doesn't really like being left alone but he tolerates it. So someone retired or working from home would be ideal. He rides well in the car. He has not been cat tested at this time but can be introduced to the resident calm senior cat on premise, at a request with an approved application. If you would like to sponsor or adopt a U.C.C dog in need please visit www.ulstercountycanines.com for an adoption application or ways to donate.\nDont forget to follow and like us on facebook https://www.facebook.com/UlsterCountyCanines845\n\nPlease fill out an application to begin communication. Inquiries through pet finder will not be responded to. Apps only. I simply cannot answer to \"how much?\" or \"how much weighs?\" Or \"tell me more about? 100s of times if you do not meet our adoption criteria to begin with. Thanks for understanding send me those apps!!!!!",

She is a bed hog / couch hog for real!\n\nShe loves to play, and she plays hard! She can shred toys like an industrial shredder. Kong is best for her, for sure.\n\nShe LOVES her foster brother Copper and would do great with a dog brother . I do not know how she is around cats, as we don't have any.\n\nShe does not have any idea how fast or heavy she is. She runs full force and with much joy towards what she wants to see! She is learning to slow down and to give more space to people she meets, however she also doesn't have a clue what personal space is. She loves kids, but gets right up close and personal, sometimes knocking them over. We are working on that as well.\n\nShe has learned to sit, lay down and shake since we brought her home. She is VERY smart and can escape a kennel if its not closed properly.\n\nWe are working on walking on a leash and stay.\n\nShe is investigative and likes to look on the counters. She has only retrieved a wooden spoon to chew on and a bagel.\n\nShe loves belly rubs and head pats and kisses. She is also a TALKER!! She does not like to be ignored. She will let you know that she desires you attention by starting with a small sigh and get louder until you talk to her. \n\nShe is fantastic! Would do great with an active family. She often plays in the house by herself for entertainment.",

I was running along some roads, and apparently, that\u2019s not very safe! I found a great human to call my own, but unfortunately it didn\u2019t work out. I quickly found another family to start a new life with, and I loved them very much, but I\u2019m a jealous girl. I want to be the only sparkle in your eye. That\u2019s definitely a good thing, I want a serious relationship with full commitment! I need a home without kids, they are a bit scary to me!!  I know the perfect match for me is out there, I just need to find you! Come visit me today and I\u2019ll prove I\u2019m enough to make your life complete!",

Kobe is highly intelligent and trainable. He needs to be the only dog in the house as he is dog selective and likes who he likes. He loves to lead an active lifestyle, so a backyard is ideal and a family who is active. Kobe is very protective of his family and very loyal to those he loves. He also enjoys long walks and needs a little leash training with his dog selective behavior. In the house, Kobe is house trained and loves playing with his toys and bones! Please give this sweet boy a chance to lounge in your house and play in your yard with you! \n\nIf interested in adopting Kobe, kindly fill out the application found here:  \n\nhttps://www.ozzieandfriendsrescue.org/adoptions\n\nIn filling out this adoption application, I understand that Ozzie and Friends Rescue cannot guarantee that the dog applied for is yours to adopt upon completion of application. \n\nWe also want to disclaim that all dogs are rescued so we cannot 100% know the exact breed.",

I am quite shy with new people but once I get to know you, I love to roll over for tummy rubs and I like to curl up next to you in bed. I will definitely need to be in a home with another dog that will be my buddy. I am very attached to my foster brother, Sky, and I learn a lot about how to dog from him. I didn't have much socialization when I was younger and my foster mom has been working on that with me. She says I am leaps and bounds more confident than I used to be but she also says I will need a special person to understand my quirky personality. I like to chew and can't be left unattended for long periods of time but I do enjoy my crate when my foster mom goes to work if you put a nice chew toy in there with me. I do pretty well going potty outside but I do occassionaly have an accident in the house. As long as I'm on a pretty consistant routine, I do well. I'm a silly, sweet, special girl and I can't wait to find my furever home!",

            "description": "KENT is a 2-3 year old #islandterrier from St Croix who has a really sad story, at no fault of his own. He was originally adopted by a family as a puppy, and then returned at a year old because he was \"too big.\" In January Kent was adopted again, but sadly has been returned again due to unforeseen circumstances in which his adopter was unable to continue caring for him. Kent is playful and loving. He loves to take walks, but is easily triggered by the sights and sounds of his environment. He can be nervous with new people and needs a very calm and patient introduction. He is not suited for urban life, and would do best in a quiet home with a fenced-in yard and no kids or other animals. Kent is currently with our trainer in Ohio working on gaining confidence and general obedience. When his professional training is complete he will need someone who will continue his training and provide him with the stability, patience and love that he so deserves after all he's been through.",

            "description": "It's \"Mr. Steal Your Girl\", Jerry! \n\nAfter running from Animal Control for 3 days, Jerry finally made his way to Underdogs with badly burned paw pads, lots of scaries, and struggling to understand he was truly safe. Though Jerry is BIG on showing love to his current foster family, he's been very slow to open up and show us his full personality. He is a true \"velcro dog\", wanting to make sure he knows where everyone is all the time and is a very close talker (which is probably so he's at the ready when he wants to give kisses - which is always). \n\nAt 4 years old and 75lbs, Jerry thinks himself of a lap dog and has been working hard on training at his foster house. He's mastered \"sit\", loves the dog door, and is just figuring out how to curb his next level excitement when he thinks it's time to go for a walk or ride. Jerry would do best in a home with older children, mostly since he just doesn't know his size, but will offer up his belly to just about anyone he meets. \n\nJerry is absolute perfection and is working hard on some reactivity with other dogs (cats are a \"no go\" for this sweet boy) - while not all other dogs are his favorite, he absolutely adores his foster sister so it just needs to be the right fit with a lower energy, confident dog. He showers his foster sister with kisses, cuddles and is happy to accompany her when she gets the zoomies - the boy just loves to love! \n\nJerry would benefit from a compassionate owner, dedicated to continuing with force-free training to help him gain confidence and feel more secure in his home environment. He's a pretty snoozy hippo who isn't bothered if he doesn't have a ton of physical activity, enjoying daily walks which lead to big naps, being mostly happy with pets from his humans and sunbathing like the Adonis that he is.\n\nJerry is neutered, up-to-date on basic vaccinations and microchipped. Our Underdogs adult dog adoption fee is $300, which includes spay/neuter, microchip, and up-to-date vaccinations. \n\nIf you're interested in adopting Jerry, please fill out an adoption application here: https://underdogsrescue.org/adopt-form/\n\nUnderdogs is a small volunteer-based animal rescue and we unfortunately do not have the resources to respond to phone and email inquires about our adoptable animals at this time. If you're interested in learning more or setting up a meeting with one of our animals, please complete an adoption application first. It may take up to two weeks for application review and one of our coordinators will reach out to you as soon as we are through the intitial review process. We appreciate your patience and understanding! Thank you!",

            "description": "Danny came to us after his owner sadly passed away, leaving he and his 3 canine siblings (who are with other rescues) to fend for thenselves. Understandably, Danny is a bit unsure of new people and new places, but he is coming along well. He LOVES to play with other dogs and listens very well, but will duck away a little when you try to pet him. His foster is working hard to help him learn that people can be kind and belly rubs are the best!\n\n**This dog is heartworm positive and will be treated by the rescue and will be available for foster to adopt for a local to Charleston, SC family that is comfortable with the activity restriction requirements for the duration of treatment.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please fill out an application. We do allow out of state adoptions and any transport costs are at the expense of the adopter. If you have further questions about this dog, please email us at ccradopt@gmail.com and someone will be in touch as soon as possible. Please note we are unable to hold dogs for adopters as this ties up valuable foster homes.\n\nPlease understand that we are an all volunteer group and we have jobs outside of this organization. We do our best to provide quick responses but occasionally they are a little slower. If you do not receive a response in 48 hours, please resend to make sure it's received.",

She is affectionate and enjoys being with people. Also, Luna is well-behaved \u2013 she is housetrained, responds to commands, takes treats gently and knows \u201csit\u201d and \u201cpaw\u201d. Luna has a medium energy level; she will rest when inside and self-entertain with her toys, yet she thoroughly enjoys a game of fetch and will allow the toy to be taken out of her mouth.\nIn the yard, Luna will chase squirrels and birds. Luna walks well on leash, but she will pull towards a squirrel or rabbit if she sees one; she responds well to correction. Luna will bark at passersby from behind a fence, yet she quickly gets used to neighboring people and dogs and does not bark at them.\nLuna has a youthful and upbeat spirit. Luna's forever family will be so happy to have such a loving dog.\"",

Love a set of electric drums, or perhaps you live next to the biggest fireworks display of the year? Not the ideal home setting for most dogs but if you're also the loudest snorer you know, not only will Piglet not mind - he will challenge you for the title! \n\nPiglet is deaf. But that's not his only superpower. He is also blessed with the ability to read faces, understand hand signals and has a super-canine powered sniffer that can detect a hot dog at 100 meters. His 'drop and wiggle' move for human cuddles is unrivalled although he doesn't always appreciate, that at 90lbs, he's not the ideal lap dog.\n \nPiglet has a lot in common with his namesake character from the 100 acre wood. A heart the size of a lion, the most loyal and loving friend , he can rock a green striped sweater and is always willing to just sit with you and contemplate the finer things in life.\n\nHe needs a calm, adult only home without children as he can be easily startled and when excited becomes a well-intentioned wrecking ball! Despite his sweet nature, he needs an experienced dog owner who can continue to help him blossom into the best possible version of himself and make sure he meets new people slowly to build his trust. Taking Piglet home will have to be a gradual process so we are looking for a special person that is open and willing to invest the time needed to get to know and understand him before transitioning to a new home. \n\nHe walks great on leash and has does well with other dogs out on walks and in playgroup. \n\nPiglets quirks are also his most endearing qualities. In the words of the original Piglet, 'The things that make me different are the things that make me, me'!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Piglet, email kat.sanders@lostdogrescue.org\n\nSponsored by Tucker and Ruby",

He is 30 pounds, and his underbite is a full inch! He loves to swim, fetch, and play with toys and friends. He is very rambunctious at playtime, but is a big snuggler once he settles down. He is good with other dogs, but will only be adopted to a home with a larger dog, and no cats. He is friendly with small dogs and cats, but accidentally injured a small dog trying to play, so he should not be unattended with smaller animals. He loves kids, and would love a home with a large playful dog and a fenced yard. Adopt Cousin! You will never stop laughing!",

He and his sister Star are playful but still a bit cautious of humans. But they allow us to touch both of them. Bolt is a fast boy and likes to sneak out behind you when opening and closing doors and gates. We think it is a game for him because he does not go anywhere. With training, Bolt will be an excellent companion for outdoor activities and snuggling on the couch. He likes to sleep in his crate.

He is very affectionate and really loves his humans. He has excellent recall and listens well. He sometimes will attempt to \"punch\" a dog away from his human. If you tell him No before he does it he breaks off and does not \"punch\". With more reinforcement, this behavior should wane.\n\nHe needs an experienced dog family since he is so active. He gets along with most all adult large dogs. He is NOT GOOD with small dogs, puppies or cats. We think he will do well with one other dog who is tolerant of his adolescent antics.\n\nHe will make a great companion for a family or single person. Please think about saving Buddy as he has been here almost a year now. He is a really good boy and is loved by all who meet him.\n\nNote: He may (or may not) but most likely will, knock over small children.\n\nHe really likes his crate and laying on the couch and bed snuggling with his human.\n\nAll dogs and puppies are fully wormed, receive rabies and core vaccinations, microchipped, behavior assessed with other dogs and humans (sorry, no cat testing is done here), spend a minimum of 3 weeks free-ranging within a pack of 30 dogs to grow confidence and trust and may have DNA results. All dogs receive lifetime behavior support and can be returned anytime without a fee. \n\nPLEASE NOTE: You MUST complete an adoption application in order to see or adopt a dog from us.

She is adorable to watch, good with other dogs, and like any other senior, at times she likes to be left alone relaxing in her bed. That said, she does like to cuddle at the right time!\n\nShe will soon be getting dental work as her teeth were not taken care of at all. She is looking for the perfect home where she can be loved and have the life she deserves.  We do not know how good or not she might be with children but can assume she would prefer a quite family. \n\nTO ADOPT Nona, visit us at www.resqmedogmission.org to fill out an adoption application. You can also call us at 305.970.5970 should you have questions about this lady's character.",

She is still nervous around new people. But, once she gets to know you, she loves to be loved on about as much as she loves other dogs. \n\nWe recommend a home with a male dog, as she tends to really favor hanging out with larger male dogs.  At only 1 year old and 29lbs, we feel like she is going to be a great addition to a home with someone willing to be patient for a bit. She is incredibly playful and full of life. She just needs a little time to show it. \nWant to foster or adopt this gorgeous girl?  Visit CaneRossoRescue.org to apply.\n\nThanks for considering a Cane Rosso Rescue dog! \nWe place dogs mostly in Texas but have adopted out a few out-of-state as well.\n \nIf you are interested in one of our dogs, please first complete our adoption application.\nYou can find it at https://www.canerossorescue.org/adoption-application . Her adoption fee is $300 plus tax. Our dogs are spayed or neutered, microchipped, vaccinated and heartworm tested and treated (if tested positive) before going to a new home. For more information, visit our website www.canerossorescue.org\nor email us at rescue@canerosso.com.",

I\u2019m a sweet boy and THE BEST personal assistant you will ever find!  I love car rides and a champ at running errands \u2013 Home Depot is my favorite stop!  I enjoy leisurely walks, love squeaky toys and a game of tug.  Smart, too!   I know sit, down, shake, and touch.  I\u2019m housebroken and good in the bath.  I\u2019m in decent shape for an older gentleman \u2013 take supplements for my kidneys, CBD for the old joints, and regular baths keep my skin/coat in shape!  I\u2019m okay w/ other dogs but not really interested in finding a doggy friend.  Cats?  No thanks!  I REALLY want a PERSON to call my own!  If you\u2019re in the market for the buddy of a lifetime then please, please consider me! \nWanna meet me?  Contact my foster Mom, Diane, at dk1enzo@cox.net or 310.507.3341.",

She finds the shelter to be stressful and because she is sensitive, she's ready to be anywhere else. Moira may do better wearing a harness, she tries to play magic tricks and Houdini herself out of regular collars! She knows basic commands and has pretty good house manners. Karla will need lots of patience when she first meets people, but once she trusts you she will roll over to allow lots of belly rubs! It would be a plus (and a great bonding experience) if you can work with a trainer on leash reactivity during walks. She gets anxious being left alone, so someone that is home a lot would be the best match for her. Moira would prefer to be the only dog to get all the attention in her new home. No apartments please. Due to her anxiety and reported behavior, we would prefer Karla to go to a home with no kids under 10.",

Only where our volunteers do home visits; if you live outside of our adoption area, thank you for wanting to adopt a rescue dog but please visit your local shelters, rescues and SPCA's. \n\nTommy is a very handsome 2 to 3 year old love bug of a boy who loves running in his fenced foster mom's yard and gets along with other dogs but would do best with dogs his size because of his playfulness. Tommy is up for any adventure you might want to take him on and he is house trained and crate trained and ready to find a family of his own to love. Imagine having a fur legged furry child who loves you unconditionally and who would love to end the day cuddling on the couch together. He needs a little training to walk on a leash without pulling but he is so eager to please I know he will master this quickly.",

            "description": "Chester is about 10 months old, came to us from an overcrowding situation and has done great in his foster home.  He has a nice balance of energy\u2014overall pretty mellow, but has a playful side.  Chester is very athletic, smart,  and easy to train, so will do well with an adopter who is active and enjoys walks/hikes/exploring outdoors.   We don't know his breed mix for sure, but based on body type and temperament we are thinking hound/lab/greyhound?  Chester is housebroken, great with other dogs, very sweet. He\u2019s not a barker, but he loves to \u201ctalk.\u201d  Puppies require a lot of time and attention, so we only consider adopters who are at least 25 years old and have an adult at home all or most of the time.   Adoption fee is $350. Please complete an application and be sure to tell your vet that we will be contacting them. Thank you for choosing to adopt a rescue dog!\nFor more photos and  information about Angels in Waiting Rescue, please like  us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/pages/Angels-In-Waiting-Rescue/182252038497075",

Only where our volunteers do home visits; if you live outside of our adoption area, thank you for wanting to adopt a rescue dog but please visit your local shelters, rescues and SPCA's. \n\nRandy, a 2 to 3 year old, boxer/shepherd mix, shows his gratitude for being rescued from the streets of Georgia by giving his foster mom lots of kisses. He is such a different dog than he was when he first arrived from Georgia on July 26th. Randy enjoys showing his foster mom his belly just to get belly rubs & has fun with the resident dogs (both small & large). He is most happy tearing it up in his foster mom\u2019s fenced in backyard. After spending time in his crate, he has tons of energy that he needs to burn off. He would rather be exploring trails & neighborhoods, but running around in the backyard suits him just fine. He is crate trained and house trained. Please consider adopting this handsome young lad.",

He is pretty independent, he plays by himself and prefers to do his own thing. He is potty trained and likes to play with squeaky toys.  He needs an experienced owner who can work with him on his behavioral issues. He thinks he is much bigger than he really is! Because of these issues, he would do best in a home without kids. He is located at the Apollo Rescue Center.\n\n\nIncluded with adoption: Age-appropriate vaccinations, up to date heart-worm preventative, heart-worm test if over 6 months, insurance for 30 days, microchip with registration, and spayed or neutered- if not already, a voucher is provided. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please complete our Pre-application: https://form.jotform.us/asr628/ShortAdoptionInquiry",

            "description": "Chulo spent 2 months in the Wichita Animal Shelter. We inquired about the incident that led to his incarceration at the city shelter. Apparently he has gotten loose a few times and this time he scratched an older woman on the leg that led to him being impounded and deemed a potentially dangerous dog. His owner was unable to comply with the pen requirements due to landlord issues and could not reclaim . Sadly this is why Chulo has been kept locked up since August. We were never made aware of his situation until the emergency email October 12th when we were contacted that there was an injury to his tail that had just occurred and that he was aggressive with staff and would require a catch pole to remove from the kennel for vet care. We were sent a video from rescue coordinator and we did NOT see a dog that was described as aggressive with staff that couldn't be removed from a kennel. We saw a sweet boy that was happy to follow commands for a kind word or treat. As a result we were able to go rescue this boy and get the tail issue checked out. There were no issues with leashing him up. He was not reactive to any of the other dogs, people or animal control officers he passed by and sweet as could be with the vet staff too. The Dr examined the tail which did not bother him at all and determined that this was probably just an old injury that had healed a long time ago.....",

            "description": "Hello potential new family, my name is Blake! I'm a 2 year old male Australian Cattle Dog (blue heeler) mix and I weigh 60 pounds. True to my breed I am extremely loyal to my owners but wary of strangers at first so I'm a bit anxious and vocal when it comes to meeting new people. In order to improve my socialization skills I will need a strong leader who is willing to give me a lot of time, effort and patience. I could use some obedience training. I am a very strong dude and could use some work on leash manners. I am a HIGH energy pup so I need lots of exercise and I'm very smart and very treat motivated so I'm easy to train. I'm a great running partner - I go running with my foster mom and dad. They usually wear me out around 5 miles. I am potty trained and crate trained - I crate up easily when asked. I'm a little obsessed with car rides - they're kinda my favorite! I love running and playing with my furry foster siblings (all dogs - unknown with cats)! I've named myself captain of the \"squirrel patrol\" and enjoy chasing squirrels and watching them play in the backyard tree. I have not been observed around children, though once I've gotten to know and trust them I bet we'd be best friends! I can be easily excited into some hilarious zoomies. I'm a huge goofball and I keep my foster humans laughing constantly. If you start dancing I can't help but to join in - I'll even hold onto your hips with my paws. I give THE BEST hugs!! Most of all I enjoy being near my human and being loved on - I am so incredibly lovable and loyal. Finding a home with Australian cattle dog experience would be a plus, but obviously doesn't rule you out from being able to enjoy all the fun and love I have to offer! \nIf you would like to meet me, fill out an application and the Bella staff will arrange it.",

The adopter is the alpha member of the pack, and the dog or puppy needs as much one-on-one contact with the alpha as possible. For this reason, all Route 66 Rescue Inc. dogs are adopted to inside homes only. They must be on leash, or inside a secure fence when outside, and not left outside alone when no one is home. Invisible fencing does not qualify as protection since other animals and strangers have access to the dog. The dogs must be returned to Route 66 Rescue, Inc. if ever given up by the adopter. Thank you for understanding we want only the best for the dogs you give a forever home.\n\nSadie is a blonde and white mixed bred girl.  Her birthday is estimated to be around 11/03/2016, and on 11/03/2020, she weighed 43.6 lbs.  Sadie takes a while to get acquainted, and has the appearances of a dog that has not had good experiences with the people she has been around.  She hasn't learned to trust and will need a forever family who will take the time to show her what a loving family is.  She will be adopted to an adult forever family .\n \nPlease complete and return the adoption application to meet any of our adoptable dogs.\nhttp://www.route66rescueinc.com/adoption-application.html Thank you for visiting our site.

            "description": "Lucky Beagle!Kane was born around November 11, 2012 and weighs about 20 pounds. Kane was found roaming the streets of Buffalo and was picked up by a good samaritan who contacted both the local dog control officer and SPCA. When no one claimed Kane she brought him to JR as she was unable to afford the dental care that was needed. Kane arrived with a mouth full of infection, unaltered, and extremely skinny. After his neuter and dental, which resulted in 20 teeth needing to be pulled, Kane is like a shiny new penny and ready for a wonderful life! We want to mention that his teeth were SO bad that there may be more dental work needed in the not so distant future. Kane must have a fenced because his nose will get in him trouble. Kane rides well in the car and is fine with the other dogs, cats, and kids, and loves to snuggle! We have found that he is not going to do well in an apartment type setting as he does have that Beagle sound that real Beagle humans love! Also, maybe due to the dental disease that we are struggling to find what he wants to eat. He won't touch canned food which is very odd, but has been dining on hard boiled eggs, those cheap peanut butter and cheese crackers......Asian type noodles and hard dog biscuits......he is very confusing and we'll keep trying things. Update: Christmas 2020 seems to be no exception to bad news throughout the year. Kane is in liver failure and we are keeping him comfortable until it is time to let him go. We are very sad - he is SO sweet!!! The Adoption Fee for this dog is n/a\nAdoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a 'complete' pet.

Although I do well with both, I'm very timid and do take some time to warm up. The staff at the previous shelter believe I may have been abused in my previous home, which would explain why I have a hard time trusting people. My ideal home has children at least 12 and older, who understand I need time to get used to them, I also seem to do better with women. I am microchipped, 4DX tested (all negative), spayed, and up to date on vaccinations. Do you think you have the perfect calm home for me?

I was surrendered due to my owner passing away, so no fault of my own. I am an easy going senior lady who loves attention looking for a calm place to live out my golden years, preferably as the only pet and only older children. I'm spayed, up to date on vaccinations, microchipped and 4DX tested (Lyme positive, but currently showing no signs or symptoms. Should they flare up I would require a re-test and most likely a 30 day course of treatment which isn't very expensive). The Humane Society of Warren County is running by appointment only with approved applications. If you are interested in adopting, the first step is submitting an application which can be found on our shelter website. Once approved, you would be invited out to come and visit. www.humanesocietywarrencounty.comInterested in adopting?

I have two short arms, am kinda scaly, and had a starring role in Spielberg\u2019s Jurr- JUST KIDDING. I\u2019m actually a 3 y/o, male, shepard pit/lab mix who tips the scales at a mean 60lbs. I was brought way of The Cantu Foundation when my owner left me behind after he moved out. Pretty rude, right? As you can probably gather, he wasn\u2019t the best owner, so I\u2019m only semi potty trained. Don\u2019t worry though\u2014I\u2019m a quick study and make up for it in the leash department! I\u2019m a big guy who doesn\u2019t pull. Practically a dreamboat, right?\n\u00a0\nBefore I got to my current comfy digs, I was found malnourished and covered in mange. I had been living on the streets and spent my days hunting for scraps while trying not to get hit by those dangerous people-movers (Think you call them cars?). Anyways, I\u2019m a loyal guy who just wants to be emotionally tethered to a human. Specifically, a human who loves and cares about me. Because of my past, I\u2019m still learning how to adjust to life in the burbs. Sometimes I let my anxiety get the best of me and lack the confidence needed to be a regular dog. But that\u2019s where YOU come in! Just be kind and patient with me while I decompress and get acclimated. It won\u2019t take long before I\u2019ll feel confident that I\u2019m safe!\n\u00a0\nSo you may be asking yourself, \u2018How does Rex do around other dogs?\u2019 Well you asked the right pupper! I like small and large doggos even hyper ones, I know how to match their energy. Sometimes they get all up in your business and it can bug, okay? Cats, however, I\u2019m not sure about. Never met one, but I loved the movie despite those Rotten Tomato reviews! Kids I do okay with, but older is better. I\u2019d lump younger kids in the younger doggos category\u2014all up in my business!\n\u00a0\nNow that you know what a catch I am, let\u2019s talk about the areas where I can improve. I have a tad bit of separation anxiety. I was abandoned once, remember? My foster dad says it isn\u2019t so bad though, because I make up for it in the lovable, snuggle-buddy, and people-pleasing categories. Since I\u2019ve lived most of my life in streets, I still have yet to master the stairs but don\u2019t worry I can walk up a flight of stairs on my own now! \n\u00a0\nI would flourish in a home with another doggo friend, I will also do well in a home with small humans (7 years old and up) My paws are crossed that I end up with a family who will be patient and train me so I can be the best doggo this side of Mexico. My adoption fee is $400, which includes spaying/neutering and vetting care.

She enjoys spending time with other dogs in our exercise areas.  \n\nLula Bell is a cute Jack Russell Terrier mix!  She weighs 27 pounds. \n\nAre you that special someone who can give Lula Bell the home she dreams of?\n\nAll of our dogs are spayed or neutered and are current on all vaccinations. They are on monthly heartworm and flea/tick prevention. All of their medical needs are taken care of before they are available for adoption. Our adoption fee is only $100.00. Please complete an application, if you have found a dog you are interested in adopting. You can find our application at www.horsecreekwildlife.org/applic.html. Once completed, you can forward it to adoptions@horsecreekwildlife.org or fax it to 731-926-3000. Kim Austin, our adoption facilitator, will be in contact with you as soon as she has an opportunity to review your application. Understand that she has other duties and she will not ignore any interest shown in adopting one of our dogs. An application will need to be approved before a scheduled time to visit our dogs will be set up.  It may take up to 48 hours before she returns your call or responds to your email, due to work schedules, holidays and adoption events. We do the very best we can for the dogs we have rescued and do not take the adoption process lightly. Please be patient and understand that we will place our rescued dogs in the very best homes possible and reserve the right to refuse applications.",

She enjoys spending time in the exercise areas with other dogs. \n\nWe believe Xita may be a Beagle mix.  She is full-grown and weighs 35 pounds.  \n\nThis sweet girl is patiently waiting for her forever home.  Xita would love to complete your life! \n\nAll of our dogs are spayed or neutered and are current on all vaccinations. They are on monthly heartworm and flea/tick prevention. All of their medical needs are taken care of before they are available for adoption. Our adoption fee is only $100.00. Please complete an application, if you have found a dog you are interested in adopting. You can find our application at www.horsecreekwildlife.org/applic.html. Once completed, you can forward it to adoptions@horsecreekwildlife.org or fax it to 731-926-3000. Kim Austin, our adoption facilitator, will be in contact with you as soon as she has an opportunity to review your application. Understand that she has other duties and she will not ignore any interest shown in adopting one of our dogs. An application will need to be approved before a scheduled time to visit our dogs will be set up.  It may take up to 48 hours before she returns your call or responds to your email, due to work schedules, holidays and adoption events. We do the very best we can for the dogs we have rescued and do not take the adoption process lightly. Please be patient and understand that we will place our rescued dogs in the very best homes possible and reserve the right to refuse applications.",

She is the best momma dog!\n\nShe is an energetic and loving lady who seems to be enjoying every moment of her life.  She likes playing outside with other dogs and loves receiving affection from people.\n\nDaisy is full-grown and weighs 18 pounds.  We believe she is a Terrier/Feist mix.  \n\nDo you have room in your home, heart and life for this lovebug? Daisy will bring you lots of joy, if you give her a chance!  \n\nAll of our dogs are spayed or neutered and are current on all vaccinations. They are on monthly heartworm and flea/tick prevention. All of their medical needs are taken care of before they are available for adoption. Our adoption fee is only $100.00. Please complete an application, if you have found a dog you are interested in adopting. You can find our application at www.horsecreekwildlife.org/applic.html. Once completed, you can forward it to adoptions@horsecreekwildlife.org or fax it to 731-926-3000. Kim Austin, our adoption facilitator, will be in contact with you as soon as she has an opportunity to review your application. Understand that she has other duties and she will not ignore any interest shown in adopting one of our dogs. An application will need to be approved before a scheduled time to visit our dogs will be set up.  It may take up to 48 hours before she returns your call or responds to your email, due to work schedules, holidays and adoption events. We do the very best we can for the dogs we have rescued and do not take the adoption process lightly. Please be patient and understand that we will place our rescued dogs in the very best homes possible and reserve the right to refuse applications.",

She adores being right next to her people! She\u2019s a very loving gentle giant. \nBennie is good with kids 8 and older. She is still a puppy at heart and doesn\u2019t yet realize her size. This sweet girl is crate trained, knows sit but does need other basics and leash work. She is fully vetted, vaccinated and microchipped.\n\nWe will require Bennie to be in training within 30 days of adoption. Basic obedience training is very important and a great opportunity for Bennie to learn new commands, reinforce good manners and bond with her forever family.\n\nFor more information about our adoption process and an application please visit www.whitekissesgreatdanerescue.com/adopt",

I need someone who is experienced and has patience. I need a secured yard with a higher than 5 1/2 foot fence. I am a typical husky that is very athletic. I would need a proper introduction to a dog first. Once i warm up to you, i am a very sweet and playful girl.",

            "description": "Hi I'm Jackson and I'm a year old, neutered male Cur Mix weighing about 45 lbs. \n\nI am a spunky guy who likes to enjoy life.  \n\nI know my basic commands and am working on consistently doing as I\u2019m told.  Sometimes I\u2019m just so excited, I forget to do what\u2019s said to me.  When I\u2019m reminded, I can sit, come, stay like a champ.  I'm very food motivated so the snacky snacks help me to focus on what is expected of me.  \n\nI go potty outside when I am kept on a schedule.  I don\u2019t know how to show my foster family that I need to go out yet.  \n\nI'm good with other dogs, kids, I\u2019ve met a cat, and even live with hamsters! I watch them with curious puppy eyes but I do not try to get into their cage. \n\nI\u2019m learning to keep four on the floor. But frankly, I really like people and sometimes my excitement gets the best of me so I jump to say hello. \n\nI have developed a comfort in my crate although I would much rather hang with the family.  Some snacky snacks in my crate make it a much happier place. \n\nI have fabulous new and improved leash walking skills! I\u2019d love a family who is active to take me out and about to burn my energy and see the site of my new hometown which would give me opportunity to show off what a good boy I am when we go out. \n\nIf you happen to need a fun loving playful guy to be your new BFF, I\u2019m taking applications and just in time to be your Valentine!\n\nIf you would like to be considered as a potential adopter for one of our great dogs, please go to our website-?www.luckymuttsrescue.org?and submit an application. Our application process includes landlord approval and vet checks. Please make sure all of your information is current and accurate, including a valid email address and phone numbers. Inaccuracies and/or incomplete data will delay and/or cancel your application. We strive to process all applications in a timely manner, but with the high volume of applications we are receiving, it is taking anywhere from 1-3 weeks.  You may be contacted via email if there are concerns or questions.  Once all of your information is reviewed and if your application is approved, you will be notified via email.  Submitting an application and receiving an approval does not guarantee you will be adopting the dog you applied for.  Once you move to the meet and greet process, you will be contacted by the foster family to further discuss the dog, and answer questions you may have, and if applicable, a meet and greet will be set up at our adoption center.   Meet and greets are only set up with approved applicants, and we require all members in the household to be present, as well as any current dogs in the home. \nCurrent Adoption Fees Are:$400+tax for puppies to 3 years old\n$350+tax for ages 4-7\n$250+tax for ages 8 and up\nBonded pairs vary\nThe adoption fee covers spay/neuter, up to date age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, general deworming, heartworm test, (if over 6  months) and a certified veterinary inspection. Please be aware, listed dog breeds are based on information provided and cannot be guaranteed.  Submitting an application for a particular dog does not guarantee that you will be the applicant chosen, we receive several applications for each dog. Our adopters are picked based on the needs of the dog, and the home we feel with best fit based on your responses to our application, vet information and landlord requirements.   Approved applicants not chosen for the dog you applied for, will be in active status for a period of six months.  We encourage you to watch Petfinder, Facebook and our website for upcoming dogs.  Should you see a dog that interests you,please send us a Facebook message or an email with your approval number.  Please be patient with us, as Lucky Mutts Rescue is run strictly by volunteers and many of us work full time jobs, have families and also foster dogs. Thank you for considering Lucky Mutts Rescue for your next furry family member!",

I was rescued from a high-volume shelter where it was so stressful for me since I'm hearing impaired.  Now that I'm in foster care, it is so much better and I've been to doggy school and have learned hand signals - hey, I said I was smart!  I do well with dogs of all sizes, I'm even mellow around my bossy foster brother.  I'm good with kids old enough to understand my special needs.    I am quickly learning about being in a house and looking for that family that will continue with loving and gentle training to become the perfect gentleman.  I do well on a leash and hope long walks are in my future.  I'm friendly with people, love being with my person and playing with toys or sticks. If you are looking for a sweet happy boy to be your best bud, I'm your guy!  If you are interested in me, please send an email to scpdogworld@gmail.com to get more information on how to fill out an application and have a great meet and greet to see if we are a match made in heaven.\n\nAdopter for this dog must reside in the immediate Houston/Galveston area and be at least 25 years old.  A home visit may be required prior to this dog going to any home. The adoption fee for a dog is $190 (or $245 for puppies) which includes State of Texas sales tax. All dogs are microchipped, on heartworm protection, spayed/neutered, vaccinated, de-wormed and treated for fleas.",

She had never known love in her 3 years of life, but instead was used for puppies. She was so very grateful to the volunteer that found her that day, and happily accepted the hose he had to use to wash the ants off of her poor painful body, and she melted right into his arms to be loaded into a vehicle and taken to safety. She had so many ant bites her hair had already fallen out in patches, and more would be lost before she could be healed. She was loaded with intestinal parasites, and of course heartworm positive. Butttt....look at his beautiful girl now. All of her beautiful coat has filled back in, she\u2019s been treated for the Intestinal parasites, fully vaccinated, spayed, microchipped, and is currently on slow-kill treatment for her heartworms and is doing great. This amazing girl is so full of love for her people and other dogs, even though she has no reason to trust or love after the way she was neglected. She\u2019s loving her life as a family member in her foster home, and she will crate, but she doesn\u2019t like it too much. We can\u2019t blame her since it represents a little of how she lived before she was rescued. Sally is a sweet and loving girl who is ready to find her very own family and live her happily ever after. And we can\u2019t think of a single rescue that deserves it more than this amazing girl!!",

            "description": "Hey there, I'm Mojo! A spunky senior pup ready to take your breath away with my dashing good looks and festive holiday spirit. I'm a very sweet and lovable boy! I was rescued with my mom (Chewie) and my 4 siblings (Pudgy, Tater, Twoie, and Tiri), and we are all up for adoption. I can be adopted by myself or into a house with another dog. Or, if you are looking to add multiple dogs to your home, I can be adopted with another pup in my family (the more the merrier, right?). My brother Tater is the silliest one of the bunch, but I take second place I think - I love to do the 'downward dog' stretch and prance around in my adorable sweaters. You would never know I'm a senior - I'm not high energy but I still have pep in my step. I enjoy a leisurely walk around the neighborhood, hanging out with other dogs, and then heading in to cuddle up in my bed for a nap. I love peanut butter Kongs and trying any new treat - I take them gently from your hand too. I'm easygoing, friendly with people and dogs, and, like my name Mojo suggests, am just a really cool dog. I cannot wait to find my forever home, so ask ARNO about meeting me today!\n\n\nMy adoption fee is $200. This includes a spay/neuter, up-to-date vaccines, deworming, a microchip, a heartworm test, and, if needed, heartworm treatment.\n\n________________________________________________\n\nFor all animals that have not been spayed or neutered a $100 deposit will be required in addition to the adoption fee. The deposit is refundable upon completion of the spay / neuter surgery.\n\nFor more information email: adopt@animalrescueneworleans.org.\n\nTo complete an application, please visit: https://animalrescueneworleans.org/adoptfoster/.\n\nPlease visit our facebook for more information about adoption specials, and adoption events. Events are a great way to meet multiple animals at a time!\n\n________________________________________________\n\nFor all animals that have not been spayed or neutered a $100 deposit will be required in addition to the adoption fee.

I was rescued with my mom (Chewie) and my 4 siblings (Mojo, Tater, Twoie, and Tiri), and we are all up for adoption. I can be adopted by myself or into a house with another dog. Or, if you are looking to add multiple dogs to your home, I can be adopted with another pup in my family (the more the merrier, right?). The folks at ARNO tell me that I'm the adventurous one of my family - I'm the only one who tries to climb up into the kiddie pool to get a drink of water. I have a good energy level - I am very happy to go for a casual walk around the neighborhood or hang out with other dogs, but I equally enjoy my down time - I love to take naps. I also like to spend time with people; I'm friendly when meeting someone new, and in fact, you'll find me walking right up to nice people to tell them hello! If you are looking for a friendly, lowkey, and fun pup to add to your home, then look no further because I'm your guy.\n\n\nMy adoption fee is $200. This includes a spay/neuter, up-to-date vaccines, deworming, a microchip, a heartworm test, and, if needed, heartworm treatment.\n\n________________________________________________\n\nFor all animals that have not been spayed or neutered a $100 deposit will be required in addition to the adoption fee.

I'm a silly senior pup who is ready to wiggle my way into your heart and win you over with my A+ personality. The nice people at ARNO tell me what a sweet boy I am. I was rescued with my mom (Chewie) and my 4 siblings (Mojo, Pudgy, Twoie, and Tiri), and we are all up for adoption. I can be adopted by myself or into a house with another dog. Or, if you are looking to add multiple dogs to your home, I can be adopted with another pup in my family (the more the merrier, right?). I'm definitely the goofy one of the group - I love rolling in the grass and getting belly rubs. Even though I'm a senior, I still have a zest for life; I enjoy a nice walk around the neighborhood, and I like to hang out in the play yard with other dogs. Don't be deterred by my little cherry eye - that is a minor surgery that will be fixed for me in a jiffy! I'm lovable, easygoing, friendly with people and dogs, and walk well on a leash. If you are looking for a couch companion and someone to share your snacks with then look no further because I'm ready to come home with you!\n\n\nMy adoption fee is $200. This includes a spay/neuter, up-to-date vaccines, deworming, a microchip, a heartworm test, and, if needed, heartworm treatment.\n\n________________________________________________\n\nFor all animals that have not been spayed or neutered a $100 deposit will be required in addition to the adoption fee.

            "description": "Greta\nBreed: Pitbull mix\nDOB: 10/01/2019\nGender: Female\nAdoption fee: $175\nGreta is a sweet girl with a quiet nature. It takes Greta a few minutes to warm up to new people but once she accepts you she's a friend for life. She is going to make a devoted companion for a calm loving family. Greta enjoys the company of other dogs and children. Greta's ideal new home will be willing to help her with house-training and socialize her with people. With a little help Greta will be the most well behaved dog around!!! If you would like to meet Greta, please fill out an adoption application today!!!Please read the animal bios completely before requesting additional information as we do our best to answer the most frequently ask questions in these bios. \n\nIn order to adopt one of our animals an application must be submitted and approved. You can find these applications by going to http://humanemorgan.org/index.php?page=adoption \n\nABOUT ADOPTING FROM THE HSMC: \nThe shelter address is 1170 Fairground Rd. Madison, GA 30650. For more information on any of our pets, please feel free to email us at INFO@HUMANEMORGAN.ORG give us a call at 706-343-9977. \nAll dogs are heartworm negative, current on vaccines/dewormings, and microchipped. \nAll cats are FeLv/FIV negative, current on vaccines/dewormings, and microchipped. \nWe are open 10am-5pm Monday-Saturday, we schedule our last adoption at 4pm everyday to allow our staff enough time to feed and walk dogs. \nWe are an animal shelter and therefore are not able to individually potty train our residents. Many adult dogs do arrive \"\"house broken\"\" however due to animal behavior any change in environment will make an emotional impact on the animals and therefore initiate unwanted behaviors during the acclamation period. Please keep this in mind. Puppies do not have the biological maturity to maintain absolute bladder or bowel control and will require a certain degree of potty training and house breaking. Please consider the time and commitment it takes to provide the necessary building blocks for these special babies, prior to submitting your application. \nIf you have any questions please email us at info@humanemorgan.org and provide name of the animal you are interested in, in the subject line. \nThank you, HSMC Staff \n\nADOPTION FEES Adoption Fees may change without notice. Always verify the fee when finalizing the adoption. \n~ Cats and Kittens ~ \n* Under 1 Year = $100 \n* 1-5 Years = $75 \n* Over 5 Years = $50 \n** Purebred cats and kittens may be subject to special pricing \n\n~ Mix Breed Dogs ~ \n* Under 1 Year = $200 \n* 1 -3 Years = $175 \n* 4-8 Years = $150 \n* Over 8 Years = $100\n\n~ Purebred and Designer Breed Dogs ~ \n* Under 1 Year = $375 \n* 1-3 Years = $350 \n* 4-8 Years = $275 \n* Over 8 Years = $150 \n\n~ Medical and Special Needs ~ \nWe have rescued dogs and cats which require additional medical care or that have special needs which are not life threatening. In these cases we may require a higher fee to help recoup the costs of their care while at our rescue.",

            "description": "Woody is a wonderful, fun-loving pup who is ready to go with you to infinity and beyond! He likes to live an active lifestyle and is ready to join you on all the outdoor adventures. He also really enjoys playing with his toys and running around with a crew of other canines. He currently lives with two other dogs, who he loves to play and cuddle with. Even though they are smaller than Woody and occasionally try to show him who's boss, he is very patient with them. When he goes on walks, he loves to sniff all the things, and although he can get a little carried away with his bark when saying hello to other dogs, he typically just wants to play. Woody is very patient when he needs to go out, and he also knows basic commands (e.g., sit, down, come, shake), and is happy to show them off as long as he isn't in a highly stimulating environment. He is happiest when he is with his people and is looking for someone who can be very patient with him if he needs to be left alone. He would do best in a home without cats. If you are looking for an affectionate best friend who loves to snuggle, look no further! Even though Woody likes to be active, he is happy to snooze until you are ready to start the day, and is always happy to snuffle up for a solid nap. He's loving, silly, outgoing and absolutely ready to find his forever home! Come meet Woody today!",

Eight is a great age! Still lively and fun loving yet also lives to relax! Papa was pulled from @nycacc right at the start of Covid. Pops is about 60 pounds so a medium size and he currently is lucky to be in a Foster home \n\nPapa Elf is ok on leash, he does get happily excited when he sees people so he may jump up to greet you, but his foster peeps are working on that. Once he knows hes safe, hes loving and he has lots of energy to play. He sleeps in his crate like a good boy and his favorite toy is a ducky!! He adores rolling around in the grass and listens to commands. \n\nPapa gets along with other dogs and a proper intro is mandatory to be set up for success! Hes not a fan of kitties (his loss lol). Mr. Elf will do best in a home that is consistent with rules - he thrives with a strong leader. Hes neutered, up to date on vaccines and housebroken. He is doing so wonderful with all the structure he now has!! \n\nWhy oh why is this boy still homeless? He matters just like they all do. Do you have a space in your home and heart to make his dreams come true? \nIf you would like to hear more about Papa Elf DM or apply at www.puppykittynyc.org \n\n @williamjamesmedia",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Thank you for your interest in adopting one of our foster animals! The first step in the adoption process is submitting an application. Please visit our website for more information and a link to the application: www.kgarl.org/info/adoption\nAdoption process\n\nOnce your application is received, the application process begins. We will review your application, check your references, check with your vet (if there are other animals in the household), speak to a landlord (if you rent), and arrange for a home visit.\n\nSubmitting an application does not guarantee a specific dog or cat. We strive to match the personality and needs of our foster dogs and cats to a family who will best fulfill those needs. If a family is not approved for a particular pet, it does not mean they will not be a good pet owner, it just means that their needs and the needs of the particular pet don't match. We do not adopt on a \"first come, first serve\" basis.\n\nPlease note that we do not do same day adoptions. If you are applying for a popular animal (such as puppies, small dogs, or special breeds), it can take several days for our volunteers to reach a decision that is best for the animal. We understand that it's difficult to wait, but please don't email us multiple times a day to check on the status of your application. We are a very small group and the same people that are reviewing your application are also replying to hundreds of emails and facebook messages. We are all volunteers and have full time jobs outside of KGARL, so any time spent replying to emails/messages is time we are not reviewing your application.\n\nOnce your application is pre-approved (meaning, we don't see any red flags based on our preliminary review of your application), the applicant may be invited to meet their potential family member at a location convenient to the foster family (usually at the King George Petco). Adoptions will NOT take place at the meet & greet, this is just a chance for us to get to know you and for you to spend time with our animals. After the meet and greet, we will ask that you spend some time thinking over your decision and we will do the same.\n\nAfter the application review process is complete (meet & greet with animal, home visit, reference/vet checks, background check, etc.), if all is acceptable to both adopter and KGARL and we all agree to move forward, we will schedule a day/time to finalize the adoption. The adopter will be asked to sign the final paperwork and we will collect the adoption fee (cash, check, or paypal are all acceptable). At this time, you can either pick up your pet, or schedule a time to do so. Adopters will be required to schedule an appointment with their veterinarian of choice within 10 days of taking your new pet home.\n\nAll Adoptions Include:\n\nLifetime of free advice from KGARL!\n\nSpayed or Neutered Pet\n\nHeartworm, FIV, Feline Leukemia Testing\n\nComplete medical records\n\nUp to date on core vaccines\n\nOn Flea/Tick Preventative\n\nMicrochipped\n\nSample of Pet Food\n\nAdoption Fees (unless otherwise noted in the pet's description):\n\nSpecial Breeds of Dogs: See pet's description\nPuppies: $400\nAdult Dogs : $350\nAdult Hounds and Beagles: $250\nKittens: $125\nAdult Cats: $100",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Thank you for your interest in adopting one of our foster animals! The first step in the adoption process is submitting an application. Please visit our website for more information and a link to the application: www.kgarl.org/info/adoption\nAdoption process\n\nOnce your application is received, the application process begins. We will review your application, check your references, check with your vet (if there are other animals in the household), speak to a landlord (if you rent), and arrange for a home visit.\n\nSubmitting an application does not guarantee a specific dog or cat. We strive to match the personality and needs of our foster dogs and cats to a family who will best fulfill those needs. If a family is not approved for a particular pet, it does not mean they will not be a good pet owner, it just means that their needs and the needs of the particular pet don't match. We do not adopt on a \"first come, first serve\" basis.\n\nPlease note that we do not do same day adoptions. If you are applying for a popular animal (such as puppies, small dogs, or special breeds), it can take several days for our volunteers to reach a decision that is best for the animal. We understand that it's difficult to wait, but please don't email us multiple times a day to check on the status of your application. We are a very small group and the same people that are reviewing your application are also replying to hundreds of emails and facebook messages. We are all volunteers and have full time jobs outside of KGARL, so any time spent replying to emails/messages is time we are not reviewing your application.\n\nOnce your application is pre-approved (meaning, we don't see any red flags based on our preliminary review of your application), the applicant may be invited to meet their potential family member at a location convenient to the foster family (usually at the King George Petco). Adoptions will NOT take place at the meet & greet, this is just a chance for us to get to know you and for you to spend time with our animals. After the meet and greet, we will ask that you spend some time thinking over your decision and we will do the same.\n\nAfter the application review process is complete (meet & greet with animal, home visit, reference/vet checks, background check, etc.), if all is acceptable to both adopter and KGARL and we all agree to move forward, we will schedule a day/time to finalize the adoption. The adopter will be asked to sign the final paperwork and we will collect the adoption fee (cash, check, or paypal are all acceptable). At this time, you can either pick up your pet, or schedule a time to do so. Adopters will be required to schedule an appointment with their veterinarian of choice within 10 days of taking your new pet home.\n\nAll Adoptions Include:\n\nLifetime of free advice from KGARL!\n\nSpayed or Neutered Pet\n\nHeartworm, FIV, Feline Leukemia Testing\n\nComplete medical records\n\nUp to date on core vaccines\n\nOn Flea/Tick Preventative\n\nMicrochipped\n\nSample of Pet Food\n\nAdoption Fees (unless otherwise noted in the pet's description):\n\nSpecial Breeds of Dogs: See pet's description\nPuppies: $400\nAdult Dogs : $350\nAdult Hounds and Beagles: $250\nKittens: $125\nAdult Cats: $100",

            "description": "As 2020 is behind us we all have lots to be thankful for. And for our shelter one would be the incredible improvement in 2 sibling German Shepherds Boone and Zena(now adopted).  They lived their first 3 years in such a difficult situation. And they came to us \"skin and bones\" with little fur. It has taken a few months but these sweet pups are now beginning to enjoy life! After some quality food, medicated baths, lots of socialization, and loving TLC from our great volunteers. Boone is very treat motivated, is so happy to see us, and has a bark as deep as a baritone singer. He will continue to need more socialization and positive training. He would do best in a home without kitties or young children. We can't wait to find that very special loving forever families for Boone! His DOB is 7/23/17.\n\nDog adoption fee is $259. This includes the spay or neuter surgery, age appropriate current vaccines, microchip, and preventative flea treatment.\n\nFor any questions regarding the application process or a specific dog or cat please email info@sunnyskysshelter.org. If you have not received a reply in 48 hours please verify your email address. Emailed questions are typically answered within 24 hours.\n\nThank you for your interest in one of our rescue pets. During this unprecedented time we venture into the unknown together and we thank you for your understanding and patience during this process. Together we are working toward the same goal of providing forever homes for all our furry friends.",

She is a great cuddler and loves yard time (but can climb shorter fences, usually just to play with other dogs)! She hates loud noises and will take some patience in introducing her to a new environment! Ideally a home with older residents who are around more since she seems to have separation anxiety. She gets along very well with other dogs that are her size, and would love a companion. She is good with others as long as they are not too noisy.

So though everyone else got safe a little earlier, Buddy is now, and forever will be safe!\n\nHe is said to be a ridgeback/hound mix, 11 years old, heartworm positive but otherwise healthy.

Together with their mother, these puppies are fostered in a calm and caring foster home in Scottsdale, AZ. \n\nWe are looking for adoptive families who preferably have experience with the Weimaraner and/or German Shepherd breeds, and who have the flexibility and plenty of time to raise their puppy and be with him or her both during weekdays and on weekends . \nSpecifically, we are looking for families who are home most of the time, and whose lives are centered around their pets, as this is what is preferred by most members of the Weimaraner breed.\n\nA structured program of learning obedience and socialization will be required from adopters. The puppies are ready to go to their adoptive homes immediately. \n\nIf you are interested in one of these puppies and would like more information before submitting an application for adoption, PLEASE EMAIL us at contact@weimaranerrescue.org .\nPlease do not send an interest through Petfinder, email us directly at the address listed above. \nWhen emailing us please tell us more about yourselves, your family, your lifestyle, and what you are looking for in an adoptive dog. \nWe receive so many generic inquiries each day, so please feel free to share information. \nWe are a transparent organization and are happy to share equally with you.\n\nThank you!",

Max has been with HHS for quite a bit while we figured out some of his behavioral stuff. Max can be reactive around other dogs and due to his large size, his reaction can be pretty scary to some folks. We know Max just doesn't know the proper way to say \"hi\" to his fellow canines and with a little help, he'd be the perfect pup. So, with the help of Breakthrough K9's training experts and their intensive reactive dog training regimen, Max is now well on his way to learning the world isn't such a scary place! \n \n\n\nLike most rotties, Max is an absolute goofball at heart. He loves nothing more than curling up to watch some TV with his person. He likes to mosey outside once in awhile to sniff around, but he's a true lazybones when it comes down to it. He loves cuddling with his stuffies and is perfectly crate trained (he loves to sleep there!) and potty trained. \n \n\n\nMax will need an owner who is confident and has dealt with reactive dogs before. The owner must also agree to attend training sessions, at no cost, with Max at Breakthrough K9 in Mechanicsville, VA, so they can learn all of the skills and techniques needed to keep Max calm, cool, and collected when faced with day-to-day stressors. \n \n\n\nWe are so excited to see the new and improved Max once he's graduated from his training. We're sure Max is bound to find his forever home very soon! \n \n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Max, please fill out an application at www.henricohumane.org/adopt-a-dog",

            "description": "Mikey was born 12/5/2019 in a foster home in Georgia. He was adopted at 8 weeks old by a family in Georgia, who moved to Orlando, FL in February. At that time, they decided Mikey could no longer be a part of their family (he didn't seem to like their two children) and instead of giving the dog back to the rescue (WE REQUIRE YOU RETURN MIKEY TO US IF YOU EVER HAVE TO REHOME HIM) she gave him away to what she thought would be a good home. The man seemed very nice, but shortly after taking Mikey, he lost his job to COVID-19 and gave the dog to his mother, who let Mikey go.\n\nMikey was run over by a car in late September. Hillsborough County Pet Resource Center ended up with him and when no dog rescues stepped up, a cat rescue did, so they wouldn't euthanize him. \n\nHis vet bills were over $3,000 and we're still getting him healthy enough to be adopted. He had punctures in his lungs, was missing a lot of skin, and is now terrified of walking by roads with cars (but he loves to ride in cars!). \n\nHe LOVES to sit on the couch and in your lap. He loves to sleep in the bed with you. VERY friendly. VERY affectionate. He just needs time to get to know you. He LOVES his foster mommy now!! He'll be the best dog ever.\n\nHe loves his foster brothers, a 80lb Shepherd mix and a 70lb Shepherd mix.  Mikey will be about 65-70lbs at his ideal weight, but he is not a tall dog and can't counter surf. He will need stairs to get on and off of the couch and bed. He can jump up, but he shouldn't be. Allowing him to jump when he's young will make life harder on him when he's older.\n\nIt's likely he'll need special care when he gets into his 8 or 9 years of age. If you can't afford to care for him (a possible wheelchair when he's older, possible arthritis) when he's older DO NOT ADOPT HIM. He is a part of the family, not a decoration!\n\nIf you can't afford him, you can't adopt him.\n\nHis adoption fee is $300. He is neutered, vaccinated, heartworm free, flea free, and ready for adoption in November to the BEST HOME out there. We will be very picky, we don't want him abandoned again. \n\nNo children under the age of 13. No small dogs, he likes to romp and doesn't know how big he is. No elderly people in the home, as he jumps when he's excited and will easily knock down a child or an older person and potentially hurt them.\n\nYou CANNOT LIVE NEAR A BUSY ROAD and you must OWN YOUR OWN HOME to adopt Mikey. We will be doing a home check, and every member of the family must meet MIkey.",

They are chunky girls at 17 lbs (Missy) and 14lbs (Maggie). Sadly, they lost their owner to Covid recently and now these girls are in need of a new home ASAP!! They were their owners entire world and were very spoiled. These girls are not bonded. So they can go to foster or adoptive homes together or separate. They are a little timid at first but don\u2019t have any aggression. If you go a little slow they open up within minutes. They truly are sweet little lap babies who need a new lap to call their own. If you can help either temporary or forever with one or both of these girls, please fill out an app below. They will be fully utd and altered before placement!\n\nAll dogs have a $175 adoption fee which includes vet check, age appropriate shots (atleast 2 sets for puppies), dewormer, heartworm test (if over 6 months), rabies (if atleast 16 weeks) and spay/neuter! Puppies will be altered before adoption. All rescues and shelters practice pediatric spay and neuter. This is essential in our rescue efforts and it is a policy that we will stick by. All dogs over 8 weeks and 2 pounds will be altered before adoption. There are no exceptions to this rule on all healthy and adoptable dogs. \n\nPuppies/Dogs that are not available for adoption due to vetting not being complete can be reserved with an approved application and a non refundable $50 deposit. This deposit is applied to your adoption fee and the remaining $125 is due at pick up.\n\nWags and Whiskers is an all-volunteer rescue. We also have full-time jobs and Families. We will try to answer all questions and applications in a timely manner. Please be patient and bear with us .

            "description": "NEWBIE ALERT!!\n\nThis gorgeous girl is Cami! She came to us with her mom and siblings several months back. She was adopted to a family up north but due to no fault of her own the adoption didn\u2019t give through and she\u2019s still available. Cami is a gorgeous Black lab mix. She\u2019s around 4 months old and 20 lbs. Cami is as sweet as they come. She\u2019s very well socialized. Cami is great with dogs, cats and kids. She\u2019s playful and truly a great pup. She\u2019s perfect for any family. Cami is utd, dewormed and spayed! \n\n\nAll dogs have a $175 adoption fee which includes vet check, age appropriate shots (atleast 2 sets for puppies), dewormer, heartworm test (if over 6 months), rabies (if atleast 16 weeks) and spay/neuter! Puppies will be altered before adoption. All rescues and shelters practice pediatric spay and neuter. This is essential in our rescue efforts and it is a policy that we will stick by. All dogs over 8 weeks and 2 pounds will be altered before adoption. There are no exceptions to this rule on all healthy and adoptable dogs. \n\nPuppies/Dogs that are not available for adoption due to vetting not being complete can be reserved with an approved application and a non refundable $50 deposit. This deposit is applied to your adoption fee and the remaining $125 is due at pick up.\n\nWags and Whiskers is an all-volunteer rescue. We also have full-time jobs and Families. We will try to answer all questions and applications in a timely manner. Please be patient and bear with us . Do not contact Parkway Animal Hospital as they are a vet clinic and can not answer questions on behalf of Wags and Whiskers. All questions and comments must go directly through the rescue. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION\n\nhttps://form.jotform.us/70898112177159\n",

She has taken quite a bit of time to get used to living in a house and she does spook with loud noises.  She has not been around cats yet, but her foster thinks she would be best in a home without them, as she does have a prey drive towards other small animals.  She is good with other dogs and has not been around small children yet.  She is a quiet dog and rarely ever barks.  She is still working on her housetraining, but having been in rescue her whole life, this may take some more time.  She is scared of being in the car and also not used to being on a leash.  She hasn\u2019t had interest in toys yet.  Overall, this quiet girl is still getting used to her new circumstances and it may take some more time for her to realize that she is safe and cared for.  She is looking for a new home who will take their time with her and allow her to come out of her shell in her own time.\n\nOur rescue is called BARCS. We are a registered Non Profit.\nOur Website is www.barcsrescue.com. All our animals are posted on the website and updated often. If you would like to proceed we need an adoption application to be filled out. They can be found on our website. Once we receive your application, we will contact you to arrange a meeting with the pup you are interested in. \nWe look forward to hearing from you\n",

Our veterinary partner estimates that Nadia is 5-6 years old at the time of intake in October 2020. Nadia is good with people of all ages and other dogs. Nadia's story is heartbreaking . . . she was found as a stray with a huge tumor in her mouth that prevented her from eating properly. Nadia had been dumped by her owner--the same owner who allowed that tumor to grow for so long without medical treatment. As soon as we received a plea to help this very sweet pup, we of course said YES! Our veterinary partner has removed the tumor, and with it part of Nadia's jaw, but Nadia is now happy and pain free and she can finally smile! We can't change where Nadia has been, but we can certainly change where she's going! And she's going to a happy forever home to live a fantastic life. If you would like to take Nadia on her journey to her happy life, please apply online to adopt Nadia (TX) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

Now, she has already forgotten all about her past life, and is ready for fun!\n\nHaili is a small pitbull, less than 40 pounds, and less than a year old. She is attentive, fun, and very athletic. Haili loves more than anything to play tug. \n\nShe is alright on the leash, that is, if you have a tug toy with you! Otherwise she sometimes eats the leash. Haili is potty and crate trained for the most part, but still needs to go somewhat frequently. \n\nShe has only greeted dogs leashed, so far, but that has been going well. \n\nApply here to foster-to-adopt Haili:\nrebeldogsdetroit.com/applytoadopt\n\nIncluded in the adoption fee of $275 is utd vaccines and dewormer, microchip and her spay surgery.",

            "description": "Piksi arrived to the U.S. from Iran on November 10th. They literally took his crate off the plane and loaded it in the back of my car. He was in transport and in the crate for 36 hours! The woman who assisted with the transport told me that Piksi had been found on the street in Iran when he was approximately 6-8 weeks old. His ears had been cut off and were still bleeding when they found him. He was taken to a shelter where he stayed in a kennel indoors for the next 10 months of his life. When he finally came out of the crate in my back yard, it was the first time he had ever walked on grass. I have since renamed him Jupiter, and he does answer to that name. (He's much too large to be a Piksi, and he didn't recognize that name anyway!) He is a very large dog, he weighs approximately 80 lbs. He has a beautiful, thick, and very soft tawny coat with black points. He is a gorgeous dog! He did not have the advantage of any training or socialization or even kindness for the first year of his life. He was terrified of everything when he first arrived - leashes, cars, noises, etc. He has made tremendous progress. But he is still trying to figure out the world around him. He lacks confidence, and cannot determine who is friend or foe. He is very wary of other dogs and men. We are currently working with a trainer to build his confidence. He would do well with a strong owner who can give him boundaries, which make him feel safer. He is relaxed here in his foster home, and even has a canine buddy that he loves to play with. When he feels safe and relaxed, he is a real sweetheart! Unfortunately, he still sees lots of danger in the world and most situations make him very uncomfortable, but we're working on that. Because of his size and fearfulness, he will need a home with no young children (under 15) or other pets. And he will need to continue his training and have boundaries set for him. He does much better in quiet environments, where there isn't a lot of commotion. With patience, consistent boundaries, and training, he can grow into a loyal, relaxed companion.Accuracy is not guaranteed; however, information provided is accurate to the best of our knowledge.\n\nFor more information on the pet, please send an email to info@aforeverhome.org",

Lorenzo will need to be restricted from exercise during treatment. Would need to foster for around 3 months. \n\nLorenzo is around 5 years old. He is much bigger than he appears here, and he's a strong boy. Lorenzo was very good for me coming out of his kennel and going back. He's gentle and loves attention. I got my face licked several times when I got too close, and he kept wanting to shake. :) He does not get along with other animals. Lorenzo will be a great friend to some lucky person. If you would like to meet this handsome boy, please email the shelter at cchs04@sbcglobal.net and request an application.",

Our veterinary partner estimates that Scarlett is 1.5 years old at the time of intake in November 2020. Scarlett is good with people of all ages but prefers to be the only dog in her forever home. This beautiful girl came into rescue with a terrible skin condition which has caused her to lose her fur. But her fur is growing back and she will soon be even more beautiful than she is now, if that's possible!\nScarlett is a mellow girl except for short bursts of energy outside. She loves tossing her toys up in the air and retrieving them. She is happy and wags her tail all the time. Scarlett loves belly rubs and being the center of attention.\nScarlett needs a forever home where she will be loved and cherished as a member of her forever family. If you can give Scarlett a leaf on your family tree, please apply online to adopt Scarlett (TX) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Are you looking for a couch potato? Well, swipe left 'cause that ain't Margarita, or Rita or RiRi for short. She's the epitome of a shepherd. She thinks that ball is life, thrives on training and structure and is super smart (and a little naughty). She is looking for a leader in her life, a partner, adventure buddy and a best friend. She'll give you 1000% and she is looking for someone that will give the same back to her. Is that you?\n\nRita is awesome. She's quiet in her crate and will have the most bizarre sleeping positions. She brings the ball right to your feet and sits for the next throw (and it better be a looong one!). Stuffy toys were meant to be deconstructed. She is beyond super smart and picks up what you want her to do right away. She's also a velcro dog so get ready to always have company no matter what you do. She is a champion snuggler and there is nothing better after a good play time than snuggles and kisses on the couch or being a bed hog. She loves pets and kisses and will be very insistent that you give her love. She rides like a champ in the car. She takes treats oh, so gently and has the softest cuddliest fur around. I can't stop kissing her gorgeous face. She will bury her head in your lap for cuddles and ear rubs. And she makes me laugh every day with her goofy face and sweet nature. Of course, Rita will push your buttons a few times to make sure you mean that she really, really can't pull that toy out of the trash. I mean, she worked really hard on it. Typical teenager stuff.\n\nLike all of us, she's working on being her best doggie self. She gets too excited and will jump for the ball out of your hand but just needs to be reminded that good girls sit for a ball throw. She's working on her leash skills, especially when there are distractions around. She's lived with 10 dogs before but forgets to be cool in meeting new dogs and her over the top energy might not make her a favorite with some dogs. We have been working on her leash skills and she has made tremendous progress. We visit Home Depot and pet stores to work on her leash skills and being cool around lots of people, dogs and noise. She honestly can do anything as long as you have a tennis ball around as a reward and is one of the smartest dogs I've ever met.\n\nIf you are looking for a dog that will truly be a partner in your life, that will be active with you and where the two of you will grow a deep and meaningful relationship, then she's the one for you. Are you the one for her?\n\nBasics: Female, 55#, active, HW-, spayed and located near Martinsburg WV.

            "description": "I am Groot!\n\nLittle blind Groot was found as a stray. He had no microchip, was very matted, and couldn't walk when he got to Orange County Shelter! He is approximately 10 years old and weighs 20 lbs. When Groot arrived at Frosted Faces he could walk, but was very stiff. Following an examination and X-rays by our vet, we learned Groot has IVDD (Intervertebral Disk Disease).\n\nHe has been receiving acupuncture weekly at Frosted Faces, and it's been helping him! He now can go for short walks and really enjoys himself, as you can see in the cute video included with Groot's photos.\n\nGroot has been on an extended Frosted Fling. His Fling Mom decided to extend it, because she noticed Groot's mobility improving, and his cute personality blossoming! She reports Groot is potty trained and gives a little bark when he needs to go out. He holds it through the night as he sleepw on a dog bed.\n\nThere are four other dogs in Groot's Fling home, and he gets along very well with them!\n\nHe's a great work-from-home buddy, laying at his Fling Mom's feet and rubbing against her legs when it's time to take a break and give hime some cuddles! Groot especially loves when his Fling Mom holds him like a baby. His legs have grown stronger from going on several short walks daily, and he really enjoys them. Groot loves being outside in the warm sunshine. He's such a sweet boy, and he asks for so little.\n\nGroot's\n\nwish for 2021 is to find a Forever Family. Might that be you? Apply at:\nwww.frostedfacesfoundation.org/apply\n\nVisit us at Open House: Saturdays & Sundays, 10 am - 1 pm.\n\nLearn more about our programs at www.frostedfacesfoundation.org/family. No adoption fees and we help with medical costs!\n\nQuestions: adopt@frostedfacesfoundation.org\n\nUpdated: 1/31/21 KG",

            "description": "Looks like: Chihuahua Mix\nFemale, 3 years old, 12 pounds\n\nTosh greets every day with spunk and enthusiasm and pays little attention to her funny gait. History of scoliosis? Not if you ask her! While she is a little uncoordinated due to this medical history, she doesn't let that stop her. She walks well on a leash, but does use a lot of energy when she walks so prefers them to be on the shorter side. But don't worry, she'll be sure to let you know when she gets tired. \n\nTosh gets along well with other dogs and is a social butterfly who loves being around people. She loves squeaker toys and ADORES treats. She loves snuggles and gives lots of kisses. She is a fairly quiet gal, but does bark to show how excited and happy she is when her person returns home. She does well in the car, sleeps through the night, and is great in the home. \n\nTosh would do best in a house with no stairs, as her condition means she needs to avoid stairs completely or be carried up and down them. Additionally, she would do best in a house that has carpeting or rugs to help her move around more easily. Her desire to be around people means she'd also do best in a house with a person who is around a lot to give her the love she deserves - and she'll give it right back! \n\nTosh came to POMDR from Santa Cruz County Animal Shelter and is ready to make her next transition into her forever home!",

            "description": "There's no place like home for the holidays, and nobody's wishing for a home more than sweet Sage. \nMeet SAGE. 3 years young, 45 lb shepherd mix who is READY to go home. Sage loves to be out in the yard, and she can jump 5 feet in the air- No joke! If you're looking for an AGILITY star, Sage is your gal! If you like to adventure on long walks in the woods, or run on the levee in the early mornings, Sage is your gal! If you are a couch potato, or leave your dog home alone for long periods of time, Sage is probably not a good match for you. We are looking for someone that will be willing to work with Sage and channel her energy in constructive ways. We think that once she's in a home that will set appropriate boundaries, keep her senses engaged, and provide consistency, that Sage will settle into the perfect dog. Sage is affectionate, super, DUPER happy, and adores people. She\u2019s a great size too- not too big, and not too small. She\u2019s beautiful, and she is food motivated, which can be helpful for training. Sage is not appreciative of other dogs or cats, and so she will need to be your one and only.  As mentioned, Sage can jump impressively high; this is something to take into consideration if you have young children. As it is, she can easily jump up to kiss grownups on the face with no problems! Sage is heart worm positive and will be treated at no cost to her adopter. Sage is available for rescue, foster or adoption at the JPAS West Bank location.  Call 504 349-5111 or email RYeaton@jeffparish.net for more info. \n\nAdoption fee includes vaccinations, spay/neuter, heartworm test, and microchip.\n\n*Dogs are pending behavior and other-animal assessment unless otherwise noted here.\n\n\nAvailable for adoption, foster, or rescue at:\n\nJefferson Parish Animal Shelter - Westbank\n2701 Lapalco Blvd; Harvey, LA 70058\n504-349-5111 \n\nPlease provide ID number when visiting shelter. Thanks!\n\nAdoption application can be downloaded through the link below and emailed to ryeaton@jeffparish.net\n\nhttp://bit.ly/JPASadoptionapp",

            "description": "Mimosa is a very pretty girl who weighs in around 50 pounds.  She is probably about 2 yrs old and is a terrier mix.  She is a very friendly girl and does well with the other dogs in her foster home.  She adores people and overall is well behaved.  She has met a variety of other dogs (ages and sizes) here and has been great with all of them.  She ls playful but also enjoys chilling with you.  If you would be interested in two dogs, she would recommend her best friend Dory who is also looking for a home but is much shyer and has in many ways come to rely on Mimosa.\n\nThe next step is to fill out an online application. Once we have reviewed your application we will get back to you as soon as possible. We have the right to decline an application if it is not a good fit for that particular animal. \n\nNot yet ready to adopt?  You can sponsor a pet now to help pay for medical expenses, special diets, toys and treats, emergency medical care, etc., to provide for him or her during foster care.  Our adoption fee rarely covers our expenses, so any size donation is appreciated!   You can donate by check or Paypal by visiting our website at www.cofas.org \n\n\n********************************************\nAll of our dogs are fostered in our homes so we know their temperaments.  They are spayed or neutered, up to date on shots, de-wormed, heartworm tested (and treated if necessary), and on flea and heartworm prevention. Our adoption fee begins at $195.00 for all of our dogs and puppies. Our goal is to match our animals to the best home possible.  Please email info@cofas.org for more information.  You can also fill out an application at www.cofas.org",

His favorite thing is to stretch out on his belly and army crawl around the house - It's never fails to make his foster parents laugh hysterically. His house manners are immaculate - kennel trained, house trained, non-destructive and can free roam when you're gone without issue. Mr. Clean is a special boy with particular behavioral needs - he is looking for an adopter with plenty of time to dedicate to his behavioral needs and continue his training. He is a highly active boy who does not care for the couch potato lifestyle. He is an insanely smart, highly motivated dog. He aims to please his people and quickly learns new skills. His excitement/engagement when training with his foster mom is beyond impressive - he is just happy to be involved with whatever his human is doing. If you're looking for a loyal, active companion who will help you grow as a dog owner, Mr. Clean is your guy. Mr. Clean will need a home without any children under 16 and no other pets. \nPlease email foster@kcpetproject.org for more information. Thank you!",

            "description": "Maple is a 5 year old female Catahoula mix. She weighs 86 pounds. A nice person found her wandering around as a stray and brought her to the shelter. Maple is super sweet girl who loves running around and playing with her toys. She can be a little nervous of new people at first but warms up quickly. This beautiful girl is looking for an active home where she will get tons on love and attention. Children and other dogs make her nervous so she would do best in an adult only home without other pets. She is working on housebreaking, and walks well on a leash. She is heartworm positive but don\u2019t worry, the shelter pays for her treatment.\n\nADOPTION HOURS: \n\nWe are currently adopting out animals by appointment only Tuesday through Sunday 1:00 P.M. through 4:00 P.M. with an approved application.

Colton family give him because they no longer want to take care of him and his siblings. A friend contacted me about Colton and his sibling. The two older dogs were going to be drop off at shelter to have put down since they no longer want to take care of old dogs. And Colton was going to the pound as well since they no longer want to take care of any pets in the family. How do you wake up one day and say HEY I do not want any of my family members anymore because that is who they are family members?  \nColton is now neuter, up today with vaccines and microchip. Colton is ready for his new family who will love him, taking care of him and Colton will be a part of the family. When Colton first meet you, he will bark his head off but only to say hello. He is not a known bite case he will bark and then come up to you smell you wag his tail and then kiss you to death. \n\nUNFORTUNATELY, COLTON DOES NOT CARE FOR THE MALE GENDER SO HE HAVE TO BE WITH A FAMILY ONLY  FEMALE.\n\n\nIf you want to meet Colton please contact Celestine at @ ( 832) 659-2576\n",

            "description": "*Special Needs* (Sorry about the novel... believe it or not this IS the 'short version'!)\nHeads up... cutest dog ever coming through! Hi friends! My name is Ronan and I am about 2-3 years old. I have a secret special power that makes everyone I meet fall in love with me. 'Ridiculously charming' would be a great description of me! I seem to have endless energy but also endless snuggles & love. I am a very special guy looking for a very special home. \nI am a bit 'too much' for other pets and children, so I am looking for a home where I can be an only child. The 'parent(s)' I'm looking for is a very specific kind of person. Not only do I need to be an only child, I also have a medical condition that will make most people (understandably) not want to adopt me. \nAs you can see in the photos... I'm kind of... um... naked. I originally came from a shelter in Texas where I was treated for demodex mange. They thought my fur should grow back fine, so they sent me on my way here to Wisconsin to find my forever family. I've been here at DCHS since July, and DCHS has been working with numerous vets to try to figure out my skin issues and why I remain naked. When the special medications, topical sprays, special shampoos & special diet didn't clear things up... I saw a dermatologist. After some biopsies, the results show I have skin cancer. Unfortunately, the cancer is too widespread on my skin to be treated, so my time on this earth is limited. \nI don't know that I am 'sick'... all I know is how badly I want a home of my own. I will need to continue to get weekly baths, and remain on the pain medication for the remainder of my life. How long will I live? No one has an answer for that. \nMy quality of life needs to be closely monitored. I will likely require regular vet visits as I may be more prone to skin infections, and may also need x-rays to check if the cancer is spreading. \nI realize I'm not a highly adoptable dog, and that I come with some substantial 'issues'. I also realize I have a lot of love to give and will be an amazing companion to some lucky person(s)! \n\n(A message from DCHS: Ronan is absolutely correct that he is special, makes everyone fall in love with him, and will be a wonderful companion. He is a very loveable lug and we are 100% dedicated on finding him the right home. At this time, he is not suffering and he is not in need of humane euthanasia. He has life left to live, and wants to spend his days/weeks/months/years in a home... maybe yours? If you are interested in Ronan or have any questions, please feel free to e-mail jwagner@dunncountyhumanesociety.org)\n\nPlacement Recommendations:\nOwner Experience Level: Some Experience\nCats: No Thank You\nDogs: No Thank You\nKids: Middle School +Want to know more? Please call us! We've found that back and forth via email regarding a specific animal is not always effective and quick because our email is not monitored on a regular basis. So, for specific information regarding this wonderful pet, please contact one of our adoption counselors at (715) 232-9790. They are available between the hours of 8 am and 7 pm (7 days a week, excluding holidays). Thanks for your interest!",

She has allergies, which seem to much better since changing her diet to grain free food.  She came to us with such a bad ear infection, her ear looked like cauliflower.  She had to put under anesthesia to clean it out.  She later got two corneal ulcers, which were also attributed to her itchy eyes from allergies.  She has come so far on the grain free diet she is on and I think will continue to get better.  Donna has been through a lot.  She loved the children and her family, but she was being attacked by an older dog in the house and was given up after she was attacked so aggressively she had her head shaved and two puncture wounds when we got her.  Despite her hardships, she is the most loving dog I have ever fostered.  I would keep her if I did not already have two dogs and I know she would be happiest without the competition of other dogs.  I am going to be very picky about the home she goes to because she deserves and needs forever.  \n\nDonna likes short walks, the dog beach or just laying on the couch.  She is obsessed with tennis balls.  \n\nPlease contact us if you have any questions and can provide a home where she can get the care for her allergies she will need.  \n\nEmail mylittletoybreed@yahoo.com",

My favorite game is to search for treats that are hidden under cups or in another room. I take a little time to feel comfortable with new people but games and short walks are a fun way to bond with me. I have SO MANY good qualities- I am loyal, very affectionate, house trained, crate trained, well behaved on car rides, walk great on the leash (even when other nearby dogs bark at me!), and I know how to \"shake\" (you can teach me more fun tricks!). My ideal home would be a calm home with an experienced dog owner (no young kids for me since I get nervous with new people and I'd love to live as an only dog or with another calm dog)- I am currently on activity restriction due to being heartworm positive. 2020 has been quite a year for all of us - including me- I got rescued- yay, but had some medical issues to work out before I could be available for adoption. I'm ready now, but I'm still waiting to find my perfect match- maybe we could meet and make this crazy year have a good ending? Until then, stay safe y'all!",

He is potty trained, does not need to be crated, loves playing with his toys, rocks his basic commands, and loves to please his person. He loves a good walk followed by cuddles on the couch. \n\nColt needs a home where is the only animal and there are no young children in the home. Colt is wary of men and strangers. We are currently working on behavioral training with Falkor & Rescue Friends, NFP. which will be included in his adoption.\n\nInteresting in adopting Colt?

            "description": "Dolly is a 2 year old, spayed female pointer mix. She weighs about 60 pounds. Dolly loves everyone she meets, adults, kids and dogs. Dolly is very sweet and loves to be close to her people. Dolly is well behaved and listens well, but could use some work on counter surfing and jumping. Dolly is a medium to high energy dog that needs an outlet for her energy. She loves other dogs and would love a dog playmate to run with her. A fenced yard would be ideal as she loves to run and would love a playmate to chase her, she\u2019s very fast so they may never catch her. If she were to be an only dog she would need an owner dedicated to walking her, hiking with her or taking her for a run. Toys are very exciting for her and she plays nicely by herself. Dolly is a very sweet dog and will cuddle with you once she\u2019s had her playtime or walk. Dolly is crate trained and has been consistent with going potty outside.\n\nIf you would like to be considered as an adopter for one of our great dogs, please go to our website- www.luckymuttsrescue.org and submit an application. Our process includes landlord approval and vet checks. We try to get applications processed in a timely fashion. Inaccuracies and/or incomplete data will delay and possibly cancel your application from being processed, so please make sure that you include valid information and contact information. You will be contacted via email if there are concerns or questions. Once your application has been processed, you may be contacted by one of our volunteers to set up a home visit interview. After your home visit interview is completed, all of your information is reviewed. If your application is approved, you will be notified. Meet and greets with dogs are only set up with approved applicants, so if you want to meet a dog, it is vital that your home visit is completed and that your application is approved. Adoption fees generally are: \n$400+tax for puppies to 3 years old\n$350+tax for ages 4-7\n$250+tax for ages 8 and up\nThe adoption fee covers spay/neuter, up to date vaccinations, microchip, general deworming, heartworm test and prevention (if old enough) and veterinary inspection certificate. Breeds of dogs are best guesses and we don't guarantee any breed. Adopters are chosen by what situation will be best for the dog. Submitting an application for a particular dog does not guarantee that you will be the applicant chosen to adopt that dog. Lucky Mutts strives to match dogs to the best home and will work with your family to find a good match. Please remember that we are an organization that is completely run by volunteers, so please be patient as many of us work full time jobs, have families and also foster dogs. Thanks for wanting to adopt!",

Dunkin needs time to get to know people and slow proper introductions are key. He does better with women than men. \nFor more information, please call the Pike County Humane Society at  (570)296-7654 or send Email to pikecountyhs@gmail.com.Please Note: Petfinder listings may not always be up to date!

            "description": "I think they named me Chyna after the wrestler, but I'm really not that tough. I'm just a sweet calm girl who likes to walk and hang out with my humans. I'm curious about everything I see, and I love to smell the flowers, take car rides and run alongside a skateboard. I\u2019m good with people and kids, and I've met some dogs that I like as well. I can sleep in my crate or take naps with you, but be ready for action whenever something interesting comes up.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this pooch, please download the Adoption Questionnaire (farescue.org/pdf_files/questionnaire_canine.pdf), fill it out and email it back to us at info@farescue.org or fax (310) 362-0321. You can also meet this and/or other available dogs at our weekend adoptions.\n\n[Chyna is about 5 years old and weighs 66 lbs.]\n\n(2011)",

My sister, Daisy and I were dumped out like trash one day; we were lying in a ditch on the side of the road when a kind stranger picked us up and took us to ARFhouse!\n\nI am a super sweet, energetic Pit Bull mix and I LOVE to play! I need a fenced yard to run and play; I would not be suitable for an apartment. I am approximately 6-8 months old and I currently weigh 30 lbs., but will likely weigh around 55 lbs. fully-grown. I need some basic training but heck, I\u2019m a puppy! I am very smart and eager to learn; I will make a great addition to your family. \n\nThe fee to adopt Lilah is $200.00; this includes spay/neuter, deworming, vaccinations and a microchip. If you are interested in adopting Lilah, please visit our website. www.arfhouse.org and fill out an adoption application. \n\n**Please Note: Lilah is currently located at our facility in Sherman, Texas. Adoptions are by-appointment only; if you would like to meet Lilah, please fill out an application on our website. Once we have your application, our Adoption Coordinator will follow up with you ASAP with any questions she may have, or to set up a meet-and-greet.",

            "description": "Belle is the sweetest girl you will ever meet! She is 11 years young and is a Pit bull Terrier mix and she weighs just over 60 pounds. Meeting Belle you would never know her age by the way she acts as she has the health and activity level of a dog half her age!\nBelle was brought to us with severe skin irritation and inflammation, overgrown nails, ear infection, severe snorting through her nose/mouth and all of her teeth have been chewed down to the nubs. We had her seen by our Vet ASAP and was prescribed some meds for her skin and ears and is feeling so much better! She has finished all her medication, her nails have been trimmed and her snorting is mostly coming from her throat but there is nothing concerning or that can be done for it as she has an elongated soft pallet which just makes her breathing louder than the average dog. It is very important that she doesn't become overweight so as to not put excessive strain on her breathing. Even though she doesn't have much for length of teeth she still eats dry kibble just fine as long as its a smaller kibble and most senior dog food is. \nBelle loves everyone she meets and thinks she is a lapdog! She loves to go for walks and following people around for pets and back scratches! Belle also loves to go for car rides and will hop right up into your vehicle!\nWe have not had the opportunity to test Belle with other dogs or cats but can certainly do that if a prospective home needs us to. We believe that Belle would do well with children 10 and up but not younger as she has no idea what personal space is and may try to sit on a smaller child's lap and accidently hurt them.\nIf you would like to set up a time to meet Belle please give us a call at 641-774-5113 as we are open by appointment only. \n\nIf you would like to donate towards Belle's care please go to the top of this page and click on the Sponsor button. You will then be redirected to her Petfinder Sponsor/Donation page. Any amount is greatly appreciated!",

You can also meet this and/or other available dogs at our weekend adoptions.\n\nHi! So, yeah, I may look like a big guy but I\u2019m actually quite shy. This, coupled with my super smart genes, can initially be a little challenging but once you got my trust, I will be loyal as only a German Shepherd can be. I\u2019m pretty young and shouldn\u2019t have to worry so much but you know, my pal didn\u2019t make it, so\u2026 yeah, I could do with an extra portion of patience, guidance, and love. Do you have what it takes to make me feel safe? \n\n[Ferdinand is about 1.5 years old and weighs 60 lbs.]\n\n(2011)",

This pretty girl has done great with the shelter staff and it wouldn't take her long to warm up to a new home. Venus DOES NOT like other dogs, and we do not know how she would do with cats since she was a stray. We also do not know if Venus is house broken but she is quite smart and eager to please. Kiddos shouldn't be an issue with this girl either. \n\nHer adoption fee is $10.50 and she is ALREADY MICROCHIPPED! Due to the outbreak of Covid-19 our adoption policies have changed. All adoptions are by appointment only. Call to set up an appointment to meet the animal. Dogs are $61.50 and puppies are $59 unless otherwise noted. All cats and kittens are $44 unless otherwise noted. Our system automatically updates petfinders every two hours. Feel free to email us with any questions you may have.",

I\u2019m a lab mix, about 4.5 months old, current on vaccinations, house and crate trained (even though I\u2019d rather sleep with you or be hanging out in the house).  I love playing with my foster humans, my sister and foster buddies but really I\u2019m ready to find that place everyone talks about...my furever home. \n\nA home with a family of my own sounds grand.  I\u2019m hoping my family will be active and take me everywhere they go so I can learn about the world around me.  I like those little humans and other dogs and hope my new home has both.\n\nLonging for the love only a family can offer, Tiny enjoys snuggles in the couch, sleeping at your feet or proudly walking by your side.  If you think Tiny is everything you are looking for, just let us know...we are here to help make your dreams for a puppy come true!  \n\nOur adoption donation is $175.  Tiny is being fostered in Noble.",

Sugar is a 7 yr old, 13 lb female Chihuahua (exbtra COVID weight for sure!), and Cookie is a 5 yr old, 8 lb Chihuahua. This bonded pair was picked up by animal control and brought to a local shelter after their owner passed away. They were so happy to leave the shelter and arrive at their foster home. These friendly, loving girls are spayed, microchipped, up-to-date on vaccinations, and heartworm negative. Both are housebroken as long as they are taken out on a regular basis. They love playing with toys and get along well with other dogs and cats. If you have a couple of spots in your bed they would love to keep you warm this winter. They love to snuggle and don\u2019t take up much room! We would love for them to be adopted together. Did we mention how sweet they are? ??? As always, good vet history, a fenced yard and a live or virtual home visit will be required for approval. Adoption fee: $200/ea.

If you have any questions regarding one of our Mastiffs, please read their bio and if you still have questions- drop us an email at info@greatplainsmastiffrescue.org . If you have questions about our adoption procedures, please go to our Pages of Interest on the left hand column under 'Adoption Info.' We answer email inquiries almost immediately-usually always within a few hours and phone calls are returned with 24-36 hours.\n\nGPMR does not have a shelter. All of our dogs are kept in loving foster homes. We must have a completed adoption\napplication on file before meeting any of our mastiffs.\n\nGPMR adopts to the states of Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, Arkansas, Missouri, Louisiana and parts of Colorado.\n!!!Any mastiffs being adopted out of the state of Oklahoma require a health certificate to be paid for by the adopter!!!\n\nMeet Teddy! This sweet boy was found wandering in rural Texas and rescued by a good Samaritan who reached out to GPMR to take him in. We took him to the vet and guess what - he was microchipped! His owners had gone through a divorce several years ago and rehomed him with a family member and they thought Teddy was still there, so we're not sure what happened. Neither was in a position to take care of Teddy's extensive medical needs so Teddy came into GPMR. We also learned that he is 12 years old!!!!Teddy is in rough shape. He is emaciated, had fleas and intestinal parasites and tested positive for heartworms. His ears are so infected the canals are practically swollen shut. He has 2 large tumors on his anus, one the size of a grape and the other the size of a tennis ball which was ulcerated. Teddy also has some dental disease, eyelid issues and arthritis. He weighed 106 at his first visit when he should closer to 150-160 lbs.Despite being in very bad shape, Teddy has an amazing personality. He seems happy and is eating great. We ran labwork which was mostly normal, and after consulting with the vet we decided to proceed with a surgery. The vet removed the largest anal mass as it was partially covering the anus. They also flushed out his ears and started treatment for his infections.Recovery has been a little hard on this old man and has thrown his appetite off, so our focus right now is getting him eating regularly and put on some much needed weight. Once he's a healthy weight he will be seeking a forever home for Teddy. He does have arthritis like most Mastiffs his age.Teddy is being fostered in DFW area, TXSave a Mastiff...Adopt, Foster, Volunteer!",

I was dumped on the side of the road one day with three of my family members; one of my siblings didn't make it. The cool folks at ARFhouse found us and somehow got all of us into their car and drove straight back to the sanctuary. \n\nI am a super sweet, fun-loving Shepherd mix; I am approximately 2 years old and I weigh 73 lbs. I am a big boy and I need a big yard so that I can run and play anytime I want! I would not be suitable for an apartment. I get along great with other dogs, love people and will make a wonderful addition to your family! \n\nThe fee to adopt Boomer is $200.00; this includes spay/neuter, deworming, vaccinations and a microchip. If you are interested in adopting Boomer, please visit our website. www.arfhouse.org and fill out an adoption application. \n\n**Please Note: Boomer is currently located at our facility in Sherman, Texas. Adoptions are by-appointment only; if you would like to meet Boomer, please fill out an application on our website. Once we have an application, our Adoption Coordinator will follow up with you ASAP.",

I am spayed, heartworm negative, current on shots, micro-chipped, on flea/heartworm prevention, have had a negative fecal and a dental done.  My adoption is $200.\n\nI was rescued from animal services where I ended up after my owner died.\n\nPlease email for an adoption application.  Once the application is approved, we will arrange for you to meet and adopt. \n\nWe do not adopt out of state.\nDue to many bounced checks, we now require that adoption donations be cash only.  However, if you make a general donation to the organization (not associated with the adoption of a pet) we do accept checks and paypal.  If you are unable to adopt right now, won't you please make a donation to help care for the pets?  THANK YOU!!",

            "description": "Meet Bambi, a 3 year old, 75 pound, American Bulldog/Pit Mix. Bambi's breed is just a gues! Bambi is a very sweet girl that loves to play and snuggle! When excited, she bounces like a deer. When she's not in play mode, Bambi is extremely snuggly and will join you on the couch or floor and just relax and shut her eyes when you pet her. She knows some basic commands and is house trained and crate trained although her foster mom says she's so good she can be trusted outside the crate. Bambi will need a home with no other dogs. She has been around children 6 and up and does great with kids. Bambi would make the perfect addition to any household! She is spayed, up to date on vaccinations and preventatives and is microchipped.\n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $350 which includes routine vetting and spay/neuter.\n\n***Please note that our first step is submitting an application (it does not commit you in any way but allows us to discuss with you if you and the dog are a good fit). In addition, an important step in approving adoption applicants is to complete a vet check. Vetting of current and past pets is very important to us, thus we will be speaking with the vet(s) listed on your application to ensure that your current and previous pet(s) are kept up to date on vaccines (including rabies), spayed or neutered, maintained on appropriate monthly preventatives and examined annually by your vet.***\n\nTo complete an online application, please click here and email Crystal at cwoodlovepaws@gmail.com\n\n**If you're viewing this on Petfinder, please visit www.lovepawspg.org to complete our non-binding application.**",

I have a lot to offer, and I want to show off what a great dog I am.  I am smart and I LOVE water. I love other activities, too, like playing tug or tossing around squeaky toys. When I get to know my special human friends, I will be their BFF forever! As a matter of fact, I'd rather have human friends than animal friends. I'm just not a fan of other dogs or cats at all.  I am housetrained and I keep my kennel here clean.  I haven't had much exposure to children, so I'm thinking a home with kids more in their teens might be a good place to start. I'm 47 pounds of pure adorableness!",

If you have any questions regarding one of our Mastiffs, please read their bio and if you still have questions- drop us an email at info@greatplainsmastiffrescue.org . If you have questions about our adoption procedures, please go to our Pages of Interest on the left hand column under 'Adoption Info.' We answer email inquiries almost immediately-usually always within a few hours and phone calls are returned with 24-36 hours.\n\nGPMR does not have a shelter. All of our dogs are kept in loving foster homes. We must have a completed adoption\napplication on file before meeting any of our mastiffs.\n\nGPMR adopts to the states of Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, Arkansas, Missouri, Louisiana and parts of Colorado.\n!!!Any mastiffs being adopted out of the state of Oklahoma require a health certificate to be paid for by the adopter!!!\n\nMeet Sierra! This girl found herself in need of rescue when her owner was not able to provide for her medical care. She had scheduled a vet appointment to put Sierra down, but her family asked her to try and find someone to take Sierra instead and get her vet care completed. A good samaritan took her in to prevent her from being put down and right away reached out to Rescue for help! Sierra came to us with a very large tumor on her tail. It was bleeding and quite infected. Unfortunately the only way to remove it was to amputate her tail. She made it through surgery with flying colors and feels so much better now that is taken care of. Thankfully Sierra tested negative for heartworms! Unfortunately about a week after the first surgery, Sierra chewed her stitches out and required a 2nd surgery. About 3 days after that, the stitches failed and fell out, requiring a 3rd surgery! Poor Sierra! She did great through all of her procedures but the day after that third one, she had some kind of reaction and ended up in the ER two days in a row. Her face and legs all swelled up and she had hives on her neck and feet. We never really determined the cause of the reaction, the ER vet said she could have cancer somewhere in her body, or it was a reaction to one of the medications she is on, or a possible autoimmune disorder, or most likely a negative response to having to receive 3 surgeries in an 11 day timeframe.Sierra is on the road to recovery, her tail nub is healed up and her bloodwork is about back to normal. She lost 10 pounds during this whole ordeal and we are working on getting that back on her. Her appetite is great and she is in good spirits!Sierra is 6 years old and is AKC registered. She is showing signs of arthritis and is slow in her hind end when she gets up and down. We've started her on some medications and joint supplements to keep her comfortable. She is a very strong girl and so keeping her lean and providing light daily exercise will go far to prevent her arthritis from progressing too quickly. A home without stairs would be best for her. A couple of stairs to get in and outside is fine but going up to a 2nd story of a house is not ideal for her. Sierra is doing fine with the Mastiff in her foster home and seems to do well with medium-large size dogs. She is reported to chase anything small, so no small dogs, cats or outside pets like chickens for her. She is good with kids and loves every person she meets. She is such a sweetheart and a true velcro Mastiff - she just wants to be wherever her people are!Sierra is being fostered in Edmond, OK.Save a Mastiff...Adopt, Foster, Volunteer!",

I have pretty low energy and I'm a guy that generally likes to keep to myself and stay out of trouble. My favorite thing in the world is getting scratched behind the ear so if you're looking to make a good first impression, that's the way to do it! I love to play with all other dogs, both big and small. Small children tend to make me nervous so an adult-only home would be preferable. I'd be a good choice for a first-time dog owner looking for a mellow dude to spend their time with. I think I'd be happiest if I could have a great big yard to run around and play in, but I would still prefer to live a quiet lifestyle with my new family. I can be a little bit protective of my territory sometimes so that's something that I would like to work on. I require some further training but I pick up on things quickly. I have been working on my leash manners and have been doing quiet well and now I love to go on long leashed walks around the ranch.",

Monty is 9-10 month mixed mutt Rescued from Fresno SPCA as a stray so we don't know much about his life prior   \n\nMonty is about 58 lbs and may grow to to 65-70 lbs.\n\nMonty is already amazing in so many ways: Loving to people he knows, very well-behaved, knows basic commands (sit, down, shake), treat motivated, eager to please, no food aggression, travels well in the car, walks well on leash, loves other dogs, fine being left alone without complaint.\n\nHowever, Monty needs a VERY specific and VERY special home due to stress triggers / fear-based aggression with NEW people.\n\nInterestingly, Monty has done well meeting new people on our ranch when he is off-leash and able to \u201cescape\u201d as he sees it. He is either indifferent to people or will greet them quickly with loose body tail wags and then quickly move on. Out and about in the community off leash he is neutral to people and non-reactive in general (although VERY interested in squirrels and birds\u2026 the hound mix in him we think!) \n\nWhen extending a meeting w/ a new person, and/or having Monty on leash, he has growled, snarled and lunged at multiple people unprovoked if they acknowledge him. The trainers assessment is that this reactivity/wariness of people is specifically if he feels trapped or the interaction is forced. We are currently working on muzzle training, place command, look command, and sit.  If ignored, even when he\u2019s on leash Monty is fine. \n\nThis will require an owner who is very aware of the situations they place Monty in and ability to manage people\u2019s interactions (please do not pet my dog); putting him away when people come over. There are so so many wonderful, easy things about Monty that we are very hopeful to find the perfect understanding, capable and skilled adopters to help him. Monty is also able to bond with/love multiple people and lives in a home with three adults + multiple dogs. The dogs help Monty very very much. He would do best in a home with 1-2+ dogs for this reason. No resource guarding of food, treats, toys against dogs in the home!\n\nNeutered, vaccinated, vetted, microchipped and utd on preventatives \n\nSkin scrape negative for mange \u2014 just needs high quality diet and to stay up to date on flea tick meds\n\n$250 adoption donation  w/ $200 training voucher available upon proof of enrollment.",

He is a fairly calm boy who likes to be around his people. He is doing very well in his foster home.\n\nZeus is a smart boy who loves to run and play. He adores other dogs and plays well with just about any dog. He is very sweet with his people and loves affection. He can be a bit sensitive to loud or harsh voices. He needs a moment to sniff you and consider you 'good people' before he will relax around you. Zeus is potty trained and can handle being alone at home for some time if needed. He loves walks and hikes and if you are an active person he will be happy. He is no couch potato.\n\nWe prefer to see him with older kids only (over 14) as we feel that younger children may not be able to give Zeus the space he sometimes needs.\n\nZeus is now updated on all shots, neutered and chipped. His adoption fee is $395.\n\nWe cover the medical to prepare the pet for adoption and the adopt donations go directly to cover those costs and range from $295-$495. Thank you for stepping up to save a life!\n\nTo expedite to meet with this dog, please go to our site at www.savinggreatanimals.org and fill out an application. We look at the first applications to arrive, so we hope to hear from you soon!",

He has shown some food aggression, but we have worked hard to calm him down. He's been aggressive to one of the other un-neutered male Great Pyrenees here, but very friendly and happy with all of the others. He was neutered on Oct29, 2020, so we are hoping he calms down a bit but we still think he should be an only dog.",

The royalty no longer found me useful and exiled me from my homeland.\n\nI was discovered in park by a lovely long-haired maiden.  Ah, the way her eyes glistened in the sunlight...I digress.  She was extremely worried that I would scamper out into the lane and be trampled by one of those automatic wagons. \n\nShe gathered me up and brought me to the magical land of Lucie.  This place is full of other knights and maidens awaiting family suitors to offer a dowry to take them to their homes.\n\nUpon arrival, the lords and ladies took me to the \"leech\" or as you call it \"doctor\".  There it was discovered that I had a lot of muscle atrophy in my leg due to an old injury as a result of one of the many wars I fought in.\n\nI have limited mobility in that leg now, but don't let that fool you by any means.  I am still able to run and play and defend the territory!\n\nAnd do you know what else??  This cloud has a silver lining.  The lovely long-haired maiden that rescued me is now an invaluable volunteer lady here at the magical land of Lucie!\n\nIt would please me greatly if you would come to this land and meet me and the others here.  We are waiting just for YOU!!\n\n*** We strive to ensure our dogs are going to a safe, loving and caring home. Phone interviews are required for all adoptions****",

He absolutely loves to run and play, and he really enjoys being outside and going on walks. He's still in a chewing stage, he really likes his soft chew toys and cow hoofs every now and then. He absolutely positively hates to be snuggled he gets very grumbly.  He also talks a lot!  He's been around cats before, he likes to try and play with them. We think it's best for everyone's best interest that he goes to a home with no dogs, no cats, and no little kids. He\u2019s a lot of dog.  Fenced in yard and someone that\u2019s home a lot to give him the attention and training he needs. He doesn't like to be left alone and some anxiety but has a heavy duty crate that he is getting used to. An active family that has the time and energy to handle Riley is best.  To apply for this handsome boy please fill out an adoption application on our website www.rescueangelssomd.com\nAll dogs receive vet care before adoption, including spay/neuter, age appropriate vaccinations, Heartworm/Lyme/Ehrlichia 4DX snap test, deworming, flea/tick/heartworm prevention, and microchip.  Indoor homes only and we expect all dogs to be family members.  Adoption fee applies and adoption application required.",

This way, we can help determine which will be the best match for you, your family, and your lifestyle with the least amount of stress for everyone concerned.

I'm definitely one of the favorite girls around here, I love to ride in the vans front seat to my appointments at the Vet, and when the kennel staff sings Trixie is my favorite girl, my whole body wiggles and I have the \"pitty smile\".\n\nI came to Corridor with nasty heartworms, I did receive fast kill heartworm treatment on me, and unfortunately it left my heart damaged. So I take medication daily. \n\n***\nPlease apply to foster or adopt online at www.corridorrescue.org\n\nDirect inquiries to: adopt@corridorrescue.org.\n\nThe adoption fee of $225 covers spay/neuter, microchip and current vaccines.\n\nTransport is available and can be discussed on an individual basis.\n\nThank you for considering a rescued former street dog for your next family member",

Elvis would do best in a home without young children.\n\nElvis is available for adoption in Texas only. \n\nAs a small organization, we cannot answer emails about each of our pets.

            "description": "PHOTOS:  Virtually all of our dogs have online PHOTO ALBUMS through SmugMug with LOTS of additional pictures.  Just copy and paste the link below into your browser (or simply type it in) and then search for the dog's \"gallery\" by name\n\n          http://adoptasleddog.smugmug.com\n\nVIDEOS:  In addition to photo albums, almost every dog has a video which will give you a much better \"feel\" for his or her personality.  NOTE:  In the new Petfinder format, it has become quite a bit more difficult to find and to play videos.  Please PAGE THROUGH the photos, looking for a photo overlaid in the center with a \"play\" arrow inside a circle.  This icon is white, so it can be difficult to see. \n In many (most) cases, the video is the last photo displayed as you page through.  Just click on that photo and it will play.  Please make sure you CHECK ON THE PETFINDER VIDEO ICON, above, to see a video of this wonderful dog!  Our videos will include, at a minimum, whatever info we had on the dog upon (or shortly after) his/her arrival into our program.  There will sometimes be video updates as well.  And in every case, our Adoptions Coordinator can be emailed at ADOPTASLEDDOG@AOL.COM to answer questions and provide the most current information we have on the dog.  \n\nNOTES:  Please see video or contact our Adoptions Coordinator at ADOPTASLEDDOG@AOL.COM.\n\nADOPTION DONATION:  $250  Before adoption, all Northern Lights dogs (regardless of whether Petfinder's symbols appear) are spayed or neutered, microchipped, heartworm negative, fully vaccinated and tested/treated for known parasites.\n \nWHAT TO DO IF YOU WANT TO ADOPT THIS DOG:  Email us at ADOPTASLEDDOG@AOL.COM to request an application and get started.  WE DO NOT HAVE AN ONLINE APPLICATION - you will have to request one via email.  We will review your application to determine if there is a good fit between you and/or your family and this dog.  We may suggest another dog or dog(s) if we can offer a better fit in terms of lifestyle, experience, other pets, etc.  A vet check, reference checks, and a home visit will be conducted before an adoption can be considered for approval.  \n \nNORTHERN LIGHTS DOES NOT HAVE A PHYSICAL SHELTER.  We are a nonprofit rescue organization comprised of individuals who open their private homes to foster dogs in need of a second chance..  When fosters are not available, we often pay to board a dog until space is available.  New fosters and donations to pay for boarding are always desperately needed us.  Email us at KATYLIED2@AOL.COM if you are interested in donating or for information on fostering.\n \nFAQ:  For information regarding our organization, as well as adoption policies and practices, please visit our Petfinder Home Page at WWW.NORTHERNLIGHTS.PETFINDER.COM.\n \n \nNOTICE:  In the vast majority of cases, the dogs in our program and rescued from shelters, and Northern Lights has no means by which to collect or verify a dog's history.  We work in concert with our veterinarians, and breed and age estimates are based on a combination of professional input and our collective experience.  Our policy with information acquired prior to acceptance and while the dogs are in our care is that of \"full disclosure\".  It is our goal to ensure the adopter has all available information to ensure the best possible match between the dog and the adopter(s).  If we have identified a behavioral or health condition while the dog is in our care and custody, every effort will be made to correct it prior to adoption, OR the adopter will be made aware of the issue or condition prior to adoption.  Northern Lights' screening process is designed to identify only those adopters who are willing, and have the means, to treat conditions which may occur after adoption, and the adopter will be contractually responsible for doing so. However, Northern Lights' policy is to accept any adopted dog back into the program, at any time, for any reason.\n",

Submit application to meet dog if interested - yes an application is required********\n\nYou can learn more about our rescue and process at www.new2urescue.org or find us on facebook at https://new2urescue.org/adoption/adoption-application/ must be filled out to meet one of our dogs.  You must be 25 yrs of age or older to adopt through us. We are in the Rochester NY area and adopt dogs out to area residents.\n\nElmo is (we are told) a Doxie Bully mix with a touch of Schnauzer who is 2 yrs old.  We don't see the schnauzer in him but his short legs, long body and wide chest match the first two. He is only 31 lbs and looks larger than he is in photos. They also do not show how adorable he really is.\nElmo is a great boy, house trained, does well with the cat and dogs in his foster home, loves to run and play but also cuddle. He tends to bounce when running which is very entertaining to watch. He is a contradiction in one way, at his foster home he is relaxed, easy going, accepting of almost anything, can even take a bone out of his mouth. No aggression.... until a stranger comes into home. He does not like strangers and cannot be trusted with new people in home. He was surrendered as he did bite a visitor who just walked into his prior home. This is being worked on and he seems to be fine given a few minutes to accept new person but must be contained (leash/crate/etc.) when someone new comes into a home and carefully monitored while they are there.  He is amazing and almost perfect except his fear of strangers. For this reason a quieter home (not a lot of people coming and going) is the type of home he needs. Ideally you would have another dog for him to play with. He also needs a physically fenced in yard to safely run and play in.\nIf you are interested in meeting this adorable, goofy boy an application is required - https://www.cognitoforms.com/New2URescues/AdoptionApplication\n\n\nAn application must be filled out to meet any of our dogs, to apply go to \nhttp://new2urescue.org/adoption/adoption-application/ so foster can contact you. We do not have a shelter, dogs are in foster homes.\n\nAll animals are kept in foster homes so there is no shelter for you to visit animal. Please go to https://new2urescue.org/adoption/adoption-application/ if you would like to meet the foster animal or learn more.\n\nAll our dogs have been spayed/neutered; treated for worms; heartworm tested (if age appropriate -7 mths or older); treated for fleas/ticks; microchip; and examined by veterinarian and given age appropriate vaccinations. We take every effort to ensure the health of the animal and you will receive a copy of all vet work performed.\n\nYou can find us on Face Book at https://www.facebook.com/New2Urescue and our main website at https://www.new2urescue.org\n\nNew 2 U Rescue is registered as a New York State Shelter / Rescue. Our Registration No.: is RR033 and we are a Registered Non Profit with a 501c3. We help dogs in need in the Greater Rochester, NY area by taking them in, providing any needed vet care and helping them find a forever home.",

            "description": "Hi! It\u2019s me, Gino!\nGino is a 1+-year old boy that comes from working lines, so he is a high energy Dobe. Like most of our working dogs, Gino is looking for a structured home that is going to work on his obedience training and leash skills.\nGino is a sweet boy that loves to give the \u201cDober-lean. Gino lived with another dog in his previous home, but the other dog was not very nice to him.\nIdeally, he\u2019s looking to be the only dog in the home.\nIn his previous home, Gino has struggled with meeting new people and took a while to warm up so he will require a confident handler who will recognize when he needs space and allow for slow introductions to new people. His new caretakers say that he is a social butterfly and enjoys attention from all the volunteers once he is comfortable with them so we suspect this may be something a new adopter should be aware of once he settles into a new home.\nGino is house broken, and crate trained. He is a high energy boy and will only be placed with a home with older or no children and due to his high prey drive, we\u2019d recommend no cats or dogs, and we require a fenced in yard in a suburban or country setting. We are also requiring that the new adopter sign him up for obedience classes after the 2-week period of settling in.\nDo you think Gino sounds like the right dog for you?

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: 9/21/2020\nReason for being in rescue: from feral colony\nFoster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SC\nSpecial Needs? Cody was neutered on 9/22/20. He is continuing to gain confidence and socialization and is ready for his forever home.\nWeight: 45 lb\nHeight: 18 in\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $200\n\nFence needed? Yes\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Cody needs a very experienced owner that understands shy, undersocialized, or feral dogs. He is not for a first time dog owner and will not be adopted to a home without experience rescuing and helping rehabilitate dogs. Cody requires another confident dog in the home. It does not matter what size - he needs a confident canine buddy to follow, learn from, and model behaviors. Cody will not be placed in a home with children. Sudden movements and loud noises make him very nervous. He needs a quiet, consistent, patient environment.\n\nCody has never lived in a home. He is clean in his crate and now recognizes his crate as a safe place. Every experience will be new for this boy. If you haven't had experience helping a dog on this type of journey, Cody is not your dog.\n\nWhat is my personality like? Cody has lived his entire life as part of a feral colony. He came to us as a group of dogs whose owners needed help. Their intentions were positive, but unaltered dogs breed easily and it quickly became more dogs than the family could manage, with no time to try and pet or socialize the dogs. Cody has likely never lived in a house. Everything is new!\n\nCody is skittish but curious about humans and how we work. So far he has learned that humans will give him a safe place to sleep where he doesn't constantly have to look over his shoulder. He's learned he won't go hungry as long as humans are near. Now it is time for Cody to learn to love. With caregivers that have been working with Cody for 6+ weeks, Cody will allow human touch. However, he does not come to you willingly and must be coaxed with treats and a gentle leash.\n\nIt should be no surprise that Cody is great with other dogs. Dogs are familiar and offer comfort. Cody needs to be with another dog and needs a dog that is confident that he can follow and learn from. He is okay with cats. He is learning to walk on a leash and doing well with it given he'd never even worn a collar 2 months ago. Cody has a gentle spirit and heart that has so much potential for love and trust. With confidence, time and patience he will make a wonderful pet.\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Very shy and timid\n\nOther tips and tidbits: Cody's estimated birthday is 9/13/2016\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: 9/28/2020\nReason for being in rescue: Lovingly surrendered by owners\nFoster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SC\nSpecial Needs? Lola is up to date on her vaccines, spayed, and looking for her forever farm!\nWeight: 95 lbs\nHeight: 24 in\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $200\n\nFence needed? Yes\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Lola is looking for a farm. This beautiful girl is a working dog and wants a job. Her ideal home is on several acres of fenced land that she can roam with her family. She is good with farm animals and will protect her herd. Lola has a gentle demeanor and would do well with children.\n\nLola does not have good history with cats. She will kill them. For this reason she has not been tested with small dogs and will not be placed in a home with small dogs. She will not be placed in a home with cats.\n\nLola will not be placed as an outdoor dog. Her forever family loves and understands her breed and has the lifestyle to support her heart's desire for plenty of outside time balanced with indoor living.\n\nWhat is my personality like? Lola is a big fluffy dog with a big heart of gold. She has lived her entire life on a farm. Sadly, when new owners purchased the farm, Lola began killing cats. Her heartbroken new owners reached out to Carolina Poodle Rescue for help.\n\nLola is cuddle bug. She adores people, adores attention, and adores being the center of attention. She is great with other big dogs. Lola is in a play group with 6 other large dogs and loves spending hours playing in the fields ever day. Lola is a working dog at heart. She takes very seriously her job of guarding and protecting farm animals and is happiest when she is outside working. She needs a job!\n\nSince arriving in rescue Lola is learning the ropes of indoor living. She is crate trained and now happily and comfortably rests in her crate at night. She has learned sit, but will only perform basic commands if she's in the mood. She will let you leash her, but still doesn't understand why you'd need a leash to be outside walking. Lola marches to the drum of the land she is on and prefers to go with nature.\n\nLola is a gentle giant. Her personality has really started to shine as he has settled into rescue farm life. She is curious, playful, and a regal bundle of love.\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Friendly\n\nOther tips and tidbits: Lola's estimated birthday is 9/28/2013\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

He doesn\u2019t chew.  He\u2019s housebroken and crate trained.  He will ask to go out.  He\u2019s good with other dogs, but does like to hump on them. ? He will stop when corrected.  He enjoys going for long walks, and gets excited and barks when we\u2019re getting ready to go.  We think he would do well with kids but unsure about cats. He is around 9 years old. \nHe does have Cushing\u2019s disease and cancer (poor guy!) which is why we want to ensure he is loved while he is here with us. He has stage 2 cancer so we are thinking he still has 1-2 years left. He is taking some medicine to keep him comfortable but besides that he is a happy and loving dog! \n\nIf interested in adopting please fill out an application form at https://www.shelteredpaws.com/adoption or with more questions please reach out to mandyrupp86@gmail.com\n",

I'm a 14 year-old cuddle bug who enjoys being with you at all times! I came into rescue because my owner passed away, but I really love my foster family and other people I meet. Since coming into DDRTX, I've been treated for mild back issues, had dental surgery, and had a benign tumour removed from my chest. I'm in pretty good shape now, but I tend to be a little itchy. I really enjoy doodling and snooping around and will get into things that I think might have food in them just like a puppy would! I love treats, sitting in laps, and yummy things I can chew on-- especially leather of all varieties! Don't think that because I'm old, I'm deaf. I can hear pretty well, I just don't really care to listen sometimes. You know what I REALLY like? My 13 year old foster brother. I follow him EVERYWHERE. I walk on the leash with him, go in the car with him, am nice to cats with him, and give him kisses because I just adore him. I just think he's amazing and my foster family is surprised at how quickly and strongly I bonded to him! I am pretty well house broken and can use a doggie door, but you have to remember to take me out to potty! I also like to talk to you when I want something... it can a treat, a pet, a hug, a game of tug with a toy.... I do it every night to my human foster brother- BARK BARK BARK! I'm looking for a family who understands that any leather within my reach is game, that I'm way more crafty and spry than you're going to give me credit for (I will find a way on your work desk), and who wants a wonderful cuddle buddy for tv and bedtime.\nLove dachshunds and not ready to adopt or circumstances won't permit having a dog?

            "description": "If you are looking for an agility dog, look no further than Michigan! This girl has hops! Around 2 years old, Michigan is likely a mix of many breeds but we think she's got some Miniature Pinscher and Terrier in her. She diligently cared for her pups but now she's ready to put parenthood behind her for a home to call her very own. Michigan is the absolute sweetest girl who made herself right at home in her foster home (and on the couch!). She knows sit and is very treat motivated. Michigan is also house trained in her current foster home. She can jump very high and easily scale at least a 5 foot fence so shouldn't be left home alone in the yard. She has A LOT of energy in a small package and will need an active home with a yard and either an equally playful dog friend and/or someone looking for a new running buddy. Once she gets her zoomies out, she is quite content to sleep and cuddle for a few hours. Michigan loves to play with kids but can get a little mouthy when excited. She gets along with other dogs and enjoys playing with them at the park. She is a total cuddlebug and eager to please. If you are interested in meeting Michigan or any of our dogs or puppies, please submit an adoption application on our website. If you have adopted from us before or are already approved with an adoption coach, please reach out to your coach for the next steps. This information is as up to date and accurate as possible for the dog in its current environment. All dogs and puppies will need time and training to adjust to their new surroundings and to learn the rules of their new home. If you are interested in meeting one of our dogs, the first step is to complete the Adoption Form on our website at www.labsandmore.org and take some time to review our adoption process. Your adoption includes the spay or neuter, current vaccinations, microchip, and other services provided while in our care. The safety and health of our puppies is priority one, so we only allow approved applicants to meet and handle puppies. Please understand everything we do is for the dogs and conducted by our kind and generous volunteers. We rely solely on donations, and we do not profit from a dog's adoption. Labs and More is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that operates on donations and time dedicated to this cause by volunteers. Your adoption will save the life of future dogs in need. Labs and More makes no guarantees regarding the behavior, breed, or age of the dogs in our care. Although we strive to provide necessary medical care to dogs in our care, we cannot predict future or current medical needs whether they were symptomatic or not at the time of adoption.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue. Please take a moment and go to www.labsandmore.org and click on Adopt to complete our online dog adoption application. If you have any questions email us at doginfo@labsandmore.org or call us at 858-273-5386. Thank you for looking to a rescue group to fulfill your dream of adding a new dog to your life!

            "description": "Jane is an incredibly sweet, silly, derpy Bull Breed mix who is looking for the right home. She promises to entertain you with her endless hilarious antics, snuggle and watch movies and probably douse you in kisses. She is an absolute ham, that anyone would be lucky to have as a companion.\nShe is wonderful with people, but can be dog selective as we've realized with more dog greets. She does not like all dogs she meets, and therefore we are asking that she go home as an only dog or with only one male dog who she meets beforehand. She is a no for cats, no exceptions will be made.\nJane is a very hyper and high drive dog, who has a lot of love and life to give. She knows basic obedience, is crate trained and crates on command, is potty trained and is the biggest love you'll ever meet. We are asking for no small children, as she has no idea of her size and hyper ness and would knock a child over but she loves older children and thinks they are meant just for her.\nJane comes with free training and we would like a family who will attend these, as it's important she stays mindful. With her hyper nature and pickiness towards other dogs, this is very important. Jane will be spayed, vaccinated and chipped before leaving. Please message the page or text 775-303-8364 to meet Jane.Our dogs are spayed/neutered and utd on shots before adoption unless medically not advised by our Vet.",

If approved we will reach out to you at the point. \n\nLook at this big, happy, handsome Fluff! Need a sweet snuggle boy to make your life complete? Here he is....meet Joey Big Fluff! Joey's here to please! Want laughter? He's goofy! Want love? He's a big teddy bear! Want kisses? Pucker up for Joey Big Fluff! Want hugs? Paws on shoulders and up he goes.... OK hold it he does need to learn not everyone appreciates him jumping up! \n\nJoey BF loves other dogs, his people, car rides, playing, his toys, your toys and all toys. So if you have toddlers who won't pick up their toys this is not the right dog for you....one more thing he needs to learn is leave it for guarding issues! He is great with older children though! Joey Big Fluff is AMAZING and has the sloppy kisses, hugs and snuggles to prove it. Joey loves to play with medium size dogs and up but small dogs are not a good match. Also no cats please. \n\nWant to hear more information, meet him in person or see if he's still available? Don't waste time inquiring just fill in an application on our website www.nalarescue.org, so you don't miss out!!!",

Chocolate has lots of energy also and may be too much for younglings (Under 6). She would be an amazing running / hiking partner. If you are an active person she will definitely fit! She loves playing in water and swimming too! Toys are her favorite! Chocolate knows some basic commands but is a bit stubborn when worked up but listens well.

On intake he was pretty hard to handle. Crazy over cats, he was a food guarder, alligator rolled on leashes, just not a easy case to place. \n\nHe had found himself in the local shelter after breaking free from the chain he lived his whole life on...He wasn't reclaimed.\n\nWe have worked with him a lot!\n\nWe think he is now ready for his forever home.\n\nBecause we know how his past was we will not place him with smaller animals or small children.\n\nNow that we got that out of the way I wanna tell you his awesome points! He is a big love bug!! Snuggles is himz faaaavvvooorite! He is a beefy lowrider. He is in great health! Good for the bath(for the most part ?) Fully vetted! He is treat motivated! A quick learner!  Not a barker. And OMG he is so cool looking and handsome! He does get a long with most other dogs. Meet and greet neccesary.\n\n",

He is very friendly and is house trained and is proficient on the steps.  He is crated while his foster family is at work.

I have been at the Agoura Animal Care Center since October 22, 2020. \n\nLobo so deserves a new beginning!?\n\u2022\n8 year old Lobo arrived from our Downey Animal Care Center back in October. We suspect he didn\u2019t receive the best care with his prior family??\n\nWhen he came to the care center, he had severely  infected ears so we have been treating them and he's feeling so much better now.  Despite his rough living in the past, he remains a very happy boy!   \n\nHe adores humans, walks well on leash, enjoys a stuffie, likes to play fetch, is very affectionate.\n\nHe is a glutton for attention and appreciates being brushed, & loves a stuffed kong. At first, he was very unsure about going into our real room...we\u2019re guessing his past 8 years have been spent mainly living outside, but he's definitely getting better! \n\u2022\nWe\u2019d love to find Lobo an indoor home  where he can become a beloved family member. Best placement would be a home with older children (MS age & up), a calm large dog companion could also be a consideration. \n\u2022\nTo meet our sweet senior Lobo please email agoura@animalcare.lacounty.gov (Please include your contact number).",

Hansel needs a home with a fence and plenty of room to run and smell with that beagle nose! Hansel is working on house training and some basic manners. If you would like to make Hansel a part of your family, fill out an application at www.barktownrescue.org.\nHANSEL'S ADOPTION FEE IS $170The shelter software system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of our dogs we are only guessing at the dog's predominant breed or breed mix. We strongly encourage you to select your new pet by looking at each dog's individual personality and pet qualities rather than relying on a breed label that is only our best guess.\n\nOur adoption fees vary from $150 and up. All of our dogs are up to date on vaccines, heart worm preventives, and flea/tick medication, and will be spayed/neutered prior to adoption. Portions of your adoption fee also help care for the sick and injured animals that we take in. Thank you for supporting us and considering a rescue dog!",

Australian Cattle Dog mix who was found as a stray in rural South Carolina before taking his freedom ride up to Connecticut to find his happily furever after! He\u2019s now in a foster home waiting to find a loving and active family.\n\nThis handsome boy is curious, playful, and as affectionate as can be! He loves to give kisses and enjoys cuddling and being next to his people. His favorite activities involve hiking, ball playing, belly rubs, and couch snuggles. Like many cattle dogs, Jesse is very loyal and smart. He can be timid upon first meeting so a calm and quiet household is required. Jesse is an active pup who loves to run so a fenced in yard is also a must. He would prefer a home with no other pets.\n\nHis adoption fee is $300 and Jesse is up to date on vaccines, microchipped, heartworm negative, and neutered. If you are interested in adopting this sweet boy, please complete the application at form.jotform.com/200883908893166. For questions, please email info@happilyfureverafter.org.",

With the help of each other you can spread your wings and soar! Unlike most birds this lady is as quiet as a mouse. Byrdie is housebroken and looking for her furever home to grow, learn, and love in. Her foster mom says she comes out of her shell more and more every day and is a total sweetheart. Apply for Byrdie today!\n\nByrdie is about 2 years old and weighs about 68 pounds.\n\nIf you're interested in meeting Byrdie, please visit our website to learn about our adoption process and to fill out an application, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nAll of our dogs and cats will be micro-chipped, spayed or neutered, and up-to-date on vaccinations at the time of adoption. For more photos of Byrdie, follow us on Facebook Gateway Pet Guardians and Instagram @gatewaypets ... #gpgByrdie. \n\nTo view other adoptable pets from our shelter, please visit, www.gatewaypets.org/adopt\n\nGateway Pet Guardians is proud to offer a variety of mixed breed dogs available for adoption. However, please keep in mind that we rarely know the genetic background of the animals we rescue and, as such, we cannot guarantee the exact breed combinations found within this dog. However, we do not know his/her actual genetic makeup. Just know that this dog is probably a variety of several different breeds that have combined to create one very amazing and unique animal.",

She is spayed, current on vaccines and microchipped.\n\nLady's adoption application can be found at this link: https://petstablished.com/public/search/pet/156759\n\na note from her foster mom... \n\nAs I sit and watch Lady play in the backyard with her current playmate, one of many of her playmates that have come and gone while she remains in foster care, I wonder why no one is willing to take a chance on her. Shes such a happy, bouncy loving girl. Its been 2 years since Lady came to us from the local over-crowded kill shelter. Still, she waits for a family of her own.\n\nLady isnt unique in appearance, she doesnt stand out in a crowd, shes not a puppy, shes not a tiny lap dog, she isnt even fluffy. She does take a couple of treats (shes highly bribable!) to get comfortable with people she doesnt know, mainly men. She doesnt care much for strangers crowding her when shes in her crate, but who would? Lady is incredibly loving and loyal. She loves with her whole heart. Shes got to be one of the most deserving dogs that has come through our doors. Still, she waits.\n\nLady sits, she lays down, she rolls over, shes crate trained and 100% house trained. Still, she waits.\n\nLady has a beautiful playful nature, she loves to play chase with her playmates. If she is alone she doesnt mind grabbing a toy and playing by herself. Sitting and watching her as she tosses a toy for herself and happily retrieves it to toss around some more is one of the most adorable things Ive ever seen. She absolutely loves stuffed toys. She gently carries them around, cares for them and takes them to bed with her. Its absolutely adorable. Still, she waits.\n\nWhile our beautiful bouncy girl has a couple of easily workable quirks, she has still been looked over time and time again. She watches as so many other dogs come and go. On to their forever families filled with love. Lady wants nothing more than the same for herself. We want nothing more than the same for her. Still, she waits.",

Doctors have told me I have a megaesophagus. This means I have trouble swallowing food because my esophagus doesn't work right. As long as I eat sitting up, I can be a happy and healthy puppy. But the awesome folks with CARE can go over all of that medical stuff. All I know is I love people, dogs of all sizes, cats, and snuggles. I'm crate trained and mostly housetrained. I totally recommend submitting an application to learn more about me!!",

            "description": "Yabba-dabba-do, this duo is for you!! Meet Betty & Barney, a precious mother & son bonded pair of one and two-year-old, 55 lb. pitties. Found as strays, they sadly ended in a kill shelter. With only hours remaining, Happily Furever After Rescue scooped them up just in time!! These cuties are ready to start their next adventure up north in Connecticut. \n\nBetty (F) and Barney (M) are an inseparable pair who LOVE to snuggle and play! You can find them chasing after one another in the yard, lounging in the sun, or giving each other kisses. They're such good pups and are house and crate-trained. They presently live in a home with other dogs and are fine with them. We do not recommend a home with cats or young children. Kids 8+ potentially ok. You MUST have a fenced yard to be considered for their adoption.\n\nCurrently they're available to foster, adopt, or you can choose to foster-to-adopt. They are extremely bonded so they MUST go to a home together, no exceptions. Betty & Barney's adoption fee is $400 total and they are up to date on vaccines, microchipped, heartworm negative, and altered. Six months ago Betty had undergone heartworm treatment and is now also negative. If you are interested in adopting this sweet pair, please complete the application at form.jotform.com/200883908893166 or email info@happilyfureverafter.org.",

He was found in a rural area as a stray. This young boy is the whole package! He is house trained, knows some basic manners, crate trained, and is friendly with other dogs and cats. LEGO likes kids, but it is important to keep in mind with kids that LEGO is a herding dog. His breed by nature is to herd. He is mouthy and can try to nip heels to \"keep you in line\". These behaviors can be overwhelming for small children. LEGO needs a home with a FENCED YARD to give him a place to exert some of his energy and an active family! He is not just some couch potato! LEGO would love another playful dog to be in his home!\n\nBreed experience is highly recommended due to LEGO's classic Catahoula traits! This breed is familiar with hard work and long days! Their stamina is high and needs a \"job\" to keep them busy and their mind from wondering to destructive behaviors. This breed needs a firm owner to keep them on task and provide a challenging environment full of enrichment activities, both physically and mentally.\n\nWe are a 100% foster-based rescue and all of our dogs live in approved foster homes. We are dedicated to finding the best Forever Homes, and will perform home visits and conduct veterinarian and reference checks for each potential adopter.",

            "description": "Meet Jazzy!! Jazzy's shelter name was Jazz, and the handlers liked the name, so they decided to keep it, but make it just a little well jazzier!! So Jazzy it is! Jazzy had been a shelter dog more than once - that's just so sad. She was owned by someone who developed health problems and couldn't care for her, so she was relinquished to the shelter. She was adopted again, and\n...\n\nnot long after that, came back in much worse condition than she left. She was tethered in the second owner's front yard, she had significant hair loss, and was underweight - the note was made that it appeared as though she had not eaten in several days. She was treated for her skin condition, and she gained some weight. She developed an upper respiratory infection and was treated, and she gained some weight. She was spayed and recovered, and gained some weight. All in all, this not-so-little girl gained 23 pounds at the shelter, and is more than slightly rubenesque!! We think she was eating her food, and as much of everyone else's food as she could - poor thing probably just couldn't get past feeling so very hungry!\n\nWe were drawn to her sunny disposition, so we temperament tested her, and we were thrilled when she passed!! After 185 days in the shelter, she was finally going to get to leave!! This chubby girl (we will work on her weight!!) is a sharpei / pit mix, with a golden brown coat, and smiling face. She does love so very much to give kisses - and we have the pictures to prove it!! She is extremely playful, and loves to engage in toy games with her people.\n\nWant to help us make sure that the rest of Jazzy's days are full of fun, without any chains or missed meals? Put your application in today - www.caninecellmates.org!\n\nJazzy is located in Atlanta, GA and is available for adoption immediately. Jazzy is spayed, microchipped and up to date on all her shots. Canine CellMates dogs are trained in items similar to the Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. They learn basic obedience and commands such as sit, down, stay, go to place, and leave it. They are also crate trained. If you are interested in adopting Jazzy, please fill out an adoption application at www.caninecellmates.org. or email adopt@caninecellmates.org for more information.\n\n1/1/21 6:20 PM",

            "description": "Introducing OLIVER, a very easy going, relaxed, \"gentleman\" seeking his forever family and home. Oliver is around 10 years old and currently weighs 25 pounds; we think he is a Jack Russell Terrier mix. Oliver is a very sweet boy who deserves a quiet home with an adopter who has a lot of love to give.\n\nOliver really enjoys having his head, snout, and belly rubbed. He loves to sleep and snuggle in a blanket on the bed or couch. Oliver is not really interested in playing with other dogs, but he's perfectly fine living with them. He'll play with a toy or bone for a short period of time, but loses interest after a little while; Oliver's more into people than other dogs or toys. But, he does enjoy going for walks. He does love treats and eats well.\n\nBecause Oliver is older and he has a little arthritis in his back end, he is not appropriate for young children who would try to lay on or be rough with him. This sweet dog gets a bit anxious when his foster mom leaves the house - but it's totally understandable - so he needs an adopter who is home most of the day. Prior to his rescue, Oliver was abandoned on a back porch of his home for a month when his family moved out and away. Despite this horrible trauma, Oliver is doing very well in foster care.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATIONS are available by request at acaringplace@comcast.net The adoption fee for Oliver is $250. Oliver is in good health and is fully vetted, had a senior blood panel run (no concerns) and has been neutered and microchipped; he does have a condition where one of his is small and shrinking but it is not painful nor life threatening. A Caring Place - All Breed Dog Rescue adopts throughout the Greater Chicagoland Area. All dogs and puppies live in foster homes, providing you as the adopter, with information on the animal's behaviors, needs, and requirements. We are always in search of fosters care providers. If you are one of those special people willing to open your heart and home to an animal in need and would like to receive information on how you can foster an animal, please contact us.",

A mean little bugger but after coaxing him with treats and patience he made the typical Chihuahua turn and became my best friend.\nHe still has his moments when he gets put back.in his kennel but otherwise he is a cuddler,  a kisser and he loves to go for walks. He would do best to be an only dog in the home and no young children.\nSpicy is about 4 years old and weighs 10lbs.\nHe was impounded as a stray at a local.kill shelter and due to his attitude, which Experienced Chihuahua owners most likely know all about,  available for rescue only.\n\n\nIf you would like to meet SPICY , please send us a message in order to receive an application.\n\nWe are only able to meet with pre approved applicants after an application was submitted. \n\nHis adoption fee is $ 250 which includes all vaccines, heartworm test, neuter and micro chip",

She is a 14 week old, 14 lb. Blue French Bulldog mix. She is a happy, playful puppy with 'big dog' energy, often playing tumble with her Lab/Great Dane canine friend. Despite the challenges she is working to overcome, she is unstoppable and has such a zest for life! Delilah was born with Spina Bifida and does not have full use of her back legs and is not fully continent. Don't be fooled though, this girl can really move! She plays a mean game of tug of war, and her 'fetch' game is beyond adorable. After her morning meal and play session, Delicious Delilah loves to spend her day relaxing and snoozing on the lap of her foster mom while she works. She is the star of the Zoom meetings!\n\nIt does take some time and patience to care for Delilah, but it's so worth it! You will be rewarded with tons of licks and kisses. And did I mention that she is the best snuggler? She is a love-bug!\n\n\nThank you so much for your interest in adopting a dog from A New Chance Animal Rescue (https://anewchancear.org). We are a 501c3, tax deductible organization. ANCAR is a foster-based rescue, and we adopt within a 90 mile radius of Bedford Hills, NY.  You will find the adoption application here: (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-application/).  All fields on the application must be completed.\nPlease read about the adoption process (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-process/) so you'll know what to expect when you submit.   \n\nOur dogs are in foster care and we do NOT have a shelter or boarding facility. AN APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED IN FULL AND APPROVED BEFORE A DOG CAN BE MET. This is a firm policy. Our busy volunteers are not able to respond to questions about the dog or dog meeting requests in the absence of an application.  We know these dogs very well because they are in foster care. Please read the profiles of the dog(s) you are interested in prior to submitting an application.  If there are specific requirements stated (ie: Fenced Yard or Canine Friend Required) these are included because they are vital to the happiness, health, safety and adoption success of that dog. \n\nWe are only able to save as many dogs as we have foster homes (https://anewchancear.org/foster/faqs/) and resources for. We provide medical care including vaccinations, testing, deworming, spaying/neutering and microchipping before transporting our dogs. We provide all supplies, preventatives and any follow up vet care necessary while they are in foster care. These costs are high and the number of lives we can save is entirely dependent upon donations from people like you.  We do not receive funding from private foundations or government sources. If you can find room in your heart to help us, with any amount, we are truly grateful (https://anewchancear.org/help/donate/). We are a 501c3 organization, so all donations are tax-deductible. It is only through the kindness of supporters like you that we are 'changing lives...one tail at a time' by providing our dogs with 'A New Chance.' (https://anewchancear.org) \n\nThanks so much.",

Priscilla would be a wonderful friend for anyone who enjoys cuddling just as much as going on walks through the hill-country. Come meet this brindle sweetheart today!",

Now he is much more outgoing and energetic. He is starting to show his true self to those who take a few minutes to get to know him. We often do not know their full history when they come to us, but what a sweet guy he will be to those who show him love and support and security. He is hw positive but Homeward Bound will cover all costs of his treatment back to health. His adoption fee is 200.00.~~If you are interested in this animal, you can complete a questionnaire at http://www.hbpr.org/hb-adopt-web.html, email homeward@ellijay.com, contact us on facebook at https://www.facebook.com/HBPR30540/ or call 706-698-4663.Thank you for considering a rescue dog or cat!

Peaches came to us as an unclaimed stray with a very bad case of \u201ccherry eye.\u201d One surgery and some good groceries later, Peaches is all healed up and ready for love! Her eye surgery leaves no lasting affects to her health. Peaches is a patient girl that is easy-going and laidback. She\u2019s the perfect Netflix partner and Instagram model. Peaches is wonderful girl that\u2019s all ready to go home now!\n\n----\nPeach County Animal Rescue is a rescue located in Fort Valley, GA. Our adoption fees range from $250-350+. Although our rescue dogs share a common bond with one another, no rescue story is the same (even when similar). Vetting costs vary depending on their health conditions. All of our dogs are fully vetted: up-to-date on annual shots, spayed/neutered and microchipped with a lifetime registration. We look forward to hearing from you!\n\nIf you would like to send in an application for this dog, please use the link below! https://peachcountyanimalrescueandrehabilitation.org/apply-now-2/",

I am a sweet dog 99% of the time. My foster mom says that I have some guarding issues with toys and that I can be dominant asking for attention. I can be left alone and I am crate trained. I love all dogs and people and I walk very well on the leash. I am a small girl.\n\nWe are looking for an experienced owner able to deal with this issue and train her. Bella is a rescue dog and like all rescues they are not perfect. We need a patient person who will work with her to help her be the best dog she can be. Bella is good with all dogs and can go to an off leash park but with the guarding issue, it would be best for her to be the only dog in the house and without young children.\nFor more information, please contact  Dominique\nDominiquerousselle@hotmail.com\nOnly email please! Only house with a yard please.",

            "description": "Hello \"\"handsome blockhead Ralphie!!!\n\nThis guy is awesome - super playful with other dogs in daycare.. attends daycare at John Gagnon's Pet Resort and has a blast! He has challenges with other dogs on leash and so city living is not for this boy. Fenced yard where he can run and entertain himself is key. \n\nRalphie is used to living with women only and he's proving to us that is all he will tolerate at this point. Someone with breed experience who is open to training could make this happen but a a woman or same sex woman couple would be ideal for this boy. We don't believe children are in his future.\n\nSo yes, he has many challenges but we are willing to help as much as possible with behavior support. \n\nBack Story \nRalphie's mom sadly is not doing well health-wise and is moving in with family - she also has a 14 yo female bulldog that she will be taking with her but she feels in her heart that Ralphie needs a more full life going forward- someone who will take him place, hiking, exercise him more than she can now. She is doing this after a lot of thought and recommendation by her dog trainer as Ralphie is very attached to she and the other dog - he is super protective of them and is a different dog when they around. By moving him she knows he will go on to be not protective and enjoy life as a regular dog, not super protector.\n\nRalphie is currently residing at John Gagnon's where he's doing great. We have volunteers signing up to take him for walks and he does really well when out and about. His mom tells us he's 100% housetrained but he won't bark or give overt signs he needs to go out - you need to learn his signals!!\n\nJohn Gagnon will be personally involved in this adoption to answer any questions you have about this boy - he calls him a rock star and wants to be sure he gets in the very best home possible.\n\nName: Ralphie\nBreed: English Bulldog/Crossbreed\nSex: Male\nAge: 7 years 0 months\nWeight: 60\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\nVaccinations: Up to date\nHeartworm: Negative\nMicrochipped: Yes\n\nBASED ON OUR OBSERVATIONS: \nGood with Children: Unknown\nGood with Dogs: Absolutely\nGood with Cats: Unknown\n\nAdoption Fee: $300.00\n\n\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION:\nInterested in a specific dog, please fill out an application if you are interested in a dog. The number of individual inquiries is overwhelming and we are finding it difficult to respond to each one. We cannot guarantee you will receive a timely response.\n\nPaws New England is a rescue, not a shelter, and as such we do not have our dogs housed in one location - they are in foster homes both in New England and in our southern foster homes. If you're interested in a specific dog, please complete a short online application and you will receive a reply within 48 hours so you can ask questions.\n\nAt present, if a dog is listed on our website, the dog is considered still available HOWEVER, may have applications that have come in before yours but it's still too early to know if any are a good match; therefore we encourage you to apply.\n\n\nNOTICE WITH REGARD TO LOCATION OF DOGS: Please note: Paws New England is a foster-based rescue. We do not have a brick and mortar building to house the dogs we rescue. We have found that dogs in foster homes are much more adoptable because they have been observed in a home setting. Dogs listed with Paws New England typically reside in various locations throughout the south (primarily Tennessee, Texas, and Arkansas) and New England (not necessarily in the state of Rhode Island). You will be notified by the adoption coordinator of the location of the dog you are interested in so you have the ability to decide whether to pursue adoption or not.\n\nDogs transported to New England are done so at a fee of $150.00 paid directly to the transporting company by Paws New England; no additional transport costs are responsibility of adopter. This fee is included in the adoption donation.\n\nAdoption donations cover pre-adoption vet costs (including vaccinations, spay/neuter when age appropriate, and heartworm testing/treatment when necessary), a microchip, and transportation to New England if necessary.\n\nDonations for our young, healthy puppies and dogs support their fellow canines of advanced age or suffering from injuries and abuse whose donations are reduced but whose veterinary costs are typically much higher. We appreciate your understanding that your dog will help others in need.\n\nAll known information about the animal is listed above. We do our best to give accurate information, but most of our dogs are rescues and do not come with a known history.\n\nPaws New England abides by the dog importation regulations set forth in the states of MA, CT, NH and RI.",

His front leg and his hip were injured. He had FHO surgery and his leg is mending.  All that's left for Gus to do is heal and gain strength in the coming weeks. Gus is between 1 and 2 years old and his weight is about 70 lb. He is a striking boy. He has a sparkling personality and loves company.  He is good with other dogs but not cats. Gus knows a few commands and is eager to please. He enjoys playing with his toys and would love to have a canine sibling to call his own. Although we feel Gus would enjoy smaller children, he is young , extremely playful, not to mention a big dog and most likely would play to rough for a small child or elderly person. It should also be known that he has a typical Shepherd personality and will be on guard with strangers. A slow meet and greet is recommended for new folks. Once he accepts you he will be loyal, playful and happily social. \nHe is living in foster care with other dogs. He is housebroken and fairly well mannered in the house. His activity should be fairly low for the next few weeks until his hip is fully recovered.\nIs fee is $150 plus tax. Applications are required. Contact Laurie with inquiries. Intheyellow@yahoo.com",

Well, for me, Stormie fits me perfectly as that has been what my life has been like up until coming into rescue. My beginning story is not very well known, but I was found last winter during a sub-zero, stormy, winter night tied to a pole outside the shelter. I spent the next 10 months living in the shelter scared and so shy of people and my environment. No one ever came to claim me, but the hopes were small due to being tied up outside. I was passed over by a lot of rescues because of being so scared, but Unbreakabull saw me and took a chance, and I have not disappointed. Despite my name, I am the sweetest girl that you will ever meet!! I am 3 years old, and I absolutely love other dogs. I love to play with toys as well. I am doing great on my leash when I go for walks, but I will try and chase anything that is small like squirrels and birds that I can see, so we think that it\u2019s best that I not be around cats. I currently live with 2 other dogs, and I absolutely love them! I do great when playing with them, and I even enjoy some random snuggle time. I am still a little hesitant when it comes to new people and will act shyly and be very nervous around them. I am protective of new people coming into my space, but once I get comfortable around people, like my foster family, I settle in a little more. I am going to need someone who can take things slowly with me. I got to experience a new snow fall, and I loved running around in it and trying to eat it! Apparently being left out in the cold didn\u2019t affect my desire to enjoy the white stuff that came from the sky. Due to be still so nervous around people and sounds and quick movements, it\u2019s best that I be with children that are a little older and can understand that I just need time to warm up to them and that I don\u2019t like sudden things happening. I don\u2019t bite or growl, I just get anxious and scared. I know how to sit, shake with BOTH paws, and I am learning to stay and wait for whatever I am being asked to wait for. Usually it\u2019s a treat, so I don\u2019t mind :) . While my life may have started out as a storm, all that I currently see is the rainbow that comes after the storm in the quiet. If you think that you could be my lifetime rainbow partner, please head on over and fill out an application so that we can meet. Until I get to see you, I\u2019ll keep working on getting some more treats and building my confidence. Always rainbows, Stormie (UPDATED 12/23/20)\n\n\nToo see more pictures and videos of me visit my page at \nhttps://www.unbreakabull.com/stormie\n\n\n",

He has lived with dogs from 6-80+lbs, and size doesn't matter, he loves everyone equally. He also does great with cats in the home, but does like to bark at them outside his fence. \n\nChicken does have a deformity to his front leg, but it doesn't slow him down one bit. We are not amputating, as he does have some muscle control over the leg and will sometimes use it to stabilize toys and things. \n\nThis big goof ball has so much love to give, and cannot wait to meet you.

            "description": "Welcome to Grace Rescue, HAYLEY, twenty-five pounds of the sweetest, young, purebred Beagle girl you could ever hope to find! \n\nHayley was rescued from the Olive Branch Animal Shelter and was taken straight to our vet in Olive Branch where she was estimated to be about 3 years old\u2014a truly great age for a Beagle. She is young but is more settled, no hyper puppy energy. Everyone from Nikki, the Animal Control Officer at the shelter, to Dr. Ginny, Haley\u2019s doctor, and everyone in between have declared her the absolute sweetest tempered little dog. She was very cooperative at the clinic. Her bloodwork was \u201cperfect,\u201d Dr. Ginny\u2019s word, except for being,  understandably, slightly anemic. Fortunately, she has no intestinal parasites. She has infected skin around her neck,  but absolutely nothing we cannot fix. She will look like Miss Doggie America when Dr. Ginny works her magic. \n\nHayley is walking well on leash, thanks to training she is receiving from Michelle at our vet clinic. She is still a bit timid, but that too will improve with time as she trusts us more and more. \n\nHayley is being fostered through heartworm treatment by a family who has been approved also to adopt Hayley. The reason she is listed as \u201cadoption pending\u201d is because we never finalize an adoption of any of our dogs while they are undergoing heartworm treatment. Her foster family loves her and has every intention of adopting her as soon as she completes treatment. We encourage you, however, to visit our full Petfinder site and see ALL the precious Beagles we have available. We welcome your applying to foster-to-adopt one of our available Beagles, already in various stages of vetting. Please visit also our rescue Facebook page where we post updates, pictures, and videos of all of our dogs. Petfinder limits us on the number of pictures and videos we can post. Facebook does not. \n\n",

She gives the most sincere eye contact you can imagine, and it is clear she is sending you her love. Diamond is a straight-up people person.  She had a rough start in our Pups on Parole program. The minute she arrived, we had to send her out for exploratory surgery, not knowing if she would live or die. Luckily, her issue was completely resolved. She is healing and on a low activity regimen, so there are things we haven\u2019t been able to learn about her yet. She was surrendered to the local shelter for being an \u201cescape artist.\u201d We suspect, from observing her gentle temperament, that in actuality she was not getting enough human attention. Her handler reports her as being a medium energy dog who is great on a leash, mainly because his (YOUR) company nearby is what Diamond most wants.  She  is house-broken. Diamond has spent telling lengths of time unattended in areas where she easily could have done damage, but instead she waited contentedly for her handler to return.  She is not a destructive chewer. She listens to and accepts verbal corrections. At this point, being unable to test Diamond out with our resident cat, we are going to recommend against adopting her to a home with cats. We think she would be great with kids. She weighs about 50 pounds. This girl needs a home where they need her as much as she needs them. If you think Diamond could be your FOREVER dog please use the information below to inquire. To get more information on a Pups On Parole dog, please contact a representative of the Lassen Humane Society at 530 251-7247 or e-mail ilovepopdogs@yahoo.com.  The Pups On Parole Program started in June of 2007 to help give homeless dogs a second chance at finding an adoptive family.  All dogs in the program spent time in our local county shelter, surrendered by their owners or picked up as strays and waiting for their owners to redeem them or to be adopted by new families.   The selected dogs are brought current on vaccinations, spayed/neutered if necessary, micro chipped, and heart worm tested.  They then are taken to the California Correctional Center Firehouse where they are assigned to a trainer/ inmate fire fighter.  These trainers groom and work with each dog and give them the extra time and attention they need to become wonderful family companions.   Most graduates are house trained and know basic obedience commands.  As of December 2018, 535 dogs have been adopted through this program.  To meet any of the Pups On Parole dogs, arrangements must be made in advance.",

Those do not slow him down! Wyatt has found the joys of living in a home and spends most of his days snoozing on a big pillow with all 4 long legs in the air and a grin on his face. He loves his foster sisters and would be best in a home with other dogs. Wyatt is still timid with people but is very gentle and loves scratches. Older children and a quiet home would make Wyatt most comfortable but he does well in his crate when strangers are around. Wyatt is a pretty quiet boy unless the chihuahua next door is out or the vacuum is running. Wyatt is easy to love and would make a furever family very happy.\n\nWe believe Wyatt is an Akbash mix.. He must have a home with secure private fencing as he can climb over small fences. \n\nBlrescuetexas@gmail.com for information on Wyatt - Bigloverescue.org for an application\n\nAn approved application must be on file before meet and greets can be scheduled. \n",

            "description": "Lulu Belle is a tricolor female Beagle mix that grew up in a tough part of town.  Besides the elderly man that took this girl under his wing, the other neighborhood residents were not very kind to her.  Lacking resources to properly care for Lulu Belle and fearing for her safety, he reached out to us for help.  Fortunately, we were able to bring her into our rescue recently and she is doing quite well.  At first, Lulu Belle was understandably wary of volunteers.  It has been a journey gaining her trust.  With patience and love, our volunteers showed her not all people were bad and soon won her over.  This girl has really blossomed over the past few weeks and is now ready to be adopted.  Lulu Belle is approximately one and half years old, medium in size, and has been fully vetted.  She would make a wonderful companion for someone that is home most of the day.  Lulu Belle would do best if she had another confident dog to bond with.  She tends to be anxious and fearful of children because of prior abuse suffered at their hands.  Older children that are dog savvy and respectful would likely gain her trust.  She is fond of some of our teenage volunteers.  LuLu Belle will need a fenced in yard at her new home.  She is not accustomed to leashed walks but does enjoy playing and running outdoors. Lulu Belle prefers going on grass and is housebroken if kept on a regular schedule.  This girl is a very affectionate loving dog that deserves a second chance. Please consider opening your heart and give Lulu Belle the loving home she so desperately needs.  \n\nTo adopt this pet, Click \"More About Us\" and then \"Adoption Application\" to be directed to our online HSNWGA application form.

He was adopted recently, but had to come back for some behavioral issues that arose in the home. Chance will need an experienced dog owner to help him reach his full potential! He is a very smart man, but it does not seem as though he was taught many skills from a young age. His recent training with a Gentle Leader has proven to help immensely with his overall behavior while interacting with humans. He is making wonderful strides in basic obedience, with SIT and DOWN being his current triumphs! Chance is very food motivated, so training is proving to be easy and FUN! Chance's new home will need to continue using this gentle leader and should also seek training classes, which will help strengthen the bond between him and his new home! Chance would be best in a home as an only pet and with children 15+. His ideal family would be home often, as he does not like being left alone. If you think that you can give Chance the home that he deserves, please visit our webpage www.spfldhumane.org to fill out an application for adoption!\nAdoption Fee: $200 (includes Gentle Leader)\n\nNOTE: WE ARE CURRENTLY ONLY ADOPTING TO VERMONT RESIDENTS.",

Stevie was surrendered by her owner after his wife passed away and he no longer had time for Stevie as she had been his wife\u2019s faithful companion. Stevie is spayed, microchipped, up-to-date on vaccines, and currently being treated for heartworms by slow-kill which consists of 28 days of antibiotics and monthly doses of Advantage Multi until she tests negative or until she is eligible to begin immiticide (injections) treatment. More details on heartworms and treatment options upon request.  She is now with our Second Chance foster, Rebecca V. who says Stevie has been a model houseguest so far. Gets along with her smaller dog?, not a peep overnight in her crate, loves to fetch a ball, and housetrained. Requirements are good vet history, a fenced yard, and a live or virtual home visit. Fee: $200. Apply online: http://secondchancedogrescuela.org/ad\u2026/adoption-application/. Thank you for sharing this pet!",

If you can identify with someone that's been dealt a sad hand but has endured, then Harrison could be your soulmate. Harrison ended up in the shelter with a deformity that visually prevented him from being adopted. OPA provided surgery and he now looks great! Sadly he was a victim of a horrible abuse situation. All of these have made him what he is today - one tough cookie. Harrison is ready to move on and soak up the good life! Harrison has lived with other animals but it would be ideal if he were the only pet in his new home. He does not like cats, livestock or rodents! He loves his caretakers. Harrison walks fabulously on a leash and loves to go on walks. He also does well on car rides.",

Also she eats in very quickly so the foster has changed her to a slow feeder. Foster is looking forward to working with this little girl, teaching her some manners and seeing her grow\n\nSPECIAL NEEDS\n\nShe was surrendered to Veterinary Emergency and Specialty Hospital for medical issues suffering from multiple seizures and extremely thin from consistent throwing up and diarrhea. Akira's labs did not show a reason for her generalized seizure disorder. She has a diagnosis of juvenile epilepsy. Statistically, most likely ideopathic epilepsy that after achieving control on anti epileptic drugs for at least 6 months may begin to very gradually wean off medications( like 4 to 12month weaning period). After her seizure early morning October 21st and starting phenobarbital, she has not had further seizure activity. She will need blood levels checked for phenobarb once or twice and regular checks of those and liver values every 6months while on the meds.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Beau Geste was purchased as a puppy from a breeder in South Carolina, but was surrendered to a local rescue several years later because he was fearful and had a bite history. He was adopted out as an emotional support dog and, although loved, wasn't cut out for the job and his behavior only escalated. Beau can only be placed with a very experienced handler who has no children living in or regularly visiting the home, and they must be very adept at reading dog body language. Beau gets along well with other dogs and dog-savvy cats but has human aggression, and will need to wear a muzzle when near unfamiliar people or teaching new commands. He has been with his foster for more than two months and, while he has shown improvement in many areas, including better restraint in misplaced aggression and cession of human resource guarding, he is still displaying \"nip and run\" behavior. Because of the misplaced aggression, an e-collar cannot be used and any correction (verbal or physical) that Beau perceives as too harsh elicits an aggressive response. Beau has received extensive obedience training, and his foster is currently working on behavior modification, which takes much longer to fix. Beau will need a very special adopter who is 100% committed to him.If you are an approved adopter and are interested in this dog, please let your case worker know. If you are not yet an approved adopter but are interested, please complete an adoption application!\nYou can review our adoption process, www.shenandoahrescue.org/adoption-process if interested.

            "description": "Corky, silly & sweet, ladies & gentleman we're excited to introduce Micah. She's a 4-5 year old #Rottweiler mix. Micah enjoys long walks, spending time with her humans & loves cuddle time. She does okay with other male dogs when properly introduced, but can be selective and it's mainly with female dogs. She's non reactive to cats, but hasn't been up close yet and interacted with one yet. Micah is now officially 100% crate trained and 100% potty trained. We'd recommend no children 10 & under. Although she is great with all people and craves human companionship along with tons of attention, Micah does like her own personal space. She knows all of her basic commands and is just a lover at the end of the day.\n\nAdoption #Requirements: No Exceptions\n- Fenced in Yard Required\n- No kids under the age of 10\n- No Female Dogs\n\nMicah is currently up for adoption through Lending A Helping Paw Dog Rescue. Her adoption fee is $350 & will include her distemper, rabies, bordetella, parvo, & lepto vaccines; deworming; microchip; heartworm test; fecal test & being fixed. Micah is currently on both flea & tick, as well as heartworm prevention. We kindly ask that you please wait until then to ask any questions.\n\n***PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE POST & FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS****\n \nWith the Covid-19 Pandemic going on we are still doing adoptions, but please remember that we are all volunteers and safety comes first. With our rescue being based in the Metro Detroit area, all prospective adopters must live within the state of Michigan (which means No out of state adoptions). Please remember we are not a shelter and are 100% foster based. Once you submit your application, it may take up to 2 weeks for us to get back to you. So please be patient with us.\n\nAgain, we kindly ask that you please read the entire post to answer your questions. If you cannot follow the instructions properly, we will skip your application and move onto the next one. We kindly ask that you save any questions, comments or concerns for the phone interview. We kindly ask the following: No phone calls, No pm's, & No multiple emails- We are all volunteers and promise to get back to you within a timely fashion! \n \nLending A Helping Paw Dog Rescue; previously known as the PRO-PET-OTIC Foundation, is a 100% Foster-Based Rescue that is ran by all Volunteers. Which means that we are not a shelter & each animal is in an actual home with a foster family. We kindly ask that you put any questions within the email & our team of Volunteers will get back to you. With the overwhelming amount of emails please be patient with our 100% volunteer family and we will get back to you. The application MUST BE filled out, a Vet Check MUST BE completed by our team, as well as a phone interview before we do a 'Meet N Greet.'\n \nVet Checks:\nWhen adopting through our rescue, we 'ALWAYS' do a vet check on each applicant's pets that they have owned over the past 10 years. Please make sure to call your vet to grant them permission to release this information to our rescue. That being said, all of the animals in each applicant's home must be UTD on all of their vaccines (DHLPP & Rabies), an UTD Heartworm Test, & currently on both Flea & Tick, as well as Heartworm Prevention. So please make sure that when you are applying that all of your current animals go to the vet that is listed.\n \nHow To Apply:\nIf you're interested in adopting one of our available dogs:\n1. Email LendingaHelpingPaw313@gmail.com with the dogs name as the subject when you ask for the adoption application.\n2. Once you have completed the application, please print it out, fill it out, scan it, & then email it back to LendingAHelpingPaw313@gmail.com. If you do not have a scanner, please take a picture with your phone and we kindly ask that you sent all attachments into one email.\n3. Please make sure to call your vet to grant our organization permission to do a vet check on your current pet.\n4. If you are interested in more than one dog, please list your top 3 choices on the completed application.\n5. Please be honest & truthful on your application. We always do a vet Check. We always do a home visit. And we always have both the prospective families & dogs best interest at heart!\n\nThank you in advance for all of your love & support,\nThe Lending A Helping Paw Dog Rescue Family",

They are about 3-4 years old, super laid back, and although they are heartworm positive, the nonprofit Friends of the Missouri City Animal Shelter has offered to pay for their treatment once they are adopted. These guys are a bonded pair and must stay together, but the shelter is also offering a reduced adoption fee - instead of $110 for each, the fee is $150 total for both dogs. They have been at the shelter for over a month, and their heartworm status makes their situation more complicated, but we are hopeful the shelter is not the end of the road for them. These boys are friendly and lovable and just need a chance at a new life with a forever family. They are not good with cats, but they would be great with any person or family who will show them the love and devotion they deserve. If interested, please call 281-403-8707 to schedule a meet and greet. If you have specific questions about them, you can email mc.rescueme@gmail.com, but we CANNOT schedule appointments by email. You must call the shelter for a meet and greet.",

As is the case with most older dogs, Bodee needed extensive dental procedures. At 12 years old Bodee was left basically toothless, and he now enjoys softer meals. He has an odd walk due to what is suspected to be a birth defect, but it does not hinder his ability to follow his people around. He can be bossy around other dominant male dogs, but he is great with the female dogs in his foster home. Bodee is a great companion and would love nothing more than a lap to call his own. He is a lover! Just look at his eyes and you will see the love he shares!\n\nBodee is spay/neutered, microchipped, current on vaccines, heartworm tested and on prevention. Adoption fee for Bodee is $275. If you are interested in adopting Bodee, please fill out an adoption application http://www.furgetusnotrescue.org/application.html .",

            "description": "Belgium is currently recovering from knee surgery and will be available for adoption in late January or early February. Belgium is just about as sweet as can be! She is a little Terrier mix close to 25 lbs. She came to Labs and More with her 8 puppies. After being the best little mama to her pups, she is finished with motherhood and nearly ready for a home of her own. Now that she's done with her puppies, this little mama is letting her inner puppy out! Belgium is very sweet and gets along with everyone she meets - people, dogs and cats. She does seem to do better with small to medium dogs and avoids larger dogs when she can. Like many Terriers, she does nip at your heels and during playtime, something she is working on correcting in her foster home, but she may not be the best choice for families with small children at this time. She loves kids and does well with older children. She revels in attention and sitting with you on your lap. She will need a family that lets her up on the furniture because she enjoys cuddling on the couch with you. She sleeps on the couch in her foster home through the night but would love to sleep in bed with you instead. One bonus about this girl is she doesn't shed! She is house trained in her current foster home. Belgium is food motivated and is sneaky enough to try to swipe food off countertops. She comes when called, knows what \"no\" means, and has good leash manners. She loves her walks and has medium energy with the occasional burst of high energy zoomies. She would benefit from a home with a yard where she can play fetch, run around to her heart's content, and maybe dig a few holes. She wouldn't mind being your next running buddy for short jogs. This little girl wants to be wherever her people are. She would prefer a home where her humans are home more often than not and work from home. Belgium is an easygoing, always tail wagging, happy little pup that will make a great family dog. If you are interested in meeting Belgium or any of our dogs or puppies, please submit an adoption application on our website. If you have adopted from us before or are already approved with an adoption coach, please reach out to your coach for the next steps. This information is as up to date and accurate as possible for the dog in its current environment. All dogs and puppies will need time and training to adjust to their new surroundings and to learn the rules of their new home. If you are interested in meeting one of our dogs, the first step is to complete the Adoption Form on our website at www.labsandmore.org and take some time to review our adoption process. Your adoption includes the spay or neuter, current vaccinations, microchip, and other services provided while in our care. The safety and health of our puppies is priority one, so we only allow approved applicants to meet and handle puppies. Please understand everything we do is for the dogs and conducted by our kind and generous volunteers. We rely solely on donations, and we do not profit from a dog's adoption. Labs and More is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that operates on donations and time dedicated to this cause by volunteers. Your adoption will save the life of future dogs in need. Labs and More makes no guarantees regarding the behavior, breed, or age of the dogs in our care. Although we strive to provide necessary medical care to dogs in our care, we cannot predict future or current medical needs whether they were symptomatic or not at the time of adoption.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue. Please take a moment and go to www.labsandmore.org and click on Adopt to complete our online dog adoption application. If you have any questions email us at doginfo@labsandmore.org or call us at 858-273-5386. Thank you for looking to a rescue group to fulfill your dream of adding a new dog to your life! Dogs + Love = Family",

The first one completely tells his personality\n\nHe is a goofball, very athletic, trained to a doggie door, does well with other dogs, unknown on cats, may be too much for little kids just because of his energy level. Gordi is super sweet with beautiful markings, maybe some Catahoula in there...? Gordi is ready for his forever home!\nWe require that you have a fenced in yard, not a \"kennel\" in the yard AND we do not approve underground fencing. Depending upon the dog some exceptions are made for those who live in apartments. We also require that the adoptee will be a part of the family \"living\" within the home. Our adoption process may be found on our website at www.bitofheaven.org\n\nVisits are scheduled by appointment only via emailing request to ownedbycaninesandlovit@yahoo.com",

I was take to MCAS as a stray, so nothing is known about my life prior to arrival. I was adopted with one of my friends, Lasso. We were both returned for, apparently, climbing/digging out of our yard multiple times. However, the staff here at the shelter have not had any issues with me escaping. The staff say I am good with other dogs, but no cats or chickens for me please! I am recommended to go home with older children, due to my energy level and I do like to jump up for hugs. I would really like a place to call home, so, please ask to meet me and we will see how we get along. Looking forward to our meet and greet!\n\nLove, Weasel",

I am a good girl, walk well on a leash, love to go for car rides, play ball, or relax with you. I would do best in a home with no small animals and kids over twelve. Don't let that stop you though, I am a diamond in the RUFF waiting for you to come find me! Please know that I am protective of my family and I need someone that will put me in a different secure area when company comes over. Other than that, you will get a real diamond with me. \nIf you would like to see a video of me please go to http://bit.ly/AdoptableDogVideos\nSL # 268240For best response to an inquiry about this animal, please visit www.forestcountyhumanesociety.org, fill out an application and return it to us.

            "description": "This is Mary! She's around two years old with lots of life to live and love to give. This pitbull sweetie is currently getting lots of love in a great foster home while she waits for her forever family to find her. Mary is housetrained, walks well on a leash and knows a handful of commands! She isn't super friendly with other pups or kids, but she's working on it! She's a very affectionate girl who loves cuddling with her people on the couch. As for toys, she really enjoys a good rope or squeaky toy. This girl is the total package - loves to play but loves to be calm with her people, too. As for a home, she would love a family with patience as she gets to know them. She has so much love to give and will be the perfect companion. She would love a backyard to play in and a family who will let her fully participate in their lives - going for walks, on car rides, letting her sit with them on the couch. She just wants a family of her own. Could that family be yours? Apply to adopt Mary today!

            "description": "Please read the dog's entire bio before you apply.  Sadly, we are no longer able to respond to every application, but will contact the one that is a good match within 3 days.\nChief is a male terrier mix, a little 11.5 lb boy who has a ton of wiry black/silver hair and very expressive eyes.   Chief is 3-4 yrs old.   He is shy at first but does want to trust, he just takes a little time.  Chief is not great on the leash yet (too scared) and would need a quiet place to come out of his shell.   He does well with other small dogs and is very respectful with them.  He bonds to one person is the home so a quieter home with just one caretaker is likely best for him.\nMost of our dogs are not available to an out of the area adoption because of difficulty to follow up.  If you do not live within a 2 hr drive of Orange County, please email us before applying to see if the dog you are interested is may be a candidate for long distance adoption.    We only make consider long distance adoptions for dogs who have been in our rescue for 6 plus months with no local candidates.\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our rescues, please visit our main website for adoption procedures at www.pupsandpals.net and then fill out our application.  Please note that we are all volunteers so it may take up to 3 days to process your application, but you will hear back from us if your application is a good match for the pet. \nWe do not have a shelter so individual appointments must be made to meet the pet you are interested in.  Our pets are fostered/boarded all over LA and Orange County.  \nThis pet is altered, vaccinated, microchipped, and has had a brief temperament evaluation to help us determine what type of  a home he/she would thrive in.  Please note that we put lots of time and effort to make sure our pets are ready to be someone's perfect pet before they go home.... and to make sure that we will have the best possible match for this pet we do require an : application, interview, adoption fee and in some case a home check.  \nListed for adoption: 11/2/2020\nAdoption fee: $350\nPLEASE DO NOT call or email to see if a pet is available.  We update our pages daily so if he/she is pictured here in the available dogs section, we are accepting applications at this time.",

            "description": "Angus came to us when we were contacted by the local dog pound about a black lab a citizen had carried in because he was unable to stand.   We first suspected a spinal injury but xrays showed a broken pelvis and hip.  Xrays also showed that his growth plates aren't fused which puts him at big puppy age. \n\nThis sweet guy has healed up well and in just three weeks after we got him, he's up to about 75% of normal activity with only a slight limp which we think will completely vanish when a little more time has passed. \n\nHe took great to crate training.  He wants to please. He fetches some but doesn't seem to have a super high ball drive.  He is not sufficiently house trained to be left alone in the house but he's never had an accident in the house either.   He will try to sneak your shoes into his crate.  He loves toys and always has his tail in a slow wag.\n\nHe gets along great with a senior German Shepherd in his foster home.  He annoys the heck out of our very bold, non fearful cat but hasn't shown any aggression.  He would probably chase after a cat that would run but he's not shown any prey drive.   He has growled at the other dog when he's eating but we've scolded and redirected his behavior and he's responsive. \n\nHe is not likely a purebred Labrador Retriever but he's very \"labby\" in both appearance and disposition.  He's about 60 pounds and really handsome. \n\nAn adoption application and $149 adoption fee is required.",

He loves to play ball, go for nice strolls and is also just happy sitting by your side. He is also quite the charmer...he loves to come up and steel affection and ask for belly rubs. He has a nice, quiet demeanor and you can tell that he was once in a loving home.\n\nWe think Buddha would do well in a home with other dogs, maybe cats and children over 10.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more, please let us know! We would love to find a foster or an adopter! https://happyheartsgsr.org\n\n#dogs #chowchowsofinstagram #chowchow #adoptme #adoptdontshop #fosteringsaveslives #rescuedogsofinstagram #rescuedog @ San Diego, California",

            "description": "Meet Lily! This silly, sweet 6 year old pup and her best friend Jessi are looking for a special home. Both girls have some ongoing medical needs that ARF is taking care of, but they would love a home that offers love, comfy beds, and a great retirement plan. Though Lily is younger, she is definitely the big sister of the two, always looking out for Jessi. Both Lily and Jessi are very friendly with other pups, but Lily is a little skeptical of cats and is known to have a penchant for chasing chickens (though she's never caught one!). Lily can also be just a little shy around new people, but she warms up quickly and will be in your lap in no time! Both girls love to curl up on the couch with you and also enjoy walks (they have great leash manners) and car rides. Lily and Jessi have lived together for many years, and this dynamic duo is ready to find a forever home together. If you're interested in fostering or adopting, fill out an application on our website and we'll be in touch soon!\n\n-----\nIMPORTANT: To protect the health of our staff and volunteers, ARF is currently conducting adoptions by appointment only. Please see more information below.\n\n-Contact Info:\nHave questions first about the adoption process or a particular animal? Please click the Contact this Organization button.\n\n-Ready to Adopt? Please visit www.animalrescuemobile.org to submit an adoption application, or click the Adopt Me button to request one via email.\n\n-The Adoption Process:\nAn adoption application, veterinarian and/or personal reference, a home visit, and a $150 adoption fee are part of the process. All animals will be up to date on shots, microchipped, and spayed/neutered before adoption.\n\n-Please Note:\nSponsors are needed to help ARF with the cost of vet care. If you would like to sponsor an ARF rescue, please click the Sponsor Me button. A sponsor donation of $50 will help cover the cost of a spay/neuter surgery. Plus, ARF is a non-profit organization and all donations are tax deductible.",

            "description": "Update Dec 14 - We just wanted to add a few things we've learned about Charlie since he came to stay with us. We think Charlie spent most of his time in his home and yard as he's very stressed when in new places. Once he's settled into a home he'll be comfortable, but it could take some time to get used to new noises and smells. Charlie is a simple guy and just needs some time in a private yard to play and with the help of a trainer learn to feel less anxious when on a walk. Currently he lunges and barks on walks when he sees a dog so needs to live somewhere he can be walked in quiet areas. \nHe is very interested in squirrels and small critters so not cats for this guy! What Charlie needs is stability and a quiet environment with someone who can help him manage some of his anxiety. We will be looking for a detached home in a quiet area for this boy. \n\n_______________________________________________________________ \n\nCharlie is a handsome gentleman with a very serious face, but a silly personality. This big goof loves toys and happily prances around with them and will fetch...but not return it! Charlie is looking for a family with some dog experience, especially with larger dogs. He'd be happy to go for a walk and then snuggle on the couch!\n\nCharlie was very stressed when he first arrived with us after his owner passed away. He's settled in now and we are so happy to see him so much more relaxed. Charlie was a dog who had a yard to take care of, so he does bark a bit if he hears unfamiliar noises, but we've already noticed he's much quieter. \n\nCharlie is dog reactive, especially when he's behind a fence. He will need to be the only dog in the home, and won't be visiting any dog parks. He walks well on leash, and while he will bark at other dogs, we've also seen this decrease since his arrival. Charlie has not been assessed with cats or small animals. \n\nCharlie is about 8/9 years old and in good health. \n\n\n\nThank you for choosing to adopt an animal! \n\nDue to social distancing we will be doing the initial steps of our adoption process via email/phone and then arrange an appointment to come meet our cats. Please read the bios carefully to see if we have a cat that is a match for what you are looking for. You can then visit www.coquitlam.ca  to download an adoption application. Once complete and submitted we will be in touch!\n*\n*\n*\nAll the animals that arrive at the Shelter are stray. The information that we have on the animals has been gathered since their arrival at the Shelter. and with the help of our volunteers. We do our best to assess the animals and disclose everything we know regarding health and temperament to interested adopters \n\nThe application review process can take between 24-48 hours. The Shelter does NOT do same day adoptions. We do not ship animals or adopt outside of BC.",

I\u2019m ready for a new beginning but before let me tell you my beginning, I had a rough start when I was first brought in with fly bitten ear wounds and drastically underweight.  I definitely am a ladies man and feel more comfortable with women than men at first, I will warm up to men after a little bit though.  I would do well in a ages 13+ home, no little ones!  I would be best suited where I am the only dog in the home but don\u2019t worry, I got tons of love to give!   I am strong at first on a leash but after a couple minutes, I calm down and very easy to walk.  I love to play fetch but still working on bringing it back every time!  I love going to parks and going on runs!  I am a beach bum and love playing in the rolling waves, I am a snuggle addict and I love to give kisses!  I literally love to snuggle with you and I give kisses when you ask!  I may be a bigger boy but let\u2019s face it, I just want to be your big baby!  With all this handsomeness, I have to add that I am quite smart too, I know quite a few commands and I catch on quickly!  Needless to say, I am all that and a furry tail that wags like crazy when I get a peanut butter treat!  I love hard and I\u2019m ready to find my last furever home!  Inquire to meet me and I\u2019ll mesmerize you with my dapper personality!  \n\n\n\nYou can visit Omar  at the Euclid Animal Shelter, 25100 Lakeland Blvd., Euclid, OH.  He has received his initial set of vaccinations except rabies and will be neutered before leaving the shelter. His adoption fee is $80. All of our dog kennels have indoor/outdoor runs so we cannot say with certainty if any of our dogs are housetrained.\n\n*** IMPORTANT UPDATE PER OUR ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICER ***\n\n\u201cThe Shelter will be changing some policies regarding adoptions and reclaims. Your Health as well as ours here at the Shelter is very important. We will be implementing all of the Health Department\u2019s recommendations.\nReclaims and adoptions will be by appointment only. Please inquire via email or if you have any other questions call us at \n216-289-2057\nThank You\nAnn Mills\nAnimal Control\u201d",

He loves walks/hikes, car rides and fellow canines. His happy place is with his canine buddies! Draven had a rough start. He can be unsure of humans. He uses his canine friends to show him which humans are worthy of his love and loyalty. For this reason, we will require Draven goes to a home with other dogs. Preferably dogs around his age, that want to play! Draven's ideal forever family will be patient with him and help him grow to be a confident and secure dog despite his early life. His foster mom says he's a goofy boy who will get mischievous with blankets and socks if left unattended with nothing to play with. He loves toys and chews! Draven is fully potty trained, and crate trained. Draven's forever home will require a secure 6 foot fence with adults or adults and children over 13, and no cats or small animals. Applications can be accessed at www.mikeyschance.com\n\nAll large and/or active dogs will require a full fenced (6ft) secure yard. \nNo children under 5. \n\nLike all Mikey's Chance dogs, this dog will come to you from a foster home that has provided loving one-on-one attention, socialization and some basic training, as well as quality food and exercise. \n\nApplications can be found at www.mikeyschance.com and completed on a computer, tablet, and/or phone. Please note that adopters are not chosen on a first come, first served basis, but full consideration is given to the best fit for the dog AND the adopter. Applications can take up to 3 weeks to process. Application submission DOES NOT guarantee approval for adoption.",

She is adventurous, athletic, and a top notch mouse catcher! So no need for a cat in her forever home, especially since she is not fond of them. Kira is great with kids and loves every person she meets. She recently took her very first trip to a pet store and was VERY impressed. She rides great in a car and is well behaved in public. Kira\u2019s ideal forever home would have a large fenced yard where she could explore when the weather is nice. She loves running through the yard chasing mice, bugs, and anything else that will run from her. She is especially skilled at catching treats mid-air. As far as dog friends, she could take them or leave them but does require proper introductions. If you think Kira could be the girl for you, fill out an application at www.mikeyschance.com. \n\nAll large and/or active dogs will require a full fenced (6ft) secure yard. \nNo children under 5. \n\nLike all Mikey's Chance dogs, this dog will come to you from a foster home that has provided loving one-on-one attention, socialization and some basic training, as well as quality food and exercise. \n\nApplications can be found at www.mikeyschance.com and completed on a computer, tablet, and/or phone.

            "description": "Hewo der! My name is Speedy. I am a 5-year-old, male, Shephard mix weighing around 48 lbs. I am here because The\nCantu Foundation rescued me from a shelter in Tijuana. I wear diapers and I\u2019m good with a leash on my wheels not on my collar. My background is a ruff one. I was found on the side of the road\nafter getting hit by a car! I was rescued by a shelter that lacked the resources to give me the medical attention I so desperately\nneeded. Instead, I was kept in a cage for more than 4 MONTHS! Thankfully The Cantu Foundation found me, stepped up, and took me in. I have the fight in me to walk again...I am currently getting\nphysical therapy and slowly getting better. Despite all of this, I am very chill. I love to be around my pack and go on walkies with my\npack. I am very affectionate, submissive, and I have a zest for life. There is so much more life has to offer, and I don\u2019t want my set-back to get in the way of having the best life! I get all the compliments for being such a good boy (I try my best!). I get\nalong with other doggos and little hoomans. I love walkies and relaxing with my family. I pawmise I am the sweetest most loving\ngrateful doggo you will meet. I hope my journey starts with you! My perfect furever home would be one where I can hang out with my furever family/hooman. I can be left alone but I prefer to be with my hoomans. Little hoomans and other doggos would be just fine. Take me on walkies and car rides, I\u2019ll be so happy! My\nadoption fee is $200 and that includes spaying/neutering and vetting care. If you want to take me home, please fill out the form on the website here thecantufoundation.org/adopt",

Emma will take a while to warm up to her new family, especially the men. She is a very sweet girl and does great with other dogs. We do require Emma goes to a home with another canine companion to help boost her self confidence. Emma is good with children over age 5, she is also crate and potty trained (though may submissive pee when afraid). She loves her crate for a safe space when she feels overwhelmed.\nEmma is still working on walking on a leash-that will need to be an area of continued focus.\nWe do require Emma goes to a home with a fully fenced yard-she is not a good candidate for apartment life.\nApplications can be accessed at www.mikeyschance.com \n\nAll large and/or active dogs will require a full fenced (6ft) secure yard. \nNo children under 5. \n\nLike all Mikey's Chance dogs, this dog will come to you from a foster home that has provided loving one-on-one attention, socialization and some basic training, as well as quality food and exercise. \n\nApplications can be found at www.mikeyschance.com and completed on a computer, tablet, and/or phone. Please note that adopters are not chosen on a first come, first served basis, but full consideration is given to the best fit for the dog AND the adopter. Applications can take up to 3 weeks to process. Application submission DOES NOT guarantee approval for adoption.",

She is a very tall girl and will require a 6 ft fence to keep her safe. Mrytle is good with the other dogs in her foster home except tall dogs and she can be picky with them. She is probably in the 3 - 5 year range and is very active. She would do best in a situation where there is plenty of opportunity for exercise and play. As noted a secure tall fence is required. She is tall, has long runway legs, and she is quite aware of the height advantage of standing on her hind legs to see over things. She has been a very good girl in her foster home and is housetrained. \n\nMyrtle is currently fostered near Pittsburg Pennsylvania. With the help of volunteers, transportation to her forever home can possibly be arranged. Please enquire\n",

            "description": "Meet Big Beautiful Billy\n\nBillys DNA test says he is 75% American Staffordshire Terrier, 12.5% Boxer and 12.5% Hound. He is about 3 years old. Billy did not have a great start to his life, but then he came to AHS for his second chance at a wonderful loving life, the kind he deserves with the right family.\n\nHe is a very beautiful brindle color that people stop and notice. When people meet Billy they are amazed at just how sweet this big 85 pound boy is. Billy is microchipped and neutered, he gets along good with other dogs but we are not sure about cats.\n\nHe is good in the house and he is housebroken but please remember like with any new fur member of the family you must show him the ropes, let him know where the door is and let him get acquainted with his new surroundings. You will need to learn HIS signs of letting you know when he has to go out and that, like most things will take patients, commitment and time.\n\nBilly is a big boy and he loves to play fetch and will bring it back to you and drop it at your feet but if you wait too long to throw that toy he will jump up and try to get it. That being said I would not recommend that he play fetch with very small children as he is very big and powerful and could possibly knock them over with his excitement.\n\nHe does sit, lay down and offer either paw on command when he is at home and in a calm environment. He needs some work on that when he is out though as he gets very excited to be out playing. He is a bit nervous about cars that drive by when walking and that may have something to do with his past, he will just need love and trust and work with that so that he knows his new home and family will always keep him safe.\n\nHe needs some work with his car rides, he does get a bit anxious when he is in the car and will bark. A kennel is recommended for car rides and some work on that. He also needs leash training, he is a big powerful boy and tends to pull on his leash as he does not know any better. He needs someone to teach him the proper way to walk on one. He likes the Costco Signature lamb rice and Veggie food and it seems to do well with him.\n\nOnce he gets settled in and is comfortable with you if you put his dog bed by your bed he will sleep there and in the morning he may ask to join you for a little morning hug.\n\nBecause Billy is a HIGHLY ACTIVE boy the best person/couple/family suited for him must also be very active. Long walks, runs, hiking will be very beneficial for him. A fenced yard is required for this boy so he has a place to run when hes home.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this big beautiful boy please fill out a statement of interest at http://alternative-humane-society.com\n\nLETS GET BILLY-HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS",

He is neutered, heartworm negative and up to date on shots.  He is potty trained, dog friendly and very loving.  He wants to be right by his person's side.  Nicky needs to be with someone who is retired or home most of the time to continue with helping him feel more secure.  He MUST  have another dog as this gives him comfort and confidence and he MUST have a fenced yard.

If you are a confident dog owner, that has lots of  experience with dog training, then I may be your man!  My name is King and I want to be the King of your heart! \n\nMy story is a bit of a mystery, but I am a Husky mix and my new friends at HRAAD believe I am around 1 year old at about 85 pounds right now. \n\nThe previous humans in my life didn't expose me to a-lot of training, so I would do best in a home with no other dogs or children. I really need someone that has experience in large breeds specifically Husky/Malamutes and strong skills in socialization/training. Beautiful relationships sometimes take time. I need someone who will invest the time to come to the shelter and get to know me and build my trust, which means there will need to be multiple supervised meet and greets after an application is approved.\n\nWhat are some of my favorite things? I thought you would never ask! While some might say, \"raindrops on roses, and whiskers of kittens\" my love cup is filled with toys, and going on walks! If you are looking for some entertainment, I promise to give you a daily show with a front row seat to my 85lb puppyish antics playing with my toys, (I just might not want to share them sometimes.\n\nKing has grown so much during his time at here at HRAAD, and is one of our staff's favorites. He has learned leash manners and continues to bring us joy with his playfulness and goofy demeanor. With that being said, King has shown reactive behaviors when going to the vet as well as guarding his toys and food. King is also very excitable, and needs more work on his jumping, and has nipped someone when he was overly excited. For these reasons, King needs to go to a highly experienced dog owner that is willing to continue training.\n\nWill you take me home and give the attention and training I need to become a very good BIG boy? \n\nIf you are interested in adopting me, all you have to do is submit an adoption application, which can be found on our website at www.hoodriveradoptadog.org\n\nOnce your submitted application has been approved,  my adoption counselor will be in contact to discuss the next steps, answer any questions and to schedule a meet and greet.\n\nMy adoption fee is $300\n",

            "description": "IN VERMONT / IN NEED OF LOCAL FOSTER OR ADOPTER/ AVAILABLE FOR FOSTER TO ADOPT FOR LOCAL ADOPTERS\n\nMeet Ryder! Here is his video from being rescued to playing in the grass!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Y9KW4Yu3kqM\n\nRyder is 15 months-old (DOB 7-21-19), male, 55 lbs., vetted, is or will be neutered, and micro-chipped. Ryder fka Bubba was an Owner Surrender in NC who was very selfless in giving him up to a rescue where he could have a happier life. He is a good boy who is learning about the world. Ryder is potty trained, crate trained, has meduim+ energy, walks well on a leash, and know Sit, Stay, Wait, and Leave it. He loves his toys and blankets! Ryder's ideal home would be active, have Intermediate experience and a be strong and confident leader to provide him structure and experienced input, with or without another dog, no cats (seems to have a prey drive toward yard animals), be more rural and outside of an overstimulating city life! Since Ryder is still a toddler that has a short attention span and uses his mouth to express himself we would not recommend small children. Stay tuned as Ryder is a new rescue!\n\nIf you are interested in fostering or adopting Ryder please fill out an Application at\n\nwww.Passion-4-Paws.org\n\n(please make sure you have the Vermont site not CT) - thanks!\n\nPlease note Fosters have 1st option of Adoption.\n\nCheck out his Facebook page (please \"Like\" us while you are there)!\n\nDisclosure:\n\nBreed labels are often incorrect: we rarely know the genetic lineage of the dogs we rescue. Many shelters and rescues specify breeds based on appearance; however, research has shown that less than 2% of a dog's DNA determines appearance!\n\nPassion 4 Paws does not practice the use of labels pertaining to compatibility with others or dog breed. Labels such as \"dog friendly\" and \"child friendly\" should be used with caution as they often over-simplify the personalities and behavior of dogs.",

He has been working on some puppy behaviors and is now ready to find a home to continue his training!  Joker is approximately 70-75 pounds and is considered full grown.\n\nJoker is a bit exuberant when meeting pups, but given proper introductions, he does well with all those he has met!  Joker does best with medium/large pups as he loves to wrestle and roughhouse and can be too much for smaller pups.  Joker is far too interested in cats and should have a home without.\n\nJoker is excited to meet new people and has been working hard on improving his manners.  Occasionally he will still jump up.  He still needs practice on his leash walking skills, but his foster has been working with him and he\u2019s improving.\n\nJoker is kennel trained and believed to be house trained as he hasn\u2019t had any accidents in his foster home.  Joker loves to have his stuffed kong or bone in his kennel to help him pass the time when his foster is at work. Joker loves to play with toys, although he can make short work out of the stuffed ones!  Joker has been working hard on his basic obedience and is treat motivated \u2013 his new family should expect to continue working on his commands to help him continue to learn to be a well-mannered boy!\n\nJoker is vet checked, started on vaccinations, heartworm tested negative, microchipped and neutered.  He is current on his flea/tick/heartworm/deworming preventatives.  Joker\u2019s adoption donation fee is $300.00\n\nWe realize that people are looking for a predominant breed or breed mixture, but visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of our dogs we are only guessing at the predominant breed or breed mix.  We encourage you to select your new companion by considering each dog's individual personality and pet qualities instead of relying on a breed label that is only a guess.\n\nIf you're interested in adopting, please visit our main website at www.sarahstreasuresrescue.net for adoption information and our application!",

            "description": "Brady is 1 yr, 5 mos old, male, hound mix, about 65 lbs. Brady was a MUCH loved dog by his previous owner and it broke their heart to have to bring him back to us but they are unexpectedly returning to their home overseas and are unable to take Brady with them. Brady was obviously treasured by his previous owner as evidenced by the huge trove of items that he also came to us with and that will go out with him to his approved adopter. You can tell Brady was very loved indeed. Now he is a high energy hound boy, so don't think you can just park him in a back yard as we will only adopt him to a home where he will be a member of the family, inside, like he was with his previous owner. He is housetrained and we don't often get to write that about our big hounds. He is great with other dogs, would be a superb running partner for someone as well. And just so you know Brady has been used to eating high quality food, so no junky cheapo food for him - his owner even dehydrated meat and the like for him for natural snacks. Only restriction is he does not seem to be about children so no children please.\nADOPTION FEES Dogs & Puppies.....$100.00. This Adoption fee includes: mandatory spay/neuter which will be done before you can take your dog or puppy home with you; basic canine immunizations (DHPP-CPV & Bordatella Intranasal); de-wormings; one-year rabies vaccination if old enough; heartworm test if over five months old; microchip from 24-Pet Watch; certificate for free health examination at your participating veterinarian; and a goodie bag chocked full of information, toys, and more.\nThe first step to do an adoption is to do our Adoption Application here: https://www.elmorehumane.org/adoption-application-online-form2.html\nIMPORTANT - we respond to your emailed applications and queries via email back to you. Please make sure you have either added our email (hselco@bellsouth.net) to your contact list or that you routinely check your SPAM folder for our response just to be safe. If we do not receive a timely response we simply move on to another applicant.\nYes, there are sometimes exceptions to our normal fee for older dogs or special cases. Some of our pets have also been lovingly sponsored by caring people and we will let the approved adopter know about that at the point of adoption. Visit our Website at: http://www.elmorehumane.org The staff would also like to remind you that for faster response to inquiries about adoptable animals to have the animals ID#, name & description. This way your questions will be answered in a timely manner.\nAll pet adoption websites & our shelter management software require that we choose a primary and/or secondary breed for our dogs. While our staff is quite breed knowledgeable, in many cases we are truly making our best guesses as to their breed(s) based on many factors but cannot promise that what we have said is accurate. So taking into account your own parameters for things such as size, coat care, activity level, etc please come and get to know our dog(s) as individuals to see if their personalities and yours are a forever match.\nPhone: (334) 567-3377 Fax: (334) 567-8774 E-mail: hselco@bellsouth.net",

He was brought to us because he had bitten a cow.\n\nAdoption fee for Dogs is $100, which includes microchip. All of our dogs and puppies have been examined by a veterinarian, de-wormed,  vaccinated, treated for fleas and ticks, spayed or neutered and  tested for heartworms (If 6 months of age and over) and are on monthly heartworm preventative.  Puppies too young to be spayed/neutered require a refundable $50 deposit which will be returned upon proof of spay/neuter. If this is done at our vet (Allen's in Parsons), there is no charge for the spay/neuter. Give us a call at 620-421-0445 or e-mail us at pals@wavewls.com today to find out more about this pet.",

He spent some time in a foster home to get a break from the shelter and his foster mom said it took him a couple of days to warm up, but after that he was definitely a cuddle bug! Kai gets uncomfortable if he is nervous or overwhelmed, so we are asking that he goes to an adult only home and one without other dogs where he can shine as the only pet. His foster also reported that he did really great with his house-training when he was kept on a regular schedule and that he was a big fan of Pup-Peroni treats! You're sure to fall head over heels for this sweet boy. \n\nKai has been neutered, is up-to-date on vaccines, and is microchipped. If you think that you will be Kai's perfect fit, stop by the shelter and visit with him today!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: While visiting the shelter, you MUST wear a face mask and social distance.",

Peaches is great to share a home with cats and school age children (toddlers scare this big chicken). She is even safe to be around chickens! Peaches would prefer to be the only dog companion as cats, children, chickens are quite enough! She is leash, crate, and house trained and she absolutely loves to ride in the car! Peaches will slather you with kisses and snuggles to show you how happy she is to be with you. A fenced yard to run around in would be a huge bonus, but as long as she has some way to get those zoomies out she is pretty adaptable. Peaches is medium sized and approximately 35-40lbs.

With a name like Noodle, you might assume that life has been easy for this little fella, but when he came to Paws in the City, he was in bad shape. With heartworms, a hernia and bad teeth he was feeling pretty lousy. Noodle was also starving, and he still needs to gain some weight! Now that all of his medical needs have been met, and he's got a steady source of food, Noodle needs LOVE!\n\nNoodle is a 10-year-old, 13 lb. Chihuahua mix. He's shy at first, but once he gets to know you, he's very affectionate! Noodle would be a great BFF. He likes other dogs and has been enjoying the company of his foster brothers. Noodle is also very eager to please, and he learns quickly. He would love someone to teach him some new commands. When Noodle naps, he loves to snuggle up with his stuffed toy Valentine's heart.\n\nNoodle is working on his leash skills and crate training. We suspect he had never walked on a leash before coming to PITC. Noodle is also learning that he no longer has to scrounge for food and will now receive a daily supply. He's also discovered a new favorite food, cottage cheese!! Noodle would do best in a home without children.\n\nFor adoption information or to complete an application, please go to: http://www.pawsinthecity.org/adopt.htm\n\nReferences and a home visit are required for all adoptions.",

He has a gentle, goofy personality and loves having his big head rubbed. Cowboy is looking for his rodeo partner/forever home! Check out Cowboy's day out with his favorite people! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnblAbb_t6Y\n\n*Cowboy is on a training plan and requires more than one visit with our Behavior team. If you are interested in meeting Cowboy, please contact us at adoptions@pawscrossedny.org for more information!*\n\nBefore you can adopt sweet Cowboy, please complete an adoption application on our website at pawscrossedny.org! Once your application is approved, you will receive a link to schedule an appointment online. If you have any questions about Cowboy, please email us at adoptions@pawscrossedny.org for more information. Please understand we cannot hold any pet. All adoptions are done on a first come, first adopt basis for approved applicants.\n\nThe Shelter software system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of our dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We encourage you to select your new companion by considering each dog's individual personality and pet qualities instead of relying on a breed label that is only a guess.",

He needs training to build manners but training shouldn't be difficult since he is very smart. He knows sit, down and wait and is toy motivated. He might be good at Frisbee catching. He would make a great hiking or running buddy.\n\nChance should be in a home with no other dogs or cats, at least to start.  Because of his exuberance, no children under 10.  And, he will need a home with a securely fenced yard.\n\nLink to our online adoption application:\nhttp://beachpets.com/long-beach-wa-shelter/dog-adoption-application/\n\nFor information on our adoption process, go to:\nhttp://beachpets.com/adopt/",

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: 8/31/2020\nReason for being in rescue: Gypsy was surrendered by her owners directly to rescue\nFoster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SC\nSpecial Needs? Gypsy was spayed on 9/22/20 and is now ready for her forever home. GYPSY WILL NOT BE ADOPTED TO A FIRST TIME DOG OWNER.\nWeight: 37 lbs\nHeight: 18 in\nSpayed/Neutered: No\n\nAdoption Fee: $200\n\nFence needed? Yes\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Gypsy needs an owner experienced with rescue dogs. She has never lived in a home and is just beginning to learn what human kindness means. Gypsy's entire life has been lived in a feral, outdoor colony. She has come a long way in a short time in rescue, but is very much a work in progress. She would be okay with other dogs in the home, but does not require them. Gypsy is not well suited to a home with younger children.\n\nGypsy's ideal owner has rescued dogs and has experience with dogs that are undersocialized and/or haven't had a lot of life experiences. They are committed to slowly and patiently teaching her how to be a dog.\n\nWhat is my personality like? Gypsy has lived her entire life as part of a feral dog colony. She was loved and fed by her owners, but human interaction was not part of life. Gypsy was much loved as a young dog, perhaps even living inside the house; but then as more and more dogs came (some even her puppies), she and her fellow canines were thrown outside. Gypsy became the leader, not a role she wanted, but a role she was put into and needed to fill. It was up to her to keep the pack safe and it was a lot of pressure on her. There was never enough resources, never enough food, never enough water, never enough shelter. Gypsy had to make had choices and she had to keep 17 dogs from fighting. She had to grow up faster than any pup should have to.\n\nNot that the pressure if off, Gypsy simply wants to be the best companion dog she can be. She shows you this by wanting to be with you. That life was had. Now that she no longer has to worry Gypsy can just relax. But she wants to follow. Gypsy knows and is comfortable living with other dogs. Gypsy has slowly begun to learn the routine of crating, feeding, humans, etc. since arriving in rescue on 8/31/20.\n\nGypsy's caregivers describe her as a sweet girl who will sit at your feet and does not want to be ignored. It is important to remember this is the perspective of individuals Gypsy has known and been building trust with for several months. She will do this with her new home - but it will take some time. Gypsy is an alpha dog. She will hump her friends / siblings / family from the feral colony to show her dominance. She does fine with other dogs, but does not need another dog in the home.\n\nLeash walking is a skill that we have been slowly working on with Gypsy. She is timid on a leash, which is not surprising given that she's never been on one before. She has learned the routine of being crated, but does not like when other dogs walk by her crate and will bark and growl at them. In general, Gypsy does best being introduced to dogs in open spaces. If another dog is behind a fence, Gypsy will just bark at them. She didn't have a lot of boundaries in her feral colony days and we suspect that contributes to this behavior.\n\nGypsy is still very much a work in progress, but has come a long way and has a ton of potential.\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people?\n\nOther tips and tidbits: Gypsy's estimated birthday is 9/1/2016\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

This handsome boy has had a very rough start as he came to rescue with a hip injury and heartworm positive but he'll be receiving the best care possible and will be on the road to recovery soon. His owners surrendered him to a shelter as they could no longer care for him. Sage appears to be house trained, and seems good with cats. This fella is dog selective, likely due to his past and typical of his breed, but with slow, proper introductions and non-reactive siblings, he can certainly be part of the right pack. Sage will be decompressing for a bit in his new foster home, and we will share more about him as we learn. Sage will need an experienced home who can show this boy what a truly loving family can be like. Could it be yours?\n\nGiant Breed Experienced Homes Only.\nTo see the most up to date adoption status of this dog, please visit www.bigdogshugepaws.com\nThis is just one of hundreds of gentle giants available for adoption at BDHPI!

He has been roaming and having litters with the other dog for a few years and fed sporadically. Thankfully they had a guardian angel step up to save them so that they could have a chance at a normal life. Banner was caught just time as he had a head wound that had become infected and abscessed; he was treated asap and is well on his way to recovery. Banner while initially shy and skittish has done a complete 180 and is a fun, loving, attention seeking pup who enjoys very much the human company he has been desperately craving. Despite his meager beginnings, he is great on leash, rides well in the car, gets along with all sizes of dogs and has been great with all humans he has met so far. He has been around livestock with no issues and the only thing we don't know about is cats; which we can of course test him with. Banner is so happy be indoors you will often find him snoozing away and in such a deep sleep that he snores. We are very happy to be able to help such a sweet soul and cannot wait to see him off with his forever home.\n\nTo see the most up to date adoption status of this dog, please visit www.bigdogshugepaws.com\nThis is just one of hundreds of gentle giants available for adoption at BDHPI!

            "description": "Marcie. Pit mix. Female. 2 yo. 55lbs. Dogs.\n\nMama Marcie was found running the streets along with her 6 puppies, living in an abandoned and collapsed building that a mouse could barely fit into. 2 years old herself, this young super woman, has been an incredible mother who is ready to take the stage as she deserves. Originally this beauty was fairly scared of human touch and rightfully so as she never knew kindness. We saw the light in her eyes immediately and we knew that she was going to learn to trust humans, let alone become a dog that one would never guess the past of. Marcie is ready for her story to further be created. She is curious. She is smart. She is kind. She is love. She\u2019s looking for a savvy home with a secure yard. Humans looking to earn her trust and in return have the greatest friend of a lifetime. A Well socialized dog would be a huge plus, to continue help this star develop into her full potenial of awesome. She is AWESOME and her limit surpasses the sky.\n\nAnimals can be viewed by appointment only. We ask that you review our adoption information AND fill out an adoption application prior to setting an appointment so we have all your information and you understand our adoption procedures - you can do so online here.     \n\nPlease feel free to email us or call us anytime for additional information on any of our animals - info@mcprescue.org or 312-388-3928. Our typical adoption fee varies based on the age of the dog at the time of rescue: Under the age of 1 years old is $500; 1-5 years old is $400; over the age of 5 is $300. Fees include vaccinations, microchip, deworming and other vetting as needed. Our adoption process includes an application, reference check and home visit.",

To learn about fostering dogs like Mullen, please contact us at http://www.dogsxlrescue.org/volunteer/foster\n\nName: Mullen\n\nBreed: Great Pyrenees mix\n\nApproximate Age: 3-4 years\n\nApproximate Weight: 63 pounds\n\nCurrently Living at: Local Foster Home\n\n*MULLEN'S FUTURE FAMILY MUST HAVE A CONFIDENT RESIDENT DOG*  \n\nMeet Mullen! It's the holiday season and it's cider time - just add apples to these mullen' spices! Okay, not my best pun, but Mullen sure is the best boy! Mullen is a happy, friendly guy looking for a loving forever home who won't subject him to the likes of our bad word play  (just kidding, he only speaks dog and frankly, as a pyr, he's not going to listen to anything you say anyway)! At 63 pounds, he's kind of a \"pocket\" pyr, so if you want all the fluff and tumble of a pyrenees without the massive size, Mullen is your guy! Mullen would love a home with a fenced in yard where he can sing the songs of his people and alternately patrol his territory and take naps in the sun. Mullen is a gentle giant and is looking for a home with another dog to keep him company while his humans are out of the home and ideally a family who is home a good part of the time. Mullen is super affectionate, described by his fosters as a \u201ctotal snuggle bug!\u201d Mullen loves people - from the littlest kiddos (Mullen LOVED the baby he met) to older kids, and adults and is a wonderful companion dog who is sure to make a lucky family very happy! Apply today to meet Mullen!\n \n\nMullen needs a foster or a loving forever home to lavish love and attention on him. Please open your heart and home to Mullen!\n\n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $300, which includes the cost of heartworm treatment and routine vetting, including vaccinations and spay/neuter.\n\n \n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out the application online at http://www.dogsxlrescue.org/adopt/adoption-questionnaire\n\n \n\nThank you for considering adoption and helping to save a life!\n \n\nPlease visit us online at www.DogsXLRescue.org",

            "description": "1-16-2021: Harvey is doing GREAT!!  He's gained 8lbs and just had his surgery and new blood work. He's so much stronger and happier now. He can do 2 flights of stairs and is working hard on his house training. He is one of the sweetest dogs I have ever met. He is great with other dogs and cat safe. I am looking for a Foster to Adopt home that can help continue his heartworm slow kill and spoil him rotten. You must have a safe fenced in yard.<p>\n\n11-3: I was contacted about a Setter in a shelter in Southern Illinois the end of October. Thanks to my old rescue friend Kathy, we got Harvey on a transport to Chicago on 11-5. I thought perhaps he was a senior in the first photos I saw of him and I knew he was thin. Upon arrival hew was weak, emaciated and defeated looking. Thankfully my vet had booked an appointment for us with his arrival and started him on IV fluids right away. They also shaved off most of the terrible matting all over his body. Harvey was also covered in fleas and he had a very low heart beat called Bradycardia. Dr. John and I both agreed we would be shocked if he didn't have heartworms. After his blood was drawn and a B12 injection, Harvey and I headed home for his spa treatment. After the flea shampoo, I got him started on intestinal dewormer and gave him a good meal that also included heartguard and antibiotics. He ate very well thankfully. Blood work the next day showed he was indeed heartworm positive and he also had hookworms and had elevated white blood cells, neutrophils and lymphocytes and he also has a tick borne disease called Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The next morning Harvey was feeling so much better. He was holding his head up and his eyes weren't so sunken in. He continued to eat better and also stated trotting around my yard. Later that morning he moved to foster care and spent the weekend at their lake home with more TLC and lots more food. Harvey is currently being treated with our heartworm slow kill program and we will take our time building him up before he is neutered. He came in weighing 37lbs and needs to gain at least 15-20lbs. We aren't sure of his age- but estimate he could be 9- 12 years old and is partially deaf. \n\n11-16: After a week in care- Harvey is doing tremendously well. He has lots more energy and lots more spunk. We now believe he is at the younger side of his age estimate. We are actively looking for a Foster to Adopt home for him in the Chicago area that can help us continue his treatment. If you would like to help out, please message me here or call Lisa at 630-694-1359.",

She might be deaf and blind but her disabilities don\u2019t stop her from being an amazing gentle giant!! \n\nMarge is a bundle of joy with a big heart and lots of love to give! She is good with medium and large dogs. She doesn't show interest in cats. \nMarge needs another dog in order to thrive. She loves to play with her foster brothers and sister. Marge shows some OCD tendencies when she's overstimulated or in a new place by walking in circles. She is easily redirected and once she has acclimated to her new place the circling stops. \n\nMarge is a very sweet girl that enjoys some nice scratches and a comfy bed for her naps. She is house and crate trained. She walks well on a leash and also knows touch commands for sit and stop. Sweet Marge is fully vetted, microchipped and vaccinated. \n\nWe will require Marge to be in training within 30 days of adoption. Basic obedience training is crucial for Marge to bond with her forever family, learn new commands and reinforce good manners. \n\nAre you ready to open your home and heart to this amazing girl? You can find the adoption process and application here: www.whitekissesgreatdanerescue.com/adopt",

            "description": "Castle was originally transferred to us from Detroit Animal Care and Control, where he was found as a stray. Castle was fearful and shut down when he first arrived at THS. He is currently residing in a foster home where he has made incredible progress! \n\nHis foster reports that he is housebroken, and working on crate training! Castles favorite time of the day, Breakfast and dinner! As soon as he wakes up in the morning, he is dancing around until his breakfast is served. Castle is slowly learning that the world is a not-so-scary place after all. Castle used to walk off the side of the trail to avoid new people walking by. But after just a few short months, Castle is now able to keep calm and walk right next to his foster mom on walks. Although he is still working on his confidence when passing loud noises, Castle receives compliments on his excellent leash walking skills! What's better than a walk through the park? Obviously, the car ride home! Castle makes a wonderful copilot and enjoys watching the world pass by through the window. \n\nDuring the day he prefers to lounge around and will rotate from napping on his dog bed, to the couch, to the bed. When he first arrived to his fosters home, he did not have a clue what toys were, or how to play with them. Although he still has yet to play with toys, he has begun to chew on bones! With a calm household and a patient family, Castle should be able to continue to make great progress and learn how to become a happy and confident dog. Adopters should consult with a trainer to continue to help Castle make progress after adoption as well. \n\nCastle is currently residing in a foster home with another dog, and seems to enjoy the company! He takes time to warm up to people, and will initially go to his \"safe place\" (foster moms room) when guests first arrive. After the activity settles down, he will come back out and join everyone. Although he enjoys watching from afar, this is great progress for Castle as he used to avoid strangers altogether. \n\nCastle was recently treated for heartworm disease and will need to go home with a year of heartworm prevention medication. THS requires all adopters of heartworm positive dogs to purchase a 1 year supply of heartworm preventative at the time of adoption.\n\nEmail foster@toledohumane.org if you are interested in adopting!",

Meet Dip!!!\n\nDip came to us last year when she was spotted at a photo shoot and a foster stepped up to help save her. Dip was quickly adopted and very much loved. Sadly Dip's mom needs to leave the state to take care of an ill family member and Dip can't go with her. So Dip is back with us looking for another forever home. Dip is 14 years old but happy and healthy. She gets along fine with people and dogs. She can't do stairs and would prefer not to be carried so a single story home or apartment is best for her. Let's find Dip a loving home! Email dogs@labradorsandfriends.org or fill out our online application at www.labradorsandfriends.org Dip is located in Southern California.",

Well, no longer as this boy quickly embraced the creature comforts of couches and beds. He is an estimated 12 years old and 48 pounds. This older guy loves people and his favorite place is to be laying next to his family with their hands touching him. He is a lower energy dog, content to nap most of the day away. Rosco is fostered with other dogs, but has a very long adjustment period to new dogs, so would do best as the only dog in the home. He can be reactive on leash towards other dogs so will need a handler strong enough to handle him and willing to walk him in lower traffic areas. Rosco was diagnosed with Cushing's, which is managed with medication and periodic testing to make sure he is on the correct dosage. He is housebroken, but wears belly bands in case he has an accident. Rosco is also crate trained, though he is fine left loose in a bedroom. This sweet guy is looking for a forever family to spoil him for the rest of his life. Apply for Rosco today!",

Paid for by the rescue upon approval of trainer by rescue.  \n\nHistory: Frito McNabb was abandoned at a park and ride in Washington State, with some coaxing and care he was \"nabbed' and brought to Valhalla to find his forever home. He's now fully vetted and we're learning more about him everyday. He's a happy guy, walks well on a leash, and overall good dog. Needs a home that is patient and understanding of the fact that we may never know his history. He seems to be looking for his person. He doesn't want to be alone outside for long periods of time, but does great inside. Loves car rides. Will definitely need a fenced yard as he tends to follow his nose. \n\n",

Chico is a solid and powerful dog who would benefit from basic training classes. He needs a family who will be able to set boundaries and be stern with him, otherwise he will take advantage and be a wild child (including some mouthiness). Chico does well with other dogs although he isn\u2019t aware of his size or strength, because of this a home with larger dogs and/or older children is best. He is crate trained, potty trained, and very food motivated! Chico would LOVE to have a home for the holidays, apply to adopt or foster this handsome boy!\n\n\nApply at  http://caninehumane.org/adoption-application/\n\n\nAdoption Fee is $350\nHe is up to date on vaccines and has had a wellness exam, heartworm tested and micro-chipped.\n\n In order to meet any of our dogs, please fill out an application.

The male in his life was abusive. Fetch was forced to live outdoors for at least 11 months of the year for his entire 5 years. He is so happy to be indoors and warm has a cozy bed and real food.\n\nFetch needs a VERY dog, savvy WOMAN. perhaps someone who has adopted rescued dogs or understands the abused dog. Though his life was miserable, and he was so scared when he arrived, it took just a week to gain his trust. Fetch needs someone who will spend a lot of time just talking to him, coaxing him with healthy treats, and being patient. Once he decides he trusts you, he becomes your best friend HEART and SOUL. Fetch is a very special boy. He loves to be held, sleep close, and go everywhere you go. When properly introduced to a new woman, and having that individual give him a treat he will do well with them. He can pick out an untrustworthy person from 100 yards and warn you they need to keep their distance, heed that warning. He is spot on. Fetch really frieks out with men so we have learned, NO males. Period. He fears men's feet, so we assume he was kicked.\n\nFetch loves to go for walks, but the city life overwhelms him. Mostly due to having been locked in a yard. He has leash aggression so it's best to walk him on trials and when there is a dog on a lead in the distance, take him away from the oncoming dog. Fetch is leash trained and he does love his walks, so it would be nice if you are also a long-distance walker and will give this boy the physical and mental stimulation he needs. Fetch would do best in a more rural area for walking, or smaller town.\n\nFetch was so named because he loves to run the length of a yard to fetch a ball and return it. We have a massive yard here, the likes of which he has never seen and he loves to run it. He is getting into great physical shape.\n\nFetch is being fed a raw diet and Human Grade dog food. We will educate his adopters on Canine Nutrition and species-specific foods.\n\nTo fill out an application to adopt Please use this link, You will need a computer to complete as cell phones will drop the application. Fetch has a $650.00 adoption fee. All fees are recycled to save more dogs\n\nhttp://rompinpawsrescue.rescuegroups.org/forms/\n\nThe site will ask you to create a password and will send you an email. For ease of use, just use the password they create for you and save that password. This will ensure you have access and can fill out the application.",

Estimated DOB April 2020.\nChanel weighs 61 lbs but will continue to grow as she matures.  She will be a large dog when she is full grown, weighing possibly 90 lbs or more.\n\nChanel is good with male dogs of medium to large size who have a laid back personality.  It would be best for her to be matched with a younger dog who is playful as she can be too rowdy for an older dog.  \nChanel would also do well as an only dog.\nShe is good with cats.\nChanel has not been raised with small children.\n\nHer owner tells us that she is housebroken, leash trained and knows basic commands.\nAlthough she is usually good with the male dog she has been raised with, she doesn't like to share her food or high value treats/toys/belongings and does best when she is fed in her own private space.\n\nPlease email for more info schwartza@icloud.com\n\n",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.If you are viewing this dog on a website other than BFPA.org, please go directly to\nour website for more information on adoption requirements and specifics for this dog.\nWebsites such as Petfinder and Adopt-A-Pet may not show all the information that we\nhave listed.\nFOSTER PARENT COMMENTS: Captain is very friendly toward other people and loves everyone he meets. He has a full body wag when he meets people and dances around for the first ten minutes before calming down for cuddles and kisses!\nHe gets along with dogs and has done well in doggy day care. He likes to play and\nis always ready to play with a flirt pole! With other dogs, he uses his whole body to\nplay and this means he needs playmates that can keep up with his energy.\nIf he lives with another dog, they will need to have the same style of play. He could\nbe a perfect only or first dog too!\nHe is not aggressive with toys or bones but he definitely likes to make them all his. We\ndo not know how he would do with cats.\nHe does really well with older children...11 and over. Due to his size and energy\nlevel, he would probably be a bit much for younger children.\nCaptain is probably too large and vocal for apartment living. He is very alert to noises\nand will bark if he sees someone through the window. At that point, if he is sent to\nanother room (yes, he listens to commands to exit the room/enter the crate etc) he will\ncalm down.\nHe is fully house and crate trained. He sleeps on his bed at night next to the foster's\nbed. He is crated only when the foster is away for work. He is comfortable and\nfamiliar with the crate and is smart enough to know that his dad will come back. He\ndoes not whine when the foster parent is away and passes time on his own like a\nchamp. He is a high energy, big puppy.\nCaptain gets two 30 minute walks per day as the foster is working on the leash walking.\nIn addition to this, the foster uses a flirt pole and tug toys to play and further provide\nexercise as Captain is getting shredded preparing for adoption day! When he has been\nexercised by playing, walking or jogging, he turns into a snuggler. But when he lacks\nexercise, his behavior will reflect that he needs exercise. A fenced yard for playing\nand running is great, but he does very well with two walks a day or one walk and\nplaytime with other dogs/toys outdoors.\n\nCaptain's foster has worked with him on basic training and he has learned several\ncommands. He is very, VERY smart and is food motivated which helps with\ntraining. The foster was able to teach him two tricks in one day! He is young and so\nfull of life. His happiness is contagious especially when he is carrying around his bone\nwith his behind wiggling from his tail wagging so hard! Captain is the sweetest dog\nwho has never met a stranger and who will be a loyal family member. He will be\nready and by your side for any adventure you have planned! He loves humans\nand absolutely loves to give kisses. Could he give one to you??\nEVERY DOG HAS A STORY: Captain was originally found as a stray and taken to\nWake County Animal Shelter. He was adopted very quickly into a home with\nanother dog. The older dog in the home had issues with him as he got to be a bigger\ndog and needed to be rehomed.\nSome of the information contained in this biography includes approximations based\non our expertise and is not guaranteed.\nINTERESTED IN ADOPTING CAPTAIN?

I found myself in lockup in W.Tn after my human passed away and nobody else wanted me, which is not fair because with the right person I am a very sweet girl. I wish to be loved again, and to be an only doggie. I do not like the kitties in my foster home, and my foster Mom is always telling me to leave it or no Penny leave the kitties alone. So a home with no kitties and no other doggies would be so awesome, but maybe some little humans age 10 and up. I am scared of loud noises and do not like thunder or fireworks. My foster Mom is trying so hard to understand me and I trust her to do right by me. So if you have patience and understanding, I could be a very good girl. I do like to go for walks, but not around other dogs.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\n\nIf you are viewing this dog on a website other than BFPA.org, please go directly to our website for more information on adoption requirements and specifics for this dog. PLEASE COMPLETE AN APPLICATION AT BFPA.ORG IF INTERESTED!\n\nMelanie is a Chihuahua mix about 10 years old. She is currently 9 pounds but will not weigh more then 10-11 pounds. She will make a wonderful companion for an older person or a younger couch tater. She is pretty low maintenance, comical , she only wants to be warm and fed. Her true happiness would be on the couch with her person.\n\nMelanie was rescued on the side of the road. She weighed almost 7 lbs and was skin and bones. Her hide was a field of seed tics. Her eyes were so cloudy we doubted her eyesight. This was a sad, neglected, abandoned pup. She had major trust issues, not wanting you to scoop her up. We, frankly, were unsure she'd recover. The first weeks we just bathed and fed her and let her sleep. She surprised us. She looks like a dog now. She gleefully tears out the back door with the other dogs. Her recovery has been remarkable.\n\nShe is timid but is better once she settles in and gets to know you. She still doesn't really like being picked up but will follow you around the house. She gets along with my 2 dogs, but I think she'd be happier as an only dog. Melanie does OK with cats. She has been around a 4 and 6 year old child alot, she is aware they are there but has no interest in them. She's not a dog to be adopted as a child's pet.\n\nShe's quiet unless there is a visitor. Then, she lets you know you have company. She is housebroken but as an older dog, the owner must be diligent in taking her out. She has been left for 6 hours before without a potty break. She sleeps through the night easily in her crate in the den. She is crate trained with no complaint. She must be placed in the crate. She may have spent too much time crated in her past, so is not eager to walk into the crate.\n\nMelanie has a low level of energy. She is amazingly quick when she wants to be. A fenced yard is nice, but not a necessity. We have not been leash walking Melanie but her new family would have to work with her on this. She will come when you call her and follow you. Picking her up is not her favorite thing, but if you do, she is calm and quiet in your arms.\n\nMelanie is currently diabetic and requires insulin shots twice daily. We're not sure if this is a lifelong condition, but it may be. This is not a cuddly wet kisses kind of small dog. This is an observant older companion that stays by your side, wants to be in the room you are in. Her favorite pastime is waiting on her next meal and napping on the couch with me. Melanie is looking for her forever home that will give her all the love and security she deserves after a rough start to her life.\n\nSome of the information contained in this biography includes approximations based on our expertise and is not guaranteed.\n\nApplicants must live a reasonable distance from Cary NC as our dogs must be seen by a BFPA veterinarian for all medical care prior to adoptions being finalized. Our foster guardians deliver dogs to their new homes for adoption trials and we do home visits to finalize all adoptions. We therefore require applicants to live within a reasonable drive of Cary NC.\n\nINTERESTED IN ADOPTING MELANIE ? If so, please fill out our dog adoption application by copying and pasting this link in a new browser window:\n\nhttps://toolkit.rescuegroups.org/of/f?c=WHMSYCNC",

Elsa had a rough start to her short life, she and her sister came into the shelter as strays as young pups and they stayed in the shelter for quite a few months until a caring foster stepped up to take them out of the shelter and show them what life with a loving family is all about.\n\nShe is shy with humans and has been working really hard to learn to trust people. She has been with her current foster for a few months now and is learning that humans can be pretty cool.\n\nElsa is looking for a family that is willing to be patient with her and show her that she is loved and worth the wait. We promise you that if you give her a chance, she will be the perfect companion. She enjoys long walks, peanut butter pretzels and playing with her canine foster sister. Naps and snuggles on the sofa next to her trusted human is her most favorite activity of all.\n\nElsa is crate trained and house trained. We think a household with a canine sister or brother or two would be amazing-in fact, only homes with a canine sibling will be considered for Elsa. Kids are ok but we feel not younger then 10 would be best.  We are not sure about cats but think a fenced in yard would be perfect.\n\nElsa is UTD on everything, microchipped and spayed and would love an opportunity to find her forever family. If you think your home would be a good fit for our sweet Elsa, please consider applying @ https://www.emailmeform.com/builder/form/ICY0zLb5eMAfRd8dptd7",

He is in a foster home with smaller dogs right now and loves all the small dogs he meets and has been good with bigger dogs but can be slightly dominant. He doesn't have an aggressive bone in his body, he loves all people. He loves to sleep at night in the bed with his people or sleeping in a dog bed in the room with you. He is the sweetest dog you will ever meet, he loves to cuddle on the couch and is very chill. He is heart worm positive but has received treatment and the rescue will pay for treatment until he is negative. He needs a large fenced in yard as he hates to use the bathroom on a leash and loves to run in a yard! Please consider giving this sweet baby his forever home \n\nIf you are interested in giving Hagrid a forever home, please visit the link below to fill out an application! http://fureverafterrescue.org/adoption-application.html It is best to submit an application through a computer. We have experienced some problems when applications have been submitted using a mobile device. *When you submit the application, you are not obligated to adopt however it does reserve for you the opportunity to adopt that particular animal.

If you choose not to adopt, we will contact the next approved applicant. If you have any questions or difficulties, please contact us and we will be glad to help!",

            "description": "~~~~~\nBuck is a beagle/terrier shep mix.  He weighs about 40 pounds  He is 1-1.5 years old. Good with all and very sweet!\n He is a real sweet pea- loves to cuddle on the sofa   loves. a  nice walk in the yard or neighborhood - sweet on kids. \nHis foster mum says every time that she looks at him , it's like looking at a toddler with a baseball cap toddling around in the kennel yard!   Interested in adopting ?? Fill an application at LittleRhodyRescue.com ! \n\n~~~~~\n\n\nDue to Covid-19 concerns, we are not planning any public adoption events. If you are pre approved , we will call to set up an appointment to come and meet the dog and potentially take them home. It is by appointment only- \nDogs will be brought into the outdoor kennel for you to meet and make your decision. MASKS WILL BE MANDATORY to maintain EVERYONE'S safety  NO EXCEPTIONS PLEASE !! Unless otherwise noted, the puppies and dogs listed will arrive on Saturday, November 7th, 2020 .\nPlease follow this link to fill out an application. It is step one in adopting a pup from our rescue.\nhttp://littlerhodyrescue.com/adoption-application/ \n\n*Filling an application does not guarantee you as the adopter. All applicant's references will be called. PLEASE call your veterinarian and personal references and allow consent to speaking with us ! \nWe cannot process your application otherwise. Failure will put your application in 'Limbo\"  \nWe process applications as they arrive. The first approved applicant will be called and the pup taken off of Petfinder. We do not have the man/ woman power to all all other applicants to advise them. \nIF there s another dog that you are interested in as well, please list at the top of the application and we will enter your application for that pup if the first choice has been adopted. \n\nTHANK YOU !!! You are giving a first rate dog a second chance....By adopting! \n\n***** SADLY , we need to put this in print: THIS IS A RESCUE DOG. We do NOT know their birthday / age.  (unless other wise noted)  \nMore often than not, OUR TEAM  has saved them from euthanasia in Southern shelters. \nWe do not know any more than our Veterinarians offer to us. \n We often have them in kennels, and utilize crate training.  House training status is often NOT KNOWN. \nPrior Health, estimated weight  (as an adult), breed (Including the parents' breed , size or mix)   and some health concerns are  NOT KNOWN unless our veterinarians discover it and offer the information to us.   Again, these are strays and turn ins from all over the country. They do NOT come with labels; nor guarantees. \n\nCharacteristics and disposition can and will evolve with time.\nYOU the adopter are responsible to train and keep up to date on vaccines and preventatives.  \nYOU the adopter are responsible for taking care of this new member of your family. \n *************\n\n****\nOur adoption fees are $ 600. This fee includes the transportation of the pet from one of the organizations that we work with in TX, LA or TN. Before joining us in RI all dogs are: spayed/neutered, microchipped, up to date on age-appropriate vaccines, and on de-wormers, flea/tick and heartworm prevention. In addition, all adults (6 months +) are heartworm tested and MUST be negative for both heartworm and microfilaria before transport. \n\nIn addition to the above, all dogs must have a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection and be deemed healthy per USDA law in order to travel. Once they have been certified they are then transported via USDA transport services only, which is required by law. \n We  sometimes don't understand how bad the situation is for these pups and dogs in southern states.  Many people in the south don't spay or neuter their pets as we do here. Subsequently, there are thousands of beautiful , worthy pups and dogs, kittens and cats  that are dumped, shot, abandoned, brought into shelters, neglected, abused and abandoned.  We step in , tend to their veterinary needs. As you can see above, we never fail to properly spay and neuter. Everything is done with the  caring , capable hands of our veterinarians to get them healthy and ready to place them for adoption. That's when we put the demand for family- friendly pets with the supply ..... \n\nGive a first rate dog a second chance!!!! ADOPT! \n\n\nKeep in mind that we also offer a two week return policy for the return of a healthy dog that includes a full refund. We want to make sure that the adoption is a perfect fit for both you and the dog.\n\nIf you would like more information about adopting please select \"More About Little Rhody Rescue\" where you will also find our online application if you'd like to proceed with the adoption process. Thank you!",

            "description": "Emma Jean is a spunky little lady of approximately 12 years and 22 lb.. She loves everyone she meets. She would do best in a home with small dogs or bigger dogs who are a little older and less playful. She would also be fine with cats as she ignores other pets.Emma has met some kids and seems fine, but we would suggest older kids just because she's a senior girl.\nEmma Jean is very laid back and is just happy to be with her human. She loves to nap but is also always up for a walk and even a hike!\nEmma does have one eye that does not have sight, but it doesn't seem to bother her. She's getting some eye lubricant drops daily. She is also slightly hard of hearing but that just means her naps are interrupted less! She truly is the sweetest little girl.\nEmma Jean needs a family that is home more often because she does have accidents when left for more than 6 hours. However, she is house-trained if taken out more often--understandable! She is not fond of a crate or being locked in one room. She wants to be with her humans.Emma Jean is microchipped, spayed, up-to-date on vaccines and heartworm negative. To find out more about Emma Jean, contact her foster mom, Gloria, at 706-541-2052. Emma's adoption fee is $225.00 & she is in Augusta, GA.\n\nNOTE: Submission of an application and fee does not guarantee adoption of any specific Boston, since that particular dog may have applications pending or may not be the right match for you.\n\nPlease use the foster momma or dad's contact information above for questions.\nThe process always begins with an application which can be found at The Boston Terrier Rescue of East Tennessee website\nNote that in most cases, we do not adopt to families with small children, e.g., 'under 6,' as a precaution to the child's safety and the dog's safety. In some cases with larger Boston mixes or other dogs, we do make exceptions. Please ask the foster momma.\nWe prefer to place dogs within driving distance of where they are being fostered. If someone from outside the local area is approved for adoption, they must be willing to personally drive/fly to get the dog. The East Coast division (NC/SC/VA/MD/DC) does have special transport capabilties for their kids. Ask them.\nAlso, submission of an application and fee does not guarantee adoption of any specific Boston since that particular dog may have applications pending or may not be the right match for you.",

            "description": "Sylvia is a young dog with an unknown past. We rescued her from a rural shelter. Her life before that is a mystery. She came to us anxious and fearful of normal, everyday things like going outside and going for car rides. In the last month that she's been with us, Sylvia has come a long way! Her foster family sees progress with her every week! She is affectionate and loving towards her foster family and enjoys spending time at their sides as they work or do their online schooling. Sylvia is now much more comfortable going outside and even runs around a bit! Her foster family has even seen her natural border collie running/herding moves a couple of times! She's still a bit skittish, but she has definitely become more relaxed in her foster home. Sylvia's anxiety is improving, but she is still a work in progress. Her foster family continues to work with her with the everyday things, and her forever family would need to be prepared to continue to work with her. We are looking for an experienced dog owner without small kids and without other dogs.\n\nWe are currently looking for an experienced dog owner that can continue to work with Sylvia on her issues. She is probably better as an only dog. If you really want to make a difference with a rescue and have the time to work with Sylvia, she is making great strides already, and is a young girl with so much potential!\n_________________________________________________________________________\nAdoption Donation for Sylvia is $ 425.00\n\nWANT TO MEET Sylvia\n\nThe first step would be for you to go to our website at www.aear.org and then to the \"\"Adopting a Pet\"\" page to read about our Adoption Process which will answer many of your questions and then to fill out an Adoption Application.\n\nAlso, please visit our very active Facebook Page for updates on Sylvia and our other adoptable pets with AEAR - www.facebook.com/aear.org",

She's settling in nicely and taking cues of what to do and where to go from her foster brother and Labrador, Jack.\n\nThis lovely girl is heartworm positive, but shows no symptoms of heartworm disease. Due to her age, the regular heartworm treatment is too aggressive. She needs to be very consistently given monthly heartworm prevention to keep her healthy.\n\nMaggie is one of the dogs we took in from another shelter far away. Her past is a complete mystery.

Benson loves nothing more than to feel safe and snuggle on the couch or lounge around with his humans. He is very sweet and gives a lot of love! Benson is great with humans (kids 10+ ok too) and loves to meet new people. He\u2019s very smart and quick to learn new tricks like high five, paw, stay, sit and lay. He\u2019s also crate and potty trained! Benson was not properly trained or introduced to other animals early on in his life, so he has a high prey drive. We are working with a trainer in Eugene, OR who is helping him appropriately react to other animals. However, due to his reactivity, he will need a home where he is the only pet and has a very secure (6ft +) and solid fenced yard (no chain link or other see through fences). Benson has learned a communication system built on rewards and positive verbal markers. This system can be used to continue to develop and nurture his self confidence. Much of his dog reactivity is rooted in a lack of feeling safe. To thrive he will need a strong leader to advocate for him, manage his occasional outbursts of leash reactivity (towards cats/dogs) and to protect him from harm. His ideal match is someone mentally alert enough and physically strong enough to correct and redirect him when he fails to control his impulses. He enjoys affection and praise which can be used as a form of reward. Due to Benson's strength and size, a muzzle should always be worn when out in public. He does have mild separation anxiety and is more comfortable when his human is with him. He is crate trained which can be used at times when he must be left alone. He has shown no signs of human aggression or resource guarding but he seems to have had previous success grabbing the leash away from his handler when overstimulated or frustrated. Another reason a muzzle is ideal for leash walking or being on leash in public. Benson needs a family or best friend who can manage his size and strength, and is ok with him staying at home or playing in the yard (and being managed appropriately). He is not for someone looking for a running or walking partner, or someone that wants to take their dog out to the breweries. He is a sweet human bonded dog that wants to be by your side at home, and will reward you with lots of snuggles and kisses. Benson's trainer has graciously offered to help any potential adopter with transitioning Benson into his new home and provide support. Benson has had a tremendously difficult life but he is ready to find love and support in a family who loves him. Benson was rescued from a shelter in Los Angeles, CA and is being fostered in Eugene, OR. Will you be his hero?\n\nAPPLY ONLINE HERE: https://www.streetdoghero.org/benson",

He will not be placed in a home with children or other dogs. \n\nThis cutie is a 3 year old Yorkie who weighs approximately 10 lbs. Baz will be neutered, vaccinated, microchipped and vetted before adoption. He is house and crate trained. \n\nBaz is a boy who will be needing a very special home. He is a nervous and anxious boy in new and unknown environments and will need patient owners who are willing to work through his issues. Once he finds his person and connects with them he is a sweet boy. He just needs love, patience and stability to thrive. He is a fear biter so someone with experience in fear based behavior or willing to do the work to learn and help him overcome this would be ideal. For this reason Baz will need to go into a home with no children. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adopting Baz fill out an app at the link below \nwww.bullluvablepaws.org/adopt",

            "description": "Meet Elroy!  He came to us underweight, very mistrustful, with thin fur due to fleas.  It actually took him several days to warm to us, and still has trust issues with humans.  We're happy to report that with regular feedings and flea treatments, his fur is grown in nicely and he has put on some weight!  He's a high energy young adult, who loves to play!  He sometimes gets so obsessed with a toy, he'll actually \"guard\" it and can get snappy about it.  Due to his trust issues and resource guarding tendencies, he would do best in a home with an experienced human, and no small children.  He's turning into quite the handsome fellow of a nice, medium size!  Anyone interested in Elroy should plan on coming out to spend time with him several times, to really get to know him. \n Come check out Elroy and our other dogs available for adoption at 2650 Washington Blvd, Crescent City, CA 95531.\n\nPlease call us at (707) 464-7235 for additional information.  More photos of this dog may be available on the Dogs of Del Norte County Facebook page.",

See the bottom of this bio for more FAQs regarding our adoption process before emailing.****\n\nName: Blue Eyes\n\nAge: 6 years\n\nCurrent Weight: 32 lbs\n\nRescued from: Texas\n\nHealth: up to date with required vaccinations, spayed, microchipped, Spine issue (is on pain meds to manage it but gets around fine!), Heartworm positive (SNARR covering treatment)\n\nAdoption fee: $300\n\nMeet Blue Eyes!  This little compact gal is fun loving, happy and ready for her next adventure. Blue eyes suffered a spinal injury that's inoperable, but is manageable with pain meds and does not slow her down one bit. She's never met a stranger and greets everyone she meets with whole body wiggles. Pictures don't do this girl justice..... when you see her you can't help but smile.  She has so much love to give and needs a family to spoil her rotten. Blue Eyes would not do well in an apartment. \n\nFrom Blue Eyes' foster mom: Blue Eyes is a really great, low maintenance dog! She\u2019s very friendly and loves to ask for pets and treats from the humans! It\u2019s hard to say no to her wiggling, waggling tail! Blue Eyes has a spinal injury that is well maintained with medication and does not slow her down, she gets excited for her walks when she sees her leash and sometimes likes to play with her ball. Blue Eyes is well house trained and knows basic commands. She walks well on her leash! This pretty girl is smaller than her pictures let on and she enjoys laying near her humans. Blue Eyes would do best in a quiet, relaxed home without children.\n\nTo apply to adopt Blue Eyes, fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $375 for adults. Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n",

My foster parents call me \u201cPencie\u201d for short. I\u2019m a 6-7 month old Great Dane/Hound mix. I\u2019m going to be a really sweet BIG boy.  \n\nI\u2019m just a happy go lucky, go with the flow kind of fella?. I\u2019m kinda clumsy with my huge feet. I get along with all my foster brothers and sisters. Some are smaller than me and some are bigger (for now).  I need a home with older kids ( if any) at least 10 years or older. I don\u2019t do well with humans smaller than me. I would probably do best in a home with a sibling because I love to play with my buddies.\n\nNylabones are a must. I love to chew on toys and keep my teeth clean. Ice cubes are one of my favorite treats. I use the doggy door to go outside and do my business. I stay in my crate while my foster parents are at work but they let me stay out at night because I do really good. I mind really good and want you to be pleased. I love attention. \n\nI have had all of my shots and heart worm preventative. I am neutered and microchipped. My adoption fee is $150. Try me on a home visit for a week. I will melt you with my droopy eyes. I\u2019m ready to find my forever family and start the new year right.",
