            "description": "Yeti is living in a foster home. Submit an application from our website and then make an appointment to meet her.\n\nYeti is not eligible for foster and will be a straight adoption.\n\nAge: ~1 year\nWeight: ~63lbs\nHousebroken: Working on it! She needs to be on a strict schedule \nCrate trained: Working on it! Takes 10-30 minutes to settle and would benefit from continued training \nDog sociability: Reportedly dog-friendly from prior shelter. Hasn't had close interaction with dogs in our care yet, but she seems excitable/friendly when she sees them from a distance on walks. May pull/jump when she sees them.\nCat sociability: Unknown\nKids: Unknown\nIdeal home: Yeti is adaptable to many spaces, but would prefer to not live in an elevator/high-rise building. She is reported to be able to climb fences, so if she's in a home with a yard she needs to be monitored. She may do well with a dog pal in her home or access to doggy daycare.\n\nYeti is a mushy, sweet, calm, snuggly lady! She loves to curl up and nap on the couch but is always down for a frolic in the snow. She enjoys walks but can definitely settle down when you want to. She is so gentle and doesn't care about people being in her personal space. She warms up to new people very fast and loves quickly and loves hard! She is a lovely lady and her most favorite activity is just hanging out with you. \n\nYeti's adoption fee is 300. She will be spayed on a future date (2/4/21) and a 50 refundable spay deposit will be required. She is up to date on core vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative.\n\n***We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications. We ask that you please be patient and someone will be in touch via email within 72 hours. Please do not email us unless you have not received a response in 72 hours. Please only fill out one adoption application. ***",

Grizzley has been to a professional trainer and his leash skills are greatly improved.  He is fence reactive to other dogs, but tends to get along with others when properly introduced.  We do not recommend small children and a quieter family life will be more suited to his disposition.  He will need a fenced yard to allow him to wear off his boundless energy.  Grizzley weighs 76 lbs. but is still maturing.  \n\nIf you would like an application go to our website (https://humanesocietypc.com/) and download one and email it back as a Word or PDF document. Please no Google documents.\n\nThis dog's adoption fee is $190. That fee includes spaying/ neutering, microchipping, deworming and vaccinations. \n",

            "description": "Dante is a sweet boy who is bubbling over with a pure joy for just being alive. There\u2019s rarely a moment where he isn\u2019t enthusiastically wagging his tail or looking for someone to give kisses to. He loves his foster humans, and he is not shy at all at when it comes to loving any new human he meets, either. He will come right up to you and curl into your lap, and it will be love at first snuggle! \nHe adores his foster fur-siblings and likes to roughhouse with them when it\u2019s wrestle time, but he\u2019s always ready to cuddle up with them for naps too. He loves going to the dog park to meet new friends, and he\u2019s been an absolute darling to everyone he\u2019s met so far. He\u2019s great with all other dogs, and wonderful with kids. He has not been tested with cats yet, but we do know that he likes to chase birds. \nDante was found in a rural area in Louisiana, and it doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s ever had any owners. He is working hard on learning how to potty train and sit. His ears go straight up when he know he\u2019s a good boy, and down when he knows he did a naughty. He is eager to please and he loves treats. He needs someone who will be patient with him while he learns to be his best self. \nDante\u2019s exact age is unknown, but he\u2019s estimated to be about 1 year. So while he might fill out a little, it\u2019s unlikely he\u2019ll grow too much past his dainty 25 pounds. His breed is unknown, but whatever his mix is, his foster family thinks it\u2019s pretty perfect. \nIf you are looking for an adorable best friend who is going to love you unconditionally and kiss you all day long, Dante is the guy for you!\n\nPlease note: as with most rescue puppies, we have no way to guarantee this puppy\u2019s breed or size potential. \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for puppies covers initial deworming,  puppy vaccinations, microchip, and spay/neuter at the rescue's approved vet at 6 months of age. Please see our website for more information.\n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq\n\n*Any breed labels used by Take Paws Rescue, its employees/volunteers, or on vet records provided cannot be guaranteed.  Breed labels are given based on information obtained during intake and/or best guesses based on appearance and/or temperament of the dogs and Take Paws Rescue gives no assurance to the accuracy of these labels. Labels are necessary for postings to many animal networking sites, such as Pet Finder, and are no way a guarantee. Additionally, exact age and potential size cannot be guaranteed.",

She is great with all people and yearns for attention so would do best in a home where someone is not gone for long hours at a time. She is definitely a lap dog/ cuddle buddy/ partner in crime who wants nothing more then to be by her persons side.  She also loves to sleep with her person and even makes nests and snuggles under the covers to stay warm. She does do well with other dogs but has yet to try and play with them. She prefers calmer dogs that don\u2019t jump on her and aren\u2019t too overly hyper. She also does well with cats. \nRanger is working on potty training and is doing well as long as she is taken out often. She is also HW negative and on preventative, up to date on shots, microchipped, and all healthy and ready to find her forever person/ family. If you are interested in Ranger please fill out an adoption application for consideration found on our website www.cubbyscrusade.org under the forms tab. \n",

Goldie's owner sadly passed away and there was no family available to take her and the other pets. Goldie was understandable nervous and sure when she first arrived at the adoption center but has slowly become used to our staff. Goldie is now a big talker and lets everyone know that she wants attention. Goldie does seem to have an issue with mops and brooms and will need a home that will not make her help with the cleaning. Goldie is not leash trained, she will need someone who is willing to work with her on training.\nIf you are interested in adopting this pet please fill out an adoption questionnaire at www.yakimahumane.org. A Yakima Humane Society staff member will contact you once your questionnaire has been received.\n\nIf you would like to adopt this pet you can fill out an online adoption form at www.yakimahumane.org. Please give the name and ID number for the animal you wish to adopt.\nIf you are thinking about adding a pet to your family, be a hero, please consider adopting a shelter pet and if you already have pets \u2013 for life\u2019s sake \u2013 spay and neuter. Spaying and neutering your pets is the single most important thing you can do to help decrease our nations severe pet overpopulation.\n*NOTE: Nearly 90% of the animals that come into our shelter are abandoned, neglected, traumatized, injured, or ill. We attempt to give our best assessment of the animal\u2019s welfare and temperament. Unfortunately, due to lack of funding, volunteers, and resources our physical and mental assessment of the animal is not always 100% correct.",

Your adoption donation goes toward the cost of this vet care as well as other incidental costs of care.\n\nHISTORY: Motley Zoo Animal Rescue was asked to find Cody a great forever family and that is exactly what we plan to do!\n\nNOTES FROM CODY'S FOSTER HOME: Cody is a sweet, affectionate and well-trained boy who loves his people and playing ball. He is really an amazing dog- however, he is extremely fearful of new people and places. He tends to take cues from other dogs and we feel a companion dog in the home will help him, and he also needs a patient family so he can gain some confidence.\n\nCody is obedience trained, housebroken and fantastic in a crate, and will appropriately bark at strangers/ noises. When people come over however, he needs time to warm up- but throwing the ball expedites that process significantly!\n\nThis big boy looks so happy and comfortable when playing and this is one of the best ways to relax and exercise him.\n\nBecause of his lack of confidence and nervousness around strangers, he will need to be in an adult-only home that has prior strong breed experience and will need further training on his confidence (we have a class for that!).\nCody is not for a first-time dog owner.\n\nWe also feel he will not fare well in an apartment/condo/townhome setting and requires a fenced yard so he can play and run where he feels safe. We hope his new family will challenge his fears and help work him through them in time.\n\nFoster Update: Cody is easy and sweet with those he knows, but he is VERY fearful and guarded with strangers, especially men. He has fully bonded with and trusts my husband and me- but he will require some careful oversight when visitors come and interact with him.\n\nAll dogs adopted from Motley Zoo come with a leash and Martingale collar (or a harness, if necessary), depending on each dog's particular needs.\n\nABOUT MOTLEY ZOO:\n\nMotley Zoo Animal Rescue is a volunteer run, foster based, 501(c)(3) non-profit animal rescue organization based in Redmond, WA. Motley Zoo does not have a traditional shelter location, but instead, utilizes private foster homes which care for the animals individually, in a home environment, until a \"furever\" home is found.\n\nMotley Zoo also runs \"Rock Star Treatment\" Dog Daycare & Services Studio in Redmond, WA which is a day-use facility and does not hold kennels of adoptable animals. The dogs there are owned animals who come to the facility while their families are at work and school so they can play and socialize in a safe environment. We dub this service our \"Year-round\" fundraising program which helps us support our rescue animals and the $15,000/ month vet bills we incur.\n\nPlease email adopt@motleyzoo.org and request an adoption application so we can get you started on the journey to finding a new, furry friend! Once you have been approved to adopt, then we can set up a meeting with the animal you have been matched with.\n\nFor more information, please visit www.motleyzoo.org.\n\nThank you for considering adopting a dog in need!\n\nWoof,\n\nThe Motley Zoo Crew\n\n2/2/21 4:05 PM",

Bear is a sweet affectionate pup who would love a forever home. He is great with people and other dogs, but really likes to chase cats, so he would do best in a no cat home with a secure yard. Bear has been in a house before and didn\u2019t have any potty accidents, he\u2019ll go in a kennel but doesn\u2019t like to stay in it long or he\u2019ll voice his opinion on the matter and whine or bark to be let out. Bear is up to date on all shots and preventative, heartworm negative, and will be neutered soon. His adoption fee will be $50, please let us know if you\u2019d like to meet him.",

If I was a dessert, I'd be a Mexican Hot Chocolate cookie...a sweet treat with a little spice. My perfect day would include a long walk outside in the sunshine followed by a good movie curled up on the couch with you. I'd love to have a family that will take me on adventures and love on me. If you like spirited sidekicks when we'd be a great team! \n\nI am good with some dogs, but I prefer females. A dog-to-dog meeting will be required so that I can meet my future brothers/sisters before going home! I would be best with children over 15 years of age and I am not a fan of being picked up/carried around. \n\nIf you are interested in Milo, please fill out an adoption application online through our website, foothillshumanesociety.org.",

Levi needs some work on his puppy manners, he is still so happy to see you he wants to jump right into your arms! We are willing to bet this clever boy will learn quickly though.\n\nLevi is 2 years old, 60 pounds, up to date on his shots, and heartworm positive. Fear not though! Once he's through his heartworm treatment he will be ready to take on a lifetime's worth of adventures with you.",

I haven't had a whole lot of life experience so I'm looking for an adopter who can show me the ropes. I can be nervous with new places and things but with some patience and love, I'll be your best friend! I will need to have a meet & greet here at the shelter with any dogs who may be living in your home to make sure when we will get along. When it comes to kids, I would do best in a home where everyone is at least 8 years old! That way they are old enough to understand how to be gentle with me as I settle into my new home. I just need an adopter with the time and love to dedicate to me and I promise I'll be the best pal ever! Come by and meet me soon!",

This goofy guy loves the outdoors, he's super playful and affectionate once he gets comfortable. He will need adopters with time to dedicate to his training and building up his confidence. Since he is still so young, he has a lot to learn about life. With some love and dedication we know he will make a great companion. We ask that any children in the home are at least 6 years old. Please bring any dogs you may have in for a meet and greet to see if they are a good match for Rambo. If you are interested, stop the SPCA and meet this sweet boy today!",

Hooch has one very specific requirement for his adoption: to sleep in bed with his humans! This very good boy is a 10 week old, 7.2 pound, Pug/Cavalier mix (best guess), seeking a perfect fit for his forever family. Hooch is a happy boy who loves to play with other dogs and says having a dog friend in his new family would be ideal. He is working on leash and crate training, but needs your consistency and guidance to master these things. Hooch enjoys outside time, and is always ready for an adventure, so an active family would be best for him. Hooch is pretty chill for his age, and enjoys snuggle and cuddles after the long day of play. He loves stuffed animals, squeaky bones to chew, and the like. If you feel like Hooch is the perfect fit, apply to adopt today!\n\nInterested in adopting? Take the first step and complete an adoption application on our website: http://aarf-tn.com/adopt/adoption-apps/\n\nIf you have questions that are not covered in the profile, visit the Pet Inquiry Form: http://aarf-tn.com/contact/pet-inquiry-form/.\n\nTHIS PET IS FOSTERED IN TENNESSEE! We do list and adopt our pets nationwide. Typical transport cost to the Northeast is $160. Due to interstate adoption regulations, we are not able to adopt to RI and MA state residents.\n\nA.A.R.F. (All About Rescue and Fixin' Inc.) http://aarf-tn.com/ is a non-profit, 501(c)(3) no kill animal rescue organization located in the Upper Cumberland area of Tennessee. A.A.R.F. is comprised of unpaid volunteers and survives only on public donations. Thank you for thinking adoption first!\n\nPrior to adoption, all canines and felines are spayed or neutered, have received their age appropriate vaccinations, have been de-wormed for common parasites, and have received treatment for prevention of fleas and ticks. All canines over the age of 6 months have been tested for heartworm. All canines are put on heartworm prevention as soon as possible - this means dogs as soon as they are tested negative. Puppies are put on prevention immediately. All felines, regardless of age, have been tested for Feline Leukemia/FIV. Each animal receives a health check by a licensed veterinarian prior to adoption. Anything else found will be treated by our organization prior to adoption.",

I am still unsure about meeting new people, but once I warm up to someone, I'm a total cuddle bug. I like to sit in laps and guilt my people into remaining seated until I'm ready to wake up from my nap. I've done ok meeting other small dogs, but I may have never met a large dog, cat or kid, so I'll need slow introductions to all those.

I am not fond of a cable tie and not a fit for an invisible fence. I may match with another dog, pending a meet and greet. I am not looking for a playmate or to be a playmate. I would enjoy the company of another dog with a similar type personality as mine. I should be fine with cats, with a slow positive introduction.\n\nI would enjoy daily walks after I have acclimated to my new home. I will be nervous with car rides but with the right introduction to it, I may learn to enjoy it. I am not a high activity guy, but do not mind a little excitement every once in a while.",

Otherwise, I am happy, energetic and affectionate.\n\nI need some leash work, and would do best with a physically fenced in yard. I may have a bit of a prey drive; a fence would keep me contained. I may be too timid for an invisible fence, and I am not a fit for an apartment.\n\nI am best suited with older children 10+. I may match with another dog pending a meet and greet. I have not greeted all dogs the best at the shelter and would be best suited with male dogs. I have not been fully tested with cats, but I do have a Terrier prey drive. Use caution.\n\nI am very smart. In a home with less commotion around me, I should pick up on things quickly.",

I am very site driven, so as things are moving, I get worked up. I calm down with calm voices and pets, but the shelter is not where I want to be.\n\nI am best suited with children 10+ and a physically fence in yard. I am not a fit for an invisible fence or an apartment. I may match with another dog, pending a meet and greet. I have not been tested with cats.\n\nI am a smart boy and will sit for a treat. I will need more leash training and home with less commotion. I do have a lot of energy, and will enjoy going for walks once I\u2019ve had time to adjust to my new surroundings.",

She's looking for a home where someone will be home full time with her. She loves to be on a lap or held all day long. She will not be happy in a home with someone who works full time. \n\nWinnie is in a foster home with other dogs but, doesn't really play with them. She does not play with toys much either. She's much more concerned with her person. She is the definition of a Velcro dog. She does use pee pads. \n\nWinnie is spayed, fully vaccinated, microchipped, heartworm negative and on prevention.\n\nAdoption Fee: $300\n\n***We require a complete and approved application before setting up a meet n greet.***\n\nTo apply to adopt just copy and paste the link into your search bar!\nhttps://fs24.formsite.com/oneatatimek9rescue/form1/index.html",

He loves to play with the little puppy, but is respectful of the elderly dogs and those who don\u2019t want to play.  He can jump a 5 foot chain link fence, but the only time he has tried is when we had workers over and he went to visit them. He has access to a doggy door and usually always stays inside the fence but be aware of this if home alone, he may go visiting if access to a doggy door.  He will stay in a crate. Takes treats nicely and waits his turn.  He has been around children 11 and up and been fine.  Feel like he would do okay with younger kids with appropriate boundary issues (no tail pulling or laying on him). \n\nBehavioral issues: Has ability to jump a 5 ft fence but has only tried once to visit people. \nMedical issues: Superficial wound on head \n\nHISTORY: Lucky was found with another dog that was dead, shot in the head. Lucky appears to have been shot in the head also but looks like it grazed him but he is at the vet and will be checked out. \n\nAdoption fee: $200 \nLocation: El Dorado KS foster\nPlease apply to adopt at www.tinyurl.com/adopthaa",

He does have a lot of energy so would be best for another pup and children 14+. Tank is looking for a foster to adopt home while he awaits his neuter surgery. He is looking forward to being a central part of an active family.\nxxx\n\nPlease note: \n\nWe are not currently adopting to Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maine or Rhode Island due to burdensome regulations involved with importing an animal.\n\nInterested in adopting?

            "description": "Randall is a male seven week old lab/shepherd mix puppy born approximately 12/14/2020. He comes from a litter of puppies that were being given away at days old when their mom stopped nursing due to an infection. A Good Samaritan helped them along until \u201cThe Big Three\u201d (named after \u201cThis Is Us\u201d) found their way to Take Paws. Randall has been dewormed and had his first round of puppy vaccines. He will be microchipped before going home. He will be neutered at 6months, which is covered by the rescue.\nRandall is a playful explorer. He loves to find new toys, but also loves some chill, snuggle time with his foster mom or siblings. He has unique brindle stripes on the softest puppy fur. Eventually he will probably medium-large sized. He is working on crate training and using a potty pad. Randall can\u2019t wait to be find his forever family and be part of an \u201cus\u201d! This sweetheart is ready for a forever home!\n\nPlease note: as with most rescue puppies, we have no way to guarantee this puppy\u2019s breed or size potential. \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for puppies covers initial deworming,  puppy vaccinations, microchip, and spay/neuter at the rescue's approved vet at 6 months of age. Please see our website for more information.\n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq\n\n*Any breed labels used by Take Paws Rescue, its employees/volunteers, or on vet records provided cannot be guaranteed.  Breed labels are given based on information obtained during intake and/or best guesses based on appearance and/or temperament of the dogs and Take Paws Rescue gives no assurance to the accuracy of these labels. Labels are necessary for postings to many animal networking sites, such as Pet Finder, and are no way a guarantee. Additionally, exact age and potential size cannot be guaranteed.",

While he should be sad and pouty having entered rescue not long ago with a crushed pelvis and mangled hip, nothing slows him down or wrecks his happy mood. Lenny is mister sunshine and rainbows and is always making everyone laugh with his antics. Even the sound of his voice and the way he talks back when you talk to him is funny. Lenny has a zest for life that some dogs might find annoying, so he would love to have another doggie friend in his forever home that is also playful and likes to wrestle and be silly. He has some herding breed in him so he tends to herd his people a little, so we think older kids would be best so he doesn't try to \"shepard\" any toddlers where they shouldn't be! He doesn't love being the kennel but will go in the kennel with treats and does quiet down if his doggie friends are kenneled next to him. He LOVES to eat and many times needs to be reminded which bowl is his, where his bowl is, to slow down, and/or that he still has food in his bowllittle ADHD! At night he loves to snuggle, which his foster mom loves. He loves all types of dog toys and will fetch and bring it back. He has learned to only chew on appropriate things now. He will carry the occasional shoe around the house, and just \"deliver\" it to one of his people without chewing on it, he thinks he is being helpful! He sleeps on a dog bed at night in his foster parents room and zonks out at night like a good boy. Sometimes you do have to watch out as he will sneak into the shower with you if you have a walk in shower, then your quick shower turns into a dog bath and shower for you! Lenny did have a Femoral Head Ostectomy surgery about a month ago to repair his hip and is currently working on some physical therapy to help that heal. He will most likely always have a bit of a wobble or limp in back, but that would not slow this guy down. He is truly one of a kind and everyone who has met him thinks he is hilarious when he gives them a little \"woodpecker\" with his nose to their leg when they are not paying attention to him!\n\n*Physical Therapy is currently being done at Granite City Pet Hospital in St. Cloud*\n\nIn the meantime if you have questions or are interested in me, please fill out an adoption application at www.ruffstartrescue.org.\n\nAn adoption application is the best way to show your interest in an animal.\n\nPlease check out our website, www.ruffstartrescue.org for more details and additional pictures on any of our animals!\n\nAll Ruff Start dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccines, microchipped, dewormed, and on monthly flea/tick and heartworm prevention (dogs) as well as heartworm tested (dogs).\n\nRuff Start Rescue is a foster based rescue.

            "description": "Ranger is the most gentle giant you will ever meet! He is a big love bug, and an even bigger cuddler. He is friendly with children, and big and small dogs. He is not too hyper, but does enjoy playtime and going to the dog park with his foster brothers. He also does great at doggy daycare in playgroup! We don't know anything about Ranger's background, as we rescued him from a high-kill shelter in Texas. However, we do believe that he was hit in his past. We believe this because if you move at him fast, he flinches. We think it was likely by a man, as he is slightly more timid around some men. He is still very social though! It is so sad, and he is still the most trusting, loving boy that we have ever met! We would prefer Ranger to find an adopter who is a female, or a family with a female present, as he is much more comfortable around females! While he is still very friendly with men, he is visibly more timid around them. Despite whatever may have happened to him, he still loves all people. Ranger does not have a single aggressive bone in his body. He is the single most loving dog that we have ever met!\n\nRanger is likely a Lab/Boxer mix. With almost any rescue though, breed is just a guess! He likely has a bully breed in him, so cannot go in a home with breed restrictions. Ranger is around 1-2 years old. He really is SUCH a sweetheart with all people and dogs alike.\n\nWith any rescue, moving from a shelter to a foster to an adoptive home can be very confusing. When an adopting family is sensitive to the challenges of change and acclimation for these dog's, the transition is far easier. A home with a very loving and nurturing family that understands that blossoming takes time would be perfect home for a rescue dog. Socialization, pure love and belly rubs is a gift to a dog that is undergoing a life change. Given the time and space, these dogs shine.\n\nFarfel's Rescue has found over time (we've rescued more than 3,000 dogs over 15 years of rescue) that families that attend level 1 group training classes or address individual challenges at home with one of our approved positive reinforcement/force free trainers keep their dogs for life. Dogs that do not get proper training and socialization have a much higher risk of developing behavioral problems. There is a bonding that occurs through the training process that can't be duplicated. It also teaches behaviors that enable a dog to go out into the world with excellent manners that create a very respectful relationship between dogs and their humans. It is for all these reasons that Farfel's isn't willing to adopt to a family that doesn't choose to create this training relationship. Farfel's is happy to provide a list of approved positive reinforcement/ force-free trainers in your area.\n\nRanger is up to date on his shots and neutered.\n\nRanger is available for adoption now! Applications are currently being accepted for our wonderful pup. If interested in this gorgeous, very cuddly/sweet and loving best friend, please fill out an application completely at http://farfels.com/farfels-rescue/adoption-form/ and submit.\n\n**PLEASE NOTE** If you're truly interested in adopting from us, please be sure to fill out our Farfel's Rescue adoption application found at the link above or at farfels.com. Adoption site applications such as Petfinder, Rescueme and Adoptapet don't provide enough information and therefore aren't useful. Our Farfel's application is the only initial tool that we have to determine a great match for this very deserving puppy. We're sorry, but in most cases, we're unable to get back to those that don't submit our Farfel's Rescue adoption application. Thanks very much for choosing rescue.",

She is active enough to be a jogging partner and lazy enough to be your cold weather lap warmer. She's just pint sized perfection! She is house and kennel trained, although she would much rather sleep in your bed in the bend of your knee. She is great with all dogs big and small, and pays no attention to the cats. Her foster does not have any kids but believes she would have no issues. Dinah will require a fenced in yard as she loves to run and is very fast. She is spayed, UTD on vacc., microchipped, and kept on monthly preventative. To apply to adopt visit\nwww.handsofhoperescue.com/adoptapp\n.",

            "description": "Kevin is a male seven week old lab/shepherd mix puppy born approximately 12/14/2020. He comes from a litter of puppies that were being given away at days old when their mom stopped nursing due to an infection. A Good Samaritan helped them along until \u201cThe Big Three\u201d (named after \u201cThis Is Us\u201d) found their way to Take Paws. Kevin has been dewormed and had his first round of puppy vaccines. He will be microchipped before going home. He will be neutered at 6months, which is covered by the rescue.\nKevin is the biggest  of the siblings and a total love bug. His favorite things to do are snuggle, sleep, and eat (like any good puppy!). He has the absolute softest puppy fur! Eventually he will probably medium-large sized. He is working on crate training and using a potty pad. Kevin can\u2019t wait to be find his forever family and be part of an \u201cus\u201d! This sweetheart is ready for a forever home!\n\nPlease note: as with most rescue puppies, we have no way to guarantee this puppy\u2019s breed or size potential. \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for puppies covers initial deworming,  puppy vaccinations, microchip, and spay/neuter at the rescue's approved vet at 6 months of age. Please see our website for more information.\n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq\n\n*Any breed labels used by Take Paws Rescue, its employees/volunteers, or on vet records provided cannot be guaranteed.  Breed labels are given based on information obtained during intake and/or best guesses based on appearance and/or temperament of the dogs and Take Paws Rescue gives no assurance to the accuracy of these labels. Labels are necessary for postings to many animal networking sites, such as Pet Finder, and are no way a guarantee. Additionally, exact age and potential size cannot be guaranteed.",

            "description": "King joined us with his packmates from our \"Missouri 11\" dogs taken into rescue after their lifelong owner passed away.\n\nLike most of his former packmates, King has a great deal of formal training to his credit, but not a whole lot of life experience as a companion animal in a family home environment. He can be unsure of new people at first, but once he warms up to you, look out! He happily enjoys a good back rub and just hanging out on a comfy dog bed at home.\n\nKing would love a home with a dog buddy his size, but he is unknown around cats. He was bred to be a working dog and he is headstrong, so we recommend a home with no small children. Homes with older, GSD-savvy kids where supervision is the norm can be considered.\n\nUnfortunately, King has tested positive for heartworm disease and will need to undergo treatment. He is currently intact but will be neutered once he has recovered from heartworm treatment. SGSDR covers all veterinary care costs for our dogs until adoption.\n\nKing is currently searching for his foster or foster-to-adopt home where he can get his treatment completed, learn about life in a family, and emerge healthy, happy, and well!\n\nIf you think King would be the perfect temporary or permanent member of YOUR family, please apply to foster or adopt.\n\nOur Adoption Fees:\n-------------------\n\n*Dogs and puppies 12 months old or younger: $400\n\n* Adult dogs over 12 months of age: $350\n\n* Senior dogs over 7 years of age qualify for our \"Seniors FUREVER\" program! Seniors are special to us, so we offer two options: \n\n(1) If your heart has a special place for the seniors, you can adopt a senior dog for the regular adoption fee of $350 and this becomes a perpetual fee. You can adopt another SGSDR senior dog at any time from us in the future at NO CHARGE. \n(2) If you aren't sure about your future adoption capacity, you may adopt your SGSDR senior dog for a reduced adoption fee of $250.\n\nFor more information on adopting a Serendipity dog, please visit our website at any of the following links:\n\nhttp://serendipitygsd.org/adopt\nhttp://serendipitygsd.org/adopt/faqs\nhttp://serendipitygsd.org/adopt/seniors \n\nVisit us on Facebook for regular updates on all of our program dogs!  https://www.facebook.com/SGSDR/",

These folks work tirelessly to help dogs in need of help Northward to their new beginning! Scooter is nine pounds of adorable and is a lover! The first thing we noticed about Scooter is that he walks on the leash like a show dog who loves to prance. He has wonderful manners and is friendly with cats and people. He likes to puff up when he sees another dog, but we think that is mostly all show. We introduced him to the cats in the cat room and he ignored each of them! Scooter is a lover who is very dramatic and dainty. He despises the snow, he hates his paws to be wet and he loves to be inside. This little love is adorable and will do well in most homes with submissive pets. He is current on vaccinations, has tested negative for heartworm, ehrlichia, lyme and anaplasmosis and has received a clean bill of health from several vets. He is scheduled to get neutered on 2/3/21 at Palmer Vet Clinic and will be able to go home after that. This little guy is a chihuahua mix through and through. He has the most mournful bark and bray... it almost sounds like a skeksis from the dark crystal or a velociraptor! He quiets down after a few minutes in his kennel, but if he sees his person he will let you know that he upset about being left alone.  This little guy has got some pipes, but he is lovable, adorable and compact!   We'd love to help Scooter find his perfect match.",

He also has an old injury to one of his back legs. Possibly an old fracture. It's healed and does not cause him any pain at all. It doesn't slow him down one bit!\n\nCarlton has not had a great life so far but, that doesn't stop him from loving EVERYONE he meets! We took him to a big Volleyball tournament where there were hundreds of people and he had the absolute best day of his life!! He loves to meet people and wants to give everyone kisses. He sucked up all the attention he could.\n\nHe is housebroken and crate trained. He knows a few basic commands such as \"sit\" and \"down\". He loves car rides, balls, bones and a soft bed. He is very strong and working on leash manners. He does great with other dogs his size. He's very interested! We have not introduced him to smaller dogs yet. \n\nThis is a great dog looking for a best friend. He's obviously not been cared for much of his life but, we're gunna change that.\n\nHe is neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, heartworm negative and on prevention.\n\nAdoption Fee: $300\n\n***We require a complete and approved application before setting up a meet n greet.***\n\nTo apply to adopt just copy and paste the link into your search bar!\nhttps://fs24.formsite.com/oneatatimek9rescue/form1/index.html",

            "description": "Kate is a female seven week old lab/shepherd mix puppy born approximately 12/14/2020. She comes from a litter of puppies that were being given away at days old when their mom stopped nursing due to an infection. A Good Samaritan helped them along until \u201cThe Big Three\u201d (named after \u201cThis Is Us\u201d) found their way to Take Paws. Kate has been dewormed and had her first round of puppy vaccines. She will be microchipped before going home. She will be spayed at 6months, which is covered by the rescue.\nKate is probably the shyest of the siblings and a total love bug. She has the softest, fluffy fur. Her favorite spot is cuddled up on her foster mom or in a puppy pile with her brothers. Eventually she will probably be on the larger side of \u201cmedium\u201d, but for now she is the smallest of the litter. She is working on crate training and using a potty pad. Kate can\u2019t wait to be find her forever family and be part of an \u201cus\u201d! This sweetheart is ready for a forever home!\n\nPlease note: as with most rescue puppies, we have no way to guarantee this puppy\u2019s breed or size potential. \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for puppies covers initial deworming,  puppy vaccinations, microchip, and spay/neuter at the rescue's approved vet at 6 months of age. Please see our website for more information.\n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq\n\n*Any breed labels used by Take Paws Rescue, its employees/volunteers, or on vet records provided cannot be guaranteed.  Breed labels are given based on information obtained during intake and/or best guesses based on appearance and/or temperament of the dogs and Take Paws Rescue gives no assurance to the accuracy of these labels. Labels are necessary for postings to many animal networking sites, such as Pet Finder, and are no way a guarantee. Additionally, exact age and potential size cannot be guaranteed.",

            "description": "Timothy was found stray and never redeemed. He is about 10 years old and only weighs 18lbs. Timothy tested high positive for heartworms so we found an amazing foster home that would get him through treatment. He's now done with treatment and ready for a home of his own. \n\nHis foster reports he's crate trained but has had a few accidents in the house but he was on prednisone for heartworm treatment which can sometimes increase urination so most likely a side effect of that. He is good with other dogs, unsure of cats and he needs a calmer home so a home without small children is best. \n\nTimothy must be fed separately as he has some food aggression. It's okay to give him treats around others but he gets a little exuberant at meal times, so it's best he eats in his crate alone or in a separate room. Sometimes when dogs aren't used to getting what is needed for their care, they can develop these tendencies. He doesn't mind eating in his crate. \n\nHis foster mom says he needs a calm and patient home as he has likely been abused and neglected, but with patience he enjoys attention and is highly treat motivated. He is not yet confident on a leash but needs a securely fenced yard because he has been on crate rest and his foster mom hasn't had him out on a leash very often.",

            "description": "Meet two-year-old and 13 pound terrier Alex. He can be shy at first but as soon as he trust you he is your best friend and wants to be in your lap. He\u2019s very dog friendly and would make a great second dog. He can be needy and is desperate for love. He\u2019s doing well so far on house and crate training. He enjoys going for walks playing in the yard and lots of lap time he would make a great active companion\n\nThank you for reading about our awesome dog. All dogs came to us from different situations and we often do not know much about their past, but they are rescue dogs who deserve a second chance and need patience on their journey. All of our dogs our are in foster homes all across the bay area. \n\nThe first step of the process is you must submit an application in order to set up a meet and great or talk with the foster family. Once application is submitted the foster parents will contact you to chat more about the dog and make sure they're a good fit and can answer any further question. The application answers most of all of our questions and can best match you. If you do not get the dog you apply for we can use your same application for 90 days towards another dog in our care and simply forward your app to that foster parent. \nhttp://form.jotform.com/underdogca/dog-adoption-application\n\nAll dogs will be fully vetted (Spay/ Neutered, Micro chipped, DHPP and Rabies Vaccinated) and other possible vet care prior to adoption.\n\nThe adoption fee is $350 which is considered a non refundable donation\n\nvisit us at underdogca.com or follow us on FB and IG @underdogca\nhttps://www.facebook.com/underdogCA",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\nName: Millie\n\nDOB: 4/1/2017\n\nWeight: 40 lbs\n\nAdoption Fee: 375.00\n\nMiss Millie came into rescue about 10 months ago from Houston, Texas. While we don't know exactly what life was like for Millie, we do know that in her short 3 or 4 years, it was not good and people were not nice to her. Millie is what we would like to call a work in progress. Everyday she gains a little bit of confidence in herself, in the people around her and in her ability to just be a dog. Over the last 10 months in her foster home she has gone from a completely shut down and scared dog that only hid in the back of her kennel for days at a time to a dog that learned to initially trust her pack of dogs in the home. The dogs have shown her what to do with dog toys, how to run laps around the backyard, why its cool to bark at squirrels when they run up the trees and how to wrestle with them. Her current foster home does bring in new foster dogs and Millie does require slow introductions and needs her space while acclimating to the new dog. She likes to take meeting new dogs on her own terms and rambunctious puppies are not her favorite. That being said, having a dog or two in her forever home that can take her under their wing and continue to guide Millie on her path to confidence as a dog is key to her success and happiness.\n\nPeople is where it gets tricky for Millie. Her foster family spent months gaining her trust just to be able to touch her. She is still unable to be put on a leash, when she sees a leash she panics. She does love to be near her people now. She wants to be in the same room with everyone and will even sit near on the couch. She likes to sleep on a dog bed in her foster parents room at night with her foster siblings. Millie LOVES comfort if there is a pillow, blanket or soft spot on the couch, she will find it and burrow into the spot. When she is in just the right mood and everyone is calm, she will allow her foster mom and sometimes foster dad to rub her belly and scratch her face and ears. She will even flop onto her back, but it is always on Millie's time and at her pace. She always needs to be approached at her level and never from above her. She loves to be told how pretty she is and her foster family thinks she even smiles when they give her compliments! She is very food motivated, girl LOVES to eat. She is still working on taking treats from someone's hand, but she knows the sound of the fridge opening, the crinkle of the cheese wrapper or the dog treat container opening and comes running.\n\nMillie likes to play outside with her doggie friends and will come to the back door when called. When she comes back into the house she will want her person to step out of the way so that the doorway is clear for her and no scary people are in the way! She has many quirks and many of them are manageable and then many of them may start to go away as she continues to come out of her shell. She still loves her kennel, but no longer hides in it. She knows the command Kennel and will \"kennel\" when asked to. She also knows \"sit\" and we have been working on \"place\". A trainer has come out to Millie's foster home to work with her and will continue to invest time into Millie to get her on the right track to be successful in a forever home\n\nPlease check out our website, www.ruffstartrescue.org for more details and additional pictures on any of our animals!\n\nAll Ruff Start dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccines, microchipped, dewormed, and on monthly flea/tick and heartworm prevention (dogs) as well as heartworm tested (dogs).\n\nRuff Start Rescue is a foster based rescue.

Parth is a striking red merle coloration and he has beautiful intense and soulful green eyes.\nHe along with his 3 other siblings came from a dam who was a boxer mix.\nThese puppies are fearless and have been socialized in a busy household with children, cats and dogs.\nParth is by far the biggest pup of the litter, he will be a big boy when he is done growing up.\n\nBoxers are upbeat and playful. Their patience and protective nature have earned them a reputation as a great dog with children. They take the jobs of watchdog and family guardian seriously and will meet threats fearlessly. Boxers do best when exposed to a lot of people and other animals in early puppyhood.",

            "description": "Annie / Female / Approx. 2 years / 29 lbs / Beagle Mix / Mississauga\n\nMeet Annie! Annie is described as a sweet, calm and gentle companion that loves to be with her people. When not curled up at your side, her new favorite activities include napping, playing with her toys, running/playing in the backyard and going for walks. She gets so desperate for pets she will climb on you if she has to! She is the ultimate snuggly buddy and is always looking for warm places to sleep. She is in tune with her humans and often looks to them for guidance but can be stubborn at times. She has a classic beagle howl when encouraged by other dogs or even the tv!\n\nAnnie is nervous around new people and will generally tuck her tail between her legs when they approach. She is never aggressive but her body language suggests she prefers some space. After one week in her foster home she had warmed up to all members of the household. She will need multiple meetings with new people before she is fully comfortable. Annie has not spent any time with kids but seems to be very interested in them. Based on her personality, we think Annie would probably do well with respectful kids ages 10+.\n\nAnnie is medium energy and currently enjoys a shorter walk in the morning, lunch time walk and a one-hour walk in the evening. On leash she walks well but true to her breed she loves to sniff! Her family should allow her to follow her nose and/or introduce scent games at home to stimulate her mind. She does have a bit of a drive for small animals like rabbits though so she should be kept on leash at all times.\n\nAlthough she is never left for more than a couple of hours, Annie is crated when her people go out. She did rip up her bed once when alone and so again, it\u2019s important her family is home often and willing to help her overcome her anxiety. At night Annie will settle in her crate or on a bed next to yours so long as she can see you. Usually at most she takes 15 minutes to settle. She likes to shred things like newspaper and cardboard so for the time being, will need supervision or a puppy proofed space.\n\nAnnie is very intelligent but she is not treat or toy motivated. She will need support with basic obedience and learning some more commands. Annie would prefer a family who is home more often than not. She can likely adapt to any home environment but would appreciate a backyard to run, sniff, and enjoy the outdoors. She is fearful of loud or unexpected noises, so would prefer to be outside of the downtown core.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adopting Annie please apply at https://www.fetchandreleash.ca/adoption-info#adoption-form\n\nAnnie\u2019s adoption fee is $800.

I'm pretty vocal and have a lovely singing voice. I love mealtimes and will always accept treats. I'm a pro at playtime and I know we can have so much fun together. I'll need some training as I grow up but that can be a fun activity for us to do together! I think I'd be a good fit in a family with some playmates that I can grow up with (human or canine I'm not picky). Are you the right home for me? Come meet me at Woodford Humane or call 859-873-5491 to find out more about me! \n Primary Color: Brindle Weight: 8.8lbs Age: 0yrs 3mths 0wks Animal has been Spayed",

            "description": "Klaus is a goofy, boisterous, happy, and mischievous boy! He's incredibly curious and likes to run and explore. Klaus came into rescue underweight and suffering from ear infections and aching hips, but since he's been in rescue and getting plenty of good care, love, and expert veterinary attention, this boy is blooming!\n\nHe's up to about 70 pounds now and still needs more weight, so he is definitely a big boy. Klaus can be a bit of a bull in a china shop and needs an outlet (or several!) for him to burn off his energy. He's not your typical senior and has the energy of a much younger dog. \n\nHe is learning to play with the other dogs in his foster home and would do best with at least one companion dog to keep him company. Klaus is a sweet but headstrong boy and will need a firm but gentle hand to lead him. \n\nHis hips do seem to bother him from time to time, but he's improving, and he loves nothing more than to be rubbed and scratched there. He does fine on stairs and navigating the couch, but on occasion needs a little help getting into and out of taller climbs like up into the car.\n\nThis boy will do anything for the right treat and praise from his humans. He loves food (don't leave anything within reach, he may help himself) and is eager to please. He shows no signs of food or toy aggression. He was very interested in cats upon arrival to his foster home but has adjusted and, while still curious, respects that kitties are friends, not food.\n\nWe recommend a home where Klaus has easy access to a fenced yard and he would love to have a dog buddy (or kitty!) as well. He's proven good with his foster family's teenage daughter, but is unknown with small children.\n\nKlaus is a sweet boy with all the benefits of a senior with the energy and drive of a younger dog, perfect for families ready for a dog with established personality (and does he have plenty!) and still energy for fun.\n\n\n\nOur Adoption Fees:\n-------------------\n\n*Dogs and puppies 12 months old or younger: $400\n\n* Adult dogs over 12 months of age: $350\n\n* Senior dogs over 7 years of age qualify for our \"Seniors FUREVER\" program! Seniors are special to us, so we offer two options: \n\n(1) If your heart has a special place for the seniors, you can adopt a senior dog for the regular adoption fee of $350 and this becomes a perpetual fee. You can adopt another SGSDR senior dog at any time from us in the future at NO CHARGE. \n(2) If you aren't sure about your future adoption capacity, you may adopt your SGSDR senior dog for a reduced adoption fee of $250.\n\nFor more information on adopting a Serendipity dog, please visit our website at any of the following links:\n\nhttp://serendipitygsd.org/adopt\nhttp://serendipitygsd.org/adopt/faqs\nhttp://serendipitygsd.org/adopt/seniors \n\nVisit us on Facebook for regular updates on all of our program dogs!  https://www.facebook.com/SGSDR/",

            "description": "We are accepting adoption applications for Eva but she will not be able to go home until after her spay is done on Feb 23rd. This will also give Eva's prospective adopter(s) time to come and meet her a couple of times as she is a little on the shy side. Adopter MUST have a physically fenced yard due to Eva's shy nature. \n\nThis beautiful girl is Eva and she is a 1 1/2 year old Catahoula Leopard dog mix who weighs 45 pounds. Eva came to us from an abusive situation with one of her puppies (who has been adopted!) and was very standoffish and scared of everyone but especially of men. It took us several weeks to gain Eva's trust and get her to a point where she was comfortable being handled. She has been with us for almost 3 months now and has made amazing progress and has even done super well with meeting new people! \n\nEva is a super sweet and energetic girl who loves to be pet and to give kisses once she is comfortable with you! She loves to run and play in the yard and chase tennis balls as well as find sticks to chew on! Once Eva really starts to trust you she will roll over for belly rubs and will let you rub her belly for hours. \n\nWe believe that Eva would do well in a home with children as she seems to really open up to them but would of course need to meet any children in the home before the adoption was approved. We haven't had the opportunity to have Eva around dogs that were not her puppy but believe that she would do well with them and will need to meet any dog in the potential adopters home to make sure everyone gets along. We also haven't had the opportunity to test Eva with cats but can certainly do that if a prospective home has cats. \nEva's last owner told us she was housetrained and she does really well in her kennel with only an occasional accident at night. She does now the command sit and walks pretty well on a leash when she is wearing a harness! She also seems to enjoy riding in vehicles!\n\nIf you would like to set up a time to come meet Eva please give us a call at 641-774-5113 as we are open by appointment only. \n\nIf you would like to donate towards Eva's care please go to the top of this page and click on the Sponsor button. You will then be redirected to her Petfinder Sponsor/Donation page. Any amount is greatly appreciated!\n\nEva's adoption fee is $75.00 and that does include all of her Vet work.",

He\u2019s a low energy dude just looking for someone to snuggle and love him for the rest of his life. And give him Costco bones.?\n\nKeeper will be five in March. his entire world was shattered when his mom died in September and then his dad died in January. In six months, keeper lost everyone he knew and loved. This has caused some stress and depression in this handsome boy.\n\nBecause of the trauma he went through, he would do better in a home with older kids that can understand he will need some time to settle in. he is fine with children of all ages but his current foster home has 2 preschool age boys that can be a little overwhelming.  Even though Keeper tolerates it pretty well, we would like to find the best fit for him.\n\n4 year old male Pitbull Mix?\n\nBreed: Pit X   \nAge: 4 years\nSize: Large (60+ lbs)\nGender: Male????\n\nGood with:\nDogs: Yes\nKids: Yes\nCats: Yes\n\nFor more information and pictures, or if you're interested in adopting me, please visit:  www.boxersandbuddies.com.  All of our dogs are FAMILY COMPANIONS!\n\nOur adoption requirements are:\n\nWe only adopt pets within 4 hours of Reno\nYou must be 21 years of age\nAll current pets in the household MUST be spayed/neutered and current on shots (yes, we do call and verify this information)\nWe do not place female boxers with other female dogs\nAttendance at a professionally run obedience course is a requirement of adoption! \nWe do not adopt out dogs as gifts",

I hope you have been practicing your throwing skills!!!\nI am a BIG black beauty of a boy! The rescue thinks I'm 3 years old and the most and I appear to be a purebred English lab about 80lb. I was found as a stray in a rural area and everyone is super confused how a big sweet fella like me ended up out on my own, but, I'm ready for my next chapter in a forever home where we can live happily every after together!\nI have a lot of great stuff on the resume...\nI'm great with everyone! Dogs of all sizes (even the small ones that sass me), kids of all ages, and cats too (even the ones who sass me). I ride excellent in the car so maybe we can go on some adventures together! I am house trained and also know some commands like sit, stay, and lay down! I need some work on leash training but my foster mom says a Gentle Leader harness will help me learn!\nIf you're a Lab lover, then pick me, because I'm your Lover Lab and I'm looking for a date for Valentines Day!\nxoxo Kingston\n\nI am currently awaiting to be neutered, but I am available for meets until the big day happens, which is very soon!!\n\nCompletion of an Adoption Application via our website (www.RescueCrew.org) is the best way to show your interest in an animal and is the first step in the adoption process.\n\nAll companion animals adopted by The Rescue Crew are spayed/neutered, up-to-date on age appropriate vaccinations, tested for FIV/FeLK (cats) or heartworm (dogs), microchipped, dewormed and provided with monthly flea/tick and heartworm preventatives.\n\nThe Rescue Crew is a foster based rescue organization, meaning all of our adoptable pets are located in homes throughout Minnesota. We do not have a physical location where you can stop by to visit the animals - we require the completion of an Adoption Application prior to meeting any of our adoptable pets in foster care.\n\nFor the most complete information regarding this animal, and all of our adoptable pets, please ensure you are visiting our website directly at www.RescueCrew.org. You can also access the necessary online adoption application here as well.",

            "description": ",Due to COVID-19, all adoptions will be by appointment only. To adopt, complete our online adoption application and an Adoption Counselor will contact you within 48-hours to schedule your adoption appointment. Adoptions for any pets in foster will be completed offsite at our PetSmart Claiborne location on a case by case basis. The safety of our foster parents and community is of utmost importance to us and it will be at the foster's discretion if they'd like to meet at this time. Thank you for choosing adoption! \n\nTitus is an affectionate sweet guy who loves affection.  Despite his size, he thinks he is a lap dog.  He takes treats gently and walks nicely on leash,  Now all he needs is a loving human to call his own.  \n\nTo inquire about an adoptable animal from the Louisiana SPCA, please call 504.368.5191, ext. 150 to speak with an adoption counselor.\nTo see more adoptable animals from the Louisiana SPCA, please go to http://la-spca.org/adopt.\n\n\n\nThe petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n",

With any further questions please call our Brunswick Campus at 207-449366 ext. 206 or 207. Dear Santa, My name is Scarlett and what I want most this year is a new home for the Holidays! Don't get me wrong, I really like it here at the shelter, but I have been here since last February and I am really ready to find my new family and start my next adventure! I love to play with toys and once I get to know you, I can really be a love! I just want a friend to love me and snuggle on the couch. The outside world and new people scare me a little so you will have to be patient. I do have behavior friends at Midcoast Humane who can help me with my fears and adjust in my new home so don't worry too much. We will work through my fears together. Children do scare me a little, so I prefer human adults, please. I have been so good with other dogs, but please no cats. Do you know of a home for me? Love, Scarlett",

I would love a home with a fence so that I can run free, but it isn 't a requirement. I am very friendly when meeting new people and loved my stuffed toys! I 've done well with kids in the past, but if there are children in the home, I 'd prefer them to be 15+ years old, and I need to meet them prior to adoption. If you are interested in adopting me, please go to the adopt tab and fill out a Dog Pre-Adoption Survey. I look forward to barking with you!",

With any further questions please call our Brunswick Campus at 207-449366 ext. 206 or 207. Dear Santa, I'm Momo and I am the happiest girl around as long as you play ball with me! I really like to hang out with you at home but ohh I don't like other animals at all! They really scare me! When I was younger, I lived up North and was a guard dog, but I really didn't like that job. I just want a quiet place to call home with no kids or other animals. My own yard and fence would be \"the bee's knees\", so I never meet those scary off leash dogs anymore! They are so rude! I really do love everyone at the shelter, especially Tammy, but I have been here for almost a year and I really want to find my own home before the holiday. Do you know of a home for me? Love, Momo",

I'm hoping that I can get into a home with someone that would be willing to work with me, and help me learn about the world. I like the people at the shelter, and I don\u2019t mind when they pet me, and really like it when I get to have treats! I\u2019m comfortable enough to give face kisses, but all these loud noises are a bit much for me. I hope that I can find a foster to stay with to help me build some confidence in the world so I can become the perfect friend for someone. \n\nPlease let the people at SWCHS know if you think you have a good home for me to stay at. I'd prefer no other animals, but if there is another clam dog that is ok. No young children under the age of 14 please, and it would be best that I be in a house rather than an apartment. A fenced in yard is required, as I can run off when I get frightened.\n\nApply for foster at www.SWCHS.com or call 715-423-0505",

She has a medium energy level. A fenced yard is a must for this bouncy girl.\n\nManilla is fun-loving and cuddly too. She loves to hang with her people and play with her toys. She is seeking a family to have adventures and also snuggles on the couch. She currently lives at a foster home in Spindale, NC and is ready to go to a loving home on 2/12/2021.\n\nThe adoption fee is $300.00 and includes deworming, vaccinations, flea treatment, and local spay voucher at our clinic location. To adopt go to https://www.leeshorerescue.com/apply.html and fill out an application to adopt a puppy.\n\nAAS",

Lacie is an 8 week old tan and white female lab mix who was released to the shelter along with her siblings because they could not find homes for them all. Lacie is quite scared at first but doesn't mind being handled by the staff. Lacie would do well in a home with other pets since she is so young and would be a great companion for the kiddos! Lacie is not yet house broken or crate trained but with some training she can learn in no time!\n\nHer adoption fee is $59 and she can be microchipped for $8.25. Due to the outbreak of Covid-19 our adoption policies have changed. All adoptions are by appointment only. Call to set up an appointment to meet the animal. Dogs are $61.50 and puppies are $59 unless otherwise noted. All cats and kittens are $44 unless otherwise noted. Our system automatically updates petfinders every two hours. Feel free to email us with any questions you may have.",

            "description": "Hello!  My name is Roxy,  and I'm a female mixed breed born in November of 20xx.   \n\nMy adoption fee is $175.\n\nHanover Humane will only be adopting me to a home in Hanover County, Virginia or a locality that is part of the Richmond, Virginia metropolitan area.\n\nI'm a sweet, shy girl who, once I'm comfortable, will play and have a good time. I also like my down time and will lay quietly on my bed and chew on my nylabone. I'm not that great on leash, so you'll have to work with me on that. I love to have my ears scratched, and I adore it when you kiss my forehead. My biggest vice is that I like to chew up my toys, bedding, and blankets. I even had to have surgery to remove a blockage from my intestines when I accidently ate part of my blanket.  My new owner will have to be vigilant and make sure I don't get into anything like that that I can tear up.\n\n I've been neutered/spayed, am current on all of my vaccinations (DHLPP, Bordetella and Rabies), tested for heartworms (and am negative) and put on heartworm preventative, and microchipped.  My new owner will receive a month of free pet health insurance at adoption. \n\nIf you are interested in me or want to meet me, please submit an adoption application at www.hanoverhumanesociety.org and you will be contacted to make an appointment.",

            "description": ",Due to COVID-19, all adoptions will be by appointment only. To adopt, complete our online adoption application and an Adoption Counselor will contact you within 48-hours to schedule your adoption appointment. Adoptions for any pets in foster will be completed offsite at our PetSmart Claiborne location on a case by case basis. The safety of our foster parents and community is of utmost importance to us and it will be at the foster's discretion if they'd like to meet at this time. Thank you for choosing adoption! \n\nThis wonderful little guy is a little shy and needs a family who can help him gain some confidence.  He is playful but is a bit shy showing it.  He likes plush toys and with a little encouragement he will play.  He takes treats gently and likes affection.\n\nTo inquire about an adoptable animal from the Louisiana SPCA, please call 504.368.5191, ext. 150 to speak with an adoption counselor.\nTo see more adoptable animals from the Louisiana SPCA, please go to http://la-spca.org/adopt.\n\n\n\nThe petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n",

Dogs don't know how to share - it's not in their genetic makeup. Trinity did what most dogs would do - she guarded her food and bit the puppy.\n\nThe family decided to get rid of Trinity. We have since tested Trinity with a variety of dogs - she is fearful at first, but, when given appropriate introductions and some time to adjust, she is off and playing.\n\nWe wish people understood that introductions - especially when bringing a new dog into a current dog's home, need to be done gradually and positively to be successful. We know Trinity is a good dog that just needs some time and training.\n\nIs your home looking for a new family member?

We are currently working on house training and crate training. She is a playful girl who is looking for a family of her own and a home full of toys. \n\nOur adoption fee includes the spay/neuter, up to date vaccines, microchip, Interstate Health Certificate, and the transport service to get the new family pet to you. \n\n Note: All dogs are located in foster homes in ALABAMA and will be transported NORTH AFTER ADOPTION. This means there is no way for a meet and greet before adoption. We try our best to give you honest personalities of the pup for you. We are more than happy to send videos, pictures, and even video chat so that you may have the connection with your pup before adoption. Please know that we can only guess breed and age of our rescues.\n\n All pets are delivered by a licensed transporter. \nThe transportation company that we use is PETSLLC. They are well known and very professional. The link is listed, you are more than welcome to look and see what the closest drop off location is for you. \n\nhttp://www.petsllc.net/stops.php?route=9\n\n COMPLETED APPLICATIONS TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER INQUIRIES! If you are interested in adopting, the FIRST step is to complete an application!\n\n Please copy and paste the following URL for our adoption application:\n\n https://fs29.formsite.com/pickenscountypartnersforpets/form1/index.html\n\n Please be advised that our volunteers are busy rescuing, transporting, and caring for our animals. We will respond to your application as soon as possible. Upon review of your application, the rescue in Alabama will contact you, so you can ask any specific questions that you may have. \n\n If there is more than one decision maker in the home, all of them should be in agreement.\n\n We do not adopt to anyone under the age of 21.",

My mom is a 28lbs supermut from the streets of Tijuana, but I do not know who my father is, so I'm not sure exactly how big I'll be when fully grown. \n\n- I\u2019m a very very loyal boy who LOVES to just cuddle!\n\n- I am a full on puppy, so zoomies and chewing on everything are my main acidities during the day, other than full on naps of course. \n\n- I also love eating and running around in the house and playing with my humans and other doggos. \n\n- In just 2 weeks, I already learnt sit, stay, & am fully pee pad trained! I\u2019m such a fast learner!\n\n- I have also has been almost sleeping through the night in my crate, only waking up once for a potty brake. \n\n- I\u2019m a cutie and a sweetie and can\u2019t wait to meet my new family! \n\nIf you see me online I am still available for adoption! If you are interested in adopting me please fill out an application here: www.hitlivingfoundation.org/adoption-application, and email a video walkthrough of your home and yard to BOTH Nicole@hitlivingfoundation.org AND Marta@hitlivingfoundation.org.

It means that my front legs are splayed outward and it kind of makes me look like a swimmer! Or a froggy. But it doesn't hurt me, actually, I don't really even seem to mind it much at all. I would super duper like a family that just wants to give me snackies and spoil me with squeaky toys! I like other doggie friends and I'm sure I'd get along with kitty cats too! I just like everyone I meet! So, maybe come meet me today and fall head over heals in love with me. We can swim through this life together!

She came to us in November and has learned to allow human affection and to let people pet and touch her. Checkers has learned to walk well on a leash knows sit. Checkers is curious as to the game of fetch but hasn't quite caught on to it. Checkers is crate trained and very quiet.\nCheckers can be easily startled and her flight instinct is very high, the best home for her would be a more quiet laid back type of home. A fenced in yard would also be a huge positive for her new family. \nCheckers has never been around children, so our concern is that she could scare by the excitement and unpredictability of young children. Older more mature children would be a better fit.\nCheckers is fully vaccinated and microchipped;. She has an appt for her spay on March 8th. \n",

He was found with a lab mix named Harley and although they get along well together they are not a bonded pair and can be adopted out separately. Henry is all puppy, so get ready for a rodeo clown! Please remember that Henry is a puppy and puppy behavior comes with the package. They need basic training and potty training along with being provided chew toys to encourage proper chewing habits. All puppies require socializing from a young age to help them become the best, most well-rounded dog they can be.\n\nHenry will be available for adoption on 2/3/2021 at 5:01 PM.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this pet please fill out an adoption questionnaire at www.yakimahumane.org. A Yakima Humane Society staff member will contact you once your questionnaire has been received.\n\n\nIf you would like to adopt this pet you can fill out an online adoption form at www.yakimahumane.org. Please give the name and ID number for the animal you wish to adopt.\nIf you are thinking about adding a pet to your family, be a hero, please consider adopting a shelter pet and if you already have pets \u2013 for life\u2019s sake \u2013 spay and neuter. Spaying and neutering your pets is the single most important thing you can do to help decrease our nations severe pet overpopulation.\n*NOTE: Nearly 90% of the animals that come into our shelter are abandoned, neglected, traumatized, injured, or ill. We attempt to give our best assessment of the animal\u2019s welfare and temperament. Unfortunately, due to lack of funding, volunteers, and resources our physical and mental assessment of the animal is not always 100% correct.",

To adopt, complete our online adoption application and an Adoption Counselor will contact you within 48-hours to schedule your adoption appointment. Adoptions for any pets in foster will be completed offsite at our PetSmart Claiborne location on a case by case basis. The safety of our foster parents and community is of utmost importance to us and it will be at the foster's discretion if they'd like to meet at this time. Thank you for choosing adoption! \n\nThis very sweet girl is friendly and loves affection.  She has no experience on leash but walks nicely.  She would love to find a home where she can share her life with a loving human family.\n\nTo inquire about an adoptable animal from the Louisiana SPCA, please call 504.368.5191, ext. 150 to speak with an adoption counselor.\nTo see more adoptable animals from the Louisiana SPCA, please go to http://la-spca.org/adopt.\n\n\n\nThe petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n",

We are currently working on house training and crate training. She is a playful girl who is looking for a family of her own and a home full of toys. \n\nOur adoption fee includes the spay/neuter, up to date vaccines, microchip, Interstate Health Certificate, and the transport service to get the new family pet to you. \n\n Note: All dogs are located in foster homes in ALABAMA and will be transported NORTH AFTER ADOPTION. This means there is no way for a meet and greet before adoption. We try our best to give you honest personalities of the pup for you. We are more than happy to send videos, pictures, and even video chat so that you may have the connection with your pup before adoption. Please know that we can only guess breed and age of our rescues.\n\n All pets are delivered by a licensed transporter. \nThe transportation company that we use is PETSLLC. They are well known and very professional. The link is listed, you are more than welcome to look and see what the closest drop off location is for you. \n\nhttp://www.petsllc.net/stops.php?route=9\n\n COMPLETED APPLICATIONS TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER INQUIRIES! If you are interested in adopting, the FIRST step is to complete an application!\n\n Please copy and paste the following URL for our adoption application:\n\n https://fs29.formsite.com/pickenscountypartnersforpets/form1/index.html\n\n Please be advised that our volunteers are busy rescuing, transporting, and caring for our animals. We will respond to your application as soon as possible. Upon review of your application, the rescue in Alabama will contact you, so you can ask any specific questions that you may have. \n\n If there is more than one decision maker in the home, all of them should be in agreement.\n\n We do not adopt to anyone under the age of 21.",

I'm hoping that I can get into a home with someone that would be willing to work with me, and help me learn about the world. The people at the shelter are so nice, and I've become comfortable enough to let them pet me, and lay with me. I know that I can be the perfect dog if I could have someone work with me consistently in a calm environment. \n\nPlease let the people at SWCHS know if you think you have a good home for me to stay at. I'd prefer no other animals, but if there is another clam dog that is ok. No young children under the age of 14 please, and it would be best that I be in a house rather than an apartment. A fenced in yard is required, as I can run off when I get frightened.\n\nPlease apply at www.SWCHS.com to be a foster, or call 715-423-0505 \n",

Has a permanent head tilt which makes her that much more adorable. The vet thinks it is a vestibular issue which meds did not help but she doesn't let it slow her down. When I pick her up she leans to that side so when you put her down she doesn't go on her feet she lays down. I carry her with her head on my shoulder to offset the tilt so she does not feel off balance.\n\nShe does great in her crate at night and is keeping it clean.\n\nShe is one of the keeper pups that has you rethinking how many dogs is to many.\n\nShe is a 5 month old, 20 lb hound mix.\nAll SAAP animals are vet checked, UTD on vaccines, spayed/neutered, micro chipped, and given flea and heartworm preventative as age appropriate.\n\nOur website is: http://www.adoptastray.com/\n\nTo check if this animal is still available visit our master pet list on our website at:\nhttp://www.adoptastray.com/adoptable-animals/\n\nHave questions:\nPlease email us at saap@adoptastray.com for more information about this animal or to answer any questions you may have. You may also contact us at (859)391-1234.\n\nCompleting the online application when you find an animal you are interested in speeds up the adoption process. We can hold your application on file for a period of time if you are still looking for that perfect new family member.\n\nTHE APPLICATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS LINK:\nhttp://www.adoptastray.com/dog-adoption-application/\n\nINTERESTED IN FOSTERING:\nWe welcome your interest and ask that you complete our on-line foster application:\nhttp://www.adoptastray.com/foster-application/",

            "description": "\t\nMeet Kay, a one-year-old Siberian Husky mix.\n\nKay is a happy, athletic girl weighing in at 58 pounds. She will \"sit\" for treats and it appears as though she has had some training. This girl walks well on a leash and is very curious, she loves to sniff around and explore. Kay would make a great jogging or hiking buddy for someone. Please do your breed research before applying to adopt Kay, Huskies and Husky mixes are a very special breed of dog with unique requirements. They require a securely fenced backyard as they often have the inclination to roam and can be great escape artists. They need active homes that will help them burn off some of that extra energy along with a home that will work with them and help them learn and maintain their manners as huskies can have a tendency to be stubborn and mouthy at times. Huskies can have strong prey drives, and while every dog is different, many huskies will chase cats and livestock. Grooming is also an important part of their routine, brushing them several times a week can help prevent their undercoat from matting and keep them looking their best. Huskies are a fun, active breed that many have fallen in love with over the years, but please keep their breed needs in mind if considering adding one to your household.\n\nKay will be available for adoption on 2/3/2021 At 2:17 PM.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this pet please fill out an adoption questionnaire at www.yakimahumane.org. A Yakima Humane Society staff member will contact you once your questionnaire has been received.\n\nIf you would like to adopt this pet you can fill out an online adoption form at www.yakimahumane.org. Please give the name and ID number for the animal you wish to adopt.\nIf you are thinking about adding a pet to your family, be a hero, please consider adopting a shelter pet and if you already have pets \u2013 for life\u2019s sake \u2013 spay and neuter. Spaying and neutering your pets is the single most important thing you can do to help decrease our nations severe pet overpopulation.\n*NOTE: Nearly 90% of the animals that come into our shelter are abandoned, neglected, traumatized, injured, or ill. We attempt to give our best assessment of the animal\u2019s welfare and temperament. Unfortunately, due to lack of funding, volunteers, and resources our physical and mental assessment of the animal is not always 100% correct.",

            "description": "**PLEASE NOTE - FRAN AND MAX ARE A BONDED PAIR AND MUST BE ADOPTED TOGETHER. ADOPTERS INTERESTED IN FRAN AND MAX MUST HAVE DOG EXPERIENCE AND A FENCED-IN YARD**\n\nFran is an 8 year old spayed female German Shepherd Dog who weighs about 75 lbs. Fran and her boyfriend, Max, were rescued from a high kill shelter after their owner tragically died in a car accident. Sadly, these two beauties were part of a backyard breeding operation and were not given the care or attention they deserved for most of their lives. They are the sweetest pair who don't ask for much to be happy. After being forced to produce litter after litter of puppies for her entire life, Fran was battling a horrible case of pyometra when we rescued her. We were so glad we were able to provide her the care and surgery she needed in time. Fran also experiences some age-related weakness in his hind end, but she gets around just fine! As long as Max and Fran have each other, they are happy! They enjoy spending their days taking naps on comfy dog beds and exploring the yard. They are looking for a home with a fenced-in yard that they can romp around in and a family that is experienced with larger breed dogs. These senior couple would do best in a home where they can spend their days on one floor, as they do not navigate stairs very well. We absolutely adore this special pair, and we cannot wait to find them a wonderful home where they can spend their golden years - TOGETHER!\n\nInterested in adopting?

She is also very strong and can easily barrel over a small child unintentionally of course. Any children in the home need to be at least 12 years of age. Gabby has a rough and tough play style. She would need a canine friend that can tolerate her bossy play and has like play styles. When it comes to eating she never skips a meal and she tends to woof it down quickly. Her new family will need to purchase a slow feeder. We sell them here in our retail store and 100% of the proceeds go back to Gabby's friends. Gabby would love and active family to take her out on adventures to wear her out. if you are looking for a girl who is rough on the edges but sweet as sugar through and through, then stop what you are doing! Come meet Gabby today.",

They will continue to grow but we don't know just how big they'll get so any adopter should be prepared to love them if they stay medium sized dogs or grow up to be large dogs. They are terrier mixes but we cannot speculate beyond that. \n\nSierra and Nevada are reported to be human and dog friendly, potty trained though any adopter should be prepared for accidents until they get on a schedule and you get to know their signals, and ride well in the car. \n\nSierra and Nevada were found abandoned together as pups. They were rescued by a kind family that got them vetted and now are looking for a forever family for the two so we are giving preference to applications that will commit to keeping Sierra and Nevada together.\n\nUPDATE: Sierra (black) and Nevada (white/black) are an incredibly fun, bonded pair of girls who are terrier mixes, weighing 40 pounds each, and are estimated to be 7 months young. These two were found abandoned together as pups and the family that found them took them home, started their potty, crate, and obedience training, vetted them and are in good condition. These two are accustomed to living in a home and are a bit unsure as to why they are at a shelter. \n\nThey both ride very well in a car and once at my house, they became full of life running through my house, playing with toys, playing with each other, and they had fun having lots of toys to play with. They especially enjoyed tearing the stuffing out of toys, but also were content with playing with a few ropes and bones. \n\nThey are reported to be human and dog friendly (cats unknown) and appear to have a good start on their potty training as they knew the cues of \"let's go potty\", but they did have an accident in my home, but after all, they are puppies. So, they need some additional guidance with potty training, but seem to have a good head start on their training. \n\nThey both are treat motivated and know their basic commands, and Nevada will try to get on top of your counters so she will need some guidance in that regard. But overall, they both appear to be very smart and I believe these two will made a great addition to any family who is willing to take on the commitment of two young pups. Preference will be given to those committed to keeping them together.",

He is a very smart boy and he knows the word NO. He is super sweet unless it's playtime then he's all puppy! He's a talker and he will carry on a conversation with you. His potty training was going well and he is familiar with the words outside and potty. Also once he's finished eating he is familiar with the words that's all, no more. He is so much fun and would be great with a family with rowdy boys. He has been around other dogs and cats and did fine with them. Any potential adopter should be prepared for everything that adopting a young pup entails including potty training, crate training, basic training, and plenty of playtime and exercise to keep him happy and healthy! If you think Dooley would be the perfect fit for you, fill out an adoption application and send it to adoptions@hsdayton.org so our staff can review it, and if approved, we will contact you about setting up a time to meet with him!",

            "description": "\t\nMeet Alexo, a two-year-old Belgian Malinois/Shepherd mix.\n\nWe aren't sure of all the breeds that go into Alexo, but we do know he is a handsome boy weighing in at 59 pounds and only has half a tail! Alexo is a little unsure of everything new, he needs some work on his leash training and it's pretty clear he didn't know his breed mix was known to be guarding dogs (lol). However, Alexo is intelligent and has some energy so regular exercise will be important as well as stimulating his brain so he doesn't get bored.\n\nPlease do your breed research before applying to adopt Alexo. Belgian Malinois mixes are a special breed of dog with special requirements. These dogs were bred to have a job, and without the right activity level/purpose they won't flourish and that can lead to issues down the road. These dogs are incredibly smart and need to be challenged both physically and mentally to really be happy. The Belgian Malinois is known to be vocal when excited and can be a bit mouthy at times, proper training is key to help your Malinois adjust to their new life. Belgian Malinois are a fun, athletic breed that many have fallen in love with over the years, but please keep their breed needs in mind if you are considering to add one to your household.\n\nAlexo will be available for adoption on 2/2/2021 At 11:52 AM.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this pet please fill out an adoption questionnaire at www.yakimahumane.org. A Yakima Humane Society staff member will contact you once your questionnaire has been received.\n\nIf you would like to adopt this pet you can fill out an online adoption form at www.yakimahumane.org. Please give the name and ID number for the animal you wish to adopt.\nIf you are thinking about adding a pet to your family, be a hero, please consider adopting a shelter pet and if you already have pets \u2013 for life\u2019s sake \u2013 spay and neuter. Spaying and neutering your pets is the single most important thing you can do to help decrease our nations severe pet overpopulation.\n*NOTE: Nearly 90% of the animals that come into our shelter are abandoned, neglected, traumatized, injured, or ill. We attempt to give our best assessment of the animal\u2019s welfare and temperament. Unfortunately, due to lack of funding, volunteers, and resources our physical and mental assessment of the animal is not always 100% correct.",

I've gotten along with my play-yard canine friends very well, while staying in HALO's care. In my foster home, I also had gotten along well with their resident dogs, cats and children, too. I like to go for daily walks, hikes, or runs. I also love to go on explorations and spend time playing with you. My ideal family would be physically active and take me on adventures with them. I would love to show off my tricks like sit' and shake,' to you, especially if there are treats involved. If you think I could be a great fit for your family, please fill out the questionnaire here - https://www.halorescue.org/dogs and then call my HALO pals to schedule an appointment to meet me. I offer a life time of love and devotion and cannot wait to meet my new match.",

My current home has cats, chickens and goats, and I'm good at ignoring them and minding my own business. I love kids, they give the best kisses and drop the most snacks! Any strangers will get a warning bark, I want my family to know there might be danger. Will you give me my forever home? I promise to give you plenty of hugs and cuddles in return!",

He was originally found as a stray so we do not know much about his background. Fred is definitely a hopeless romantic who seeks out affection from the ladies (he opens up faster to woman then men). Fred is a gentle big dog, who enjoys going on walks! Fred seems to do fine with other dogs and we are unsure how he would do in a home with cats. Will you be the one to give Fred a chance? \n\nDue to COVID-19, Friendship APL is performing adoptions BY APPOINTMENT ONLY from 9:30am - 3:30pm, Tuesdays through Sundays. WALK-IN VISITORS ARE NOT PERMITTED. To schedule an adoption appointment, please email adoptions@friendshipapl.org.\n\nIf you have kids in your family and are interested in adopting a Friendship dog please bring them with you for a meet and greet.\n\nAll dogs receive one or more vaccinations, a basic veterinary examination, are dewormed, heartworm tested, and spayed or neutered. Dogs 3 months and older are micro-chipped.",

Dance Boogie came to us from the county shelter and now searching for a loving family to care for him forever. Dance Boogie is a friendly boy, though he may take some time to warm up. We recommend he go to a home with teens and adults who will allow him time to show his full personality. Boogie would be happy to be the only dog and center of attention, but if going home with a companion will need to meet first to ensure a perfect friendship. He has done well with other small dogs here with us. Due to being a stray, we do not know if Boogie is housebroken or how he is with cats. He does walk well on a leash and rides good in the car. Dance Boogie weighs in full grown at 14 pounds. He is neutered, up to date on vaccines, microchipped, licensed, and vet checked. His adoption fee of $300 includes a complimentary vet visit. To potentially adopt him, please come to our shelter location at 1102 W Hatcher Rd in Phoenix 85021, open Tuesday to Sunday 11am to 6pm. --Covid update: To adhere to CDC guidelines, we are open for adoptions only at a max capacity of 15 people in the building at a time.

We are currently working on house training and crate training. She is a playful girl who is looking for a family of her own and a home full of toys. \n\nOur adoption fee includes the spay/neuter, up to date vaccines, microchip, Interstate Health Certificate, and the transport service to get the new family pet to you. \n\n Note: All dogs are located in foster homes in ALABAMA and will be transported NORTH AFTER ADOPTION. This means there is no way for a meet and greet before adoption. We try our best to give you honest personalities of the pup for you. We are more than happy to send videos, pictures, and even video chat so that you may have the connection with your pup before adoption. Please know that we can only guess breed and age of our rescues.\n\n All pets are delivered by a licensed transporter. \nThe transportation company that we use is PETSLLC. They are well known and very professional. The link is listed, you are more than welcome to look and see what the closest drop off location is for you. \n\nhttp://www.petsllc.net/stops.php?route=9\n\n COMPLETED APPLICATIONS TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER INQUIRIES! If you are interested in adopting, the FIRST step is to complete an application!\n\n Please copy and paste the following URL for our adoption application:\n\n https://fs29.formsite.com/pickenscountypartnersforpets/form1/index.html\n\n Please be advised that our volunteers are busy rescuing, transporting, and caring for our animals. We will respond to your application as soon as possible. Upon review of your application, the rescue in Alabama will contact you, so you can ask any specific questions that you may have. \n\n If there is more than one decision maker in the home, all of them should be in agreement.\n\n We do not adopt to anyone under the age of 21.",

Please give the name and ID number for the animal you wish to adopt.\nIf you are thinking about adding a pet to your family, be a hero, please consider adopting a shelter pet and if you already have pets \u2013 for life\u2019s sake \u2013 spay and neuter.

To adopt, complete our online adoption application and an Adoption Counselor will contact you within 48-hours to schedule your adoption appointment. Adoptions for any pets in foster will be completed offsite at our PetSmart Claiborne location on a case by case basis. The safety of our foster parents and community is of utmost importance to us and it will be at the foster's discretion if they'd like to meet at this time. Thank you for choosing adoption! \n\nThis sweet girl is well mannered.  She knows the command sit and walks nicely on leash.  She is affectionate although she can be a little shy at first.  She warms up nicely and even gives sweet kisses. She enjoys affectiona and meeting people.\n\nTo inquire about an adoptable animal from the Louisiana SPCA, please call 504.368.5191, ext. 150 to speak with an adoption counselor.\nTo see more adoptable animals from the Louisiana SPCA, please go to http://la-spca.org/adopt.\n\n\n\nThe petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n",

She is a 10 month old yellow lab mix, up to date on vaccinations, heart worm negative, scheduled for spay on Feb. 11, and 38 pounds. She was surrendered by her owners. She is great with cats, dogs, and kids. She\u2019ll follow you anywhere you go, and enjoys being your shadow. She\u2019s playful and gentle. She knows sit, is house trained, enjoys running around the yard, and loves playing in the hose. She takes a minute to warm up, but is a quick learner. She prefers to be in your lap, but doesn\u2019t mind laying in her crate or a soft pillow next to you. This sweetheart is ready for a forever home!\n\nPlease note: as with most rescue puppies, we have no way to guarantee this puppy\u2019s breed or size potential. \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for puppies covers initial deworming,  puppy vaccinations, microchip, and spay/neuter at the rescue's approved vet at 6 months of age. Please see our website for more information.\n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq\n\n*Any breed labels used by Take Paws Rescue, its employees/volunteers, or on vet records provided cannot be guaranteed.  Breed labels are given based on information obtained during intake and/or best guesses based on appearance and/or temperament of the dogs and Take Paws Rescue gives no assurance to the accuracy of these labels. Labels are necessary for postings to many animal networking sites, such as Pet Finder, and are no way a guarantee. Additionally, exact age and potential size cannot be guaranteed.",

            "description": "\t\nMeet Yodel. a one and a half-year-old Husky/German Shepherd mix.\n\nYodel is a happy boy who enjoys going for his walks, a 70 pounds he is a great size to be your jogging partner. Yodel prefers to keep a clean kennel, however, as his name suggests he can be a talkative chap often singing the song of his people. This boy isn't sure what he wasn't to do, but he wants to do something! Yodel gets very excited when he sees other dogs so we do recommend a meet and greet if you have another dog in your house, prior to adopting Yodel.\n\nPlease do your breed research before applying to adopt Yodel, Huskies and Husky mixes are a very special breed of dog with unique requirements. They require a securely fenced backyard as they often have the inclination to roam and can be great escape artists. They need active homes that will help them burn off some of that extra energy along with a home that will work with them and help them learn and maintain their manners as huskies can have a tendency to be stubborn and mouthy at times. Huskies can have strong prey drives, and while every dog is different, many huskies will chase cats and livestock. Grooming is also an important part of their routine, brushing them several times a week can help prevent their undercoat from matting and keep them looking their best. Huskies are a fun, active breed that many have fallen in love with over the years, but please keep their breed needs in mind if considering adding one to your household.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this pet please fill out an adoption questionnaire at www.yakimahumane.org. A Yakima Humane Society staff member will contact you once your questionnaire has been received.\n\nIf you would like to adopt this pet you can fill out an online adoption form at www.yakimahumane.org. Please give the name and ID number for the animal you wish to adopt.\nIf you are thinking about adding a pet to your family, be a hero, please consider adopting a shelter pet and if you already have pets \u2013 for life\u2019s sake \u2013 spay and neuter. Spaying and neutering your pets is the single most important thing you can do to help decrease our nations severe pet overpopulation.\n*NOTE: Nearly 90% of the animals that come into our shelter are abandoned, neglected, traumatized, injured, or ill. We attempt to give our best assessment of the animal\u2019s welfare and temperament. Unfortunately, due to lack of funding, volunteers, and resources our physical and mental assessment of the animal is not always 100% correct.",

I'm the MOST adorable pup with the cutest white and black coloring and the sweetest \"love\" eyes. I adore every.single.human being. SO MUCH!!! I also enjoy the company and playfulness of other dogs, so if you have another dog that's a huge plus. I'd just love to meet them before heading home to make sure I'm not too much for them!! After I get settled from getting all the attention, I like to sprawl out on the floor and roll over. I am a bit strong and pushy with jumping so I would prefer an older children home so I don't end up hurting any young ones. If you enjoy playing and getting a little 'ruff' then I'm your guy! Come meet me and lets paddle on out of here. Primary Color: Black Secondary Color: White Weight: 60.6lbs Age: 0yrs 10mths 0wks Animal has been Neutered",

Spyro is very happy, he loves going for walks and does well on the leash but the leash tends to make him cough when attached to his collar so a harness would be best for this boy. Spyro just wants to explore and say hi to everyone, we think he is awesome!\n\nSpyro will be available for adoption on 2/3/2021 at 4:05 PM.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this pet please fill out an adoption questionnaire at www.yakimahumane.org. A Yakima Humane Society staff member will contact you once your questionnaire has been received.\n\nIf you would like to adopt this pet you can fill out an online adoption form at www.yakimahumane.org. Please give the name and ID number for the animal you wish to adopt.\nIf you are thinking about adding a pet to your family, be a hero, please consider adopting a shelter pet and if you already have pets \u2013 for life\u2019s sake \u2013 spay and neuter. Spaying and neutering your pets is the single most important thing you can do to help decrease our nations severe pet overpopulation.\n*NOTE: Nearly 90% of the animals that come into our shelter are abandoned, neglected, traumatized, injured, or ill. We attempt to give our best assessment of the animal\u2019s welfare and temperament. Unfortunately, due to lack of funding, volunteers, and resources our physical and mental assessment of the animal is not always 100% correct.",

It is clear some training went into Harley because he walks well on a leash and doesn't jump up on people in excitement. Harley was found wandering with Henry, a puppy, and although they get along well together they are not bonded and can be adopted out separately. Harley loves treats (big shocker there for a lab) and will \"sit\" for them, he is still working on taking them gently but learns fast. We adore this handsome hunk and know all lab lovers will also fall in love with this happy-go-lucky boy.\n\nHarley will be available for adoption on 2/3/2021 At 5:01 PM.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this pet please fill out an adoption questionnaire at www.yakimahumane.org. A Yakima Humane Society staff member will contact you once your questionnaire has been received.\n\n\nIf you would like to adopt this pet you can fill out an online adoption form at www.yakimahumane.org. Please give the name and ID number for the animal you wish to adopt.\nIf you are thinking about adding a pet to your family, be a hero, please consider adopting a shelter pet and if you already have pets \u2013 for life\u2019s sake \u2013 spay and neuter. Spaying and neutering your pets is the single most important thing you can do to help decrease our nations severe pet overpopulation.\n*NOTE: Nearly 90% of the animals that come into our shelter are abandoned, neglected, traumatized, injured, or ill. We attempt to give our best assessment of the animal\u2019s welfare and temperament. Unfortunately, due to lack of funding, volunteers, and resources our physical and mental assessment of the animal is not always 100% correct.",

Ransom likes to play with the other dogs but can act a little possessive of the person that is giving him attention. Ransom is a large boy who thinks he is just fine to jump into your lap. Ransom enjoys cuddling and will sleep right next to you at night. If you are looking for a very affectionate boy and you are willing to do some training, this may be the boy for you. Because of his size, need for activity and leadership it would be best for his new home to be an active, all adult home with a 6ft fenced in yard. \nIf you are interested in learning more about Ransom or meeting him, you will need to read our adoption process and THEN complete the online application at our website https://www.goldenrescue.com/adoption-process/ Please note we DO NOT adopt outside the state of Colorado.\n",

I am beautiful big boy with a medium energy level who just loves to be with people and give them all of my love and affection. I get along very well with other dogs, regardless of their size. While one of my absolute favorite activities is playing with tennis balls, they should probably be kept away from me because I have a tendency to eat them whole! I do have some other compulsive behaviors, like biting my own legs and tail, and while I have worked with many professionals, I can't seem to shake this habit. I am house-broken and crate-trained and I know basic commands. I also struggle with loud noises, like storms and fireworks, and can become very anxious when those factors are present.",

I am a very playful and energetic pup and I just love meeting new people and giving them tons of love and affection. I do require a lot of attention and would do best in a home where someone was always going to be home to keep me company. I love to play, go for long walks/runs, and am excellent with young children. I am still young so please keep in mind that I've got lots of energy to burn and need to find a family who can help me do that. I am house-broken, crate-trained, and I know my basic commands. I just love to be involved in whatever you're involved in. So if you're looking for a truly great dog with wonderful energy to join your family, you may have just found what you're looking for!",

I love to run around and play! I'm friendly and happy and just want to get to know you. Aside from having tons of energy, sometimes I can be loud, as I don't know how to control my barking yet. You have to remember, I'm a lot like a baby and have not necessarily adapted to a schedule yet so you may find that I'm staying up in my crate at night, and sleeping during the day. I need lots of direction and training, and that doesn't just mean puppy pre-school classes. I need you to show me the right and wrong things to do. Please don't be mad if in the process I wind up chewing some of your belongings or if I have accidents in the house - I promise I will get the hang of things! I require LOTS of time, energy, and patience, but my sweet little face makes it all worth it! This is a learning curve for us both but I promise that if you put the time and energy into helping me grow big and strong, you'll wind up with a wonderful little best friend for life.",

I was born here at Big Dog Ranch Rescue, along with my 5 littermates, to our loving mama Anastasia who was rescued from Puerto Rico before arriving here at the ranch to give birth to us! I'm a young puppy with lots of energy and spunk! I love to run around and play! I'm friendly and happy and just want to get to know you. Aside from having tons of energy, sometimes I can be loud, as I don't know how to control my barking yet. You have to remember, I'm a lot like a baby and have not necessarily adapted to a schedule yet so you may find that I'm staying up in my crate at night, and sleeping during the day. I need lots of direction and training, and that doesn't just mean puppy pre-school classes. I need you to show me the right and wrong things to do. Please don't be mad if in the process I wind up chewing some of your belongings or if I have accidents in the house - I promise I will get the hang of things! I require LOTS of time, energy, and patience, but my sweet little face makes it all worth it! This is a learning curve for us both but I promise that if you put the time and energy into helping me grow big and strong, you'll wind up with a wonderful little best friend for life.",

I love to explore and spend time outside, even if it is just napping in the sunshine. I also LOVE my chew toys. I've got medium energy but I'm super affectionate by nature. I play well with other dogs, regardless of their size but I think that I would be happiest in a home where I was the only pup around. I definitely need someone who can be active with me and take me for walks/runs every day to get out some energy. I'm also very strong and sometimes pull on my leash so beware! I am prey driven and will go after a cat or other small animal so a feline-free home would be preferred. I do have some food allergies that manifest in my ears but keeping me on a grain-free diet should take care of all of that. I am extremely loving and want all of your love and attention. If you can do that for me, I can promise to be the best companion for life!",

Stripe comes from a history of likely being abused, before he found himself at a kill shelter in rural Louisiana. Luckily, he\u2019s done with all of that, forever! \nWhile timid at first, once this little man (about 14 lbs) bonds with you, he will be at your side waiting to smother you with kisses. He will need a little time to come out of his shell but patience and a lot of treats will do the trick. He is potty trained, not a chewer and does not bark excessively. He really is the perfect companion for someone who is ready to give him the love he so much deserves.  \nStripe\u2019s energy level is perfect. He loves to play with his chew toy, jump and run around but he will settle down just as quickly. He loves to snuggle so he is the perfect companion to watch tv on the sofa or in bed. He is good with other dogs, already neutered, up to date on all shots and heartworm negative! This means, it\u2019s time for him to find his forever home! \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq\n\n*Any breed labels used by Take Paws Rescue, its employees/volunteers, or on vet records provided cannot be guaranteed.  Breed labels are given based on information obtained during intake and/or best guesses based on appearance and/or temperament of the dogs and Take Paws Rescue gives no assurance to the accuracy of these labels. Labels are necessary for postings to many animal networking sites, such as Pet Finder, and are no way a guarantee. Additionally, exact age and potential size cannot be guaranteed.",

He will need training and continued socialization since he doesn\u2019t quite know when to stop play, but he\u2019s very sweet. He also tries to pick up rocks when he\u2019s outside, so he\u2019ll definitely need supervised alone time as well.

Since she and her siblings were bottle fed from the time they were 3 days old, she loves people. She also gets along well with other dogs. Her beautiful, lush coat is black until she gets in the sunshine and then it shows highlights of brown. Gorgeous. She would make a great companion for your family.Contact us at straydogshelter@gmail.com for more information on this dog.",

            "description": "Age: 2 Months (as of 1/24/2021)\nWeight: ~ 8 lbs (as of 1/24/2021)\n\nThis dog has been spayed/neutered, is up to date on shots, on heartworm preventative and is microchipped.\n\nThe HappyDays pups are here to bring joy to your life!\n\nThese puppies are playful, even-tempered, and very affectionate! The litter is three adorable girls - Marion, Joanie, and Lori Beth and four handsome boys - Fonzie, Howard, Chachi, and Richie. We are thinking these cute babies are an Australian Shepherd and Carolina Dog mix. This litter is named after the classic tv show Happy Days that aired in the 1970s - 1980s. The pups love all people including the two teenagers that are living in their foster home. They are friendly and playful with each other but we don't know how they are with new dogs, but given that they are so young we anticipate that they would get along with a new dog sibling well. Their current foster home has two cats and they seem interested and playful when they encounter them but we can't guarantee they will do well as they grow older with co-habitating cats. They love toys and are happy to chill with a squeaky ball or fun chew toy when not playing with you, and t\n\nheir favorite play styles are wrestling or a fun round of chase.\n\nThe pups are pretty quiet but you might hear them bark when playing.\nThough a fenced yard is an ideal place for your puppy to romp and play safely, if that's not an option then lots of daily leash walks and opportunities to play off leash is the next best thing.\n\nPuppies are a lot of work and require a strong commitment to teaching them obedience and socializing them with other dogs and people. A well-mannered, obedient dog will be welcomed most anywhere you take him/her.\nAs the pups are still so young, they haven't yet started on potty training, crate training or leash training but think they will pick up these skills quickly as they seem very smart. All the HappyDays pups are eager to please, toy and treat motivated, so puppy training classes will be lots of fun!\n\nMarion would love to find a forever family that has lots of time and patience to raise a puppy properly, and who has lots of extra time for loving and cuddles. Think Marion (or one of her littermates) may be perfect furry addition to your family? Fill out an application today!\n\nHappyDays pup's Backstory: These pups came from an unplanned litter in Arkansas and have been in SOS foster care since birth. They are getting ready to make the ride to New England to meet their forever families!\n\nAdoption Fee: $585\n\nTo apply for this dog, fill out an adoption application on our website: www.sosarl.org/aa/\n\n**Additional info you should know - For most of our dogs, we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each of our dogs as an individual and do our best to describe and place them based on personality not breed label. Some dogs may not yet be in New England, nor ready for immediate adoption. There may be additional vetting, quarantine, waiting periods and/or fees depending upon your state of residence. If you have questions or concerns on any of this, you can discuss this with your Adoption Counselor.",

Aside from his giant joules and many wrinkles, he has the biggest heart! Goulash is a happy go lucky gentleman who walks well on his harness and leash. He enjoys being pet and loved on too. Goulash does best in a calm environment where he can get an occasional walk and midday nap! He was transferred to us from a partner rescue so his background is not too known. Goulash cannot wait to couch surf with his new humans!\n\nDue to COVID-19, Friendship APL is performing adoptions BY APPOINTMENT ONLY from 9:30am - 3:30pm, Tuesdays through Sundays. WALK-IN VISITORS ARE NOT PERMITTED. To schedule an adoption appointment, please email adoptions@friendshipapl.org.\n\nIf you have kids in your family and are interested in adopting a Friendship dog please bring them with you for a meet and greet.\n\nAll dogs receive one or more vaccinations, a basic veterinary examination, are dewormed, heartworm tested, and spayed or neutered. Dogs 3 months and older are micro-chipped.",

He is gorgeous, sweet, calm, and very loving. He is wonderful with our resident dogs, including one of our dogs who tends to be very leery of other dogs. Although he is a beagle, the ONLY time I have ever heard him bark is when we put him in his kennel but he always stops within 5-10 min and then is calm and quiet. Although he can initially be cautious in new situations he warms up fast. In a very short time, he has COMPLETELY melted our hearts and will be incredibly difficult to say goodbye to. He will be an amazing lifelong companion for a very lucky family.\n\nAbout Me: Hi everybody my name is Billie and I just made a very long trip from Alabama to MN to meet my furever family. One thing I can tell you is the Minnesota snow is AWESOME and I love to play outside in it. My favorite thing in the world is going for walks and my foster mom says I do really good on a leash. Since I came to MN I have learned how to walk upstairs, go potty outside, and EAT!! My mom says I was skin and bones when I got here but she has been fattening me up with lots of food and love. I love being near my humans and will be a loyal companion for anyone who shows me they love me. I don't know any commands or tricks yet but my mom says I'm really smart and will learn quickly. So if you have a little empty spot in your heart and think I'm just the right piece to fill it then contact Mending Spirits and tell them Billie sent ya!!!",

She loves to go for walks or just run around the yard or inside and play fetch. Layla is great with children and other dogs.  She has not been around any other animal. She is a cuddler. She needs to be in a home with someone who is home with her often. She has separation anxiety and she takes medication for this 2xs a day if she is going to be left unattended. She does great when someone is home which is really why we want her to go to a home with someone who is home most of the time.  She does not really like to be crated but it is probably best she is if someone isn't home with her.  She wants to be someone's constant companion.  Adoption fee 350.

We are currently working on house training and crate training. She is a playful girl who is looking for a family of her own and a home full of toys. \n\nOur adoption fee includes the spay/neuter, up to date vaccines, microchip, Interstate Health Certificate, and the transport service to get the new family pet to you. \n\n Note: All dogs are located in foster homes in ALABAMA and will be transported NORTH AFTER ADOPTION. This means there is no way for a meet and greet before adoption. We try our best to give you honest personalities of the pup for you. We are more than happy to send videos, pictures, and even video chat so that you may have the connection with your pup before adoption. Please know that we can only guess breed and age of our rescues.\n\n All pets are delivered by a licensed transporter. \nThe transportation company that we use is PETSLLC. They are well known and very professional. The link is listed, you are more than welcome to look and see what the closest drop off location is for you. \n\nhttp://www.petsllc.net/stops.php?route=9\n\n COMPLETED APPLICATIONS TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER INQUIRIES! If you are interested in adopting, the FIRST step is to complete an application!\n\n Please copy and paste the following URL for our adoption application:\n\n https://fs29.formsite.com/pickenscountypartnersforpets/form1/index.html\n\n Please be advised that our volunteers are busy rescuing, transporting, and caring for our animals. We will respond to your application as soon as possible. Upon review of your application, the rescue in Alabama will contact you, so you can ask any specific questions that you may have. \n\n If there is more than one decision maker in the home, all of them should be in agreement.\n\n We do not adopt to anyone under the age of 21.",

            "description": "Meet Legolas\n\nBig dog fans we have a beauty for you!!  Legolas is a 91lb, one and a half year old pup.  \nFoster says he loves to play with toys , the kids in the house and chew everything.  He loves to run; chase balls and loves men especially!  He goes crazy for them, its wild.  He will approach any male on the street, he will go up to them and jump on the for kisses and wants to be petted endlessly.   He will run towards the husband with kisses and affections but with doesn't act like that around the wife.   So she thinks he prefers males to females\n\nHe likes to spend a lot of time outside.   His current foster says he may do best with a family that has a backyard, which they don't have.  He loves long walks every few hours.  She was taking him out every few hours for 1.5 to 2 hours.  If it is less than that, he gets very antsy and pace.  If you have a doggy door even better!  He can come and go as he pleases :)   \n\nWhen walking on a leash he does pull hard so he will need some work with walking.   \n\nHe has lived in a house with 3 children and did fine.\n\nWe don't know how he does with dogs or cats.   We are told when walking he shows interest in other dogs.  Unsure if he wants to play or pounce.\n\nOff transport he was surrounded by other dogs and didn't seem overly interested in any of them.  But he may have been overwhelmed by the new sights, smells, cold weather etc.\n\nHe came to us from one of our shelter partners in Arkansas.   They said he was found by a lady on the side of the road so she stopped to help him and called animal control.  \n\n\nAdoption Process:\n\n- please fill out our adoption application: https://www.dayofthedogs.org/adoption-application\n\n- one of our team members will get back to you. \n\n- our dogs can be seen by appointment only after an approved application has been received.\n\n- Adoption fee helps to cover spay/neuter, initial vaccines, rabies, initial worming, and microchip.\n\n-We cannot place holds on our dogs. Please do not contact us until you are prepared to adopt.\n\nNOTE:  We are very good about updating the pet's profiles once adopted.  So no need to write us to ask \"Is he/she still available?\"  If the post is up, the dog is still available. \n\nAbout Us:\nDay of the Dogs is a 501c3 nonprofit that is dedicated to helping shelters increase live release.  We coordinate 2 - 4 transports per month from TX, OK and AR to NW Indiana/Chicagoland area.  We do direct adoptions ourselves out of Dyer, IN area and partner with 12 other rescues and shelters in both IL and IN that are willing to help southern pets in need.   \nWe rely on donations to help fund our ongoing transports.  Please donate if you can.  Every dollar adds up and we are grateful for any help we can get: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/DayoftheDogs\n",

Apple herself is 2 years old and about 48 pounds full grown. Apple can be shy around new people, but when she gets to know you she is incredibly sweet. She is smart, and picks up new tricks in just a couple of days (as long as you have a treat handy). Apple is housebroken, has learned sit, and has improved on her recall skills. She is still a bit skittish with sudden noises or movements but is comforted by affection from humans. Apple was very skinny when we pulled her from the shelter so shes still working on filling in her frame! She is extremely athletic and would make a great jogging buddy. She can climb and jump very high with those long legs of her. Apple prefers to be around her humans and does howl and cry when she is left. She is working on her crate training and separation anxiety, and would prefer a home where people are more around to love on her! Apple is wonderful with other playful dogs and always loves to hang out with them. We are currently looking for an adopter or foster to adopt home for Apple with another medium to large size dog to play with, and a fenced in yard. She is so snuggly and loving and cant wait to share all her love in a forever home. Apple is up to date on vaccines and spayed! She is able to be adopted or go into a foster to adopt home.",

Shes about 7 months old and 35 pounds...To think she had been let down by humans in the past and still has so much love to give to anyone receptive to it. Hazelnut is SO SNUGGLY. Her foster mom says she is very affectionate and relaxed around people. She is a bit frightened of other dogs on walks but really wants to play and loves exploring outside. Hazelnut has lots of energy and is still working on her puppy mouthiness so would prefer a home with older children, and an active family who will take her on long walks and hikes. She enjoys spending time in her crate and chewing on her toys. Belly rubs are the key to this girls heart and shell take any and all the love she can get from people. She would love a home with a big yard to play in and a family that will continue working on her socialization and training. She would surely make an excellent jogging buddy too, with some leash work.

            "description": "VAIL. Vail is about 64 pounds, 2 years old and looks like a Great Pyrenees or Samoyed mix. He has been a wonderful dog inside the home, and an extra fluffy cuddle buddy. We rescued Vail from a Kentucky shelter where he was bound for euthanasia. The hustle and bustle of the city life hasnt been helping Vail decompress well. While at first he was excitedly greeting other dogs and people on walks, he has been growing more reactive to dogs. \n\nInside, he is an excellent dog who is gentle, very relaxed and loves to just lounge around by his people or on the sofa. We believe he would do really well in a quiet home, preferably with a yard that he can explore, and with no other dogs or cats. A calmer surrounding can definitely help him gain more confidence and work on his leash manners. \n\nWe know that in the right environment, with a savvy foster, or foster to adopt home, Vail will make great strides! If you think youre the right fit, without other animals, and can open your heart and home to help him, please apply at www.rescuecity.nyc or email foster@rescuecity.nyc!",

He loves his crate and sleeps there perfectly through the night, hes great on a leash and hasnt had any accidents in his foster home. For the most part Cullen is pretty laid back. Hes been very sweet with his fosters, and even a little shy since coming from the shelter, but has been opening up. He gets very excited when he meets other dogs on walks that he can play with. He loves other dogs his size and smaller. Sometimes loud noises and bigger dogs can intimidate him (and he just cowers in return). Its been great watching this boy blossom and grow more confident around his fosters, and we cant wait to find his forever home.",

            "description": "Coco came to us as an owner surrender. Reportedly, the owner was unable to care for her as she deserved. He further indicated he had been \"unable to bond with her\". Coco is about 7-10 months old. She is fully vetted, current on shots, spayed, and microchipped. She relates well with other dogs when properly introduced. She is energetic and requires redirection. She knows some simple commands such as sit, stay, come. Is able to walk on a leash without difficulty. When relating to humans she is somewhat impulsive but responds appropriately to redirection. Coco would benefit from an intermediate to experience adopter who can build up on the skills she already has. We are not sure how she relates to cats or very young children as we haven't had the opportunity to evaluate these areas. A fenced-in-yard and home visit are a must. NO exceptions will be made to these requirements. \n\nOur adoption process is somewhat different from other organizations as we dont engage in same-day adoptions. The reason why we dont is to prevent returns, or worse, abandonment.\n\nIt is our mission to be the voice for the voiceless. Each dog, cat, or horse that we adopt out has been promised a second chance for happiness and security. We take this promise very seriously. Each potential adopter is asked to complete a PRE-ADOPTION QUESTIONNAIRE. Following receipt and evaluation of this document we proceed to schedule what we have come to call a meet & greet. \n\nWe travel up to 1.5 hours from our location to bring the pet to your home which allows you to see him/her in a secure environment without external distractions. It also allows us to observe the environment where the dog/cat will live and make sure that it provides all the required security to prevent as much as possible any accident. Given the extraordinary circumstances our country is experiencing we have now also instituted what we call \"virtual home visits\". \n\nUsing technology for \"good\", we visit your household using a free app called Google Duo. You can install it for free on your smartphone and will allow us to have a \"face-to-face\" conversation as well as it will allow us to take a peek at your yard. This allows you to see the dog you are interested in, and us to evaluate your fenced-in-yard.\n\nAfter the meet and greet (in your home, adhering to CDC guidelines, I will wear a mask and we will meet in your yard) and if the interaction between you and our dog appears to be a good fit, and you are still interested in our companion dog or cat, we will proceed to complete the formal ADOPTION CONTRACT (if you are an out of state resident: at this time you proceed to make a deposit toward the adoption fee of $100.00 total adoption fee is $275.00), local residents will proceed to complete the adoption donation at this time, For out of state residents the balance of the adoption fee is paid when the dog is delivered. Residents can cover the cost of the adoption donation in cash or check, out of state /local residents can also use PayPal to make the appropriate payment using our email address ycmad2733@gmail.com. \n\nWe ask all of our potential adopters to read our adoption contract beforehand and welcome as many questions as you may have after reading it. https://onedrive.live.com/edit.aspx?cid=a25c7feb241f9ba4&page=view&resid=A25C7FEB241F9BA4!42229&parId=A25C7FEB241F9BA4!7128&app=Word\n\nFor out of state potential adopters, we always inquire how they plan on getting the dog/cat to their residence. Airline trips transporting dogs from the Tallahassee International airport is non-existent. The nearest airport is in Pensacola which is almost 3 hours from our location. In the past, Tennessee residents come to pick the dog by driving to a mutually agreeable location. Others have requested a transport company to bring the dog to them. A highly reliable company i: http://itsadogsliferescuetransport.org (239) 207.6978\n\nDuring the summer, we complete home visits on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 3 to 4 pm, Wednesdays, from 10-11 am, or 3 to 4 pm. In winter, we complete the visits on the same days with a change in time, Tuesday, Wednesdays, and Thursdays from 2-3 pm, and Wednesdays from 10-11 am. Please let us know which one is more convenient for you.\n\nThanks for your interest in a rescue dog!",

He has a lovable, athletic, and striking presence.  \nHe is both house and crate trained, neutered and heartworm negative.  Although he has not been fully tested with other dogs or kids, he is extremely intelligent  and responds quickly to new commands.  He is barrier/leash reactive to other dogs currently, so we\u2019re allowing him time to decompress.  \nWith consistency and commitment, he would make a great forever friend.  Ares loves an active lifestyle. He would make the perfect adventure buddy! \n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2021 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq\n\n*Any breed labels used by Take Paws Rescue, its employees/volunteers, or on vet records provided cannot be guaranteed.  Breed labels are given based on information obtained during intake and/or best guesses based on appearance and/or temperament of the dogs and Take Paws Rescue gives no assurance to the accuracy of these labels. Labels are necessary for postings to many animal networking sites, such as Pet Finder, and are no way a guarantee. Additionally, exact age and potential size cannot be guaranteed.",

I'm probably going to be a medium to large-size dog, and they tell me I'm a lab mix but my ears have started to stand up straight! So I'm a lab mixed with something that doesn't have floppy ears I guess! When I was very young I was found in the mountains with my siblings and then I went to a really nice foster home with kids. If you have the time and patience for an energetic puppy, I'm your guy. And lucky for you training is included in my $550 adoption fee! I'll be ready to go home this Thursday 2/4, and I'll be popular, so please apply today at www.rescueallthedogs.org/adopt-1",

When the shelter in Texas first took them in, they labeled them at pit mixes, which happens a lot, but as they grow we are thinking less and less that they are pit mixes, but we are not sure. They look more like Lab mixes to us, but the truth of it is these pups are probably mixes of 5 or more breeds, so they are just adorable, happy, sweet, playful little mutts. We are guessing these pups will be about 45-55lbs when full grown. \n\nCocoa is a sweet, adorable pup. He loves to play with his siblings and the teens in his foster home. He is doing well on potty training and seems to be very smart! He gets along with the bigger doggy in his foster home (a Lab) and has really been learning from her, it's super cute. Cocoa loves to romp around, play with toys, run around the yard, and give LOTS of snuggles during down time. He is the perfect little pup. He would do great in a home with another dog but it's not mandatory as he is a confident happy pup and would do great with an active family who doesn't have another dog as well. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting Cocoa or one of his siblings, please fill out our adoption application at brighterdaysdogrescue.com",

And she truly deserves it.\n\nLaurel is a Beagle Corgi mix, which means she is both incredibly smart, friendly to everyone but undyingly loyal to those she loves, and even though she is a grown up, this girl knows how to have fun and be silly. Oh, and I cant forget to mention that she is a low rider model who loves long walks and hikes despite her short stature.\n\nIf you are interested in adding Laurel to your family, please fill out our adoption application at brighterdaysdogrescue.com",

            "description": "Marshmallow is a 9 week old adorable little Mutt. When the shelter in Texas first took them in, they labeled them at pit mixes, which happens a lot, but as they grow we are thinking less and less that they are pit mixes, but we are not sure. They look more like Lab mixes to us, but the truth of it is these pups are probably mixes of 5 or more breeds, so they are just adorable, happy, sweet, playful little mutts. We are guessing these pups will be about 45-55lbs when full grown. \n\nMarshmallow is a sweet, adorable pup. She loves to play with her siblings and the teens in her foster home. She is doing well on potty training and seems to be very smart! She gets along with the bigger doggy in her foster home (a Lab) and has really been learning from her, it's super cute. Marshmallow loves to romp around, play with toys, run around the yard, and give LOTS of snuggles during down time. She is the perfect little girl. She would do great in a home with another dog but it's not mandatory as she is a confident happy pup and would do great with an active family who doesn't have another dog as well. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting Marshmallow or one of her siblings, please fill out our adoption application at brighterdaysdogrescue.com",

He is great with other dogs and will wag his tail when meeting them. He loves to run and play in the yard with them. He is amazing with kids and doesn't bother cats either. He has a low to medium energy level - he loves to play in the yard and go for walks, but if calmer indoors. He is shy when meeting new people but warms up quickly. He is decent on leash, house trained, good in the car, and crate trained. JULIAN IS AWESOME! He is easy and will make a family very happy! He likes to play but knows when to be submissive and is not rough. He loves toys, and would love to chase balls or be chased. He listens when you make an uh-uh sound or say no. He is SUCH a cool dog! If you would like to meet him, fill out an application at bcaaofnj.org",

She is so goofy and funny, we just adore her and her shenanigans. Our favorite quirk of hers is her silly army crawl when she wants belly rubs - its adorable. She is crate trained, house trained and learning many new behaviors with her foster family. Since Tess is a little shy at first, she needs a patient and loving hand to slowly acclimate her to life outside the shelter. She would really benefit from puppy classes with her new humans; she is very smart, and loves to learn new things. She will insist on being the only furry friend in the home, and she will need a home with a fenced in yard. Tess is going through heartworm treatments, so a quiet laid back home will definitely help her heal well. Tess is spayed, vaccinated in microchipped. We are currently treating her for heartworms and her adopter would need to bring her for her final treatments in February and keep her activity low until her treatment is completed. Her adoption fee is $250 and you can apply for her on our website at: https://rescueofhope.com/adoption-application/",

We gave her this name to help her self-confidence. She is a retired breeder mama. Adira is 2 year old English BullGirl given up to a vets office who turned her over to our rescue. Her spirit has been hurt by her previous people, but her playful loving personality still pops out occasionally. She will play with her toys and then looks around to make sure she is allowed to have fun. She will run in the fenced yard galloping like a horse then suddenly stops to hide as if she thinks she shouldnt act happy! More and more she is opening to human love and her personality is starting to shine. She is absolutely loving and becoming more confident. She is puppy playful and has some puppy behavior she is working on. Adira weighs almost 50 lbs. She is very shy and timid so an adult home would be better suited for her needs. She needs a home where they will show her it's ok to trust and be loved. Loud noises scare her so soft-spoken people would be best. Adira does seem to like women better than men, only cowering to men she does not react, just tries to make herself as small as possible, covering her eyes. She will need some guidance, love, and patience in order for her to come out of her shell.\n\nShe needs a home with people who have experience with English bulldogs, understand all their breed characteristics and health concerns. She is healthy now but may have allergies or breathing issues in the future. We just want people to be prepared long term. She is good with smaller dogs and some taller dogs but she really prefers to be the only dog to ensure her feelings of safety. She does guard her food from other dogs so feeding separately would be necessary if you have another dog.\n\nThis dog's adoption fee is $900 to go towards their vetting (vaccines, spay/neuter, heartworm/Ehrlichia/Lyme test, fecal test, pre-op blood work, dental cleaning, and microchip as well as grooming if needed). If you are interested please fill out the adoption application For additional information regarding our adoption process, please check our FAQ's Page. \n\n *All dogs in the care of Get a Life Pet Rescue live in loving foster homes while waiting for their perfect match. They don't live in cages or crates (unless there is a medical reason to do so.) They are treated as family pets while in our care. * All dogs in our care are fed premium brand holistic food as well as supplements and vitamins specific to each dog's needs. We don't buy inexpensive bulk dry kibble, our rescues are fed premium wet food diets as part of a comprehensive rehabilitation program to ensure maximum health.*All of our rescues receive complete quality vetting including full dental cleaning with pre-op bloodwork, spay/neuter, vaccines, and grooming. Dogs in need of specialized medicine will be seen by specialists, such as full cardiac workups, ophthalmologist visits, all suspicious lumps, and bumps are biopsied, and every medical need is transparent to potential adopters. *Once you adopt from Get a Life Pet Rescue, you become part of our compassionate family and we are here for you if a problem with your precious dog arises.",

I was surrendered to a shelter in Texas when my owners moved and did not take me along. All I want is to be loved forever. No more disappointments. No more heartache. I will snuggle into your arms and just enjoy your company. I love endless belly rubs and giving soft kisses. I will follow you around and be your best companion. \n\nI LOVE playing with my tennis ball! I entertain myself but I also enjoy playing fetch. I would love a yard to run in and explore! I am getting used to walking on a leash as I forget a human is at the other end and tend to pull.\n\nI am a bit scared of larger or more domineering dogs. So a calmer canine brother or sister is more my speed with which to be around. Little kids tend to make me a bit uncomfortable as I have to get used to sudden, unpredictable movements. I have not been exposed to cats so I am not sure about them.\n\nI am completely housebroken and will respect your belongings. I can be crated but really prefer free reign of the home...after all it is ours, right \n\nMy foster mom says one of her favorite things about me is how I look at her with such loving eyes.\n\nIf I sound like your perfect fur-ever Valentine please apply at https://www.nickelcitycaninerescue.org/adopt-a-dog or message the rescue if you are already pre-approved.",

The wonderful volunteers sent out a plea for help to get this sweet old man out of the shelter and into a nice soft bed! Its pretty clear he LOVES his new bed, In fact he loves it so much his foster mom is going to send it with him to his adoptive home!\nIf she didnt have so many stairs she would adopt him -that is the one requirement for him -he cant go up and downs stairs well so needs a home with no or minimal stairs. \nTodd is such a good boy. He loves to be with the adults or other dogs in the home. He spends most of the day sleeping. He is housebroken and walks well on leash. He sleeps through the night. He is happy to snuggle on the couch or lay at your feet. He is very quiet. He loves taking his meds with cheese. He really is a great companion. He is an angel. \nTodd is best guess 10-11 years old, a 25lb mixed breed. Other than arthritis he is very healthy!",

Shes not too old however to make an amazing companion for a nice quiet home where she can live out her senior years. She would love a dog companion, few stairs, and a nice orthopedic dog bed. She is oh so sweet, timid, and full of love. Her babies are currently being bottle fed. \nYou can learn more about her rescue here:\n\nhttps://www.nbc4i.com/video/stop-the-suffering-interview/6243719/\n\nHolly is best guess a 10-11 year old, 55lb senior German Shorthaired Pointer mix. She may have applications in progress but is currently available. We will have more information once he or she settles in and we get to know her better. \n\nAdoption fee is $195 and includes spay/neuter, microchip, fecal/deworming, vaccines and prevention up to date. Ohio residents only.\n\nSTS is a foster-based and volunteer-run rescue. We do not have a physical location or set hours for you to meet dogs, and it does take time to answer each inquiry. All dogs are in foster homes and once an application is approved and a home visit is completed you will be able to schedule meet and greets with available dogs. We encourage interested individuals to get approved prior to searching as it helps expedite the process. A Petfinder inquiry is not a substitute for an application. For detailed information about our adoption process, including fees, please visit our website at http://www.stopthesuffering.org.",

            "description": "Onyx is a 4yr old, 19lb Schipperke Corgi blend male. This pup has beauty and brains. His foster momma raves about how quickly he learns, and she says hes doing great learning basic commands. He needs an adopter who will spend the time continuing to train him so he can keep working on his doggy manners. Onyx is a fast, high energy dog and needs a safe environment to get his energy out. His new home MUST have a securely fenced yard as he should be treated as a flight risk. He walks well on a leash and likes to go for very long walks. He loves to play and can be a little rough. Absolutely no kids, dogs, or cats in the home. He has shown food and toy aggression when his foster mom has tried to take something away from his mouth. She believes training will help this. \n\nOnyx is still learning to trust his life in a loving home. He would prefer if his adopter is home more often than not since he does have some anxiety. Onyx does great with housetraining when kept on a schedule. \n\nCan you give this gorgeous guy the right forever home? If you are interested in adopting Onyx, please fill out the adoption application at www.PoodleandPoochRescue.org and well see if its a match. Onyx is up to date on vaccines, neutered, heart worm negative, and microchipped. His adoption donation is $350.",

These girls were being given away and we were able to save them thanks to a great supporter who contacted us. Their mom is for sure Husky, but dad we are still contemplating.\n\nThese girls are super sweet. They love to play, are very cuddly, love to lay on the couch and in their dog bed, and even have started howling as Husky\u2019s do. They are great with kids, other dogs, and have been socialized very well.\n\nJeanette is the perfect combo of Momma and Dad. She has the Husky fluffy coat but then has some spots like Brittany.\n\nShe is very independent. She loves to play, pounce around, and is active. She can sometimes be hardheaded but she is overall, a sweet girl. \n\nWe are looking for a home that has husky/large breed experience and has a large fenced in yard. If you are interested in one of these girls, and have any questions, you can contact their foster mom Allison at 225-938-6714 or just go straight to filling out an application at our website at www.danteshope.com",

Franklin is blind, he was found wandering around and bumping into cars and anything that was in his path. Franklin is 17lbs and would love to find a home to retire in, he would do best in a quiet home since he is blind and everything startles him. He needs a family that will be patient with him and help him to start navigating his new life. Once he is comfortable he loves cuddling. He could go to a home with another dog but they will need to be introduced VERY slowly. \n\nFranklin's adoption fee is $150. Due to Franklin's age he will be part of our Forever Foster program, this means that we will cover his medical for the rest of his life. \n\nIf you are interested please submit an adoption at crossyourpaws.com.\n\nIf you have an application on file- please message us on Facebook -do not email! \n\nWe are a 100% volunteer 501c3 and rely solely on donations of our supporters and volunteers. \n\n#cyprescue #kennyrosssubaru #subarulovespets",
