            "description": "Dakota is a male, neutered, Black and Tan 7 year old purebred German shepherd who is papered. He is very sweet, loves people, calm, likes naps, walks and playing. Dakota is not used to strange dogs, gets along best with female dogs, not sure about cats. He is good with children who are over 5 years old. His owner has had him since he was a puppy, unfortunately due to some recent life events she can no longer keep him. Dakota needs a good home as soon as possible because of circumstances unrelated to anything about him.  For more information please call Meghan at home 530 474-1729 (no early morning or late evening calls please). \n\n* note - if you call and get no answer and no voicemail, it means our power is out due to high fire danger or winter storms. Please try again - our power is normally restored within 1-2 days.",

Zeus was owner surrendered to Pet Rescue by Judy as his owner is having a baby and their home was too small for both Zeus and the baby. We were informed that Zeus is housetrained, ok with other dogs, and enjoys walks. When you first meet him, he is cautious and is going to require time and patience in getting him to trust you. Once he does trust you, he is worth the wait. We think he will be a velcro dog who will love to lay on the couch. He will need a quiet home with little or no traffic as making new friends is not fun for him. Zeus loves to play fetch and give lots of hugs and kisses once he feels comfortable with you. If you feel you are the one for Zeus, please fill out an application for him!",

His old family had to give him up when his dad got in trouble and his mom had to move away. Now his whole world has changed and he's a frightened guy.\n\nLuca did live with dogs and little kids and did really well.  However, due to all the changes in his life, we think he needs a patient adopter that can focus on his needs. He would love someone to teach him to be part of a happy home again. He's playful and sweet and loves to deliver kisses. He would love someone to play tug and then cuddle on the couch with. \n\nIf interested in meeting Luca, please fill out an application at www.safewithusanimalrescue.org",

She knows: sit, down and takes treats very gently and does a little dance with her front paws while waiting for her treat. She will gently stand up for a hug and enjoys gentle rubs. Billie is approximately 35 pounds and just the sweetest thing. Her Doggy Date stated: Billie is an active girl, good on her leash, knows sit, likes to play and likes to be loved on.

Here at the shelter, Princess has been affectionate and loves to go on long walks. We believe she is ready to find a new home. Princess's adoption fee is $130. She is spayed and microchipped and has age-appropriate vaccinations. A licensing/microchip fee may apply. To meet Princess or to be added to her waitlist, call (505) 983-4309 x 1610 and leave a voicemail message that includes the DOG'S NAME, plus YOUR NAME and A GOOD PHONE NUMBER - OR e-mail this information to adoption@sfhumanesociety.org. A scheduler will call you back within 48 hours to confirm your request. If you have other dogs at home, tell the scheduler you would like to bring them along for a Meet n' Greet. SFAS offers a variety of excellent training classes, seminars and Trainer Talks led by animal behavior professionals. These are $50 off for animals adopted from any shelter or rescue group! Due to current COVID-19 restrictions, classes and talks are all presented virtually using Zoom. For course descriptions, schedules and registration, visit https://sfhumanesociety.org/our-programs/behavior-training/group-training-classes/ for classes and https://sfhumanesociety.org/our-programs/behavior-training/special-seminars-and-workshops/ for seminars and Trainer Talks.",

            "description": "Make sure you get Flash to flash you his best smile when you meet him! This is one handsome guy! He is a bit shy when meeting someone for the first time, but he quickly warms up and becomes a friendly dog. Flash is house-trained and he walks well on leash. He also knows his command/cue of sit and can catch a treat tossed to him as quick as a flash. He enjoys playing with toys. Flash would probably do best in a dog-savvy adult-only household. He is young, energetic, and he can also get over excited at times where he needs more self-contol. A patient and seasoned dog owner would know how to take things slowly. Flash is in good health, walks well on loose leash, and has been described by staff as a sweet, sweet dog. Flash is hoping to find his new fur-ever home . . . is yours the right one for him?

She is a very sweet girl. She gets along with everyone, including other dogs. She is easygoing. She's not been tested with kids but she would likely do fine with them.\n\nBefore you apply to adopt her, please note that there is a surge right now in adoption costs. We are asking a $950 adoption fee. Here is the breakdown:\n\nEach dog's flight fee is $600, and we also have to pay for the human volunteer's flight (roughly $1800 per trip). During non-covid times, we are able to find volunteers that are already flying to Canada from Turkey, and they bring the dogs home with them on their flight. But because there is a lack of flyers right now, we have to actually fly people to Turkey and back.\nPlease DO NOT email to ask if this dog is available. If they are still on here, they're available.\n\nTO APPLY TO ADOPT, PLEASE GO HERE:\n\nhttps://homeboundhoundz.com/application-form\n\n*Get a MAJOR pet photography session discount if you're coming from petfinder.\nJust email to let me know you found the site on petfinder and you will get a 50% discount for a pet (or family lifestyle) photoshoot.*\n\nwww.emmaspringphoto.com",

Toby's owner has had a rough year; he moved into an apartment that does not allow dogs.  We are looking for a permanent home for this loving boy.  Toby is about three years old and weighs 39.8 pounds give or take an ounce.  His birthdate is November 16, 2017.\n\nHis ideal day would include a routine that includes daily walks, patience, lots of love, and he will be forever grateful to a human who spends time with him.\n\nToby is a big fan of walking on the leash.\n\nHe can live with children who can easily direct his easy going but jovial nature in whatever direction they want him to follow. He is a handsome boy who will really appreciate a family big or small that provides that needed routine, shared exercise and training, and lots of hugs.\n\nIn the middle of the evening when the home is quiet, dogs have been walked, fed, and finished their business outside, he wants to join his humans and the other dogs on the sofa for quiet family time.\n\nAlthough not without accidents, he tries his best to remember where to pee and poo. \n\nApplication is online at karmicrescue.org\n\n(!@#$%^&*()_!@#$%^&*()_!@#$%^&*()_!@#$%^&*()_!@#$%^&*()_!@#$%^&*\n\nWhat breed is my dog? Please remember we do not complete DNA tests on our rescued pups. If we do not know who the mom or dad is for sure, we guess; we use Bing Visual Search. And, we look at their paws, ears, snout, coloring, and body build. So often, we are not spot on. Mutts are usually more healthy than not. And, remember too that even if you know the supposed dominant breed in your new puppy or adult dog, it does not mean that those particular genes will dominate your dog's personality.",

Our co-founder Karen had been watching his profile for days, if not weeks, and worked tirelessly to find him a foster family so that we could rescue him. Thanks to the generosity from the shelter we were able to buy Django a few extra days and keep him off the euthanasia list. Then a Christmas miracle occurred, and we had an amazing volunteer step up and offer to foster Django! Django is alive today thanks to a foster family who opened their home during the holidays. Without them Django would have faced euthanasia at the shelter. \nNow this boy is free and ready to find his forever home! Django is approximately 4-6 years old and weighs 63 lbs. His personality has really flourished since being out of the shelter environment and is showing his true loving and goofy personality. Django loves people and kids! This boy is the epitome of sweet and loving. He also loves a good cuddle session and is more of a couch potato than an outdoor enthusiast. Actually, you won\u2019t catch him outside for very long at all unless it\u2019s for a walk in the sunshine. He is well mannered in his foster home and has proven to be house trained and crate trained. He is just a few days out of the shelter so we have not introduced him to other dogs yet, but will update as soon as we know how he interacts with other pets!\nTo adopt Django fill out our adoption application online at \nwww.bullluvablepaws.org/adopt",

He is potty trained, great on a leash, loves to be on your lap and likes to sleep in bed with you.\n\nPrior to adoption he will be up to date on his vaccines, microchipped and is already neutered.

            "description": "Dakota is a 6 year old, spayed female Black Mouth Cur (~60 pounds), microchipped, up to date on her shots, and very healthy. She's been with us since 2015. She's very affectionate with humans, but she would do best as the only dog in the home. She might be OK with compatible larger dogs (meeting suggested- she's OK with our 21 month German Shepard), but she has issues with our small dogs, which is why we made the difficult decision to rehome her. No cats- we don't have them, but she wants to chase them on sight. She's an energetic dog, and loves to run along with a bike, go on hikes or wander with you sniffing out the area (she'll handle the sniffing!). She does well on a leash, and rides well in the car. Even at 60 pounds, she's something of a lap dog, and will snuggle up under your chin. If that's not for you, she knows \"off!\" and will be happy with lots of head and chest scritches and belly rubs. She knows sit, down, stay (to a point), wait, roll over, high 5, crate, place, is fully housebroken, and is used to using a dog door, but will also scratch to be let out. She's food-driven, and easy to train with the offer of treats. She does well in a crate, for sleeping or for breaks during the day. Apart from grabbing the occasional sock, or food left unattended, she's very good around the house, and before the pandemic, we were able to leave her on her own with dog door access to the yard.  Please contact us to arrange a meeting- we're sure you'll love her.\nPlease Contact : Bob Musser\n(916)213-4178",

If you think I am pretty, wait until you meet me, you will wonder how you managed to get along all your life without me :) I have lived in a home my entire life until I was surrendered to rescue. That was a glorious day because now I know I will one day soon go to live with an amazing family who will make me their everything. When I was in boarding I had lots of other dog friends and loved each of them\u2014especially the ones who loved to play. My foster mama took me into the house where I got to meet the kitties who rubbed all over me\u2014they are almost as special as me. People\u2014boy do I LOVE people! I must warn you - I take my job seriously and like all good Pyrs have learned to bark to ward off bad things\u2014like a flock of birds flying overhead. I have heard it said that I am smart\u2014when I see a treat I know to sit and don\u2019t even wait for the command! My foster mama says I walk around wagging my tail saying \u201cI am so cute, aren\u2019t I cute, look at me\u201d. What can I say, I love to be the center of attention! I have a way of drawing you in to me! My PYRfect home would have either another resident dog or a dog who comes over to play a lot, a big yard with a locking gate, children (I lived with a small child), and a person(s) who will continue to teach me the wonders of life!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nView full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.\n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

He does see shapes and shadows, but he gets frightened easily and can be mouthy. For this reason, he needs a quiet home with no children or other dogs. Levi weighs 44 lbs., he's 7 yrs. old (est. birth date is 7/31/2013) and his adoption fee is $175. If you want more information about Levi, please submit a survey at https://furkids.org/dog-adoptions/application. At this time, meeting our dogs is by appointment only. After submitting a survey, an adoption counselor will contact you to give you more information about the dog you are interested in adopting and to arrange for you to meet the dog. Must be at least 21 years of age to adopt.",

            "description": "This is Moonshine! He was born approximately February 2020, is a pit mix and is such a happy boy despite his sad past. He was found by a rural shelter with over 130 BB pellet wounds all over his body after being shot with a shotgun by a terrible human. He was so timid at first around humans but turns corners so quickly. Now he is in a foster home, his wounds are healing, and he is getting more confident by the day! He warms up rather fast and is doing amazing. This gentle boy loves other dogs and is great around children. He loves to give kisses and is the best cuddle buddy! He loves to chew, and is learning quickly to only chew on toys (and learning fast!). He is fixed, potty trained, and microchipped. But most of all, this sweet boy just wants to be loved, and has so much love to give in return!\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2020 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq",

Thank you for considering a rescue! The adoption fee includes vaccinations, Bordetella, de-worming, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip. There is a an additional $12.99 fee for Home Again for a lifetime registration of the microchip.\nPuppies cannot be adopted outside of the Houston area until they are spay/neutered after they are 4 months old. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.\nNOTE: In our bios, we provide information based on our volunteer's experience with a particular dog; such as temperament, training, and ability to get along with others.\nAARF is a 501(c)3 Non Profit, all breed, no kill organization. Our group is always in need of donations in order to continue to give the needed medical care to our rescues. Adoption fees do not begin to cover all of the medical costs. Any donation , no matter how small is a big help and is greatly appreciated. Please help us to continue to help them. Thank you.",

            "description": "Princeton (Prince) is a sweet and energetic Doberman Pinscher guy--nearly 5 years old. He is affectionate, a little needy and playful. He likes to cuddle with his humans...he thinks he's a lap dog. \nHe's a large (90 lbs.) strong dog so leash walking needs to be done with a no pull harness (leash attachment at the chest). He can be crated for short periods of time, but has been good when left alone loose in the house.\nAs is true for most of his breed, Prince is a great watch dog.  He has led a somewhat sheltered life, so needs someone who can help socialize him to be less distrusting of new people and dogs.  We think he is not the dog to share a home with a cat and he has no real experience with young children, so he will do best in a home with respectful children 8 or older or an all adult home.  He also will do best as the only dog in the home.  \nPrince definitely needs a home with a fenced yard (not electric/invisible fence) and needs a person or family that doesn't need to regularly leave him alone long hours. \n(A $400 adoption fee is required.) \nIf you are interested in this dog, please go to the Adopt page of our website where you will find a link to an adoption application form  https://www.chewdogrescue.org/index.php/component/rsform/form/5-adoption-application-form\n \nIf you have previously submitted an application form, there is no need to re-apply. Just let us know you're interested in this dog. We do our best to match families and dogs so everyone is pleased and the placement is permanent. We reserve the right to refuse an applicant if the home situation is incompatible with the needs of the rescue dog. Rescue is about doing our best for the dog. We do home and reference checks.  All of our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and are up to date with current vaccinations, before being placed in their forever homes.\n\nFOSTER HOMES NEEDED! We are always looking for good foster homes. Our rescue is foster based and we can always save more dogs if we have foster homes for them to go into. It is not a long term commitment. We have been able to find good forever homes in a short time. We also welcome volunteers who can help transport dogs and help with our outreach and fund raising efforts. Please contact us if you can help.",

Experience with Bully Breeds preferred*\n\nDwayne \"The Dog\" Johnson is just that- the MAN! This big beefy hunk of dog is 6 years young, 60 pounds, and is the single most beautiful dilute tri color coat we have EVER seen! He will turn heads wherever he goes- and he can't wait to go home to you! He is a VERY active boy who has been through the ringer of a \"ruff\" life and is now looking for a bully experienced home to take him home and love him! Unfortunately Dwayne will not be suitable in a home with small animals or children, but could live in a home with another dog (thought this prince and be picky!) He is a BIG strong dog that needs an attentive owner willing to keep up with his training. If you're interested in adopting any of our animals please fill out an application on our website www.lastchanceranch.org His adoption fee is $295 and that includes he is neutered, microchipped, and up to date with all vaccines as well as current with flea/tick treatments and heartworm testing.

            "description": "I'm a Husky!Everest was born around December 31, 2017 and weighs about 45 pounds. Everest's story is an unfortunate one. It starts when he was purchased as a puppy from a breeder. When Everest was 13 weeks old he was taken to the vet for an eye injury. The vet paperwork says 'child and puppy were playing and puppy cut his eye' the vet and owner concluded that Everest was 'unruly due to three boys under the age of 6 years'. Fast forward a few years and Everest is now being kept in the basement because no one in the home has time for him. Everest is constantly escaping (can you blame him?) and getting taken in by the local dog control. The owners realize this is not the best situation for Everest so they decide to try and sell him for $100. One of the owner's friends hears about this and convinces the owner to surrender the dog so he is not put into another bad situation and potentially used for breeding. We are thankful to have Everest with us and he is now neutered and ready to go to his forever home. We will be looking for a very specific home for Everest so he never has to be thrown away again. Husky experience is a must as well as a secure, physical fenced-in yard. We also want Everest to have another playful, sturdy, decent sized dog in his next home to run and play with. Lastly, we will be looking for a home with no kids or older teenage kids only and adults that understand Everest had an unfortunate start to his life and will need some time and understanding. We promised Everest we won't let him down and we know there is a home somewhere that is going to be perfect for him. Traditionally Huskies are not good with cats and Everest follows this tradition. The Adoption Fee for this dog is $300.00.\nAdoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a 'complete' pet. We accept CASH or Visa/Mastercard ONLY.\n\nJoyful Rescues has no funding except for our adoption fees and miscellaneous donations. Pet care and vet bills are expensive - you must be ready to take on this financial (as well as emotional) responsibility. YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 25 YEARS OF AGE TO ADOPT A DOG FROM JOYFUL RESCUES\n\nWe keep our pet list as up-to-date as possible. As soon as a pet is adopted, it is removed from the list. If a pet is still showing, it is still available for adoption.\n\nCan't Adopt Me? SPONSOR ME\nLook for the Link 'Special Instructions to Seller' if you want to note a particular pet\nBefore you seek to adopt a pet from Joyful Rescues, please read our Pet Adoption page http://www.joyfulrescues.org/pet_adoption.html.\n\nOnline Application",

If you have room in your heart and home to give a hound a second chance, please fill out an ONLINE FOSTER HOME APPLICATION at our website.\n\nSikorsky is a gorgeous 5 year old Bluetick boy that needs a foster home while he waits for his forever home. Weighing in at 75 lbs, he loves nothing more than being with his people and getting some loving. His tail never stops wagging and he is a sweet, gentle boy that is joyfully exuberant about food and toys. He got along with both the small and large dog in his foster home and loves everyone he meets. He is cratetrained and housetrained, but has not been left alone loose in the house due to his desire to make his own fun with things he shouldn't. He is not an especially vocal dog, but has a deep, raspy bay. He needs continued work with his basic manners (leash walking/sit/down/stay). Due to his size and some exuberance about food, he is best with older children.\n",

I make really loud chitters when I'm getting scritches, it's clear that they're my favorite. I have a long, waggy tail that is slightly out of control when I'm happy, which is nearly always! I am slowly learning what toys are, but I am a collector of blankets and beds. I will occasionally steal the empty food bowl to show you how hungry I am. I do not like my kennel at all, so I would do well in a home that doesn't need me to kennel. I am a very big boy, and also very excited, so I will need to practice staying down when I meet new people.\n\nTo see other hounds currently in our care please visit the Hounds in Our Care page on our website.\n\nYou can also learn learn more about our adoption philosophy and find a link to our online application at our website: www.gpa-mn.org\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about adopting from GPA MN, please contact us at adoptioninfo@gpa-mn.org",

I like being around people and getting lots of attention, but I'll also sneak off and steal stuffed animals that are not mine - the bigger the better! I'm very food motivated and already starting to learn some tricks. I love walking around the neighborhood and seeing what's happening! I do get into trouble if I have too much energy, so those walks also help me chill - there are definitely some Vesta teethmarks on unapproved items in my foster home! I would rather not be kenneled if I know my people are home, because I just want to be around them all the time if I can! I also do have some opinions about snowplows and people coming to the door, and I let you know what I think by barking. I love the kids that I get to be around, and I am very patient with them, but I would not do well with a feline housemate!\n\nTo see other hounds currently in our care please visit the Hounds in Our Care page on our website.\n\nYou can also learn learn more about our adoption philosophy and find a link to our online application at our website: www.gpa-mn.org\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about adopting from GPA MN, please contact us at adoptioninfo@gpa-mn.org",

I don't like loud noises - my foster family was watching a loud TV show and I did not like it, nor did I like their game of ping pong! I started out a little anxious with my new life but I'm settling in. I think I'd like a relaxed household. I do need someone to keep an eye on me while I learn what appropriate toys are - I've already tried to steal the tv remote and some socks!\n\nTo see other hounds currently in our care please visit the Hounds in Our Care page on our website.\n\nYou can also learn learn more about our adoption philosophy and find a link to our online application at our website: www.gpa-mn.org\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about adopting from GPA MN, please contact us at adoptioninfo@gpa-mn.org",

Initially, she wanted to drive up front with me but after about 10 minutes of excitement, she rode well in the backseat. We visited two parks and the river- she didn't react to any of the nearby dogs, ducks, or people. She enjoyed walking by the riverbed. She had some fries and chicken nuggets afterward. She automatically sits for those chicken nuggets.",

I'm very curious and have a strong sense of smell that I think will lead me to all kinds of adventures. I love treats and would love to be given a wide variety of snacks. I can get excited easily and will wiggle my whole body to show you how happy I am. When I'm too excited I do a funny run with a goofy grin on my face. I recently had a growth removed from my paw so I will currently need to have follow up vet visits until my paw is fully healed. I'm looking for a family who can be patient with me while I settle in, and then make sure I get enough love and exercise to keep me happy. Think you have the right home for me? Come meet me at Woodford Humane or call 859-873-5491 to find out more about me! \n Primary Color: Black Secondary Color: White Weight: 41.25lbs Age: 5yrs 1mths 0wks Animal has been Neutered",

Mr. Beans has been taught to sit, shake and laydown - he is eager to please, who knows how many tricks Mr. Beans could learn ?! \nMr. Beans is an energetic 10 month old pup, he weighs 54 pounds.  He will need an active home and a family willing to spend time working with him to help him become the best doggie he can be.\nMr. Beans was not socialized with other dogs prior to coming to the shelter in search of his forever home.  Therefore, at this time he has not learned how other dogs would like to be treated (Mr. Beans is too enthusiastic).  To help with his socialization and to reinforce good manners, he will need to be enrolled in puppy obedience classes as part of the adoption process.   \nMr. Beans is friendly and loving, but at this time, he will need to be the only dog in his forever home but he can have doggie friends (similar to his size) outside of the home. Mr. Beans will need a cat free home.  Due to Mr. Beans energy level and manners, we commend any children in his forever home are teenagers.",

I am very scared here, but warm up quickly. I will tinkle a little bit when I am scared. I do walk on the leash, but very slowly. I do well with other dogs. Actually I would do best going home with another dog. I have more confidence! Meet and greet required. No small children. I am truly a sweet boy and deserve better! Call my adoption coodinator Alexandra 330-261-3934 if you can rescue me. My adoption donation is $125 and includes neuter, UTD vaccines, and microchip.",

I am in a foster home right now. That means I live with these nice people until my forever family finds me and takes me home.\n\nLet me tell you some stuff about myself.  First of all I LOVE people! And I love kids 12 and up! They are great to play with!  I love going out and about.  I would be good in an active family where there is always stuff to do. My foster mom says I would be good for someone that is outdoorsy and will keep me busy. \n\nI am house trained and kennel trained, but I am really good in the house and don't tear things up. My Mom says I have \"home training.\" I like going for walks but if I get really excited I pull on the leash. My foster Mom says I am really smart and if I went to doggy obedience school, she is sure I will graduate and get a diploma. That sounds like so much fun! I could learn some tricks!  I am ok with dogs that are around my size. I do not care for cats.\n\nI am fully vetted, up to date on vaccines, tested for heartworms and internal parasites, on heartworm prevention and spayed and microchipped. All I need is a family that will love me as much as I will love them!\n\nI am in a foster home. I am not at the clinic.\n\nPlease call my foster Mom, Debby at 901-396-5926 or email her at revsofmathew@earthlink.net. Mom will be handling my adoption.",

He loves to lay on the couch and be snuggled on and then go for walks and he is so happy. What a total gem!!\n\nCameron is in a foster home with 3 other dogs and is doing very well with them. He can get posessive over his food and treats if you let him, but with a quick correction he is quick to learn the rules. He would be happy as on only dog but we think he could do well with a female dog who would put him in his place and not let him become dominant. He would also need a strong pack leader to teach him the ropes and be consistent with his training.\n\nHe is super sweet and loves to snuggle. He is crate trained and housebroken except for a little marking, but he wears a male diaper with no issues until we can get him neutered. We think he would do well with children that are a little older, 8 and up, so they will be respectful of him and his neglectful past. We are going to say NO cats for this boy because he loves to chase squirrels and has a prey drive. He love to play but also love to be a couch potato and he loves his walks. He is up for a 1-2 mile hike as well but he does not need this much exercise on a daily basis, he is an old soul in a younger dogs body. He would benefit from an easy walk harness as he pulls a bit on the leash. This boy is super smart and catches on quickly. \n\nCameron is all up to date on his vaccines, has had a full bloodwork panel done, and also has an appointment to be neutered on January 15th. This is all included in his adoption fee. He is just waiting for the right family to scoop him up!! Are you his FUR-ever home??",

            "description": "My name is Stitch and I am an 8 year old, 85 lb, German Shepherd. Don't let my age fool you though because I am a happy outgoing boy who loves his toys and hoomans. I am potty trained, and I walk well on a leash. I do well and love to be around other dogs, but am not a fan of the felines so I need a home without kitty companions. I have met kids 12 and older but no little ones yet. I would love to meet any kids! I will be a gentle big boy. I am a really laid back and easy going guy and am very friendly and loveable. I was abandoned and ended up in a high kill shelter but I don't let my past get me down. I always have my goofy smile on my face. I have the beginnings of hip dysplasia but have no issues with stairs or walks or excercise. I was just diagnosed with renal disease also known as kidney failure so we don't know my lifespan ahead but I am currently having no issues with that either. (Dogs with renal disease can live several years so Stitch could still have his full lifespan ahead of him). I am undergoing heartworm treatment and only have a slight case of heartworms so I will have a full recovery there! Despite my health challenges, I would be a great companion to any current resident dogs and to the hoomans of any family. My leash manners and potty training are a great plus. I know I'm not allowed on the furniture and I have perfect house manners. I ride great in the car and love car rides too! If you think we would be a good match please follow the instructions below to meet me! \n\nStitch is fostered in Lincoln and cannot be viewed at the shelter in Papillion. The adoption fee is $300 and covers age appropriate vaccines, a microchip, and a spay/neuter. The adoption fee helps cover the cost of these vetting procedures. If you want to meet this pet, or are interested in adopting, please submit an inquiry or email to email@townandcountryhumanesociety.org. They will determine if you and/or your family are a fit and if so, provide instructions for completing the application. \n\nAfter you have submitted an application and have been approved, we will setup a meet and greet between you and the pet. Applications are reviewed in order of receipt. \n\nPlease be sure to follow us on Facebook to learn more about Town and Country Humane Society and our mission.",

Many people are losing the opportunity to adopt the animal they want because they fail to put in an application and the pet was adopted before we could answer your email. .If you have applied for an animal in our facility and have not received a response within 7 days, PLEASE call or contact us again. Though we do our best in trying to answer all emails in a timely manner, sometimes things get away from us, get lost or misplaced.

            "description": "Hello foxy, Roxy Rocket. She may have a supervillainess name and a masked face, but make no mistake this gal is a super sweet, super adorable pup.\n\nOne of our Batman pups Roxy is a large, mixed breed - we think primarily pointer with possibly some hound and lab. Like most bottle fed pups, Roxy craves attention and is very people friendly and longs for a family that will love and pamper her forever. She is learning to walk on a leash, and working on commands, \"sit\", \"down\" and \"roll over\". Roxy is a smart, obedient, happy girl who needs a home that can keep her physically and mentally stimulated and in a good supply of chew toys!\n\nThe 9 \"Batman\" pups arrived at Dolly Goodpuppy on April 23rd at only 2 weeks old. Their mom was unhealthy, malnourished, and could not feed or care for her pups. They came in heavily loaded in parasites and some had breathing issues. They were bottle fed for over a week, had multiple dewormings, trips to the vet, and various meds. For several it was very touch-and-go for a while. They are all doing great now - strong, feisty, and full of puppy personality - are looking for their forever families.\n\nApproximate DOB -04/09/2019\n\nAdoption fee includes; spay, microchip, vaccinations, and up to date heartworm/flea/tick prevention.\n\nInterested in Roxy? complete our online foster or adoption application at dollygoodpuppy.org",

I\u2019m on the smaller side at only 45 lbs.\n\nI was in a home at one time, but my owner was no longer able to care for me and left me outside. Unfortunately, because of all the mosquitoes here in the Memphis area, I contracted Heartworm disease. Luckily, I ended up at Grace Animal Hospital, where I was introduced to the kind folks at Streetdog Foundation. I\u2019m currently going through treatment to get rid of the pesky heartworms, but I will be good-to-go in no time. I like other animals and all people (even the tiny ones!), so I will make a great family pet. Please apply to adopt me if you can give me a wonderful home where I will be loved and cherished for the rest of my life!\n\n*Behaviors not listed have yet to be tested.",

She is sweet, goofy, gets excited easily, likes to play in puddles, and loves to cuddle when she feels safe at home. A strong and energetic girl, Zadie has been through a lot of change, so she can get nervous and reactive in new or high energy situations. She has been in a dedicated board and train facility for the past 2 months to work on her behavior, confidence, and fear reactivity. Zadie needs an experienced dog owner who can provide a calm space, regular exercise, consistent training, and lots of love!A full report on her personality, behavior and needs will be made available to Zadie's adopter. She will do best in a calm and structured home environment. Zadie is smart, loveable, and will make a wonderful companion for someone who has the time, experience, and energy to give her all the love and attention she needs!'\n\nShe is house trained, spayed, microchipped, and up-to-date on all vaccinations (records available). Interested adopters can contact me (Carmen Atwater) at 336-346-6035 or carmenatwater@gmail.com.

            "description": "Harley is an adorable 4.5 year old little meat head! She is petite for her breed and has the cutest pointy ears that are too big for her body. Harley was adopted out as a puppy but was recently returned to EHR.\n\nHarley is a very nervous dog. She is good with other dogs (although she would need to live with a more submissive one), and is friendly to strangers although a little nervous. Harley's ideal home would be without children and with adults who understand she is fearful with some situations. She has a bunch of energy so someone who is active is ideal! She loves to play with toys and enjoys a ride in the car.\n\nIf you are interested in Harley, visit EHRDOGS.ORG and fill out an application for HARLEY!!!",

My foster mom found me on the side of a country road in Polk county, and when she pulled her truck over and got out, I jumped right onto her seat and stayed there!  I LOVE car rides\u2014Vroom Vroom!  \n\nMy foster mom says that I\u2019m a very relaxed, chill guy, even when I\u2019m around other dogs who are acting crazy.  I\u2019m very well mannered.  I love to be covered up with a cozy blanket at night and I love to cuddle as well.  In my mind, I\u2019m a lap dog! My favorite playthings are solo cups, bones, treats, tennis balls and big bouncy balls.  I love kids too!  \n\nI would do best in a house that has a fenced in yard, and where my family isn't gone to work all day long.\n\nIf you would like to adopt me (and I sure hope you do!), please reach out to Safe Paws Rescue and they will send you an application to begin the adoption process. Safe Paws is a small rescue, so they accept inquiries from residents in Pinellas County only, please.\n",

With the holidays and COVID causing additional strains on shelter space, they wanted to help give these two boys the best chance at finding their perfect furever homes. \n\nToo often, puppies given as presents over the holidays end up in shelters or on the streets. Thankfully, we had some amazing fosters step up, and we were able to welcome Holliday and Tiny Tim to the Streetdog family! \n\nTiny Tim is a little over 4 months old, heartworm negative, neutered, and up to date on all puppy immunizations! He is as sweet as can be and settling in wonderfully with his foster family!",

She is up for adoption through Paws Fur Life.\nShe's up to date on vaccines, medium energy with stamina, Enjoys warm summer days, zoomies in the yard, laying in a warm blanket, long walks and spending time with her people. No small animals for this gal as she has strong prey drive. I'd say no other dogs at this point- although her socialization skills with boundaries and impulse control are improving daily.\nShe must have a fenced in yard, no exceptions.\nKids over the age of 6 in the home are okay. She really likes people, but is a bit of a powerhouse so she will need someone who is comfortable with being strict when it comes to spacial boundaries, consistent rules, structure and getting her daily exercise.\nShe is crate trained, walks beautifully on leash(with a prong collar and shock collar), rides well in the car and is continuing to improve with her manners around people and animals.\nThis gal could make a structured person or the right couple a very nice companion. Please share so we can find this beautiful gal a great forever home.\nAdoption Fee: $350 to Paws Fur Life\n\nFill out an application for Sky at:\n\nttps://www.cognitoforms.com/PawsFurLife1/PuppyDogAdoptionApplication\n\nSky is not a Rose's Rescue dog.

            "description": "Age: 9 months (as of 12/20/20)\nWeight: 40.6 lbs (as of 11/20/20)\n\nLocation: RI\n\nThis dog has been spayed/neutered, is up to date on shots, on heartworm preventative and is microchipped.\n\nHux wants to be your new best friend!\n\nHe is an absolutely PHENOMENAL dog to have around. Nice house manners and so snuggly. Gets along with others in the family (dog and human), crates nicely, not destructive, settles after alarm barking, not jumpy. This guy burrows into you both physically and emotionally; it is hard not to adore him!\n\nHux has plenty of puppy energy and playfulness, but also settles and can be a couch potato once his daily exercise needs are met. He is very playful with dogs and his best friend is his former family's other dog, Sissy (already adopted through SOS), but he is also living with four senior dogs right now and is not annoying to them! Hux would make a great addition to a household as the only dog or as a buddy to a playful existing family dog(s). He is interested in going new places and meeting new people, but can be hesitant of strangers at first, men moreso than women, and has shown some reactivity when on leash. His former family had two toddlers who he was very gentle with, but Hux would do best in an adult-only household with limited family members, as the additional activity and foot traffic that children and/or roommates bring would likely not be a great fit for Hux, at least not until he builds his confidence and social skills.\n\nHe is house trained and loves going on walks but could use a little work on his leash skills as he tends to pull; he walks much better in an Easy Walk harness. Hux is a pretty quiet boy but he may bark to get your attention or alert you of something he hears/sees. He also shows overexcitement and reactivity on the leash when he sees other dogs and some people. His adopters will need to be committed to working on this in slow, small doses, and he would be best suited for a neighborhood that is not super busy.\n\nA fenced yard would be ideal so he could run and play safely, but if that's not available he'll need lots of leash walks and opportunities for off-leash play in a fenced area. His preferred playstyle is wrestling, boxing and bitey-face, but he is also very socially appropriate with dogs that he has been properly introduced to and reads their body language very well...but he will try all his tricks to try to engage another dog in play.\n\nA basic training course is a must for Hux, to help teach him good manners and commands, further his socialization and confidence with other dogs and people, and help build that very important bond between him and his human(s). Additionally, private training to reduce his leash reactivity will be critical, especially if his adopters plan to leash-walk him in populated areas regularly.\n\nHux is a gentle, happy, SNUGGLY boy who just wants a loving forever home. Can you make his dream come true? Fill out an application today and let him know that you'd love to have him join your family!\n\nHux's Story: Hux and his pal Sissy were surrendered by their owners as they felt they could no longer provide the attention they need with two toddlers and another child on the way.\n\nAdoption Fee: $585\n\nTo apply for this dog, fill out an adoption application on our website: www.sosarl.org/aa/\n\n**Additional info you should know - For most of our dogs, we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each of our dogs as an individual and do our best to describe and place them based on personality not breed label. Some dogs may not yet be in New England, nor ready for immediate adoption. There may be additional vetting, quarantine, waiting periods and/or fees depending upon your state of residence. If you have questions or concerns on any of this, you can discuss this with your Adoption Counselor.",

I've been returned before for being a little too protective but with some training I think I could get better at not sounding too scary!

But aside from all that I'm a big sweetheart, I love to give hugs and be petted! I'm basically a super energetic lap dog. So have I won you over yet?

You see, Tammy had witnessed all the dogs she lived with be killed by a hateful person. She was being fed with only scraps and was having to feed and protect her young puppies. Tammy was rescued and is now with an SPCA foster family who has been working with her for about 7 months now. Tammy never had positive human interactions until now. She is fearful of new people but will come around to liking them! She goes to doggy daycare everyday and just has the TIME of her life playing with all the other dogs. She is house trained and is working on basic house manners. Tammy must be given time to open up. First impressions are not always the best with her. She is very sweet and friendly, actually would make a great companion dog for someone who is willing to give her time! \n\nFor adoption: www.spcaeasttx.com",

            "description": "Charley       8-year-old male black Lab mix      99-lb     Neutered\n \nBackground:  \nFound near the I-5 highway by a San Joaquin County Sheriff in mid-October, this guy was suffering from a badly broken left hind leg.   His femur bone was shattered \u2013 likely a result of being hit by a car.  After extensive surgery and the installation of titanium hardware to hold his femur together, a battle with challenging bacterial infection at the site of the injury began.  We pulled him from a central valley shelter hoping to nurse him through his recovery, but Charley\u2019s life became in jeopardy due to the expanding bacterial infection that his body and antibiotics could not resolve.  He was also putting very little weight on the leg even though the surgery was almost two months ago \u2013 the bone was not healing properly.  Charley (given that name by the shelter) had his leg amputated a few days before Christmas \u2013 talk about a lump of coal \u2013 but at least Charley is alive.\n \nNothing slows down Charley -- https://youtu.be/SBXQ9WBncc4\nCharley bopping around his foster home -- https://youtu.be/DdY6bgKdt20\n \n\nWhat Charley\u2019s foster says:    \nCharley is 100 lbs of sweetness.  This amazing boy has been through so much and still has so much love to give.  He is super friendly with people and other dogs.  He\u2019s currently living with our 6-year-old female Lab and has been around a couple of other family\u2019s pups and is always friendly.  \n\nNot sure about cats, although I know he\u2019s a squirrel chaser.  He spotted one on the fence in our backyard and took off after it.  Because of his post-surgery recovery  he has been spending most of his time inside.  \n\nHe is fully housetrained.  He sleeps mostly on the couch or on a dog bed because it\u2019s unsafe for him to maneuver getting upstairs to our bedrooms, at least for the time being.  Charley has been left alone in the house multiple times with no issues.  The only times I\u2019ve heard him bark are when the doorbell rings and when I\u2019m returning home; he will bark at the door, just excited for me to walk in.  Charley also feeds off the energy of our own dog so he may not even do that if he\u2019s the only pup.  He sometimes startles and gets scared of loud, abrupt noises so he may not be a fan of 4th of July fireworks.   \n\nHe loves his food and treats and will sit, stay, and wait for me to say \u201cok\u201d to eat it.  He definitely knows \u201csit\u201d and \u201cstay\u201d and comes when you call him.  Charley loves to have his ears scratched.  Sometimes he snores as loud as my husband.  He is a cuddler (or a nuzzler as I call him).  He loves to nuzzle in right next to you for pets and sometimes tries to be a 100-lb lap dog.  He has been recovering amazingly from his surgery and has adjusted so well.  I think if dogs could talk he would be saying that he is so thankful that he was saved and that he is ultimately much happier on 3 legs.  Whoever adopts sweet Charley is hitting the jackpot!\n \nWhat Charley\u2019s Rescue Rep says:   \nWhat a wonderful spirit and attitude for so much that he has gone through.  He was not using that injured leg much at all when he first joined our program and is getting around exceptionally well now that the leg is completely gone.  We except him to recover fully from the amputation surgery and live a long and fulfilling life on just three legs.  He is one big dog \u2013 not really that overweight \u2013 do not know sure what he is mixed with.  Charley will need some work on walking on a leash as he pulls quite hard on the leash.  Would do fine in a home with or without another dog.  Might be a bit too exuberant for small children or someone unsteady on their feet. \n \nMedical:  With the exception of lacking one of his back legs, Charley is in great shape.  He is current on Rabies and distemper vax, heartworm negative, neutered,  and microchipped.\n \nCharley is located in:  Napa.\n \nIf you are interested in Charley, please contact Rescue Rep Dave at 415-686-4248 or david.c.ely@sbcglobal.net\n",

If you are approved then we can set up an appointment for you to come meet the animal of your choice. (Appointments can be made 7 days a week between 7am and 5pm) The shelter is still CLOSED to the public so we have to do the meets outside in the parking lot. \n\nWe do not have an adoption fee or an application fee. Animals do have to be sterilized and vaccinated before they leave if they havent been already. Its the law if you adopt from a municiple shelter. The veterinarian you choose will get your money. Not us. \n\nApplications are on our petfinder page (link above). If you decide to send one please attach a photo copy of your ID/DL. We cannot process it until we have that. The process can take anywhere from 2-8 days. \n\nApplications are sent to dbroughton@petersburg-va.org\n\nAlways call the shelter if you need more info or have any other inquiries. If we cannot get to the phone right away please leave a voice message. We are extremely understaffed right now so thank you in advance for your patience! \n\n",

If you are approved then we can set up an appointment for you to come meet the animal of your choice. (Appointments can be made 7 days a week between 7am and 5pm) The shelter is still CLOSED to the public so we have to do the meets outside in the parking lot. \n\nWe do not have an adoption fee or an application fee. Animals do have to be sterilized and vaccinated before they leave if they havent been already. Its the law if you adopt from a municiple shelter. The veterinarian you choose will get your money. Not us. \n\nApplications are on our petfinder page (link above). If you decide to send one please attach a photo copy of your ID/DL. We cannot process it until we have that. The process can take anywhere from 2-8 days. \n\nApplications are sent to dbroughton@petersburg-va.org\n\nAlways call the shelter if you need more info or have any other inquiries. If we cannot get to the phone right away please leave a voice message. We are extremely understaffed right now so thank you in advance for your patience! \n\n",

            "description": "Meet Charlie! He is a 4 year old pitbull mix. He came to us in November 2020 from a shelter partner in Georgia, when they no longer had space for him. He already knows basic commands such as sit, stay, heel and down. He walks pretty well on a leash, making him the perfect walking or running partner! While this energetic boy loves to be outside, he will curl up with you after a long day for some snuggles! He likes some other dogs, but he can be a bit picky about his friends so if you have another dog at home, they'd have to meet first! He gets a little fussy over the cats at the shelter, so we think he'd do best in a home with no cats. If your looking for the perfect hiking/walking dog, or just a lovable companion, Charlie is your dog! \n\nCharlie has lived in a home previously and was in our 'Home for the Holidays' foster program! His foster said he was nervous at first, but was very food motivated making it easier for him to settle in! They said he was very obedient and eager to learn! In his previous home, he lived with children and they were a bit too much for him, so he'd do best in a home with adults only. He has interacted with some of our staff's children and done well, but he gets easily overwhelmed by them. \n\nIf interested in adopting Charlie, please submit an online adoption application! Due to COVID-19, all animal meetings must be scheduled by appointment. Once we receive and review your application, we will contact you to schedule an appointment! Thank you!",

If you are approved then we can set up an appointment for you to come meet the animal of your choice. (Appointments can be made 7 days a week between 7am and 5pm) The shelter is still CLOSED to the public so we have to do the meets outside in the parking lot. \n\nWe do not have an adoption fee or an application fee. Animals do have to be sterilized and vaccinated before they leave if they havent been already. Its the law if you adopt from a municiple shelter. The veterinarian you choose will get your money. Not us. \n\nApplications are on our petfinder page (link above). If you decide to send one please attach a photo copy of your ID/DL. We cannot process it until we have that. The process can take anywhere from 2-8 days. \n\nApplications are sent to dbroughton@petersburg-va.org\n\nAlways call the shelter if you need more info or have any other inquiries. If we cannot get to the phone right away please leave a voice message. We are extremely understaffed right now so thank you in advance for your patience! \n\n",

He was told Bruno was a full blooded German Shepherd but we believe him to be a mix.  Maybe with German Shepherd and another Shepherd type or Boxer.  His owner had him as an indoor pet his entire life and really loved him.  However, Bruno has allergies to fleas and had experienced flea dermatitis that was untreated for so long that his skin on his leg and especially his back was in really bad and sore condition when we took him in.  The owner felt bad and said he never treated him with a vet just meds he could buy at the store that never worked.  He said Bruno deserves better.  We took him to the vet and he had a really bad bacterial infection on his back and legs an is being treated for a full month with antibiotics and steriods.  We plan for a full recovery.  His owner had to move out of state for another job due to loss of job from COVID times and was forced to give him up.  It was a sad day for his owner but he knew he would be better off medically.  We had Bruno's shots updated and he is heartworm negative.  He was treated for intestinal worms and is on flea meds now.  We will have him neutered and microchipped once his skin condition is resolved.  Having surgery with bacterial infection on his skin was pretty risky for his recovery per the vet.  We are hoping to have him neutered in February.  He is shy at first but once he knows you is really sweet.  He was with another dog that was small in his first two years of life.  He loves to chase a tennis ball.  Due to his skin issue and not being around young kids, we reccommend kids over 7 as the young ones may scare him.  He has a sweet soul and deserves the best.\n\nBruno's adoption fee is $350 and will help cover his vet bills.  \n\nIf you are interested in Bruno, apply at our main page at www.lifehouse.petfinder.com.  If you have questions about Bruno, contact Holly via text or call at 615-310-5996.",

Let's get my important requirements for a new home out of the way first.  \nRequirements are - people to love, lots of cuddle time, a soft bed, walks and treats - carrots being my very favorite.\n\nI had been living in a home before coming to Red Collar Rescue.  I attended obedience training and know lots of commands like sit, stay, lay down, leave, spin, come and high five.  As you can see I am very smart.  Also sweet and calm.\n\nI absolutely love to be around my people.  I like to play tug with a rope and Kong toys filled with peanut butter & kibble.  \n\nWant to know more - contact info@redcollar.org.\nAdoption applications can be submitted on website, redcollar.org\n\nAge - 5 to 6 years\nWeight - 45 to 50 lbs.\nDogs - okay\nCats - no\nKids - older kids okay\nVaccinated - yes\nNeutered - yes\nMicrochipped - yes\nNeeds foster - yes",

Let's get my important requirements for a new home out of the way first.  \nRequirements are - people to love, lots of cuddle time, a soft bed, walks and treats - carrots being my very favorite.\n\nI had been living in a home before coming to Red Collar Rescue.  I attended obedience training and know lots of commands like sit, stay, lay down, leave, spin, come and high five.  As you can see I am very smart.  Also sweet and calm.\n\nI absolutely love to be around my people.  I like to play tug with a rope and Kong toys filled with peanut butter & kibble.  \n\nWant to know more - contact info@redcollar.org.\nAdoption applications can be submitted on website, redcollar.org\n\nAge - 5 to 6 years\nWeight - 45 to 50 lbs.\nDogs - okay\nCats - no\nKids - older kids okay\nVaccinated - yes\nNeutered - yes\nMicrochipped - yes\nNeeds foster - yes",

            "description": "\"Hi. Thanks for visiting me online! My name is Brooklyn and I am around 4 years old, new to the adoptable doggy crew and I can\u2019t wait to move into my forever home. I'm all set to join my new family - already spayed, microchipped and up to date on vaccinations.\n\nI'm currently staying with a foster family who is learning more about me.  My foster momma describes me as a shy and nervous girl. I am looking for the right home that is patient and can help me feel more comfortable with my surroundings. \n\nMy foster momma thinks my ideal home would be an adult only home with a secure fenced in yard. I do love to have fun running, building up to full-on zoomies! No apartments or city lifestyles for me. There are too many loud noises that I am unsure of and frighten me. As for animal roommates, I prefer male dogs over females. I can get a bit competitive, so my doggie BFF will be a well balanced, social, easygoing pup! Cat roommates? No thanks - they're just not for me.\n\nI know that I'm super adorable, but I am looking for a home experienced with fearful dogs like me. I'm a sensitive girl who needs an understanding home. If you are serious about embarking on this journey with me, please email your completed adoption profile (found here: https://providenceac.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Adoption-Profile.pdf) to cmuller@providenceac.org with an explanation of your experience with fearful dogs. \n\nTail wags and kisses - Brooklyn\"\n\n____\n\n\nProvidence Animal Center relies on adoption fees and donations to save pets! Adoption fees vary per pet. To find out this pet\u2019s adoption fee or for more information, please call the Adoption Center with this pet\u2019s ID number.\n\nCan\u2019t adopt? Consider fostering or donating! Visit https://providenceac.org/support-us/ for more information on how you can support the lifesaving mission!",

A calm quiet household would be best for an older gal like her. While she has lived with kids in the past, we do think she would do better with no kids, or older kids with prior dog experience. Her gentle personality and love of her people makes her the perfect companion pup. \n\nMolly loves being with her people so much that a family with someone home often is ideal. She has lived with cats before, so kitty siblings are a possibility, and she has made a doggy friend here at the shelter, so a dog-respectful-dog sibling is a possibility as well (meet and greet with other dogs is a must). \n\nMolly has a few medical concerns. She appears to be deaf and has cataracts, but still has decent vision. She also has a grade V/VI heart murmur and severe spine, hip, and wrist arthritis. She has responded well to pain and joint medication, and loves to trot around and sniff everything with her beagle nose! \n\nDespite being a little old lady Molly still has a lot of spunk, and would love a nice retirement home to spend her golden years!\n\nInterested in this beautiful senior? Give us a call to schedule an appointment. Meets by appointment only. 518-885-4113. \n\n*If you are a Saratoga County resident 60 or older, the adoption fee is waived for Molly.",

She can be a little shy around people she doesn\u2019t know, but no one remains a stranger for long with this sweetheart. Affectionate and loving, she quickly becomes everyone\u2019s favorite companion. Kiara is house trained, has wonderful manners, and rides well in the car. She is not a fan of her crate, but her foster family tells us that she is not destructive and has been trustworthy in the home. Nothing makes Kiara happier than playing in the yard with the kids and foster dog sibling, and she will settle down easily on her bed afterward for a nap. She is truly the best dog! \n\nKiara was picked up as a stray by Animal Control in South Carolina. They could see she had recently had puppies, but sadly the puppies were nowhere to be found. This dear, gentle girl has been thriving in her foster home and enjoying all the loving attention family life has to offer. She deserves a wonderful forever family of her own, and would do well in a home with children or a companion dog.  You don't want to miss out on this amazing girl!\n\n\nThank you so much for your interest in adopting a dog from A New Chance Animal Rescue (https://anewchancear.org). We are a 501c3, tax deductible organization. ANCAR is a foster-based rescue, and we adopt within a 90 mile radius of Bedford Hills, NY.  You will find the adoption application here: (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-application/).  All fields on the application must be completed.\nPlease read about the adoption process (https://anewchancear.org/adopt/adoption-process/) so you'll know what to expect when you submit.   \n\nOur dogs are in foster care and we do NOT have a shelter or boarding facility. AN APPLICATION MUST BE COMPLETED IN FULL AND APPROVED BEFORE A DOG CAN BE MET. This is a firm policy. Our busy volunteers are not able to respond to questions about the dog or dog meeting requests in the absence of an application.  We know these dogs very well because they are in foster care. Please read the profiles of the dog(s) you are interested in prior to submitting an application.  If there are specific requirements stated (ie: Fenced Yard or Canine Friend Required) these are included because they are vital to the happiness, health, safety and adoption success of that dog. \n\nWe are only able to save as many dogs as we have foster homes (https://anewchancear.org/foster/faqs/) and resources for. We provide medical care including vaccinations, testing, deworming, spaying/neutering and microchipping before transporting our dogs. We provide all supplies, preventatives and any follow up vet care necessary while they are in foster care. These costs are high and the number of lives we can save is entirely dependent upon donations from people like you.  We do not receive funding from private foundations or government sources. If you can find room in your heart to help us, with any amount, we are truly grateful (https://anewchancear.org/help/donate/). We are a 501c3 organization, so all donations are tax-deductible. It is only through the kindness of supporters like you that we are 'changing lives...one tail at a time' by providing our dogs with 'A New Chance.' (https://anewchancear.org) \n\nThanks so much.",

He's a real cuddle bug and he'll happily hang out with his head in your lap while you work at your computer. He's also fond of sleeping next to you. He's got a great disposition and his friendly to everyone he meets. He loves going on walks and he would make a great hiking companion (and he's good in the car).\n\nDevin is a smart cookie who knows his basic commands and really wants to please. He's also quite content to hang out on the couch and nibble at his chew toys. Devin is a super sweet dog and would make a great family dog. He's a big guy (65 lbs) and he is active so he would probably do best in an active home with older kids. We are sure he would love a yard!

We are working on crate training and potty training. She is very timid but she is slowly warming up to us. Spice would do best with another dog in the house. Also, just because she is so timid I wouldn't recommend small children in the home. She needs to be around people that can respect her boundaries.",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Buster and I was rescued from a shelter in Georgia before arriving at the Big Dog Ranch Rescue. I am a super friendly boy who just loves to howl, bark, and talk to everyone. I like to play with all other dogs, regardless of their size, and I would be an excellent fit for a family with children looking for a dog to pal around with. An experienced dog owner would probably be best for me and I know I would be happiest living in a home with a big yard for me to run around in. I could benefit from some further training, particularly potty-training because I haven't quite mastered that yet, but I do let myself in and out of my kennel when I need to use the bathroom here on the ranch. I know how to sit and shake, and I've also started learning how to walk on a leash. I would love it if I could have a new owner who could help me learn lots of new and fun things!",

She is very sweet and loves to cuddle with her mom.\n\nUpdate on Wilma's health - Wilma will be with us for at least a month or more - she has giardia and coccydia which we are treating.

After seeing a vet, he was diagnosed with puppy strangles. We named him Jelly Bean and he stayed in the hospital for 48 hours. He went to his foster home, where he has been for 33 days, and flourished like no other! Not only does his face look 100 times better, he is also feeling great and his little personality is awesome! He is such a smart, big boy! He is currently 13 weeks old and weighs 27lbs. He is going to be a big boy, as we were told he is a Border Collie mixed with a Saint Bernard. We can believe it! He likes to heard by nipping his foster brothers and sister in the side, biting in the butt and you know....several other hearding ways...that\u2019s his job, so he thinks. Ha. \n\nJelly Beans foster mom thinks he would be very cat curious and a home with laid back cats or no cats at all would be best. He LOVES other dogs, but a playful companion would be the best fit for him. He is also pretty good at entertaining himself, another dog is not required. Jelly bean has been exclusively working on potty training. He does a great job of not going potty in his crate while his foster mom is at work. He is also crate trained. Jelly Bean would do best with kiddos older than 5, due to his rambunctiousness. \n\nJelly Bean is your typical puppy, but just a tad bit more rambunctious. A family with loads of time for him and extra love to give, is his dream family. He also told his foster mom a home with good food and toys is a must. We promised him that! Do you have loads of time and love, good toys and good food for our boy Jelly Bean? If so, hop on over to our website and fill out an application! https://sianimalrescue.org Jelly Beans adoption fee is $200 and includes his neuter, age appropriate vaccines, deworming, microchip with registration and he has been current on heartworm, flea and tick prevention.\n\nLocated in Jeffersonville, IN.\n\n\n\nAdoption fee $200\n**\u00a0To arrange a meeting go to www.sianimalrescue.org and submit an application**\n I will come (Neutered, current on vaccines, micro chipped, fecal, heart worm tested if age appropriate, monthly flea and tick prevented, dental if recommended by our vet.\n\nIf you are already in love with me you have the option of reserving/pre adopting after your application has been approved.

It took us about 10 minutes upon meeting him again (as an adult) before he relaxed and became playful. Yummy treats definitely helped him!\nHis owner is very ill and having to move in with family and is needs to find a loving home for him. He is currently neutered, microchipped and fully vetted. He is available for adoption thru Grumpy Puppy Rescue.\n\nIf you would like to meet Iggy, please start by filling out an adoption application for pre-approval by clicking this link:\n\nhttps://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/GPRI/Dog\n\nIf you would like to stay updated, here is the link to our facebook group:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/177053679384280",

Please complete an adopter profile to set up your meet and greet: http://coastalpetrescue.org/adopt/profile\n\nAdoption Fees:\nKittens: $60, Cats (1 year plus): $50, Puppies: $250, Adult Canines (1 to 6 years): $200, Seniors (7 years plus): $100 (unless otherwise specified). Adoption fees are not a tax-deductible donation as allowed by IRS regulations. Adoption fees help to offset the cost of the pet's care incurred by Coastal Pet Rescue, which are generally 2 to 3 times the adoption fee amount.\nSome special circumstances may change the fee; see pet's listing for actual adoption fee.\n\nAll Coastal Pet Rescue pets are current on shots, microchipped* and spayed/neutered prior to adoption. Adopters are responsible for any shots that may be due after adoption (particularly for kittens and puppies that must have three rounds of shots to be protected).\n\nMicrochip:\nCPR has implanted a microchip as part of the adoption process and the chip is included in the adoption fee. However, some chip companies require a registration fee varying from $9.99 to $19.99. The registration fees are the responsibility of the adopter and are NOT included in the CPR adoption fee. Adopters may add this cost to their adoption fee to have CPR register the chip on their behalf.\n\n30 Days Pet Insurance: \nAs a Petfinder member, all adopters are entitled to a free 30 day insurance policy through PetFirst. Coastal Pet Rescue is not responsible for this policy. Adopters must call PetFirst\u2019s toll-free number 855-710-7387 to activate the coverage. If adopters fail to call, the policy will not be activated.\n",

Please complete an adopter profile to set up your meet and greet: http://coastalpetrescue.org/adopt/profile\n\nAdoption Fees:\nKittens: $60, Cats (1 year plus): $50, Puppies: $250, Adult Canines (1 to 6 years): $200, Seniors (7 years plus): $100 (unless otherwise specified). Adoption fees are not a tax-deductible donation as allowed by IRS regulations. Adoption fees help to offset the cost of the pet's care incurred by Coastal Pet Rescue, which are generally 2 to 3 times the adoption fee amount.\nSome special circumstances may change the fee; see pet's listing for actual adoption fee.\n\nAll Coastal Pet Rescue pets are current on shots, microchipped* and spayed/neutered prior to adoption. Adopters are responsible for any shots that may be due after adoption (particularly for kittens and puppies that must have three rounds of shots to be protected).\n\nMicrochip:\nCPR has implanted a microchip as part of the adoption process and the chip is included in the adoption fee. However, some chip companies require a registration fee varying from $9.99 to $19.99. The registration fees are the responsibility of the adopter and are NOT included in the CPR adoption fee. Adopters may add this cost to their adoption fee to have CPR register the chip on their behalf.\n\n30 Days Pet Insurance: \nAs a Petfinder member, all adopters are entitled to a free 30 day insurance policy through PetFirst. Coastal Pet Rescue is not responsible for this policy. Adopters must call PetFirst\u2019s toll-free number 855-710-7387 to activate the coverage. If adopters fail to call, the policy will not be activated.\n",

This Adoption fee includes: mandatory spay/neuter which will be done before you can take your dog or puppy home with you; basic canine immunizations (DHPP-CPV & Bordatella Intranasal); de-wormings; one-year rabies vaccination if old enough; heartworm test if over five months old; microchip from 24-Pet Watch; certificate for free health examination at your participating veterinarian; and a goodie bag chocked full of information, toys, and more.\nThe first step to do an adoption is to do our Adoption Application here: https://www.elmorehumane.org/adoption-application-online-form2.html\nIMPORTANT - we respond to your emailed applications and queries via email back to you. Please make sure you have either added our email (hselco@bellsouth.net) to your contact list or that you routinely check your SPAM folder for our response just to be safe. If we do not receive a timely response we simply move on to another applicant.\nYes, there are sometimes exceptions to our normal fee for older dogs or special cases. Some of our pets have also been lovingly sponsored by caring people and we will let the approved adopter know about that at the point of adoption. Visit our Website at: http://www.elmorehumane.org The staff would also like to remind you that for faster response to inquiries about adoptable animals to have the animals ID#, name & description. This way your questions will be answered in a timely manner.\nAll pet adoption websites & our shelter management software require that we choose a primary and/or secondary breed for our dogs. While our staff is quite breed knowledgeable, in many cases we are truly making our best guesses as to their breed(s) based on many factors but cannot promise that what we have said is accurate. So taking into account your own parameters for things such as size, coat care, activity level, etc please come and get to know our dog(s) as individuals to see if their personalities and yours are a forever match.\nPhone: (334) 567-3377 Fax: (334) 567-8774 E-mail: hselco@bellsouth.net",

            "description": "\tTate is an amazing 18 month-2 year old Aussie mix. He was born blind and hearing impaired, but that does not slow him down one bit. He navigates around very well and learns new places very quickly. This active guy weighs about 35-40lbs. He loves playing in the backyard with his foster siblings and snuggling with his humans. Every time you look at him it\u2019s hard not to smile because he is just such a happy fella. He is sure to bring lots of happiness and love in his forever home. He loves people and is the definition of \u201cvelcro dog.\u201d Tate is housetrained when kept on a schedule. He rides well in the car and walks well on a leash. Exploring the yard and going on walks are two of Tate\u2019s favorite things to do.\n\nTate is up to date on vaccines and preventatives, neutered, and microchipped. He is currently being fostered in Huntsville, AL. If you are interested in making Tate a forever part of your family please fill out a non-binding application for him at www.forrescue.net/dog-application.",

Be sure to tell them ARK sent you!  \n\nMeet Percy, a 6-year old male Great Pyrenees / Lab mix located in the Boston area. At one hundred pounds, he\u2019s a lot of dog to wrap your arms around and his heart is as big as his body. He is neutered, up-to-date on vaccinations, and available for foster or adoption in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Connecticut through our furr-iends at Survivor Tails Rescue. \n\nPercy is a beach bum and nature lover. He enjoys hanging out with people at home or on the trails. He loves to hike and swim, and would thrive with an active, nature-loving owner. He is loyal towards friends and family but wary of strangers, especially men. He prefers the ladeez, so his family will include an experienced female family member.\n\nPercy has certain home and family needs to ensure his success, including a quiet child-free environment with little comings and goings. He also needs to be the only fur-kid. A big boy like Percy needs space to roam and stretch his legs, so he\u2019s specifically looking for a single-family home with fenced-in yard. \n\nLuckily, Percy loves to learn and will be attending a board and train program prior to joining his new family in hopes of boosting his confidence and social prowess. With such valuable training on his resume, his family must be willing and able to keep up his skills. \n\nPercy will need an active, experienced family, but his loyalty makes him well worth the effort. If you are interested in adopting or fostering, please fill out an application at survivortails.org or email adoptions@survivortails.org with any questions. PLEASE tell them ARK sent you! #ARKforPercy\n\n\n\n\n~ THIS IS A COURTESY POST PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT MASSPAWS ~\nThis dog is with Survivor Tails Animal Rescue (STAR) please fill out an application: survivortails.org or email adoptions@survivortails.org with any questions.

He has a great personality and is very feisty. \nPistol Pete came to Prairie Paws with a group of dogs in a kill shelter in Texas. Pete is getting used to other pets in the foster home including dogs his size, cats and young respectful kids.\nPistol Pete was not neutered when he came to our rescue,  so he has been marking(peeing) on things. You see him in a belly band in several pictures.  He was neutered on 12/29-so the marking usually subsides after a few weeks. The adopter will need to follow routines the foster family uses for house and crate training. While being neutered,  the vet found a b.b. inside him-so apparently he was shot at before coming to us. The b.b. was removed \nThis lovable  little guy uis not sure what to think about the cold ND winters as he probably has never seen snow and cold in Texas.\nPistol Pete will make some one a great little companion.\nAll medical work is completed prior to adoption including neutering shots worming flea treatment rabies shot micro chip heartworm test and vet exam. \nThe adoption fee is $150 +tax with an approved application.  The application is on the website www.prairiepawsrescue.com and go to the adopt link to download the jotform application fill it out and submit. \nPrairie Paws Rescue does not adopt on a first come basis but who will provide the best home suited to the pets needs. \n",

Please complete an adopter profile to set up your meet and greet: http://coastalpetrescue.org/adopt/profile\n\nAdoption Fees:\nKittens: $60, Cats (1 year plus): $50, Puppies: $250, Adult Canines (1 to 6 years): $200, Seniors (7 years plus): $100 (unless otherwise specified). Adoption fees are not a tax-deductible donation as allowed by IRS regulations. Adoption fees help to offset the cost of the pet's care incurred by Coastal Pet Rescue, which are generally 2 to 3 times the adoption fee amount.\nSome special circumstances may change the fee; see pet's listing for actual adoption fee.\n\nAll Coastal Pet Rescue pets are current on shots, microchipped* and spayed/neutered prior to adoption. Adopters are responsible for any shots that may be due after adoption (particularly for kittens and puppies that must have three rounds of shots to be protected).\n\nMicrochip:\nCPR has implanted a microchip as part of the adoption process and the chip is included in the adoption fee. However, some chip companies require a registration fee varying from $9.99 to $19.99. The registration fees are the responsibility of the adopter and are NOT included in the CPR adoption fee. Adopters may add this cost to their adoption fee to have CPR register the chip on their behalf.\n\n30 Days Pet Insurance: \nAs a Petfinder member, all adopters are entitled to a free 30 day insurance policy through PetFirst. Coastal Pet Rescue is not responsible for this policy. Adopters must call PetFirst\u2019s toll-free number 855-710-7387 to activate the coverage. If adopters fail to call, the policy will not be activated.\n",

I'm a happy boy who loves to be around my people. Do you have a spot on the couch for me to snuggle beside you? I would love it!! I also really enjoy playing with toys. My foster mom says I'm very food motivated, and will work hard to earn a treat from you. I like to go on walks, and according to my foster parents I do pretty well on my leash and I'm continuing to improve as I practice more. I am just a baby after all!\n\nI am looking for a home that can continue to help me be my best! Sometimes new things and loud noises are a little scary for me, but with time and as I become comfortable, I am getting better! My foster mom tells me I'm very sweet, and I would love to show you just how much love I have to give! Are you ready to adopt? I would love to meet you! Submit an application today!\n\nhttp://Bit.ly/WHBRadopt\n\nwww.Wigglinhomeboxerrescue.org\nEmail: wigglinhomeboxerrescue@gmail.com\nPhone (360) 723-0219",

            "description": "Age:10 Weight: 40 Location: Frederick MD Nicknames: Dutchy, Moaning Myrtle, Trixie Good with other dogs?: Yes. But she doesn't like sharing things. She will warn but not start a fight. Dutchy is ok with other dogs, except she has some resource guarding issues. She guards her food, toys and treats. It is mild. Good with cats? unknown, will not be adopted to a home with a cat Good with children? unknown, will not be adopted to a home with kids under 10 Activity Preference: Low maintenance overall but needs quality outside time., Will go with the flow IQ: Average Dutchess's favorite things: Dutchy's two favorite things are soft things and treats. She will only lay on a blanket and hunts something soft to sit or lay on. She also is treat motivated and her butt drops through the floor if there is a treat in your hand. Dutchess is good at: meeting people, meeting dogs, staying in a crate, behaving in the house, going for car rides, walking on a leash Ideal home: no children, someone at home most of the day, a fenced yard Training Needs: needs obedience training Health issues: Dutchy has a peculiar walk. According to the vet, she has some kind of a deformity that does not cause her pain. She also had 5 teeth removed. None of these seem to be causing her issues now.\nThings Dutchy is not, or does not enjoy\nDutchy is NOT dog aggressive\nDutchy is not aggressive towards humans\nDutchy is not overly loving\nDutchy does not enjoy being told what to do\nDutchy does not share ANYTHING well\nDutchy is NOT a good runner\nDutchy Is not a model\nThings Dutchy is and or likes\nDutchy wants to listen and make you happy, when it is convenient for her\nDutchy loves soft things\nDutchy is vocal about her disapproval of something with wailing and moaning\nDutchy is opinionated and always believes her stance is correct, no matter what\nDutchy does very well in a crate\nDutchy does well with other dogs as long as anything she could \"posses\" is not available. (Think, water, ice cube, food, toy)\nDutchy is very odd and has very cute mannerisms\nDutchy does very well with routines\nDutchy does great playing a cat, think (pet me, pet me, pet me, then why are you touching me as you get a growl( NOT AGGRESSIVE!))\nDutchy loves a walk around the block twice a day\nDutchy is great at not having accidents in the house\nDutchy is great for watching TV with.\nDutchy will let you know she doesn't want to do something, sometimes with a small growl\nDutchy is good at not chewing things\nDutchy is very good at taking treats\nMeet Dutchess\nDutchy is one of a kind! She is a very unique gal who is looking for someone to treat her like the Dutchess of Grantham.\nDutchy has had a tough life and it shows at first. We got her and had her spayed and 5 rotten teeth removed. This damaged the trust we had and she took a long time to warm back up to us. I will break down what we know about Dutchy\nDutchy and routines- Dutchy loves a routine. It only takes her a couple of times and she understands what she is supposed to do, and does it like a champ. We would strongly recommend a routine of breakfast, bathroom breaks, feedings, walks etc. This seemed to help her feel at home. I would highly recommend a regimented routine to help her feel at home during her first couple of weeks. Once she has learned the routine it continues until you break her of it. If you always potty after food, she will expect it every time. Routines are key for her to start.\nDutchy and her Mannerisms Dutchy has some uncanny and odd mannerisms. She has cat-like mannerisms. If she needs attention, she will let you know she needs attention. She has gotten the nickname Moaning Myrtle in our house due to her letting us know she needs something. Her looks and mood are just as funny as she is. She is a dog of many funny looks and moods, you just have to figure out how to read them to know what she needs at that time. If you are willing to put in the work to figure her out, you will be rewarded (with a mouth around your forearm lol).\nDutchy and her resource guarding. Dutchy does have some issues with resource guarding. It isn't all the time and you don't know when she will exhibit these behaviors. One day I can feed her and be in the kitchen with her and all is good. The next day I am not allowed in the kitchen without some growling. She definitely guards toys and chewy treats, which is why we listed her as an only dog. We would be unsure if she guards beds, spots on the floor, etc.\nDutchy and her interaction with other dogs. Dutchy has met and socialized with our dog and it has gone ok so far. As mentioned early, dutchy has some very peculiar mannerisms that include staring and putting her tail straight up. We took this as a sign of aggression at first, but we are thinking now, it is just Dutchy being Dutchy. That being said, she is never left with our dog unsupervised, even for a minute.\nDutchy and her interactions with us. Dutchy is not overly loving, nor overly interactive with us. She prefers a nice soft environment where she feels safe. As mentioned earlier we had her 3 days before her spay and tooth extraction, so we broke any trust we had. She is slowly starting to warm up to us, but still prefers to go her own way. She does want to be near you at times, and will cuddle up if allowed. She also will try to put her whole mouth around a part of your body. We don't allow this behavior, but it does not seem like she is trying to bite or do anything sinister. We refer back to the cat-like behavior of just doing something to do something. Overall she is a funny dog to just sit and watch as she beebops and stumbles across the room.\nWhat Dutchy needs to live her best life. Dutchy needs a home where she is the only dog, free of kids and has a regimented schedule. She needs someone who is patient and understanding and will provide love when Dutchy requires it. She loves a walk or two a day and enjoys smelling all the things. She is a special little girl who, while odd, is a great companion and will make someone happy.\nDon't let the above scare you. The best way to describe dutchess is to give you an analogy. I'm sure we all know the elderly lady at target who runs over your foot with her electric wheelchair and then makes you apologize because your foot was in her way. Next thing you know, you are sitting having a glass of whiskey with said lady and enjoying your time....that elderly lady is dutchess.\n\nTo be considered for adoption, you must apply using our free, online application. Our dogs are fostered in our volunteers' homes, not in a central shelter/location. Only approved applicants are put into contact with the foster family to setup a meeting with the foster dog.

Please DO NOT CONTACT EAPL about courtesy listings. The pet owner/rescue/shelter and new owner shall make all arrangements on transferring the pet, information on history, vaccines, etc.\n\nAny further questions, please call Doug at 303-670-7792 or email at\ndworld2.0@gmail.com\n\nHer rehoming fee is $250\n\nKeegan is a 16 month old American Pit Bull Terrier located in Evergreen. She weighs 52 pounds and is a beautiful tan brindle with golden eyes. She is spayed and up to date on all vaccinations and is in very good health. She is full bred and came from a reputable breeder in California. She was hand picked from a large litter for her balanced temperament. Both parents also had great temperaments. She has been raised in a loving home in Colorado since she was 8 weeks old. She has a very friendly disposition and is extremely intelligent. She completed a 4 week puppy obedience course with Friends for Life and also an 8 week adult obedience course with Terroux Dog Training by the time she was 8 months old. A lot of time was spent socializing her with people and other dogs through dog socials and daycare, as well as regular trips to places like parks, walks around the lake and trips to Home Depot. She has really good basic obedience and knows commands like sit, down, stand, wait, stay, come. Her obedience is good in the house and on leash outside of the house. As she's only 16 months old, it's still a work in progress off leash outside of the yard. She rides well in a car also.\n\nShe is very friendly with other dogs and has spent time off and on leash with a bunch of dogs either playing and walking in the neighborhood or at socials/training. She loves dogs and does really well with all that are not overly dominant or aggressive. She is respectful of older dogs that want space and of not being too rough with smaller ones. Given the opportunity, she really loves to run around with other dogs off leash and play. As far as living with another dog, I think she may really enjoy that, assuming the other dog was a good match. She has a lot of energy but is very good about being calm and relaxed in the house as long as she gets proper exercise and mental stimulation. She has not spent much time around cats but has been very respectful of the cats she met at the vet clinic. Kids over 10 would probably be best. Once again, she is extremely intelligent and loves to learn new things. Tricks, obedience, tasks, it doesn't matter, she loves to learn and is extremely trainable. Want to teach a dog 100 tricks, this is your girl. She is very good about being left in the house out of a crate on her own and is not destructive of anything in the house. She is fully crate trained though the only time she spends in her crate is when she goes in there on her own for a break. She is a pit bull and has to have pit bull appropriate chew toys as she is capable of destroying anything less and may consume parts if she destroys it. I have found the toys that work best for her and can provide those to the new owner and give advice. She does not chew things other than toys she is given. She loves durable chew toys and balls such as the orange Chuck it balls and loves to play fetch. She still loves to be outside during the winter but may require a coat/sweatshirt in the colder months as she has a very short coat.\n\nShe's a really good dog and doesn't have any \"issues\". The only reason she is being rehomed is because I have encountered some unfortunate life circumstances/changes and don't have the time to give her the exercise and attention that she truly deserves. She is a great dog and I just want her to live a happy enriched life with people that love her. Her ideal home would have a large fenced yard where she can really run and play. She is 100% an inside dog when she is not outside playing/walking. Her ideal people would be active as she has a lot of energy and loves to walk, hike, run, explore. She really would enjoy calm, happy people the most. She would love owners that stimulate her through training or activities. It is very important that she does not live with anyone that has anger or anxiety issues as she is a sweet, sensitive girl that responds best to positive reinforcement and a loving, stable environment. She will be an absolute treat to own for the person or family that wants an intelligent, fun girl to enjoy life with. She comes with all the dog supplies you need as far as a crate, beds, leashes, food, toys etc. Any further questions, please call Doug at 303-670-7792 or email at dworld2.0@gmail.com.",

            "description": "Yeti was born with a short front arm missing a paw. It doesn't stop him any, although stairs can be a little problematic for him. He's the cutest little guy with a forever smile. Yeti is a typical puppy with typical puppy behaviors and alot of energy. He's 3-4 months old, up to date on vaccines, microchipped, and will be neutered under the rescue when age appropriate. Yeti needs an experienced pet parent as he is just starting to learn boundaries. He plays hard with other dogs and we feel he would be best as an only dog. A fenced yard is an absolute must for this boy. Visit www.3hearts4paws.org to apply\n\nInterested in adopting me? To fill out an application visit 3 Hearts 4 Paws. Please note: we generally do not adopt out of state unless it is within 1-2 hours of us. Currently due to COVID we are unable to accommodate out of state adoptions.",

Her only flaw is they she wants all of the attention, toys, treats, and home to herself. She will need to be the only pet, no children under the age of 15, and a physically fenced yard.  If you happen to meet all these requirements and would consider adopting Jojo, please fill out an application today. \n\nThe Animal Rescue Project (www.animalrescueproject.org) is committed to the best possible veterinary care for the pets it rescues and it is looking for adopters who will be similarly committed.\n\nAll dogs and puppies are given a general check-up when they enter our program. They receive medication to remove any intestinal parasites (worms), fleas, and ticks they may have. Dogs greater than six months of age are checked for heartworm. If heartworm positive, the Animal Rescue Project treats the disease. Dogs and pups receive all age-appropriate vaccinations for distemper, and dogs greater than four months of age are also vaccinated for rabies, in compliance with State of Michigan laws. All dogs are also microchipped.\n\nMost dogs and older puppies are spayed or neutered before adoption. In the case of puppies not old enough to be safely sterilized, a $50 deposit is required at the time of adoption and is refunded to the adopter with proof of sterilization.\n\nThe Animal Rescue Project requires every adopter to establish an active relationship with a veterinarian no later than 10 days after adoption. Adopters will receive a plan for routine veterinary care at the time of adoption and are expected to work with their vet to complete the plan.",

            "description": "\"Well, hello there! Thanks for visiting me online! My name is Crawford, and I am around 4 years old and about 54 pounds. I just joined the adoptable doggy crew at Providence Animal Center after traveling here from Georgia, and I can\u2019t wait to move into my new forever home. My adoption day is all I can think about, so please don\u2019t make me wait too long!\n\nThe staff & volunteers are still getting to know me, but so far they've learned that I'm a playful, cautious, curious pup who has been known to catch a case of the zoomies now and again!\n\nThey think that I'd likely do well living with kid pals who are age 8 & older, if the home's general noise & commotion level doesn't rival that of a circus! As I'm still getting used to all the stressful changes in my world after living with the same family for my entire life down south, I will thrive with a forever family who has the time and patience to help me blossom into the best me that I can be. \n\nI've really been enjoying spending time with the volunteers here who give me time out of my kennel. I'm even starting to lean in for pets and giving smooches :)\n\nI'm all set to join my new family - already neutered, microchipped and up to date on vaccinations.  So, if you'd like to meet me in person, just schedule an appointment here: ProvidenceAC.org/AdoptADog. I have my bags all packed - I just need my forever family to find me. XOXO ~Crawford\n\nP.S. Someone is so excited for me to find my fur-ever home, that they have sponsored my adoption fee! That means I can join your family today for FREE! Woohoo!!\"\n\n-------\nDuring your appointment, you will be able to meet a selection of pets in the Kennels or Cattery that day. New pets are arriving daily!\n-------\n\nProvidence Animal Center relies on adoption fees and donations to save pets! Adoption fees vary per pet. To find out this pet\u2019s adoption fee or for more information, please call the Adoption Center with this pet\u2019s ID number.\n\nCan\u2019t adopt? Consider fostering or donating! Visit https://providenceac.org/support-us/ for more information on how you can support the lifesaving mission!",

She spent many years in a situation where she was neglected and abused so she's happy to just have a warm, stable, secure place to call her own.\n\nHer past life has left her scarred emotionally, so she's looking for a quiet, calm place to spend her golden years (she's estimated to be around 14 y/o). She isn't suitable for a home with other pets, nor small children; both could elicit a fear response of growling and possibly nipping. She also wasn't spayed until recently, so in new environments, she can exhibit marking behavior until she realizes she is in \"\"her own\"\" space.\n\nIf these traits don't intimidate you, please, reach out. We will go over her extensive medical history, and you will be AMAZED at what she's overcome. She truly is a miracle pup who needs a home with patience and the understanding that she will never be a \"\"purse pup\"\" who wants to socialize with the masses.Please submit an Adoption Application here: www.rocthedogsrescue.com",

Adopting a senior dog has so many rewards, please consider making Colby your new best friend!!!Please read the animal bios completely before requesting additional information as we do our best to answer the most frequently ask questions in these bios. \n\nIn order to adopt one of our animals an application must be submitted and approved. You can find these applications by going to http://humanemorgan.org/index.php?page=adoption \n\nABOUT ADOPTING FROM THE HSMC: \nThe shelter address is 1170 Fairground Rd. Madison, GA 30650. For more information on any of our pets, please feel free to email us at INFO@HUMANEMORGAN.ORG give us a call at 706-343-9977. \nAll dogs are heartworm negative, current on vaccines/dewormings, and microchipped. \nAll cats are FeLv/FIV negative, current on vaccines/dewormings, and microchipped. \nWe are open 10am-5pm Monday-Saturday, we schedule our last adoption at 4pm everyday to allow our staff enough time to feed and walk dogs. \nWe are an animal shelter and therefore are not able to individually potty train our residents. Many adult dogs do arrive \"\"house broken\"\" however due to animal behavior any change in environment will make an emotional impact on the animals and therefore initiate unwanted behaviors during the acclamation period. Please keep this in mind. Puppies do not have the biological maturity to maintain absolute bladder or bowel control and will require a certain degree of potty training and house breaking. Please consider the time and commitment it takes to provide the necessary building blocks for these special babies, prior to submitting your application. \nIf you have any questions please email us at info@humanemorgan.org and provide name of the animal you are interested in, in the subject line. \nThank you, HSMC Staff \n\nADOPTION FEES Adoption Fees may change without notice. Always verify the fee when finalizing the adoption. \n~ Cats and Kittens ~ \n* Under 1 Year = $100 \n* 1-5 Years = $75 \n* Over 5 Years = $50 \n** Purebred cats and kittens may be subject to special pricing \n\n~ Mix Breed Dogs ~ \n* Under 1 Year = $200 \n* 1 -3 Years = $175 \n* 4-8 Years = $150 \n* Over 8 Years = $100\n\n~ Purebred and Designer Breed Dogs ~ \n* Under 1 Year = $375 \n* 1-3 Years = $350 \n* 4-8 Years = $275 \n* Over 8 Years = $150 \n\n~ Medical and Special Needs ~ \nWe have rescued dogs and cats which require additional medical care or that have special needs which are not life threatening.

            "description": "Eden is a Siberia husky mix who was surrendered to a NE Alabama shelter as a stray. She was obviously well cared for and appeared housebroken, but no one ever came to claim her. She is currently in foster care in Alabama where she will be cared for until she can be brought to Wisconsin in January to find her furever family. She does well with other dogs after proper introduction but can be dominant and likes to hog all her foster mom's attention. She would probably do best as an only dog or in a home with a submissive dog. If interested in adopting. Please go to sandipaws.org and complete an online adoption application today.\nThank you for your interest in a Sandi Paws Rescue, Inc. Please visit our site at sandipaws.org for more information on our organization or to fill out an application to adopt one of our pets.

They were used to breed and that's it - they were never pet, never inside a home, and never knew real love. Due to the environment they grew up in, they are absolutely terrified of people - they will run away from every person they see, and will bite if cornered. Deputy and Tobias are dogs that will need an experienced dog owner with absolute dedication and focus. It will be hard work teaching them how to be normal dogs. The one thing they have going for them is that they are comfortable around other dogs. Maybe being in a home with a goofy, happy dog will help them learn a thing or two?\nDeputy and Tobias do not have to be adopted together. They had never met each other prior to coming to our facility, although they lived in the same \"\"home\"\". \n\nDOB 11-10-2016...All pets have lifetime sanctuary at Haven of the Ozarks. If they cannot remain with their adopter, they must be returned to the Haven.\n\nAdoption fees are as follows: \nPuppies under the age of 6 months - $125\nDogs weighing 30 pounds and less - $125 \nDogs ages 6 months to 5 yrs old - $90\nDogs over the age of 5 yrs old - $75.\nCats under the age of 6 months old - $75\nCats over the age of 6 months old - $65",

            "description": "Brandy is one of Peanut's pups! Peanut was in a loving home before coming to the Haven. She had a litter of pups in her home (Jacky, Brandy, and Tootsie!), where they decided to keep all the dogs. The father to these pups was a golden retriever mix, so the puppies have grown to be rather large dogs! The owners, although they had the best intentions, became overwhelmed with the amount of large dogs in their home. \nBrandy is a very pretty brindle colored golden retiever/rhodesian ridgeback mix. She is shy with strangers, but once she gets comfortable, she is very loving! She is used to being an indoor/outdoor dog, and requires a privacy fence (those long legs let her hop over chainlink fences like they are nothing). Brandy has lived with her siblings all her life and done great with them. She is not very outgoing - she seems to follow the lead of other dogs. She is a very submissive giant who would do great as a playmate for your dog! Brandy is spayed, up to date on shots, microchipped, and has been de-wormed.\nDOB: 10/24/2019...All pets have lifetime sanctuary at Haven of the Ozarks. If they cannot remain with their adopter, they must be returned to the Haven.\n\nAdoption fees are as follows: \nPuppies under the age of 6 months - $125\nDogs weighing 30 pounds and less - $125 \nDogs ages 6 months to 5 yrs old - $90\nDogs over the age of 5 yrs old - $75.\nCats under the age of 6 months old - $75\nCats over the age of 6 months old - $65",

They were used to breed and that's it - they were never pet, never inside a home, and never knew real love. Due to the environment they grew up in, they are absolutely terrified of people - they will run away from every person they see, and will bite if cornered. Deputy and Tobias are dogs that will need an experienced dog owner with absolute dedication and focus. It will be hard work teaching them how to be normal dogs. The one thing they have going for them is that they are comfortable around other dogs. Maybe being in a home with a goofy, happy dog will help them learn a thing or two?\nDeputy and Tobias do not have to be adopted together. They had never met each other prior to coming to our facility, although they lived in the same \"\"home\"\". \n\nDOB 12-25-2014...All pets have lifetime sanctuary at Haven of the Ozarks. If they cannot remain with their adopter, they must be returned to the Haven.\n\nAdoption fees are as follows: \nPuppies under the age of 6 months - $125\nDogs weighing 30 pounds and less - $125 \nDogs ages 6 months to 5 yrs old - $90\nDogs over the age of 5 yrs old - $75.\nCats under the age of 6 months old - $75\nCats over the age of 6 months old - $65",

She is the fetch-it queen and will chase and return the ball 50 times if you let her. She is a lil chunky but has lost some weight since she has been with us. Nova loves to be cuddled and rubbed on. \n\nBlaze is a white long-haired fella. He has a couple of medical issues that are managed easily. Needs Enzyme powder and Cosequin (joint supplement) in the a.m. with food. He is a sweet quiet boy that you don't even notice is there. He lays quietly anywhere. He prefers the backyard doggy deck with a soft bed to lay in the sun until he can't take it anymore and comes trotting in for water ?\n\nThese two deserve a home that will shower them with love and affection.\n\nNova and Blaze are NOT California Pit bull Rescue dogs. They are a courtesy posting for 510 Paws Rescue. Please contact them to receive an application: https://www.facebook.com/510pawsrescue\n",

We will NOT respond to \"is he available\" inquiries. \n\nOreo is a one-year-old Terrier Mix. He\u2019s sweet, social, and loves other dogs. Naturally, he\u2019s curious about everything since indoor life is very new to him. Oreo is very playful and has lots of energy. Before joining our squad, he lived outdoors in a crate covered in plastic. He would roam the streets by day and eventually find his way back home. His owner surrendered him to our care; they no longer had an interest in having him. \n\nHe\u2019s acclimated to his foster home and follows his fellow foster sibling\u2019s regimen. He loves to eat and isn\u2019t a picky eater. He loves playtime and zooming around is his favorite thing to do in the backyard. \n\nOreo will need more training and a family that will continue to help him transition into a domesticated life. He does show separation anxiety when left alone or barricaded behind a gate. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting Oreo please complete an Adoption Interest Application found on our website under \u201cforms.\u201d \n\n*PLEASE READ: Traditionally, we personally respond to each submission received. However, due to the current high volume of applications/adoptions, you will receive an acknowledgment/receipt email of your submission.\n\nBecause we know each of our heroes personally and know the best setting for them to thrive in, we will ONLY contact applications that best match their requisite needs.\n\nWe thank you in advance for your interest to adopt one of our heroes and for your patience through the process.\n\nThank you for choosing to rescue!",

Norm is an excited young man, so he will do best in a home with children over the age of 10. Please note, Norm is very energetic as he is still a young dog. He is looking for a home that will also help him understand his energy. Norm is strong on a leash, but just needs to learn how to walk on a leash and waht a leash means. Norm loves attention and is looking for a home willing to put in the time to make sure he lives his best dog life.\n\nIf you are interested in rescuing Norm - please email us at VegasRootsRescue@gmail.com",

All this girl wanted for Christmas was to live so we decided to pull her from Beaumont Animal Control where her time had run out and she was scheduled for Euthanasia due to the shelter filling up at a alarming rate and being at capacity. This is a bad time of the year for any dog to be in a shelter. This was her second time there and all we can do now is make sure it was the last time.  Peggy is currently in boarding. The boarding facility tells us that she can be protective of her food. She would probably do best as an only dog. She is very sweet and loving with her care takers. She does not mess in her kennel, so we would venture to say that she is housebroken. \nIf you would like to meet this precious girl, please submit an application to www.pupsinperil.org/adoption",

This constantly happy and smiling boy is goofy, funny and constantly entertaining his foster mom. He needs a fenced yard, lots of time to exercise and a strong alpha owner who is the leader of their dog pack if there is more than one dog in the home. He showed up as a stray and the foster mom took him in with a promise to help find him the best home ever. She is working with Critter Cavalry Rescue to do just that.\nA new home where he can lounge on the sofa, in a dog bed, be a part of the family happenings with the people surrounding him, would be heaven on earth for him. Right now he has to stay in a small room away from the jealous foster home's dog. The foster mom is making it work by Shuffling things around. We think that Angus is smart and could even be good at agility training and just plain learning show dog skills and tricks and tasks. He is like a sponge who is eager to learn and to please you. If you are looking for dog to devote himself to your every step in life and To love you to the moon and back, then please consider Happy Angus. This Tasmanian high energy devil on the outside is nothing but a marshmallow on the inside. A total package of everything in a dog.

He has quickly learned much about how to be a good house dog and also how much fun it is to go for walks in heel.\nHe gets along well with female dogs as well as medium and small males. Longfellow will be a playful, loving addition to his future family and will gladly return all the love they can show him.

He\u2019s always got so many compliments on his walks of how gorgeous he is and how well behaved he is. His coat is like a lightly toasted marshmallow, has dreamy brown eyes and a sweet temperament. Hulk is very sweet and affectionate, who is great with other dogs, but not small dogs and cats please. We think he'd be a wonderful family dog or someone's best friend. He's a long lean doggy machine that's 5 years old and has plenty of energy for that active lifestyle you have or would love to have. Hulk was surrendered to the shelter with his sibling for whatever sad excuse owners gave and his sibling got adopted and poor Hulk got passed up and was rescued minutes to be euthanized. He had a home and now he's ready for a real home, a loving home and this time his forever!! \n     He is neutered,  vaccinated,  chipped, and just waiting to hear from his sweet home!",

Thankfully, PPITS was able to get me back!\n\nI am very sweet with people. I am getting the hang of my commands and working on leash manners. I am also working on my dog reactivity and getting lots of structure and discipline. I am potty trained and crate trained. \n\nI love hiking and being active. I would do best with an active person or a couple. If there are children in the home, it would be that they are older (12+). I am still anxious about what happened to me, so I probably would not do well with small children. \n\nOh, and I love to cuddle and can\u2019t wait to snuggle up with my forever family!",

He is a very sweet boy. He has embraced daily walks and gets excited when he sees his leash.  He loves to cuddle and being petted and will nudge your hand for more.\n\nMax will let you know when its meal time as that is his favorite time of the day.\n\nHe does have some medical issues that require daily medications. That will be an additional cost but he is so worth it.\n\nHe sleeps well thru the nite (currently in an open crate). Max gets along well with our female and respects her.  He seems to be fully housetrained (not one accident so far)\n\nMax so deserves his own forever home who will love & care for him-are you that home?\n\nBIO:  Max came from a Shelter in north Georgia. We can\u2019t imagine why anyone would turn him in! In just a few words he\u2019s sweet, friendly, and gets along with all dogs. He does like to beg from the table but we don\u2019t give him people food and no one should.  It's not good for him. Our wish list for Max includes:\n  - A fenced yard is a must\n  - Another dog or two to pal around with\n  - Someone that is home a lot to keep him company because he does love his people\n  - No apartments or high-rises\n\nAfter coming into rescue, Max had his gall bladder removed. He has fully recovered and is doing fine without it!  During his initial vet exam, we also found he has a 4/6 heart murmur but no clinical signs of distress.  He is on two meds to help with the blood flow.\n\nMax loves to cuddle with either you or your dog.  He is one of the easiest fosters we've had.\n\nPlease keep in mind that not only will you have the monthly heartworm prevention but you'll also have Vetmedin and Enalapril to purchase each month.  Sadly, Max also has dry eyes so he'll need artificial tears.\n\nDon\u2019t let any of that scare you off... he is a dream to foster! \n\n============== Information for All Dogs/Adopters ==============\n\nIf you have questions about this dog, please feel free to contact the foster home at the email address listed above.  They have the most up-to-date information concerning the dog and would be happy to answer any questions about the animal. \n\nWe welcome out of state and Canadian adoptions, but we will not ship any dog via cargo.  You will have to make arrangements to pick up the dog or for them to go by ground transport.  If you choose transporting by either volunteers through our organization or by paid transporter, there will be an additional $45 fee added for the required Health Certificate. \n\nWe will not adopt into CT, RI, NH, ME, or MA due to strict laws regarding importation of dogs into those states.  If you have an issue with this, you need to take this up with your legislatures.\n\nTo understand the adoption process through AADR, please review the Adoption Information on our home page.  Transportation options are outlined on that page in Step 3.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this Dachshund please review Read Before You Adopt and then you can complete an Application.\n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN A RESCUE.\n\nPlease don't let the distance stand in your way of finding your newest best friend. We have volunteers that will help your \"new friend\" get up and down the East Coast and MidWest. We just can't get them from one Coast to the other but some day we hope to have enough volunteers to do that as well.  For now, please look for dogs on your coast.\n",

Her greatest joy in life is cuddling with her human & canine companions.  If you're looking for a couch potato who will lay quietly by your side & keep you warm for hours, Cuddles is your girl!  Her history is unknown, but it is clear that she spent much of her life being bred.  She is still learning about life, but has silly puppy antics and an adorable pittie prance.  Cuddles asks that you forgive her sometimes pouty scowl & her mostly serious expression. She wants you to know that her wrinkles and markings do not accurately convey the silly, fun-loving girl she really is.  She is looking for a home with at least one friendly dog she can snuggle with who will help build her confidence as she learns what it\u2019s like to be a loved family member.  She currently lives with three canine friends (two males & one female), but her behavior around cats is unknown.  She is housebroken, crate trained, spayed, fully vaccinated & microchipped. She was HW+ when she came to BarkVille and her treatment will be completed soon.  If you are not familiar with Heartworms, dogs get them from mosquitos and it is not contagious. It is easily prevented & highly treatable, but requires extended rest during treatment.\n\nFor more information about Cuddles, please email us at info@barkvilledogrescue.org. If you would like to adopt this sweet girl, please submit an application for her at https://www.barkvilledogrescue.org/applications",

            "description": "Meet Darla, a sweet and chill gal who found herself homeless and sharing a yard with a fur friend. She was rescued from sleeping under the shed this Christmas after being attacked by some other dogs and needing vet care pretty badly. She is on antibiotics and eye ointment and will have her bum leg evaluated soon, and will be spayed as soon as she is well enough. She is getting along with other dogs and cats and is housetrained and crate trained. Because she is a courtesy post, all applications will be screened and forwarded to the current caregiver. The application is available on the rescue website and can be completed online.We work with many rescues and strive to find every rescued dog in our care a great home. Sometimes that means transferring that pet to another location where adoption may be more likely. We currently have partners in New York, Pennsylvania, and Vermont.\n\nIf you are interesting in meeting any of our pets, the process is to complete an application. It can be downloaded as a pdf document from our website and submitted by email to WindyRidgeRescue@gmail.com as a scanned document or as photos OR can be completed entirely online. Both links are in the header of our website.\n\nBecause we are foster based, we require an approved application to schedule a meet and greet. We feel that is fair to our fosters and rescues so every meet and greet can result in an adoption.\n\nWe do not have set adoption fees for dogs, but hope adopters will donate generously so we can rescue more. The medical care for every dog can easily exceed the adoption donation. Average adoption fees for dogs in the area range from $175 up to $450.\n\nWe ask for a minimum adoption donation of $50 for cats regardless of age. Each cat is up to date on vaccinations, dewormer, and microchipped. Larger donations are always welcome so we can rescue more. Medical care for each cat easily exceeds the minimum donation.\n\nAs with every rescue, our resources are limited and the need for rescue help is unlimited. Your generosity helps us to rescue more.\n\nAdopting or fostering for a rescue frees up a space where a new rescue can reside.\n\nIf you can't adopt or foster, than please consider donating.",

He is a very sweet boy. He has embraced daily walks and gets excited when he sees his leash.  He loves to cuddle and being petted and will nudge your hand for more.\n\nMax will let you know when its meal time as that is his favorite time of the day.\n\nHe does have some medical issues that require daily medications. That will be an additional cost but he is so worth it.\n\nHe sleeps well thru the nite (currently in an open crate). Max gets along well with our female and respects her.  He seems to be fully housetrained (not one accident so far)\n\nMax so deserves his own forever home who will love & care for him-are you that home?\n\nBIO: Max came from a Shelter in north Georgia. We can\u2019t imagine why anyone would turn him in! In just a few words he\u2019s sweet, friendly, and gets along with all dogs. He does like to beg from the table but we don\u2019t give him people food and no one should.  It's not good for him. Our wish list for Max includes:\n  - A fenced yard is a must\n  - Another dog or two to pal around with\n  - Someone that is home a lot to keep him company because he does love his people\n  - No apartments or high-rises\n\nAfter coming into rescue, Max had his gall bladder removed. He has fully recovered and is doing fine without it!  During his initial vet exam, we also found he has a 4/6 heart murmur but no clinical signs of distress.  He is on two meds to help with the blood flow.\n\nMax loves to cuddle with either you or your dog.  He is one of the easiest fosters we've had.\n\nPlease keep in mind that not only will you have the monthly heartworm prevention but you'll also have Vetmedin and Enalapril to purchase each month.  Sadly, Max also has dry eyes so he'll need artificial tears.\n\nDon\u2019t let any of that scare you off... he is a dream to foster! \n\n============== Information for All Dogs/Adopters ==============\n\nIf you have questions about this dog, please feel free to contact the foster home at the email address listed above.  They have the most up-to-date information concerning the dog and would be happy to answer any questions about the animal. \n\nWe welcome out of state and Canadian adoptions, but we will not ship any dog via cargo.  You will have to make arrangements to pick up the dog or for them to go by ground transport.  If you choose transporting by either volunteers through our organization or by paid transporter, there will be an additional $45 fee added for the required Health Certificate. \n\nWe will not adopt into CT, RI, NH, ME, or MA due to strict laws regarding importation of dogs into those states.  If you have an issue with this, you need to take this up with your legislatures.\n\nTo understand the adoption process through AADR, please review the Adoption Information on our home page.  Transportation options are outlined on that page in Step 3.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this Dachshund please review Read Before You Adopt and then you can complete an Application.\n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN A RESCUE.\n\nPlease don't let the distance stand in your way of finding your newest best friend. We have volunteers that will help your \"new friend\" get up and down the East Coast and MidWest. We just can't get them from one Coast to the other but some day we hope to have enough volunteers to do that as well.  For now, please look for dogs on your coast.\n",

This boy loves people so much, we could not allow that to happen! He also did great with the cat at the vets office. Jax is between 1-2 years old and is about 40 pounds. Because Jax is not dog friendly, we will be requiring a single-family dwelling with a fenced and/or private yard. He is fully vetted and ready for his forever family!\n\nJax is arriving to RI on 1/8 and is available for pre-adoption.

He is very good with children, he checks on his foster children every night with his foster mom! He loves to be around you at all times but also loves to cuddle and take a good nap. He also believes that he is about the size of a Chihuahua while sitting on your lap\u2026. He is housebroken and sleeps through the night.\n\nKoda is going to be having surgery next week to have some lumps removed and we have learned that he has colitis, so he will need to be on special food to help manage it. \n\nIf you are interested in Koda, please contact Barbara at BarbaraABoxer@gmail.com\n\nName: Koda\nAge: 9\nDogs: Maybe - Submissive female\nCats: Unknown\nKids: 12+",

            "description": "Jayson Stark is a hunky 3-year-old beefcake who was confiscated from a cruelty situation in Tennessee. Lucky for us (and for him!) a wonderful PFP volunteer flew down to pick up Jayson, his companion Hazel Mae, and their surviving puppies from the shelter. Once Jayson hopped on that plane, he never looked back! \n\nNow he is learning to live in a house with other dogs, but he needs to be on crate rest due to heartworm treatment, so he doesn't get to play as much as he\u2019d like. Happily, he still gets cuddle time on the couch with his foster parents and four-legged foster sisters, and that's enough for him. Thankfully for all involved, Jayson is a doll in his crate and he only whines when he needs to potty or get a drink of water!\n \nJayson has also never met a stranger. Every person he meets, he warms up to immediately and sits by them looking for pets. From hopping on a plane with one stranger to going to a new place with two new people and dogs to snuggle with, Jayson is absolutely fearless! When you first look at him, you will see his handsome strength. Once you get to know him though, you'll notice his floppy feet and the goofy smile that comes out when he gets cuddles! \n\nAnother fun fact: he loves peanut butter bones! He gets one every day in his crate while winding down for the evening, and he definitely knows when it is time for one, because he goes right to his crate to wait for it!\n\nIf you\u2019ve got room in your heart and home for a big lug like Jayson, fill out a survey at https://www.playersforpits.com/adoption-survey. \n",

He loves meeting new people and will do best with dogs his size or larger. Mambo will need a tall fenced yard to run around and tire himself out. He is full of energy and can walk for miles. He will make a great jogging partner or fetching friend for an active owner. He is crate trained and mostly house trained. He LOVES car rides and playing in the snow. \n\nPuppies have special needs and require a home where there will be someone available to care for, socialize, and train them during the day. If your family is away from the home for several hours at a time, please consider adopting a teenager or adult dog.\n\nOur standard adoption fees are as follows $400 for puppies up to 12 months, $300 for adults, and $200 for seniors 7yrs and up with cash or check. It includes spay/neuter, age appropriate vaccinations, fecal testing, deworming, flea and tick preventative, heartworm preventative, free vet visit at one of our participating vets, and micro-chipping.\n\nWe must have an application, conduct a phone interview, and meet your entire family to approve an adoption. Please visit www.rescuedrascalsil.org for an application. \n\nPlease note that the breeds and sizes posted in this biography are educated best guesses and are not guaranteed.",

A playful dog like me will have fun during a game of fetch, of course, but also when quietly chewing on a stuffed toy. Whatever kind of toy I like best, I'll want my new family to play too!\nAll our animals are available for adoption, but some may not be ready to go home just yet.\nPlease call if you have questions on current status. 707.442.1782\n\nIf you are considering adopting from Sequoia Humane Society, filling out a general applicaiton is the first step. It's good for a year, and the oldest general application has first pick, when any animal becomes available for adoption.\n\nVisit us at Sequoia Humane Society or like us on Facebook",

My name is Indy and I\u2019m a three and a half year old Australian Shepherd. I am red Merle in color and weigh about 63 pounds. I have been told that I\u2019m a very handsome boy. I am house trained and crate trained and I love to play. My rescue had me checked out at the vet because one of my rear paws drags a bit when I run or walk. Luckily the vet said it was an old injury that had healed wrong and would not require surgery. It doesn\u2019t hurt me but my new owners should keep an eye on it as I age. This doesn\u2019t limit my activities as I love going on walks and chasing my fur sister around the yard. My foster mom makes sure I walk on the grass so my foot doesn\u2019t get irritated from the concrete sidewalk. We are going to try a boot too and see if I like that. One thing I want to mention is that I am very fearful of strangers and need time to get to know you and trust you. I need someone who will be patient with me and understand my needs. Once we establish a mutual trust, I am a very loyal companion. I am happy laying by your side and will rest my head in your lap for some pats and ear rubs. My ideal home would be a quiet environment with not a lot of people coming and going. I must have a fur sister or brother as I love other dogs and need them to build my confidence. I am being fostered in Allen, Texas and would love to meet you soon!! \nAdoption Fee: $350\nApplication REQUIRED!\nwww.H3Rdfw.org",

He is NOT aggressive at all, he just has trauma in his past and is initially afraid of human touch. A fenced yard would be preferred, but not required.\nBo likes to have a safe place with a warm soft bed. He is very tolerant of anything that needs to be done with him, but will walk away when needing to go pick him up. He LOVES other little dogs and has recently started to take interest in bones and toys. He is not potty trained, but will go potty quickly when going outside in fenced yard. He does not do any leg lift marking and typically waits until he is taken outside to potty. He sleeps in a pen vs. a kennel and enjoys spending time in his pen. As time goes by, he has been navigating around the house with more confidence. \nBo has an old femoral neck injury that causes decreased mobility in his back leg and probable arthritis. He can walk on all four legs, but does lift his back leg up at times. His bloodwork was good and his vet work is complete. \nIf you meet his needs and are interested in adopting Bo, you can submit an application at www.heartrescueteam.com",

I'm sure I can adjust quickly to changes and a new environment. If your household is somewhat busier and more active, I might just be the right dog! A sociable dog like me usually gets along well with other pets too.\nAll our animals are available for adoption, but some may not be ready to go home just yet.\nPlease call if you have questions on current status. 707.442.1782\n\nIf you are considering adopting from Sequoia Humane Society, filling out a general applicaiton is the first step. It's good for a year, and the oldest general application has first pick, when any animal becomes available for adoption.\n\nVisit us at Sequoia Humane Society or like us on Facebook",

One day he hopped into a local gentleman's car and was subsequently surrendered to ABR. In ABR's care he had a large, painful growth, the result if a botched dew claw removal, excised from his paw. Rollie was also diagnosed with a perianal fistula, an ongoing medical condition that requires constant care and pricey daily meds. He is blessed to have a retired nurse as his forever foster.",

She was a great human mom to me. Unfortunately she had to move to her sisters place and her sister doesn't have a fence to keep me contained, she lives in the country without fences. So my human did what she had to do, which was bringing me here to Delta Humane Society & SPCA of San Joaquin County. The staff here are taking good care of me and they are going to make sure I find a forever family for me in no time at all. So call the shelter to make an appointment for a meet and greet with me.",

We were surrendered due to NO TIME. We're very sweet, loving & friendly to all and we make quite the adorable odd couple! We're good with other dogs and cats but have never lived with kids but I'm sure we'd be fine with older kids ages 7 yrs+. We need a home with folks that are going to spend time with us and not leave us alone for hours on end. We deserve to be adored and spoiled and want to live our best lives.... if you want a DYNAMIC DUO... look no further!! \n\nFor more info/application - please email: INFO@TAILSOFLOVERESCUE.ORG",

I'm Peter Pan, my story begins when I was sent away to Neverland (the shelter) it was a scary awful place but luckily I was rescued and taken out of that place. After spending time on the other side I became fearful and really unsure of people and afraid that they would send me back to that awful place. I tried to be as scary as I could in hopes people would keep their distance. I LOVED my foster family though! Apparently what I was doing wasn't proper puppy behavior so I was sent to this AMAZING guy who helped me trust people. We have played, laughed, cuddled and played some more. Apparently we did something called \"training\" too but I don't know what that is. I have learned some amazing things like sit, stay, come and how to walk on a leash; apparently pulling is frowned upon, who knew. I'm now looking for my forever family. One that will take me on awesome adventures exploring this amazing land, no terrain is too hard for Peter Pan! I sometimes like to be bossy, it's in my DNA - what can I say? I really need a person who will be a strong leader and keep me in line. I like small children from afar but not up close, I like my kids to be older. I have not been officially cat tested but I'm sure that I would be way too interested in them, therefore a home with cats would not be a good fit for me. I would really like to end my story with a happily ever after... could it be with you?\n\nIf you are interested in giving Peter Pan the home that he needs and deserves, please fill out an adoption application at lastdaydogs.com\n\nNote: While Basenji's are known to be barkless and hypoallergenic, Peter Pan is not.",

            "description": "This is Gunther, a 3 year old Chihuahua mix.\nHe is new to our rescue so we are still working on his potty training.\nHe is good in a crate and he gets along with other dogs.\nHe likes his buddies to leave his food alone so he should be fed separately from other animals. Many dogs who have been out on their own have what we call food aggression. \nHe is a cute little bugger, and not a barker.\n\nHe looks like he could be what we call a Chi-Weenie. Looks like he weighs about 15 pounds. Very jaunty.\n\nFilling out an application is the first step in the adoption process. If you have questions, the best way to contact us is to email azdesertrottis@aol.com.\n\nWe don't always bring all animals to our adoption events so check ahead of time to make sure the animal you are interested in is still available. Some animals listed may already be promised.\n\nArizona Desert Rotti & Pals Rescue is a NO KILL rescue serving Tucson and the surrounding area. \n\nWe do adopt out of area under the right circumstances. If you are willing to travel to Tucson to meet us, and to personally transport your adopted pet home, we may be willing to work with you. \n\nA home visit is usually required for the safety of our animals. We check the yard to make sure this little pup cannot escape, no predator can get in, and also look for hazardous plants. \n\nWe do not adopt our dogs out unless you have a fenced yard, it\u2019s a requirement for the safety of the dog. At the end of the application, please include the type of fencing and the height of the fence you have around your yard. \n\nIf you're interested in Saxon or any of our dogs, please fill out a pre application at: http://www.azdesertrotti.com/html/to_adopt.htm\nOnce you have filled out the pre-adoption application, someone will contact you about the dog to answer your questions and tell you where our Sunday adoption event is held.\n\nOur dogs are bathed, dewormed, vet checked, given their required shots, spayed or neutered, and microchipped. \n\nOur rescues are homed with foster parents. They are fostered in homes so that we can tell you a little bit about their personalities, feeding schedule, habits, behavior, whether they get along with other dogs. We can tell you if they are crate trained, if they are leash trained and house trained. Most dogs need a refresher course on potty training when they go to a new home. They need to learn your routine, and it will be up to you to teach them. \n\nEven the most abused animals can be wonderful pets. It takes patience, love and good food, along with fun and commitment to the animal. Fosters work with these animals. They are a part of our families, while we are lucky enough to have them.",

This does not happen overnight, no. It took months to get this point; to where poor Macho is now in such shockingly ghastly condition. But he has suffered, each and every step of the way. It is unacceptable, and to be quite honest, downright appalling \u2013 regardless of just what underlying condition(s) he may be up against. Macho's condition is completely and wholly unacceptable. \n\nMacho is a senior gentlemen, who has lived with one family, and one family alone \u2013 his entire life. He has looked up to \u2013 and relied on \u2013 a select few people, who he believed truly cared for him. But then, Macho found himself on the side of the road, alone. He was a little man in a very big world; scared, and undoubtedly confused. Where was his family? Where were his humans? Did he do something bad - something that maybe changed their minds about him?\n\nNo matter how you slice his cake, this baby boy's outcome was not fair. And it definitely wasn't right. Macho is loyal; Macho loves unconditionally. But despite giving his humans all he had to give (and then some), this beautiful soul found himself very scared, and very alone. He couldn't figure out what he'd done to deserve this. \u2013 He didn\u2019t mean to grow old. But thankfully, however, Macho's fate changed, when Rusty Rover Canine Rescue came across his photo on a local shelter's website. And immediately, they knew he needed out.  We knew we were his only chance at a second chance. We knew there was so much more going on with this little guy and he needed our help. \n\nNow, Macho SAFE with rescuers of Rusty Rover Canine Rescue. But the neglect this poor boy has faced is overwhelmingly blatant; he is terrified, and so, so weak. He is severely emaciated, down to nothing but skin and bones. And most recently, diagnostic tests have revealed this poor boy is Diabetic \u2013 which, up until this point, has not been regulated by any means. And to add to his ever-growing list \u2013 poor Macho has also developed an aggressive form of dental disease; he suffers from a heart murmur; he has cataracts and visual impairments in his eyes; and he is so, so emaciated. Macho is - to put it bluntly - utterly and wholly heartbreaking. \n\nMacho needs follow up with a regular vet to get his diabetes regulated; and beyond this, Macho needs help with lifelong management. (Insulin injections twice a day, along with regular glucose checks to make sure his insulin is working correctly, and also a special diet). He also needs internal medicine and cardiology consultations as he at be hypothyroid and has a heart murmur. This little guy has been through the wringer. He has a long road to recovery ahead of him, but thankfully, he is now in the best hands capable of taking on the task. Rescuers are committed and ready for the long haul \u2013 because they know, and we know, that Macho more than deserves the medical and emotional help he needs to get back on all four paws. \n\nPlease keep this special boy in your thoughts and prayers, and if you are able to assist with Macho's care, please consider donating to this fundraiser. If you can, please consider donating to support this baby's ongoing care today and help give him the second chance he deserves; any donation, no matter the size, means the world to both rescuers, and to Macho. \u2013 Because together, we can all make sure we get more of Macho to love! Thank you all, for your kindness and support!",

            "description": "**Please read thoroughly before applying to adopt Cooper**\n\nCooper is a young guy who is full of spunk! It is clear that he did not have any training of any kind before he came to Adopt A Husky and was quite the wild child. He did not know how to play with other dogs, although he wanted to, and he was so jumpy and mouthy that it was hard for people to work with him. Thankfully, we were able to call in the professionals, and he got to go to school at Bark University! He has now learned how to play appropriately with other dogs and has learned a bit of impulse control. He is incredibly sweet and loving, gentle with adults, and has learned how to relax when it is time to do so - as long as he has had some exercise.\n\nCooper has come a long way with his training, but he still gets a bit mouthy and jumpy at times. When he gets overstimulated or overexcited, he may forget his manners. He will not do well on a tie-out, so any fence must be 6-feet high. He will sail right over anything lower. He is super smart and seeks adventure, so he will need constant supervision when outside.\n\nCooper's perfect home does not have kids under age 13, has at least one adult who will keep him active with lots of walks, running, biking, or participating in dog powered sports. He also needs humans who understand that his training needs to be worked on daily and will give him treats for being a good boy - he will work for food! Cooper would love another young, active dog in the home to play with as long as they like to play rough and play, play, play! He is not dominant or bossy, and takes corrections well from other dogs, but would be way too much for a senior dog or a small dog.\n\nCooper would prefer to continue working with his trainers at Bark University in Mundelein, Illinois and would love to continue going to daycare regularly. We will require his adopters to complete at least a few training sessions at Bark University, so you need to live close to Mundelein, and continue training with a positive reinforcement trainer.\n\nIf you have Siberian experience and are looking for an active boy to keep you on your toes, apply for Cooper now!",

The ideal fence is a 6 ft wood fence which she has in her foster home. Goldie chases cats, so not cats in the home please. she has never lived with children so any kids should be 12 and older.

She's never been around small children. She's a big player and loves to have fun. She needs a tall, wood privacy fenced yard at her home. Penny needs a sweet, male dog her size or bigger to live with. She does best with sweet natured, non dominant male dogs who play but aren't too hyper or too wild. We do not want her to be the only dog, and it must be the right match for Penny. Penny loves to cuddle and give kisses. She's extremely smart and a fast learner. She's housebroken, crate-trained, spayed and current on shots.\nWe do NOT adopt out our pitbulls to homes who already have a pitbull or mix. One bully per household please.\nMetro Atlanta Adoptions only ~ No apartments please.",

We cannot email back those who do not meet these requirements.\n1)Pickles must have a fenced yard. 2)Pickles must have another small, playful dog his size in the home. If you don't have another dog and are open to two dogs, we have his best friend Sophie for adoption, also on our site.3)Pickles must have someone who is home during the day...either works from home, stay at home mom or retired. 4)Adoptive Home must be in Atlanta area, no exceptions. 5)Pickles needs an owner who has raised and house trained a dog. He is not completely housebroken and needs someone home often and with experience training a dog.\nPickles is a 1 year old male, chihuahua/rat terrier mix, about 15 lbs. He's sweet, loving and playful. He has a lot of love to give. He's never been around kids, only kids over 13 please.\nHe currently lives at a boarding kennel for dogs until adopted. He's outgoing but can be shy with strangers, but he does get used to them quickly. Anyone meeting him will need to be patient and understand and he will acclimate fairly soon but going to a home with new people will be quite the adjustment. With time, love and patience he will do great.",

She's laid back for her age and just likes to chill at home with her people. Daisy loves her toys and bones and overall, just wants to be loved and to snuggle. Her main requirement is that she is the only pet in the home.\nDaisy is completely housebroken, crate trained and wonderful in the house. She does best having a fenced yard to go outside to do her business. Dogs have started spats with her in her foster home causing her to be insecure around dogs. She's happiest when she feels safe and secure and that's when she's the only pet. Kids 12 and older are best as Daisy has never lived with small children. Daisy is vaccinated, spayed and microchipped too. She currently weighs around 55 lbs.",

We will not make exceptions.\n\n- Tyler must be the only pet in the home.\n- Tyler needs a tall wood 6ft privacy fence, no short chain link fences 4 ft tall\n\n- No children in the home, if kids visit it must not be often as Tyler is not used to kids and was previously abused and has trust issues. Tyler is a beautiful dog, but PLEASE don't inquire because he's handsome.\n\n- He needs a person very experienced with dogs!!!\n\n- Tyler does best with women and has only lived with women. He's met 2 men ever in his life that he trusted. He will not be adopted to a home with only a man, there must be a woman in the home.\n\n- Age range for adopter is 40-60. No older, no younger please. He's still an active dog and we doing our best to match his energy level with the right person.\n\nTyler is a darling boy but a very special dog with specific needs. Please read his description and only inquire if you meet the requirements below and are serious about helping a dog with special needs and behavior issues.\n\nTyler is a 6 year old, male, Terrier/Poodle mix, and weighs around 30 lbs. He's a gorgeous boy and is very loving once he gets to know and trust you. Tyler needs extra time to get used to new people and will do best after a few introductions. He was very scared when we first got him and he didn't trust anyone. A trainer said he was previously abused which makes sense why it takes time for him to become comfortable with new people.\n\nHe loves our volunteers, who he knows and trusts. He needs a calm, loving person and home, and someone with a lot of dog experience. He doesn't like strangers coming up to him until he gets to know them well. He must have the right adopter and right home for this to work out. He will do best in a very calm, quiet home with someone who will be patient until he comes out of his shell. An apartment will not work. Not a home with much company or out of town visitors either. Preferably a one or two person home with no children or grandchildren. Tyler is not used to small kids at all.\nIf someone will give him a chance, they will be very happy they did. He's one of the most loving dogs ever and even likes to give hugs around your neck!\nTyler loves to play with toys and to go for walks and especially likes to hang out on the sofa. He rides great in the car also. He must be the only pet in the home. Other animals who get too close really seems to bother him. He has never been around children and given that he's nervous with new people at first, kids will not be suitable for him. The most important thing is a calm, quiet home with one or two people, preferably someone a little older and more settled. Young adults, out of college, engaged or who will have children in the future won't be the right match for Tyler. He's still very active so we'd like someone in the 40-60 year old age range.\n\nIn order for Tyler to get used to someone new, it will take several introductions.\nWe've had dogs like Tyler in the past and when we take things slow, they work out beautifully for the dog and for the adopter.\n\nOnly local adopters/Metro Atlanta only - No Exceptions",

If you don't have another dog and are open to two dogs, we have her best friend Pickles for adoption, also on our site.3)Sophie must have someone who is home during the day...either works from home, stay at home mom or retired. 4)Adoptive Home must be in Atlanta area, no exceptions. 5)Sophie needs an owner who has raised and house trained a dog, she is not completely housebroken and needs someone home often and with experience training a dog.\nSophie is 1-2 year old female Chihuahua mixed possibly with rat terrier. She's both adorable and outgoing. This darling girl was living in a filthy pen outside and finally rescued out of that depressing situation and is very grateful!\nSophie is currently at a boarding kennel until she's adopted. She is not completely house trained and must have an owner who's home during the day and who has plenty of experience house training a dog.\nSophie is very loving and very playful. She loves to be held, loves to carry her toys around and of course loves playing! She's spayed and current on vaccines and a healthy girl.\nNo older, senior dogs and no big dogs please.\nWe do not adopt out of state. Atlanta adoptions only.",

She's a perfect size, only 35 lbs, full grown with a gorgeous caramel coat.\nGinger is a sweet, very spunky girl who's still very active but also has moments of being calm and laid back. Although she's an inside dog, Ginger loves having a fenced yard where she can relax in the sun and run around safely in. She's strong on leash for her size. An active owner is best, and a person who has owned and raised dogs. Ginger is a sweet girl but can be stubborn at times. She doesn't like you to grab her collar until she's very familiar with you and has gained trust. She's good when she meets strangers, but can get very scared at the vet when she has to get shots and her nails clipped. Someone who's owned multiple dogs in the past and preferably someone who's even owned a dog with behavior issues would be a good match for Ginger.\nShe likes running around outside with other dogs and loves going for walks. She loves people, plays well with other dogs, but doesn't care for overly hyper dogs who jump on her.\nShe's never lived with small children, so a home with kids at least 12 and up would be best. Ginger is also housebroken, spayed, current on shots.",

She gets along with other dogs but does have issues with resource guarding so she needs to be given her toys, bones and food separately. She's a sweet dog that just needs love and training. \nShe has been to adoption events and did well.  She was confiscated by MCAA (along with several others) on an abuse/neglect case. Dumpling is fully vetted and hw +. She has completed 30 days of doxy and is ready for treatment but needs a forever home to rest in for about 3 mos through treatment.   Adopter must be able to get to our vet in Elmont NY for treatment.   \n\nIf interested in helping please email kobemnstr@hotmail.com",

            "description": "Because we are all volunteers, Illinois Doberman Rescue Plus only considers approved applicants to meet our orphans in our foster homes. Please read our eligibility requirements and apply on our website: www.ildoberescue.com/adopt. After an application is submitted, additional inquiries can email PlusDogs@ILDobeRescue.com. Our adoption radius is 3 hours from the Chicagoland area.\n\nEnzoe is a 6-month-old (born around June) Heinz 57, which means he might have all sorts of breeds mixed in him. At 30 pounds now, he may weigh more than 75 lbs when full-grown. Our resident breed expert sees some possible Australian Shepherd and Rottie, but we make no guarantees. Enzoe was purchased from a rural flea market and then surrendered to a shelter when the family had second thoughts about getting a puppy. He\u2019s safe in an IDR+ foster home, and his foster mom says that he is a pretty well-behaved puppy, considering his age. He is catching onto housebreaking. Enzoe is full of playful energy! He is a happy guy who would love to have a playmate, but the resident dogs and cats in his foster home don\u2019t share his enthusiasm despite his friendly invitation. He can live with a dog-savvy cat and willing doggie friends. Enzoe has learned to sit for petting instead of jumping, but he sometimes gets excited and forgets. Small kids may not appreciate his excitement, so homes with kids 7 and up can be considered. If there are children in the home, he will require a fenced yard (no e-fence). He will also require an obedience commitment to ensure his success.\n\nThe biographical information provided is correct to the best of our knowledge while the animal is in our care or includes what may have been provided by a previous owner. We strive to be honest and accurate, but animals can change their personalities and behavior when they settle into a new home. IDR+ makes no guarantees based on the information we observe and provide.",

I am a catahoula that is about 5 years old and I weigh 54 pounds. I came to the rescue after a nice lady stopped and helped me. See, I was just sitting beside the road waiting but they never came. She tried to find them but when she couldn't so I came to the rescue. I was adopted for over three years and recently returned because my person went to heaven. I need you to be my new family.I can be quiet, easy going girl sometimes but I love to run and play too. I am kind and loving to children and I want to protect my family. Nothing really upsets me unless someone tries to bother the family but I could never see myself hunting or anything like that. I am a house pet and live inside with you. Consider me a companion for you and the family. I know how to sit, stay, walk on a leash and I am crate & house trained too. I still forget what I am doing and jump up on you sometimes. I did have an accident years ago and caught my chest on a fence (no more four foot fences for me), they sewed it back closed but I have some extra skin that is hanging down. It doesn't bother me so I hope you feel the same about it. I really want to run and play with other dogs my size or maybe you want to give me extra attention.I have been spay, vaccinated and microchipped. My adoption fee is 150.00 and you can start the process by completing an application at www.dogsasfamily.org. I like you already.",

APPLICATIONS CAN BE FILLED OUT AT WWW.SOHODOGRESCUE.ORG.\n\nAvailable!!\nBatman is a sweet, energetic Sheltie / Border Collie mix who is ready for this forever home. He is 5 years old and has a long black and white coat with adorable panda markings on his face. He weighs about 52 lbs but should be about 45 - lots of walks and hiking will take care of that! Batman is house trained, crate trained, knows some obedience commands and is highly treat motivated! He likes to ride in the car and is learning to walk well on the leash.\u2019\n\nBatman loves people! He is a pretty high Velcro guy who wants to be with his people constantly. He loves being a part of the \u201caction\u201d... even if the \u201caction\u201d is just playing with a toy while you work at home. He enjoys long walks and hikes, and likes the company of other dogs so far though he gets so excited when he meets them that we have to remind him to take it easy. He was an \u201conly child\u201d prior to coming to us so is still learning to share and tends to resource-guard his food. He loves toys and will play by himself with them too - he is quite gentle and non-destructive with them. He has not been cat tested.\n\nThe ideal home for this funny, handsome guy is a family who will make him a part of the action and make this sweet pup the center of attention. He does not do well around small children, so children above the age of 12 are required. He really loves to be with his people and prefers a calmer home with lots of exercise, and does just fine walking on a leash (though he is still learning his manners). He does have some skin irritation that is currently doing much better with a commonly available, limited ingredient diet. Another dog would be okay though isn\u2019t required. He loves to walk and run so an active person that wants a dog to join them is key, as well as someone who wants to do some training with this guy because he LOVES to learn. If Batman sounds like he was made for your home, please apply today! Batman is fostered in Washington, D.C.",

            "description": "I AM ON HOLD PENDING AN ADOPTION APPOINTMENT. Gabby is a lovely 1-year-old mixed-breed girl who currently weighs about 60 pounds. She came to SFAS from a partnering shelter. She came in with 2 gun shot wounds to her legs but our ace medical team fixed her up and she is healing nicely. Here at the shelter, Gabby has been very friendly and sweet with staff. She loves affection and cant wait to find a home of her own. Gabby's adoption fee is $130. She is spayed and microchipped and has age-appropriate vaccinations. A licensing/microchip fee may apply. To meet Gabby or to be added to her waitlist, call (505) 983-4309 x 1610 and leave a voicemail message that includes the DOG'S NAME, plus YOUR NAME and A GOOD PHONE NUMBER - OR e-mail this information to adoption@sfhumanesociety.org. A scheduler will call you back within 48 hours to confirm your request. If you have other dogs at home, tell the scheduler you would like to bring them along for a Meet n' Greet. SFAS offers a variety of excellent training classes, seminars and Trainer Talks led by animal behavior professionals. These are $50 off for animals adopted from any shelter or rescue group! Due to current COVID-19 restrictions, classes and talks are all presented virtually using Zoom. For course descriptions, schedules and registration, visit https://sfhumanesociety.org/our-programs/behavior-training/group-training-classes/ for classes and https://sfhumanesociety.org/our-programs/behavior-training/special-seminars-and-workshops/ for seminars and Trainer Talks.",

She was a nice woman trying to help save the dogs but unfortunately she was unable to properly care for them. With the help of her grandson she surrendered Lewis and Clark to us. They are timid and shy but loving boys. It does take some time for them to want to come up to you or meet new fur kids but they are friendly with other dogs once they are given a chance. \n\n \n\nWe are a foster based rescue based out of Muskegon, MI. We have an application process for adopting our pets. We have an application on our website www.caninesrescue.com. PLEASE DO NOT EMAIL US WITH YOUR APPLICATION INFORMATION. WE REQUIRE YOU FILL OUT THE FORM. We check vet references, backgrounds for abuse or neglect and home ownership or speak to the landlord to verify you are allowed to have a pet. Once the application is received and approved then we will set up a time for you to come and meet our pups that are available. All our dogs are up to date on shots, microchipped, been dewormed at least once, and sterilized. All meet and greets are APPOINTMENT ONLY.

I am just your average Coonhound who loves to use my sniffer to hunt and find new things! I am quite the goofball who not only has lots of energy, but equally loves to snuggle up for a good nap! My foster mom says I am extra cute when I am taking a snooze!\nI have been told I am very smart! I am learning new things in my foster home such as commands like sit; tasty treats certainly help motivate me to learn! I am still working on my house training skills, but I think with enough patience along with a good routine, Ill be a master at that in no time! I also do very well in my crate and will sleep in my crate throughout the night. I am also getting really good at walking on a leash and would love a walking/running companion of my very own! I get along with other dogs very well and enjoy a good play session! I am still learning which toys belong to me and will need a family to teach me what a true chew toy is all about; perhaps a good furry sibling role model will help teach me the ways\nI will require an active family who is ready to give me all the love including lots of walks and/or runs around the neighborhood. I will also require a fenced in backyard that is tall and sturdy allowing me to run around and safely chase those neighborhood squirrels!\n\nI have met kitty cats and have gotten very excited around them and think I will do well with them over time.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting the goofy June Boy, apply to adopt at www.causeforcanines.org Adoption fee: $250\nChildren must be 5 years old or older\nMust be an Ohio resident 25 years old or older",

Meet Rover, some of you might remember his previous information about how bad of shape he was in when we got him back. As you can see hes looking great now. Hes gained weight and his hair is back. Rover cant seem to catch a break though from his past, as he is heartworm positive (hes undergoing treatment), has hip dysplasia, and he has neuropathy in his front leg. With all that though comes the most upbeat sweetest dog youll find around. Rover loves other dogs, kids, adults, and even doesnt mind dog savvy cats. We are looking for a special home for Rover. He will need to be continued on his joint supplement for life, and further down the road might require more medical. He deserves to be in a home living the good life. Rover still needs to get his exercise to keep his front leg strengthened, but not over do it. He tries his best to keep his kennel clean, so we believe hell easily catch on to being housebroken. \n\nKeep up with us, our events, our adoptable animals, etc on our Facebook page under Mollys Mutts Animal Rescue! You can also view our adoptable pets on https://www.petstablished.com/organization/95250 Follow us on Instagram and Twitter under mollysmuttsanimalrescue \nPlease call us at 270-318-4177, email us mollysmuttsanimalrescue@yahoo.com or private message us with questions!",

He was picked up as a stray, but we think he once had a family because he knows how to sit and shake and is very well behaved.  \nHe is heartworm positive but has already started treatment! We are working on his house training and he's doing great. He has also picked up on the kennel training quite fast. \nHe gets along great with the other three dogs at his foster\u2019s home! He LOVES LOVES to be outside. He walks well on a leash and enjoys his twice daily walks. He is about 40lbs and would make a great addition to anyone's family.\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our puppies live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\n If you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, the first step is to please visit our website to complete an application and read all of our FAQs: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/adopt \n\n**An inquiry/question on Petfinder is NOT an application. All known details about our animals are posted on their profile and updated daily. Other info would be discussed in detail with the foster during the application review process. Due to the number of inquires received (hundreds daily) we ask you submit an application on our website (a single application can be used for any dog with Take Paws Rescue).\n\nThe adoption fee for adult dogs covers age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, spay/neuter if not yet performed, heartworm test & appropriate heartworm treatment by the rescue's vet. All dogs in our care are also kept up-to-date on HW/Flea Prevention. Please see our website for more information. \n\n2020 Adoption Fee Scale for non-benefactor animals:\nPuppies under 12 months - $300\nDogs over 12 months - $200\n\nFor additional information, including the adoption process and our adoption fee scale for all our adoptable pets, see our FAQs page: https://www.takepawsrescue.org/faq",

Hunter is initially shy and nervous around new people, loud noises and sudden movements but he so wants to part of the group. At this time he is scared to go for walks on leash but give him time. He is good with other small dogs who show him that things that scare him, are really safe. He is really sweet natured and is really full of young dog energy and playfulness. Hunter has been neutered and is current with his vaccinations. At this time, he is best with another friendly dog he can play with and who can show him \"the ropes\" and a family with the patience to let Hunter get to know them slowly!! He is a doll and so worth the effort! Is yours the family for Hunter?\n\nPlease note:\n- Hunter would do best as an only child\n- Hunter is shy and needs a quiet home\n- Hunter is nervous around men\n- Needs a securely fenced yard\n\nFor more information or to apply for Hunter, please go to:\nhttp://www.companionsinwaiting.org/iams/../adopt/dog.php?id=1610\n\n[id=1610;ts=1612303240;src=pf]",

Maggy is a very loving dog, and will enjoy lots of snuggle time.\n\nAmazing Grace Bully Rescue is a foster based rescue in the Pensacola, Florida area. We do not have a physical building. If you would like to meet any of our pups, the first step is to fill out our online application so we can contact you.\n\nOur adoption fee for Maggy is $200 and includes her spay, current shots, rabies vaccine, and a registered microchip.\n\nIf you would like to adopt this Amazing dog, please fill out our online adoption application at www.amazinggracebullyrescue.org\n\nIf you have any questions, please text your question to 723-2037.

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Donner was found locally as a stray and appears to have had a rough past, but that is all behind him now!\n\nDonner is one of the sweetest, most affectionate dogs ever. He is good with all of his basic commands, is housebroken and crate trained. He loves to be wherever his people are and if it's on the couch he will snuggle right up. He also enjoys being outside and going for walks. He is strong but improving his leash manners with every walk. Donner is good with other dogs but may annoy an older dog with his curiosity and antics. He does show some toy guarding behaviors so we recommend kids 8+ in his furever home.\n\nIf this big teddy bear is the dog for you please fill out an adoption application to welcome him into your home!\n\nAdoption donation includes Spay/Neuter, UTD on Vaccinations, deworming, and flea treatment.",

            "description": "Meet Roxy!\n\nRoxy is 8 years old and weighs 60 lbs. She is definitely the most affectionate girl, who loves being around her people. Roxy loves her smaller, foster sister dog and knows how to share toys while still being nice. She isn't a big fan of larger dogs, but would do well with others her size and smaller. She absolutely loves getting pets and affection any chance she can get. Roxy sleeps soundly in her crate through the night, it is her safe space where she unwinds after a long day. She loves being in the presence of her family, so she would prefer it if you gave her a little corner in your bedroom to spend the night. Roxy's day begins with potty time and a bit of exercise around the yard. Breakfast time is her favorite, (who doesn't love food?) and she will patiently sit and wait for you to prep her bowl, however, she is still working on the sitting part. She is super gentle when taking food off your fingers such as training treats or a tasty piece of dog biscuits. Roxy will be a great companion for someone who likes to enjoy life's quiet moments. When her foster parents are relaxing on the couch, Roxy loves to lay on a soft blanket and nap next to them. She is uninterested in having feline friends, so it would be best to stick to canine or human brothers and/or sisters. Roxy is very respectful of everything inside the home and is not interested in chewing anything up, making her the perfect inside dog. Because of her age, Roxy tends to walk a little slower than younger dogs, but that doesn't mean she won't enjoy a nice walk in the park with her family, and she's great on a leash! She's the perfect representation of a gentle dog and deserves to be spoiled through her best years in a loving home!\n\nAlbert's Dog Lounge is a transporting dog rescue, meaning that we rescue many of our dogs from high kill shelters in areas of dog overpopulation. We are a specialty rescue focusing primarily on senior and special needs dogs.  The vast majority of our dogs come from the Houston, TX area where we have an entire team of volunteers, coordinators, and fosters. We do also work with local shelters, rescues, and owners.  If you apply for a dog that is currently in our local Houston program, we will work to get your dog transported to WI as quickly as possible. We ask that you have patience during this time of uncertainty and unprecedented dog adoptions nationwide. \n\nLearn more about Albert's Dog Lounge, our mission, and adoption policies by visiting Albertsdoglounge.org. \n\nOur process includes an approved application, reference checks, a homevisit, and then a meet and greet with the dog. Adoption fee is $275.\n\nBegin your application process by copying this link into your web browser: https://www.albertsdoglounge.org/apply\n\nWI Dept. Of Agriculture License Number: 474085-DS",

He knows all basic commands and is well mannered.  Sharkey loves his belly rubs and pets.  Sharkey does have some allergies and tends to bite and lick causing sores or missing patches of skin. He needs a medicated bath 2-3 x week. Medicated spray on sore patches as well as benadryl a few times a day.  ?He loves to play ball and tends to keep it when you think you're playing fetch.?Sharkey will go to everyone, adults and children alike. He will bark if he sees a stranger in the yard and can be very protective of his family. \n\nHunter is the opposite of Sharkey. He is hyper and happy all the time.? Hunter was a rescue and he is timid when people come over. You have to leave him alone and give him time so he knows you're okay, then he warms up.  He is very protective of his family and will let you know if something doesn't feel right to him. Hunter loves when you pet him and belly rubs are his absolute favorite. He loves to give kisses and be affectionate. ?Hunter loves to play with all of his toys, and takes them all out of the toy box.? He knows all the basic commands and is house trained.\n\nBoth boys are extremely loving and truly love one another.  We really want to keep them together.  Both are neutered and up to date on vaccines.  For additional info or to meet them, please text 702-239-7986.  MUST HAVE EXSPERIENCE",

She's an unusual mix of hound and some bully breed.\n\nShe is very playful and sweet, and loves to be hugged. She's good with other dogs, good on a leash, is outgoing and confident. She was found as a stray in NC. She appears to be around 3 years old and weighs 40 lbs. She is heartworm negative, and is young and healthy. She's a beautiful tricolor, with mostly white face and longish ears and wide muzzle, what a nice combination. Please email Dee at k9rescueva@gmail.com to schedule a meeting with Diva.\n\n**BECAUSE OF OUR REQUIREMENT FOR A HOME VISIT, WE ARE ONLY ABLE TO ADOPT TO HOMES IN THE NORTHERN VA / MARYLAND / DC METRO AREA**\n\nWe have adoption events EVERY SATURDAY from 12-3 p.m. Please note that not all dogs can attend every event, so if you are interested in meeting a particular dog, please complete a no-obligation application on our website at http://www.muttloverescue.org/application.html OR write to adopt@muttloverescue.org.\n\nUpcoming adoption events:\n\nMutt Love Rescue is doing everything we can to ensure the health and safety of our volunteers and adopters while continuing our mission to find homes for as many dogs as possible.\n\nEffective immediately, we will not be holding our weekly adoption events. Dogs available for adoption can be met by appointment only. Potential adopters should submit an online application at http://muttloverescue.org/application.html. Once we receive your application, we will contact you to let you know the next steps.\n\nWe are always desperate for foster homes, now more than ever. If you are interested in fostering during this difficult time, please complete an application... unless you are a previous adopter/foster, then you can just contact us via phone (703-988-2608) or email (adopt@muttloverescue.org) to tell us which dog you want to foster!\n\nFor information on sponsoring this dog, please write to adopt@muttloverescue.org.\n\nWE NEED FOSTER HOMES! FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE EMAIL ADOPT@MUTTLOVERESCUE.ORG.\n\nVisit us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/muttloverescue\nFollow us on Twitter: @Muttlove_Rescue",

If you are the right home for this big boy contact us today!\n\nFelix arrived with a crooked left front leg that had an old fracture of the bones, he had surgery the beginning of November and has healed well even with his puppy-like energy. It takes 8-12 weeks for bones to fully heal, so for the next few weeks we would like him to remain on leash walks with a slow increase in activity and then he is free to run, and play as normal.\n\nMedical: Left radius/ulna bone fracture - chronic, fixed with bone plate, healing well",

I love going for car rides, hanging out with the other dogs, and supervising the cat. Speaking of cats, I am curious about him and will chase him if he runs, but my interest is harmless. He's just really, really interesting. There is a teenager in my foster home. She mostly stays in her bedroom doing teenager-y things, but I like hanging out with her when she emerges. I would be fine with kids of any age. My foster parents work from home, which is great because I have a bit of separation anxiety. My foster mom says that my foster dad is welcome to go back to his regular office building any day now, but that's a whole other story. I'm hoping my next home will also contain people who are around a lot. Having another dog in the home is a must. I would be very unhappy as an only dog, which is partly why I was surrendered. My former family felt like I needed to be around other dog(s). I need more time and attention than they are able to provide at this time. \nI'm fairly petite so if you're in the market for a diminutive Boxer lass, I'm your girl. I'm playful and energetic, but I'm also down with a nap or a Netflix bingefest. My foster mom says I'm very easy to have around. She says I fit right in and barely needed any adjustment time. As much as I love living in my foster home, I know that it will soon be time for me to have a new home of my very own.\n\nPlease fill out application for Lambeau here: https://www.greenacresboxerrescue.com/adopt/adoption-application/",

I'm an older lady now, so my legs don't have the strength they once did and now they are a bit wobbly. I can't do stairs anymore. I do a really good job at going outside to go potty, and I enjoy short walks since my legs tire easily or just cruising in the backyard. I'm an easy girl and don't ask for much just a family to love me. I need a family where I can be their one and only, the apple of their eye, the peanut butter to their jelly, the....oh, you get it! Other dogs cause me to feel on edge and after an injury to my tail that required it to be docked, I would enjoy a home where I am not around other dogs so I can relax and enjoy my golden years. I do well with kids though! I met a 2 year old little girl here and she seems pretty cool. I like her a fair bit. I also enjoy relaxing in a bed napping. With age comes more sleep they say and I'm perfectly okay with that. Do you want to know what makes me excited? Thinking about finding my new home, with my forever people, where I can live out my retirement years without any worry in the world. Do you have a quiet home where I can rest my head and get a little love?\n\nAlbert's Dog Lounge is a transporting dog rescue, meaning that we rescue many of our dogs from high kill shelters in areas of dog overpopulation. We are a specialty rescue focusing primarily on senior and special needs dogs.  The vast majority of our dogs come from the Houston, TX area where we have an entire team of volunteers, coordinators, and fosters. We do also work with local shelters, rescues, and owners.  If you apply for a dog that is currently in our local Houston program, we will work to get your dog transported to WI as quickly as possible. We ask that you have patience during this time of uncertainty and unprecedented dog adoptions nationwide. \n\nLearn more about Albert's Dog Lounge, our mission, and adoption policies by visiting Albertsdoglounge.org. \n\nOur process includes an approved application, reference checks, a homevisit, and then a meet and greet with the dog. Adoption fee is $275.\n\nBegin your application process by copying this link into your web browser: https://www.albertsdoglounge.org/apply\n\nWI Dept. Of Agriculture License Number: 474085-DS",

            "description": "Meet Rubble! Rubble is a 2 year old white male lab mix who came to the shelter as a stray through Hopkinsville Animal control. Rubble was very scared at first and took a while to warm up to the shelter staff. He is doing a lot better but will need time to adjust in a new home. Once he does adjust he is a HUGE LOVEBUG! He would do great with kiddos and would love to have a snuggle buddy! Rubble seems to be fine with dogs but is more likely to get along with females. We do not know how he would do with cats or if he is house broken but he's smart and can learn. Rubble is HEARTWORM NEGATIVE as of 11-19-20. Rubble has been neutered and brought up to date on vaccinations through the shelters spay neuter program.\n\nHis adoption fee is $36.50 and he can be microchipped for $8.25. Due to the outbreak of Covid-19 our adoption policies have changed. All adoptions are by appointment only. Call to set up an appointment to meet the animal. Dogs are $61.50 and puppies are $59 unless otherwise noted. All cats and kittens are $44 unless otherwise noted. Our system automatically updates petfinders every two hours. Feel free to email us with any questions you may have.",

            "description": "Chris Webber , aka Splotch\n\nMust have a fenced in yard and another playful dog in his forever home. As one of the FAB babies , rescued with suspected ringworm (puppies are often euthanized for that at shelters!), Chris Webber bka Splotch started life with a close call. Turned out though, it was never ringworm these poor puppies had, just a yeast infection. Once the meds started working and they began to feel better - coupled with good nutrition and the love of a foster family - the brothers all started showing their true personalities! Feisty about sums them all up!\n\nToys, chase, tug o'war, exploring - they love ALL the things. It's been a joy to watch this litter go from sickly little babies to playful, healthy, stinkers! Their foster family just loves them and their antics! They get along with dogs of all shapes and sizes and because they're so incredibly playful and used to having built in wrestle partners, they will require another dog in their home. They love kids and the activity level that goes along with them. When they have finally worn themselves out with all the playing, chasing, and just plain being adorable, they do love a good snuggle sesh. They're the total package!\n\nWe suspect they will stay small to medium since they're all around 10 pounds and 17ish weeks at this point. We're guessing they are chihuahua/heeler mixes.\n\nIf you have a spot in your home for one of these boys, their big personalities, and their larger than life ears, submit an application @maxxandme.org\n\nChris Webber is neutered, up to date on vaccines, and microchipped. His adoption donation is only $300! As with all puppies adopted through Maxx & Me, his adopter will need to commit to continue working with a positive reinforcement trainer of their choice to help him continue to become a well mannered and confident boy.\n\nTo meet any of our dogs please fill out an application on www.maxxandme.org.\n\nMaxx & Me is an all volunteer, all foster home rescue and do not have a shelter. Please allow at least 48 hours for applications to be processed (missing information may slow the process, so please take your time and be thoughtful in your answers). All dogs posted are available (so no need to ask). We place dogs based on best home for each dog and not order of applications received. Email us at maxxandmerescue@gmail.com for updates and questions. Thank you for choosing rescue.",

            "description": "Jimmy King aka Meteor\n\nMust have a fenced in yard and another playful dog in his forever home. As one of the FAB babies , rescued with suspected ringworm (puppies are often euthanized for that at shelters!), Jimmy King aka Meteor started life with a close call. Turned out though, it was never ringworm these poor puppies had, just a yeast infection. Once the meds started working and they began to feel better - coupled with good nutrition and the love of a foster family - the brothers all started showing their true personalities! Feisty about sums them all up!\n\nToys, chase, tug o'war, exploring - they love ALL the things. It's been a joy to watch this litter go from sickly little babies to playful, healthy, stinkers! Their foster family just loves them and their antics! They get along with dogs of all shapes and sizes and because they're so incredibly playful and used to having built in wrestle partners, they will require another dog in their home. They love kids and the activity level that goes along with them. When they have finally worn themselves out with all the playing, chasing, and just plain being adorable, they do love a good snuggle sesh. They're the total package!\n\nWe suspect they will stay small to medium since they're all around 10 pounds and 17ish weeks at this point. We're guessing they are chihuahua/heeler mixes.\n\nIf you have a spot in your home for one of these boys, their big personalities, and their larger than life ears, submit an application @maxxandme.org\n\nJimmy King is neutered, up to date on vaccines, and microchipped. His adoption donation is only $300! As with all puppies adopted through Maxx & Me, his adopter will need to commit to continue working with a positive reinforcement trainer of their choice to help him continue to become a well mannered and confident boy.\n\nTo meet any of our dogs please fill out an application on www.maxxandme.org.\n\nMaxx & Me is an all volunteer, all foster home rescue and do not have a shelter. Please allow at least 48 hours for applications to be processed (missing information may slow the process, so please take your time and be thoughtful in your answers). All dogs posted are available (so no need to ask). We place dogs based on best home for each dog and not order of applications received. Email us at maxxandmerescue@gmail.com for updates and questions. Thank you for choosing rescue.",

Slim was found emaciated in a local neighborhood, likely dumped to fend for himself. He quickly grew to trust people and began to open up at the shelter. He likes to play with his bowls and dog bed in his kennel, and go for walks or playtime in the yard. He walks well on a leash, and is friendly with dogs. He has shown some food guarding of his food from time to time, so he would do best in a home with older children and parents who will set forth expectations to prevent him from guarding food. He does not do well with farm animals because he has a prey drive for them. If you are searching for a tall, dark, handsome fellow, Slim is your guy! We adore him!!The first step in our adoption process is an application. Once that is received, we will contact you to make an appointment to meet the animal. \n\nAdoption Applications can be completed at www.WFAHS.org",

My Mom is a 12 lbs Black/White Terrier mix but I don't know my Dad. I'm going thru a growing spurt right now, weighing in at about 15 lbs. If you like to go for exercise in the morning, I'm your jogging pal. With the cold and the snow I get the 'morning zoomies' before I settle down for a nap. Clear your lap, here I come! Housebreaking has taken a step back, but with time and patience, we can do it! I sleep thru the night in my crate and make playing with toys my priority. Sitting for my treat when I come in from doing my business outside and trying to learn new commands is easy. Snuggling and watching TV with you is on my wish list. I want to please you and find my furever home with a family of my own. Fill out an application and get to know me with the 5 day Foster to Adopt program!\nAdoption Fee: $500.00\nWe are a Wisconsin state licensed dog rescue -WI# 402433\n\n***We do not have a central adoption center at this time. All our dogs are in private foster homes within WI. At this time we only place our dogs in areas of WI. The breed of our dogs is our best guess with the help of our veterinarians.\nOur Weight Classes are as follows:\n0- 25lbs - Small\n26- 45lbs - Medium\n46-89 - Large\n90+ X-large\nIf you are adopting an adult dog, which we consider 6 months of age or older, your adoption fee includes the following:\nSpay/Neuter, Rabies and Distemper shots, dewormed, flea & tick preventative, heartworm tested and microchipped.\nIf you are adopting a dog younger than 6 months of age, the dog will be up to date on the shots as per the dogs age. The dog will be dewormed, flea/tick preventative and microchipped. We only spay/neuter our dogs by 6 months of age. If you decide to adopt a younger dog than 6 months of age, they will need to be spayed/neutered at one of our preferred clinics. This will be determined by your contract along with the month they should have their surgery. This is included in your adoption fee.\nOnce you are approved with our rescue, you can meet any one of our dogs within the fosters home. If you are interested in the dog you met, you can take the dog home under our mandatory foster to adopt program. You receive 5 days to see if the dog is the right fit for your home.\nIf it is, we will conduct the home visit and finalize adoption. If it is not, it is returned to the foster. We are happy to find you another dog that meets your needs in your home.\nIf a dog is listed as PENDING, a family has met the dog and planning on adopting the dog after the home visit has been conducted. We always suggest sending in an application for a dog because there are times where the dogs are given back to us under the foster to adopt program. There are many reasons dogs are returned but normally it just was not the right fit for all.Please go to WWW.TAILWAGGERS911.COM under HOW TO ADOPT . We have an online application that is very easy to fill out.",

            "description": "Meet Juwan Howard!\n\nMust have a fenced in yard and another playful dog in his forever home. As one of the FAB babies , rescued with suspected ringworm (puppies are often euthanized for that at shelters!), Juwan Howard aka Chip started life with a close call. Turned out though, it was never ringworm these poor puppies had, just a yeast infection. Once the meds started working and they began to feel better - coupled with good nutrition and the love of a foster family - the brothers all started showing their true personalities! Feisty about sums them all up!\n\nToys, chase, tug o'war, exploring - they love ALL the things. It's been a joy to watch this litter go from sickly little babies to playful, healthy, stinkers! Their foster family just loves them and their antics! Chip is a little on the shy side and looks to his sister for confidence. He will need an older dog in his home to show him the ropes and help him blossom. Once comfortable, Chip is a wild child and plays like crazy! They love kids and the activity level that goes along with them. When they have finally worn themselves out with all the playing, chasing, and just plain being adorable, they do love a good snuggle sesh. They're the total package!\nWe suspect they will stay small to medium since they're all around 10 pounds and 17ish weeks at this point. We're guessing they are chihuahua/heeler mixes.\n\nIf you have a spot in your home for one of these boys, their big personalities, and their larger than life ears, submit an application @maxxandme.org\n\nJuwan Howard is neutered, up to date on vaccines, and microchipped. His adoption donation is only $300! As with all puppies adopted through Maxx & Me, his adopter will need to commit to continue working with a positive reinforcement trainer of their choice to help him continue to become a well mannered and confident boy.\n\nTo meet any of our dogs please fill out an application on www.maxxandme.org.\n\nMaxx & Me is an all volunteer, all foster home rescue and do not have a shelter. Please allow at least 48 hours for applications to be processed (missing information may slow the process, so please take your time and be thoughtful in your answers). All dogs posted are available (so no need to ask). We place dogs based on best home for each dog and not order of applications received. Email us at maxxandmerescue@gmail.com for updates and questions. Thank you for choosing rescue.",

            "description": "This is Nick, a nine-year-old American Bulldog who needs a new home.  With heavy hearts his owners have decided to rehome him.  They took Nick in as a foster in 2017 and adopted him in 2018. They worked with him to curtail his jumping up on and nipping people when they entered the house. He does so much better now and has come a long way since he was rescued from an abusive and neglectful situation when he was four years old.\n            Unfortunately, this couple, who are in their mid-60s, have suffered serious declines in their health the last couple of years and they find that Nick is simply too much for them due to his size (70 pounds) and energy.\nNick loves people and loves any positive attention they bestow on him. He does well on a leash and loves to go for walks.  He loves his toys and spends a lot of time chewing on them. He is house trained, crate trained, neutered and heart-worm free. He had his annual physical in October 2020 and is up-to-date on his shots.\nNick has not been around children, but because of his size and excitability it is highly recommend that there be no small children in the home. Older teens, not small for their age, should be fine.\nHe is NOT aggressive and does not try to dominate other dogs, but will defend himself if another large dog shows aggression toward him. Because of this, Nick should only go to a home with no other dogs, or at the most with no other large dogs. With his current family, he has been snapped at and bitten by their 14-year-old, 16-lb Parsons terrier. When that happens, Nick heads for the other side of the room and stays away from the terrier for a while. He has not been around cats so it is not known how he would react to them.\nNick is located in the mid-Florida area.  His owners will work to arrange transportation for distances over 100 miles, including out of state, to the right home or rescue.\nIf you are interested in adopting Nick, please fill out an application at http://www.betterlifepets.com/\nFor more information, please contact jkosmensky@yahoo.com or call Jill at 863-325-6964.",

            "description": "Meet Esther Elizabeth. She is FOR SURE a Hound Dog -including the digging and barking and snuggling! Once a tiny, very sick puppy, Esther (AKA \"PupPup\") is now a healthy and growing hound pup. She's gone from a 4 pounds, 5 week old baby with suspected ringworm (it was actually a very severe case of pyoderma) to a 21 pound, 16 week old juvenile. When we first rescued her, her hair would fall off in clumps every time you touched her. She maxed out at about 40% hair loss and has since grown it all back. Scars remain on her chest and legs and around her body where the infection was just so deep but they're just a testament to her past and the resiliency it took to over come. At five weeks old, she was found in a drainage ditch. Cold, wet, COVERED in scabs and already missing a big portion of her hair, the shelter pleaded for a rescue to step in and help this sick, scared baby. We jumped at the chance!\n\nIn the time we have had her, we have watched her blossom into a confident and playful, social and loving dog. Esther will require a large yard with a minimum of 6' fence. It will also need to be DIG PROOF. She will need a pack to join - not just another dog- and would love a mix of small and big, young and playful dogs. She plays with EVERY BODY and goes from one to the next wrestling and romping and then crashes in a heap. She adores children. She absolutely MUST sleep with you and wants to be touching you anytime you're sitting in close proximity. She's beyond sweet, loves being held when she's sleepy, plays rough and tumble, runs like a cantering horse, jumps like she has springs in her legs, and barks.... a lot! PupPup even talks when she stretches, including while she's sleeping! We adore this dog and tell her all the time she's lucky she's so incredibly adorable and sweet as pie since she also chews ... all the things.\n\nEsther is spayed, up to date on vaccines, and microchipped. Her adoption donation is only $300! As with all puppies adopted through Maxx & Me, her adopter will need to commit to continue working with a positive reinforcement trainer of their choice to help her continue to become a well mannered and confident girl.\n\nTo meet any of our dogs please fill out an application on www.maxxandme.org.\n\nMaxx & Me is an all volunteer, all foster home rescue and do not have a shelter. Please allow at least 48 hours for applications to be processed (missing information may slow the process, so please take your time and be thoughtful in your answers). All dogs posted are available (so no need to ask). We place dogs based on best home for each dog and not order of applications received. Email us at maxxandmerescue@gmail.com for updates and questions. Thank you for choosing rescue.",

Here's the link: DOG ADOPTION APPLICATION: https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/PPAS/Dog\n\nSevan is a female Australian shepherd mix with an estimated DOB of 11/30/2019. Sevan weighed 38.2 lbs at intake. She came to us as a stray. She loves playing outside and cuddling, Even though she is a bit undersocialized she enjoys the company of other dogs. She likes to play this game with the kennel staff where she will push her toys out of her area and wait for someone to come and throw it back to her.  Sevan's adoption fee is $190 which includes a medical exam, sterilization surgery, age-appropriate vaccinations, dewormer, heartworm testing, and a microchip. \n\nVisual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. As we get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not by breed label.\n\nOur animals change daily, so please check our lists of adoptable dogs and adoptable cats frequently. Once you find an animal you\u2019d like to adopt, the next steps are to complete an application and request a meet and greet with the foster. Make sure to be thorough and help us understand why you\u2019re interested in that particular animal \u2014 and why your home is a great fit. Based on your answers we may even have a better fit for you.\n\nAll PPAS dogs are up to date on all of their vaccines (including rabies if age appropriate), and will be microchipped and registered in the adopter's name at the time of adoption. Adopters get a free consultation at an area vet partner within 14 days of adoption. Any dog that is six months of age or older will be tested for Heartworms and if found negative, will be kept on Heartworm prevention during their shelter stay, after the adoption it is up to the adopter to continue the highly recommended Heartworm preventative treatment. Also all PPAS shelter dogs are treated with a monthly topical flea/tick preventative and we ask that adopters continue that treatment as well.  All dogs and cats per state law are sterilized before they begin their new fabulous lives with their new families.\n\nAdoption fees: Adoption fees must be paid in full at time of adoption \u2013 no partial payments are accepted. All major credit cards are accepted. Adoption fees vary. Please note if you live in the city of Ottawa a dog license fee must also be paid at time of adoption. Annual renewal of dog licenses is required between January 1st and February 15th.\n\nTaking your animal home: The State of Kansas requires that all cats and dogs must be sterilized (spayed/neutered) before going to their new homes. In most cases animals will have already been sterilized before being placed on the adoption floor and you will be able to take your new companion home with you the day of adoption. However, if the animal is not yet sterilized, they will need to stay at the shelter and we will schedule the surgery on the next available date (usually within a week). We do request that all dogs go home with a collar/leash.\n\nIf you are interested in this pet, please either email Prairie Paws Animal Shelter at info@prairiepaws.org, for an application or visit our website @ prairiepaws.org for more information.\n\nPrairie Paws Animal Shelter\n3173 HWY K68\nOttawa, KS 66067\n785-242-2967\nprairiepaws.org\ninfo@prairiepaws.org",

His owners signed him over to us and he has been recovering since. He\u2019s an amazing boy! Always happy and a little loud. \nChance is available for adoption through VCA AMHERST ANIMAL HOSPITAL! He has been neutered, is up to date on all shots. Chance is not housebroken, but I think he\u2019s a smart boy and could pick it up quickly. He is very high energy. When I say he is happy 100% of the time he is just that. Chance has barrier frustration and we are pretty sure dog aggressive but we have not put him in a situation to test if he is just aggressive because of the cage. He loves everyone at our clinic. He gets so excited every single day to see us. He needs a home that will love him and care for him and give him the \u201cChance\u201d he deserves.\nIt is unknown how he is with children. He is rambunctious so smaller children may not be a good choice for him.",

She has blossomed into a sweet, playful, loyal, loving & smart pup. She is people and pet friendly (still working on cat manners). She loves toys and playing with other dogs. She could play fetch all day! She is an expert with the doggie door and is reliably house trained. She would love an active family who has a dog that wants a playmate. She knows basic commands and respects pack manners. She is very treat motivated and can be easily trained. She shows no resource guarding to toys or food. She has no problems with separation anxiety once she is established. She enjoys long, lazy naps on the couch or on her bed. \nShe has a healthy appetite and will eat anything! No evidence of any allergies to food. She will make the perfect addition to any active family with children and other dogs. She is also a great travel companion!\nPlease submit an adoption application on our website:\nwww.FriendsofFaye.com\n? Tracy Steven Photography ??",

Her love for her human beings is unconditional! Her beauty goes beyond skin deep!\n\nSometimes you meet a girl and you just know that you've become a better person for the new friend you've brought into your life. Violet is one of those girls.\n\nShe is only 2 years old and has a lifetime of love to share with a very lucky family.\n\nDuring our day together I learned that Violet is a medium energy girl who enjoys a trail walk by the side of her friend.\n\nShe enjoys exploring, she will dip her toes into the water to cool off, she is intrigued by large cranes taking flight, she's a big believer in public show of affection and she loves car rides. One of the highlights of her day was when a nice lady pulled up next to us and told her how pretty she was, her bottom just wiggled all over.\n\nViolet is looking to be your one and only. Guaranteed, with her in your life, you will never be short on love or smiles.\n\nShe will flourish in a home where she will be included as family and have people in her life dedicated to her continued success as she continues to become the best girl she knows she can be.\n\nHere's some other info about me:\n\nViolet is a vibrant 2yr old is described as a \"Total Lovebug\" She's a friendly girl that prefers not share the attention of her humans with other pets. NO OTHER PETS!!!!!! She loves Kids (older kids recommended) as she can be a bit jumpy sometimes.\n\nViolet has such a happy outlook and just wants to have fun! She is up for walks, hikes, or a good game of fetch in the backyard! She is great in the car, and is just waiting for her new forever family. Violet enjoys going on hikes, she was such a good girl, medium energy, eager to please. She's amazing!!!! Don't wait to meet this sweet heart!!\n\nContact Freedom Brothers Rescue and Recovery at 504-613-7174 or 480-359-7109 or fill out the application.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This dog is courtesy posted for another individual or Rescue.

            "description": "Faith is an about 1-2 year old, 40 pound pit mix looking for a foster home (she is in temp foster but there are a lot of dogs there and she needs a quiet home to heal in). Her story is very sad. She was found roaming the streets very pregnant in a not so great part of town and it took weeks to catch her. She had her babies 24 hours after getting to her foster home but all the babies were still born or died at the ER vet. Faith was malnourished and had no prenatal care so it would have taken a miracle for the babies to live and they did not.\nFaith is a shy girl and needs a quiet foster/adoptive home that is experienced with scared dogs and will continue to work with her to slowly gain her confidence. She has not been dog/cat tested yet since she's had so much recent trauma. She loves comfy blankets/beds and cuddles. She needs a secure 6' fenced in yard since she's a flight risk and no kids just to be safe.\nApplications can be found @ maxxandme.org\nFaith will be spayed (very recently postpartum), up to date on vaccines, and microchipped. Her adoption donation is only $250!\nMaxx & Me is an all volunteer, all foster home rescue and do not have a shelter. Please allow at least 48 hours for applications to be processed (missing information may slow the process, so please take your time and be thoughtful in your answers). All dogs posted are available (so no need to ask). We place dogs based on best home for each dog and not order of applications received. Email us at maxxandmerescue@gmail.com for updates and questions. Thank you for choosing rescue.",

            "description": "Rowan ACCT-A-80339\n\nPersonality: Rowan may not understand personal space, but he's definitely the best cuddler around! This sweetheart is full of love and energy. Rowan loves to play, but is also just as happy being your little spoon! \n\nThis sweet boy loves other dogs, and may whimper like a baby if you don't allow him to say hi on walks. Rowan is nervous around strangers and takes some time to warm up. But once he trusts you, he has nothing but love to give! And he may collapse onto you from time to time for a quick nap as he believes he's about 20 lbs. \n\nRowan's foster recommends a family with children over 12, as he still has some learning to do and believes he's smaller than he is. But he is one very special boy who would love to be adopted into a family who is willing to train him, play with him, and give him all of the love he deserves. You can reach Rowan's foster family at mfw26@icloud.com!\n\nVideos: \nhttps://youtu.be/0UHjPpEFY0s\nhttps://youtu.be/AWOAplo9Lvs\n\nIntake Reason: 12/3 Found Stray\nSex: Male\nAge: 11 months\nAltered: No\n\n**VIDEO**\nHeath and Rowan https://youtu.be/CW50mRAAL18\n\nMedical Observations: \n12/11 (Vet Check) -- Patient remains calm and will likely benefit from Trazodone extension.\n12/8 (Per Staff) -- Attempted to remove from kennel for full evaluation but unable to remove due to behavior. On approach, Rowan is growling and stiff at front of kennel. As assessor approaches, he is whale eyed and hard barking while urinating. Today, he has no interest in treats or Fresh Pet and remains tense throughout entire interaction. Able to leash with a loose loop but refuses to exit kennel and then lunges at handler who has to close kennel door with leash still on Rowan. Left kennel and returned a few minutes later and was able to remove leash while Rowan remained tense and growling.\n12/7 (Per Vet) -- BAR; nervous\n12/7 (Per Staff) -- Was checked in this morning. Unable to perform full evaluation but was able to remove Rowan from kennel.\n12/7 (Intake Exam) -- Left eye red\n\nBehavior Observation:\n12/13 (Per Staff)-- He was quiet in the kennel, and easily leashed. He walked outside the building and sniffed surrounding. When we first approached the group he focused on another dog, but was easily distracted by changing direction. A male handler approached slowly and he hid behind my leg. Handler backed off and female handler approached, let him sniff her side, and he wagged his tail and she took him and he went for a walk and became playful. He met the male handler again and greeted him playfully. He had a dog meet with Heath through the fence, and then in the parking lot. Both were high energy and did well, play bowing and running circles around one another, and then when pulled away from Heath he stopped jumping and calmed down. He was easily put back in his kennel with no issue. \n12/10 (Per Staff)-- \nKennel Presentation---Nervous---Took a couple of attempts to get a loop around him but otherwise stepped out easily and was returned to kennel easily with no issues.\nLeash Skills---Pulls Strongly On Leash---Would do best harnessed\nHandleability----Aroused/Allows all handling\nTag---Aroused---But will engage in play. Runs closely towards the handler but does not actually come into contact with them. Lots of zooms!\nToys---Accepts a trade----Trades toy for toy - mostly ball for ball. Shows attempts to drop ball in handler's lap but keeps mouth too close to attempt to take and toss again for him\n12/11 (Per vet) -- standing calmly in kennel, no barking\n12/8 (Per Staff)-- On approach, Rowan is growling and stiff at front of kennel. As assessor approaches, he is whale eyed and hard barking while urinating. Today, he has no interest in treats or Fresh Pet and remains tense throughout entire interation. Able to leash with a loose loop but refuses to exit kennel and then lunges at handler who has to close kennel door with leash still on Rowan. Left kennel and returned a few minutes later and was able to remove leash while Rowan remained tense and growling.\n12/7 (Per Staff) Tense and growling on bed when handler approaches kennel door. Softens when presented with Fresh Pet and sniffs handler's hand but does not take treats from hand nor once dropped on floor. Tail is tucked but wags when presented with leash. Still tense but allows himself to be slowly leashed. Once leashed, loosens and exits kennel. Pulls moderately through building and outside. Startles and tenses at loud noises (dumpster being lifted, cars honking) and initially stays full leash length ahead of handler. In grass, approaches handler and allows slow pets to rear but quickly becomes overaroused, sniffing at handler's shoes and pant legs so handler starts walking with Rowan following but still in a state of arousal, sniffing at back of handler's pants so handler uses treats to distract. Rowan then falls into a walk alongside handler. Did not attempt further handling besides returning Rowan to kennel. Rowan went straight into kennel and allowed leash to be removed with loose body. After leash was removed, Rowan allowed pets to head and shoulders with loose body and no signs of arousal.\n12/6 (Per Vet) -- Unable to remove from kennel for eval. Whale eyed, stiff and growling. No interest in treats or cheese. No reaction to leash when presented.\n12/5 (Per Vet) -- Unable to check in due to behavior. Dog's tail is wagging low, but dog is growing, licking lips and giving whale eyes. \n12/3 (Per Vet) -- Dog was placed directly in kennel by KA without stopping at dog intake. Went to kennel, dog was low growling with tense body language.\n12/3 (Per Finder) -- Happy, loose body language. Met 6, 5, 3 year old children and showed no aggression, was loose, relaxed, around them.\n\n\nThis animal is currently available from foster care through ACCT Philly's Adoptions Programs.

            "description": "Guinevere is looking forward to 2021 just as much as the rest of us! She\u2019s ready to start a new life. Guinevere had a tough start to life and came to us from a hoarding situation, with very little human contact. After two months in her foster home, she is doing much better and starting to learn that humans can be good! Guinevere, adoringly referred to as Gwen, is housebroken, leash trained and crate trained. She\u2019s focusing on socialization and getting used to human contact. Training and commands will come next. Gwen is a low activity level gal who is happy to lounge all day in her dog bed, or in the yard, if the weather is nice. She\u2019s looking for a quiet life, as loud noises startle her and cause her to shut down - hiding in a corner trying not to be seen. Gwen enjoys the company of the furry and feathery friends in her foster home and is doing great with the 6 cats, goats and free range chickens! Gwen gets along with other dogs but hasn\u2019t decided if she wants to play with them yet, so an older, not-so-playful canine pal would be best for her. Gwen\u2019s past has made her very fearful of men and boys. She does better warming up to females but needs her space and time to trust. Gwen is working hard to learn that the world, particularly men and loud noises, are not so scary. She is looking for a patient family, that will give her the time and space she needs to learn these things. Gwen is striving to overcome her emotional challenges. In 2021, she deserves a home in which her family will appreciate her for the quietly, courageous girl she is!\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nNGPR dogs are in foster homes throughout the U.S., NOT Beacon, NY. View full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.\n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

I sometimes don\u2019t show well in a cage or behind a barrier but once I\u2019m out and about I\u2019m a bundle of energy. I\u2019m a sensitive and misunderstood boy so it takes me a little bit of time to get to know someone before I give them my trust. Once I know you, we\u2019ll be the best of friends, especially if you play fetch with me -- it\u2019s my FAVORITE activity! I\u2019m looking for a household where I\u2019m preferably the only pet and the only youngin', so children in the home are a no for me. Call the shelter today to schedule an appointment to come in and fall in love.\n\n\n**Upon adoption approval, all PAHS animals are spayed/neutered, up to-date on all vaccinations and microchipped.

The most accurate and up to date information about adoptable pets is on our official website at www.caretoadopt.org. Gentle soul!Jonas is STUNNING and has the personality to go with it! Based on experience, we believe he is American Staffordshire Terrier. That is just an educated guess.Jonas is good with people and small children. He is extremely well mannered in the house and dog crate, but don't recommend leaving him alone in a house just yet. Jonas is still learning about a collar and leash, but does well - just slow to walk at times. Jonas with other pets: We know he was fine with his momma dog and sibling, but not sure about other dogs. He is curious about kittens and small dogs, but would definitely need to be tested and trained with them.Jonas loves to be right by his person's side. He also likes to help us work sometimes. ;-) If you're looking for a loving, low key, devoted companion - Jonas is the one! He makes us wish we could adopt one more!\nA completed adoption application and home visit are required for approval to adopt a CARE dog. We do adopt out of state if all vetting is complete.

I've had a rough start to the 8th year of my life as I lost my back leg and am now what they call a tripod! I have no idea what that means, but it seems to get me a lot of attention, so I'll go with it. I'm currently in foster with my human buddy that has been helping me get used to this new three-legged life. They tell me I'm a good boy and they call me a rockstar because every animal (cats and dogs alike) that I meet, I get along with! However, I do prefer human pals to furry pals because I prefer to relax over playing, but I would still love to get to know any furry friends you have in your home. Don't I sound perfect? If you'd like to meet me, give the shelter a call and we can schedule a time for us to meet! I am heartworm positive but my treatment is included with my adoption fee and will be administered at the shelter.",

He is a very well behaved boy, who knows to use his manners and does so most of the time. He is very alert to his surroundings and likes to know what is going on around him. Weston walks on a leash, but does need a firm,strong hand as he does pull, he is not an excessive barker (in fact i have only heard him bark just a few times), but he does have a high energy level and knows how to flip latches on gates. He gently takes treats from your hand and will give you a kiss or two if allowed. He has shown himself to be a sweetheart and has been very well behaved and easy to handle since coming to be with us and has not shown any aggressive behaviors towards staff or other canines.\n\nWeston is micro chipped and his owner was contacted and informed of his location, however his owner has chosen not to reclaim him. Weston is current on all his vaccinations.  He is listed as a special needs pet because his Heart worm antigen test was positive.  He is available now for adoption/rescue.Shelter ID# \n",

She already knows a handful of basic cues, and this holiday, she is determined to further brush up on her other house manners so she can be the pyrfect girl for her furever family. These days, Skye is busy being a pup - she loves playing with other playful dogs, and when she is on her own, she loves to explore her large selection of chews and indestructible toys. Even at such a young age, Skye takes her responsibility of guarding the home very seriously. She enjoys patrolling the property, making sure there are no pesky intruders. When out and about, Skye is learning that people mean additional affection and belly rubs, which she is eager to repay with hugs and kisses :) This lovely girl has all the potential to be your best fur companion, she just needs some guidance to help her achieve her best possible self that she can be. Skye will thrive in an active family who will dedicate the time and patience to guide her along as she matures. Are you willing to give this lovely girl a chance to be your best friend?\n\nNYS Registered Rescue # RR102\nView full listing, fee and online application at - www.nationalpyr.org/adoptable-dogs (sorry, no phone submissions, but if you would like more information you can email us at renpyrgroup@yahoo.com).\n\nSecure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed. \n\nOur goal is to assess every application on its own merits. Key considerations are: 1) the experience of the applicant with large breed dogs 2) children in the household or regularly visiting the household are ready for a large-breed dog who is a guardian by nature (www.nationalpyr.org/know-the-breed) and 3) the sex of other dogs currently residing in the household to avoid same-sex aggression issues. For puppies under six months old, the applicant\u2019s ability to socialize the puppy with older dogs is a priority.",

I have a smile on my face, and will always come up to the door to say hi when I see you! I like playing with other dogs, as long as I can be the boss of the yard! I'm the queen, and I wanna make sure everyone knows it!. I'm very gentle, and love getting attention. I hope you'll meet me and say hi!\n\nTo find out more about me you can fill out a pre-adoption survey on our website, then email it to us.

            "description": "75$ of Lulu's adoption fee has been sponsored!\n\nPersonality: Lulu is very people social and affectionate. She has a goofy, quirky, and bouncy personality. She is eager to please and will look to her human friends for direction. She loves to play with tennis balls and frisbees! She is also high energy and loves to go for long runs, and would love a household that can give her routine exercise to burn her energy. \n\nHistory: She arrived to the shelter as a stray. She lived in a foster home with 2 adults and 2 children. She has shown to be tentative at times with kids but can also become rowdy with them when comfortable. She is also excitable in an active, noisy home environment. Lulu would do best in a calm home environment and with an experienced family that can manage this behavior. \n\nDog Skills: Lulu is uncomfortable meeting dogs and is looking for a home as the only dog in the household.\n\nCats Skills: We have observed reactive behavior toward cats, squirrels, birds, etc. Lulu is required to be the only animal in her future household because of this behavior. \n\nLeash Skills: Walks nicely on leash with the use of a front clip harness. Lulu can walk calmly on a leash but can become excited/frustrated when seeing dogs, cats, wildlife. She can become vocal, jumpy, and abruptly spins in circles. She would do best with a low traffic neighborhood.\n\nMedical:\nLulu arrived at HSSV with a history of \"spinning\" when excited. When she gets excited or over stimulated she spins and circles to the right. It is very easy to get her to calm down and stop spinning with redirection and distraction. Based on her history, and a consultation with a veterinary neurologist, we believe this is a stable condition.\n\nReady to meet Lulu?

            "description": "Handsome Lewis is approximately 12-14 months old and is a petite male at 58 lbs. He\u2019s good with other dogs and we suggest a playful friend in the family for some good \u201cwear him out\u201d  zoomies . He\u2019s in a foster home with 5 other dogs and enjoys their company.  He settles well too,  so if you like a couch buddy he\u2019s good with snuggles and a good TV show.  His potty incidents were we believe , due to crystals in the urine so he is on a urinary food ( $90 a month). His love of water is approved for  his Olympian swimming and ball fetching , but does need to be taken away at 6 pm. He is young so will get into stuff if not watched ( ahem . He\u2019s a lab !) but he does crate well so if you\u2019re busy,  give him a chew and he can hang out for abit in the crate.  No long hours folks  .... just won\u2019t suit him . \nLewis was found in the parking lot of a grocery store . Probably dumped . He is neutered , vaccinated and microchipped and thoroughly vetted !!  Lewis IS NOT good with cats or chickens so we think little dogs might not work either although that has not been tested.  Lsawllabrescue@gmail.com for an application \nVet checks / home visits are a requirement .\n",

What better way to embrace the cold than by adopting a new pal like Selena?\n\nSelena is one mighty fine Coonhound mix! We estimate her to be around 6 years of age. Selena can be pretty timid around hoomans, but starts to warm up with a little bit of baby talk and some yummy treats. Because she is a hound through and through, she must go to a home. The apartment/townhome life is not for a dog like her.\n\nAs far as other animals go, we know for sure that Selena cannot live with small animals (chickens, cats, etc.) due to her prey drive. Selena must meet any dogs already in the home prior to adoption to make sure they would be a good match. From what we can tell, she seems to prefer male dogs over female dogs.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in meeting this majestic lass, give us a ring at 804-991-3200 to set up an appointment today!\n\nIf you have any questions about our adoptable pets, we can be reached by phone at 804-991-3200 or by email at pganimals@princegeorgecountyva.gov.\n\nBe sure to check out our Facebook and Instagram pages at Facebook.com/pganimals and Instagram.com/pganimals!",

            "description": "Animal Profile:\nBahamas is a senior terrier/chihuahua mix (best guess!) who originally joined us from Hawaii. He is estimated to be 8 years old, but we suspect he may be a little bit older than that (closer to 10+) as he has developed cataracts in his eyes. Bahamas was originally rescued from Hawaii, and joined us in Seattle almost 2 years ago. He landed a wonderful home in Seattle, but due to some very unfortunate circumstances/unexpected life changes, he is back in our care and looking for his forever home to retire to.\n\nFoster Update: Bahamas is a gentle, sweet and shy pup looking for a special home to retire to. While quite shy and timid at first, Bahamas' personality continues to blossom by the week under the care of his foster family, who have been committed to helping his confidence grow. We have yet to meet a pup that loves his crate and special dog bed as much as this guy! He will happily, and quietly, snooze away during the work day. His crate was his favorite spot when he first arrived in foster care, but as the weeks go on - he is choosing cozy dog beds around the house instead. Bahamas will come running anytime he hears his meal being prepared - it's prety cute. He is a sucker for a delicious meal or special treat. During his first weeks in foster care, Bahamas was pretty timid on leash and kept his potty breaks short in the yard. As he continues to come out of his shell, he is slowly starting to gain his confidence in the outside world. Walks have still been shorter excursions for him, but his foster family has been able to expand his experiences by slowly increasing the distances for him. He has been polite encountering other dogs on leash, but really prefers his space when on walks. To this day, he has yet to have an accident in the home. Bahamas has lived in a home with other dogs before, and while he does not particularly engage in play or seek out their affection - he does feel at ease with another dog around and we do catch picking up cues from the resident dog. Bahamas is looking for a mellow canine companion in his forever home, one that will help him continue to come out of his shell a bit more. Bahamas' ideal home would be a quiet household with patient humans who are okay with going slow at first to help Bahamas adjust and settle in, as well as committed to help this boy continue to grow his confidence. This sweet boy very much deserves a loving home to retire to. Could that home be with you?\n\nAdoption Info: Adoption fee is $400, which includes spay/neuter, current core vaccinations - Rabies, DAPPV, Bordetella, microchip, health certificate, and heartworm test. All adoption fees are donations to a Washington non-profit corporation and all donations go to benefit the animals in our rescue.\n\nApply online at www.DogGoneSeattle.org\n\nAnimal History: This dog was rescued from euthanasia at a high-kill shelter in Hawaii and joined us from Kauai Humane Society rescue partner. This dog will be available for adoption in Seattle once evaluated.\n\nAbout Foster to Adopt Program:\nFosters provide a safe landing spot for dogs transitioning from the shelter environment and help prepare the dogs for adoption. You provide the love and structure, and we take care of everything else! We cover all vet care, and drive the adoption process. Average length of foster is 2-3 weeks. Fosters do get first consideration for adoption, if desired.\n\nApply to foster online at www.doggoneseattle.org/foster-application",

She was heavily matted with fleas and her eyes were crusted shut and she unable to see. The property owner who found her turned her over to us. We discovered she was microchipped. The chip company tried to contact her listed owner on her microchip but it was unfortunately a dead end. We, of course, immediately cleaned her up. We gave her Bravecto and shaved her. After a warm bath, including good ear and eye cleaning, she felt so much better!  We then took her to the vet for complete exam, vaccines and heartworm testing, which was negative! She went back to the vet for a dental cleaning, then to the eye specialist vet for an exam. She was diagnosed with severe dry eye and glaucoma in one blinded eye. The other eye has a cataract but it is thin enough so she can still see. Next, she had surgery to remove the painful blind eye. She is finally all well and ready for a home to call her own!  Phew! Miraculously, she will only need 2 drops daily to maintain her eye health and comfort. She is a sweet outgoing and friendly dog that loves treats. Her favorite thing is eating! She gets along well with other dogs. If you are interested in adopting Sweetie, please go to floridacocker.org and fill out an adoption application. For more information, please call 813-245-1833. \n",

It is estimated that he will be around the 90-pound range when fully grown. \n\nEzra is very high energy and he hits the ground running. He is highly intelligent and incredibly trainable but will need a knowledgeable and breed-experienced family to help him succeed. Ezra is most successful when he receives several hours of exercise on a daily basis. This includes playtime in a fenced area or in structured daycare. Ezra also loves food toys such as slow feed bowls, frozen kongs, and snuffle mats that allow him to use intelligence to reach a goal. \n\nEzra is very social and playful and would do well as the apple of your eye or with an equally confident, energetic, and playful dog friend. He also does well with older, dog-savvy children but it is unknown how he would do with cats.\n\nEzra has mastered his crate training. He is working on his house and leash training. It will take some time but he knows that he will get help from his forever family to assist him in the process. \n\nThis boy is a diamond in the rough with lots of potentials to be a wonderful canine companion. He will need to have the support of his family that will provide him will all the resources needed to harness his abundant energy but the result will be a loving and sweet canine companion. \n\nEzra's adoption fee is $450. That includes the cost of spaying/neutering, up to date vaccinations, foster care, rescue, and transport fees.\u00a0\n\nTo get the ball rolling, head over to our Adoption Application and submit your application today.\u00a0\n\nA Dog Star representative will contact you within 24 hours.\u00a0\n\nTo help speed up the process contact your vet and give them permission to speak with us.\n\nIf you do not get a response within 24\u00a0 hours, check your spam folder.",

She is up to date on shots, heartworm negative, house broken, crated trained and will be spayed in the next few weeks. She walks well on a leash and takes her treats gently. She loves her humans! At this time, Holly is dog selective so it would probably be best if she was an only dog so she can have all the attention. \n\nHolly loves having a yard to run and play in, but she also likes to snuggle on the couch with her people.

She was owner surrendered and while she came to ARF very shy she has opened up into a wonderful dog! Chocolate still takes time to warm up to new people but she loves spending her time playing in the sunshine and running around with the other little dogs here at ARF. She has tons of affection to give and is sure to make a lovely addition to a family in need of a calmer, older dog. She would love having a dog sibling to chase around the yard but would be fine as an only pet too. She loves riding in the car! If interested in Chocolate, just click the ADOPT button and that will take you to an application. Once approved you will be called for an appointment to meet your possible new family member, or at that time you can meet the other animals as well. https://petstablished.com/public/search/shelter/301551\n\nAdoption fee is $150 which includes, spay/neuter, vaccines, etc, and a free 1 year membership to our 5 acre ARF Park. For other dog questions please email ARFdogs74006@gmail.com\n\nWe do adopt out of state, but the adopter must travel to ARF to meet the dog they are looking to adopt. They must have an approved application before traveling to meet the dog. We do allow small dogs that are eligible to fly in the cabin of a plane. We DO NOT allow dogs to travel in the cargo area of the plane under any circumstances. Any dog that is adopted can of course go by personal vehicle. We do not allow dogs to be transported \"pony express style\" where they are passed from driver to driver.",

            "description": "SPECIAL MEDICAL CONDITION -- pulmonary stenosis, requires surgery; 4-5 years, 11 lbs, Chiweenie mix\n\nPlease welcome our special little dude Pokki. He's sweet and very much a good boy. Pokki has a heart condition called pulmonary stenosis. It does require surgery. Basically one of his valvs is closed and the surgery will open it up. Without surgery his life expectancy will not be super long. He's been fine so far in his life but as he gets older his risk of going into sudden heart failure is greater. He is not neutered due his heart condition, he is not cleared for surgery. But, his behavhiour has not been effected by this at all. He behaves very well and is tottaly house trained. He's just looking for his special adopter that can take care of his heart conditon. \n\nPokki is a very mellow dude who just wants to be part of the family. He can be a little nervous at first but warms up fairly quickly with the right people. He's working on his outdoor confidence in the city. His dream home will be out of the city where he doesn't have to deal with the hussle and bussle. He's houstrained and very respectful of the home. Litle kids can stress Pokki out. But respectful and gentle teenageres would be okay. Ingrested in adotping? Please go to www.socialteesnyc.org or reach out to your point person. \n\nHIs Foster Mom Says: \"Pokki is ready to wiggle his way into your heart and home! He's approximately 10 pounds and 4-5 years old, and just as sweet as can be. Pokki is mellow, and would happily spend the day curled up next to you on the couch or chewing his favorite bone. When he's happy, he wriggles around on his back and looks up at you like a little seal pup. Pokki's foster mom says he's just a dream - fully housebroken (does his business quickly outside and can use wee wee pads), exceptionally quiet in the apartment, sleeps peacefully in his crate, and knows \"sit\" and \"paw.\" He gets along well with other dogs and children. Pokki is a homebody who gets a little nervous when it's time to go outside on the busy city street, but he is gaining confidence and just needs a little extra patience and encouragement as he continues to learn to trust the outside world. Pokki has not been neutered, but shows no signs of marking or dominant behavior - in fact, he lets his smaller, neutered foster brother boss him around. Pokki has a heart condition - it is treatable but serious, and needs surgery to fix a blocked valve. Pokki would make a wonderful pet in a low-to-medium active home with a family who adores him as much as he adores them. Sometimes when he's asleep, Pokki starts wagging his tail, and we're pretty sure he's dreaming of his happy future in his new forever home. \"\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This animal is not at the Social Tees office all of our dogs and cats are in foster homes while they wait to find their forever families. :) If youd like to apply to adopt this pet, please complete an adoption application at socialteesnyc.org. Because we are a small team and receive hundreds of applications each week, we are unable to respond to every application and every inquiry email, but we do our best. Please have patience! If your application is approved, you will for sure hear from us. If you have questions, please take a look at the Adoption and Fostering FAQs etc. on our website as all common questions are answered there. Thank you for your understanding and flexibility as we work to save these innocent lives!! \n\nLEARN MORE ABOUT US: socialteesnyc.org; Instagram via @socialteesnyc; Facebook.com/socialteesanimalrescue",

            "description": "Pepita is a sweet little girl who was released from a commerical breeding facility and is loving her new life outside of a cage. She weighs 7 pounds and is 8 years old. Pepita arrived in rescue with a large mammary tumor and severe dental disease. The tumor was removed (and was later found to be malignant) and she had 17 teeth pulled. She is a bit shy, but after she gets comfortable in her surroundings she lets her feisty side come out. She does love to bark, so an apartment would not be a good fit for her. She loves to be held and snuggle up for a nice long nap. She gets along well with the resident dog. She is doing well so far with potty training, but needs to be taken out often. She loves to run and play outside, and does not even mind the snow! \n\nPepita has had a couple of bouts of pancreatitis, so the vet has recommended that she be on prescription food to since her tummy is a little sensative. \n\n\n\tThe requirements for Pepita: No exceptions. \n\tA fenced in yard is a must. She does not understand the leash at all. \n\tDue to Pepita's small size, we believe a home without small children would be best for her. \n\n\nThe pathology report indicated that the mammary tumor that was removed was malignant. We do not know what the future holds for Pepita, but we are hopeful that the vet was able to remove all of the cancer and that it won't return. \n\nHer adoption fee is $250. She is up to date on her shots.",

My name is Gina, and I am a low-energy lady who would love to curl up on the couch with you so we can catch up on our stories. As a lady of leisure, I would prefer a calmer home and would do best with older children if you have kiddos since I prefer a zen atmosphere. I get along with other dogs - mostly I am indifferent to them, though I do enjoy going for walkies with the other doggie in my foster home since she helps me keep some pep in my step. I am mostly potty trained - I do better with frequent breaks outside, but am learning to hold it for longer lengths of time - and am crate trained. When I think about my forever home, I imagine a place with lots of cushy doggie beds and a very comfortable couch so I can love and lounge. Wanna pamper me? Then go ahead and fill out that adoption application today!\n\nADOPTION REQUIREMENTS, NO EXCEPTIONS:\n*ADOPTION FEE: $300\n*Be at least 21 years of age\n*Live in a 50-mile radius of Itasca, within the Illinois border\n*Have the knowledge and agreement of all adults living in the household\n*Have approval from owner of residence (written in lease)\n*Have a valid ID with current address (please provide proof of address if ID address is not up-to-date)\n*Be approved as a suitable adoptive home by Fetching Tails Foundation\n*Be prepared to make a lifetime commitment\n\nIf interested please fill out an application on our website at www.fetchingtailsfoundation.org; please make sure you fill in every required field/question or your submission will not go through. Please note that we take time to learn as much as we can about each dog in our care and our bios are our current observations; we are unable to make any guarantees on the future health or temperament of your adopted dog. Most dogs in our care come with unknown pre-rescue history and as such breed and age estimates are an educated guess.",

We have partners we work with there that pull these dogs from the worst horrors imaginable before they are set to be on someone's dinner plate.\nMany of these dogs start off in horrific puppy mill type facilities on tiny rabbit cage size wire crates in complete filth. If they are not sold at 6 or 8 weeks then they either stay for a couple years to be used to breed more and then are sold off to the meat trade, or they are sold off right away. South Korea is one of the only countries that actually farms dogs for their meat. Little dogs are used for elixirs and potions.\nAroo and several of her friends have been flown here for a chance at a future and a real life. Our adoption fee is $600 which helps offset some of the flight costs.

            "description": "Hiya everyone; meet the active Arvy (pronounced RV)! Arvy is a 1.5 year old Red Heeler X Pug mix and weighs approximately 30-35 lbs. Arvy came to us as an owner surrender along with his daughter Willow (who has already been adopted) and another litter of puppies that he had fathered (who have gone on transport to another rescue group through ARATT). All of the dogs were living outdoors on tethers and are thoroughly enjoying the central heat/air in the rescue housing! Arvy is finally neutered and is now ready for his forever home! He is still working the excess hormones out of his system (this can take a couple months) and wants to mark when outside smelling around. He has mastered the dog doors in our rescue housing and lets himself out to potty now whenever he pleases. Arvy gets along with some dogs (not all), he is a dominant boy and does best with dogs that do not challenge him. He is a very high energy boy and some other dogs do not appreciate his constant \"play mode.\" He loves toys of all kinds, but squeaky toys are his favorite! Arvy is too high energy and is a little too interested in cats, so we believe he would do best in a home without feline friends. He also likes children, especially older kids that are able to play with him (he will jump up on little ones and could accidentally knock them down). Arvy is a great car rider and usually rides crated, however he will free ride well once he calms down. If you are looking for an active partner for long walks, jogs, and adventures; look no further than Arvy!",

Volunteers say Mary Jane is all waggly tail during her walks and very well behaved, leashing up easily and walking politely. She doesn't react to other dogs and is described as an easygoing dog.

She is about four years old and weighs 55lbs.\n\nRosie is a sweet, loving, active girl.  She loves to run more than anything and loves to be taken on daily 2-3 mile walks. \n\nShe also loves being outside and needs to be in a home that has ample outside yard space for her to play in.\n\nRosie needs to be in a home with adults and or adults or older teens as she startles easily and does not do well with the hustle and bustle and unpredictability of younger children.\n\nRosie does fine with adults, sometimes loving to curl up with her favorite person, and sometimes preferring to sit quietly on her own.\nRosie does okay with other dogs but likes to be the boss. She likes to protect her space and family members. We don\u2019t know how she is with cats.\n\nRosie will go in a crate, but because she does not chew and is not destructive, was not in a crate in her previous home.  She had the run of the house and loves to snooze on the couch.\n\nRosie\u2019s ideal home would be to a person or couple that does not have young kids or grandkids around and like to be outside and active. \n\nShe is spayed, vaccinated, microchipped, and housebroken.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please go to www.luckylabrescue.com and complete an adoption application.",

            "description": "Did somebody say... TENNIS BALL???\n\nKipper hopes you did, because that means it's time to PLAY! Playtime is Kipper's favorite time, if you couldn't tell by the excitement clear on his face, and he just knows his forever family is reading this pet bio right now and getting ready to go to the store to buy a pack of tennis balls. \n\nKipper recently came to THS from another shelter, and since being here we've all come to love him! How could we not, when Kipper is a big goofball who loves nothing more than to run around and play (have we mentioned how much he loves tennis balls yet, or no?) However, at the end of the day, all Kipper wants is a lap to lay his head on, and a new forever family to scratch his nose and ears.\n\nKipper can be a rough player and will need a family that can help manage his play behavior. He can be jumpy/mouthy and will need an adopter who is willing to train him and teach him appropriate manners. Because he doesn't know his own size, he should not go to a home with young/small children. Kipper cannot go to a home with any cats and should meet any resident dogs before being adopted! Kipper also plays rough and inappropriate with other dogs, and many dogs do not enjoy his play behavior. \n\nKipper went to a home for the holidays and the family he stayed with had so much fun with him! His foster mom said he was also very good about pottying outside and let them know when he wanted to go out and never had an accident. If you'd like to see some of his adventures in action, follow this link from his foster family!\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-JRsl2wTUYcebvwSDMTRNFXkIwqZp2ZA\n\nKipper is back in foster while he waits to be adopted, and so he can work on those manners! If you are interested in adopting Kipper, please email foste@toledohumane.org!",

Fun fun fun is on his adjenda so he'd do really well with another dog to play with. Duke is good with children but can easily knock small children over and can be a handful himself. He would do well with taking a basic training class like every puppy should. \n\nDuke came into rescue with a heart murmur and has had his consultation and echo cardiogram with a cardiologist at the Oakland Veterinary Referal Services in Michigan. He has been diagnosed with a grade V/VI systolic murmur over the left and right thorax and the great news is that Duke doesn't currently require any medication and his activity doesn't need to be monitored. Duke's cardiologist doesn't feel that he'll need any type of heart surgery or heart procedure in the future. He might need to go on a diaretic at some point in his life but they don't feel that he'll need other heart medications. Duke will need to be rechecked by a cardiologist in 9 months to 1 year.",

            "description": "Available for adoption in Texas: Stunning SOFIA!\n\nSofia is about six-years-old and weighs about 70 pounds. \n\nSofia had a difficult start to life. She was lost as a six-month-old puppy, and she was found over six years later! Can you imagine? Her original owners were unable to take her back when Lucky Lab tracked them down. She obviously had been used for breeding in the last six years, and life turned out very different for her than it should have.\nSofia needs an experienced dog owner with patience, who can give her time to decompress, and learn what\u2019s to be expected in her home. She desires a lot of human attention and we think she would do best in a home where her person is with her often.\n\nSofia is as playful as a young adult dog, romping, and wrestling with her four-legged foster sibling is a lot of fun! She asserted herself as the top dog in her foster home when she arrived, so she may have some alpha tendencies.\n\nSofia doesn\u2019t seem to know the word \u201csit,\u201d but she instinctively knows to sit when she approaches someone or they approach her. If she doesn\u2019t get pet fast enough though, she'll paw at them to let them know they need to hurry it up! And belly rubs\u2026ohhh belly rubs!! This is the key to her heart. Sofia much prefers to roll over immediately for a belly rub, as opposed to getting a pet on the head. Belly rubs are life for this girl!\n\nSofia has come a long way with crate training. She is now fully crate trained and enjoys having that space of her own! In the evenings, especially, she often just goes into her crate to take a nap. She is crated when no one is home, as well as, overnight.\n\nSofia is house trained but may have an occasional accident if it's raining, as she is not of fan of going outside when her princess paws may get wet (much like her foster sibling \u2013 silly girls!). Sofia has also exhibited some minor storm anxiety in her foster home. She's not really a fan of the car, so she'd do best in a home where someone is content with a doggy in the home and isn't hoping for a ride-along buddy.\n\nSofia has grown very fond of the toy box and has her favorites...namely giant rope toys, and nylabones! She also loves food and gets very excited for meal-time. She is best fed with a slow-feeder bowl so she doesn't inhale her kibble, and bonus - she gets in a little mental stimulation at the same time!\n\nSofia loves and craves attention, but doesn\u2019t always know how to ask for it correctly, so a patient adopter will be key to her success. She has also been known to be pretty vocal, and she tries to use whining to get her way. As she decompresses and settles into a home, we believe this may improve.\n\nWe suspect Sofia never met a leash before she came into Lucky Lab, so she could use a lot of assistance in that area if leash walking is a desired skill. Her 70 lb self is super strong and has been known to pull her foster mom around. For the most part in her foster home, she currently just enjoys backyard time!\n\nSofia is spayed, vaccinated, and microchipped, and she\u2019s ready for her furever home.\n\nIf you think you could provide the perfect home for this gal, please go to www.luckylabrescue.com and complete an adoption application.",

Due to an injury sustained before she came to Happily Ever After, Carti's back legs are paralyzed. But she doesn't let that slow down her energy or her spirit. Carti is a sweetheart who wants nothing more than a forever home with all of the love and attention she can handle. She also gets along great with other dogs!\n\nBecause of Carti's injury, she will need a home without stairs. But she can navigate in and out the door like it is her job! Carti does great moving around independently, whether she's using her cart or just her front legs. She loves to zoom around in her cart and showing off her motoring skills! Carti's forever family will be accepting of her differences and understand that because of her injury, she does have some incontinence. We can't all be perfect and we think perfect is overrated anyway! Carti is sweet, gentle, and so loving. She's so ready to find a family to give all of her love to. If you think your home could be Carti's happily ever after, apply to meet her today!",

He likes a good ear scratching and will give kisses as payment.\n\nAt 82 pounds, Bellagio is a strong guy, but he walks well on leash. He\u2019s doing well on a schedule of 2-3 walks a day. He\u2019s housebroken. As for crates\u2026well, he\u2019s a master demolisher and will need the heavy-duty kind.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a smart, handsome boy who will be endlessly loyal, consider Bellagio. He is destined to be someone\u2019s devoted companion.\n\nInterested in adopting this dog?

This pup wows every person he meets, and here's why: \n\n* He's a great communicator. This deaf dog knows lots of hand signals. Sit, stay, down - he's happy to follow your direction (especially if you have a treat, a stick, or a walk to offer). \n\n* He's an amazing entertainer. Have you ever seen a dog sneak up on a stick, twirl it, roll on it, and then throw it at your feet? Or have you seen a dog jump around and munch on bubbles for 20 minutes at a time? It's quite the show. \n\n* He's housetrained, non-destructive, and always up for a round of fetch. \n\n* Did we mention he likes sticks? \n\nOkay, okay, now before you get in line to meet with this flirt of a dog, let us tell you what Mr. Juke is looking for in his forever home: \n\n* Juke enjoys PG-13 movies. He sometimes has to throw a dollar or two in the swear jar. He drinks his coffee black. (Just kidding, please don't give dogs coffee, but do you catch our drift?) Juke is attentive to his handler so he's fine living in a neighborhood where kids hang out, but he'd be most comfortable in a home with only adults and older teenagers. \n\n*STICKS. Are you prepared to provide an adequate number of sticks?\n\n\nYou can follow Juke's story at the shelter through his Instagram page at https://www.instagram.com/juke_box_her0/. \n\nIf you are interested in meeting Juke, please submit an adoption application at caspca.org!

My ID number is 335331\n\nI am available for adoption; however due to my breed my adoption will have to be facilitated through a rescue organization. Please see the front desk staff or contact the Shelter at (248) 858-1070 for more information.\n\nMeet Savvy! Is this fella cute or what? Savvy isn't just another pretty face, this guy is smart, knowing several commands, is housebroke, does good with children and cats. Savvy is an exuberant young boy who would appreciate an active owner, willing to spend oodles of time with him. He came to live at the Shelter when his owner could no longer care for him...he was sad when he initially came to live here, however, his spirits have improved! Savvy is currently working on mastering his leash walking skills and making progress! He would love a yard to play in, someone to take him on daily walks and new special people to care for him!\n\nThe following descriptions describe behaviors that were observed during testing and/or veterinary examination: Evaluated for temperament with 334971 (male) and 335290 (female). Did well with both. Intimidated by male (submissive urination). He does not understand how big his body is. He jumps up on people. Will need basic training. Recommend advanced walkers initially. 12/7/2020\n\nAmerican Pit Bulls are a misunderstood breed; for this reason, we implore adopters to these beautiful dogs to be very vigilant in training and socialization. This breed is very energetic and will need daily exercise. Because of their strength and energy, apartment living may not be the best fit. This breed can be loving, loyal and very smart. \n\nThe above behaviors and personality traits have been observed while at the Shelter. If this animal was relinquished, information is gathered from the owner regarding behavior. Our wonderful volunteers spend time with these animals and give input on behaviors and traits. However, this description may not be all inclusive to how this animal will act in a loving forever home. Introduction to established family pets should be slow and monitored always. The same goes for children and other family members. Adopting a pet is a big decision and should be thoughtful. We suggest researching different breeds to match traits and personalities to your lifestyle. When adopting a pet, please know that this pet will be with you for their lifetime; patience and consistency will make for a successful adoption.\n Primary Color: Brindle Weight: 64.2lbs Age: 1yrs 2mths 0wks Animal has been Neutered",

I am here to show all of you humans that extraterrestrials are actually the most loving creatures you will ever come by <3 \n\nBecause my heart is so big, I am always overflowing with SO MUCH TO SAY! I'm a pretty little guy, but I've got a big voice! Don't worry, I know how to be quiet too... I just.. sometimes get a little nervous about being left alone.. So if you're a family that spends a good amount of time at home and you can spend some time helping me learn how to be brave on my own, I'm probably your perfect babe! Although I am small, compact and only 15 pounds, I am not suited for any apartment living. I will need a big enough Earth-ship with a yard and enough distance from your neighbors to accommodate this big personality. \n\nI'm pretty picky with other dogs, but not with my people! I love to love and to be loved. Not to toot my own horn or anything, but I did win the BEST CUDDLER award of 2021 ;) I cannot wait to meet the family that is going to rock my world and FINALLY give me my forever home. \n\nI can't wait to meet you! If you'd like to meet me, contact my friends at Lost Our Home by putting in a application with MY name on it!\n\n\nAll dog adoptions include the following:\n--Spay/neuter surgery\n--All current vaccinations\n--Microchip with free chip registration\n--Free wellness exam through VCA Animal Hospitals\n--Access to our Behavior Helpline for the lifetime of the pet\n \nFor more information or to schedule an appointment to meet this pet, please complete a Dog Adoption Questionnaire online. You can also email us at adoptions@lostourhome.org.",

Foster mom says I got the name because my first night with Merit, \u201cRhapsody In E Flat\u201d was what helped me settle down and relax. I may not be able to see but that surely doesn\u2019t slow me down. It may take a bit of bumping into things to figure out my way around\u2026but don\u2019t worry, it doesn\u2019t bother me one bit! Foster mom says I don\u2019t actually know that I\u2019m a big dog and she\u2019s right! I try to fit in all the tiny places. I love taking in all the smells and sounds in new surroundings. There is so much to explore with my nose. I\u2019ve heard the term \u201cSenior\u201d tossed around to describe me but I firmly believe age is just a number and I\u2019m just full of wisdom. I love getting attention from my humans and would love to have a patient home to work with me. Well, Symphony No. 1 just came on so I\u2019m going to go now. Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to learn my new surroundings. If you think we\u2019d be great together, reach out to the people at Merit and they can certainly help you!\n\nPlease fill out an adoption application here: https://www.meritpitbullfoundation.com/adoption-form\n\nOur adoption fee is $250.\n\n*All dogs receive the following prior to adoption: Distemper/Parvo Vaccine, Rabies Vaccination, Heartworm Test & Treatment (if needed) Spay/Neuter (no dog will ever be adopted out without being altered), and Microchip. *Puppies too young for rabies or final boosters will need to be vaccinated post-adoption at the expense of the adopter.\n*All adopters must be at least 21 years of age.\n*We will only place dogs with indoor ONLY homes.\n*A home visit and application are required prior to adoption.\n*We do check home owners insurance or with your landlord to ensure pit bull type dogs are accepted in your home or apartment.\n\nIMPORTANT: Many homeowner's insurance companies have breed blacklists or \"dangerous dogs\" lists which include, but are not limited to, pit bulls, American Pit Bull Terriers, American Staffordshire Terriers, Staffordshire Bull Terriers, Rottweilers, Dobermans, Akitas, American Bulldogs, Chows and wolf-hybrids and WILL NOT insure you if they reside in your home or may cancel your insurance if you add a dog of these breeds to your home. If you rent, landlords may also have these same breed restrictions due to their insurance policies. Please check your homeowner's insurance policy or ask your landlord regarding breed discrimination before submitting this application to adopt a pit bull type dog.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\nName: Garland\nDOB: 11/27/2018\nWeight: 42 Pounds\nAdoption Fee: $375\n\nJudy Garland is the happiest little pittie mix you've ever seen. We don't know much about her background, but she came up to Minnesota from an overrun shelter in Laredo TX. She may have already had puppies at some point, which is amazing, because she still acts like such a puppy herself. She hasn't let anything get her down. She takes what life gives her with a bounce and a wag. She brightens our home with her love for life and happy energy. Judy has an intensity that comes through in her fierce love, and her play style - best described as wild abandon. But she needs your love too, and will crawl up on your lap and kiss your face until you can't take it anymore, and then fall into a peaceful sleep, snoring away. Her love and trust for people around her, after the uncertainty in her life is nothing short of incredible.\n\nWhen you get up, she jumps up, ready for anything - \"what's our next adventure? I can't wait!\" She's curious about everything, and investigates anything new with courage and persistence. She loves her toys and bones and will entertain herself when there's no one around to try to coax into playing with her. When she finds a toy she likes, she positively prances with it over to her bed to give it all her attention. She plays hard with the Resident dogs, and holds her own, even though she's only half their size. But they are fuddy duddies and don't always appreciate being leapt on with such a lack of restraint. They are patient though, and are good sports. Sometimes playing with the big dogs is just so much fun, that she can't contain her excitement and needs a little help to disengage and take a little break. She's always responsive to this guidance and grateful to get a little rest on her own.\n\nJudy thinks little critters are pretty special and can think of nothing better than getting her paws around one of their little necks. That is, she has a high prey drive. The cat in the house has been banished to the basement when Judy is around, as he probably wouldn't be safe in her presence. She's very distracted by squirrels in the yard, and obsessed with the Cat through the baby gate.\n\nShe does really well playing with toys, and even chewing on bones with the Resident dogs, but you know how it is: sometimes there's that one special brand new something, and you just don't want it to be with anyone but you. So if one of the Resident dogs gets in her space when she has something super fantastic she has to let them know they've crossed the line. That is, she does some resource guarding. Any new bones, or high value treats or food are given in her crate or a separate room, and that keeps everyone safe and happy. She's more than happy to share with her foster mama and trusts her to only do what's best for her.\n\nShe walks on a leash, but will pull if there is something she wants to get after - squirrels, or other dogs she wants to play with or even an intriguing smell. We are working on that and a harness is helping tremendously. Potty training is going really well - she seems to signal by whining and pawing, but we are always working to understand her cues better.\n\nShe isn't in a crate for long periods during the day, but she does go in her crate easily for a few treats. She may whine a little at first, but settles down quickly and sleeps the hours away. She also sleeps through the night in a crate next to her foster mom's bed. It's always nice to have something to distract if she'll be left alone - a frozen kong or bone does the trick. She also does well if contained in a room on her own. If given the run of the house when left alone, she would probably get into trouble. Because of her curious nature, it's best to keep chewable items readily available, to deter her from the non-chewable items that might be lying around.\n\nJudy is a fantastic combination of sweet and sassy. She will wiggle her way into your heart and never leave. She plays hard, and she loves even harder. She will LOVE to have her own place to rule the roost, and her own people to love and snuggle with to her heart's content.\n\nThere's no place like home.\n\nAn adoption application is the best way to show your interest in an animal. Please check out our website, www.ruffstartrescue.org for more details and additional pictures on any of our animals! All Ruff Start dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, up to date on age appropriate vaccines, microchipped, dewormed, and on monthly flea/tick and heartworm prevention (dogs) as well as heartworm tested (dogs).

            "description": "UPDATE as of Feb 2nd: Because of considerable interest in this dog, we are no longer accepting new applications.\n\nPuppy sighs, trusting eyes, soft fluffy fur, cuddles, puppy kisses and the cutest belly you've ever seen... this is what I have to give you. I was just rescued by Second City Canine Rescue  and I'm now in a loving foster home waiting for my forever family to find me! Please come soon... I can't wait to meet you!\n\nInterested in adopting this dog? Visit our website (http://www.SecondCityCanineRescue.org) to fill out an application and to find out where this dog may be shown this weekend.\n\nWe love our dogs. We want happy lives for all of them and are looking for the home that provides the best fit for each dog\u2019s individual needs. Please understand that there may be multiple families interested in this dog. Come to the show to find out if this dog is the right fit for you \u2014 it's helpful to bring all family members and current dogs. \n\nAlso, please know that the breed mix listed is simply a guess. In most cases, we don\u2019t know their background. We encourage you to base your decision on individual personality and pet qualities instead of relying on our guess.\n\nPlease understand, we only adopt our animals out near the Chicagoland area. Questions? Email us at adoptions@sccrescue.org. Hope to see you become part of the SCCR family!",

            "description": "Meet Copper! He's a 7 year old coonhound mix with a gentle demeanor and an old soul. Copper probably toes the line between a medium & large sized pup weighing in at about 55 lbs. He's a very handsome dude with velvety soft fur, long floppy ears and soulful brown eyes. Copper loves walks & does okay on a lease, expert at fetch when he gets the itch and is low/med energy.\n\nCooper is housebroken, quiet (mostly) and can be left out of his crate unsupervised. He's been the only dog in his household for several years. Copper has been a SAAP dog since I was a puppy and got adopted - but I had to be returned based on interactions with a toddler in the household & would do best in a home without small children. Also, no cats please.\n\nCopper is a bit of a Nervous Nellie meeting strangers - no aggression, just timid. He'll need an adopter that can look past first impressions when they meet based on this shyness. Cooper truly is a lovable guy and a wonderful companion, he just needs a little bit of time to warm up.\n\nApply to adopt today!All SAAP animals are vet checked, UTD on vaccines, spayed/neutered, micro chipped, and given flea and heartworm preventative as age appropriate.\n\nOur website is: http://www.adoptastray.com/\n\nTo check if this animal is still available visit our master pet list on our website at:\nhttp://www.adoptastray.com/adoptable-animals/\n\nHave questions:\nPlease email us at saap@adoptastray.com for more information about this animal or to answer any questions you may have. You may also contact us at (859)391-1234.\n\nCompleting the online application when you find an animal you are interested in speeds up the adoption process. We can hold your application on file for a period of time if you are still looking for that perfect new family member.\n\nTHE APPLICATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS LINK:\nhttp://www.adoptastray.com/dog-adoption-application/\n\nINTERESTED IN FOSTERING:\nWe welcome your interest and ask that you complete our on-line foster application:\nhttp://www.adoptastray.com/foster-application/",

This handsome boy is fully trained - he knows all his basic commands and is very well-behaved. He walks great on leash, without pulling, and is good with dogs that he lives with - after he accepts them into his pack. However, Rex is not a dog to take to dog parks - he is a dominant dog, so any other dogs in his future home need to be ok with a dominant male.\n\nRex is housebroken, crate-trained and not destructive when left alone. He is very calm in the house and loves to hang out with his owner. He was purchased from a breeder when he was a puppy, but due to special circumstances in his family Rex now needs a new home.\n\nThe best type of home for Rex needs to meet the following objectives: \n- An adult-only home - no kids.\n- Someone who knows and understands protective breeds.\n- Since he has been owned by only one family, he needs a new owner who is patient, thus allowing Rex to take the time he needs in order to adjust to a new home and new people.\n- A house or a condo with a yard.\n- His future home needs to be outside of Los Angeles city, preferably in L.A. county.",

Once that happens he will be the most amazing and loyal friend. He would do best in a house with a fenced in yard where he can run and play ball. \n\nRocky needs a home who is willing to work with a positive reinforcement trainer- he gets nippy at time (probably the cattle dog in him) and can be pretty persistent. Until this behavior is taken care of he is looking for a home without kids! With a consistent routine and direction this behavior should subside quickly. Our trainer is happy to work with anyone interested in getting to know Rocky. This poor boy deserves his forever home. \n\nHe is house trained, crate trained, and very food motivated making him a good candidate for training!  \n\nOn walks, he is great when encountering people and walking past other dogs, even if they\u2019re barking at him. He does pull when he sees a particularly enticing squirrel (not all squirrels) but can be redirected. He has no interest in chasing anything else like birds. He is happy to calmly walk up and greet people on walks too!\n\nAdoption Fee is $150\nHe is up to date on vaccines and has had a wellness exam, heartworm tested and micro-chipped.\n\n In order to meet any of our dogs, please fill out an application. To fill out an application \ngo to http://caninehumane.org/adoption-application/ \n\nIF THE DOG IS ON PETFINDER THEN IT IS STILL AVAILABLE\n\nwww.caninehumane.org \n\n***BE SURE TO CHECK YOUR SPAM/PROMOTION EMAIL FOLDER FOR CHN RESPONSE TO YOUR APPLICATION***",

I used to love to go camping with my family and I love to play fetch with a ball or frisbee. I have some fear issues which causes me to be barky around new people, but I do settle down fairly quickly. The volunteers are working with me around other dogs to help me to not be fearful and barky. I will need a calm, confident adopter who will continue with my obedience and socialization. With my former family, I was affectionate, playful and protective. At this time, I may do best in a home rather than an apartment or condo. More info to come. My adoption fee is $350 and if you are interested, please submit an online application at adoptagsd.org.\n\nAlthough we do our best to keep our adoptable animals page as current as possible,the animals you see may already be in an adoption process.",

Update 1/7:  Braynard just loves getting love from his foster mom.  He walks very nicely on leash but does have some prey drive so a home with no cats is a must.

Basically it means the part of my brain that controls fine motor skills and muscle coordination didn't form fully.  As a result I run and walk a little wonky-- I kind of hop like a bunny.  But, don't let my funny bunny hop prevent you from adopting me.  I am a happy-go -lucky little dude who loves life and adores toys (especially rope toys!  Tug is my FAVORITE game and I'm really good at it!).   I love to play with other dogs and really hope that my furever home has at least one other doggy brother or sister for me.   A home with kids would be cool too.  Once I have warn myself out running and playing,  I really like snuggling with my person on the couch.   I am house-broken, crate-trained and up-to-date on my vaccinations. Because of my condition, it is recommended that I wait until 1 yr to be neutered. But, I will come with a voucher from Herding Haven to get that done once I am old enough.  If you are interested in meeting me please contact kathie@herdinghaven.org",

            "description": "Freddy is about 4 years old, under 50lbs, neutered, and healthy!!! \n\nHe's currently in Puerto Rico but can be flown to the Northeast US. Despite the trauma he's endured, he's energetic and playful! The only signs of the hardship he's faced in his life are his need for a little extra patience while he learns how to be a dog again and an adorable little wobble in his step.\n\nFreddy doesn't need a perfect person. He's just looking for someone to give him a safe and loving home where he can be his aloof, puppy-like self and do what he does best: love his life. He's a sweet boy who desperately deserves a best buddy for life! ?\n\nIf you're interested in adopting Freddy, please fill out an application at bit.ly/PSDAdopt\n\nKnow someone who looking to welcome an amazing dog into their life? Let them know about Freddy! \n\nHIT BY A CAR AND LEFT TO DIE! \n.\nIt's a miracle that we get to say these words:\n.\n?? Will you adopt Freddy? ??\n.\n.\nFreddy's rescue journey started in March 2020 when we got awful news about a dog in the streets of Puerto Rico. \n.\nThere's a dog that's been been hit by a car.\nHe's bleeding and motionless in the street.\nOur vet has agreed to open the clinic just for him.\nWe've given him a name: Freddy.\n.\nFreddy is in agonizing pain.\nFreddy's spine is fractured.\nFreddy's back legs are paralyzed.\nFreddy's front leg is severely broken.\nFreddy is positive for heartworm.\nFreddy isn't likely to survive. \n.\nBut Freddy had our hearts and we were all in. We didn't expect him to survive. We didn't expect him to walk. We didn't expect to share the miraculous news that we get to share with you today.\n.\nFreddy survived the night.\nFreddy survived the week!\nFreddy's surgery was successful!\nFreddy's legs might work again!\nFreddy can WALK!\nFreddy is done with heartworm treatment!\nFreddy is being discharged from the vet!\n.\nFinally, the words we fought so hard for but never imagined we'd actually be able to say:\n.\nFreddy is healthy and ready to find his forever home! \n\nIf they are listed on PetFinder, they have not yet been adopted. If you wish to meet them or find out more about them that is not included in their profile, please fill out our adoption application at http://bit.ly/PSDAdopt and our adoption counselor will contact you as soon as possible.",

            "description": "HI. My name is Faith and I am a 9 month old border collie.  I was born deaf and kept in a small kennel on a large cattle farm for the first 6 months of my life.  Luckily someone notified Herding Haven and I now live in a wonderful foster home while I wait to find my furever home. I am very shy and nervous around people I don't know because I had so little interaction with people during the first 6 months of my life.  I'm starting to learn to trust my foster mom and my sweet, snuggly and playful personality is beginning to come out. I really like other dogs.  They help me feel safe and more confident.  A home with another dog is a requirement for adopting me.  I like to chase cats and small/young children are too rambunctious and scary for me, so a home without cats and toddlers would be best. I am house-broken, crate-trained and learning to walk on a leash. My foster mom is teaching me sign language; I'm super smart and learn really fast! I am spayed and up-to-date on my vaccinations.  If you are interested in meeting me, please contact kathie@herdinghaven.org",

            "description": "Our sweet Journey has definitely earned her name! This 2 year old beauty has been through the wringer it seems in her short time spent with us. Journey arrived in our care as a stray and was very skinny, covered in fleas, and sadly pregnant. She quickly won over the heart of one of our staff members who opened up her home to this wiggly, happy girl. Her foster mom got her back on track with nutrition and helped her prepare to be a mother. Journey did deliver her puppies and unfortunately all were stillborn. It was incredibly heartbreaking for both Journey and her foster family. After a vet visit it was determined that Journey has a heart condition called Cardiomyopathy. She does not require medication for this, but her lifespan is unknown with her condition. Despite her physical heart difficulties, Journey is the biggest lover. She lives for attention and wants to be with her people as much as possible. She gets along well with other calm, cool dog friends and prefers a home without kitties. Since Journey was was so skinny and malnourished when she arrived in our care, she does have some issues with food and resource guarding. She will require being fed separately in a crate and needs a home without small children. Her foster mom reports she is crate and house trained and knows quite a few commands. Some of her favorite activities involve playing with toys and cuddling up with you on the couch. We know this special girl deserves a chance at forever, are you the perfect match?\n\nIf you're interested in meeting or adopting Journey, please complete an application at: inapl.org/adoption-application. Once it's processed, a member of our team will be in touch with you to schedule a meet and greet appointment. This is the time when you and all members of your household will come to our shelter to officially make your connection with Journey.\n\nJourney\nAmerican Bulldog/Boxer mix\nFemale\nDOB: 11/2/2018\nWeight: 69.4 lbs.\nHeartworm Negative",

This goofy guy will walk up to anyone, flop onto his back, and wait for some belly rubbin. Melo needs an experienced owner with a very active lifestyle or with the time to commit to burning off this boy's energy! He needs clear boundaries as he is still a pup, and a smart and high energy one at that! He enjoys hanging out in the front yard outside in the sun and sniffing around. He is good with doggos and doesn't meet a stranger! \n\nHe is very obedient and a fast learner...treats help :) It seems like every day he is mastering a new trick or command! Melo is a strong dog who needs a stronger handler to continue his training! No small kids or cats for this busy boy. He needs someone to keep him engaged through training; he'd be great as a working dog! \n\nHe will be your most loyal companion! Meet Melo today!",

She is super intelligent and a problem solver as in\u201d I want to go outside\u201d she will open the door and take off which does make her an escape artist. She is very sweet and loves to cuddle. She is a barker and will let you know if anything ( 4 or two legged) is near!  Pua has no health issues. No aggression issues, loves people, loves other dogs. She can be hyper when someone new comes over to the house. She has tons of energy. Housebroken, can be a counter surfer if she smells something that she wants. Pua does get extremely car sick.  A fenced in home would be best for Pua.\n\nAdoption fee is $425\n\nIf you do not hear from us within 7 days please email passion4petsrescue@gmail.com\n",

More details below.\n\n**During the current health situation**\n\nIf you are interested in ADOPTING from the EDISON ANIMAL SHELTER, please email the shelter manager, Becky Snyder at rsnyder@edisonnj.org and she will send you an application to fill out and discuss potentially setting up a meeting. The subject of the email should be \"Adoption - Pet's Name\". Thank you. Be safe and stay healthy.\n\nADOPT ME!  Say hello to ODIE. He is a gorgeous SWEETHEART who is probably under one year old. He is happy-go-lucky, fun and very, very energetic. He is bright-eyed and playful. \n\nOdie needs a home with a fenced yard and someone willing to take the time to give him the attention and training he so desperately needs. He is not the dog for you if you live in an apartment or condo without a yard that he can run in. \n\nThat being said, he really does love to be with people, so just putting him out in a yard alone will not work. He will just sit and wait for you to also come out and play with him. \n\nWith the training he needs, it may be best if he is the only dog in the home. But, if you do have another dog, it would have to be a dog that he can roughhouse with. He enjoys playing with other dogs that are his size and strength.\n\nAll of our shelter dogs and cats are spayed/neutered, microchipped and up to date on their vaccinations prior to adoption. \n\nFor our shelter updates, check out Friends of the Edison Animal Shelter Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/edisonanimalshelter\n\nTo view all of the Edison Animal Shelter's available pets on Petfinder (which includes pictures and bios), please click on the following link: https://www.petfinder.com/pet-search?shelter_id=NJ593\n\nInstagram\nhttps://www.instagram.com/edisonshelter/?igshid=1b8ab04w24mb6",

            "description": "Hi!! My name is Scooby and I am an 11 month old Catahoula Cur Mix who weighs approximately 40 lbs. I still need to put on some more weight and to fill out. Before I was rescued, I spent my days wandering the streets trying to get food and love from wherever I could find some. I saw my foster dad walking his dog and thought \u201chey he looks really nice\u201d so I followed him home and right inside. I have been fully vaccinated, house trained and know how to walk on a leash. I even know my \"sit\" command!\n\nMy foster mom says I have a sweet personality!! I am a little scared of other dogs because I had to fend for myself for so long, but I\u2019m not food aggressive. I love playing with toys and going for jogs.  When I\u2019m done playing, I love to curl up on my foster mom to cuddle. However, I do need to get my proper exercise and would love an active human who enjoys lots of walks, hikes and even runs. I see every fence as a chance to show how tall I can jump, so my foster mom supervises me when outdoors. I do have separation anxiety and would love to find an owner who works from home or has time to shower me with love. I also enjoy looking out the window and watching people walk by.  At night, I love cuddling up on my fuzzy blanket to fall asleep. I am ready for a forever home and I hope it will be with you!! I would do best in a home with older teens and where all humans in the home have a role in my care. A meet and greet with another dog would be best. Below is a description of my breed.\n\nThe Catahoula Leopard Dog is a medium-large, short-coated dog, known for its many varied coat and eye colors and patterns. The word catahoula is of Choctaw origin and is translated to mean \u201csacred lake.\u201d Catahoulas are the only breed of dog to have historically originated in the state of Louisiana. The breed requires firm guidance and early socialization, as they can be independent, territorial, and protective. For the same reasons, they do not allow mistreatment and will assert themselves in self-defense. Once they know their place in the family unit, they are affectionate, loyal, and gentle. Also called the Catahoula Hog Dog, they are used as stock dogs, bay dogs, tree dogs, watchdogs, guard dogs, and of course as loyal companions. \n\nAdoption fees details:\u00a0\nPuppies - Adults $ 550, Seniors $375. These adoption rates include transport from Alexandria, Louisiana to designated New England adopter pick up locations and NE foster homes using either Rescue Road Trips, Pets LLC or CAFA Transport. If you do a search you will see that this is a very reasonable adoption fee and comparable to other rescues.\u00a0Adoption\u00a0fee breakdown:Adoption Fee: \u00a0 $ \u00a0365.00Transportation Fee: \u00a0$ 185.00MA and NH only--Quarantine fee if applicable: \u00a0$125.00\n\nMedical details:\nAll our dogs are altered (spayed or neutered), DHLPP, rabies, Bordetella, Heartworm tested with negative test results, microchipped, treated for parasites and on monthly heartworm and flea and tick prevention. A health certificate is issued by a licensed Louisiana veterinarian.\n\nAdoption details:  \nIn some instances, a meet and greet is not possible before adoption unless we have a foster home in New England available. Available for a Meeting confirms the dog is in a NE Foster home and available for a meeting in the city state provided. \u00a0Most times our dogs get adopted before a foster home becomes available - and if so, they go straight to adopters home. Foster parents talk to adopters and feel confident that this will be a match before our dogs are transported up. Also if by some chance it is not a match we have a safety net in place as we ask that adopters to let us know that it is not a match and we direct you to take the dog to a foster home or boarding kennel once that is arranged. If necessary, we will ask you to foster the dog until a foster home can be arranged.\u00a0\nTransport details:Rescue Road Trips (rescueroadtrips.com), Pets LLC (petsllc.net) or CAFA Transport will deliver our precious pups on commercial rescue animal transport to designated locations. \u00a0The fee is 185.00 which IS INCLUDED in your adoption fee already.**Rescue Road Trips, was featured on The Today Show - view it at http://www.today.com/video/today/55034556#55034556\n\nMA and NH RESIDENTS:\nIf you are a Massachusetts or New Hampshire residence, an additional fee of $125.00 will apply due to State quarantine fee requirements. If the dog is in a foster home in MA or NH, this fee will be added in the adoption fee regardless of where the adopters home is located making the total adoption fee $675.00 for puppies and adults $500.00 for Seniors, otherwise the full adoption fee for all other states is $550.00 for puppies and adults and $375.00 for seniors. This includes a 48 quarantine, recheck by a MA licensed veterinarian, and issued a MA health certificate.\n\nVisit all our available dogs at www.cenlaallianceforanimals.comWe update and add dogs frequently.\n\nWe hope to help make a difference in a rescue dogs life into loving responsible homes.",

            "description": "Hi there - nice to meet you!  My name is STYX!   I am 4-5 months old and weigh in at 35 lbs. I still have some growing to do, but should stay in the medium size range.  I\u2019m a pit bull mix and my foster mom says the brown specks on my ears and nose make me super cute.    \n\nI was on a road wandering with another puppy when when a kind rescue lady pulled up with her van.  We were hungry and scared so we jumped right in because we knew we that life would get better from there....and it did!   For a while, I was sick with with Parvo - that\u2019s a bad puppy illness - but with good vet care and lots of TLC from my fosters, I got all better and am now a healthy, happy pup ready for my new home in the New Year!\n\nAn important thing you should know about me is that I am hearing impaired.  Some might call it a disability, but It is normal for me cuz\u2019 it\u2019s what I have always known!   If my new family can give me some special training with hand signals, I know I\u2019ll become the best dog ever!  Everyone tells me that deaf dogs live happy lives and bond well with their humans and I cannot wait to meet my special new family!  If they have had experience with a dog that with a disability, that would be perfect!   \n\nMy foster mom says I am a very sweet boy.  I really do love my people!  I'm still young and have plenty of puppy mischief in me, but some training will help me to learn all my manners!   I get along well with the dogs in my foster home. Sometimes I can be a little protective of my food around other dogs  (not humans) so just something to know if another dog is in my new home.  I like kids a lot and enjoyed meeting the older children that came to visit.   My rescue thinks my best home will be an adult/teen one because my puppy playfulness may be a little much for young children.  Older kids could also help with my training and understand my unique needs!  My foster mom says a reline free home would probably be best for me!  I am learning the ropes of house and crate training and my new family can help me finish that up.  A consistent routine and positive reinforcement will help us get it down pretty quick! I love my people and sometimes get a little barky when we are separated - so I would love a home where folks are not gone all day. \n\nI have been neutered and am up to date on my vaccines. I am also micro-chipped and on flea-tick and heartworm preventative.  If you love pitties and have the time and experience for a pup like me, I know we\u2019ll be great pals.  I have years of loyalty and devotion to give you.   Please email Chris at rescue3@earthlink.net  and she will zip an application out to you!  My adoption fee is $350.\n\nLike us on Facebook at www. facebook.com/pawsclawsnewengland\nFollow/tag us on Instagram: @pawsclawsne or #pawsclawsne\n\n\n",

I'm a sweet, rambunctious boy who loves to play fetch, as well as tug-of-war. I need a home that'll give me an outlet for all my energy! I can play all day at daycare, take a half hour nap, then am ready to race and wrestle with my dog foster siblings until I wear them out and have to go to the humans to throw the ball. I'd be perfect to get into doggy sports, like dock diving or fly ball; I'd also make an excellent running partner! I get along well with all my doggo foster brothers and sisters (who are my size and larger). I'm not a fan of those kitty things, though. I go in my kennel to eat my meals, and like to sleep with my \"big\" dog siblings all night. I am also looking for a comfy couch, and would like to rest my head on your lap. If you're energetic and want a fun guy to hang out with, please, fill out an application so we can meet, and let the fun begin! ...",

            "description": "Meet Atti:\n\nAtti is a ~1.5 yr old, neutered male Anatolian Shepherd mix believed to be a farm dog when he lived in Iran. While aspects of Atti's looks tell a story of trauma - his temperament reflects anything but.  For a boy who had never lived inside a home or had people treat him well, he's quickly adjusted to living in a whole new world like a rock star.\n\nThis incredibly regal boy is stoic, friendly, calm, gentle, quick to bond, and even quicker to steal hearts with his casual and understated offer of \"paw\" when you least expect it. He's a great communicator and will go get his leash for you if you forget it's time to go for a walk.  Forget to put his bed outside?  He'll grab a towel and take it outside so he has a comfy spot to lay in the sun and watch over his kingdom.  He instinctively knew that the bathroom belongs outside, and has never had an accident in the house.\n\nHe enjoys the company of other dogs, understands and wholly embraces the couch potato concept and is a very pleasant walking companion (Atti needs only a moderate level of exercise as a former leg injury precludes him from long hikes and runs). Atti enjoys children and looks forward to the supplemental care he receives from his foster's 11 yr old neighbor.  He's the perfect combination of calm and playful.\n\nAtti's huge hearted rescuer worked with a group of s/hero's to transport him from Iran to the US. He is nearing a clean bill of health (receiving medication for a bladder infection). The ideal home for Atti would be a home with another dog as he and Tucker, his foster's dog, quickly became BFFs and the joy of watching them play is priceless. Any family lucky enough to adopt this boy will be blessed with a special sentient being (NOTE: we love all dogs...and well...this boy is pretty special). Please contact us if you are interested in hearing more about Atti.\n\nHINT: Atti is the large dog with spots on his nose in the pics and videos\n\nLink to video: https://youtu.be/bwg_RPynMzQ\n\nContacts:\nKit O'Doherty, kitodoherty@gmail.com, (650) 274-5236 c\nChris Guio, cguio1@yahoo.com, (650) 438-0617 c",

Found by a group of good Samaritans in November...they called the shelter to report finding a stray and gave him a name...because that\u2019s where he was found...by the river. \nHis picture upon intake is hard to look at- only 20 pounds (less than half of his ideal weight).  Shelter staff started a feeding program to safely add weight to his emaciated frame and look at him now!  He\u2019s had quite a journey but he\u2019s now a healthy 45 pounds, loves his toys and especially his blankets and bed.  \nRiver is hoping to find a loving family to call his very own and to start the new year with only good things ahead....including never having to worry about his next meal again. \nHe\u2019s a fella with lots of love to give. Please send an email to adoptions@wbrcouncil.org if you are interested in adopting River.",

            "description": "Meet Telemachus! Are you his Odysseus? In Greek mythology, Telemachus relentlessly searched for his father, Odysseus, as family meant everything to him. However, when you have four paws, it's really better to let the humans do the searching, so Telemachus is focusing on smaller battles with goals he can obtain! Those have taken place in his structured foster home! Specifically, he has conquered the battle of playing appropriately with his foster (human) mom. He realized treats are delicious, and since he's so smart, he is learning very quickly that using good manners means lots of tasty morsels and positive attention from his human. He has even learned that if he simply sits or shakes he can earn a treat for that as well and performs gladly. Other commands he is eagerly learning are: stay, leave-it and off. Telemachus loves a treat, but he doesn't discriminate and loves doggie chow too. Telemachus longs for his father, but would really enjoy doggie siblings who enjoy a fun romp around the yard! And humans who share his desire for adventure and will invite him along! While he waits and trusts his foster mom to find his father, you better believe he is enjoying relaxing in a soft and cozy doggie bed because he is that perfect combination of playful pup and couch potato. E-mail foster@kcpetproject.org to meet him!",

            "description": "If this nice boy interests you we ask that you go to www.jcldr.com and put in an application for him first, that gives us a feel for you and yours. The meet and greet is always last and no one is obligated to adopt by putting in an application \n\nSTATS: Coal is an approximately 1.5 years old Catahoula mix.  He is neutered and crate broke. He runs in to his crate as soon as he knows it is time for food and will regularly hang out in there when it is open. He likes to chew on an antler and will play fetch but has a short attention span. Coal is housebroken but has peed in the house a few times when he has been excited (e.g. new visitors).  He is fully vaccinated and is microchipped. Coal weighs approximately 60 pounds.  He is fed Taste of the Wild Pacific Stream (Salmon) twice a day.  Coal does well with nail trims but thinks it is a game and will try to nibble on your hands or the trimmer or pull his feet away so he can paw at you to instigate play; I\u2019ve found he does best with one or two feet at a time, a play break, and then try again. He does well with veterinarian visits as far as I can tell (it is curbside pick-up only here, but I have not heard anything negative). He has thrown up once on a car ride, but it was on twisty, windy mountain roads, so he may not always vomit in the car. Coal has been doing well walking on a leash. We have used a Martingale collar for training, and he is responding well to not pulling while on the leash and heeling beside me while we walk. He is quite mouthy still  and that is typical puppy stuff, he thinks it is always time to play. Coal has not been around children while in foster, but given his playful, rambunctious nature, he may do best with older children (he does not seem to realize his size and I could see him accidentally knocking a small child over). He is a very smart boy and picks up on things quickly; he makes good eye contact and wants to please people and be told he\u2019s a \u2018good boy\u2019.  He gets along well with my other 3 dogs (two males and one female). He loves to play and run in the yard, so another dog friend could be great for him. He has not been around cats or small animals while in foster, but he seems interested in the wild turkeys outside the fence (I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019d chase or catch them if left to his own devices).\n\nHISTORY: Coal was picked up by the shelter as a stay, so there is no previous known history.  He has been in foster for about 6 weeks now and has shown himself to be a very well-adjusted boy. He picks up on cues and commands quickly and has figured out the routine of the household. \n\nGOOD: Coal is a sweet, loyal boy. He loves to cuddle and have his belly rubbed. When I arrive home from work, he is wiggly and bendy coming out of his crate, so excited to see me, greet me and get attention. At bedtime he will jump right on the bed ready for his nightly cuddle before going to sleep. He is a great companion for a hike/walk.  He walks well on a leash but would probably pull if something caught his attention.  He likes to sit on your feet whenever he can and enjoys being (very) near his people. He follows me everywhere like a shadow.  He loves catching ice cubes if they fall on the ground from the automatic dispenser in the refrigerator (if he hears the ice dispenser making noise, he comes running from wherever he is!). He enjoys playing with toys (with me and/or the other dogs) and loves having the freedom to explore around the fenced in yard. He does not bark very often, but he does bark excitedly when there are turkeys in the yard.  He has his moments of being hyper and playful, but then others where he is very mellow and enjoys just sitting on the couch with you. He would do well with another dog or as the only dog. Another dog friend should enjoy playing rough, though, as Coal can get pretty rowdy which is typical of Catahoulas.. Coal is very intelligent and picks up on commands quickly. He is very treat motivated (I use pieces of his dog food as treats), which makes training him fairly easy.  He makes good eye contact and is very, very focused when you ask him to do something. He is a very smart boy and picks up on things quickly. \n\nBAD: He is mouthy still and will bite and nibble (playfully) when you pet him, which might not be a good fit for younger children until he learns not to do that. \n\nUGLY: He seems selective about male dog friends when there is a lot going on around him. He once got into a fight with one of my dogs (my dog instigated it because Coal was playing roughly with one of my other dogs). Coal initially did not respond, but he was amped up from playing and when my dog (male) inserted himself into the mix, Coal reacted. Both dogs immediately stopped when squirted with water from a pop-top water bottle, and they have had no issues since. Coal also attacked a smaller male dog; once again, he seemed to be overstimulated and eventually went from being playful to becoming aggressive; he again responded to the pop-top water bottle.when applied properly.  \n\n",

            "description": "***AVAILABLE FOR ADOPTION AT OUR FLORIDA LOCATION***\n\nEmily is a female Heeler mix. She is around 3 years old and weighs approximately 35 lbs. She is very sweet, gentle and loving. She has Heeler energy.  A Heeler/herding dog savvy household would be helpful.\n\nEmily was found down a dirt road living under an abandoned house with her litter of puppies. She was bringing her pups lizards to eat because that\u2019s all she could find.  This girl has not had an easy road but worked hard to raise her babies and keep them safe on her own until we stepped in to help her. As you can see, she is partially blind in one eye due to a cataract, but she doesn't let it hold her back. \n\nEmily, like so many of our adults and mommas that come in, is heartworm positive. This is NOT contagious and is not a death sentence! We have started her on heartgard which will keep new worms from growing and allow the ones already present to die off slowly. This is the safest way to do it in the group home setting. Included in her adoption is a year supply of Heartgard. \n\nShe is currently living with a foster and is housetrained, travels well in the truck and golf cart, walks well on a leash, and is good mannered.  She is good with other dogs. She is good with kids too, though probably not a good mix with very young children. \n\nEmily deserves a family to love her and give her all the things she has never had! \n\nEmily is available in Bonifay, Florida through the rescue efforts of The Lucky Puppy Rescue. The minimum $250 adoption fee includes spay/neuter surgery, vaccinations, de-worm, flea prevention, heartworm prevention and martingale safety collar. Adoption fee payment methods accepted are credit, debit, Paypal and bank checks. No personal checks or cash. Applications must be submitted through our website - theluckypuppy.org - thank you! You may copy and paste the following link to apply: http://www.theluckypuppy.org/adoption-application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I came to LPDR when my owner became sick and went into longterm care. My Forever Home needs to be filled with loving and patient females who are home most of the time and do not have other dogs or cats. I love being on the couch and sleeping in my foster mom's bed. I am too short to get on the bed on my own and I don't like the stairs she got for me, but if I could, I'd stay under the covers all day! I don't really like sweaters so when we go outside I try to be quick. My foster mom has learned that I only like female people and I am protective of my people once I bond with them. No males, and no children in my forever home please. I love chewing on my stuffed animals and playing with my foster mom. I have to bring my toys to bed with me so my new people should have a big bed! I get a little worried when we go in the car but I like when we go to the beach or get a treat at Dunkin. I am house trained, but no crates for me. I enjoy going on walks, but would love a fenced yard!\n\nIf you want to know more about me, send an email to foster mom Shelly at shelly.davis579@gmail.com\n\nHoney's Adoption fee is $325. If she is adopted over a state line there will be a $45.00 charge for a health certificate (required by law).",

I\u2019m a very handsome 9 month old pup looking for a good home who will be patient with me. There is this thing called a pandemic going on (I don\u2019t know what that is but I guess it\u2019s a big thing) and I didn\u2019t get to explore a lot of places as a puppy...so new things are hard for me. I warm up eventually to people and to dogs but I\u2019ll need some help and guidance. I know I can be a great family dog because I would do anything for my people.\n\nI\u2019ve got some basic obedience training under my belt and I\u2019m very smart. If you are a family looking for a guy like me then reach out to Merit and we can see if it\u2019s meant to be! \n\nPlease fill out an adoption application here: https://www.meritpitbullfoundation.com/adoption-form\n\nOur adoption fee is $350 for puppies WITH a $100 REFUND with proof of training.\n\n*All dogs receive the following prior to adoption: Distemper/Parvo Vaccine, Rabies Vaccination, Heartworm Test & Treatment (if needed) Spay/Neuter (no dog will ever be adopted out without being altered), and Microchip. *Puppies too young for rabies or final boosters will need to be vaccinated post-adoption at the expense of the adopter.\n*All adopters must be at least 21 years of age.\n*We will only place dogs with indoor ONLY homes.\n*A home visit and application are required prior to adoption.\n*We do check home owners insurance or with your landlord to ensure pit bull type dogs are accepted in your home or apartment.\n\nIMPORTANT: Many homeowner's insurance companies have breed blacklists or \"dangerous dogs\" lists which include, but are not limited to, pit bulls, American Pit Bull Terriers, American Staffordshire Terriers, Staffordshire Bull Terriers, Rottweilers, Dobermans, Akitas, American Bulldogs, Chows and wolf-hybrids and WILL NOT insure you if they reside in your home or may cancel your insurance if you add a dog of these breeds to your home. If you rent, landlords may also have these same breed restrictions due to their insurance policies. Please check your homeowner's insurance policy or ask your landlord regarding breed discrimination before submitting this application to adopt a pit bull type dog.",

            "description": "Breed: Border Collie mix\nSex: Neutered Male\nDOB: ~12/15/2019\nWeight: 54 lbs\nEnergy Level: High\nPersonality Type: Talkative, People-Oriented, Energetic\nHistory: Transferred from another shelter\nGood With: Dogs but is a little picky, Kid 8+ years\nFence Requirements: Required!\nIdeal Home: Active home! No apartments, please! Please do research on this breed before adopting!\nSpecial Info:\n\nThe information we are providing for this animal was developed based on observations and assessments in a shelter or foster environment. We do our best to provide information that will help determine if the dog might be a good fit for you. Please note that behaviors may change in a home environment. We also ask our applicants to assume that any animal they adopt from us will need to be potty trained and learn house manners, although this is not always the case. Our online animal bios are designed to provide as much information as possible and answer some anticipated questions. We do not have the resources to respond to emails with more specific questions.\n\nWe are receiving an unusually high number of applications per pet at this time! Please follow the rules below to ensure your application is reviewed; pay attention closely to these instructions because applications will NOT be processed if they are not followed. Please keep in mind that dog/cat availability is currently changing by the hour; you will receive an email if the animal you are interested in is no longer available. New dogs become available almost every day, so feel free to let us know if someone else interests you if your initial choice is already adopted! \n\nFill out the application (DOG: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IHD-DOG-Application-9-10-18.pdf, CAT: https://www.iheartdogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IHD-CAT-Application.pdf) completely. Every question must be answered, and it must be signed. If you are going to type your responses, open the application, save it, type your answers, and save it again. \n\n-Applicants must be 21+ years old and live within a 50-mile radius of our shelter at 22415 Groesbeck Hwy, Warren 48089.\n\n-You must identify at least 1 dog/cat that you are interested in. If there are multiple dogs/cats, number them in order of priority. \n\n-Scan a copy of proof of home ownership (i.e. tax bill, deed, or mortgage payment - you can black out the account #, etc.) or animal clause/agreement of your rental agreement.\n\n-Attach the application and home ownership proof/rental agreement animal clause to a new email and send it to bark@iheartdogs.org. The subject line must be formatted to read \"\"#1 choice of dog/cat, Your First and Last Name\"\". Example: Subject: Fido, Jane Doe\nOnce your application is received, it will be assigned to an Adoption Counselor who will follow-up with the applicant who is the best fit within a few days, or to discuss other dogs/cats. It could take up to a couple of weeks for you to receive a final disposition on your application so there is no need to check on the status.\n\n-Introductions will be scheduled by appointment only, 45 minutes per appointment. The entire household, including current dogs, must be present for the appointment. The introductions will take place outside in our parking lot.\n\n-We will continue to perform vet checks for current and prior pets in the household.\n\n-Home visits will be in person for the yard and virtual for inside the home.\n\n-Finalizing the adoption will also be scheduled by appointment.\n\nWhile this process may seem cumbersome, it is interim during COVID-19, and it is designed to help us respond to the volume of emails we receive every day. Since we are receiving a high volume of applications, please be patient if a dog/cat is no longer available. \n\nThank you for your understanding.",

Here is what his handler had to say about him after taking him out on an adventure:\n\n\nToot Toot is a jovial \"BIG BOY\" who is also a very well behaved passenger. No complaints about my driving. I don't think he even licked my windows, he just quietly enjoyed the scenery as we drove up the mountain. He and I sat and looked out at a beautiful view of the valley.\n\nToot is a snuggly \"leaner\". When he throws his full weight into you, it's best to be sitting down. He knows SIT but usually drops from SIT straight down into a crazy roll which he seriously enjoys. He has a REALLY BIG head and very small ears. I checked to see if they had been cropped but his ears are just SMALL. No judgement. Just an observation. And while I am NOT body shaming him, his tail is not long and it's not short. It's half a tail. All of his physical \"quirks\" make him that much more handsome. AND HE KNOWS IT!\n\nToot likes toys. He had his eye on a pink teddy bear and wanted to bring it back to the shelter with him. He is good on a leash, he loves hiking and exploring, and seemed grateful for his day out. Toot is SUCH A GOOD BOY!\n\n\nWe're open Wednesday - Sunday 12 - 5 p.m but are doing meet & greets and adoptions by appointment only.  \n\nThe adoption fee is $90 which includes a free veterinary exam within 2 weeks of adoption at local participating vets, up to date vaccinations, heartworm test,  heartworm preventative, dewormer, flea preventative, microchip, & spay or neuter.\n\nIf you are interested in this pet, please fill out our ADOPTION APPLICATION at https://goo.gl/forms/9FdDBiPU5aa5ySTv1\n\nVisit our website at www.PetPlacementCenter.com",

            "description": "Rex is a neutered male shepherd mix. He is about 2 years old. He came to the shelter as a stray, so his history is unknown.\n\nWhen meeting new people, or seeing strangers, Rex is extremely nervous and anxious. This is referred to as stranger danger. When on a walk, he may pull and jump about. He is difficult to walk, and loses focus easily. When Rex is uncomfortable, it can be challenging to get him back to a calm state. Under stress, Rex is vocal. He reacts the same way to other dogs. In a more comfortable environment, and with people he knows and trusts, he can be his true self and is friendly, playful, and energetic.\n\nRex wants to learn and is quite intelligent. He is food motivated and has already learned some basic skills. It is required he goes to professional private dog training classes to sharpen up his skills and to help him create a bond with his family. Rex loves to burn his energy by running around and playing with soft-textured toys like ropes and plushies. Rex is looking for a home without any other pets, including dogs, cats, and small animals. He would not enjoy going to a dog park and would not be a candidate for that kind of environment.\n\nRex's home should have experience owning and working with large breed dogs. They should be active and excited to spend lots of time each day exercising Rex and working on his training. He must be adopted by an adult-only household (18+) without any other pets. A single-dwelling home would be best (no apartments or condos). He is not recommended for first time dog owners.\n\nRex is eating a special diet called Royal Canin Digestive Diet. This food has helped Rex with his sensitive stomach. He should stay on this diet unless a veterinarian suggests otherwise.\n\nDo you have the perfect home for Rex? Please submit a Dog Adoption Application to the Adoptions department.\n\nhttps://omhs.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/OMHS-AdoptionApplication-Dog.pdf\n\nYou may submit your completed adoption application by placing it in our drop dox to the left of the shelter doors, by emailing it to adoptions@omhs.ca, or by faxing it to 905-845-1973. The adoption application must be submitted for a particular animal.\n Primary Color: Tri Color Weight: 33.2kg Age: 2yrs 0mths 1wks Animal has been Neutered",

            "description": "Hello, my name is Ky! I am new to the shelter! I was surrendered because my family was no longer able to care for me. My previoius family reports that I do not get along with other animals. I also prefer males more than females. I have never been around children. I have a tendency to guard toys. I can be a nervous dog and should probably go to an experienced home who is willing to give me time to settle in and will be dedicated to my continued training. Please keep checking my profile for updates as the staff gets to know me better! If this dog has been successful in our play groups it is not a guarantee that a dog will be social with other dogs in their home or in public settings. Dogs are individuals and have personality conflicts, just like us. Play groups do not guarantee that territorial or resource guarding issues will not surface in the home. While play groups do help us get to know the dog's better, once they are adopted their new environments and new relationships will influence their behavior in ways we cannot predict. The Adoption Fee Includes: - initial canine distemper combination vaccination - first worming or stool check - rabies vaccination (for animals over 3 months of age) - AVID microchipping - flea treatment/preventative - spaying or neutering Adoption fee: $135.00 Per state law, ALL ADOPTERS must purchase a non-refundable 2021 dog license at time of adoption for any canine three months and older. The cost of the license is $7.00. (Senior Citizen or Person with Disability-$5.00) Leash and collar included",

She loves to chase shadows and lasers so it\u2019s very easy to exercise her. A home with experience with deaf dogs would be a huge plus! She\u2019s easily trained and learns a new routine in one day, she just needs some dedication. The best part is she sleeps through any scary sounds dogs tend to have issues with like fireworks and vacuums!!\n\nShe does super well with other dogs, meeting them and playing with them \u2014 but has not done well living with any dogs longer than about a month so does she need a home where she\u2019ll be an only fur child. \n\nOlder kids are great, no little kids and no cats. Crate trained, leash trained, microchipped, spayed and house broken. 5 classes at Sunny Day Acres where she is being fostered are included in her adoption fee (they love her that much!)\n\nThis is a courtesy post on behalf of Sunny Day Acres. The adoption fee is $450. Our team at Big Love will vet and forward all qualified applicants to our partners at Sunny Day. If you\u2019re chosen you will hear from us!\n",

            "description": "Meet the Firecracker Pups! These dazzling Shepherd and possibly Labrador mixes are sure to make your heart burst with their cuteness! They are 2 months old and looking for forever families to have a blast with! Their mama, Firecracker, is a beautiful Shepherd mix who is on the large side at 60 lbs. We aren't sure who dad is so we don't know what all these sweeties are mixed with, but they seem to be on track to be large dogs when full grown. Sparkler is looking for a family that understands the time, patience, and energy needed to raise a young pup. We require all puppy adopters to provide training that includes: house training, basic training, leash training, and socialization. Additionally, this cutie is going to need proper exercise, mental stimulation, and your attention and love to grow up to be the best companion. We do not allow our dogs or puppies to sleep or live outside; they must be incorporated into your family and be made a priority in your life. In return, you will have the most loving and loyal family member you could ask for. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting a puppy, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! Please note that processing time for applications is currently three to four weeks. We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs. Thank you for rescuing.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue. Please take a moment and go to www.labsandmore.org and click on Adopt to complete our online dog adoption application. If you have any questions email us at doginfo@labsandmore.org or call us at 858-273-5386. Thank you for looking to a rescue group to fulfill your dream of adding a new dog to your life!

            "description": "Meet Douglas! He is around 9 years young and is an Australian Shepherd mix. He enjoys and asks for attention from people and gets along with other dogs as long as they don't continually get all up in his personal space too much. He would do better with quieter, easygoing dog friends, but does not need a dog companion at home. Douglas knows many basic commands including Sit, Shake & Come. In his current foster home, he also uses the dog door, is completely house trained and walks well on a leash. He is fostered with older children and loves them, but young children might be a bit much for him. Douglas loves a good belly scratch, enjoys a nice stroll around the neighborhood, smelling the Roses each day and is looking for a loving forever family in his later years. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting Douglas, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for the next steps. Your interest in adopting a rescued dog or puppy from Labs and More Rescue is appreciated! Please find our adoption information at www.labsandmore.org. Your adoption donation provides funding for Labs and More, a nonprofit organization which is supported solely by Volunteers and funded by donations. Good news is your adoption donation can be considered tax deductible. So much care is provided to your new dog prior to the adoption, including: spay and neuter, microchip, veterinarian visit(s), vaccinations, and other medical care as needed. Many of the dogs we rescue require extensive surgeries and care prior to adoption. Please understand we are unable to predict future behavior or medical needs of your adopted dog. We provide no guarantees regarding behavior, breed, or age of the dogs. Thank you for rescuing.Thank you for looking to Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue. Please take a moment and go to www.labsandmore.org and click on Adopt to complete our online dog adoption application.

She was eventually spotted running and hiding while holding up one of her back legs and not wanting to use it. Presumably she had been hit by a car, but wouldn't let anyone get close to help. Eventually one of our own volunteers managed to successfully trap her so we could get her the medical attention she needed. We were able to save the leg and treat her heartworm. She's doing much better now and loves the girls at the vet clinic where she received her treatment. She's still wary of strangers, but just needs some time to get to know you. She's very sweet and affectionate once she gets past her initial shyness.",
