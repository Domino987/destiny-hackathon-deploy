She came to us from Southern WV a few weeks ago, but had a bit of an upper respiratory infection so she could not be cleared for foster at that time.. Winnie did well in boarding in Jefferson County NY, and she is now doing great, but needs to find a foster or foster to adopt to help show her the ropes. Winnie is very friendly, very active and seems to get along with most dogs very well. She does seem to have a high prey drive for smaller animals, however, and on leash will try to chase birds, squirrels and smaller animals so we are looking for a home for her with no cats or pocket pets. She needs help with basic obedience and would do best in a home familiar with Weimaraners or other hunting breeds so that she can get the training and exercise that she needs. This poor girl was dumped in a common dumping ground for dogs at a mine in WV, let's show her that not all humans are bad and her life IS worth saving!\n\nPlease copy and paste a completed adoption application from our homepage with your inquiry if you would like a response back. We get dozens of emails and phone calls each day with only an hour of \"free time\" to volunteer and answer them around our full-time jobs and family life...don't let your inquiry get passed by because of an incomplete application. Thanks in advance for your help!\n\nHelp our rescue by donating to our \"Spay the momma fund\". When adopting one of our babies, if each new family would contribute an extra $10 we can help out that babies mother by assisting with the cost of her spay. Help turn the momma into a pet rather than a breeding factory, donate today! \n\nAdoptions limited to a 500 mile radius of Pulaski, NY and pets must be viewed in person by all family members prior to adoption; animals will not be shipped to their new homes. Veterinary reference check and adoption donation also required. Check out our homepage for a full list of our adoption requirements.",

Stay tuned for more information as Patience is a new rescue!\n\nIf you are interested in fostering or adopting Patience please fill out an Application at\n\nwww.Passion-4-Paws.org\n\n(please make sure you have the Vermont site not CT) - thanks!\n\nPlease note Fosters have 1st option of Adoption.\n\nCheck out her Facebook page (please \"Like\" us while you are there)!\n\nDisclosure:\n\nBreed labels are often incorrect: we rarely know the genetic lineage of the dogs we rescue. Many shelters and rescues specify breeds based on appearance; however, research has shown that less than 2% of a dog's DNA determines appearance!\n\nPassion 4 Paws does not practice the use of labels pertaining to compatibility with others or dog breed. Labels such as \"dog friendly\" and \"child friendly\" should be used with caution as they often over-simplify the personalities and behavior of dogs.",

Australian Sheep Dog/ Corgi mix, or an Aussie-Corgi or Augi. She's totally housebroken, a mix of cuddly mush & explosive energy. She likes to run, chase thrown toys, or get as close to you as she can & nap. She expresses herself by lots of kisses. She also barks in excitement when she meets new friends, or if she's startled by sirens & other loud noises. When lights go out and it's time for bed, she sleeps through the night a good 8 hours. Raya is current on her vaccines and is microchipped. Raya will need a proper/slow introduction to other pets. She does startle easily and is unsure of new things. She is going to need patience to help her be her best self.",

Due to Dossie's shyness, she cannot go to a home with children and would do best in a quiet environment.

Here is her video in NC:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/JR4Z7IAA8sM\n\nMina is 2 years old (approx. DOB tbd), female, 47 lbs., vetted, is or will be spayed, and micro-chipped. Mina was abandoned at the shelter by her family for being too active!? She gets along well with other dogs, takes treats gently, enjoys playing with balls and being brushed! Mina takes a little while to warm up to new situations. Stay tuned for more information as Mina is a new rescue!\n\nIf you are interested in fostering or adopting Mina please fill out an Application at\n\nwww.Passion-4-Paws.org\n\n(please make sure you have the Vermont site not CT) - thanks!\n\nPlease note Fosters have 1st option of Adoption.\n\nCheck out her Facebook page (please \"Like\" us while you are there)!\n\nDisclosure:\n\nBreed labels are often incorrect: we rarely know the genetic lineage of the dogs we rescue. Many shelters and rescues specify breeds based on appearance; however, research has shown that less than 2% of a dog's DNA determines appearance!\n\nPassion 4 Paws does not practice the use of labels pertaining to compatibility with others or dog breed. Labels such as \"dog friendly\" and \"child friendly\" should be used with caution as they often over-simplify the personalities and behavior of dogs.",

I'm originally from Florida, around 1 year old (2 in a couple months), about 42 pounds, and I'm all set to move right into your heart & home today - already spayed, microchipped & up to date on vaccinations. \n\nThey didn't pull my name out of thin air - the staff have learned that I'm a super sweet gal. I'm also a pro at taking treats gently (cheese is my favorite!), and I've mastered sit, down, paw and high five. I love my outside time, taking walks with and hanging out with my humans.\n\nAs much as I love my PAC people, I'm really looking forward to finding my forever family. The staff think that I'll thrive with a family who has owned dogs previously and where the kids are 15 & older.\n\nThe staff would love to match you with your new best friend forever - and hopefully that's me! If you are interested in meeting me in person, please schedule an appointment here: ProvidenceAC.org/AdoptADog. Can't wait to meet you very soon! XOXO Sweetheart\"\n\n-------\nDuring your appointment, you will be able to meet a selection of pets in the Kennels or Cattery that day. New pets are arriving daily!\n-------\n\nProvidence Animal Center relies on adoption fees and donations to save pets! Adoption fees vary per pet. To find out this pet\u2019s adoption fee or for more information, please call the Adoption Center with this pet\u2019s ID number.\n\nCan\u2019t adopt? Consider fostering or donating!

I like spending time with my people and getting pets and treats. I've lived with children though they need to understand that I'm bigger than I think I am so I might knock them down. If you're up for a big, fun, guy to share your life, couch, and home with you should apply for me today. I'm ready to float off to my new home anytime.....\n\nIf you are interested in meeting any of our adoptable dogs, please fill out an application.

            "description": "Missy is a tiny pocket pointer who came to us last month from a small shelter near Corpus Christi. She may be small, but she makes up for that with her happy, spunky personality. \n\nShe loves people, is supper sweet, and is great with dogs once she warms up to them. She will need slow intros at first, and a little time to decompress, but then warms up and loves to play. She is crate trained, and enjoys exploring. She does have a high prey drive, so we don\u2019t recommend a home with cats. \n\nWant to adopt this sweet girl?  Visit canerossorescue.org to apply. She is currently being fostered in the Houston area, so this might be a great chance for anyone there to meet her more easily.\n\nThanks for considering a Cane Rosso Rescue dog! \nWe place dogs mostly in Texas but have adopted out a few out-of-state as well.\n \nIf you are interested in one of our dogs, please first complete our adoption application.\nYou can find it at https://www.canerossorescue.org/adoption-application . Her adoption fee is $300 plus tax. Our dogs are spayed or neutered, microchipped, vaccinated and heartworm tested and treated (if tested positive) before going to a new home. For more information, visit our website www.canerossorescue.org\nor email us at rescue@canerosso.com.",

She's been great with kids, cats, other dogs, meeting people, car rides, and loved going to Lowes. If you're into active  large breeds this girl is perfect for you?? \n We will require a plan for basic obedience classes and someone committed to helping her reach her full potential.

I have been bouncing around from place to place. I was living with my past owner in his truck for awhile before I came here. It was kind of cramped and I didn't have much room to play. But now I have a whole yard to play in, and I hope you do too! I also went to stay at this other home for a little while... I wasn't getting the exercise I needed and I started herding the small kids there! It's not my fault I promise! I just sometimes get a little rough when I'm playing. I love to run and bounce around. I LOVE to talk and make sure you know I'm around. I love to eat as well! I will eat whenever, wherever and whatever you let me have. I'm super affectionate and I take no time to love up on you if you're sweet. All I really want is a stable home with loving owners... That's the life.

I'm hoping to move up north soon as I think I'm going to love the snow with all my hair! A little about me! I'm a young boy and have a lot of energy! That's the husky in me! I'd love an active family to take me hiking, running and to just play with me! I like other dogs but I love being the lead dog! I'm not mean to other dogs but I'm a take charge kind of guy! With all my energy I might accidentally bowl little children over so maybe some siblings that are a little older. If you don't have any children that's ok too as I'd devote all my love to you! I can't go to a home with kitties because I like to chase them! I'd love to come home with you!!\n\n$600.00 Adoptioni fee. He will be coming from Houston, Texas to Vermont. His adoption fee INCLUDES his neuter, shots, health certificate, Martingale Collar, and transport fee.\n\nPlease fill out this application http://petstablished.com/adoption_form/24721/generic",

He was rescued from a high-intake shelter. Shep is good with other dogs but has not yet been exposed to cats. He has a good understanding of house manners and he is crate trained. Shep walks well on a leash but would really enjoy a more active lifestyle with a family that is experienced and understands working breed dogs. Unfortunately, Shep has tested heartworm positive and will need to undergo treatment. During the next 6 months it is going to be important that Shep follows the protocol provided for his heartworm treatment and that he not be overly active and get his heartrate elevated. Shep would likely be best in a home without young children due to his treatment restrictions. He will not be a good fit for an apartment or mobile home lifestyle. Shep is a sweet boy that will make some lucky family very happy!\n\nShep is seeking a foster-to-adopt home local to the area that he will be receiving his heartwom injections (Lake Orion or Clinton Twp) - only apply if you are in the local area to be able to commit to these vet appointments. Shep will undergo Heartworm treatment and will need to be at her neuter appointments scheduled in March and then April and May for the heartworm injections.

He is good with other dogs and does well with children. He is currently in a high intake shelter and in order for us to save him he will need a foster home! Not much is known about his understanding of house manners or interaction with cats, however all of that will be an integral part of his assessment before being placed in foster home that meets his needs. Shark will need a foster commitment the first week of February when we expect to accept him into the rescue. \n\nSadly, Shark has tested positive for heartworm. He is seeking a foster or foster-to-adopt home local to the area that he will be receiving his heartwom injections (Lake Orion or Clinton Twp) - only apply if you are in the local area to be able to commit to these vet appointments. Shark will undergo Heartworm treatment and will need to be at his neuter appointments scheduled for March and then April and May for the injections. The foster or foster-to-adopt family will need to ensure that the treatment is followed specifically as instructed by the vet, however Furever Tails Animal Rescue is responsible for the cost of the treatment. Please consider fostering to help us rescue Shark!\n\nShark is:\nCurrent on Rabies and Distemper\nDewormed\nHeartworm Tested: Positive and Furever Tails Animal Rescue will be covering the cost of care for heartworm treatment.\nReceiving Heartworm and Flea Prevention\nMicrochipped\nWill be neutered prior to finalizing adoption.\n\nADOPTION FEE: $325\n\nFUREVER TAILS IS A NON-PROFIT, NO-KILL, FOSTER HOME BASED ANIMAL RESCUE BASED OUT OF OAKLAND TOWNSHIP, MI.

We process applications ONLY - there is no guarantee that you will get a response to an inquiry.\n\nMEET FIDEAUX:\n\nFideaux is a 1-2 year old, 65lb Bernese Mountain Dog mix. He is very chill and laid back fella. He is good with other dogs and children, but he has not yet been exposed to cats. He is currently in a high intake shelter and in order for us to save him he will need a foster home! He has a good understanding of house training and is a well mannered boy. Fideaux will need a foster commitment the first week of February when we expect to accept him into the rescue. \n\nFideaux is seeking a foster, or better yet a foster-to-adopt home local to the area that he will be receiving his heartwom injections (Lake Orion or Clinton Twp) - only apply if you are in the local area to be able to commit to these vet appointments. Fideaux will undergo Heartworm treatment and will need to be at her neuter appointments scheduled in March and then April and May for the heartworm injections. The foster or foster-to-adopt family will need to ensure that the treatment is followed specifically as instructed by the vet, however Furever Tails Animal Rescue is responsible for the cost of the treatment. Please consider fostering to help us rescue Fideaux !Please consider fostering to help us rescue Fideaux!\n\nFideaux is:\nCurrent on Rabies and Distemper\nDewormed\nHeartworm Tested: Positive and Furever Tails Animal Rescue will be covering the cost of care for heartworm treatment.\nReceiving Heartworm and Flea Prevention\nMicrochipped\nWill be neutered prior to adoption.\n\nADOPTION FEE: $300\n\nFUREVER TAILS IS A NON-PROFIT, NO-KILL, FOSTER HOME BASED ANIMAL RESCUE BASED OUT OF OAKLAND TOWNSHIP, MI.

Sandi Paws rescued me with a fractured fibula and tibia in the rear left leg. I also had a tibia tarsal luxation, and had an extreme fixator in my left leg. I also had a wire and screws in my right leg. I had to go to the vet because I had a reaction to the hardware that was in my right leg and I had to have it removed. I am being fostered with six kids of all different ages. I get along with cats and dogs of all different ages and sizes. I am potty trained, crate trained, and leash trained as well. If interested please go to SandiPawsRescue.org for more information you can also find volunteering information as well.\nThank you for your interest in a Sandi Paws Rescue, Inc.

Since he is older he did not want to deal with a litter of pups. These babies have had limited socialization with others. There are a couple that are very shy, but otherwise loving and playful. These babies are furry for a Texas heeler so we think dad was a poodle or collie mix. \n\n \n\nWe are a foster based rescue based out of Muskegon, MI. We have an application process for adopting our pets. We have an application on our website www.caninesrescue.com. PLEASE DO NOT EMAIL US WITH YOUR APPLICATION INFORMATION. WE REQUIRE YOU FILL OUT THE FORM. We check vet references, backgrounds for abuse or neglect and home ownership or speak to the landlord to verify you are allowed to have a pet. Once the application is received and approved then we will set up a time for you to come and meet our pups that are available. All our dogs are up to date on shots, microchipped, been dewormed at least once, and sterilized. All meet and greets are APPOINTMENT ONLY.

Their adoption fee is $450 and includes spay/neuter, age appropriate vaccinations, a nose to tail vet check, microchip and transport costs. Second Chances lists dogs as being available in White River Junction, VT because we transport our dogs to the area every 3rd week after they have been adopted.

It is claimed that this one groundhog has lived to make weather prognostications since 1886, sustained by drinks of \"\"groundhog punch\"\" or \"\"elixir of life\"\" administered at the annual Groundhog Picnic in the fall\n\nADOPTION FEE: $250.00\n\nAll our adoptable dogs are spayed or neutered, micro-chipped, dewormed, UTD on age appropriate DA2PP & Bordetella Vaccines as well as on Heartworm & Flea Preventatives.\n\n*READ ALL - COVID 19*\n\nWE ARE OPEN BY APPOINTMENT ONLY & MASKS ARE REQUIRED. \n\nOur facility is currently CLOSED TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. \n\nYOU MUST APPLY AND BE APPROVED TO ADOPT TO GET AN APPOINTMENT\n\nAPPLY TO MEET HERE: https://form.jotform.com/202887123155152\n\nApplying does not commit you but rather gives you permission to meet & adopt if you choose to.\n\nONCE APPROVED WE WILL CALL & EMAIL YOU - APPROVALS CAN TAKE A FEW DAYS\n\n** WEEKEND APPLICANTS **\nWE ARE CLOSED SUNDAY & MONDAY THUS YOU WILL NOT HEAR BEFORE TUESDAY\n\nWe realize that you are excited & anxious to know but calling us daily to check keeps us from working on the applications & delays the process. \n\nONLY ONE APPLICATION NEEDED \nIf interested in more than one pup just put all the names on one application. If you already have an approved application then just email us at lchsmanager@gmail.com to tell us you which animals you want your approved application applied to.\n\nOnly approved applicants wearing a MASK will be allowed to enter our facility and meet our pets. \n\nPlease do not request an appointment if you or anyone in your household have had symptoms of COVID 19 or been around anyone that you know has been positive or experienced symptoms within past 14 days. It is of the utmost importance that our staff stays healthy so our pets can be taken care of. After someone leaves our facility everything is cleaned with bleach water for the safety of all!\n\nAll our pets are posted online and we continue to take applications until they are actually adopted. Many times things change and an approved adopter does not adopt the animal so we do maintain a wait list when necessary. \n\nThank you for reading this and following the directions. It is a part of our approval process!\n\nAPPLY HERE: https://form.jotform.com/202887123155152\n\nADOPTION FEE: $250.00",

            "description": "Meet sweet Hank. Hank is a 10 month old American Staffordshire Terrier/mixed breed. He'd a medium sized dog, about 45-ish pounds. He is a social guy with people and other dogs. He came to us from Apache Junction where he was an owner turn in. He is a loving guy and puts himself to bed every night at 8 pm! This handsome guy is residing at our adoption center and can't wait to find a forever family to love.\n\nWe currently do not require appointments but this is subject to change due to the current COVID situation (masks are required). We will be monitoring the number of people in our building when we are open, so please be patient if you are asked to wait outside until we help families that arrived before you. If we feel our dogs would not do well with other dogs or with young children, we will state it in their bio - if it doesn't mention it, then we will do introductions with your dog(s). If you're interested in this dog, please go to our website at www.azfriends.org and fill out a consultation form, then just come and see us!All animals are altered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, licensed (dogs). Cats tested for FELV/FIV. Dogs tested for Heartworm. All animals are available to the first family that is a good match, and if we have more than one animal who is a good match, there will be a lottery for all matches. Note that families must have come in to our adoption center and spoken with an adoption counselor prior to any lottery (when we have lotteries, they usually occur on Saturday mornings).",

I even restricted the type of dogs I would foster because of that fear. When I heard he was a lab/pit mix almost cancelled. \nBut now I am so glad i opened my heart and my home to this guy! He is so sweet! He Loves cuddles ! He is so well behaved! Today I forgot to lock the crate when I went out. He was loose in my house for four hours ...no accidents, nothing destroyed, just an excited boy greeting me at the door when I got home!!! He will be a wonderful companion for one lucky family\nAvailable on Adoptions Uncrated, Wednesday February 3rd at 7pm https://www.followyourheartanimalrescue.org/shop",

            "description": "Amora is a two year old Kelpie mix (according to county but she looks more shepherd mix to me ) weighing in at 35 lbs. She's the momma to the Love Pups and has spent the last 8 weeks in her momma role but the time has come for Amora to find an amazing forever home of her own \n\nAmora came to us very under socialized and has warmed up in our home very well. She is such a lover and enjoys being with us whether that means laying at my feet while I work or snoozing with us while we watch TV. Her forever family should be prepared to continue to work on her socialization and should understand that there will be a warm up period for her in her new home. Meeting new people can sometimes be a little overwhelming for Amora so introductions with no pressure allowing her to make friends at her own pace work well. \n\nAmora does well on car rides, sleeps well in her crate and walks ok on her leash (this is an area that could benefit from some more work). She tends to get startled when cars drive by but we feel that this is something that would go away with more exposure and practice. She is also potty trained and uses the dog door. \n\nAmora would be great as an only dog or a companion to a dog of her size or larger who is on the mellower side and not necessarily looking for a play/wrestle buddy. Amora has done ok co-existing with our dogs but has not really saught out play with them. She has however recently learned that toys are fun to play with on occasion and enjoys tennis balls and carrying stuffed toys around in her mouth. \n\nOne thing we have noticed about Amora is that her prey drive instinct is present. For this reason it is important that Amora's forever home not have any cats or other small animals (chickens, birds, bunnies, etc).\n\nAmora is a special girl and has won our hearts. She has her quirks (like chasing the wind and biting at rain drops ) but she's hard not to fall for. We know that the perfect family to help Amora continue to blossom into the great dog we know she can be is out there and we're beyond excited for her and what her future life holds.\n\nAmora will be available for adoption on our website on Wednesday 2/3 at 7pm.",

            "description": "Little Wesley is about as sweet as they come, and he is crossing his paws that hell soon find a home to call his own! Wesley is one of mama Arias boys (along with Fenrir, Tom, & Wheeler). Aria is an itty-bitty pittie mix (around 40lbs), but we arent sure who Wesleys daddy is...so we cant guarantee what his size/weight will end up being. Wesley is currently 5 months old and weighs about 25lbs. He is a smart little boy, and has been picking up quickly on his potty-training routine. He alerts his foster family that he needs to go out by ringing the bell on their door. He can be a little bit nervous with new human friends, but hes still young and impressionable and tends to warm up pretty quickly! Wesley loves other dogs and would definitely benefit from having another confident dog in the home, but this isnt necessarily a requirement. It is currently unknown how he would do with cats, but since he is still pretty young we think he would adapt and be ok. In general, Wesley is a quiet boy who loves to hang out for naps in his kennel. He has been sleeping through the night, and he is a good little eater. He also does well with the [older] kids in his foster home. If there are kids in Wesleys forever home, we would recommend they be ages 8+, as currently Wesleys least favorite thing is when his foster humans pick him up. Therefore, any kids in his home should be old enough to understand how to positively work with him on this and/or to not pick him up. He is such an adorably sweet boy, and we cant wait to see him settle into his perfect forever! \n\nIf you are interested in adoption Wesley, please submit a general adoption application at https://newleashdogrescue.com (or private message us if youre already preapproved!). \n\n**Wesleys $250 adoption fee includes his neuter, vaccines to date, and microchip.",

            "description": "Meet Rosey! Rosey is a 2 year old female with similarities to a Chiweenie. Her foster mom says, \"The man who surrendered her said that she was 2 and was trying to give her away in free sites saying he didn't have time for her. She lived in the trailer park with the man and his wife and their pitbull. Said she loves children and is good with dogs and cats. He said she was given to him and he never wanted her in the first place. She is initially timid (typical of her chi breed) but quickly trusts you. Is not reactive at all. Seems to feel most comfortable with females but tolerates males. She loves to play but also loves to chill. She is fine on a leash but has a hard time going to the bathroom on one, would prefer someone with a fenced area. She doesn't seem to be a flight risk as she is Velcro to her person. She loves to be wherever they are. She doesn't like to be left alone. Rosey is heartworm positive and needs to be spayed which the rescue will take care of. She is up to date on vaccines.

            "description": "This blue-eyed, handsome hunk recently found himself euth listed in an overcrowded Texas shelter. With the help of a partnering organization, Muddy Paws was able to bring Oso and 12 other young dogs 900 miles to rescue. Oso is now safe, warm, and adjusting to his new beginning. He's still acclimating to his new environment (and climate!) but his foster says that Oso is a big, gentle, sweetheart who likes to lounge on the couch or relax in a comfy bed with his favorite people. Oso is definitely one of our new fosters who is diggin' winter weather; he is loving being outside right now and, as a big boy, he'll need a large, fenced yard to explore and play. He gets along with other dogs and has his leash manners down pat! We'll continue to post updates about Oso's personality and furever \"wish list\" as we learn more. Welcome to rescue, Oso!\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Oso is $400 We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes. \n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver. \n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months. \n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

            "description": "This stunning, year-old Doberman Pinscher recently found herself euth listed in an overcrowded shelter in Texas. With the help of a partnering organization, Muddy Paws was able to bring Zuri and 12 other young dogs 900 miles to rescue. Tonight Zuri is safe, warm, and adjusting to her new beginning. She'll be spending the next few days acclimating to her new environment (and climate!) and we'll be posting more information about her personality and furever \"wish list\" in the coming days! Welcome to rescue, Zuri!\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Zuri is $400 We are a 501c3 organization which means that your donation may be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Your donation goes toward the high cost of veterinary care for our animals in rescue, as well as providing supportive services to animals in homes. \n\nInformation about the adoption process: All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. The adoptions for all of our animals will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver. \n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months. \n\nTo learn about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue or donate to our animals, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com or our Facebook Page.",

He loves playing with toys, especially tennis balls, long walks, car rides and snuggles with his humans.\n\nDuke gets along well with other dogs and enjoys playing. He would chase cats given the chance, but takes correction from them. He never meets a stranger and loves all kids, little and big. He is not a fan of the crate, but he is quiet inside it, although does his best to work his way out of it. He is house trained with a doggy door, but he may need to adjust to a home without one. He loves a leash because it means he is going for a walk!\n\nPlease Note: All dogs currently available for adoption are posted on our website. If you cannot find a particular dog on our website, he/she may be on a temporary foster hold. All dogs are otherwise posted until they are officially adopted.

Has a lot\nof energy and loves going for walks! - - He can get easily excited when he sees small animals\nlike cats or squirrels and sometimes will try to jump up on or grumble to the adults to get\nthem to take him for walks but we've been working with him on his behavior and so far he's been quick to learn to be more settled.\n- He's a very good listener! He would probably\ndo well in a house with other dogs or active\nhumans.\n- He's house trained.\nHomer is staying with us while he waits\nto find his forever family!

Considering his age, Clarence still has plenty of pep, zip and skip in his step. He is playful, strong and can be boisterous, yet he's a gentleman. Clarence walks great, knows sit, stay and come. He loves and will sit for treats and, most of the time, takes them gently, Clarence is a real sweetheart who's calm, affectionate and friendly. His adoption fee is $75. Clarence is neutered, current on shots, wormed, microchipped and treated with monthly heart worm, flea and tick preventive.",

She is needing a comfortable foster home where she can rest up and get lots of love. She is it a lot of pain but is a sweet natured girl. She won't be hard to care for and will just need her foster to clean her wounds and give her easy oral medication. On top of that, this girl is pregnant! Luckily, the babies seem to be okay but she does need to go somewhere soon as she is about half way into her pregnancy. We will need someone who can care for her and her pups until they are weaned and able to move to another foster home, unless you want to keep the pups until they can be adopted! Let us know if you can help with angel!",

            "description": "Cookie, cookie cookie - do you love cookies? Then come meet Cookie Monster! This active, mischievous, playful, smart, loving, and goofy boy loves affection, cuddles, and other canine playmates. It's hard to resist his hyena face and adorable white paw. He is also a super cuddler, and loves to be near his humans when they are chilling out. He will lay his head right in your lap and gaze soulfully into your eyes. He also loves to be in the middle of his humans on the couch. Cookie takes a bit to warm up to new humans and men are especially scary to him, so patience and time is something that he will need. Cookie could potentially be an excellent exercise dog, and he would love a home where he can be active and get some nice long walks during the day. He is a smart pup who can sometimes be a bit stubborn, and he needs continued training on manners - he can pay and nip at his humans when he wants attention. He also has an adorable quirk where he steals socks - forget losing your socks in the dryer, Cookie will take them all! He has another adorable habit of making lots of little grunting and barking noises when he zooms! Cookie needs to be in a crate when his humans are away on their pesky errands. He will typically whine while his humans are away. His foster family has been crate-training him, and he's doing better. He enjoys eating treats and sleeping in his crate, but prefers not to be left alone in his crate. He has also made huge strides in his potty training, and has been going to the door when it's that time of day. Cookie has been learning his leash training and would love a family to continue with his leash manners because he can be reactive to other dogs and other people on the leash. He is generally very well behaved, but needs some additional training when it comes to human food. He has been working really hard, and is doing much better. An ideal home for Cookie would be one that is adults only, with parents that are around a lot and who have training experience. He would do best in a low traffic home with a yard, and lots of activity and structure. If you are looking for that adorable Cookie Monster to cuddle with, then come meet this sweet boy and let him steal your cookies!",

PJ is a loving, playful young pup who likes to play fetch on his own by throwing his toys in the air and running after them. Of course, he proudly shows you his toy after he's gone and fetched it. He loves to cuddle, and hopes you won't mind his snoring when he inevitably falls asleep next to you. PJ was found with a plastic Halloween pumpkin stuck on his head, and was understandably really confused and scared after it came off his big, adorable head. Since then, though, he's really come out of his shell! It seems like PJ is experiencing everything for the first time. Something as mundane as the dishwasher turning on to as exciting as meeting a new dog friend. PJ welcomes it all with wonder and curiosity. PJ is house-trained and crate-trained. He currently lives with another dog, and would love to have more dog friends to help teach him how to continue learning his doggie skills. Are you ready for your new best friend? PJ certainly is. Come meet this sweet boy!",

            "description": "If you want to become Barney's friend, then come visit him, you'll find this big puppy wiggling in your lap - and giving you sweet sloppy kisses. He'll be so happy to be your new best friend, snuggling, and asking for cuddles. He will want to play fetch and tug-o-war with you. This loving, affectionate boy needs a slow introduction to new humans, and once he's learned to trust them, he becomes their most loyal, loving buddy, hoping for walks and runs. He's a goofy, long-legged boy who loves to zoom around, and initiate playtime in the play yard with his doggie friends. As a super smart pup, Barney loves learning new skills. He already understands 'sit,' 'shake' and 'leave it.' He's also already house-trained. Barney would prefer a home with active adults who will take him on runs, play some tug of war, and cuddle on the couch. He likes to meet new friends slowly, so a low-traffic home would be ideal. He is loyal to his humans, and can be protective of them outside, so he would love a home where he can easily navigate the neighborhood. A low-key apartment with a straight shot outside could also be ideal. He will be happy to be in a home as the only pup, or he could hang with a well-matched dog. Come meet this adorable boy!",

He's eager to play fetch with people at the park. Then at his new foster home, this playful, energetic boy is excited to play fetch with balls and sticks of every size and play tug-o-war with his rope toys. And if his humans will pet and brush him, he's even happier. This very loyal, friendly youngster (also known as Cooper) is also a very kind boy. His foster is disabled and mostly in a wheelchair, so Yam is very gentle and obedient with him, fetching balls and leaving them on his lap. And he goes on slow walks with him. He's also protective of his doggie housemate, playing and then napping together. And he's getting along well with a visiting retriever and kids, wanting to play with them, too. Yam is a smart, quick learner who knows 'come,' 'stop,' 'sit,' 'lay,' 'wait,' 'no bark,' and 'come get a treat.' He's made good progress on his leash-walking skills. And he's a house-trained boy who sleeps well in his crate. Unleashed, he'll go to the yard to potty, run up and down and explore some curiosities, then return within minutes. He's a very lovable boy who will be a best friend his family can count on for love and loyalty. Come meet him, he'll be so happy to be your caretaker!",

Once he warms up to you, this sweet and quirky boy can't get enough pets from his family! He will never leave your side, and will show you constant love and affection, and give you so many kisses and cuddles. This little athlete loves to be outside for brisk walks or runs, sniffing and exploring. And he loves playing tug of war and fetch. This boy is also super silly! In his free time, he loves to jump up and dance with tail-wags, run around with his dog-tag in his mouth, and play tag! He is also very well-behaved with other dogs. In the past, he was a stray, so he can be shy with new people. Now that he's with people he loves, he can have some anxiety being separated from them. He is becoming more confident, always showing his love for them. He is a smart boy who understands basic commands such as 'sit,' 'lay down' and 'go night-night.' And he is a house-trained boy who is making progress on crate-training, going in on command and for treats. Runescape would love a low traffic home with plenty of room to run and play in a backyard. He doesn't love being left alone for long, so he hopes for a home with people who are there most of the time, maybe with some kiddos. If you're looking for a new member of the family, he will bring a smile to your face and warm your heart daily. Come meet this silly, handsome boy!",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Zeke and I am a very sweet boy! I like to spend my days cuddled nearby my foster parents or in my cozy bed. I like to play fetch, especially with toys that squeak! \n\nI know a lot of words and commands and love to show off my skills for treats.  I love my humans but I am not the biggest fan of other dogs, especially when I am on my leash on a walk. My foster parents have been working with me to ignore other dogs and I am doing really well! My foster home said I definitely need a fenced in yard. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please fill out our application here: http://www.rchsks.org/our-animals/adopt-a-pet/adopting-a-dog.  By filling out the application you are not committing yourself to adopting; it's a screening process that must be completed before you meet the dog. Please do this BEFORE calling. Our voicemail is only checked periodically and you can reach us much faster via dog-coordinators@rchsks.org.  Thank you!",

He is approximately 10 years old. He is Chocolate and white with a short coat and weighs 56.5 lbs\n\nJohnny is very friendly with everyone he meets. He has been exposed to children and does well. \nHe is a mellow guy who enjoys sun bathing, lounging and going for walks.\nJohnny does well with other dogs of all sizes. He interacts and plays with other dogs at the dog park. \nHe does well with cats too.\nJohnny is house trained and does well on a leash.\nJohnny knows several commands including SIT, WAIT, SHAKE and DOWN. \nIf you would like to meet this sweet and friendly senior, please apply at yvpr.org/adoptions \n\nAn application must be filled out and accepted before a meet can be set up. If accepted, you will hear from us within 72 hours. You will have the opportunity to ask questions before you meet the pet; an adoption may or may not happen at that time. We do adopt outside the Yakima area IF you are able to come to Yakima to pick up your adopted pet.  We do not have a kennel facility; all of our pets are in foster homes. Therefore, meets and adoptions take place at either our office or at a place chosen by the foster.   If a pet has 'pending' beside its name, an adoption is imminent. Please fill out an application anyway because adoptions don't always go through. Your application will be kept on file for 30 days in case you find another pet you'd like to apply for.  Thanks for thinking adoption and Good Luck!",

She is very smart & eager to please. \n \n\n\nAn application must be filled out and accepted before a meet can be set up. If accepted, you will hear from us within 72 hours. You will have the opportunity to ask questions before you meet the pet; an adoption may or may not happen at that time. We do adopt outside the Yakima area IF you are able to come to Yakima to pick up your adopted pet.  We do not have a kennel facility; all of our pets are in foster homes. Therefore, meets and adoptions take place at either our office or at a place chosen by the foster.   If a pet has 'pending' beside its name, an adoption is imminent. Please fill out an application anyway because adoptions don't always go through. Your application will be kept on file for 30 days in case you find another pet you'd like to apply for.  Thanks for thinking adoption and Good Luck!",

She loves to cuddle up under your blankets in bed & enjoys gentle pats on her side.\nShe becomes alarmed if you touch her face or neckwe suspect she may have been tethered, given a collar that was too small, or in some way mishandled by her previous owner.\nShe has shown no signs of aggression, even when scared. She is currently using puppy pads and will need someone who can work with her house training and learning to walk on a leash. She has not had any accidents off the puppy pads.\nShe is currently in heat & we are working to schedule her spay & update her vaccinations.\nPeaches is available to a foster-to-adopt household while we get her vetted.",

            "description": "URGENT!!! URGENT!!! URGENT!!! URGENT!!!\nTHIS POOR OLD GUY NEEDS A SOFT PLACE TO LAND! WILL YOU BE HIS HERO???\nBernard or Bernie as we call him is looking for either a new foster or furever home! He is a approximately 8 years old, mixed breed, approximately 60lbs, neutered, microchipped,  and up to date on vaccines. He is a sweet boy who only wants to spend time with his people.  Would do best as an only dog. Bernie was pulled back in July from the local shelter and has been in a foster home this whole time but the resident dogs have decided that they don't like Bernie very much anymore so we need to move him asap. \n\nIf you are interested in fostering or adopting Bernie please copy and paste the link below to your browser and complete our application at https://daniellethedogrescuer.wufoo.com/forms/zq5l29b022pyq0/\n\nFROM HIS PREVIOUS FOSTER MOM:\n                                                                      \nBernie has been my foster since about July 2020. He was introduced to my 3 dogs and did great. I had a 5' field fence surrounding almost a 1/2 acre where he loved to run, explore and play.  He was great until I moved in November. Around October my alpha dog Duncan passed away then in November I moved to a new location. Unfortunately The new place did not have a secure fence for a couple of months and Bernie had to be let out on a runner. He was not happy as he loves to explore. By the time I got the fence up and let him loose with my other 2 dogs there was conflict and animosity between them. Hindsight now suggests that it was probably a combination of them jockeying for the newly open alpha position, the move, and the stimulation of the new neighbor dogs running the fence line. . Before this they were all fine together.    Bernie has never shown any aggression towards people. I can take away food, bones, toys, whatever and he's fine. He does have a prey drive for small animals like bunnies, birds and squirrels. Not sure about cats but wouldn't chance it. He is an absolutely sweet boy and loves people and spending time with them. If walked on a leash he is best suited to a no-pull harness but then again I never really had time to work with him since he had major surgery on his ACL a month after coming to me and took 3 months to heal. Currently, he was injured in an altercation by my other dog and will need some time to decompress and settle into a new home without any additional dogs bothering him until he fully heals. I was told that he was 8years old but it was probably due to his deteriorated condition. Based on his energy level I seriously doubt he's older that 5 years old.  Bernie can be an opportunistic runner. We were teaching him the \"back\" command when opening the front door and he was doing much better. One time after he ran the neighborhood exploring he ended up at a neighbors back yard and when I got there he  was interacting with their little child of about 5 years old.  Bernie was good with him and the child was hugging him around the neck. Bernie was very accepting of the interaction. He has never dug to get out of the yard. He just looks for opportunities like a broken/low part of the fence or a place where he can squeeze under if the fence is loose.   I did find that Bernie doesn't like to be crated.  He generally barks and gets very upset but does calm down after a while but sometimes the stress upsets his stomach. The only time I ever had to crate him is when I went out of town and had a professional sitter watch him. Although resistant he was able to be coaxed to go in the crate. He wasn't a fan but was able to be lead into it fine. Usually I never had to contain him since he was always a great boy in the house.  While he LOVES to chew his toys he never chewed or destroyed anything in the house. Bernie is very smart and trainable. When he first came he wasn't house broken but learned to potty outside within a week and never had an accident after.",

If you're interested in meeting/adopting me, please visit www.rescueonespringfield.com/our-adoption-process/adoption-application/ and fill out the form! We do adopt out of state with vet references and video home check. *Adopter is responsible for coming to get the dog and returning the dog if the adoption does not work out* \n\nDon't forget to LIKE us on Facebook!-www.facebook.com/rescueonespringfield\n\n*Remember, dogs are pack animals. Because of this, Rescue One does not adopt to outdoor-only homes. Pets are family and are not disposable.  Please make sure that you are 100% committed to a pet before considering adding one to your home.",

Hollar gets along very well with other dogs, kids and his foster's cats, too! With that temperament and those good looks, he'd be a great family dog. (posted 1/30/21, TN)\n**It is rare that we know with certainty the ages or mixes that make up our dogs, but we do our best to be as accurate as possible based upon our experience. **\nAdoption: $350 which covers quarantine, shots, worming, food, medical records, spaying/neutering,microchip and an Alabama State Health Certificate.\nTransport, if needed : $140.00 We consider the transport to be of great importance and, as such, take particular care of the dogs during the trip from Alabama.

We have partners we work with there that pull these dogs from the worst horrors imaginable before they are set to be on someone's dinner plate.\nMany of these dogs start off in horrific puppy mill type facilities on tiny rabbit cage size wire crates in complete filth. If they are not sold at 6 or 8 weeks then they either stay for a couple years to be used to breed more and then are sold off to the meat trade, or they are sold off right away. South Korea is one of the only countries that actually farms dogs for their meat. Little dogs are used for elixirs and potions.\nGentle is very sweet! Gentle and several of his friends have been flown here for a chance at a future and a real life. Our adoption fee is $600 which helps offset some of the flight costs.

THE PUPPIES WILL NOT BE AT THE ADOPTION CENTER ON THE WEEKEND. IN ORDER TO OBTAIN AN APPOINTMENT YOU MUST FILL OUT AN ADOPTION APPLICATION INTEREST.\n\nAsgard is about  4 months old and currently weighing about 20  lbs. The pups were found in the middle of the desert with no housing around the area.   They were brought in as strays and no owner came forward.  It was suspect that they were driven out there and dumped.   More will be known about me soon.  \n\nThis breed is very loyal to their family and does not generally allow rehoming into another family if their first family does not/can not keep them for life.   PLEASE consider, this is a LIFETIME commitment for this breed.  Originally bred to guard livestock, shar-peis are alert, intelligent and protective dogs who make excellent guardians. They possess a calm and devoted nature that makes them loving companions. They tend to be aloof with strangers, but are fiercely loyal and affectionate with their own people and love to spend time in the company of their families. \n\nBy providing them with socialization and obedience training as puppies can also make them easier to handle as adults, as shar-peis are strong-willed dogs whose personalities may overwhelm an unprepared pet parent. These dogs do best with confident, assertive leadership to help them know how to properly behave.\n\nPuppy adoption fees are $450, which includes the following: ($354 at the time of adoption)\nSpay/Neuter\nRabies\n1st Set of puppy shots\n2nd set of puppy shots\n3rd set of puppy shots\nmicrochip\ndeworm\n2 free vet visits\n\nFor adult dogs, WE WILL BE HOLDING ADOPTIONS ON SATURDAYS & SUNDAYS FROM 10-4 PM at our Adoption Center. No appointments necessary.  \n\nA Path 4 Paws holds adoption events at our Adoptions Store,  located at 232 N. Jones Blvd, Suite 170  right next to CAL Ranch (North Jones/ I-95).   Please bring your dog(s) for a meet and greet (if applicable)  Please bring your entire family so everyone can meet. \n\nIf you are interested in Asgard, please contact dogrescuelv@hotmail.com to confirm the dog you are interested in,  will be attending that particular event.  We have limited space at the store, therefore we can not take every dog out to the event.\n\nAsgard is spayed/neutered, has current vaccinations and includes a microchip, deworming and 2 free vet visits.  Adoption fee applies.  Please make sure you have read the information listed on the homepage for requirements and restrictions. \n\nFoster homes & volunteers are always needed.  Please contact us regarding how you can help by fostering or volunteering for our organization.",

My name is Boomerang, and I am the happiest boy in the whole, wide world. Just hearing someone's voice sets off my wiggly dance. My ideal forever home is a home filled with snuggles, scratchies, and lots of couch time. Couch time is my favorite, especially when you let me snuggle up as close as I possibly can. Ya see- I haven't always had the best of luck in my past and the result is my back leg is a littlewonky. I can still get around well- even run- but my gait is just a little different. My foster family says it just adds to my character and uniqueness. My boots also make me unique. Sometimes I wear magical booties on my back feeties so I don't slip on hardwood floors. They make me more confident and help me on stairs, too. My foster family has had dozens of foster dogs and they've never quite had a foster as \"sweet and wonderful\" as I am. That makes me proud! I don't know many fancy tricks, but I am very well mannered. I would love to be a part of a family with kids or other dogs. Other dogs help me feel comfortable and are good snuggle stand ins until I can plop down with my beloved humans. If you are looking for a low key, extremely loveable new member of your family- I am your boy! Let's be best friends forever!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Boomerang, please fill out an adoption application on our website at www.underhoundrailroad.org. Boomerang is currently being fostered in North Carolina is by transport North to his furever home beginning in late February.",

If you have been looking for a dog that is mature, but fun loving and full of great energy, Annika is the girl for you. Very affectionate too.\n\nAnnika was raised from a tiny pup by a single man. She was with him 24/7, until he passed away Halloween 2020. Annika fell into deep depression and quit eating, she missed him so much. She was his car buddy, hardware store, auto store buddy. He built her a special seat in his van so she could watch the world go by on their many days out looking for car parts. She laid at his feet when he wrenched on his cars. Nothing was too good for his special girl! Annika thrives on love and attention.\n\nAnnika has recovered from her sadness, and is ready to live and love again! She has many family visitors, but none can add her to their homes. Soon her house will be sold, so it is time! Annika is an indoor girl. Does not like being out in the cold.\n\nAnnika would do great with a couple. Older kids and visitors are fine with this friendly girl. She does take her job as head squirrel chaser serious, so maybe no scaredy-cat. A cat that won\u2019t run is probably ok. A 4\u2019 fence keeps her safely in yard. She will not run away. She adores family and will stay close even off leash. Dad taught her many good manners.\n\nIf you feel you can give Annika the perfect forever home, please contact us. Home check and modest Sr adoption fee.\n\nCaindenises@gmail.com\nGrass Valley, Ca",

            "description": "Meet Sirine! She is an adorable loving 5 year old that was rescued off the streets of Thailand after being dumped. Many expats (non Thai residents), spend half the year in Thailand and wind up adopting dogs while they are there. When it's time to go back to their own country, they leave the dogs on the road. Only a handful will ever survive this life. Sirine is one of the very lucky ones. She was found and taken to a vet clinic, where sadly she then lived in a cage for a year. One of the rescuers we work with was finally able to get her from this clinic and take her to her home before she could be ready to fly. On January 29th, she made her freedom flight to Los Angeles to search for a new future and a life she once only dreamed possible. She is a gentle sweet soul that would prefer to be in your arms and on your lap as much as possible. She is a sweet adorable girl who is ready for her new chance and to only be spoiled and pampered for the rest of her life. Our adoption fee is $600 which helps offset some of the flight costs. If you are interested in adopting, please go to our website and fill out an online application form. https://form.jotform.com/oscarlucy/dog-adoption-app",

She is approximately 14lbs of pure love and cuddles! She has had her first set of puppy vaccines and is microchipped. Her second set of puppy vaccines and her spay at 16 weeks old are also included with her adoption. We do believe she is a Rottweiler mix so she will be a large sized girl approximately 60 to 70lbs when full grown. She is a well behaved puppy and is already getting the hang of potty training!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Faith please copy and paste our application link into your browser and complete at:\n\nhttps://daniellethedogrescuer.wufoo.com/forms/zq5l29b022pyq0/\n\nPlease no calls or texts. We will process your application and get back to you.\n\nAdopter must be located within a 30 mile radius of Trinity, Florida 34655",

We are open intake, meaning we can not turn away animals from either county we serve. Our shelter intakes double or triple it's capacity every month so it is essential we place animals quickly into adoptive homes. Since so many animals enter the shelter we often don't have enough volunteers to write an individual bio for each. Please feel free to call the shelter Wednesday-Sunday to inquire about the animal you are interested in. 706-795-2868.\n\nViewing and adoption hours at our shelter are Wednesday through Sunday from 12 PM to 5 PM. \nAll adoption fees include age-appropriate vaccinations, flea treatment, deworming, and spay or neuter, microchip, and adoption packet. \nFees:\nDogs over 4 months old: $100\nPuppies under 4 months: $125. \nCats and Kittens are $75 ($65 without microchip). \n\nFor your convenience you can fill out an adoption application for any of our current residents at www.moaspets.com. Join us on Facebook at\nhttps://www.facebook.com/moaspets. It's a great way to stay up to the minute on the furry 4 legged friends we have looking for a loving forever home. \nWe are located at:\n1888 Colbert Danielsville Rd \nDanielsville, GA 30633 \n706-795-2868\n\nNOTE: Our adoptions are first come first served, simply filling out an application does not mean the animal will be held for you, you must come meet the animal in person in order to be considered for adoption.\nIf you rent you must bring your lease or a letter from your landlord stating you may adopt.",

Her owners are moving and have too many dogs and she and another male \"Mickey\" will be left behind.\n\n\"Blue\" is nicely house trained and crate trained, is a playful puppy who chews anything and everything and runs like the wind.  She will need further training and is at the perfect age to work with.  She will perhaps need a home with another older dog to guide her.  She will have to be spayed, microchipped and brought current on vaccinations before going to her new home.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting \"Blue\" please email kathy@3dogrescue.com for an application to adopt.  We do not adopt to families with children under the age of 5 and prefer families within a 200 mile radius of Powell/Cody for followup vetting or boosters.  Her adoption fee is $200 and she will come with complete vet records, microchip registration, and a crate if you so desire.\n\n",

I enjoy walking and can even be a great running partner. I get along well with my foster brother so a house with or without pets would be fine with me.

In turn Little Debbie immediately wins the heart of her new human friends. She has been non-reactive to dogs and cats but would require a proper introduction and/or cat test to know if she could live with them. Little Debbie could be the only dog in the household, with or without older children and would be equally at home in a house or apartment/condo with consistent daily activity and outings.",

He has been health checked, first vaccination and de-wormed.  \nWe are unsure of his mix -- but he looks like he could be a Lab mix.  He has a beautiful reddish-brown coat with brown eyes.     He is a little shy initially, but playful and loves to wrestle with his siblings.   He will need housetraining and someone around much of the day for his socialization, training and development.   A fenced yard is required.  No apartments.   No children under the age of 7 years old due to sharp puppy teeth.   Austin area adoptions only. \n\nHe will be neutered & microchipped when he is older (included in his adoption). \n\nIf interested, please complete an on-line application at:\nwww.forgottenfriendstx.org",

If you want to alter (spay or neuter) your puppy at your vet, the adoption fee is $450.00, and we ask you to sign a spay/neuter contract and will need to show proof of S/N at later date.\n\nredemptionroad.mn@gmail.com\n\nhttp://redemptionroadrescue.rescuegroups.org\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/RedemptionRoadRescue (Message us!)\n\nAll animals fully vetted appropriate for age:\nSpayed or Neutered\nRabies vaccine\nDHPP vaccine\n4DX test (@12 months or older)\nMicrochipped\nDewormed\nFlea/tick prevention",

They all fought hard but sadly 1 of the puppies did not survive. Blanca and her brother Mando love to play together but are not bonded and can be adopted separately. They just received their 3rd set of puppy shots and will need to be spayed/neutered/microchipped and get the 4th round of puppy shots in 3-4 weeks.

            "description": "Sweet Lily lost her family when her dad had to go into assisted living and wasn't able to take her. She was in boarding with our boarding partner for a couple months while he was in and out of the hospital. Once he realized he wasn't going to be able to continue to care for her, he surrendered her in hopes of Lily finding a wonderful and loving home for her golden years. Lily is an easygoing girl who would love a big, soft bed and a few treats now and then. She doesn't ask for much and promises to be a very good girl.\nWe are looking for a foster or forever home for Lily.\n\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION: www.tinyurl.com/IADRAdoptionApp\n\nIf you'd like to help Lily while she searches for her very own family, you can sponsor her for only $19/month here: https://petbucks.org/pet/6222/sponsor/create\n\n\n***IMPORTANT- PLEASE READ***\nThe State of Texas requires rescues to collect sales tax on any adoption fees. Our adoption fee is $175. Texas State Sales Tax will be added to that amount.\n\nDue to the nature of our adoption process, our fosters are usually only able to consider potential adopters within the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. A vet reference is required, and a trial period will be completed before finalizing the adoption. Thank you for your understanding.",

This sweet girl was discarded by her family in Turkey when one of the family members became allergic to dogs. Lucky for Lala she was taken care of by our rescuer until she was able to fly to the US in mid January. After arriving, Lala adjusted immediately to the good life with her foster family and doggie foster sister.\n\nShe has LOTS of energy and wants to be anywhere her humans are. She is definitely the epitome of a velcro doggie. The only time she isn\u2019t sitting at your side is when she is playing with a toy or ball. Lala is very smart and is doing great with her basic commands.  She sits when told and is learning to come when called. She mastered the doggy door quickly and knows to go to the bathroom outside. As with any rescued dog, Lala will need to be shown the appropriate place to go potty at her forever home and receive praise and treats for going there. \n\nLala is very good on the leash and only pulls when she is excited. She is sweet with other dogs, and is happy to socialize, but she is more interested in attention from humans than from other dogs. She is currently getting 2-3 walks a day, and continuing her daily walking routine will be important to keep her energy in check. Lala would do great in a home with a large yard for her to play fetch in. Lala is quite agile, and if given the opportunity she can jump a 5\u2019+ fence...especially if her people are on the other side. A secure yard with supervised access will be important in her future home. \n\nLaLa loves sleeping on the bed as close to her humans as possible and will cuddle with you all night. She is eager to try to jump up on the couch to join her humans, so a family who is looking for a cuddle buddy would be a good fit for Lala. \n\nLala has a sweet personality and is so lovable. She is great with new people and wants all the scratches and belly rubs she can get. She will do well with a family that can give her love and attention all day and plenty of exercise.\n\nIf Lala sounds like she might be a good fit for your family, please complete an adoption application on our website: www.roversretreat.org\n\nNOTE: due to the high cost of international transportation, Lala\u2019s adoption fee is $1,000",

            "description": "LOOKING FOR A NEW BEST FRIEND?\n\nCheck out Snoozer:\n\nWith his gorgeous, black lined, super expressive bedroom eyes, his awesome friendly personality and his easy to get along with nature, Snoozer is a rare gem, when it comes to rescue dogs.\n\nThat is why we are still scratching our heads, over how he came to be with us.\n\nCan you believe this guy got tossed out of a truck, that then took off, with \nSnoozer in full on pursuit,until he just couldn't go anymore???\n\nWE CAN'T EITHER.\n\nNot that dumping a dog in this fashion is EVER ok but we keep waiting to see some difficult or annoying behavior that might have led to someone doing such a thing...and so far, there just aren't any.  He is a super cool guy.\n\nSo let's get down to it.  We named him Snoozer because one of our volunteers lives in the area Snoozer was abandoned.  Witnesses had seen him get dumped and the next day, our volunteer just happened to see Snoozer walking by her house.  What could she do?  She opened the door and invited him in and he was only too happy to make himself at home, where he laid down and slept for most of the rest of the day, exhausted from his ordeal.\n\nSo we named him Snoozer.\n\nBut he's not a fuddy-duddy, couch potato.  While he does indeed, enjoy his couch time and bed time and nap time and movie time, he's got great energy and ability to go on hikes, walks, adventures, car rides, road trips, you name it.  Snoozers down.  That is why he likes his naps.  You just never know when you might need to expend all that saved up energy.\n\nSnoozer is about 2-3 years old, judging by his teeth and weighed in at 29lbs.  He is in good weight and done growing so you can count on him to stay this size throughout his life, unless you treat too often or feed too much.  We think he is probably a mix of beagle and lab with some terrier of some sort thrown in to lift those ears up a bit but whatever it is, it came together to make a perfectly sized, perfectly handsome, very affectionate and easy going, all around, good guy.\n\nSnoozer does fine on a leash, lives happily with an array of dog genders and sizes, does fine with the cats in the home and has had minimal potty accidents, though we would hesitate to call him 100% housebroken.  He will bark at passing dogs but is not a loud or nuisance barker.  He travels well in a car, loves people of all kinds so bring on the family.  We have not tested him with toddlers or infants but humans six and over, will be adored.\n\nSo if you have been looking for a new BFF, partner in crime, side kick extraordinaire, look no further.  Snoozer is your guy and he is going to make some lucky person, couple or family, an amazing companion.\n\nIf you would like to meet this amazing little dude, please go to our website at www.allmuttsgreatandsmall.org/adoption and submit the adoption application.  If approved, well make arrangements for you to come meet him, to see if there's a spark.\n\nSnoozer is neutered, microchipped, has had his rabies vaccination and is up to date on his five way vaccinations.  He has been fecal checked and treated for internal bugs and treated for external ones.  All he needs is the promise of forever.  He would like to be sure that when he gets in a car or a truck for a fun ride, that is what he will get, and then be brought back home to share the couch, a good movie and a box of Cheese-Nips.\n\nHis adoption fee is $275\n\nPlease note:\n\n*Inquiries submitted through Petfinder, are not the same as applications \n  submitted through our webpage.  \n*Yes we do out of state adoptions.\n*No, we do not transport. You must be willing to come and meet the dog and \n  take it home with you.\n*Yes we do Canadian adoptions.\n*If the dog is on Petfinder, it is still available.\n*You must be 18 years of age to adopt\n*If you submit questions about an adoptable dog, covered in the Petfinder bio, \n we will not respond.\n*We do not pick the first good application.  We pick the most suitable \n  application for the dog, out of all submitted.\n*All correspondence is handled via email as time allows.  \n* If you are not chosen, you will not be notified\n\nFor a more detailed explanation of our adoption process, go to www.allmuttsgreatandsmall.org/adoption and read \"The Adoption Process\" link",

            "description": "About one year old and 35 lbs, Erwin is a fun happy young fella that is a perfect size for cuddles and travel, but not too small to miss out on more active adventures. He may have a little bit of growing left to do, but unlikely too much more if any at all. He's got long legs that would be perfect for running or climbing up onto your lap to snuggle. Still being young, Erwin would surely benefit from a home interested in giving him some proper guidance and structure to mold him into the ideal adult dog, a path he is well on his way down! He is quiet and sleeps well in his crate, gets along well with other dogs, and is adorably affectionate with volunteers. He will go to the door to signal he needs to go potty and walks well on a leash. If you'd like to meet Erwin, don't delay in getting in your adoption request!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

PLEASE COMPLETE OUR ADOPTION APPLICATION INSTEAD*\n\nMeet Sensational Sophie-NC!\n\nSophie is in an IDOG foster home in Gastonia-NC. Please read ALL the information in her listing before applying for her. If you would like to be considered as a potential adopter for her, please complete our adoption application at http://www.idogrescue.com/adoption_application \n(copy/paste the URL into your browser). \n\nIf you have completed an application in the last 3 months and meet the requirements for his new home, you can email us at rescue@idogrescue.com and let us know you are interested in Sophie.\n\nWe will review your application and let you know if you made our short list of applicants. We base our adoption decisions on what is in the best interest of our dogs. Please note our adoption policies are in place for the safety and welfare of our dogs - your understanding is appreciated.\n\nWe are all volunteers and have jobs, families, pets of our own to care for - we do the best that we can to get back to you in a timely manner. We believe in taking time to go through our thorough process to try to match the dog with the best fit for that dog.\n\nOur adoption process may take 2-4 weeks:\n\u2022 You must be approved to adopt before we will schedule a meet and greet.\n\u2022 We expect approved adopters to visit her in her foster home within a short period of time of being approved to adopt her.\n\u2022 Our adoption process involves vet and personal reference checks, phone interviews, a home visit, an adoption contract and an adoption fee.\n\n*AGE: 15 months (born October 2019)\n\n*WEIGHT: 59 lbs.\n\n*FENCE REQUIREMENT: A physical secure fence is required. No electronic fence or e-collar will be allowed as we feel this would not set her up for success.\n\n*COAT TYPE: Long straight moderate shedding coat. Her new family should be prepared to brush her daily and have her groomed every 6-8 weeks. This is approximately $100 per groom.\n\n*ENERGY LEVEL: high puppy. When she first sees you, she gets really excited but calms down very quickly.  She will need daily exercise, socialization and training to work on manners.\n\n*DOGS: She has lived with a dog her whole life so she may do best in a home with another dog. She does well with other dogs and would do well with a patient dog who can tolerate her puppy antics.  \n\n*CATS: unknown. She has had no exposure. \n\n*KIDS: 8+. Her prior owner told us she does great with children but may jump on young children and accidentally knock them down.\n\n*CAR: will get car sick if she eats right before going in car. Otherwise she rides in the car very well.\n\n*CRATE: she will go in crate at night when you are home with no issues. Does not enjoy crate if left alone and will destroy the crate.  She is in crate at night for about 8-9 hours with no issues.  She has been left alone for about 6-8 hours in the house with no issues although she would much rather be next to you than in the crate. \n\n*HOUSE TRAINED: yes!\n\n*LEASH: Sophie likes going for walks and needs more training on leash to walk loosely.\n\nHere's what Sophie\u2019s foster parent has to say about her:\n\nSophie is a 15 month old 59 lb. female Goldendoodle who was surrendered to IDOG by her family who wanted her to get more attention and exercise than they were able to provide. \n\nAre you looking for a Valentine that sticks to you like Velcro and follows you everywhere?  Then Sophie is your gal! \n\nSophie is sweet like honey, fun-loving, and her personality shines!  Sophie needs a home with a fenced yard and family that will be home the majority of the day or one she can be with. Sophie spent the majority of her day in her prior home living outside during the day so inside living is a whole new world for Sophie and she is thriving.\n\nShe has some separation anxiety and would do better in a home where humans are home regularly or she can go with them. Sophie is a young pup who wants to please!  She loves attention and giving hugs and is a great companion. Her temperament is very sweet, loving, gentle, and playful.  She is skittish and a bit fearful in new situations and will need patience and continued training and socialization. She is still a puppy so she should learn quickly.  \n\nThe ideal home for Sophie is one where someone is home most of the day as she would much rather be next you than in a crate.  She will follow you around everywhere and lay right next to you.  She likes to play fetch and go on walks.  She will need someone who is patient and willing to work with her on socialization and manners. She is a bit slow to warm up to people and may growl initially due to her lack of socialization but does warm up. She has shown no aggression whatsoever. \n\nShe would do well in a home with another dog that is patient. She has always had another dog in her home so would likely be more successful in a home with another dog.  She needs daily exercise to keep her energy at a good level.  \n\nShe loves tennis balls, tug-o-war, ice, frisbee, Benebones. She also has gone hiking with her foster and loved it.\n\nSophie is spayed, up to date on vaccines, microchipped, and house trained. She is heartworm and fecal negative and on heartworm/flea and tick preventatives.\n\nADOPTION FEE: $495\n\nOUR ADOPTION FEES RANGE FROM $100 - $750 depending on the dog. The following is a general guide, but each dog is assessed individually. It currently costs IDOG an average of over $400 for basic vet, grooming, and foster care on each dog; that does not allow for the ones who get sick, need surgery, have special needs, or are heartworm positive.\n\nADOPTION FEES:\nUnder 6 months $550 and up\n6 months to 2 years $450 and up\n2 years - 4 years $350 and up\n4 years + $100 and up\nSpecial Needs fee/donation assessed on individual basis\n\nTO APPLY FOR THIS DOG, PLEASE COMPLETE THE APPLICATION ON OUR WEBSITE:\nhttp://www.idogrescue.com/adoption_application\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I weigh roughly 40lbs.\nRescued from a shelter then adopted out, I am again, in need of a home. It seems like I was just too big or just too energetic for my adopters so they didn't want me anymore! \nI am a nice girl for sure! Being kind and friendly to other dogs and humans, I have a very soft way about me. \n\n With my adorable looks, and unbridled loyalty, I will always be there for you through thick and thin. I will never judge you, or turn my back on you. Every single day, you will look at me and you will know that you are loved unconditionally. I will never betray you or hurt you, and I will grow old by your side.\n\n******IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ ALL THE GREAT INFO BELOW******\n\n***Please don't apply unless you are very serious about adopting, and are ready to move forward with the adoption process. We are super busy and make a great effort to respond back to EVERYONE ASAP! WHEN WE TAKE THE TIME TO PROCESS AN APPLICATION AND RESPOND BACK TO THE APPLICANT JUST TO BE EITHER IGNORED OR BE TOLD THEY CANNOT COME FOR SEVERAL DAYS, MORE TIME IS WASTED~PLEASE HAVE MORE RESPECT THAN THAT!\n\nPLEASE read our website's ADOPTION PROCESS PAGE prior to submitting an adoption application. www.apupspizzazzrescue.com/adoption-process \nADOPTION APPLICATION: www.apupspizzazzrescue.com/adoption-application \n\nABOUT OUR RESCUE DOGS: \n All of our dogs are located in Connecticut, are spayed or neutered, up to date on vaccines, microchipped, have been given deworming medications, and have had CT State health checks, & go home with a leash, collar, & packet of medical paperwork. \n\nBREED IDENTIFICATION:\nPlease understand that many rescue dogs are mixes of multiple breeds. Petfinder allows us to choose up to two breeds per dog. While the shelters and our rescue do our best in accurately identifying breeds, breed identification is not guaranteed. If there is a certain breed that you do not want, it is very important that you share this with our rescue when applying. When adopting a puppy, breed uncertainty plays a big part in the size/look of the dog as an adult. Please know that any puppy can be a wonderful dog, regardless of preconceived notions of certain breeds, but it is very important that the adopter has the dedication and patience to raise the puppy with boundaries, consistency, structure, & love. The more effort you give towards training & time you allow for exercise, your puppy will grow to be a HUGE source of UNCONDITIONAL LOVE, TOTAL LOYALTY, HAPPINESS, COMFORT & COMPANIONSHIP!\n\nABOUT OUR RESCUE:\nWe are a small rescue run by volunteers & focused on finding the right match for both our dogs & for you. If you are interested in adopting through our rescue, you first will need to complete an adoption application & be approved as a potential adopter before meeting any of our pups. No need to be intimidated by our application as it allows us to get to know you & your lifestyle. Of course, the more you can share the better! Please also note, while a fenced yard is fantastic, it is not required by our rescue, however, it may be required for a certain dog occasionally.  Once adoption applicants are approved to become potential adopters, we offer private appointments where you can meet one or several dogs at the discretion of the rescue. We offer a unique & pleasant experience focused on finding the perfect match. It is extremely important to us that everyone is treated with respect & that NO ONE IS LEFT HANGING. WE WILL GET BACK TO YOU WITHIN 2 TO 3 DAYS of application submission. If there is a dog you are eager to meet, please  TEXT US DIRECTLY at 203-241-2351 so that we can check the status of your application and move it forward immediately. We look forward to hearing from you and helping you find your new best friend.\n\n*All adult dogs can be cat tested by request.\n\nHOME/RENTER INSURANCE:\nSOME PROVIDERS HAVE VERY STRICT POLICIES REGARDING WHICH TYPE OF DOG BREEDS ARE ALLOWED UNDER THEIR COVERAGE. STATE FARM WAS SUGGESTED TO US AS THEY DO NOT PUNISH, DROP, NOR REFUSE YOU DUE TO DOG BREED SHOULD YOU RUN INTO ISSUES WITH YOUR CURRENT PROVIDER.",

We won him over with treats he took with a soft mouth.  He loves peanut butter Kongs.\n\nKaiser turned out to be a playful gentle giant who now barks for attention.\n\nHe chases and juggles the ball.\n\nKaiser has just had a week of  training with Margaret Blair at Twin Cedars Canine.\n\nHe  knows or has been introduced to: loose lead, heel, auto sit, down, stay and come.\n\nHe waits for his food and doorways. Without distractions he is good for all.\n\nKaiser\u2019s \"big issue\" is that he escapes his fence; he does not like to be confined.\n\nHer becomes overstimulated and reactive when he sees other dogs; \n\nper Margaret, his behavior around other dogs appears to be excitement.\n\nIf you have another dog, a \u201cmeet \u2019n greet\" is required.\n\nDue to his size, older children would be best.\n\nThis very affectionate boy loves people and is eager to go home with you now.",

            "description": "Quinn (the mom) and her litter of pups arrived in our care when the pups were less than 10 days old.  The litter is now 8 weeks old and the pups are ready for adoption.  We do not know their actual breed mix but mom has a shepherd appearance.  They are likely mixed with several breeds and will be at least medium when full grown.  Some could end up larger though.  Its hard for us to know at this age.  They are active pups and will need active homes with plenty of time for outside exercise and play time.  They will also benefit from obedience training so they can be the best companions ever.  \n\nPlease do breed research before adopting any pup - make sure your type of home and lifestyle is the right fit for the activity level and needs of the particular breeds mentioned as a possible mix in our rescue pups.  Keep in mind though that we can only guess the breed(s) we think we see in the pups we rescue.   Without knowing the background information on them and exactly what breed(s) their parents are, its just an educated guess on our parts.\n\nOur puppy adoption fee is $150.00 each and our pups have been spayed/neutered, wormed, vaccinated for kennel cough and have received their first parvo/distemper shot. We require a fenced yard or if you live in the country safe acreage on your own land for exercise. Our dogs must be allowed in their family home and be allowed to sleep inside of the home at night. At adoption you will be required to complete and sign an adoption contract. \n\nWe are located in Billings, Montana and require adopters to travel to our location.  \n\nIf you would like to inquire about adopting this pup or have questions, please contact foster mom Stacee at 406-208-3853.",

            "description": "Quinn (the mom) and her litter of pups arrived in our care when the pups were less than 10 days old.  The litter is now 8 weeks old and the pups are ready for adoption.  We do not know their actual breed mix but mom has a shepherd appearance.  They are likely mixed with several breeds and will be at least medium when full grown.  Some could end up larger though.  Its hard for us to know at this age.  They are active pups and will need active homes with plenty of time for outside exercise and play time.  They will also benefit from obedience training so they can be the best companions ever.  \n\nPlease do breed research before adopting any pup - make sure your type of home and lifestyle is the right fit for the activity level and needs of the particular breeds mentioned as a possible mix in our rescue pups.  Keep in mind though that we can only guess the breed(s) we think we see in the pups we rescue.   Without knowing the background information on them and exactly what breed(s) their parents are, its just an educated guess on our parts.\n\nOur puppy adoption fee is $150.00 each and our pups have been spayed/neutered, wormed, vaccinated for kennel cough and have received their first parvo/distemper shot. We require a fenced yard or if you live in the country safe acreage on your own land for exercise. Our dogs must be allowed in their family home and be allowed to sleep inside of the home at night. At adoption you will be required to complete and sign an adoption contract. \n\nWe are located in Billings, Montana and require adopters to travel to our location.  \n\nIf you would like to inquire about adopting this pup or have questions, please contact foster mom Stacee at 406-208-3853.",

I'm a special needs kind of guy, because I can't see, and I have urinary issues. I do let you know when I have to potty but can't always make it out the door. I will have to always have a belly band on so I don't wet on the floor. I can't see so I need to be in a home with adult and/or older children. I currently live with two cats, they don't hang around me too much and we get along fine. I do great in the the car, and on a leash. At night I like to snuggle up either under the covers or on top. I also like to bury my nose in the covers while sleeping, my foster family thinks it's adorable. They say I'm a good boy and well behaved. I do have some anxiety but that comes with my breed. My medication helps me out. I cry/whimper when I'm hungry or need to go potty. I recently had a dental and had a lot of teeth removed. My mouth feels better and my breath is better, but I will need to be on soft food. If you are interested in meeting me go to www.adopthope.org and my foster mom will get in touch with you. Chico's adoption fee is $200 and includes his neuter, microchip and current vaccinations and preventatives plus a free basic obedience course at Cedar Run Pet Boarding in Hiawatha. Last Hope requires that all animals be kept as indoor pets only, be altered and current on vaccinations and preventatives. Our adoption process includes reference and background checks, a vet check and a home visit.",

Those emails will not be answered.\nAdoption fees for NY dogs is $800 as we are having to use a cargo flying company to bring in the dogs from China. $800 does actually not cover the whole cost. We are fundraising the rest. We don't know the exact breeds of the dogs, so we guess based on their appearance.\n\nRuyi is a stray dog from China. She is 1 year old and 22 pounds.\nShe is very docile and quiet and sweet with other dogs. She is super loving and gentle.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out the form here:\n\nhttps://homeboundhoundz.com/application-form",

            "description": "Zina. Zina is a German Shepherd/Hound mix, one year-old, and spayed. She is loving, snuggly, loyal, smart, playful, and highly active. She makes a great guard dog and will flourish in a home with ROOM to run:  a big yard, near the woods, etc.  After a long walk, she settles down fine the rest of the day, and she loves to cuddle up on the couch. \nZina gets along with other dogs after calm introductions. She has never met a cat, but definitely seems like she wants to chase them, so a cat-free home would probably be best. She has been exposed to a few children, but perhaps a home with older or no children might be better. But she is very friendly and curious, so could be adaptable. \nSome of her challenging traits are that, as a guard dog, she barks and gets excited with postmen, visitors, etc. She is excitable on walks, wanting to hunt, smell, and meet other dogs. Although she is 50#, she seems to have the energy and strength of an 80# dog! She's a pistol.\nShe'll thrive in a home with a patient assertive owner who is dedicated to training her, exercising her regularly, and wanting a protective loyal companion.\nIf you or someone you know are looking for a high energy dog with lots of love and loyalty to give, Zina may be your pup contact adalovesdogs@gmail.com",

Those emails will not be answered.\nAdoption fees for NY dogs is $800 as we are having to use a cargo flying company to bring in the dogs from China. $800 does actually not cover the whole cost. We are fundraising the rest. We don't know the exact breeds of the dogs, so we guess based on their appearance.\n\nLisa is a stray from China. She is 4 years old and 14 pounds. Here is what the China rescue says:\n\nLisa\u2019s spleen was necrotic, and the uterus was necrotic, so surgery was performed on August 5,2020to remove the spleen and uterus.\nShe has recovered well.\nLisa has a gentle personality and is a particularly obedient dog. During her hospitalization, doctors and nurses loved her. She cherishes her current life, she is very close to people and friendly to other dogs.\n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out the form here:\n\nhttps://homeboundhoundz.com/application-form",

Clementine is a bit shy in her new environment and needs a secure home where she feels safe. She is the more svelte of the two sisters.  \n\nAll our dogs are spayed/neutered, de-wormed, vaccinated appropriate for their age, vaccinated for kennel cough, and micro-chipped. Puppies (under 6 months) are $225.00; puppies (6 months to 2 years) are $175.00, dogs (over 2 years) are $150 and senior dogs (7 years or older) are $60.00.\n\nOur application is on our front page of Petfinder, on the middle, right-hand side under our logo.

Those emails will not be answered.\nAdoption fees for NY dogs is $800 as we are having to use a cargo flying company to bring in the dogs from China. $800 does actually not cover the whole cost. We are fundraising the rest. We don't know the exact breeds of the dogs, so we guess based on their appearance.\n\nLibby and Rose are a bonded pair. They must be adopted together. Libby is 4 years old and Rose is 1 year old.\nThey are mother and daughter. Libby, the blonde, is the mother. The rescuer said: I had tears,  every time I saw them searching in a trash can for food, it makes me heartbroken. \nLibby has a docile personality, especially close to people, likes to hug people, especially likes to stay with her daughter, and sleep together.\nRose was afraid of people in the beginning, timid, but is now happy and lively. Without her mother, she would feel very lost. They are so cute together.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out the form here:\n\nhttps://homeboundhoundz.com/application-form",

Please complete a pre-adoption application at https://redemptionroadrescue.rescuegroups.org/forms/form?formid=4003.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: We expect a high volume of interest in this puppy, so please be patient with us as we review all applications. As a foster-based rescue, we don't have a facility for visits with multiple animals. Meet & greets with dogs are arranged one the pre-adoption application has been received, processed, reviewed, AND approved.\n\nFor Puppies adoption fee is $450.00 for the age appropriate vetting they have had so far. (2 DHPP vaccines, deworming on a schedule, and will come with microchip) Puppies still need: 1-2 more DHPP vaccines and a rabies on an age appropriate schedule, and eventual spay or neuter (recommended when closer to 5 1/2- 6 months old) If you want the puppy altered with our vet, the adoption fee is $650.00 (adopter is responsible for the in between vaccines). If you want to alter (spay or neuter) your puppy at your vet, the adoption fee is $450.00, and we ask you to sign a spay/neuter contract and will need to show proof of S/N at later date.\n\nredemptionroad.mn@gmail.com\n\nhttp://redemptionroadrescue.rescuegroups.org\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/RedemptionRoadRescue (Message us!)\n\nAll animals fully vetted appropriate for age:\nSpayed or Neutered\nRabies vaccine\nDHPP vaccine\n4DX test (@12 months or older)\nMicrochipped\nDewormed\nFlea/tick prevention",

As a result of living this life, she is shy when she first meets new humans and dogs. But once she is comfortable, she is the sweetest thing ever and loves to snuggle.\nNessy is playful and wants to be with her humans but she does okay when left alone too - she says just don't leave me alone for long, I want to be included in the fun!\nNessy is good with other dogs, kids and adults! We don't know about cats. Due to being left alone in a car for long periods of time (including during very cold weather), Nessy was a bit behind in understanding what housetraining is all about, but she is smart and working on learning with the help of her foster family. Her new family will need to continue that work to help her succeed.\nAs with all AC PAW pets, Nessy is spayed, fully vaccinated, microchipped and certified fully lovable! If you are interested in being considered for Nessy, please fill out our pre-adoption form at: https://acpaw.wufoo.com/forms/q18s4vtj0jnnt1t/\nIf you are interested in adopting this AC PAW pet or would like to set up a meet-and-greet please fill out our pre-adoption questionnaire at acpaw.org.",

We are fundraising the rest. We don't know the exact breeds of the dogs, so we guess based on their appearance.\n\nTiger is a stray dog from China. He is 2 years old and 14 pounds. \nHe was found all alone, soaked from the rain. He followed the rescuer home.\nHe is such a cute little guy. He is very happy and friendly.

            "description": "Tierney is a sweet easy-going adult hound about 45 lbs. She gets along just fine with dogs of all sizes on the farm but isn't necessarily looking for a playmate. She would love to find a home with a fenced yard where she can lounge in a sunbeam and sniff all the smells 'till her heart's content. She's not high maintenance in the slightest and it won't take much more than some head scratches and yummy treats to make her tail wag. Tierney is truly just the sweetest hound dog and will make a wonderful buddy for some lucky someone. Get in your application to meet this sweet girl!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace!

He greets everyone (dog and human alike) with tail wags and loves to be petted and loved on! Ear massages are the best!! He is unbothered by cats and sleeps beautifully in his crate. Ranger doesn't always have on his listening ears, but treats help him follow commands. Breakfast and dinner are his favorite times of day! You won't hear a single bark unless you count a couple of really cute ones while he is dreaming. We're not sure of the life he came from, but Ranger would be so grateful for a bone to chew, lots of pets, and a soft place to lay his sweet head. If you'd love to give those to him, get in your adoption request to meet Ranger today!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time.

My owner never claimed me so I was relinquished to Halfway to Home so I could be adopted by my forever family. I am a sweet, friendly and playful boy who walks well on a leash. My ideal owners will be active people who take part in outdoor adventures like jogging, hiking, and camping. I am still a pup so it is important that I receive house- and obedience-training to help me learn proper behavior and to help me bond with you. A home with a fenced-yard where I can safely run around and play is essential. When I'm done exercising for the day, I want to be in the house where I am treated like part of the family. I don't know how I will do with other dogs, cats, or children so when we meet we can find out together. I am confident I will make a loving and loyal companion. If you would like to find out more information about me, or would like to make an appointment to meet me, please call Sandy at tele# 661-824-4495 (landline). Thanks for reading, see you soon!",

Approximately 4 years old and an extreme cuddle bug who is especially drawn to belly rubs.  \n\nHe is an excellent guard dog with a strong sense of property.  Greets friends and acquaintances with a wagging tail when they visit but is wary of strangers.  \n\nFranky has some separation anxiety and would be best in a home where someone is typically around.   Would probably love a full family but happy with one person he can bond with.  Probably not good in a household with cats.  \n\nLoves just about any activity but not drawn to fetching or swimming.  Great in a canoe or on a bike leash.  \nApply for Ginger at tmldogrescue.com",

Duke is around 3 months old and will probably grow up to be the size of a German Shephard.  He'll need a home with a fenced yard and we ask for veterinary references.\n\nThe adoption fee is $165 and includes a voucher to get him neutered when he's 6 months old. The voucher will be mailed to his new family.\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION:\nTo meet Duke call/text Gabi at 803-640-7523 or email - gabi.esslinger@gmail.com\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY:\nAge: born around 11/1/2020\nWeight: 20 pounds\nDA2PPv vaccine: 1st: 1/30/21\nBordetella Vaccine: 1/15/21\nNeoPar Parvo Vaccine: 1/15/21\nWorming: Panacur: 1/19/21 x 5 days\nHeartworm Prevention: Milbeguard: 1/15/21\nFlea Prevention: Activyl: 1/15/21\nMicrochipped: 24 HR Pet Watch\n\nrb: ge\n\nrev: ge 1/30/21",

Those emails will not be answered.\nAdoption fees for NY dogs is $800 as we are having to use a cargo flying company to bring in the dogs from China. $800 does actually not cover the whole cost. We are fundraising the rest. We don't know the exact breeds of the dogs, so we guess based on their appearance.\n\nS is a stray dog from China. Panda is one of Flora's puppies. She is 8 months old. She will probably max out at about 20-25 pounds.\nWhen Panda was rescued, she was severely malnourished and dehydrated.  She is a miracle dog. She is very friendly, likes to stay with people,  Very quiet, barely barks, but super lively and kind of awkward in a cute way. She gets along well with other dogs.\n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out the form here:\n\nhttps://homeboundhoundz.com/application-form",

            "description": "Meet Shooby! Shooby is a goofy 3 year old Pit-Mix snuggle bug. When he is not cuddling, he loves to play chase, tug, and chew on his toys. Shobby also loves to run free, so his ideal forever home would have a fenced in backyard for his zoomies. Shooby loves his foster fur sister and parents, but he is scared of new things, people, and animals, so he needs to take new introductions very slowly. While Shooby loves the people he knows and his fur foster sibling, Shooby does best with a routine and around people that can read his cues and give him space when he asks for it. Because of this, we recommend that he is adopted to a home that has another dog and kids 15 and up. Shooby is particularly nervous of new things when on leash, so a home with a fenced yard where he does not need to be walked often is a requirement. He may take some time to trust you, but once he does he quickly makes up for the wait with love and laughs!\n\nThe adoption donation for Shooby is $300.  This donation helps to cover veterinary expenses including spay/neuter, microchip and vaccinations.\n\nWish Upon a Rescue is a 501(c)3 non-profit, foster based animal rescue. If you would like to meet Shooby, please complete our adoption questionnaire at www.wishuponarescue.org/adopt. We will review your responses and be in contact to schedule a meet and greet at a time and place convenient for your family and our team members.",

She is a really cute little lab maybe dachshund mix weighing in at 9 lbs at 9 weeks, so she should be 45- 50 lbs full grown. She has a really cool coat sorta black and brown. She is very sweet and loves to be right next to you. She would be great for any family because she is very sweet and gentle.

            "description": "So today is Bobby's big debut as an available guy. He has came so far since Sunday. While his past has been unthinkable for most of us, his has a bright future ahead of him. He is about 7 yrs old. He is a mixed breed rescue. He is not very big, probably 25-30 pounds. He is up to date on shot and microchipped. He is not neutered so there is a $100 refundable deposit that is returned when he is neutered. He loves everyone he meets. A little shy at first but warms up very fast. Sometimes he loves a little too much so probably best with older kids because he just doesn\u2019t understand gentle yet. He has not met any kids here so not sure about smaller humans. He has never had an accident since he has been here. He does very good inside but loves it outdoors. Bobby has been good with our small dogs and the cat. We will miss him dearly when he leaves but very excited for his future. His adoption fee is $250 which is being sponsored in honor of our much loved and lost way too soon, baby Belle. Reminder He is not neutered so there is a $100 refundable deposit that is returned when he is neutered.\nHe is being fostered in Tomah WI\nApply for him at www.lastpawrescue.org\n\u201c501(c) 3 approved WI Agriculture license number 285589-DS\u201d",

She weighs around 8lbs.\n\nBell was an amazing mama to her 6 puppies but she is ready to be a dog & enjoy her life! She has the CUTEST smile when she is excited & does a little dance. She loves being held & will roll over for belly rubs! She is also independent & will keep herself busy. She loves to follow you around & will seriously melt in your arms. She will need continued leash/harness training. She is working on potty training. She gets along with other dogs, men, women & kids. We are unsure about cats.\n\nShe is available through our \"Pathway to Home\" program. Please complete an adoption application at www.pathwaysforpaws.com if Bell is the missing piece to your family!",

In playgroup Dempsey gets along well with the other dogs and likes to play racing gladiators (they race around the yard and into each other). He is currently receiving basic obedience training with Dog Trainer Kenyon Evers. He is very sweet and likes affection after he has played. We are currently using him as an assessment dog to see if new dogs like meeting new canine friends, given that Dempsey is always up for meeting new friends. Dempsey would love to have a home and more importantly a yard to call his own.",

They had their Spay, Neuter, Microchip,\u00a0 Heartworm Test (negative ?) and Vaccines, and rabies shot to get them all ready to meat their new adopters. They are such sweet little dogs that love to cuddle and play in the yard. We've yet to hear them bark.\u00a0 Dave can be shy when meeting strangers, but he's learning to trust. Wendy is friendly and adores attention. Each dog's adoption fee is $250.They will make excellent family additions.\nPlease Visit kathisk9s.org for Applications!!",

We update our website daily just so you will know the status right away).  PLEASE GO TO OUR WEBSITE for up to date information to find out.  Check the Gallery by putting your mouse on the photo. \nIF it says Pending, we chose someone, but they haven't met up yet.  If it says Adopted, then the dog has been happily united with a forever family.  IF nothing is there other than their name, they are still available.\n\nAPPLY if interested so you can be considered.?\n\n*Our page is updated daily. Please go to www.wowdogrescue.org for any updates.\n\nThor is approx. 4 lb.  Most likely a Jack Russel/Chi/ and Maltese mix puppy.\n(Basing this on what the other pups look like).  He was found in a box in an alley with 3 other puppies.  The lady that found them went door to door asking if they knew who these pups belonged too...but no one seemed to know. One neighbor wanted 1 of them and the 3 came to our rescue.  They are now 13 weeks old and are being vetted and spay/neutered.  Thor is scheduled for Feb 16th to be neutered.\n\nThor is a sweetheart., and he loves to cuddle. He knows when he gets his sweater on that it is time to go for a car ride, which he loves.\n\nThor is learning to play fetch with a tennis ball.  He is still working on being potty trained, so has a few accidents.\n\nThor has super soft fur, and about 1/\" long.  ?Thor will follow you around and lay down where ever you are and if he cannot see you he is up looking for you.  Thor enjoys chewing on a bully stick and does fine in a large play Xpen during the day while the fosters are gone to work. Night time he sleeps in bed with the fosters.\n\nThor is eating solid food.\n\nThor will be neutered, puppy shot series, Bordetella and Microchipped by 2/16/21 Thor's adoption fee is set at $275.00\n\nWE ARE NOT PETFINDER, WE ARE NOT ADOPTAPET OR RESCUE ME.  Our application is on our website:  www.wowdogrescue.org  ?**PLEASE do not call or email to see if he is \"still\" available.His Gallery photo on our website will be updated daily and will state his status.  IF we have chosen someone, he will be marked \"Pending\".  IF he has been adopted, he will be marked \"Adopted\".\n\n***Tired of not finding, or not being chosen for the dog of your dream?? \n Consider Fostering with us...Our Fosters have 1st chance at adopting the dog they foster, while we pay for everything.  Its a win win for both! YOU get to see if this is a good match for your family, while the dog is being loved in your home...",

Those emails will not be answered.\nAdoption fees for NY dogs is $800 as we are having to use a cargo flying company to bring in the dogs from China. $800 does actually not cover the whole cost. We are fundraising the rest. We don't know the exact breeds of the dogs, so we guess based on their appearance.\n\nFlora is a stray from China. she is 1 and a half years old.\nShe was abandoned after the owner moved to a new house. She has been wandering around the property of the house. At the end of May 2020, she gave birth to 4 puppies. She was rescued on July 16, 2020. At that time, the two puppies were seriously malnourished. 1 died. Her three puppies are Tangerine, Panda, and  Da Vinc. \nFlora is a very good dog mother. After she was rescued, she regurgitated her food to feed her puppies.\nFlora is a border collie mix. She has a gentle personality, very quiet, not barking, good with other dogs. \nShe is a Docile, friendly to people, and very smart. She listens well.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out the form here:\n\nhttps://homeboundhoundz.com/application-form",

He is crate and house trained.   He walks well on a leash and is good with other dogs. He wants no confrontation with a grumpy dog and backs off but is always ready to rumble and play with his puppy dog pals. \n\nOakley can sit and has great recall and loves to be by your side. His foster feels he will be a great off leash walking or hiking partner eventually after bonding with his new family. He is good with all ages but lots of little noisy kiddos screaming and running makes him nervous so a home with children 12 and older would be a better match. \n\nOakley is 2 to 3 years old and is a Plott Hound mix and weighs 40 lbs.   He is neutered, micro-chipped and up to date on vaccines.   he is located in Houston, TX and will come to his new home on professional ground transport.   If you feel you could give Oakley a loving forever home please contact Freedom Street Rescue at rhondabarron@earthlink.net for an app or go online to www.freedomstreetrescue.org",

She is an 8 month old hound mix. Sugar is a little head shy at first but she's still learning to be a dog. Men make her a little nervous but eventually she warms up pretty quickly with the right introduction. Sugar has really bonded to some of her caretakers because they have given her the patience and love she really needs. She can be nervous around strangers but as soon as she sees someone she knows, she gets so excited. Could you be that person that Sugar can bond with?\n\nOne of the amazing staff members at Jefferson Feed is helping her learn basic obedience commands. She knows sit, down, kennel and is learning stay. She is also house broken. Sugar is good with other dogs but she tends to play a little rough since she's still learning the ropes of being a dog so a proper meet and greet will be needed if you have other dogs. She seems to chase the store cats so maybe a home without cats would be best. Her adoption fee is $67. She also tested negative for heartworms. Please email Martha, our dog adoption coordinator at cajunlassie78@att.net for an adoption application or more information about Sugar.",

If there are multiple applications for a puppy, after all home checks are done, then the puppy is adopted out to the home that is the best fit for that puppy.\n***** All breeds listed are a best guess or based on information from our rescue partners and are not guaranteed*****\n \n ******Chicagoland Dog Rescue reserves the right to restrict adoption of a dog to potential adopters who live within a fifty (50) mile radius of Schaumburg, IL *****\n\nHello!!!! My name is Daisy and I am an energetic pup who loves lots of attention and plenty of play!  My ideal home would have lots of love to give, patience \u2018cause I might make some mistakes and I am TEETHING, and time to work on training with me so I can be even more AMAZING!  I am crate trained and will go in with no problems at all AND I am almost totally housebroken, which is pretty good for someone as young as me!  Even being from the south has not stopped this girl from loving the snow.  AND toys!  Love toys!!!  And I have a turkey flavored bone which is pretty great,too!   But being young means I have lots to learn and keeping all four on the floor is one of those things!  If you would like to meet me, please fill out a pre adoption application and a CDR volunteer will get back to you just as quick as they can!\nTail wags and kisses-Daisy\n\n\n\n**The ADOPTION FEE for this pet is $450 which includes getting the puppy/dog up to date on rabies, distemper and bordetella vaccines, fecal test and deworming if necessary, heartworm test, spay or neuter (not including pre-surgical bloodwork) and a microchip. Free access to our weekly training classes is also included for the life of the dog, something no other rescue in the area offers.***",

Submit an application from our website and then make an appointment to meet her.\n\nDelphine is not eligible for foster and will be a straight adoption.\n\nAge: ~1 years \nWeight: ~51lbs (should gain some)\nHousebroken: Yes\nCrate trained: Working on it! Takes some time to settle, but overall doing well with her crate training\nDog sociability: Friendly with dogs on walks! Is eager to meet them and may pull to say 'hi!'\nCat sociability: Unknown\nKids: Friendly with kids! Can be a little jumpy/excited when first greeting people. \nIdeal home: Delphine is a pretty adaptable gal! As an adolescent pup, she would like an adopter that is committed to working on training and helping her to exhaust her energy in positive ways.\n\nLooking for the sweetest and most cuddly dog ever?!? You've found her with Delphine. She thinks she's a lap dog with the way she loves to cuddle with you. Delphine absolutely loves playing with other dogs and is super friendly with humans too! She is a huge fan of the belly rubs and getting all the pets. Take her out to your backyard or a nearby park and throw a tennis ball to see how fast she can run (you will be impressed!) Just don't ask her to bring the ball back - she hasn't mastered that part yet :)\n\nDelphine's adoption fee is 300. She is spayed, up to date on core vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative. She will require booster vaccines at the adopter's expense. \n\n***We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications. We ask that you please be patient and someone will be in touch via email within 72 hours. Please do not email us unless you have not received a response in 72 hours. Please only fill out one adoption application. ***",

Submit an application from our website and then make an appointment to meet him.\n\nNick is not eligible for foster and will be a straight adoption.\n\nAge: ~2 years \nWeight: ~52lbs\nHousebroken: Yes\nCrate trained: Takes time to settle (10-30 minutes) and would benefit from continued training for this. \nDog sociability: Reportedly dog-friendly and seems interested in saying 'hi!' when he sees dogs on walks - will pull to greet. \nCat sociability: Unknown\nKids: Unknown but can be mouthy (play bites) and shy/timid, so recommended for teenagers only\nIdeal home: Nick will prefer a home that can go slow with him as he is shy/timid of strangers at first, especially males. He is not a match for an elevator building or busy area, but is adaptable to other living environments. He has some good energy and would like an adopter that can continue to work on training and exhaust his energy in positive ways. \n\nNick is a dreamboat who will charm you with his soft floppy ears and very boopable nose! He is such a quick learner and would thrive with someone who wants to teach him lots of commands and exercise with him regularly. Walkies are LIFE. He knows \"sit\" and \"touch\" and is so close to nailing \"down.\" He really likes exploring and seems eager to meet dog friends along the way. While relaxing on the couch, Nick enjoys soft pets on his face and belly rubs, while being told he is the goodest most handsome pup in Chicagoland. \n\nNick's adoption fee is 300. He will be neutered on a future date (3/11 at SNIP Society) and a 50 refundable neuter deposit will be required. He is up to date on core vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative. He will require booster vaccines at the adopter's expense. \n\n***We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications. We ask that you please be patient and someone will be in touch via email within 72 hours. Please do not email us unless you have not received a response in 72 hours. Please only fill out one adoption application. ***",

            "description": "Wilbur is living in a foster home. Submit an application from our website and then make an appointment to meet him.\n\nWilbur is not eligible for foster and will be a straight adoption.\n\nAge: ~1.5 years\nWeight: ~42lbs\nHousebroken: Working on it! He needs to be kept to a strict schedule\nCrate trained: Working on it! Takes some time to settle (10-30 minutes) but overall doing well with his crate training\nDog sociability: Friendly with dogs on walks - may pull/whine/bark in excitement as he wants to greet other dogs. Has done great with other dogs off-leash in playgroup. Enjoys dogs that are his size and playful/active like himself. \nCat sociability: Unknown\nKids: Unknown, but we suspect he would do well. May be a little jumpy for very young kiddos, \nIdeal home: A home that can keep him busy both physically and mentally as he is an adolescent guy with some good energy!\n\nSmart, curious, extroverted VGB seeks active, patient human and possibly canine friend for life. Promises to follow you around the house, stare out the window for hours to appease his FOMO (fear of missing out), and give the best cuddles once he gets the zoomies out. Eager to please and very food motivated, Wilbur sits very pretty for the treats and will help immediately with any and all unattended breakfast. Runs a sub 10min mile without even trying and will still play fetch afterward. The cutest piggy snuffles and the biggest tail wags. Seeking mentally stimulating, active lifestyle to satisfy his curious mind, and a yard would be a huge bonus to help with the zoomies! \n\nWilbur's adoption fee is 300. He is neutered, up to date on core vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative. He will require booster vaccines at the adopter's expense. He was prescribed Doxycycline recently for a URI and we recommend his adopter follow up with their personal vet if his symptoms worsen. \n\n***We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications. We ask that you please be patient and someone will be in touch via email within 72 hours. Please do not email us unless you have not received a response in 72 hours. Please only fill out one adoption application. ***",

Submit an application from our website and then make an appointment to meet her.\n\nMissy is not eligible for foster and will be a straight adoption.\n\nAge: ~7 years \nWeight: ~54lbs (should lose some)\nHousebroken: Working on it! She needs to be on a strict schedule \nCrate trained: Takes some time (10-30 minutes) and would benefit from continued training for this.\nDog sociability: Missy is reportedly dog-friendly from her transferring shelter partner. In our care, she has been fine meeting dogs on walks but with some dogs she may growl or want to keep walking - may be a little selective, but overall we think she has potential to be fine with the right match.\nCat sociability: Unknown\nKids: Unknown, but can be body sensitive sometimes, so likely best with older kids/teenagers \nIdeal home: Missy is looking for a calm home that can keep her brain busy as she undergoes her heartworm treatment! \n\nMissy is the sweetest cuddle bug. She's happiest curling up on the couch with you and will do anything for belly scratches. She's a gentle chonky girl with the cutest underbite. She also recently acquired a new skill - STAIRS! She loves people and treats, and sometimes like to sit on the people who give her treats. She's here to live the relaxed life and will spend most of her time sleeping. She's very comfortable being in a home, but will want your attention when she's not sleeping. \n\nMissy is heartworm positive and will be undergoing treatment at our Ellis Veterinary Clinic. OTAT will cover the cost of her treatment until she is heartworm negative. They will need to remain on exercise restriction for the next ~9 months. For information on the heartworm treatment process, visit: onetail.org/heartworm\n\nMissy's adoption fee is 300. She is spayed, up to date on core vaccines, microchipped and heartworm positive.

Submit an application from our website and then make an appointment to meet him.\n\nKinnick is not eligible for foster and will be a straight adoption.\n\nAge: ~7 years \nWeight: ~95lbs (overweight and needs to lose some)\nHousebroken: Working on it! He needs to be on a strict schedule. \nCrate trained: Working on it! Takes some time to settle but overall doing well with his crate training\nDog sociability: Friendly. Lives with a dog in his foster home and has done well - he is more of a co-existor. On walks he can be barky and pulls when he sees smaller dogs.\nCat sociability: In his previous home (his home before OTAT) they noted that he was interested and never aggressive towards cats. We have not seen him with cats in our care.\nKids: In his previous home they noted he was friendly with kids. We have not seen him with kids yet in our care. \nIdeal home: Kinnick is a pretty laid back guy looking for a laid back home. He would prefer to not live in an elevator/high-rise situation, but he is adaptable to other living environments. \n\nKinnick is the sweetest senior guy! He is a chill dude who loves to play with his stuffed broccoli toy and lounge on the couch. He loves to follow his foster fam around the home and see what they are up to! He is happy to watch some TV with you or help you prepare a yummy dinner - just as long as he gets some snacks along the way! Kinnick lives with a ~70lb playful dog in his foster home and hasn't showed much interest in playing, but he is happy to co-exist with him. This sweet pup is so deserving of the most special forever home!\n\nKinnick's adoption fee is 150. He is neutered, up to date on core vaccines, microchipped and heartworm negative. He will be due for booster vaccines at the adopter's expense. He had an ear infection upon arrival and has been getting medication in foster care. Continued care would be the responsibility of the adopter. \n\n***We are receiving a much higher than usual number of adoption applications. We ask that you please be patient and someone will be in touch via email within 72 hours. Please do not email us unless you have not received a response in 72 hours.

Those emails will not be answered.\nAdoption fees for NY dogs is $800 as we are having to use a cargo flying company to bring in the dogs from China. $800 does actually not cover the whole cost. We are fundraising the rest. We don't know the exact breeds of the dogs, so we guess based on their appearance.\n\nMoon is a stray from China. she is 1 and a half years old and roughly 7 pounds.\nMoon was rescued on the West Road in Xipu Town, Pidu District, Chengdu City on the morning of August 27, 2020. She suffered from a serious skin disease and was tied up in a bush with a dog leash and abandoned by her owner. She is doing a lot better now. She is a playful, friendly and outgoing dog. She is so sweet. She gets along well with other dogs.\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out the form here:\n\nhttps://homeboundhoundz.com/application-form",

Those emails will not be answered.\nAdoption fees for NY dogs is $800 as we are having to use a cargo flying company to bring in the dogs from China. $800 does actually not cover the whole cost. We are fundraising the rest.\n\nI had a hard time choosing Bean's breeds for this listing. She is quite small, but she doesn't look like a typical small dog. She looks like a big dog but shrunken. She's basically a permanent puppy! Bean is from China.\nShe was abandoned as a puppy after the owner moved.  She is a little timid at first, but  after getting familiar with you, you will see that she is a gentle and sweet dog. She is Longing for you to love her. She gets along with other dogs.\nShe is about 1 and a half years old and 22 pounds.\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out the form here:\n\nhttps://homeboundhoundz.com/application-form",

She likes to chase a ball or toy, or play a short game of tug of war.  Ella enjoys a walk daily to explore trails; in a quiet, low-traffic area; or sniffing around in a fenced yard. She loves to snuggle in bed with her humans, and burrow under the covers.  Ella is just an all-around easy-to-please girl. She is shy but not needy, and is learning how to ask for attention. She is looking for a calmer adult family who won't rush her into their lives, but will allow her to unfold as she is comfortable and let mutual love/trust grow. \n\nElla is a quiet girl who prefers the company of adult humans (the noise and activity of kids is stressful for her) or maybe a cat; she is not comfortable around other dogs. Ella is house-trained and crate-trained; she can be at home alone for 6-8 hours while you work, and she does fine uncrated. She would be happiest with a family who has some larger dog and training experience. Ella can become overstimulated when outside, and is doing well working with a positive reinforcement-based trainer. Bark Bark Wag will provide several sessions with the trainer, to help Ella transition into her forever home. We're looking for a family who can continue with Ella's learning, to help her continue to blossom and be successful in her new home.\n",

Jasper was found on the streets of Gastonia, NC - thin and alone.  Jasper is shy at first but warms up quickly and get excited when you give him a ball or show him a leash to go for a walk.  Jasper was the shelter director's favorite. As she was leaving her position - her last wish was to get Jasper out.  Unfortunately, he is Heartworm positive so will need treatment which we will get sponsorship for.  If you would like to meet Jasper, please reach out to adoptsch@gmail.com  \n",

            "description": "Meet Zeek! This sweet boy is almost 2 years old and he REALLY knows how to work the puppy dog eyes! Zeke is a great mix of spunk and chill! He loves going for walks and playing with other dogs but he is also happy to sit with you for snuggles. Zeeks hind end sort of has a mind of its own, when he walks he is a bit wobbly! Zeek has been checked out by a neurologist who found no abnormalities on the MRI, they believe this is something he was born with. Lucky for Zeek he can live a pain free normal life without any extra medical care or maintenance! \n\nZeek is currently in foster care with a dog and cat and doing well! The cat has not come out of hiding yet but Zeek did not chase him or try to seek him out once he took off!\n\nZeek can go up and down stairs with little to no hesitation but for his safety would not do well in a living situation that required him to climb several stair cases. Carpeted stairs are easier (and safer) for him!\n\nZeek hopes his wobbles dont turn you away! Once you meet him you will fall in love!!\n\nApply at  http://caninehumane.org/adoption-application/\n\nAdoption Fee is $350\nHe is up to date on vaccines and has had a wellness exam, heartworm tested and micro-chipped.\n\n In order to meet any of our dogs, please fill out an application. To fill out an application \ngo to http://caninehumane.org/adoption-application/ \n\nIF THE DOG IS ON PETFINDER THEN IT IS STILL AVAILABLE\n\nwww.caninehumane.org \n\n***BE SURE TO CHECK YOUR SPAM/PROMOTION EMAIL FOLDER FOR CHN RESPONSE TO YOUR APPLICATION***",

Chuck is about 1 year old and only 16 lbs. He looks bigger, but he is mostly hair! He would've been great in an 80's rock band! Rock on little brother!\n\nChuck is good with other dogs and would probably be fine with cats if he was introduced slowly and appropriately. \n\nHe has a great personality! He is happy, friendly and full of affection. So far, Chuck has been quiet while crated and hasn't pottied inside the foster's home. He likes foster dad too, so no fear with men, YAY!\n\nChuck is playful and loves to go on walks. He pulls some, but is learning. He is just super excited to be out and about. Chuck would benefit from a basic obedience training class, but that's easy! We love K9 Manners and More in Broken Arrow, they are a great training outfit.\n\nEmail us about him today at amyh@rescuednready.com. He will make a great family pet. ADOPTIONS ONLY TO PEOPLE LIVING IN THE NORTHEASTERN OKLAHOMA AREA.  \n\nIf you are interested in this dog, please contact volunteer Amy at amyh@rescuednready.com or at 918-688-0755.\n\nThe adoption fee is $225.00 and includes all current vaccinations, negative heartworm test, worming, microchip, and spay/neuter surgery.  Go to www.rescuednready.com to learn about our adoption process and download our application.  \n\nCALL or EMAIL US TO MEET ONE OF OUR ADOPTABLE DOGS! Call Amy at 918-688-0755 or email at amyh@rescuednready.com.\n\nLIKE RESCUED 'N READY ON FACEBOOK!!",

We are fundraising the rest.\n\nThis is Fox. She is a stray from China.\n1 year old. 10 pounds. Particularly close to people (shy with strangers at first, but relaxes in time.)\nshe was hit by a car and as a result her leg was broken but it has since been cured and now she is healthy. Sometimes you might see her back leg lift a bit when she walks or runs but it is barely noticeable.\nLively personality, active, can get along with dogs friendly, just gets a bit nervous when meeting new people.\n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out the form here:\n\nhttps://homeboundhoundz.com/application-form",

PLEASE READ MY BIO BELOW TO LEARN MORE ABOUT ME AND HOW TO APPLY TO ADOPT :)\n\nMeet the F pups:: 8 weeks old on 2/3/21, 8 to 10 pounds, 4 males, 1 female, boxer/beagle/husky mixes.\n\nAccenting Applications, adoptions start on 2/6/21\n\nWe were asked to assist with these babies after their mother, a boxer beagle mix, got loose before she was spayed and ended up pregnant by the neighbor's husky. We are paying to spay the mother so this doesn't happen again, and we have inquired about neutering the father, but we're not sure the neighbor will cooperate. \n\nThe mother's owner only wanted what was best for the puppies, so she contacted us to surrender them. While we provided all of their deworming, vaccines and flea/heartworm prevention, she cared for them very well, loved them very much, and they are healthy and well socialized with people, other dogs and children. These puppies have had a wonderful start to life and are now ready to search for their forever homes. They will be medium sized active dogs when grown and will need an active family to keep them busy.\n\n$195 Adoption Fee. \n\nA $10.00 non-refundable application fee is required to submit your adoption application and will be deducted from your adoption fee if you adopt.\n\nAll puppies are dewormed, started on heartworm and flea prevention, and microchipped.\n\nAll puppies will be adopted with current, age appropriate vaccines, given by Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue. Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue will provide their puppy series DAPP vaccines, given at 8, 12, and 16 weeks of age.\n\nPuppy adopters will be will be required to bring the puppy back to Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue to receive any remaining puppy vaccines after adoption. \n\nPuppy adopters will also be required to bring the puppy to our vet for their spay/neuter surgery after they receive their 16 week vaccination. \n\nThe spay/neuter and puppy vaccines are included with the puppy adoption fee.\n\nWe have a strict one hour puppy adoption radius, puppy adopters must be within one hour of Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue. Please see our Adoption Radius tab on our website for more info, here:\nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/adoption-radius/\n\nAlong with other criteria evaluated in the adoption application, a Fenced Yard is required to adopt. \n\nPlease see our Fenced Yard Requirements tab on our website for more information, here:\nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/fenced-yard-requirements/\n\nTO CHECK AVAILABILITY of any of our adoptable animals, please go to our available pets tab, here: https://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/available-pets-for-adoption/\n\nAll pets listed here are updated regularly to reflect their availability.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR PEPPERMINT PIG ANIMAL RESCUE:\n\nBefore completing the application, please read our ADOPTION PROCESS tab on our website, here: \nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/how-our-adoptions-work/\n\nTo complete our easy online adoption application, please visit our website at PeppermintPigAnimalRescue.org.\n\nAdoption events are held every Saturday in our thrift store from 1:00pm to 4:00pm. Please complete your adoption application in advance so our volunteers have time to screen and contact potential adopters.\n\nIMPORTANT: All applications are reviewed in the order they are received and qualifications are based on best fit for each individual pet.

I am up to date on shots and microchipped, but I am not neutered.\nI am very friendly to humans and I don\u2019t mind other dogs. I haven\u2019t been around kids, but I am very sweet... I think I would like them! I like to be pet and relax around the house. I do not bark, chew on anything, and I am potty trained. I don\u2019t mind my crate, but I\u2019d rather be in a dog bed. I am very motivated by food which makes me easier to train.\nMy adoption fees is $300 plus a $100 refundable deposit after proof of neuter.\nI would make a great addition to your Family! If you think we would make a good match you can apply to adopt me at the following site. Ask for Joe!\nwww.lastpawrescue.org\n\n501 (c) approved WI agricultural license 285589 DS",

PLEASE READ MY BIO BELOW TO LEARN MORE ABOUT ME AND HOW TO APPLY TO ADOPT :)\n\nMeet the F pups:: 8 weeks old on 2/3/21, 8 to 10 pounds, 4 males, 1 female, boxer/beagle/husky mixes.\n\nAccenting Applications, adoptions start on 2/6/21\n\nWe were asked to assist with these babies after their mother, a boxer beagle mix, got loose before she was spayed and ended up pregnant by the neighbor's husky. We are paying to spay the mother so this doesn't happen again, and we have inquired about neutering the father, but we're not sure the neighbor will cooperate. \n\nThe mother's owner only wanted what was best for the puppies, so she contacted us to surrender them. While we provided all of their deworming, vaccines and flea/heartworm prevention, she cared for them very well, loved them very much, and they are healthy and well socialized with people, other dogs and children. These puppies have had a wonderful start to life and are now ready to search for their forever homes. They will be medium sized active dogs when grown and will need an active family to keep them busy.\n\n$195 Adoption Fee. \n\nA $10.00 non-refundable application fee is required to submit your adoption application and will be deducted from your adoption fee if you adopt.\n\nAll puppies are dewormed, started on heartworm and flea prevention, and microchipped.\n\nAll puppies will be adopted with current, age appropriate vaccines, given by Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue. Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue will provide their puppy series DAPP vaccines, given at 8, 12, and 16 weeks of age.\n\nPuppy adopters will be will be required to bring the puppy back to Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue to receive any remaining puppy vaccines after adoption. \n\nPuppy adopters will also be required to bring the puppy to our vet for their spay/neuter surgery after they receive their 16 week vaccination. \n\nThe spay/neuter and puppy vaccines are included with the puppy adoption fee.\n\nWe have a strict one hour puppy adoption radius, puppy adopters must be within one hour of Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue. Please see our Adoption Radius tab on our website for more info, here:\nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/adoption-radius/\n\nAlong with other criteria evaluated in the adoption application, a Fenced Yard is required to adopt. \n\nPlease see our Fenced Yard Requirements tab on our website for more information, here:\nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/fenced-yard-requirements/\n\nTO CHECK AVAILABILITY of any of our adoptable animals, please go to our available pets tab, here: https://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/available-pets-for-adoption/\n\nAll pets listed here are updated regularly to reflect their availability.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR PEPPERMINT PIG ANIMAL RESCUE:\n\nBefore completing the application, please read our ADOPTION PROCESS tab on our website, here: \nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/how-our-adoptions-work/\n\nTo complete our easy online adoption application, please visit our website at PeppermintPigAnimalRescue.org.\n\nAdoption events are held every Saturday in our thrift store from 1:00pm to 4:00pm.

She is incredibly smart, treat motivated, can sit, lay down and patiently waits for her food. She needs an EXPERIENCED firm kind hand.\nShe loves nothing more than running and playing fetch in the yard. A big fully fenced in yard is a MUST to burn her energy as she is not fond of passing unknown dogs on a walk and is leash reactive. Ideally Macy should be an ONLY dog. NO small children (14+) as she has she gets very excited and jumps on her humans. She would like someone who can be home with her most of the time.\nAt the end of the day, Macy would love nothing more than to settle down and cuddle with her family.\nIf you'd like to make this playful energetic girl part of your family, please send an email to jerseygirlsanimalrescue@gmail.com for an application. \n\nAdoption fee $300",

We are paying to spay the mother so this doesn't happen again, and we have inquired about neutering the father, but we're not sure the neighbor will cooperate. \n\nThe mother's owner only wanted what was best for the puppies, so she contacted us to surrender them. While we provided all of their deworming, vaccines and flea/heartworm prevention, she cared for them very well, loved them very much, and they are healthy and well socialized with people, other dogs and children. These puppies have had a wonderful start to life and are now ready to search for their forever homes. They will be medium sized active dogs when grown and will need an active family to keep them busy.\n\n$195 Adoption Fee. \n\nA $10.00 non-refundable application fee is required to submit your adoption application and will be deducted from your adoption fee if you adopt.\n\nAll puppies are dewormed, started on heartworm and flea prevention, and microchipped.\n\nAll puppies will be adopted with current, age appropriate vaccines, given by Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue. Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue will provide their puppy series DAPP vaccines, given at 8, 12, and 16 weeks of age.\n\nPuppy adopters will be will be required to bring the puppy back to Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue to receive any remaining puppy vaccines after adoption. \n\nPuppy adopters will also be required to bring the puppy to our vet for their spay/neuter surgery after they receive their 16 week vaccination. \n\nThe spay/neuter and puppy vaccines are included with the puppy adoption fee.\n\nWe have a strict one hour puppy adoption radius, puppy adopters must be within one hour of Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue. Please see our Adoption Radius tab on our website for more info, here:\nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/adoption-radius/\n\nAlong with other criteria evaluated in the adoption application, a Fenced Yard is required to adopt. \n\nPlease see our Fenced Yard Requirements tab on our website for more information, here:\nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/fenced-yard-requirements/\n\nTO CHECK AVAILABILITY of any of our adoptable animals, please go to our available pets tab, here: https://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/available-pets-for-adoption/\n\nAll pets listed here are updated regularly to reflect their availability.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR PEPPERMINT PIG ANIMAL RESCUE:\n\nBefore completing the application, please read our ADOPTION PROCESS tab on our website, here: \nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/how-our-adoptions-work/\n\nTo complete our easy online adoption application, please visit our website at PeppermintPigAnimalRescue.org.\n\nAdoption events are held every Saturday in our thrift store from 1:00pm to 4:00pm. Please complete your adoption application in advance so our volunteers have time to screen and contact potential adopters.\n\nIMPORTANT: All applications are reviewed in the order they are received and qualifications are based on best fit for each individual pet.

This pretty little girl is currently 6.5 weeks old. She will available for adoption on Feb 10, once she is 8 weeks old.\n\nShe is cuddly and sweet, and loves to be with her person, but has so much personality already!\n\nMom is a yellow lab, and dad is a lab mix of some kind. These pups came to us as a surrendered litter. The family could no longer care for them, and they needed help, so they contacted us.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out our application first! You are unlikely to get an email response if you have not submitted an application. Our application can be found on our PetFinder homepage, or on our Facebook page as the top pinned post!\n\nDue to COVID restrictions, we will not be doing meet/greets prior to adoption day. If your application is approved, you will be asked to pay your adoption fee up front, within 24 hours of receiving your invoice. This places the puppy on hold for you. If you decide not to adopt after meeting your puppy, your fee will be refunded immediately. If you do not show up at the scheduled time without prior notice, you will forfeit any paid fees.\n\nThank you for reading about this sweet girl, and we look forward to meeting her new family!",

All day long, you'll have good luck\" well, we'd like to extend that to our little Chihuahua mix here, except you'll be gaining a lifetime's worth of luck! Penny is about 4 years old and weighing just 14 lbs she'll happily be picked up into your arms. She has gorgeous two-colored eyes and a blonde coat that's even prettier. Penny is still carving out her spot on the farm, but she truly doesn't hope to be here long as the hubbub is all a bit much for her. She'd love to find a quiet adult household where she can live happily snuggled up in the lap of some special person. This Lucky Penny is waiting for you to pick her up, so get in your adoption request right away!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

She loves people and is eager to please. She knows \"sit\" and walks nicely on lead. Like most dogs, she guards the house and yard against other canine \"intruders\", but she walks nicely side-by-side with other dogs. Since she is so people-oriented, we think she would love being the dog in a home where she will get lots of attention.\n\nWasabi's adoption fee is $80. She is spayed and up to date on shots.\n\nHPHS supports spay/neutering of all pets. Adopt from us and your new pet is spayed or neutered. They are up to date with their shots as well.\n\nDiscount spay/neuter vouchers are also available at the Second Chance Thrift Store. Income verification is necessary tp receive the voucher.",

We are paying to spay the mother so this doesn't happen again, and we have inquired about neutering the father, but we're not sure the neighbor will cooperate. \n\nThe mother's owner only wanted what was best for the puppies, so she contacted us to surrender them. While we provided all of their deworming, vaccines and flea/heartworm prevention, she cared for them very well, loved them very much, and they are healthy and well socialized with people, other dogs and children. These puppies have had a wonderful start to life and are now ready to search for their forever homes. They will be medium sized active dogs when grown and will need an active family to keep them busy.\n\n$195 Adoption Fee. \n\nA $10.00 non-refundable application fee is required to submit your adoption application and will be deducted from your adoption fee if you adopt.\n\nAll puppies are dewormed, started on heartworm and flea prevention, and microchipped.\n\nAll puppies will be adopted with current, age appropriate vaccines, given by Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue. Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue will provide their puppy series DAPP vaccines, given at 8, 12, and 16 weeks of age.\n\nPuppy adopters will be will be required to bring the puppy back to Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue to receive any remaining puppy vaccines after adoption. \n\nPuppy adopters will also be required to bring the puppy to our vet for their spay/neuter surgery after they receive their 16 week vaccination. \n\nThe spay/neuter and puppy vaccines are included with the puppy adoption fee.\n\nWe have a strict one hour puppy adoption radius, puppy adopters must be within one hour of Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue. Please see our Adoption Radius tab on our website for more info, here:\nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/adoption-radius/\n\nAlong with other criteria evaluated in the adoption application, a Fenced Yard is required to adopt. \n\nPlease see our Fenced Yard Requirements tab on our website for more information, here:\nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/fenced-yard-requirements/\n\nTO CHECK AVAILABILITY of any of our adoptable animals, please go to our available pets tab, here: https://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/available-pets-for-adoption/\n\nAll pets listed here are updated regularly to reflect their availability.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR PEPPERMINT PIG ANIMAL RESCUE:\n\nBefore completing the application, please read our ADOPTION PROCESS tab on our website, here: \nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/how-our-adoptions-work/\n\nTo complete our easy online adoption application, please visit our website at PeppermintPigAnimalRescue.org.\n\nAdoption events are held every Saturday in our thrift store from 1:00pm to 4:00pm.

PLEASE READ MY BIO BELOW TO LEARN MORE ABOUT ME AND HOW TO APPLY TO ADOPT :)\n\nMeet the F pups:: 8 weeks old on 2/3/21, 8 to 10 pounds, 4 males, 1 female, boxer/beagle/husky mixes.\n\nAccenting Applications, adoptions start on 2/6/21\n\nWe were asked to assist with these babies after their mother, a boxer beagle mix, got loose before she was spayed and ended up pregnant by the neighbor's husky. We are paying to spay the mother so this doesn't happen again, and we have inquired about neutering the father, but we're not sure the neighbor will cooperate. \n\nThe mother's owner only wanted what was best for the puppies, so she contacted us to surrender them. While we provided all of their deworming, vaccines and flea/heartworm prevention, she cared for them very well, loved them very much, and they are healthy and well socialized with people, other dogs and children. These puppies have had a wonderful start to life and are now ready to search for their forever homes. They will be medium sized active dogs when grown and will need an active family to keep them busy.\n\n$195 Adoption Fee. \n\nA $10.00 non-refundable application fee is required to submit your adoption application and will be deducted from your adoption fee if you adopt.\n\nAll puppies are dewormed, started on heartworm and flea prevention, and microchipped.\n\nAll puppies will be adopted with current, age appropriate vaccines, given by Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue. Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue will provide their puppy series DAPP vaccines, given at 8, 12, and 16 weeks of age.\n\nPuppy adopters will be will be required to bring the puppy back to Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue to receive any remaining puppy vaccines after adoption. \n\nPuppy adopters will also be required to bring the puppy to our vet for their spay/neuter surgery after they receive their 16 week vaccination. \n\nThe spay/neuter and puppy vaccines are included with the puppy adoption fee.\n\nWe have a strict one hour puppy adoption radius, puppy adopters must be within one hour of Peppermint Pig Animal Rescue. Please see our Adoption Radius tab on our website for more info, here:\nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/adoption-radius/\n\nAlong with other criteria evaluated in the adoption application, a Fenced Yard is required to adopt. \n\nPlease see our Fenced Yard Requirements tab on our website for more information, here:\nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/fenced-yard-requirements/\n\nTO CHECK AVAILABILITY of any of our adoptable animals, please go to our available pets tab, here: https://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/available-pets-for-adoption/\n\nAll pets listed here are updated regularly to reflect their availability.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR PEPPERMINT PIG ANIMAL RESCUE:\n\nBefore completing the application, please read our ADOPTION PROCESS tab on our website, here: \nhttps://peppermintpiganimalrescue.org/how-our-adoptions-work/\n\nTo complete our easy online adoption application, please visit our website at PeppermintPigAnimalRescue.org.\n\nAdoption events are held every Saturday in our thrift store from 1:00pm to 4:00pm. Please complete your adoption application in advance so our volunteers have time to screen and contact potential adopters.\n\nIMPORTANT: All applications are reviewed in the order they are received and qualifications are based on best fit for each individual pet.

A home with other dogs is required as it allows Toto to navigate his world with a bit more confidence. Young kids are not recommended to live with Toto due to his shy nature. JNG",

This spunky little girl is currently 6.5 weeks old. She will available for adoption on Feb 10, once she is 8 weeks old.\n\nShe is cuddly and sweet, and loves to be with her person, but has so much personality already!\n\nMom is a yellow lab, and dad is a lab mix of some kind. These pups came to us as a surrendered litter. The family could no longer care for them, and they needed help, so they contacted us.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out our application first! You are unlikely to get an email response if you have not submitted an application. Our application can be found on our PetFinder homepage, or on our Facebook page as the top pinned post!\n\nDue to COVID restrictions, we will not be doing meet/greets prior to adoption day. If your application is approved, you will be asked to pay your adoption fee up front, within 24 hours of receiving your invoice. This places the puppy on hold for you. If you decide not to adopt after meeting your puppy, your fee will be refunded immediately. If you do not show up at the scheduled time without prior notice, you will forfeit any paid fees.\n\nThank you for reading about this sweet girl, and we look forward to meeting her new family!",

She was dumped and abandoned and luckily someone was kind enough to notify the shelter in Arkansas who went and picked her up. She came to Illinois in search of her forever home.  Freeia is the most well behaved puppy, she is sweet, playful and well mannered. She is crate trained, 95% potty trained,(as long as someone is consistent with the needs of a puppy and she goes out often) does very well with children, other dogs, but she has now NOT done well with the families cat. We are at this time saying NO CATS. She is very affectionate, loves attention and being petted and snuggling are her favorites. She is learning basic puppy manners, and is a fast learner. She is so smart. She will make an excellent addition to any family. If interested please fill out an application on our website www.foreverhomedogrescueil.org\n\nWE DO NOT DO OUT OF STATE ADOPTIONS\nThank you for considering the adoption of one of our rescue dogs.  We are committed to finding our rescues the perfect home. Together we can make a difference in the life of a dog.\n \nThe adoption process should be a fun and exciting time for families and dogs. Our goal is to place our babies in forever homes.  The potential adopter needs to be dedicated to their care and training for life. \nUnderstand that sharing your life with a dog can be a commitment of 15+ years. This would include feeding, exercise, training, vetting, and providing a loving home. Ask yourself, \"Am I ready for this type of commitment?\"  If you are ready, we are here to help.  We do have some requirements to help us find the perfect placement of our babies. \n\nWE ARE A FOSTER BASED RESCUE ONLY. WE DO NOT HAVE A PHYSICAL BUILDING\n1.  Apply online at https://www.foreverhomedogrescueil.org\nWe must have an application, conduct a phone interview, and meet your entire family (including other dogs) to approve an adoption. Only a final approval for adoption can take place after a successful meet and greet. This is done by appointments only. We will not proceed with the adoption if everyone has not met the dog.  This will allow others the opportunity to adopt the dog.\n2.  Adopters MUST be 21 years old.\nInformation on all adults/members living in the home is required\nWe REQUIRE you to provide proof and vet reference that all current and past pets have been kept up to date on all routine medical.\n3.  Illinois law requires that all of our dogs and puppies be spayed/neutered within 30 days of adoption. In order to fully comply with this regulation and reduce the number of homeless dogs and puppies, \n4.  If you do not own your home, you must provide landlord contact information on the application and a copy of your lease that outlines the rules for dog ownership in your residence.  \nLarge breed dogs will not be adopted into apartment settings or where there are breed/ size restrictions.\nPuppies have special needs and require a home where someone is available to care for, socialize, and give basic training.  If you are gone for more than a couple hours at a time, please consider adopting a teen or older dog.\n5.  Adoption fees are $350. We accept checks or cash. (Prices are subject to change without notice).\n6.  All dogs and puppies adopted through Forever Home are fully vetted with age appropriate vaccines. Keep in mind once you take possession of your newly adopted dog, any and all future medical costs or care is YOUR responsibility.\n7. First time puppy/dog adopters will be required to sign up for and pay in advance a basic training class. A deposit of an extra 50.00 will be required until a class has been completed, it will then be returned. \n8. WE DO NOT DO OUT OF STATE ADOPTIONS \n \nMedical included is as follows:\nSpay/Neuter (age appropriate) *Forever Home uses Fox Valley Animal Welfare League in Aurora, IL\nAge appropriate core vaccines\nFecal testing and deworming\nFlea and tick preventative\nFree 1st Vet visit at one of our participating vets\nMicrochipping\n \nForever Home Dog Rescue reserves the right to deny any applicant.",

She is a sweet adult lab/terrier mix with an adorable scruffy coat about 3 years old and 50 lbs. She is the friendliest girl who loves giving hugs and taking any opportunity for snuggles from volunteers. She gets along great with other dogs, but having one in her forever home certainly isn't a requirement. Rhona is easy going, but still likes to have a good time! She is a total love who will be so much joy to the home that makes her part of it. Rhona can't wait to meet you and we hope you love her just as much as we do!\n\nPlease note we are working with limited staff/volunteers at this time. For full details of our current adoption appointment policy, please see https://savinggracenc.org/adoption-appointments-during-this-time/. Highlights:\n\nWe are working with a very limited staff/volunteer base\n\nWe do not have the people power to respond to emails/call about specific dogs\n\nOur appointments are limited to 2 people at a time and for a maximum of 30 minutes.\n\nPlease arrive at your appointment ready to meet the dogs we have available. At this time, many dogs are in foster families or not yet posted on our website. Be flexible and ready to meet any number of wonderful dogs available onsite at the time of your appointment.\n\nAll puppies and dogs at Saving Grace are crate trained, have been spayed/neutered, are up to date on their vaccinations, are on heartworm preventative and have been microchipped. Their adoption fee is $375.00. Each has been carefully screened for disposition and temperament in order to provide your home with a safe companion that will enjoy life as your new family member.\n\nOur Adoption Form can be completed online at our website at https://savinggracenc.org/how-to-adopt/ .\n\nAn Adoption Form is required before setting up an appointment to meet with a potential adoptee or a foster home.\n\nSending an Adoption Form does not commit you to an adoption, it simply provides us with background information on potential homes.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help cover the cost of care for these wonderful dogs awaiting new homes, please visit the donate page on our website at https://savinggracenc.org/donate-now/ .\n\nSaving Grace is a small, non-profit 501-C3 organization operated by volunteers only. Most of our animals come from rural animal control shelters where lack of space and resources limit their time and adoption possibilities. Thank you for choosing Saving Grace! We look forward to helping you find your new companion and family member.",

Those emails will not be answered.\nAdoption fees for NY dogs is $800 as we are having to use a cargo flying company to bring in the dogs from China. $800 does actually not cover the whole cost. We are fundraising the rest.\nWe do not know any of the dogs' exact breeds. The listed breeds are just guesses based on how they (or their parents, if known) look.\n\nThis is Pheonix. He is a stray from China.\n1.5 years old. 8 pounds.\n About Pheonix:\nLively, good with people and other dogs, cheerful and sensible\n\nStory: I was born with half of my nose missing. But because of my fluffy hair, you can't really see. And regardless, it makes me so much cuter!~ Fortunately, I am a puppy and don\u2019t care about it. I was born a happy puppy. By the way, I am still very healthy and handsome. . I don\u2019t remember my previous life anymore. My memory starts when I appeared on the street. For stray dogs, avoiding traffic that can be fatal at any time is nothing. Sometimes... I was bullied by a group of \"curious\" children in the community the day I met the volunteers. , Very dirty, I did not expect the volunteer sister to take me to the foster care base~ Although my life is very safe now, I still maintain a happy nature.\n personality: cheerful, sensible, sweet. Good with other dogs and people.\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out the form here:\n\nhttps://homeboundhoundz.com/application-form",

He currently weighs about 15 lbs and we don't think he will get too big but, that is also a guess.\n\nChubb was found outside as a stray in rural Kentucky. He was underweight and loaded with worms. He is still getting some weight on him but, has been treated for worms and now tested clear.\n\nHe is a shy puppy but, opens up quick. In his foster home he lives with 3 big pitbulls and a couple cats. He loves to play with his pittie buddies and to chase the cats! He is working on potty training but, is not perfect. His foster mom says he poops outside only by the treeline because he likes to \"hide\" when he poops. Privacy? He's also leaning the leash.\n\nWe are requiring a fenced yard for Chubb because he spooks easily and feel a fence is safer for him. He would do best in a home with another dog. He likes toys and isn't a big barker so far. \n\nChubb is neutered, vaccinated, dewormed, microchipped and on monthly flea/tick and heartworm prevention.\n\n\n\nAdoption Fee: $300\n\n***We require a complete and approved application before setting up a meet n greet.***\n\nTo apply to adopt just copy and paste the link into your search bar!\nhttps://fs24.formsite.com/oneatatimek9rescue/form1/index.html",

            "description": "If you're looking for the happiest and most social pup you've ever met, look no further! Meet Cody! He was adopted 6 years ago and returned to us at no fault of his own. His previous people said he had some skin allergies, so we took him to the vet and he got allergy testing , a cytopoint injection that he needs only on an as needed basis, along with a limited ingredient dog food that he LOVEs! Cody is getting allergy drops daily for immunotherapy with environmental allergies that is already covered and will only need for 9-12 months when his immune system is built up. His skin and fur look AMAZING and he is just like any other pup. His foster mom thinks his past possible skin issues with his previous adopters is a non-issue since she hasn't seen him having any problems now that he is on the limited ingredient food.\n\nCody is the definition of a wiggle butt and little shadow. He follows his people EVERYWHERE and constantly is wagging his tail. He loves to sleep next to his peeps in the bed but will also be fine in a dog bed on the floor. He is completely house and crate trained. He loves his foster siblings and the puppies in the house as well. They all constantly play, but he loves people way more. Cody is great around kids too! He definitely craves attention and wants to be where you are, so be prepared for all the Cody kisses and snuggles! Cody would do best in a home with someone that is home more often than not and give lots of attention as just because he is 7 he still has quite a bit of energy. A family with kids would be amazing so the kids can keep him busy and play with him! Cody is the easiest and sweetest guy that anyone that adopts him will hit the jackpot!!\n\nCody is a Male Bichon / Schnauzer Mix that we estimate to be around 7 years old and weighs 23 lbs.",

            "description": "\"Can you imagine losing your sight? How about losing everyone and everything you were ever familiar with? How about both at once? How about being blind and moving to new places with new people over and over again? I'm Grace, and that's my story. My newest foster parents say they are determined to help me change that. I am an 8-year-old, medium size, boxer mix with so much love and so many snuggles to give out. I navigate my world through sound, smell, and very cautious feeling. I am the definition of sweetness with all people, just please talk to me so I know who and where you are. I need a special family who will give me TIME and PATIENCE to learn about my new home and our new routine as a family. However, I'll be down for cuddles, kisses, and tail wags day one. Since I can't see them coming, other dogs getting too close to me is very scary. I would do best in a home as the center of your world, but a cat who will keep their distance would be fine. Foster mom and dad are helping me settle here and figuring out what works for me, they can tell you anything they learn and will help in any way they can! I come with an extra support system now. Here's what I've told them so far: I don't like to be kenneled. It's scary, I hit a wall everywhere I turn. I understand potty training and can be very successful with it with a routine. I don't like to be alone, it's frightening in a new place. Music and TV helps me though. My favorite shows are Sofia the First and Curious George, I will tell you if Netflix stops playing! I will continue to learn to grow my independence and confidence while I'm here. Sleep and snuggles are my most favorite pastimes, let's work those in often! I walk GREAT on a leash, which is awesome not only for exercise and potty time, but for helping me learn to navigate my new spaces safely! So, do you think I'm worth it? Could you offer me the forever I've been hoping for? I promise to love you so, so much in return. Please reach out to foster momma with questions. I'm begging, let's make this next move my last move.\n\nAll my love and dreams, \nGrace",

I take her to doggy care with lots of dogs and that helps her burn her energy, and we take long walks too. She is not crate trained; however, she is okay staying in her crate as long as the door is open. She gets very anxious when crated and easily escape out of it.\n\nIt took me 2 days to show her where to potty. She understands some commands like \"good girl\" and \"sit,\" and we are currently working on \"wait\" and \"go.\" She still needs a little help to walk on leash. \n\nApply to meet her today!",

Those emails will not be answered.\nAdoption fees for NY dogs is $800 as we are having to use a cargo flying company to bring in the dogs from China. $800 does actually not cover the whole cost. We are fundraising the rest.\nWe do not know any of the dogs' exact breeds. The listed breeds are just guesses based on how they (or their parents, if known) look.\n\nThis is Peanut. He is a stray from China.\n2.5 years old. 25 pounds.\n About Peanut:\n\nI was born in a corner of Lilac Lake Garden. This place was originally a rural area. Since the introduction of high-end housing, many people have moved out of this place, but they have left their dogs. It is not uncommon to see a stray dog ??here, but my mother, this extraordinary dog, saved us all. After the five of us were born in the grass, my mother has been rubbing her butt because of a bacterial infection. The volunteer sister was very moved when she saw her returning to the grass with her bleeding butt to breastfeed us and brought our family back to the base. After a while, my mother and little sister were adopted by well-wishers. My third brother went to the United States. The third brother often sent us photos of him riding a yacht and running on a huge lawn. I am very happy to see these. In my dream, I saw that I also have a home.\nI am 70cm in length, 50cm in height.\nI am very healthy. I am friendly with all dogs and people.\nI am a very loyal companion dog. I am well behaved, outgoing and confident.\n \n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out the form here:\n\nhttps://homeboundhoundz.com/application-form",

            "description": "Beautiful Willow is being fostered in NJ. She is in need of a confident owner. Please read Willow's bio below:\n\nMiss Wiggly Willow is a typical puppy for her breed. She doesn't let her sight impairment slow her down at all! She's happy, crazy, wiggly cheerful, and loves to play and have adventures. She's a little nervous around new people, but gets over it quickly with some yummy treats. Very food motivated and super smart. Crates like a dream! Excellently potty trained. Still working on not jumping up on humans, she gets so excited that she forgets. Zero issues with cats. Is very doggy language savvy, a simple quiet growl from another dog and she backs off. She LOVES water! Will happily shower with you every single day. Hasn't jumped up on the counters at all, not even for the cat food. \n\nShe needs a strong human leader though. Someone who will set clear and strict rules. She's smart enough to follow them. Rules make her feel more secure in her life. Willow is still a puppy, she will try getting away with things. Like treat stealing and guarding. A firm, loud, serious correction knocks all thoughts of guarding out of her little brain. She's also familiar with the squirt bottle.  She sometimes forgets not to pull on the leash, but she's getting better at that too. Puppy brains have a hard time concentrating sometimes. Overall she's a very good puppy and wants to be a good girl. She just needs to find the right pet parent(s).\nBDRA has voted against the use of electrical fencing effective immediately.",

            "description": "In the words of Muhammad Ali, we're not the greatest; we're the double greatest. Not only do we knock out for our naps but we pick the spot or something like that, right? Rocky and Diamond are an inseparable pair. They love to do everything together and are like two peas in a pod!\n\nDiamond is a mothering type to Rocky, and Rocky is there to keep Diamond calm in unfamiliar places and situations. Diamond is an outgoing, playful dog that loves to cuddle.  She doesn\u2019t like to be left out, so you\u2019ll always find her close by checking out what you\u2019re up to. Diamond loves to play and fetches her toys, but like her brother, also enjoys a nice nap on the couch. She also loves to show off to Rocky by catching her treats mid-air.  Being the mothering type, she\u2019s a bit protective of her brother and humans. She is also a bit hesitant to meet new people, but after a few treats she warms up quickly.\n\nRocky is a laid-back dog that seems to enjoy carrying his toys around more than playing with them.  Although whenever Diamond asks him to play, he\u2019s up for a game of tug of war or a chase around the yard. Just like his sister, he loves to cuddle. When it's time for a walk, his tail turns into a helicopter, spinning in excitement. During mealtime, he gets a bit protective of his food, so it is best to let him eat separately from Diamond. Based on both Diamond and Rocky\u2019s demeanor, they would be best fit in a home with no small children or other pets.  They love to run and play in the yard, so a larger yard where they can play fetch and tag would be ideal.  They aren't used to being crated and would need to be able to roam freely when left unattended.\n\nThe adoption donation for both Rocky & Adrian is $300.\n\nThis donation helps to cover veterinary expenses including spay/neuter, microchip and vaccinations. Wish Upon a Rescue is a 501(c)3 non-profit, foster based animal rescue. If you would like to meet Karma and Twinkie, please complete our adoption questionnaire at www.wishuponarescue.org/adopt. We will review your responses and be in contact to schedule a meet and greet at a time and place convenient for your family and our team members.",

            "description": "IN VERMONT\n\nMeet Layla! More pictures and video to come!\n\nLayla is 4 years old (approx. DOB 1-1-17), female, 55 lbs., vetted, is or will be spayed, and micro-chipped. In her current environment Layla is good with other dogs, is crate trained, potty trained, and does exhibit a prey drive toward yard animals so best if she is not with cats. She has medium+ energy, knows Sit, Come, Heel, Wait, Lay Down, Gentle, Off, Leave It, No, and Backup! Layla does alert you when there is people outside and gets very excitable; her best home would be active, experienced, and not have too much stimuli out the windows. Layla is in a home with another dog but might enjoy being the center of attention to build her security!\n\n\"Layla wants nothing more than to love you and snuggle you. I have no need for a weighted blanket because I often have her laying on me to snuggle. She is the comedian in the house and has such a big, goofy personality. Her little feet like to dance, she snorts like a pig, and she loves to smoosh her face on yours. When she's sleeping, she sleeps HARD and resembles a ragdoll. She's a giant bed hog and prefers to lay on a people between her people. Layla is a smart one but likes to play stupid until there's something delicious involved. Layla can be difficult and unmannered at times but has a heart of gold and will give unending laughter and love. Layla would do well with another dog that is submissive and similar in size. She would do best with someone who can take her outside to play whether that be in a back yard or out on a trail. As much as she loves people and wants to be by your side, she is fine to be left home while her people are at work. She'd prefer to be left uncrated but will tolerate a crate if needed. Kids would likely be okay as long as they're older, her butt wiggles and long tail can be deadly. She's very much a dog that needs a couch to lay on.\"\n\nIf you are interested in fostering or adopting Layla please fill out an Application at\n\nwww.Passion-4-Paws.org\n\n(please make sure you have the Vermont site not CT) - thanks!\n\nPlease note Fosters have 1st option of Adoption.\n\nCheck out her Facebook page (please \"Like\" us while you are there)!\n\nDisclosure:\n\nBreed labels are often incorrect: we rarely know the genetic lineage of the dogs we rescue. Many shelters and rescues specify breeds based on appearance; however, research has shown that less than 2% of a dog's DNA determines appearance!\n\nPassion 4 Paws does not practice the use of labels pertaining to compatibility with others or dog breed. Labels such as \"dog friendly\" and \"child friendly\" should be used with caution as they often over-simplify the personalities and behavior of dogs.",

He loves sleeping in bed, getting belly rubs, has a big personality and comes running when he smells meat, peanut butter and bananas. Chewy experiences some separation anxiety when his person isn't home.  Chewy would do well with someone who is home most of the time, someone who is retired or with other pups with a doggie door! He could use some leash training, but he is very treat motivated for training.  Chewy is very healthy, eats a good diet, healthy weight, gets teeth cleaned every year, shots up to date.  He goes to daycare often and does well with other dogs.\n",

You have to be pretty special to share your name with an iconic duo from a popular television shows, and these sweet dogs truly are!\n\nWhat's better than 1 great dog? Two great dogs, of course! Meet 3 year old Mary Ann and 18 month old Ginger! They are a bonded pair so we would first like  to find them an inside home together. Anywhere Mary Ann goes, Ginger is sure to follow. They both have gentle temperaments, with medium energy levels and are sweet, and easy on the leash.  Mary Ann is heartworm positive so she will need treatment in the near future which CCAC will pay for. (It is important for us to have her in a calm environment outside the shelter for her to begin.)  Someone would hopefully come see them and fall in love with them like we have, and then take them both home. Ginger could be adopted outright, and MaryAnn could be fostered with the intent to adopt, pending successful CCAC-funded treatment for heartworm.\n\nE-mail animalcontrol@cheathamcountytn.gov for more information!\n\nPlease come visit! We are open seven days a week from 9:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.\n\nAll animals posted are/will be available to the public after spay/neuter.\n\nWe are unable to place a hold on any animal unless adopter turns in pre-adoption and adoption forms and pays the adoption fee.\n\nOnly pre-authorized rescues may pull an animal prior to spay/neuter.\n",

We were rescuing another dog from a tiny shelter in Corona, and mom Astra (last photo), was impounded and was only available for rescue. We snatched her up.  The puppies are adorable fluff balls. As beautiful as Huskies are, it takes a certain lifestyle to own one responsibly. If you are not Husky savvy, please do your research before applying. Astra weighs 44 pounds. We have no idea who dad is.   All dogs in our program are current on all their shots and micro chipped.  Also included is one FREE one on one session with our amazing trainer at his facility in Van Nuys! It is not to be missed. We do not place dogs on a first come first serve basis, but rather to the home best suited for them. An adoption fee, application, and contract are required. All our dogs can be met with an approved application.  We do not place dogs on a first come first serve basis, but rather to the home best suited for them. Thank you for looking at a rescue dog for your next family member! Please direct all questions to shopbnb@gmail.com.",

She went right up to a home and asked if she could stay.  Unfortunately there were too many dogs at that home already, but luckily Shelby got hooked up with a rescue, and we just know we will find her the perfect forever home.\n\nShelby loves to run, and she loves to play with other dogs.  Given her background of free roaming on her own, she still needs to learn how to walk nicely on a leash, but will learn with time.  Shelby is known to lean in for love and attention, but doesn't need to be attached to her human at all times.  She's a happy, friendly girl, who is looking forward to learning the luxuries of a loving home - like how fun squeaky toys can be!\n\nIf you would like to be considered to adopt Shelby, please complete the adoption application for Shelby online here:\n\nhttp://www.doubledogrescuevolunteers.org/adoption_application.php?dog=Shelby\n\n(please reach out to KateS@doubledogrescue.org if you run into any issues with the application process).\n",

            "description": "Ralphie came to us from IACS as a stray. He was listed as urgent because he was very fearful and under-socialized and not adoptable in his current state. We networked hard for this guy and his amazing foster family stepped up for him. He has been settling in and loving life. He\u2019s now ready to find a home of his own! \n\nHere is what his foster family has to say about him. \n\nRalphie has come such a long way! He came to us very timid and fearful. Now, he is full of energy and very affectionate! Ralphie doesn\u2019t know his own size or strength, so it would probably be best if he wasn\u2019t in a home with small children under 5, in case he were to knock them over or climb on them. We have been working on potty training, and he has been doing well! But he will continue to need some ongoing work. Ralphie loooooves other pups! So he should definitely be in a home with other dogs. Just watch out - he loves to play and wrestle! He should also be in a home with a fenced yard, so he can run until his heart\u2019s content and burn off all his energy! We have been crate training him when we leave the house, because he gets very anxious when his \u2018people\u2019 leave. If you are looking for a loyal, affectionate, playful dog - Ralphie is your guy!!!!\n\nRalphie is a family dog and still has some stranger danger. He is still working on proper introductions and learning that new people aren\u2019t scary. Slow intros are best for him! Ralphie is enrolled in a dog class to help with this. If he is moved to trial before classes end, we will have his new family finish them out. \n\nRalphie is neutered, microchipped, HW negative and on prevention. Fully vaccinated. He also comes with a GPS tracking collar because he is a flight risk while he adjusts in his new home. It will come with a 1 year paid subscription. His adoption fee is $250.

After two years of eluding capture, I finally found my way into the TLP family, which helped me get my groove back and now I am ready to find my forever home. \n\nAs far as sizes go, I am all about \"big things come in small packages. But while I may be petite in stature, my heart is huge and my smile is irresistible. Major cuddle sessions with my human, while being wrapped up in a snuggly blanket, is my jam! I am not a super active dog, and while I enjoy getting some daily exercise, I much prefer the comfort of a couch and some Netflix. Please and thank you! \n\nBeing the chill and low-key gal that I am, I would prefer canine pals that can match my energy. Super active dogs are fun to watch from my window, but I would do best with a lower energy pup who wants to lay around and watch movies with me. I haven't personally met a cat yet, but I don't have much of a prey drive and, with proper introductions, would be happy to peacefully coexist with one. \n\nI am house trained, crate trained, and I have the best wiggle butt around. So, what are you waiting for? Apply to meet me!",

Those emails will not be answered.\nAdoption fees for NY dogs is $800 as we are having to use a cargo flying company to bring in the dogs from China. $800 does actually not cover the whole cost. We are fundraising the rest.\n\nThis is Milo. He is a stray from China.\n3 years old. 15 pounds. 55cm in length, 40cm in height\n\n\nHere's what the rescue from China said about this dog:\nCharacter: Passionate, intelligent, loyal, sensitive, gentle.\nPast medical history/health conditions: pelvic fracture before rescue, skin disease. Completely healthy at this stage.\nWhen the original owner took the Milo for a walk, he was hit by a car. He bit the owner when he was hugged by the original owner due to excessive shock and was abandoned by the owner. The volunteers got news and went to the scene to bring the dogs back. After surgery, Milo recovered to health. Now he has a meek personality, smart and enthusiastic, and bright hair. He is a very sweet dog.\n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out the form here:\n\nhttps://homeboundhoundz.com/application-form",

Why this pet is the one for you:This beautiful girl is Maya; she is a shy lady when she first meets people, and her new family will need to be extra patient with her and respectful of her boundaries as she warms up on her own terms. If you can do that for her, Maya will be all too happy to blossom and show you what a great companion she can be! As far as other family members are concerned, any children in Maya's new home are required to be over the age of 10 due to her fearful behavior with strangers, and kiddos can be a bit too enthusiastic for her. She is also not the biggest fan of cats or other dogs, and she must be the one-and-only four-pawed friend in the home. Maya has plenty of energy to spend and enjoys hikes and runs. Her favorite toys have the plastic bottles inside that crackle when chewed. So do you have what this lady is looking for? If so, make an appointment to get to know her further today!

We were rescuing another dog from a tiny shelter in Corona, and mom Astra (last photo), was impounded and was only available for rescue. We snatched her up.  The puppies are adorable fluff balls. As beautiful as Huskies are, it takes a certain lifestyle to own one responsibly. If you are not Husky savvy, please do your research before applying. Astra weighs 44 pounds. We have no idea who dad is.   All dogs in our program are current on all their shots and micro chipped.  Also included is one FREE one on one session with our amazing trainer at his facility in Van Nuys! It is not to be missed. We do not place dogs on a first come first serve basis, but rather to the home best suited for them. An adoption fee, application, and contract are required. All our dogs can be met with an approved application.  We do not place dogs on a first come first serve basis, but rather to the home best suited for them. Thank you for looking at a rescue dog for your next family member! Please direct all questions to shopbnb@gmail.com.",

Those emails will not be answered.\nAdoption fees for NY dogs is $800 as we are having to use a cargo flying company to bring in the dogs from China. $800 does actually not cover the whole cost. We are fundraising the rest.\n\nThis is Sky. He is a stray from China.\n2.5 years old. 25 pounds.\n\n\nHere's what the rescue from China said about this dog:\nI am Sky, I was born in a corner of Dingxiang Lake Garden. This place was originally a rural area. Since the introduction of high-end housing, many people have moved out of this place, but they have left their dogs. It is not uncommon to see a stray dog ??here, but my mother, this extraordinary dog, saved us all. After the five of us were born in the grass, my mother has been rubbing her butt because of a bacterial infection. The volunteer sister was very moved when she saw her returning to the grass with her bleeding butt to breastfeed us and brought our family back to the base. After a while, my mother and little sister were adopted by well-wishers. My third brother went to the United States. The third brother often sent us photos of him riding a yacht and running on a huge lawn. I am very happy to see these. In my dream, I saw that I also have a home. \n\nSky's personality: steady, honest, well-behaved and docile.\n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please fill out the form here:\n\nhttps://homeboundhoundz.com/application-form",

Please email the completed application to newleashrescue2018@gmail.com\n\nThomas is around 2 years old and weighs about 6 pounds.  He is a bit of a shy guy at first and needs some time to warm up- we would recommend him for a quieter home that is used to small dogs.  \n\nDue to his small size and being fragile to squeezing or dropping, we will not place him in a home with kids under age 9.  \n\nHe is good with other dogs, and was just neutered and had a dental cleaning.  He will need a housetraining refresher when moving to a new house and a new routine. \n\nApplications are reviewed in the order received.  \n\nAdoption fee is $450.00 + tax (no checks)\n\nFoster to contact: Katie - kit_n_caboodle22@hotmail.com \n\nThis dog will be at our adoption event at the Woodbury PetSmart on Saturday from 11-2 looking for a home!\n\n\nOur fosters do the best they can to provide all information about the animal's background and temperament while in foster care in their home. An adopters routine and home environment is likely going to be different than that in their foster home. \n\nSometimes there is more that comes out about a dog's personality once they have been able to settle in a home and truly become comfortable. There are great articles out there written about the different stages a pet goes through after adoption, discussing transitions that happen at 3 days, 3 weeks, and 3 months. We highly recommend reading about this - it will help you understand the transition your new pet goes through.",

We were rescuing another dog from a tiny shelter in Corona, and mom Astra (last photo), was impounded and was only available for rescue. We snatched her up.  The puppies are adorable fluff balls. As beautiful as Huskies are, it takes a certain lifestyle to own one responsibly. If you are not Husky savvy, please do your research before applying. Astra weighs 44 pounds. We have no idea who dad is.   All dogs in our program are current on all their shots and micro chipped.  Also included is one FREE one on one session with our amazing trainer at his facility in Van Nuys! It is not to be missed. We do not place dogs on a first come first serve basis, but rather to the home best suited for them. An adoption fee, application, and contract are required. All our dogs can be met with an approved application.  We do not place dogs on a first come first serve basis, but rather to the home best suited for them. Thank you for looking at a rescue dog for your next family member! Please direct all questions to shopbnb@gmail.com.",
