Only experienced adopters please that know what it is like to take care of a diabetic animal.  \n\nMeet sweet Lana- we rescued her from the local kill shelter about a month ago for having a very low body score meaning she was too skinny. Well it turns out she is diabetic and requires insulin shots every 12 hours - and then you wait a half hour after fed to give it to her. \nSometimes it requires two people to help hold her. She\u2019s about 7 pounds and should be 10 pounds. She is strong willed with other dogs small and large and holds her ground if she\u2019s picked on. She has separation anxiety and can not be kenneled due to her urination due to diabetes or she would lay in urine.  We are working on her potty habits and doggie door. She loves to be held and sleeps all night in the bed with you.  She does not like to be babygated she would bark.  She needs a yard and easy fast access to get outside - no apartments or condos as she is very vocal.  I feed her farmers dog and dry food called ketonatural.  She is still going to the vet for glucose curves and still needs spayed.  So if you are willing to put forth the effort to give Lana the safe loving environment that she needs with a very secure yard and financially able to help her please call Mandi at (702) 321-0578 with Ahome4spot of Diana at 702-239-7986. \nShe is a lifetime commitment and was a stray the rest of her life she deserves to be treated like a queen. Slight bision loss do to the diabetes.\n\nSent from my iPhone.  Mandi Dawson ??",

She is not house trained because she lived outdoors previously so her new home would need to be ready to work with her and take her out frequently for \"potty breaks.\" Typically this breed house trains quickly but it does take time and patience.

I am a big boy who loves to run and play, and take nice long walks in the woods. Oh, and I love snuggling up in my blanket too. I create the cutest little cocoon and only have my head poking out- my friends say its adorable, I say its comfy and warm.\n\nI am a big boy and will need a strong owner who can take me for lots of walks and keep me mentally and physically stimulated. And I do need a home all to myself- no kids, cats, dogs, or other animals (please no chickens!!)- but I promise to fill your heart and home with tons of love! Oh and an experienced owner is necessary too. I don't like sharing my stuff so I need someone who has worked with doggos like me before.\n\nDid you fall in love with my goofy smile and charming personality? Give my friends at the Saratoga County Animal Shelter a call to learn more about me! Meets by appointment only. 518-885-4113",

            "description": "Hello! My name is Franklin the Two Dimensional Hound. I am about 3.5 years old.\nMy looks are deceiving. I may LOOK like a tall, handsome fawn Great Dane, but I am, in fact, basically a cat crossed with an anxious blonde. Don\u2019t let that turn you off...I am quite entertaining, and I do love my people. Don\u2019t feel bad for my svelte frame, either - I choose this. A fella\u2019s gotta watch their figure, dontchaknow. (Ever seen Zoolander? It\u2019s not just the females.) I don\u2019t want to be chunky, so I make sure I skip a few meals to keep this lean figure. \n\nSo...I don\u2019t really care much to interact with most other dogs...because OBVIOUSLY I was born in the wrong body, and am a cat. I like to rub on you, back and forth...it\u2019s my favorite. I also like to pretend I want to come in for affection, but then coyly turn away at the last minute so you can\u2019t actually pet me (this is one of my favorite cat tricks... it amuses me to watch the people roll their eyes and throw their hands up in exasperation. Ha ha!) \n\nAnd water?? OMG. *trembles delicately* Even drinking it offends me. Ugh. Why do we even have to do the \u201cwater\u201d thing? Ew ew ew. Dewy grass is so gross, too. Sometimes my foster mom makes me go potty IN THE RAIN and UGH.  I\u2019m super sensitive about...well, pretty much everything. You\u2019re all offensive and I find you mostly contemptible, nerve wracking, and bleh...you gotta give me a minute to \u201cwarm up\u201d to you... But I CAN do it. \n\nI would be super comfortable in a home with other cats like me, but NO DOGS. Well, maybe I\u2019d consent to an alpha female, but that\u2019s it, ok? Dogs are so gross. But I love other cats. \nI get along really well with chickens and stuff too because they\u2019re not scary\n \nMy favorite friend in the house is an orphaned kitten who\u2019s a month old...he likes me, too. He\u2019s not very scary. Usually. Sometimes he bites my toes or swats at my face and I run and hide in my crate, but I AM NOT SCARED, I just...you know. I was tired of playing anyway, and stuff. \nMy mom laughs because he\u2019s a pound and a half, but he\u2019s got sharp things *literally everywhere* and omg I can\u2019t risk marring this handsome face, or my beautiful deer-like feet. \n\nI am looking for a home with very strong adults who won\u2019t let me push them around. No first time dog owners for me!\n\nSo, here\u2019s what my \u201cfoster mom\u201d has to say: Frank would do best in a home as an only dog but is very adaptable to all other animals. He has been compatible with a large alpha female but is still \u201clearning how to dog\u201d politely, so his adopters need to be a bit dog savvy if wanting to add him to a home with another dog. He would do best in a home with older kids, and an experienced owner - he definitely needs his human to be a calm, confident leader who won\u2019t let him get away with every whim. His exercise needs are remarkably low, though he does love to run...he isn\u2019t a dog who will drive you crazy bouncing off the walls. He can take a little time to warm up to men, but always comes around shortly if you\u2019re polite and gentle.  \nHe is so very sweet and loving, and endlessly amusing with his antics.\n\nDogs \u2013 case by case\nCats- yes\nKids \u2013 12+\n\nUpdate Nov 17\n\nHello again! Franklin the Two Dimensional Hound here. I am not called that because of my personality, you see (because I am rather complex), but because I\u2019m a lean mean svelte machine (by choice, thankyouverymuch). \n\nSo, a lot has happened since I checked in with you all last. I\u2019ve become a fully functioning member of the pack here, and I have to say...I\u2019m a lot more relaxed this way. But my foster mom has a unique pack, and I\u2019m also pretty needy...so I\u2019d really prefer to just have a larger alpha female friend, please. Sharing is sometimes annoying. \n\nMy best friends here are actually the orphaned kittens my foster mom has been taking care of. She doesn\u2019t need to remind me often to be \u201ceasy\u201d...I think I understand now. Mostly. The bigger cats still make me a little nervous, but when they\u2019re friendly, that\u2019s really nice. \nSometimes I still like to tease the goats here, but they\u2019re ouchy - those horns hurt. I leave the chickens alone still because foster mom says so. \n\nI recently met a neighbor dog - really cute standard poodle - and we took a walk together, and I had so much fun! Foster mom says we should do it again, and maybe even give a doggy daycare a shot for the \u201csocialization\u201d (?). I mean I\u2019m pretty okay with dogs that aren\u2019t trying to, you know...share things I don\u2019t want to share. Foster mom makes sure they don\u2019t harass me when I have a bone or food or anything, and that makes me happy. \n\nDid I mention I get along well with cats? I feel like this may be important. Also, because I think I may be half cat, myself. Dogcestry.com says they don\u2019t really test for that, but I\u2019d like to believe I\u2019m just a super tall cat. \n\nYou have to be patient with me - disruptions in my routine are kind of upsetting, and sometimes it kills my appetite/upsets my tummy. I would really appreciate a quieter home without a lot of activity, though I am getting super gracious with visitors. They\u2019re not so scary! Foster mom never lets anyone scary mess with me, and I think I know this now, so even strange men are okay after I can have a few good sniffs. \n\nFoster mom says I\u2019d benefit from \u201cgoing to school\u201d, too. Formal \u201ctraining\u201d ?. SHE thinks it would help me be happier, but ...well maybe it would. Maybe I would give it a shot. \nAnyway, although I\u2019m pretty happy now, I know this isn\u2019t my forever place. Would you be interested in a tall, sensitive blonde? I\u2019m really super fun and delightful when I\u2019m comfortable somewhere ??? And, if I might say so myself, I\u2019m pretty gosh darn handsome, to boot.\n\nUpdate 1/8/21\n\nHappy New Year, from Frankie!\n\nFrank\u2019s all about some \u201cNew Year, New Me\u201d. Well, sort of. He\u2019s made amazing strides with his social skills & now is trusted with the pack even when not directly supervised. Yes, even the tiny dog!\n\nHe\u2019s learned appropriate corrections, also. Although his foster mom takes every precaution to avoid triggers like food or high value bones, every once in a while one of the small animals slips through a gate unnoticed & gets a little too close for his liking. Would he make contact, he could really hurt a 2 1/2 pound annoying kitten, but he doesn\u2019t. \n\nIt\u2019s really amazing how wonderful and respectful he is with cats - he grew up with no small animals, and would chase cats in the yard in his original home. He also spends most of his time \u201cdenning\u201d with the miniature dachshund in the home, which is reinforcing his respect for and bond with smaller dogs.\n\nWe do feel his options are broadening, as far as what he can live in harmony with. So far...pretty much everything, as long as the other creature isn\u2019t easily intimidated. He\u2019s still an opportunist and can be a little bit of a bully if the other animal cows to him, but if the cat/dog/hedgehog/goat/chicken on the other end stands up to him when he gets pushy, he backs off. \n\nHis options for dogs he can click with are definitely broadening. His foster family thinks he would be a great candidate for a savvy doggy daycare, to further hone the wonderful social skills he\u2019s learning.  Formal obedience classes are highly recommended (and will be a requirement for his adoption) for Frank! Not only has he never been taught any formal commands (we are making slow progress on this), but a class would both increase his social skills through positive exposure and provide his new person with guidance when he or she inevitably gets stuck. Also, it\u2019s a wonderful bonding experience and increases confidence in both dog and handler!\n\nWe are looking forward to Frank finding his forever home, so he can complete his growth as a more balanced pup. We feel he\u2019ll leave much/most of his anxiety behind, once in a place where he fits in a little better (there are a lot of critters he\u2019s expected to coexist with around here! He would prefer less lol). \n\nFrankie is silly, fun, loving, gentle, and a wonderful companion. He\u2019s also a tall drink of water and turns heads everywhere he goes! He turned 4 on Thanksgiving, and is a healthy and athletic dude.\n\n\nMAGDRL only adopts to approved adopters in NY, NJ, PA MD, DE, D.C.,VA and WV. We are not able to cover full states in some cases.

Armani has so much love to give! She craves attention and will do everything she can to crawl in your lap for cuddles and kisses. Armani weighs 43 lbs at 2 years of age. She loves to play (and destroy) toys, and will play fetch until your arms are worn out!  Armani is currently being fostered with 4 big dogs and has done well.  Armani is still very puppy-like in her behavior and can be domineering while playing so a non-dominant dog companion would be ideal. Given that she is still very mouthy, she would be better suited for a family without small children. Due to her breed, Armani has a high prey drive and has not done well with small dogs (she has not been cat tested).  Armani is housebroken and crate trained (she does not willing go in her crate but once in, settles quickly). She does great on a leash, and loves going for walks. Pictures just don't do this girl justice! Armani is the perfect mix of calm, playful and loving! \n\nPlease visit halfwaythererescue@gmail.com for information on meeting and/or adopting Armani!",

            "description": "Angel is a pretty 7 month old black and rust girl with natural ears and a docked tail. She weighs about 60lbs now, so she\u2019ll likely to be a good size when she\u2019s mature. Angel was turned into a shelter by elderly owners who could not handle her. She had no training what so ever in her previous home. \nShe is very smart and she is responding well using positive training methods. Angel is learning basic obedience cues and how to walk on leash. Angel easily becomes over stimulated/aroused, and then will jump, mouth your hands and run non-stop around the house. Angel is being heavily reinforced for calm behaviors, and this is how she eats her meals throughout the day, as result Angel is starting to make better choices. Although, she is making great strides she still has a ways to go. House training is going well, because Angel is taken out often. Tossing a tasty treat will get Angel into her crate, although she does protest at times especially if her people are moving around the house. Angel happily gets into the car and she rides fairly well. \nAngel will need to be exposed to new things at her own pace and one where she can be successful. Angel requires a fenced in yard (no electric fence). The ideal home for Angel will be a calm structured household with owners who are experienced with working breed dogs. She\u2019ll need an owner who is patient, consistent and fair. Someone who understands the importance of both mental stimulation and physical activity. If not challenged mentally, Angel will find her own fun and that likely will not be appreciated. Angel would likely do well with scent work, tricks or some other type of dog activity. Angel likes other dogs, but she can be obnoxious and off putting to other dogs, so she will be placed as an only dog. She deserves to have someone committed entirely to her and provide what she\u2019s missed out on in her early months. \nDAR&E places dogs in MD, DC, VA and parts of WVA only.  \nIf you are interested in this pet please follow the link below to read about our adoption process and submit an adoption application.

            "description": "Angel is a pretty 7 month old black and rust girl with natural ears and a docked tail. She weighs about 60lbs now, so she\u2019ll likely to be a good size when she\u2019s mature. Angel was turned into a shelter by elderly owners who could not handle her. She had no training what so ever in her previous home. \nShe is very smart and she is responding well using positive training methods. Angel is learning basic obedience cues and how to walk on leash. Angel easily becomes over stimulated/aroused, and then will jump, mouth your hands and run non-stop around the house. Angel is being heavily reinforced for calm behaviors, and this is how she eats her meals throughout the day, as result Angel is starting to make better choices. Although, she is making great strides she still has a ways to go. House training is going well, because Angel is taken out often. Tossing a tasty treat will get Angel into her crate, although she does protest at times especially if her people are moving around the house. Angel happily gets into the car and she rides fairly well. \nAngel will need to be exposed to new things at her own pace and one where she can be successful. Angel requires a fenced in yard (no electric fence). The ideal home for Angel will be a calm structured household with owners who are experienced with working breed dogs. She\u2019ll need an owner who is patient, consistent and fair. Someone who understands the importance of both mental stimulation and physical activity. If not challenged mentally, Angel will find her own fun and that likely will not be appreciated. Angel would likely do well with scent work, tricks or some other type of dog activity. Angel likes other dogs, but she can be obnoxious and off putting to other dogs, so she will be placed as an only dog. She deserves to have someone committed entirely to her and provide what she\u2019s missed out on in her early months. \nDAR&E places dogs in MD, DC, VA and parts of WVA only.  \nIf you are interested in this pet please follow the link below to read about our adoption process and submit an adoption application.

            "description": "**ADOPTION PENDING **\n\nHello!\n\n My name is Jovie and I am a 4 1/2 year old green-eyed American Bulldog/Mastiff mix.\n\n My favourite things are walk time, dinner time, and cuddle time. I am a total sweetheart and very affectionate with my foster humans. I love to get silly rolling around on the carpet and stretching out real long.\n\n I am super strong and athletic (my foster mom thinks I'd be great at agility), but content with a couple walks per day and a run in the yard. My ears do this adorable thing where they get stuck back when I run, because they are so floppy. I still have some work to do on my leash walking as I can get a little over stimulated when there is lots going on and forget to walk nicely. But my foster mom says I have made good progress and keep getting better as I get more acclimated to the sniffs, sights and sounds around me. I am a quick learner and love training time because I am very food motivated and enjoy any time spent with my humans.\n\n While at home I'm pretty easy going, quiet and happy to chill out and nap while my foster parents are working and doing other boring things. I follow my humans around the house and don't like being left alone, but if you hang out with me for a bit while I chill in my crate I should be ok when you leave the house (though the pandemic has meant that my foster parents are usually around). I am house broken and sleep through the night in my crate without a peep, and though I prefer if the crate is near my humans I can probably learn to sleep on my own with a little patience. \n\n I enjoy meeting new people and am good with strangers, but it's best to take it slow because I can be a little nervous. Spend a few minutes cuddling me or giving me treats and I'll be your best gal. I do not have very good doggie social skills. I have had success making friends with slow introductions and distanced walks, but I am hyper stimulated when meeting dogs for the first time and don't know how to play safe. I would do best in an environment without other dogs, or with an owner who is experienced in managing new relationships. I am apparently good with kids, but haven't met too many.\n\n Did I mention how pretty I am? Oh yeah, I get complimented on my looks all the time, no big deal. Just one look into these green eyes and you'll know what I'm talking about.\n\n- Jovie is being fostered in Toronto\n- we will be reviewing applications after her dental on Jan 18th",

            "description": "Daisy is a stocky low rider, 5 years old and 60 lbs. of love, who is a bit nervous when she first meets new people. She clearly wasn\u2019t treated well early on but she warms up quickly and becomes a goofy, wiggly cuddle bug. This girl loves to cuddle. She\u2019d lie on top of you if you let her. Daisy wants to please and listens well and learns the rules quickly. She is potty trained and mellow in the house and gets along wonderfully with the other female dog and friends dogs that she has been introduced to. She can be aggressive to dogs outside her home or pack so she will need to be on leash or in a yard at all times. She does have some separation anxiety but does well with bones or toys to chew while you are gone. She doesn\u2019t know her own strength and wants to play with excited kids and can knock them down so she will be best in a home with no small kids.  If you are interested in knowing more about Miss Daisy please email hellopittyrescue@gmail.com and include your phone number.",

Our veterinary partner estimates that Amelia is a year old at the time of intake in December 2020. Amelia is good with people and other dogs. This beautiful brindle girl was dumped at a kill shelter in an advanced stage of pregnancy. Amelia tried so hard to avoid delivering her puppies in the risky atmosphere of a kill shelter, but with nowhere to go, she had no choice. Fortunately, we got Amelia and her puppies out of there as soon as we discovered them and before any harm came to them. They are now living a life of luxury in a foster home. Soon Amelia will be an empty nester and she will go off to live a happy life. Amelia is a very sweet pup and a wonderful Momma. If you would like to be Amelia's forever family waiting for her with open arms, please apply online to adopt Amelia (TX) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

She is 9 years old, current on shots, already spayed, and missing her home life setting. Owner told the shelter she can be selective with her canine friends but is a love and super sweet girl. She\u2019s happy and loves going for walks and playing in the runner at the shelter. She will run after a tennis ball when thrown but doesn\u2019t always retrieve it. Loves soaking up body rubs and affection and so deserves a loving FOREVER home to enjoy her \u201cgolden years\u201d being pampered and loved. Maybe you have the most amazing loving FOREVER home for Lexie?! Visit with her today! \nIf you have another dog and are interested in meeting another potential new furry member please bring him or her to the shelter and meet on neutral ground before adopting. No need to shuffle the animals around any more than necessary. Please know that 1 mosquito bite can create heart worms and they can be fatal if not treated. It is VERY important to keep your pets healthy and protected by keeping them on a once a month heart worm and flea/tick prevention. These animals are counting on you as their owner to provide them with lots a love and the proper health care so PLEASE make sure you are aware and prepared before adopting. Owning a pet is an extra expense and responsibility but is so worth every minute and penny you invest in them. They will add lots of joy and unconditional love if given a fair chance.\nThe shelter is open Mon.-Fri. 10-1, 2-5 and Sat. 10-4. Adopt a homeless pet and save a life. If you can not adopt right now come out and volunteer and make a difference in the lives of these animals while they await their FOREVER home.",

            "description": "Meet this sweetheart named Harker! She came into the shelter January 2, 2021 when her owner could no longer keep her or her sister Hattie. We were told they were both pulled from a not good situation and we\u2019re nursed back to good health...we\u2019re super underweight. They have been great at the shelter. Super loving and sweet and have \u201cseparately\u201dplayed with a few other male dogs and have been good. The owners said they didn\u2019t always get along which is common with sibling pups. They did say she can be protective of her people when other dogs come up for attention. She is hyper and is jumpy  but very typical of the breed. She is kennel trained and enjoys playing fetch with a tennis ball. She can be an escape artist is left unattended outside. She enjoys chewing and digging so keeping toys around for her to enjoy playing with is good. She\u2019s scared a little of loud  noises and thunder.  Owner recommended a home without other animals but said she was good with older children since she is jumpy and could knock a little kid down not intentionally. Harker is pretty new and sometimes we see behaviors the longer they are there or maybe it was a situational issue within the living arrangements, or maybe just be separated away from her sister will clear the issue of a home without other animals. She\u2019s been super friendly and loving. Stop by for a visit with Hattie today and adopt her into your heart and home! \nIf you have another dog and are interested in meeting another potential new furry member please bring him or her to the shelter and meet on neutral ground before adopting. No need to shuffle the animals around any more than necessary. Please know that 1 mosquito bite can create heart worms and they can be fatal if not treated. It is VERY important to keep your pets healthy and protected by keeping them on a once a month heart worm and flea/tick prevention. These animals are counting on you as their owner to provide them with lots a love and the proper health care so PLEASE make sure you are aware and prepared before adopting. Owning a pet is an extra expense and responsibility but is so worth every minute and penny you invest in them. They will add lots of joy and unconditional love if given a fair chance.\nThe shelter is open Mon.-Fri. 10-1, 2-5 and Sat. 10-4. Adopt a homeless pet and save a life. If you can not adopt right now come out and volunteer and make a difference in the lives of these animals while they await their FOREVER home.",

            "description": "Happy Jack\n2 years old, 50 pounds\nPit Bull Terrier Mix\n\nHappy Jack came to our southern partner rescue several months ago, after they received a call about an emaciated Pit Bull tied to a telephone pole in a dangerous part of Jackson, MS. He had a chemical burn all the way down his back and he also had heartworm. \n\nHe\u2019s really sweet and he is always happy, thus the name. He is full of of energy and just wants to play. Jack has been in boarding for almost 5 months now so it is way past time for him to be in a home. He deserves so much better than living in a kennel. He has completed heartworm treatment and is now 4dx negative.  \n\nJack would make a great adventure or hiking companion! He does have a lot of energy! Jack is kennel trained and plays well with other dogs. He plays really hard so he needs another dog his size who loves to play as much as he does. He does great around kids, older kids would be best due to his high energy. And no cats please. He would do best having a fenced yard or be adopted by some who runs a lot! \n\nDue to COVID-19 travel restrictions, we are only accepting applications from residents in ME, NH and VT.\" \n\nAdoption Fee: $450 (this covers previous expenses of the dog- appropriate vaccinations, altering, microchipping, and transportation fees.)   \n\nIn an effort to \"flatten the curve\" of the recent pandemic climate, our Rescue has implemented a new protocol for adoptions. In-person meet & greets are on \"paws\" in an effort to limit exposure to others. Instead, we are happy to provide a video as a way to \"meet\" the dog before bringing it home, and ultimately limiting exposure for you and our foster families to just the pick up (which can be done safely outdoors).  \n\nPlease copy and paste this link to complete an application: www.fetchinghope.com/adopt",

FOREVER HOME MUST HAVE A FRIENDLY, PLAYFUL AND CONFIDENT RESIDENT DOG!\n\nMEET CONNER, an handsome, friendly and fun-loving 10 month old, 45lb lab mix looking for a loving home preferably with a experienced and active guardian and a friendly, non-senior, playful resident dog. Conner is with an awesome foster mom who has lots of good stuff to share about this fabulous pup:\n\n\"Conner is a very sweet and cuddly boy who loves ear scratches, back scratches and bum scratches too. He is very loving and affectionate and melts like butter when you rub his belly A 15-week-old puppy is his best friend and he is so good with her despite being four times her size--he's very patient and gentle and loves playing with her. Being only 10 months old, he's a good listener, a quick study and highly treat and praise motivated. Training the two of them is great fun! He's a smart dog, and is crate and leash trained and housebroken. He loves chewing on Kong toys (and most anything left on his floor), playing with stuffed animals, being outside (but not alone) and running around. He's got the right amount of energy for a 10-month-old boy. He's adventurous and will make an awesome hiking or jogging buddy. He is also very sweet with Lacey who has high anxiety and who's not very playful. He will benefit from ongoing training and confidence building exercises. He's a very sweet pup who is going to make an awesome companion.\"\n\nHe is neutered and up to date on age-appropriate vaccines. His adoption fee is $425. Please note that training is highly recommended for all dogs. As with all rescue animals, breed determination cannot be validated without genetic testing.\n\nTHANKS FOR ADOPTING AND SAVING A LIFE; you are CONNER'S hero!",

We had since all healed up with no noticeable scars. He is receiving treatment for heartworm infection which is curable and not contagious once treatment has begun. I hope there is someone out there that will give sweet Lamb a chance. He is not friendly with other dogs at this point most likely because of fear after the dog fight where he got superficial wounds. Fairly good on a leash. He is very loving with people! Please come and meet this boy!",

            "description": "Apple is a 58 lb 7-8 yr old American Staffordshire mix that has one blind eye from a stab wound. She was protecting her owner and later ended up abandoned at the animal shelter by the same owner. She is almost finished with her heartworm treatment. We cover that for cost and do it at the rescue. She is such a sweet dog! Has gotten along with other dogs but doesn't like them in her face. So probably a meet and greet would be recommended for anyone with another dog or she would be great as an only pet because she loves to give lovin to people! Please think about this sweet girl she deserves a happy ending after the hell she has been through.

We can not arrange meet & greet without an application.\n\nAdoption fees: $450 for dogs 12 months/younger, $400 for dogs 1-2 Yrs,\n$350 for dogs 3-5yrs, and $300 for 6yrs and older\n\nSammy is about 14 months old. He was pulled from the shelter with a broken leg. We amputated the leg and we have been preparing Sammy for family life.\n\nSammy was definitely abused and he has been in a foster home with another dog, he is cat friendly and is slow to trust people.\n\nSammy is lovely when you become part of his pack. He navigates around on three legs like a pro. He loves walks both on and off leash. He loves to chase squirrels and belly rubs.\n\nWe know Sammy is going to need to be in a home with a patience family. He loves older kids, and other dogs. He is approximately 55lbs and he has no idea he only had three legs.\n\nEveryone who has met Sammy had fallen in love. He just has to love you! Sammys wish list. Someone who does not give up, loving, is patience, loves to walk, and loves to give belly rubs.\n\nSammy does come with a bean bag, his security blanket. No bean bag, no deal!!\n\nSammy is fully vaccinated and neutered and comes with only 3 legs! \n\nSammy is fully vaccinated\n\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please review our adoption process and then fill out an online adoption form at https://www.calpaws.org/adopting. Experience with obedience training is definitely preferred. We are a small rescue and do not have the resources to respond to inquiries. If a dog is our website, it is still available. We can not arrange meet & greet without an application.\n\nWe are always in need of fosters for the amount of dogs we have coming in. Being a foster is such a rewarding experience.

            "description": "Hi, my name is Hero. I'm a a very sweet, 3 year old, 72lb. male GSD who's just settling in at my foster home. In my previous life, I lived in a home with older children and a female GSD, but unfortunately I was not given much training and was allowed to get out, soooo I made some bad choices. That's how I ended up in the shelter. Right now I'm just trying to figure out what's expected of me. I'm great with people. and other dogs, but I'm not a fan of cats at all. I am house trained and I am working on crate training. I love to ride in the car and play with a ball. While here, I'm working on Place, Sit, waiting through thresholds and walking on a loose leash. I attended the EDH pack walk and did well with the people and some 25 plus dogs that walked with us. I can get excited when I see another dog, but all you have to do is remind me, and I redirect well. I'm actually pretty calm. All I really want is to be with my person. I'm a very quick learner and would love to be in a structured house with a GSD saavy family and another dog to play with. Could you be my forever home? More to come on me once I've had time to adjust to my new surroundings. I'm neutered, heartworm negative, microchipped and current on vaccinations. Minimum adoption donation: $350.00\n\nTo fill out an application for Hero, please copy and paste the link below. \n\nhttps://petstablished.com/adoptions/personal-information?application_type=Adopt&pet_id=943617",

Currently Alvin is settling in at the ranch where we'll take the time to access his needs to help us choose the right forever home for him. \n\nAlvin is a insecure shy dog and is currently very scared during this transition. We feel he would do best in a quiet home that allows him to decompress at his pace. He LOVES his crate and takes a lot of comfort in using this safe space. He was house trained in his previous home. We'll post updates as Alvin comes out of his shell and we get to know him better.

            "description": "RJ has had a rough time of it in his short life as you can see by his face. What happened to him exactly is still not clear to us. He was living tied up outside and clearly not given the best care. He's very nervous at the shelter and very very slow to make up to people.. RJ will not be a social butterfly anytime soon so he's looking for a quiet home to learn how to be part of a family inside a home. We haven't learned a lot about RJ yet as he's so nervous still. A home with adults only or teenage children that is calm and can give RJ a lot of time to decompress and come around to his new people would be best. RJ is believed to be a pit bull mix of about 2 years old. He weighs 66 lbs and as you can see has some physical healing to do yet. \n\nWe have no way to test for cat or other small animal compatibility. However, we do offer a 5 day foster-to-adopt program to those who live within an hour of Chillicothe, OH. This will allow you time to figure out if this dog is compatible for you. If not, simply bring the dog back and if it's a great fit you just come back and adopt. \n\nIf you are interested in one of our dogs please go to rosscountyhumanesociety.org and fill out the online application. Once approved we will contact you to schedule an appointment to meet the dog.RCHS does not conduct DNA tests on dogs who enter our facility therefore we are unable to guarantee breed or breed mix. Information provided by shelter staff, volunteers, and veterinarians is used to give a best estimate as to a dog's breed make up. We do our best to inform adopters about the potential breeds for each dog.\n\nWe are a dog only facility so we do not know how most of our dogs will be with cats. Even if a dog is surrendered to us and said to be good with cats there is no way to be sure the dog will be good with your cats. We do have a 7 day foster-to-adopt program so that you can see how the dog interacts with your cats before adoption.",

            "description": "Midgie: She is a 5 year old Chihuahua Dachshund mix. We are looking for a home with no other dogs because she would prefer to be an only dog. She is good with kids and cats. She is mostly house trained but will have accidents on occasion when she is too stiff to get outside on time. She has been very neglected by her previous owners but has made alot of improvements, last year she suffered a tear to her hip muscle and has some trouble walking, but has been making alot of progress in her physical therapy. She is more of a lap dog but laying around causes her to get stiff and she needs help to get back up. Her nails are overgrown but with constant grooming appointments they should get back to normal. She does not like to play with toys but loves her chew bones and a nice bed to curl up on or even laying on the sofa. Overall she loves people but will need extra care.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting and/or adopting this baby, please fill out an application. They currently are fixed, up to date on shots, wormings, preventatives and are microchipped. Adoption fee is $188 ($175 Adoption Fee + $13 Lifetime Registration Fee for Microchip), applications can be filled out at this link. https://www.petstablished.com/adoption_form/10167/generic .We cannot guarantee breed or size when full grown.\n\nDue to our current situation, with more great applicants than we have available puppies and young adults, we are no longer accepting applications from people that are over 150 miles away. Exceptions will be made on dogs over the age of 3, special needs dogs and direct referrals from our volunteers.",

            "description": "Hi there, Im Orville (like the Wright brother or the popcorn guy) and Im happy to now live in Colorado. I am told I am one of the most handsome dogs. I am looking for my forever home and promise to be the best dog possible. I am around 1 years old and only 45 pounds. I was found hanging around a Knights of Columbus office in Texas and was taken to a shelter. After being excited to get my own home and people, I became more and more sad that no one came and brought me to a home of my own. I know that coming to Colorado is my chance to find a home of my own that I can share with a loving family\n\n \n\nWhile I have been adjusting to being in a loving home, I have needed some extra TLC. I have been good with other dogs and some older children (11 & 14) while I adjust to being cared for. Im happy in my kennel as I have found it to be a good place to feel safe and secure.\n\n\nNOTE: After arriving at the shelter in Texas, staff noticed that Orville had a limp and although he didn't have a pain response, they performed x-rays anyway. It appears that he may have experienced past trauma to his left pelvic area.\n\n \n\n \n\n*Homeownership Required!\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

Literally everyone we spoke with at 2BABR about Minnie said, I love her! We agree. Whats not to love? Shes a beautiful German Short-haired Pointer mix who wants to jump right into your heart. Shes great with the kids and loves affection, particularly having her belly rubbed.\n\n \n\nWeighing in at 53lbs shes a wiggling, waggly bundle of affection. We dont know much about Minnies past - she was rescued from a shelter in New Mexico and is about 3 years old. Shes recovering beautifully from being spayed upon arrival in Colorado. \n\n \n\nShes inquisitive and wants to see everything Im up to in the kitchen, but responds well to correction when I remind her not to be so nosy. She prances proudly on walks and responds well to my direction when weve encountered other dogs. She travels well in a harness in the car and her tail wags wildly when she greets the kids (ages 9,11, and 14).\n\n \n\nShe didnt know what to make of the kennel at first, but were working together to help her feel it is her safe space. And now she will gladly go into it in order to eat her dinner and sleep at night. And she has good house manners!\n\n \n\nMinnie would make a beautiful addition to any family that wants to love a dog as much as she loves you!\n\n \n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

Lila is very shy but once she feels safe and can trust her environment she will open up. Lila only wants to be accepted into a family that will give her the love she deserves. Since being with her foster family she has made friends with the other 2 dogs in the house. She has also started to remember what it's like to be a dog; she's starting to run in the yard and play. Lila is very well behaved so she must have had some training in her past. She is house trained, doesn't mind her crate but would prefer to chill near her family. If you are looking for an easy going dog that will give as much love as she gets, Lila is definitely the one for you.\n\n \n\n*Homeownership Required!\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

Ive learned to sit & wait patiently for my food until given the release command. Were working on stay & coming when called. \n\nAfter a few attempts, I love my walks now & Im excited to see the world. Things can still be a little scary & Ill let you know when its time to head back home.\n\nChasing balls is my favorite game & Ill even return the ball so you can throw it again. Im potty trained & love to snuggle up with my foster mom & take naps. I keep watch over things & will let you know when I see something.\n\nI will be an awesome boy with the right family & cant wait to meet you!\n\n \n\n**Homeownership Required!\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

He's glad to help, or just bask in the sun. And if you want to talk to him, he's happy to listen and then come to you for some loving. His slow-wagging tail will warm your heart. This well-mannered senior boy is sharing his foster home with five other dogs, and he just hangs out with them. The cats in his foster home he either ignores - or naps with them. He's also really good with small children, greeting them and wandering off. He's also a wonderful leash walker and rides well in the car's front seat, gazing out the window, so happy to see cows. At home, Elroy is content to be in the same room with his people, coming up for some loving with his slow tail wag. And then he's happy to go find his bed for long naps. He understands and obeys all commands, and he's a house-trained boy who will go in a crate, but doesn't need to. He's free to roam the house and does well when home alone. Elroy's age has brought some teeth and vision problems, and he needs eye medication twice a day. He will do best in a quiet, slow-paced home where he can have short walks and long naps - and loving. Come meet him. He'll be your lovable and perfect roommate!",

She's currently living with an APA foster family and would love to join your home. Issa likes to keep things simple. Her preferred activities are going for walks and snuggling up with her favorite people! She's always on the lookout for affection. She'd love to be a lap dog all day. Since cuddling can't fill up a whole day, Issa also likes to head out for exercise. She's been getting the hang of leash walking with her foster family, and will be ready to head out for a stroll with you. In her foster home Issa has been doing well with the older children in the home, and she likes to play with the dog next door. She can be shy when meeting new people but usually warms up quickly. She will go right into her crate, and is working on her basic obedience commands. We've found Issa to be playful, gentle, and loving. She likes some activity each day but mostly wants to be with you. She would enjoy sharing a home with children, but would do best as the only pet until she settles in and receives a bit more training. She has all the makings of a fantastic long-term companion for your family. And don't forget, when you adopt from APA you won't just be giving Issa a good home - you'll also be helping the next dog who can join us!",

Now that he's living with them, he's already learned that they let him roll around in the yard and play with toys. Wow! This very strong and energetic boy has recovered from an injury to his leg and hip, and now he loves to run off at warp speed for a sprint in the garden, and is ready to start learning about leash walking. He also is so happy to feel safe in a home. He still has some separation anxiety and wants to be with his people all the time, eager to be their absolute sweetheart and get their attention. He's also living with two other Boxers, and has shown no aggression to them. And he's doing well with the fosters' 12-year-old and teenage kids. French is a very curious, playful and mischievous boy who has begun to understand some requests from his people, and he seems ready to begin learning from their training. And he's a house-trained boy who's doing well in his crate (as long as he can chew his toys). He's also an affectionate boy who comes out in the morning and leans on his people. This highly energetic, loving young boy hopes to be the only pup in a home with equally energetic, active and patient adults and older teenagers who can continue his training and a yard to run and roam. Come meet him, for sure, he'll want to be your new best friend!",

            "description": "Despite his regal name, King Triton appreciates the simple things in life - playing with his toys, snuggling, and most of all, being with his people. Whenever you're together, KT (as he's affectionately called) will curl up at your feet or stretch out on a nearby dog bed and chill. If and when you're ready to play, he can cut loose and be a goofy boy. You couldn't ask for a more adoring companion, with obedience skills to boot! King Triton is living with separation anxiety, a debilitating panic disorder that can be improved in a majority of cases with the right tools. To KT, there is nothing scarier than the thought of being alone. When he does, he might bark or cry and is destructive. APA! is seeking a qualified adopter to help KT have a chance at a happy life and improve his mental health by working closely with a veterinarian and a professional behavior team that will guide the adopter through a customized training program with the support of behavioral medication. It is critically important that an adopter rearrange their lifestyle to prevent KT from actually being alone for at least the first few months of his life in his new home. Even being away for more than 5 minutes might be too much for him to tolerate at first, but in time with the right professional support - and a village of volunteers to help the adopter cover absences - he will learn to tolerate absences. This will require creativity and dedication. But as the saying goes, it takes a village, and this boy has one! APA! has a devoted group of volunteers who can watch him when friends, family, neighbors and other creative solutions fall short. An ideal home for King Triton would be one with only adults or mature teenagers, low traffic, a yard to romp in, and a patient, caring person willing to put in the extra work to treat and manage his separation anxiety at first. He might be able to live with a well-matched dog - he has a lady dog friend at APA!. In exchange for helping him through this, you will get the devoted companion of a lifetime. Inquire about adopting today and come meet this handsome boy! Follow the life and times of KT on Instagram @adopt_my_friends_at_apa!.",

We are a foster based rescue. There is no facility to visit.\u00a0\n\nThis face, those grey whiskers.....we love this guy.  Charles is a sensitive boy who is ready to find his forever family.  He would love a family that will include him in outdoor adventures like hiking, swimming, running and walking.  He is strong and he is learning how to walk on a leash.  Charles just wants to please his people which will make him very easy to train.\n\nCharles has spent time with other dogs and would do well with a calm doggie friend who will teach him how to relax and enjoy life. He tends to be protective of his people and another confident dog will help him learn when to protect and when to relax. Charles loves to spend time outside and will need a home with a securely fenced yard. No apartments for this big boy.\nThis guy is very playful and might think it's fun to chase the resident cat so any cats in the home should be dog savvy.\n\nCharles recently received a dental and had a gingival mass removed.  The mass was benign.  He had many fleas when he was rescued and had quite a bit of hair loss because of that.  It is recommended that his adopter continue with soothing baths as needed to keep his skin healthy and aid in the continued growth of his coat.  \nCharles is 10 years old and weighs 75 pounds.\n\nAdoption fee is $150.00\nSave-A-Mutt is a registered 501c3.\n\nPlease note, we have approximately a 300 mile adoption radius. We don\u2019t ship dogs, once approved you must pick them up in Snohomish County, WA\u00a0*Due to the Border Closure to Canada - we are currently not accepting Canadian Adoption Applications*.

He enjoys playing with other dogs but prefers to have his OWN space when it comes to feeding him. It is be best to feed him separate from any dogs in the household, \n\nHe is a well-natured boy who will make a great companion to any adopter. He is good with kids and adults and most dogs as long as they're not near his food bowl. He is neutered and up to date on all shots and preventatives. His adoption donation is $250.\n\nDillon is currently in South Carolina with our partner rescue. We can arrange a video-chat with Dillon so you can see him interact in real time with his care-giver and other dogs prior to adoption.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Dillon we can arrange a door-to-door, one-on-one home delivery transport by our experienced transport partner. Transport fee is a separate fee and is negotiated directly with our transport partner.\n\nPlease COPY and PASTE our adopt application LINK into your browser if you are interested in applying to adopt Dillon:\nhttps://form.jotform.com/GFS_nj/ADOPT_FOSTER_Application\n\nWe will contact you immediately.",

            "description": "BACKGROUND:  Webster is a beautiful boy who came into rescue with some emotional baggage. He had a bad attitude and didn't seem to like anyone. We've been working with him and Webster has made huge improvements. He will need a home with someone who understands him and is the \"pack leader.\" As you can see, Webster can be a very gentle dog .... well until he sees bubbles! He loves to play ball, and that is a good icebreaker for him when he meets new people. \n\nADOPTION INFO:  Webster's adoption fee is $395.00, which includes a physical exam, vaccinations, neuter, heartworm test, deworming and any other care received while in rescue.  If you would like to adopt Webster, please complete an application on our website at: www.HoustonBostonRescue.org   \n\nFACEBOOK:  Be sure to follow our current events and new incoming rescues on our Facebook page at:  Facebook,com/BostonTerrierRescue \n\nVIRTUAL FOSTERING:  If you are unable to foster in person, but would still like to help, you can become a virtual foster!  For as little as $20,00 a month, you can virtually foster any of our rescues!  More information can be found on our website at:  www.HoustonBostonRescue.org\n\nNOTE:  All of our foster parents and volunteers work full-time, so please respect  their personal time. Our rescues are available to meet once your application has been approved. Thank you for your understanding!",

By the time the foster had arrived to save her many of her puppies had not survived. Bella is a fantastic dog. She is just a happy girl 247. In her foster home she is best known for greeting everyone who comes in with a smile, tail wagging, and just wanting attention. She gets along well with other dogs and does just fine with the kitty in her home. She is estimated to be about 2-2.5yrs old, weighs 51lbs, and we are guessing that she is a lab/pit cross.\n\nAdoption Application:\nhttps://airtable.com/shr305FuyR4v4JWQb\n\nFacebook Link:\nhttps://m.facebook.com/furrytalesanimalrescue/\n\nWebsite Link: https://furrytalesrescue.wixsite.com/home\n\n** We are based out of Blue Bell, PA. We allow out of state adoptions to NJ, MD, DE, and NY. At this time we do not adopt out to homes who are over 120 miles from our location. We do prioritize more local applications who are a match for the dog/puppy they are applying for.**\n",

He loves people, allows all handling including baths and being carried like a baby. He loves running, cuddling and giving kisses. He could use a little bit of leash training, but he is so eager to please. Due to his size, we are looking for a home with no small kids or small pets. A dog his size could work, but of course a meet and greet would be required.  His ideal home will have pit experience, and appreciate how loving, loyal, silly, pitties can be. Please give this guy a chance and inquire about him today!",

            "description": "Hi, there! I'm Ivy and I am a lab mix. Foster mom thinks I might be mixed with giraffe, brontosaurus, or even anaconda because I have a longish neck. I also have lovely long legs so I look like a horse when I run. I am actually a pretty laid-back girl even though I'm only one year old. I know how to sit, shake a paw, and come when called, and my crate training is going well. I will do just about anything for food or treats. Oh yeah, I'm also house trained. I'm still working on the leash thing though. I keep forgetting that it's not one of my toys. I do enjoy cuddles and belly rubs. I would love to be included in family activities because I love being with my humans. I would probably do best with a family with older kids because of my size, and I'd love to have another dog to romp with.\n\nPlease visit our website at tmhpr.com for more information.

            "description": "Snapshot of Amethyst!\n\nSize?\nLarge, 60 lbs\n\nAge?\n2 years\n\nActivity Level?\nI play hard and I snuggle hard!\n\nNoise Level?\nI like to alert you to something new, but quiet down quickly.\n\nGood with Dogs?\nI'd love a playmate.\n\nGood with Cats?\nUntested, but likely fine. A strong \"leave it\" command may be required!\n\nGood with Kids?\n\nUntested, but likely fine!\n\nGood with Strangers?\nI love everyone!\n\nPotty Trained?\nI'm a pro!\n\nCrate Trained?\nI love my crate!\n\nInterested? Learn more about Amethyst below!\n\nHi! I'm Amethyst! I'm a super enthusiastic female boxer mix, about two years old. I was with a foster in Texas originally and made the long journey to now be with one in Minnesota! I am a mama dog and had a litter of puppies about three months ago. I have tons of energy and love to spend my days going on walks and playing tug of war, but also napping and cuddling up to my people. I don't live with a second dog at the moment but don't have any problems with other canines - the one next door and I communicate often with a single bark on each side, as acknowledgement!\n\nI'm what the humans call \"super sweet\"- there's nothing I love doing more than snuggling up with my person on the couch or on the bed, with a fluffy blanket. I do have my own bed and it's alright, most of the time - give me the couch any day, though! I am still learning the concept of personal space; but my foster mom says I'm getting better at it, slowly but surely. I do know a few tricks and can do them without treats - I sit, lay down (occasionally), give paw, and stay quite well. My foster mom taught me to sit before my leash is put on and taken off before and after we go out on a walk. I also know to sit and wait while my food is dished out - I don't eat until I hear the word \"okay\", and I'm quite proud to say I do it well! I am a very good kennel dog- I walk into my crate with no problems and will curl up there when told. I do have a hard time keeping quiet when I know it's time to go out, or - on occasion - when I see my foster mom doing things around the room that I really, really want to help out with. I'm working on that, though! I'm also quite good with food - I don't ever steal food off my foster mom's plate or grab food out of her hands. I'm more a believer in the method of sitting by her with my puppy eyes and hoping I get a reward for being good! Walks are my favorite part of the day (after cuddles) and I love to be outside. I do get cold easily so my walks aren't very long :) I believe the world is a great big wonderful place that needs to be explored so I am quite an enthusiastic walker, walking ahead of my foster mom and being sure to check out every sight and smell before she does. I do pull occasionally- come on, which dog doesn't?- when there is something that absolutely needs my immediate attention, like a squirrel or a human passing by or a fellow canine. Again, that's something I'm working on, day by day! I absolutely love curling up next to my people and will put my head on their laps or right by theirs just to show them how much I love them. I am still learning to love the car - I get very anxious when the car is moving, so I'm looking for a family that can help me learn that the car is a safe space!\n\nI get attached to my people very easily and tend to like to follow them around everywhere because it is imperative that I keep an eye on them, just to make sure they're safe. With that being said, I would love to be a part of a family that has more than one person for me to shower my love on! I also sometimes get afraid of being alone, so being in a family would help me to get used to both cuddle time and alone time with every person there. I do have a ton of energy and sometimes forget just how big I am so my foster mom thinks that I should definitely be supervised when around kids. However, I am a great listener and a quick learner so can adapt really well to my forever home's lifestyle\n!\n\nAbout Amethyst:\n\nAdoption Fee: $450\n\n*Foster to Adopt: I am looking for a forever home now, but I still need to be spayed! So, I'm looking for a family that will be able to commit to bringing me to my spay appointment on\nSaturday, Feb 13th.\n\nTCPR will be responsible for this\n\nappointment as long as my new family will bring me to it!\n\nThen once medically cleared, I'll be fully ready to be adopted!\n\nMEET ME/ADOPT ME: If you'd like to arrange a meeting or begin the adoption process, please fill out an adoption application by visiting www.twincitiespetrescue.org/adopt/adopt-a-dog/ . A volunteer from Twin Cities Pet Rescue will contact you once your application is reviewed.\n\nFOSTER HOMES NEEDED!!! Twin Cities Pet Rescue is a volunteer-run, foster home-based organization.

Needs a submissive play buddy or only dog\nNo experience with cats but don\u2019t think she would do well\n Shouldn\u2019t be with small children. Could knock down, easily excitable and somewhat reactive if startled\n Located near Johnstown/ New Albany\n\nI am an 11-month old girl with lots of puppy energy. My foster mom says I am super sweet and a very good girl with a few quirks mostly as a result of my blindness. I do best with a structured day so I know what to expect and I love my CBJ oil! Barking is my primary communication method since I am totally blind. I don\u2019t bark much while out of my crate unless I am playing, not sure what or who is around, or if I hear a strange sound on TV. I haven\u2019t been around cats but my foster mom says she doesn\u2019t think it would be a good idea to live with one. I also shouldn\u2019t have small kids around since I cannot see and have so much puppy energy. I don\u2019t want to bump into them or scare them if I bark because I am not sure who they are.\n \nMy ideal home will have a fenced yard and neighboring or visiting playful dogs but I would do best as an only dog. An apartment or condo where neighbors are sharing walls isn\u2019t a good place for me since I bark when first put in my crate or when I am startled. With all of my puppy energy, I really need to get lots of play time. Squeaky toys and ropes/toys where you or another playful dog can play tug with me are my favorites. The fenced yard will allow me freedom to run, sniff and play without restriction and help build my self-confidence. Walks are good, but not enough exercise for me. When I get tired of playing outside and listening to the birds and neighborhood sounds, I go to the back door to come back in the house.\n \nMy foster mom likes it when I want to be pet because I literally back up and sit on her foot. I have just started giving her kisses while she pets me. I am learning house manners very fast now that I am comfortable in my foster home. No house accidents for over a month and I keep my crate clean when mom has to leave the house. My foster mom has started giving me Kongs with frozen peanut butter and those things are the bomb!  I am microchipped, spayed and up to date on shots. I would love to have my own home. Please contact Speak if you are ready for a fun and energetic girl.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please review our adoption policies and apply online at [www.speakfortheunspoken.com/adopt](http://www.speakfortheunspoken.com/adopt).\n\nVisit [www.speakfortheunspoken.com](http://www.speakfortheunspoken.com/) will give you more information about our rescue.\n\n***PLEASE READ*** WE DO NOT RESPOND TO PETFINDER OR EMAIL INQUIRIES.

If you are interested in meeting this pet, please email information about yourself, family, residence and current/prior pet experience. If it is a good fit you will be sent an application. Once that is approved, arrangements will be made for a meeting. Thanks for your understanding!\n\nCookie is an approximately 1 year old female Lab, possibly hound? mix. She was rescued from a Kentucky shelter when her time was up. Unfortunately for Cookie she is very scared and shy. She is trying really hard to trust people and is getting lots of extra love and attention by staying up in the treatment kennels with our technicians always near by with peanut butter and toys. Cookie likely was not socialized properly as a puppy and subsequently acts fairly wild and skittish, almost feral. She is a sweet dog and will thrive with the right, patient owner. We recommend no children, as she is easily scared, but she has not been at all snappy or growly even when terrified coming off of the transport van. She is getting used to collars/leashes as these are all new scary things to her. A martingale type collar will be required to bring Cookie home at time of adoption to ensure she makes it home safely. If you think you can be the patient and loving forever family that Cookie needs, please email us. Her adoption fee is $199 and includes her spay, microchip, vaccinations and routine labwork.\n\n\n\nEmail inquires can be directed to availablepets@gmail.com\nAdoption donations for adult dogs range from $59 to $299 and puppies from $159 to $599. This includes: \n-  Spay or neuter surgery\nVaccines current to the date of adoption*: \n  -  Rabies vaccine\n  -  Bordatella vaccine\n  -  Booster for canine Distemper, Adenovirus type 1 & 2, Leptospirosis,\n      Parainfluenza, Parvovirus, and Coronavirus (DHLPPC)\n  - Canine Influenza vaccine\n-  Fecal test\n-  1st worming \n-  Heartworm test (+6 months old) \n-  Capstar flea treatment\n-  Microchip identification implant\n* Boosters required for puppies and kittens (depending on age) POST adoption are the responsibility of the pet owner.\n \nHeartworm prevention must also be purchased at the time of adoption and prices vary depending on the size of the animal being adopted.  Puppies under 6 months old are required to sign up for a puppy obedience class. ($89 deposit required, refundable upon completion)\n\nCome Ready to Adopt: \nIf you rent or live in a condo/townhouse with an association, bring your lease/bylaws indicating pets are allowed and if there are any restrictions. We require vaccinations and tests to be up to date for the protection of your current pets. Bringing their vet records can help speed the adoption process. All adults in the household must be present and co-sign the application.",

If you are interested in meeting this pet, please email information about yourself, family, residence and current/prior pet experience. If it is a good fit you will be sent an application. Once that is approved, arrangements will be made for a meeting. Thanks for your understanding!\n\nOnyx is a sweet and well mannered boy, about 5 years old,  who we originally rescued from a Kentucky shelter when his time was up. We placed him with an owner who surrendered him back to us after 5 months of having Onyx. His only complaint was that he snapped at another dog once over food. Due to this information (and lack of any additional details), Onyx should be placed as an only dog or with a family willing to separate during feeding time, etc. Onyx is a quiet, sweet and low key dog who would love to get out of the kennel and back into a home. Onyx is a model citizen here... keeps a clean kennel and does not even bark when we walk in and out for let outs, etc. He stands calmly at the kennel door waiting to go outside or get attention. His adoption fee is $159 and includes his neuter, microchip, vaccinations and routine labwork. He was heartworm positive when we first acquired him from the sending shelter but has finished his treatment with us and will be ready to be retested soon. Please email us if you are interested in this handsome boy.\n\nRescue\nHelp Save Pets - Oswego\nContact Info\nRescue\nHelp Save Pets - Oswego\nContact\nEmail\navailablepets@gmail.com\nAddress\n1280 Route 34, at the corner of Route 34 and Ogden Falls Dr., Oswego, IL 60543\nPet ID\nPhone\nWebsite\nhttp://www.helpsavepets.org\nDonation\nDonate to This Rescue\nTheir Adoption Process\n1.

Meet the Pet\nAdditional Adoption Info\nAdoption Requirements\n\n\u2022 Must be 21 years of age or older to adopt a cat, 23 years of age or older to adopt a dog.\n\n\u2022 Must provide a copy of your lease agreement or association by laws if you live in an apartment, condo or townhouse\n\n\u2022 Must provide documents/receipts that specify your cat or dog\u2019s immunizations/required tests are current (rabies, distemper and fecal (+ for dogs- heartworm test and bordetella if adopting a dog) (+ for cats - leukemia test/vaccine if adopting a cat)). We can call your veterinarian to get this information, if you don\u2019t have the documents. If you know they are not current, bring the animals with you and can have them updated by the animal hospital that houses HSP.\n\n\u2022 All adults in the household must be present and co sign the adoption agreement.\n\n\u2022 All your currently owned dogs/cats must be spayed or neutered. This is a non-negotiable requirement.\n\n\u2022 Heartworm prevention for dogs must also be purchased at the time of adoption and prices vary depending on the size of the animal being adopted.\n\n\u2022 Puppies under 6 months old are required to sign up for a puppy obedience class. ($89 deposit required, refundable upon completion)\n\nEach Adoption Includes:\n\u2022 Spay or neuter surgery\nVaccines current to the date of adoption *:\n\u2022 Rabies vaccine\n\u2022 Bordatella vaccine for dogs\n\u2022 Canine Influenza vaccine for dogs\n\u2022 Booster for canine and feline distemper and several other dangerous diseases\n\u2022 Fecal test\n\u2022 1st deworming\n\u2022 Heartworm test (dogs +6 months old)\n\u2022 Leukemia test for cats\n\u2022 Capstar flea treatment\n\u2022 Microchip identification implant\n* Boosters required for puppies and kittens (depending on age) POST adoption are the responsibility of the pet owner.\n\nApplication Process\n\nOnce you have decided on an animal, you will be provided with an Adoption Questionnaire which requires name, address, phone numbers and asks some questions about your household, why you want a pet and how you plan to care for it. The Adoption Questionnaire needs to be approved by an authorized humane society volunteer. If an authorized volunteer is on site, that occurs quickly and if you\u2019ve provided all required information on applicable lease agreements/association by laws and current immunizations/tests for any existing pets, you may be able to take your new friend home immediately. If an authorized volunteer is not on site, you\u2019ll receive a phone call when the status is determined.\n\nAdoption Donations\n\nAdoption donations for adult dogs range from $59 to $399 and puppies from $159 to $599.\nAdoption donations for adult cats range from $29 to $99 and kittens from $59 to $399.\n\nWe are a private pet rescue and are not affiliated with any government or national organization, and as such our adoption donations are set to cover as much of the cost for the spay/neuter surgery, vaccinations, tests and medical care of our animals that is realistic. We lose money on every animal we take in as our adoption donations are less than what caring for the animals actually costs us. We ask more for puppies, kittens and purebred adults to help cover the expenses of the older mixed breed animals for which we receive minimal donations and incur significant debt. However, even at our highest prices, puppies and kittens are still half the price of pet store animals AND our animals are already altered and up to date on vaccinations.\n\nPost Adoption Care\n\nIf you choose to give one of our deserving homeless animals a second chance at a good life, a New Pet Health Assurance Program provided by our partner veterinary clinics is available. This will cover the cost of treating shelter related illnesses should one occur, for 60 days after your adoption date up to $500. If you do not purchase this coverage, you would assume total financial responsibility for any needed medical treatment immediately after you adopt.\n\n\nSince 2000, we have placed over 10,000 animals into loving homes. Each one of these animals was given shelter, food, medical aid and vaccinations and time to find the right home. Our doctors mended mutilated limbs and cured many illnesses so that these animals could get a second chance at good lives. We have grown and now operate out of 4 locations, not all of them in Plainfield. In 2008 we changed our name from the Humane Society of Plainfield to Help Save Pets, still HSP.\n\nWhat exactly does HSP do?\nWe rescue desirable and healthy adult dogs and cats from pounds and shelters in mostly rural areas.\n\n\u2022 Many government funded pounds and shelters, especially in rural areas, have an abundance of homeless animals and scarce cage space to house them. The demand for pets from these shelters is low and the kill rate is high.\n\nWe rescue puppies and kittens that most rescues will not.\n\u2022 Many shelters, including other no kill rescues, will NOT take puppies or kittens under 3 months old because of their susceptibility to illness. Most are sadly put to death.\n\nWe rescue dogs and cats with curable health problems.\n\u2022 Many adult animals with curable health problems (some serious, including Heartworm positive dogs) are restored to health and offered for adoption.\n\nWe take pregnant and nursing moms with their babies.\n\u2022 We find foster homes for them to raise their young in a safe environment. Pounds put these moms and their babies down immediately because of the risk of illness, extra work and additional space involved with caring for them.\n\nWe work closely with Will County and Joliet Township Animal Control to help reduce the kill rate of animals locally.\n\nWe sponsor an Illinois Dept of Agriculture Humane Investigator, who serves our geographic area and investigates cruelty complaints.\n\nWe offer training and behavioral counseling to assist in the transition of adopted animals into new homes.\n\nGo Meet Their Pets\nYou can meet this pet at the OSWEGO ANIMAL HOSPITAL 1280 Route 34 at the corner of Rt 34 and Ogden Falls Dr. (in front of LA Fitness) in Oswego IL\n\n\nAt the Oswego Animal Hospital, animals can be viewed Mon - Fri from 10 am to 7 pm, Saturday and Sunday 10 am to 2 pm. No appointment is needed. For up to the minute availability information on this pet during the hours shown above, call 630-554-7670.\n\nEmail inquires can be directed to availablepets@gmail.com\n\nMore About This Rescue\nHelp Save Pets is a humane society that has locations in Channahon, Downers Grove, Hinsdale, Oswego, and Shorewood, IL and Gahanna, OH\n\nOther Pets at This Rescue\nView All 9 Pets\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail inquires can be directed to availablepets@gmail.com\nAdoption donations for adult dogs range from $59 to $299 and puppies from $159 to $599.

            "description": "Before you inquire about Zarah, please read her bio as she will require a person who has the experience and knowledge working with strong willed large breeds. Only local inquiries (within 30 miles of Sacramento/Roseville) will be considered as she will require multiple meets before adoption. No cats, no apartments.\n\nZarah is a beautiful Doberman/Malinois mix, about 6 1/2 months old (DOB ~7/3/20) and currently weighs 58 lbs. She loves very much to be with her person, but that person needs to understand that she needs structure and boundaries.  She needs an experienced person who is consistent, calm and assertive.  She walks great on a leash, loves to go for walks and is good in the car. She needs a person with an active lifestyle, someone who goes for daily walks, or likes to hike, is dedicated and has the time to continue socializing her the correct way. She is good with the dogs she currently lives with, but needs to be introduced to new dogs in the correct manner.  Once introduce correctly, she loves to play, but is definitely not a dog park dog.  She knows basic commands and is eager to learn. She is very attentive when learning new things and is very smart.  She is being introduced to new environments and has been good, but as with other introductions it needs to be done correctly.  Once she meets new people, she is is very loving. She is great in the house and is crate trained. She would do well with another well behaved mellow confident dog. A home with no children or dog savvy kids over the age of 12 will only be considered. If you have Doberman/Shepherd or other large working breed experience and are a committed owner, this dog may be for you.\n\nPlease email right away if you would like to learn more about this dog......and visit our website www.siarescuers.org to learn more about our rescue group.   Adoption fees range from $200-$400 for dogs.  THE DOGS SHOWN ON THE SITE ARE IN FOSTERCARE - WE DO NOT HAVE A SHELTER TO VISIT.  EMAIL is the best way to reach us.We are a volunteer run, very small organization - so please be patient when waiting for a response, but feel free to check back in if you haven't heard from us in a day or so - thank you so much for considering a rescued pooch!",

Which means the disease has taken over the optic nerve and caused him to lose his eyesight. Sadly there is no cure, only management and his estimated life expectancy is two years. He has been started on Pred and cytosar infusion treatments to keep the disease under control, and potentially bring back some of his eyesight. He is only a baby, under 2yrs of age. WE ARE COMMITTED to him and will over all costs of his treatments so you must be in the Ft Lauderdale area.\nIf you are interested in adopting Mario please email 100plusabandoneddogs@gmail.com.\n\n",

With a medium-mild energy level, Amos is enjoys going for walks and outings but is also perfectly content spending the day lounging around the house with the fam. Amos is housebroken, knows \"sit\" and \"down\", comes when called, and rarely barks.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, setting up a meet-n-greet, or getting more information on Amos, please fill out our adoption application!",

He is both dog and cat friendly and sleeps quietly in his crate at night. Rhett\u2019s foster family doesn\u2019t believe he has ever lived in a home before or had a family to call his own. He has been very well behaved, but Rhett is still learning about all the new luxuries he has now such as toys, yummy treats, and ear rubs from humans. Rhett would benefit from a family who will be patient with him as he learns all the nuances of living in a home. He would really like a fenced in yard so he can roam and play in the snow and a doggie friend to play with and learn from. If you think Rhett might be your family\u2019s perfect match, please apply to adopt at mapawsmepetrescue.com \n\nInterested in meeting Rhett? \n\nAll Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue dogs are in homes with foster families; we do not have a shelter where dogs are available for daily viewing.\n\nOur process is as follows:\n1.  Review our policies and adoption radius  on our website: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n2.  Submit an application for review and approval;\n3.  MPM Rescue reviews application and checks vet records and references;\n4.  MPM foster contacts approved applicant(s) to arrange a home check and meeting with available dog(s);\n5.   If there is a good fit, adoption is completed with a contract and fees (payable via check or cash).\n\nThe adoption fee is listed here: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n\nDogs from Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue come with the following medical care already provided:\n- Spay/Neuter surgery\n- Age appropriate vaccinations\n- Heartworm test (for dogs over 6mo) and treatment if positive\n- Microchip\n- Deworming\n- Heartworm and Flea/Tick Preventative\n- Any other necessary medical treatment as recommended by veterinarian\n\n*Please note that the identified breed(s) are best guesses. We very rarely have information on our dogs' actual breeds since they often come to the shelters we work with as strays.*",

I am looking for a quiet home where I can give and get lots of love in a calm environment. You see, I haven\u2019t been treated very well in the past, and my body tells the story of those tough times. Thank goodness I don\u2019t have to worry about any of that ever again! \n\nHumans have not always been kind to me and shown me love, so I\u2019d do best in a special home where we can make up for lost times together. Are you patient, gentle, and kind? Will you guide me in learning new things? Do you like to cuddle and relax, but also play and go on walks? We might be awesome for each other! I might be able to live with the right dog sibling that is laid back and can gently show me the ropes. No small furry animals for me, sorry! \n\nIf a dog is still listed on Petfinder, we are still accepting applications. Please visit www.bulliedbreedsrescue.org for adoption policies and adoption application. The adoption application is the first step to be considered.\n\nAll dogs are up to date on vaccines, heartworm tested, microchipped and spayed/neutered prior to adoption.",

            "description": "Joey was rescued from a slaughterhouse in China and is looking for his forever home. This handsome Labrador Retriever weighs 72 lbs. and is three years old. Joey\u2019s foster family is very proud of how quickly he\u2019s acclimated to home life and they enjoy how curious Joey is about everything. He loves to play fetch, chew on toys, and chase a large soccer sized ball around the yard; if he finds a large rock on his walk he\u2019ll use his nose and front paws to toss it around \u2013 this is likely something he did to entertain himself when he was in China. Joey sleeps soundly through the night in his crate and loves to have his face massaged; he\u2019s yet to show any indication that he wants a belly rub. Joey walks very well on the leash but if he finds a rock or food/trash, he will pull towards it. Joey knows the word \u201ctreat\u201d and his favorite time of the day is breakfast, lunch, and dinner \u2013 he arrived underweight so his foster family is working on helping him gain some much-needed pounds. Joey is working on his house manners and his foster family reports his counter surfing has diminished a great deal in a short time. Joey is a big dog, but he has a soft mouth and takes treats gently. Joey loves to go for car rides and rides very well in the car. Joey needs lots of attention, he requires a bunch of activities to stimulate his mind, an active adopter who can spend time playing with him, and someone with the patience to continue to help him adjust to being a family dog inside the house. His ideal home will also need someone who is dog savvy and committed to continuing to set him up for success by doing things like keeping all food off the kitchen counter and using positive reinforcement to teach Joey the ways of the world.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting from us, please complete an adoption application at our website (www.fetchinretrieversrescue.org). Once your application is received, it will be reviewed and you may be contacted to arrange a home visit. In keeping with our adoption process, there are no meet and greets with a dog until all steps in the application process have been completed and a potential match has been made. We adhere to this policy because we strive to ensure adoption success between dogs and their new family.",

After beating mange, heartworms, and cancer, he has received a clean bill of health is ready to live the rest of his life with his furever family! He is doing great at his foster home. Although he's shown a little food and toy aggression with the other dogs,  it can likely be managed with some structure, routine and training. He's a submissive boy, does well with the adults and kids in his foster family, and walks well on leash. \n\nIf you are interested in pursuing an adoption and you live in Texas , please complete the application (links provided below). The process includes a vet check, calling references and doing a home visit. \n\nhttp://www.texassleddogrescue.org/web_documents/tsdr_application.pdf\nor\nhttps://www.formstack.com/forms/?1632205-WX2Zb144ZP\n\nPlease note the following:\nWe rarely do out of state adoptions.  (Exceptions can be discussed but will be based on previous big dog experience and will require same adoption process.)\nChildren in the home or that visit often must be at least 6 years of age. (Exceptions can be discussed but will be based on previous big dog experience.)\nAdoption donation is due at the time of adoption.  Puppies under 1 year are $300. Dogs 1 year to 7 years are $200 and dogs over 7 years are $150.  As this is a donation, it will be non-returnable if dog is returned to rescue.\nDogs are not placed on a \"first come, first serve\" basis but rather the best home for the dog. \nAll dogs placed by TSDR will be:\nspayed/neutered\nvaccinated for distemper/parvo, rabies, and bordetella\nheartworm tested and treated if needed\nmicrochipped\nother vetting as deemed needed\nNew owners will receive copies of all available vet information and must agree to keep them current on all of the above.",

Visit our FAQ webpage for commonly asked questions about our adoption/foster process.\nBuster says, \"Any dog is a lap dog, as long as he sits on your lap!\" He's big, but he sure does love to snuggle, and his silky soft fur will make you want to pet him all day. Buster is 8 years old which is the perfect age; he's low maintenance and happy to be lazy around the house, but also appreciates a good walk and is ready to play when you are. Buster does have some anxiety, but is easily comforted with love and treats. He will do best in a home with no small children or other pets. Buster already knows a few tricks, but he could benefit from some additional obedience training, and needs to work on his leash manners. Buster already has his own bed, harness, leash, toys, Kong's, and anything else a dog could need, so all you have to provide is a loving home!Last Day Dog Rescue now microchips all animals before adoption. Microchips are implanted between the animals shoulder blades and are a permanent form of identification. The microchips are registered to Last Day Dog Rescue with the adopter's info added once adopted. If the animal is ever lost and slips his/her collar/tags the microchip allows the finder to know who to contact if scanned for a microchip. Animals MUST still have a collar with tags on at all times. Per our contract, we take all our animals back if for any reason you can't keep your adopted animal.\n\nPlease understand the statements about this animal are based upon the foster home's evaluation of the animal. The animal might behave differently (negatively or positively) in your home. While the animal might be good with the current foster's dogs, cats, children, etc., it may not be with your animal(s) or children. The animal may be housebroken or litter trained in the home of the foster but may relapse in your home. The animal is represented to the public as it performs in the foster home and any statements made regarding the animal are conditional to that foster home setting. Please understand that statements made regarding this animal are simply overviews and are not guaranteed.\n\nThe Petfinder.com system requires that we choose a predominant breed or breed mix for our animals. Visual breed identification in animals is unreliable so for most of the animals we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each animal as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our animals based on personality, not by breed label.\n\nThank you for looking through our list of animals needing forever homes and choosing rescue first. We appreciate you stopping by.\n2/1/21 3:28 PM",

I'm still getting a bit used to it, so I like to lean on a human for support, but I'll get there soon. I still love walks and being with people. I get along well with my pal Batman, who was a stray with me. I really love to be petted and loved on. Be my special person! Contact Natchitocheshopeforpaws@yahoo.com.",

This poor guy was left tied to a dumpster like a piece of garbage. No food, no shelter, no way to save himself and just a puppy at 6 months old. That was the life Rocky lived and we can't change where he has been. But we can certainly change where Rocky is going, and that is straight on to happiness in a loving, forever home. If you can give this sweet boy the fantastic home he deserves, where he will never be a victim of cruelty again, and he will never be homeless because forever means forever, please apply online to adopt Rocky (TX) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

They moved from a home with a yard to an apartment and wanted better for Colby Jack.\n\nHe loves long walks, is housebroken. Colby Jack would be best in a home with a yard, as he is a big boy weighing in at approximately 60 pounds. He loves to be around his loved ones and will even chill with you on the couch if allowed.\n\nThis guy is non-reactive to other dogs, so we think he'd do well with a proper introduction. He has been through some training, as well.\n\nSo if you're looking for some fine cheese, Colby Jack is your guy! So if you'd like to meet him,\n\nplease submit a completed\nadoption application found\nat www.doggiebonez.com so that we can schedule a meet and greet. He is also on all of our social media pages IG: @Doggie_Bonez_Inc_ and Facebook: Doggie Bonez.\n\nIf adoption isn't an option, please consider fostering one of our pups. We are a volunteer-run non-profit dog rescue and always welcome new short or long-term doggie foster families. We much appreciate the help and time of our fosters. You provide all the love, comfort, and safety of a home, and we supply you with everything else you may need, dog food, dog bed, toys, medical attention (if required), etc. If you are interested, please visit www.doggiebonez.com to see all of our available dogs who need a foster family while waiting for their fur-ever home and complete the foster application.",

She has a gorgeous black coat and soulful eyes.  She weighs 65 lbs.  \n\n\u2022 Beauty is a real sweetheart!  She\u2019s pretty calm and well mannered. She likes to give hugs.\n\n\u2022 Beauty lives in a  foster home with other dogs and does well with them all.  If you have a dog we\u2019d ask you to bring your dog in to meet Beauty to see if they could be buddies.\n\n\u2022 She likes toys\u2026and will take them from her doggie friends. Any dog in the home would need to be passive about her stealing their toys. \n\n\u2022 Beauty loves being with her foster parents. She loves napping and spending time indoors with the family much more than outdoors in the yard.\n\n\u2022 We think Beauty would be okay with older kids.\n\n\u2022 She\u2019s not a big barker, but she barks enough that we think she would not be a good match for apartment or townhouse living.  She has a loud deep bark.\n\n\u2022 She rides nicely in the car and has pretty good leash manners on walks.  \n\n\u2022 Her foster parents say she lets them wipe her feet when they get muddy or snowy\u2026. good to know in this wintry weather! \n \n\u2022 She is house trained and crate trained.  \n\n\u2022 Beauty has been spayed, vaccinated, microchipped and tested for heartworms.  She was a stray.  She\u2019s a sweetie! \n\nMORE ON ADOPTING OUR DOGS... \n\n> COVID-19 UPDATE:  PLEASE SUBMIT AN ONLINE ADOPTION APPLICATION AND A MEMBER OF OUR ADOPTIONS TEAM WILL REACH OUT TO YOU.  Please visit our web site at HSGKC.ORG for an adoption application, our current COVID-19 adoption protocol, and other adoption info.\u00a0\n\n> If you decide you'd like to adopt one of the pets you meet, we reserve the pet for you but we generally don't send the pet home with you that day. We\u2019ll instead schedule a pick up date and time that\u2019s convenient for you.\u00a0  \n\n> Our goal is to send you home with a healthy pet and any information and support you may need to help your new pet adjust to his or her new home.  All of our dogs & puppies have been spayed or neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, treated for fleas & ticks, tested for heartworms (7 mo. and over), and are on monthly heartworm preventative. Puppies who are too young to receive all the necessary puppy boosters and/or first rabies shot may be brought back to us for those vaccines at no extra charge. You will also receive a leash, collar, coupons for pet supplies and services, toys, and educational materials. And we'll give your dog a bath before he or she goes home! \n\n> Please note that we prefer and may require a fenced yard for many of our dogs.  Exceptions are made on an individual basis depending on the dog's needs, the person's dog experience, the dog's and person's activity levels, home environment and other factors. \n\nThank you for searching for a shelter pet!\n\nDog Adoption Contact Info:\nEmail: christine@hsgkc.org\nPhone: 913.521.2339\nhsgkc.org",

She is currently in foster care and doing great on leash walking and experiencing new things. Mia loves to play with other dogs. Mia will most likely always be a little shy.  She is looking for a family who has another canine that will play with her and show her the ropes.  She will need a fenced in yard and a patient and loving person.  \n\nMia is 6 months old and weighs about 30 pounds.\n\nAdoption fee is $225 and includes: spay/neuter, parvo/distemper series of shots, rabies (if dog is old enough), bordetella, heartworm preventative while here, worming, and microchip. \n\nIf you are interested in meeting and/or adopting one of our dogs, please visit our website and fill out an application: www.northmeckanimalrescue.org",

Nolan is the whole package as besides his good looks, he is a big baby, is super friendly and loves to smile! Nolan is so fabulous, in fact, that he even likes cats!

My adoption fee is $350, Houston area\n(Available for transport $550, includes adoption fee, health certificate, and transportation)\n. I am neutered, microchipped, and tested heartworm negative. Fill out an app at www.soca-fbc.org under the adoptable tab.\n\nMcKee is a sweet boy who is more of a lapdog than not. He is shy. I haven't seen him play with toys, and he has only initiated playing chase once with the resident dogs. He would probably do best being an only dog or with older dogs such as himself. He doesn't like aggressive dogs getting in his face as he will snap at them. I think he would do best in a home with only adults and/or older considerate kids. He likes to curl up on the couch on a blanket by himself. He is not housebroken but is working on it. He is able and willing to jump up on furniture including beds and the kitchen table. He has been an outside dog so being in a home and being treated as a family member is new to him. He needs to taught manners by an understanding adult in a gentle manner. He needs to be in a quiet spot to eat as he is distracted easily. He loves human attention. He likes to sleep in bed with his humans. He is so tiny, just 9 lbs. so appears to be younger than his 9 years. Could your open your heart and home to this sweet boy?",

He requires an experienced owner as Baxter is big boy with big energy still working on impulse control (can be mouthy and likes to pull on leash) so a home without small children is ideal for him. He is house broken, affectionate, smart (knows basic commands) and fun. He keeps his fosters entertained and laughing daily. \n\nCrate training, Baxter doesn't like to see his humans leave so he is crated when no one is in the house so that he doesn't get into mischief. \n\nYou can view videos of Baxter on Facebook, Instagram and YouTube @hopefulheartsrescue",

He is about a year old, weighs 45 pounds, and has a shorthaired blue merle coat and full tail.  This smart guy is housebroken, crate-trained and he knows his basic obedience commands.  Comet is very good on leash and absolutely loves to go for rides in the car.\nComet is reserved when he first meets new people, but once he gets to know you he is your high-Velcro best friend.  Comet loves to be with people, and he loves playing ball, Frisbee and tug.  He also loves other dogs \u2013 he is playful and even silly with them!  Chase is his favorite game with other dogs.  He is an active, fun-loving guy, but he does have a slight hip dysplasia, and if he plays hard you will see a slight limp in his right rear leg.  The vets who have examined Comet say that no treatment is required other than some joint supplements, and he even though he will play ball 24/7 if he could, he is a dog who should be limited to normal, backyard ball games \u2013 no serious competitive sports for him.  Comet is cat-friendly, and he even gives them a play-bow to try and get them to play with him!\nThe ideal home for Comet is full of fun, topped with a healthy serving of love!  He is all about love, play, and being part of the family 24/7.  A fenced yard is important and another playful dog or two would be perfect.  Children 10 and over, and cats, are welcome!  Comet is such a happy guy and he will bring such joy to his new family, maybe yours?  Apply today!  Comet is fostered in Kingsport, TN.\n",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Winston and I LOVE to smile. As a matter of fact, I'm pretty sure I don't know how to stop smiling. Even when I was in that scary, crowded Texas shelter, I was always putting my best face forward in hopes someone would notice me. Boy, was I lucky when the people at Dolly's Legacy saw me and chose me to come to their rescue! That REALLY gave me a reason to smile! Some interesting facts about me....would you believe I was born with an all black coat? Yep, it's true. I used to be a black dog. Now I'm this combination of gold & white, which just makes me look like a white dog who got dipped into a pot of gold. I have a condition called vitiligo which causes my skin to lose it's pigment. Don't worry, it doesn't hurt and I don't even notice until I look in the mirror (gosh, I am handsome!).\u00a0 Another thing about me, I love to run & play so I really want a big yard where I can be off leash and frolic to my heart's content. I spent way too long cooped up in a shelter so I'm all about relishing in the moment now with my newfound freedom. Sometimes I'm picky about which dogs I want to be my friends, and I most certainly don't want to make friends with any cats. They have scary claws, so I will take a hard pass on living with one of those creatures. I'm a BIG guy, packing a hefty 95 lbs, and I play hard, so little kids probably aren't the best idea even though I love them. I don't want to knock them down in my zest for fun & games. I was a long-termer at the shelter, but the staff loved me so much, they refused to send me to a rainbow bridge and instead kept me until rescue found me. I'm super happy about that, because I love every minute of being a rescue dog! Winston is a Lab/mix, weighs 95 lbs and was born approximately 10-28-14. He is neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, tested negative for heartworm disease. Adoption fee is $375 to help offset the many expenses we have for vetting costs. We rely strictly on adoption fees and donations to continue to save the lives of orphaned & abandoned pets; 100% goes towards their care. If interested in adopting one of our available dogs or puppies, please complete an online adoption application at https://dollyslegacyanimalrescue.org/adopt/\u00a0You will be contacted by our adoption coordinator via email after your application has been reviewed & approved to schedule an appointment.",

She is very playful and just wants to explore. She seems to be mostly blind but does not let that spoil her fun. She is smart and figured out the floorplan of our house fairly quickly, plus she follows voices and claps. Honestly she would probably be great in almost any kind of household! She is completely fine with both our cats and dog and does not really react to their shenanigans. She also warms up to people very quickly. She loves to be petted and snuggled with. Overall she is just a super happy girl! She is probably about 10 years old and lived outside most of her life.

I am quick to learn new skills and am responsive to training. Ive experienced only love and affection so Im looking for positive and gentle environment with my new family to teach me the social skills Ill need for a happy life.\n\nThe senior couple who rescued me at 3 months love me but need to focus on their own health and want me to be more active and learn skills with other young ones! They say I am calm and sensitive for my young age. They feed me plenty of bone-building food as Im growing so fast. I especially love playing ball and love being outside in the yard! Im looking for a home with another dog, preferably male, or a family with children as I would like to interact with others! I dont think I would be a good companion for extreme sports but would love a home or property with things to learn and a dog friend who wants to play and explore. Although I[m a growing pup I seem to be favoring one hip over the other, so I'm getting an xray Feb. 1st to make sure all systems are go. I've never been introduced to a cat, but with some training I'm pretty sure we'd get along. Can I join your family? I'm current on vacciantions, heartworm negative, microchipped and will be spayed soon. Miniumum adoption donation: $350.00\n\nPlease visit our website at edcgsr.com to fill out an application for Kady or copy and paste the link below. Once we receive your application and it has been vetted, a volunteer will contact you. Thank you.\n\nhttps://petstablished.com/adoptions/personal-information?application_type=Adopt&pet_id=943519",

I wish I could tell you what happened to me, but what I can tell you is that it hasn't made me any less of a sweetheart!  My fur is all patchy because of a skin condition, but the doctors tell me that it's not contagious.  I have a trick knee, so I don't like to go on long walks (and I really don't like that \"snow\" stuff).  I'm also undergoing heartworm treatment so I need to stay calm - but that's not hard for me because I'm a very relaxed guy.  I'm really thankful for the love and help I've gotten from my friends here at Buddy, I know that what I really need is a forever home.  Please contact The Buddy Foundation and come and meet me!\n\nNo Pets in the household and no small children.",

            "description": "Hi, my name is Nikia. I am around 5 months old and about 25 pounds. I am loving my new foster home. I am originally from Alabama and have been living with my Minnesota foster family since I arrived. We are having so much fun!\n\nMy favorite pastimes are playing fetch with my foster mom and hanging out with my foster siblings. Because I'm still a puppy, I can be a little overbearing for them as they are much smaller than me, but I would love a dog my size to play with! I do well in my kennel when my foster mom is busy or running errands and I seep in it at night. I do not mind my kennel, but I also like running around the house, playing with my toys and getting into mischief. My foster mom says I am a very busy puppy and need lots of attention until I get a little bit bigger. I like going on long walks but sometimes I am afraid to leave the yard because those big noisy cars scare me. I do well with my doing my pottying outside as long as I am kept on a schedule. The more consistent your with letting me out, the more successful I will be!\n\nIf you are looking for a very sweet and playful puppy, I am the one for you! Although I love my foster home, I am looking forward to meeting new humans and find my furever family soon. Maybe I can come home with you?\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nAll our Warrior Dogs will have all age appropriate medical care and vaccines, a microchip, and spay/neuter before adoption unless age is a factor with a puppy younger than 6-12 months at the time of adoption. If that is the case, the spay/neuter will be covered in the adoption fee and the owner will be responsible to have the procedure completed at a Warrior Dog Rescue Veterinarian at the appropriate time.\n\nPlease note that the majority of our dogs in rescue are from shelters where they have been found as strays or abandoned. Their breed description is based on our very best educated guess based on physical characteristics and their dispositions. If they came to our rescue as an owner surrender, the breed description will be listed as provided by the previous owner.\n\nAdoption Fee - $525\n\nTo apply for this pup, please submit an Adoption Application at http://warriordogrescue.com/adopt/adoption-application/",

She was found abandoned in the notorious dog dumping grounds of Bakersfield with ropes tied around her body. Despite being treated that way, she could not be sweeter. She loves cuddling with people, playing with toys, and chewing Nyla-Bones. She is doing well with her pottie training, is great on a leash and loves car rides. She gets along well with smaller dogs but can be dog selective with larger breeds (so proper introductions will be needed). Her very best friend is a special needs pup who weighs about seven pounds. Mazie LOVES people and would probably do best in a home where someone is home most of the time. Mazie is spayed, received a dental, up to date on vaccinations and is microchipped. If interested in meeting or adopting Mazie, please go to www.LOLR.org and fill out an adoption application.",

Lucci knows basic commands, appears to be housebroken and walks on a leash well. She would do well with another dog her size or bigger, or she would also do well as an only dog. \n\nIf you would like to adopt a dog from Rescue Row please fill out an application at https://form.jotform.com/91767055990166 \n\n*Please check your junk email folder if you do not receive a response from a Rescue Row member within 48 hours.\n\n*You must live within an hour of the DFW Metroplex because we do trial adoptions and require a homecheck\n\n*Our adoption fees are as follows (paid by cash or a check made out to Rescue Row):\n\n Dogs 12 weeks-6 months old: $300 adoption fee\n\n Dogs 7 months and older: $275 adoption fee\n\nRescue Row is a 501(c)3 (non-profit) all volunteer dog rescue organization serving the DFW Metroplex. We are dedicated to rescuing dogs in shelters, dogs in abusive or neglectful situations, and dogs surrendered by their owners because of difficult circumstances. We place dogs in loving, responsible, committed permanent homes, following a comprehensive adoption process, which includes taking considerable care in finding good matches and educating prospective adopters about the responsibilities and costs of bringing a dog into their homes and lives. Dogs in our care are spayed or neutered, microchipped, receive all appropriate veterinary care and treatment, and placed in nurturing foster homes while they await placement in their permanent homes. We assist dogs in distress without regard to age, breed or ease of placement. Dogs in the greatest need take priority. Finally, we strive to work with shelters and other rescue and humane organizations to develop a network of supporters and volunteers in order to create a better world for homeless dogs.",

            "description": "DOB: 2018 Weight: 16 lbs\n\nMeet Daisy! This girl is currently in a foster home and awaiting her forever home through PCPoundpuppies.She's a 3yr old black chihuahua/rat terrier mix. She currently weighs 16lbs and is spayed and UTD on all shots/vaccines. Daisy LOVES people. She wants to cuddle and be held all the time. Personal space is nonexistent. Once you start giving her belly rubs you're stuck as she'll constantly grab your hand and pull it back. She is friendly with other dogs as well as cats and respectful children. She eats twice a day on schedule perfectly fine alongside her doggie friend. She does fine on a leash and should get frequent exercise for her energy level. She's potty trained but will have an accident here and there, especially if she gets too excited. Daisy gets along with other dogs but will initially start growling (this only lasted a day upon meeting her bigger playmate). The two are now fine and cuddle with each other. Having a fenced in yard and being allowed on furniture would greatly benefit her in her new home. She's really just looking for a cuddle buddy.\n\nShe is currently in a foster home and all meet and greets are with an approved application. Yes, we do call your vet for a reference and we do verify what you put on your application so please be truthful.\nA home with a tall fence (5 ft) is going to be a must for this girl since she enjoys running out the door when it's opened and we want her to be safe.\nHer adoption fee is $150\nApplications can be found on our website pcpoundpuppies.com\nWe offer a 2 week adoption trial and can loan you a crate during that time***YOU MUST FILL OUT AN APPLICATION BEFORE WE DO ANY MEET AND GREETS. QUESTIONS? CONTACT pcpoundpuppies1@gmail.com\nOur adoption fee is $150 which covers a portion of the dog's vetting costs. The adoption process includes the completion of an application followed by an interview.\nClick here to submit an adoption application: https://pcpoundpuppies.webs.com/adoption-application\n***IMPORTANT: Due to the effects of COVID-19, our Sunday adoption events at Pet Food Center have been canceled until further notice. If there is a dog you are interested in meeting, be sure to contact us and we may be able to set up a meet and greet as soon as possible.***\nYou can get in touch with us by email at pcpoundpuppies1@gmail.com or by phone at 812-483-4341 for more information.\nWe respond to inquiries and adoption applications at our earliest opportunity, but please be patient with us as we work full-time jobs and perform this service as volunteers. We do our best to return messages and schedule adoption interviews within a couple of days of receiving your application.\nThe fastest way to get the ball rolling is to complete an adoption application for the dog that caught your eye. Thank you for considering the adoption of a shelter dog!",

            "description": "Skylar has been with us for about two months now, and she continues to be the sweetest dog ever! She has all of the kids in the neighborhood wanting to come up and love on her because she is so non-threatening. Whenever we are out, she will set a course to cut people off, and then sit right in front of them looking for pets. Special people, and I am not sure what makes them special, get the full Skylar treatment, where she rolls over at their feet.\n\nShe does have some separation anxiety. She is doing much better being left, especially if the other pups are home with her. But, she is still a howling, whimpering mess when left totally alone. She sleeps in the crate, and can even be closed in it, when you are home, but she hates it in there if left in it while no one is home. A window perch so she can rest, while she is keeping an eye out for our return, has done wonders for her level of anxiety.\n\nShe is a bit mischievous...she is a little taller and can reach the edges of the kitchen counter. Skylar is very food motivated, and she dances around whenever there is a hint of food in the air. She will climb on chairs, tables, or reach up on counters for food. So care is required for normal food stuffs, as well as something she might think of as food, like granular fertilizer. She doesn\u2019t really chew on things, but she does eat things the things she chews, especially stuffed dog toys.\n\nSkylar still won\u2019t willingly go out our back door onto the deck, which has the steps around the corner. We have to entice her with three pieces of kibble to get her out into the backyard. She will go out the front door, and she has no problem going out when she has visited other homes which have patio doors at grade. And speaking of going out the front door...if care isn\u2019t taken, she will slip out to follow you.\n\nShe does well walking on a leash, and seems more interested in looking than sniffing. Except for when she sees a squirrel, she does not pull. She has about five dog friends on our little walk, and she would like to go up to their front doors every time. Excellent recall. But, a little tug to get her moving again is usually all it takes. So far, she hates wearing any kind of harness and will not leave the front sidewalk until I take it off.\n\nShe ignored the cats she spent a weekend with. All the neighborhood kids love her because she is so gentle and sweet, sitting right in front of them for pets. She loves sleeping on the couch or on her window perch during the day, and on the dog bed in the bedroom at night. She will hop into bed on occasion, and she is not too much of a bed hog.\n\nSkylar is a sweetheart, with a naughty side, so she will keep you on your toes, that\u2019s for sure. But then, the on switch goes off, and the light snoring commences. I think she would be a great fit for someone who wants a low exercise, high snuggle beagle.\n\nSkylar's Webpage - http://beaglemaryland.org/brsm_ms/vIndividualCurrentDog.aspx?dogid=69869\nAdoptable Dog Webpage - http://beaglemaryland.org/brsm_ms/vCurrentDogs.aspx\n\nIf you'd like to adopt one of our beagles:\n*Go to our Website - href=\"http://beaglemaryland.org\n*Review our  Standards for Adoption - http://beaglemaryland.org/Home.aspx?pg=standardsforadoption.htm\n*Fill out an Adopter Profile - \nhttp://brsmbeagles.org/new_site/documents/BRSM_profile_secure.pdf\n and email it to us (or print it off, fill it in and send it via regular mail, if you prefer)\n*A BRSM volunteer will contact you to guide you through the rest of the process!\n\nWe hope to hear from you, and so do the beagles!",

Beacon and his sister Buoy, born 10/17/20, have been being treated for neosporosis, a  diseased passed along from the mom dog.  Beacon's hind legs are stiff, but he can still walk.  We do not know if he will be able to do steps or not.  NO APARTMENTS, FENCED YARD REQUIRED, LIMITED STEPS\n\nPlease visit www.handsheartspaws.org for an adoption application\n\nAll of our dogs are current on vaccinations, spayed/neutered, microchipped, fecal tested, heartworm tested, and they are all on heartworm and flea/tick preventative.\n\nThe adoption process is an application, a vet reference, a home visit, and a lifetime contract. The requested adoption donation for this dog is $400__.\n\nWe do not REQUIRE a fenced in yard (some dogs DO REQUIRE a fence.  Decide what is best for each dog), we do REQUIRE a means of safe outside containment.  We do NOT adopt to homes that use invisible fencing.  Invisible fencing is NOT a safe means of outside containment.\n\nWe are willing to adopt out-of-state, contingent on our ability to complete a home visit, but you must travel to Omaha to complete the adoption. We do not transport or ship our dogs.",

She likes going for walks, hiking, car rides, but enjoys cuddling on the couch the most. She's learning agility now and is having a blast! Georgie is house and crate trained and has great manners-- the perfect addition for anyone wanting to skip those obnoxious puppy years! She doesn't have much experience with other dogs and would probably prefer to be your one and only. She's a sensitive dog and can become scared in some situations (she wants a night light, please!), so she needs a quiet home with teens or adults only.If you are interested in meeting this dog, go to la.bestfriends.org/adopt, fill out our Dog Adoption Survey and our team will reach out to you!",

Amber is a puppy mill rescue that needs a doggie BFF and a patient understanding owner.

She also likes to play with toys and chewing on yak sticks.  She wants to be near her people but isn't a lap dog, and loves a nice cuddly dog bed.  It would be best if someone is home at least most of the day. She can be a barker.  She is house trained and crate trained.  Must have a secure fenced yard.

Due to the pandemic the shelter is adopting dogs to Athens Co. residents only.\n\nIf you have other dogs and/or children at home you must bring them in for a meet and greet to see if they are compatible. \n\nSupport the Athens County Dog Shelter by walking your dog or yourself!  It won't cost you a cent!  Download the app \"Walk For a Dog\" from http://wooftrax.com to your phone and select Athens County Dog Shelter and then take a walk!  It's great for you and your pooches plus it benefits the homeless dogs at the shelter.  Use the app each time you grab the leash.  You, your dog and the shelter will all benefit.\n\nPlease visit  http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/U0RLUOCMT7KI \nto see the wishlist of items that the Shelter is in need of.  Thank You!",

I LIKE TO BARK TO LET YOU KNOW I'M STILL HERE. I WANT A NICE HOME WITH A YARD I CAN PATROL. I WOULD LIKE TO CHASE SQUIRRELS AND MAYBE A FEW CATS JUST TO MAKE SURE THEY KNOW I'M THE BOSS. I LIKE SNACKS, PETS, AND I LIKE TO PROTECT MY OTHER DOG FRIENDS. I MAY BE TINY BUT MY MIGHTY 'TUDE MAKES MY SCARED FRIENDS FEEL SAFE. IF YOU WANT THE CHANCE TO BECOME PART OF MY POSSE FEEL FREE TO FILL OUT AN APPLICATION. IF I LIKE WHAT YOU HAVE TO OFFER I'LL CALL YOU TO ARRANGE A MEET!\n\nhttp://www.wagsandwhiskerspetrescue.com/adopt.html\n\nThank you so much for looking into wags and whiskers for your next family member.\n\nAll of our pets are up to date on vaccinations, microchipped, heartworm tested if over 6 months old and will be spayed or neutered before being allowed to go home.\n\nUnfortunately, we don't always know the background of each dog. Some were dumped, abandoned in an empty house, left tied to a tree, picked up by animal control as strays, or simply unwanted by their owners. We ask that only serious and committed adopters apply as these dogs have suffered enough.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this pet please apply to adopt at\nhttp://www.wagsandwhiskerspetrescue.com/adopt.html\nif the pet is still available for adoption and you are approved to adopt we will contact you to set up a meet and greet appointment.",

She is a little stubborn, although she is crate trained she still wants to be out chilling with her people. Abby has to be the only pet, and no kids. We do not know Abby's past, but we are sure it was not the best. She gets scared easily, she bows down if your voice gets a little loud, moving too quickly she cowards down.  She needs someone who will be patient with her, and let her blossom into the beautiful baby she deserves to be. She has some energy, and just needs room to run so someone with a fenced in yard would be best for her.",

He was surrendered by his owners for being \"aggressive.\" Neither the shelter, nor us, have seen any overt aggression from him. We did get the impression that someone was not very nice to him as he was reactive and hand shy. He also had a lot of medical issues including low thyroid (which likely contributed to the aggression and anxiety), a massively enlarged prostate (ouch!), heartworms, and all the tick borne diseases. We have him on meds for the prostate and the thyroid and he has opened up so much. This kid is super mellow and affectionate, and super dog social.",

My skin was itchy, my ears were achy, and I was a bit...er...crabby towards strangers. But thankfully, the nice folks here realized that between my move from a home, to the pound, to here and then with my skin and ears being ouchy (they made sure I saw a vet and have me feeling much better now), that I just needed a little more time to settle in. Now that I have, I really love people! I know that the volunteers are going to come in for walks, so I wait patiently for my turn and then we go on a walk and I'm told, I walk like a gentleman on leash (or at least I try my hardest). But my all-time favorite is when people come into my kennel and sit down, so I can cover them in kisses and lay my head on their lap for a quick snooze. I really hope someone can see past my dislike for other dogs and will give me a chance, because I really love people and can't wait to be your forever-cuddle-buddy!\n.\n.\nAll animals are current on vaccinations and microchipped prior to adoption. All cats and kittens are Feline Leukemia and FIV tested. All dogs and puppies 6 months and older are heartworm tested. All animals 6 months and older are spayed/neutered prior to adoption. Any kittens/puppies will have refundable spay/neuter deposits included in their adoption fee; spaying/neutering will be the responsibility of the adopter and a refund will be issued upon proof of the surgery being completed by the adopter's veterinarian of choice.\n.\n.\nKitten adoption fees are $150 (includes a $40 refundable spay/neuter deposit). Cat adoption fees are $120, unless otherwise noted. Dog adoption fees may vary between $200-250. Puppies adoption fees may vary between $300-350 (includes a $100 refundable spay/neuter deposit). All adoption fees are taxable (tax is not included in the prices listed above).\n.\n.\n\"\"Sponsored\"\" means that a donor has covered a portion of the adoption fee for that animal. \"\"Fully sponsored\"\" means that a donor has paid the full adoption fee for the animal.",

Maybe it is the family that she just lost?\nShe is a total sweetheart, about 1-2 years old and 60lb. She likes to play with toys and is good with other dogs but she doesn't like cats. She is house trained.\nShe loves people and is really confused about how she ended up at the shelter. Who can help this sweet girl to forget about her past and look forward to the future?\nHer adoption fee is $150 and applications can be found on our website Pcpoundpuppies.com***YOU MUST FILL OUT AN APPLICATION BEFORE WE DO ANY MEET AND GREETS. QUESTIONS? CONTACT pcpoundpuppies1@gmail.com\nOur adoption fee is $150 which covers a portion of the dog's vetting costs. The adoption process includes the completion of an application followed by an interview.\nClick here to submit an adoption application: https://pcpoundpuppies.webs.com/adoption-application\n***IMPORTANT: Due to the effects of COVID-19, our Sunday adoption events at Pet Food Center have been canceled until further notice. If there is a dog you are interested in meeting, be sure to contact us and we may be able to set up a meet and greet as soon as possible.***\nYou can get in touch with us by email at pcpoundpuppies1@gmail.com or by phone at 812-483-4341 for more information.\nWe respond to inquiries and adoption applications at our earliest opportunity, but please be patient with us as we work full-time jobs and perform this service as volunteers. We do our best to return messages and schedule adoption interviews within a couple of days of receiving your application.\nThe fastest way to get the ball rolling is to complete an adoption application for the dog that caught your eye. Thank you for considering the adoption of a shelter dog!",

He would love a hander that is dedicated to working with him as he is NOT a couch potato. A fenced in yard recommend but not required. But we do recommend keeping him on a lead until trained.

            "description": "Grady arrived at Horse Creek Wildlife on October 16, 2020.  \n\nHe is a very sweet and handsome fellow.  He plays great with other dogs and loves spending time with people.  Grady is extremely affectionate and will take all the attention you are willing to give him.\n\nHe is a full-grown Terrier mix and he weighs 28 pounds.\n\nGrady will make a great family pet!  He is anxiously waiting for a family of his very own!\n\nAll of our dogs are spayed or neutered and are current on all vaccinations. They are on monthly heartworm and flea/tick prevention. All of their medical needs are taken care of before they are available for adoption. Our adoption fee is only $100.00. Please complete an application, if you have found a dog you are interested in adopting. You can find our application at www.horsecreekwildlife.org/applic.html. Once completed, you can forward it to adoptions@horsecreekwildlife.org or fax it to 731-926-3000. Kim Austin, our adoption facilitator, will be in contact with you as soon as she has an opportunity to review your application. Understand that she has other duties and she will not ignore any interest shown in adopting one of our dogs. An application will need to be approved before a scheduled time to visit our dogs will be set up.  It may take up to 48 hours before she returns your call or responds to your email, due to work schedules, holidays and adoption events. We do the very best we can for the dogs we have rescued and do not take the adoption process lightly. Please be patient and understand that we will place our rescued dogs in the very best homes possible and reserve the right to refuse applications.",

Stella and her friend Bricks were surrendered by their owner because unfortunately they were no longer able to care for them. This beautiful girl is the biggest sweetheart you will ever meet! She is very outgoing and loves to be with people. She also loves playing with her toys and running around the play yard. Stella is overweight right now but she is ready to work on her girlish figure! She will need exercise in her new home to maintain a healthy weight. According to her former owners, she is great with children. She is also dog friendly, seems to be housebroken and walks well on a leash.\n\nADOPTION HOURS: \n\nWe are currently adopting out animals by appointment only Tuesday through Sunday 1:00 P.M. through 4:00 P.M. with an approved application.

As new people walked in and out, she was curious and engaging. Of course, she also really enjoyed going out for a walk, sniffing and exploring around the shelter. Abbey can be a little shy with strangers, so more exposure to new people and new experiences will help her to become more comfortable and confident.\n\nAbbey should be in a home where she is the only pet, and without small children.\n\n\nAbbey is available for adoption at the Fort Bragg Shelter. Please email Adriana at vegaa@mendocinocounty.org or call 707-961-2491 for more information.\n\nAn adoption application must be filled out before scheduling an appointment.

Bricks and his friend Stella were surrendered by their owner because they were no longer able to care for them. This adorable guy is very lovable and sweet! His prior owner loved and cared for him (evidenced by his sweet  nature and the fact that he is a little overweight right now), but Bricks is committed to working on his goal weight here at the shelter!  What a cutie. Bricks will need exercise in his new home to maintain his figure. He has a little bit of an independent personality, but he loves to receive tons of love and attention. According to his former owners, he is great with children. He also seems to be dog friendly, seems to be housebroken and is working on walking on a leash.\n\nADOPTION HOURS: \n\nWe are currently adopting out animals by appointment only Tuesday through Sunday 1:00 P.M. through 4:00 P.M. with an approved application.

I had no tags and no chip and had not been nuetered. I was limping and had a few long cactus quills stuck in my nose. Ouch! My foster was worried that I'd been hit by a car but the limp was because of that pesskie cactus that I had tangled with. After a trip to the vet I am now all better and am current on all my shots and am nuetered. At first I was very scared of my new home but my foster's dogs have helped me to learn new things like walking on a leash, going in the crate from time to time and commands like sit, stay, off and come.  Since I am a puppy I have alot of energy and I love playing with other dogs. I'm very smart and am also learning the word no when I try doing something I shouldn't. I'm still shy of strangers but we're working on that. I really like watching TV with my foster and my new fun thing to do lately is chewing on ice cubes. I really like the children that come to the house. I'm very loving and hope to go to my forever home soon.\"\n\nPACA is a foster based rescue with no shelter to view our dogs.  We have temporarily stopped all our public adoption events due to COVID-19, however we are still placing dog into loving homes by private appointment with approved applications.  \n\nCompleted applications will be given to the foster to coordinate meetings as everyone feels comfortable.  This application helps us get to know you and your family a little better so we can find the perfect match! Application are found here:\nhttp://nmpaca.org/images/pdf_files/PACA_Adoption_Application.pdf\nPlease email completed applications to pacadogs@aol.com \n\nAll our animals are spayed or neutered, vaccinated, microchipped and tested for tic born illness and heartworm prior to adoption.  Our fee is $175.\n",

He's been at PACC before, so we're hoping this is his last visit to the shelter. This time around, Rex had a few minor injuries, and was a model patient when getting fixed up by the PACC clinic. He definitely has some age related lumps and bumps, but nothing that's slowed him down even a little. This goofball recently got ahold of a soccer ball and frankly it was like watching the World Cup! Dribbling, passing, pouncing oh, is pouncing not part of soccer?? Rex says it is! When meeting other dogs in playgroup, Rex was appropriate and tolerant with greetings and generally kept to himself and explored the yard. Rex is a people- oriented guy and was very happy to get attention from the handlers. Come meet Rex today!",

            "description": "Buddy (AKA Gaston) is an old friend ours here at PACC. Sadly it is not his first rodeo here but we love him and we are ready to find him a brand new home. Buddy's previous families had a lot of nice things to say about him. From his foster: he is housebroken and knows how to use a dog door. He is very polite in the house, never has accidents, doesn't jump on furniture and doesn't hurt anything. He greets everyone who comes to my house in a very nice and gentle way and everyone thinks he is very sweet. He loves long walks and to lie out in the sun. He does well with my chickens and loves to snuggle with me in my bed. His most recent adopter said that he did very well and was the perfect, happy gentleman at his home in a rural area, but when he moved to the city he had a very hard time adjusting and became anxious. Volunteers say that Buddy is a wonderful companion and he has always been a favorite for walkers. He is polite, curious, sweet and affectionate. He has all the love you could ever need and should be the only pupper in the home. Buddy has a hard time at the shelter and he really needs to get back into a comfy, safe home so that the can have the cozy retirement he deserves. Ask Buddy's volunteer advocate, Christy, about him: christy.holliger@gmail.com BUDDY IS ENROLLED IN THE GOOD DOG PROJECT AT PACC - Read a message from his case manager here: tinyurl.com/gdpmessage - Ask his case manager about him: rachel.jones@pima.gov",

He enjoys petting, and people that he connects with. He would love a home that can offer him affection and love, and a comfy couch to hang out on! Jimmy is on the smaller side of medium, only weighing 35lbs.\n\nWe always recommend crate training, exercise, playtime, and a regular schedule for potty breaks when bringing a new dog into your home. The shelter environment is much different than your home, so expect the unexpected. We do our best to help find the right pet for you, but your new dog may act differently on your turf than he/she did on ours.  Adjustment takes time for both you and your new family member, so remember to be patient and enjoy this new and exciting time!\nIncluded in the adoption fee are rabies (if applicable) & distemper vaccinations, heartworm testing, deworming, spay or neuter surgery.\n",

Previous vet records were obtained and this was found to be an infiltrative lipoma that had previous surgical removal attempted in 2018. The mass has since regrown. This is a type of benign fatty tumor, but the tumor has invaded into the muscle and while benign, still has the capability to grow over time. Removal with a boarded surgeon would be recommended if future adopters wish to perform surgery. Otherwise no surgical intervention with monitoring overtime is a valid option.",

Marley was surrendered to us by people who have surrendered several dogs in the past. Marley does fine with the other dogs and rides well in the car. His previous owner says that Marley is a snuggle bug and likes to play with toys. They also mentioned that Marley is gun shy and gets frightened when they pull out the BB gun to shoot at the rats. Marley was very patient with us on arrival while we were poking and prodding and checking him over. He seems to be a go with the flow type guy and will make an amazing companion. The Adoption Fee for this dog is $400.00\nAdoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a 'complete' pet. We accept CASH or Visa/Mastercard ONLY.\n\nJoyful Rescues has no funding except for our adoption fees and miscellaneous donations. Pet care and vet bills are expensive - you must be ready to take on this financial (as well as emotional) responsibility. YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 25 YEARS OF AGE TO ADOPT A DOG FROM JOYFUL RESCUES\n\nWe keep our pet list as up-to-date as possible. As soon as a pet is adopted, it is removed from the list. If a pet is still showing, it is still available for adoption.\n\nCan't Adopt Me? SPONSOR ME\nLook for the Link 'Special Instructions to Seller' if you want to note a particular pet\nBefore you seek to adopt a pet from Joyful Rescues, please read our Pet Adoption page http://www.joyfulrescues.org/pet_adoption.html.\n\nOnline Application",

I am really working on my keg like figure, hoping to get my six pack back real soon ;) I get along with dogs, cats, kids and adults. I am great on a leash and I love my walks and runs. I am looking for a family that is active and will help me accomplish my exercise goals- who wants to see that six pack??!?! Chocolate's adoption fee is $275 which covers his neuter, vaccinations, microchip and any additional medical care he may have needed while in the rescues care. We are a foster based rescue, we do not house dogs at a facility. Age and breed, is NLR's best guess as we often don't know who or what mom and dad are.

If he were a human, he\u2019d be a retired flagger \u2013 always ready to patrol when needed, but currently just interested in relaxing and spending time with his family. Bourbon seems to be more fond of men than women, so might do best with a male primary handler.\n\nBourbon is great with people and other dogs and hasn\u2019t had any issues with reactivity in his foster home. He loves walks and does well on a loose leash, even with distractions. He\u2019s been known to cuddle and likes affection from those he trusts. Bourbon rides well in the car, has no reactivity issues around loud noises, and does well at the veterinarian\u2019s office if he is muzzled. He is learning to be more comfortable alone and will often howl when left by himself, so he will need a family who can continue to work with him on reducing this behavior. Bourbon is non-destructive, fully crate trained, and has mastered basic obedience.\n\nBourbon\u2019s ideal home would be a quiet one where he can spend plenty of time with his handler. He will occasionally get bursts of energy that are satisfied with quick play sessions, however, is mostly quiet and prefers to just be near his person. Looking for that perfect retirement partner to warm up your winter? Bourbon is your guy!\n\nWEST COAST ADOPTIONS ONLY\n\nOur adoption process includes- completion of an application, followed by a telephone interview. If that goes well, we will arrange for a home visit.\nAdoption Fee: $500.00. Transport along Interstate 5 (Bakersfield, CA to Bellingham, WA) is available but cost not included in adoption fee.\n\nPlease visit www.woofproject.org and fill out an adoption application located here https://www.woofproject.org/application",

            "description": "Age: 1yr\nWeight: 70lbs\nEnergy Level: Moderate\nOverall Drive: Low\nLocation: Vancouver, WA\n\nKenzo thinks he is a lapdog, despite his 70-pound frame! He is a loyal companion and partner who wants nothing more than to be beside his handler. He is very sensitive and willing to please, and bonds to those around him quickly. If he were a human, Kenzo would be an apprentice \u2013 he is young, curious, and still gaining confidence but is always eager to learn new things.\nWhile Kenzo is affectionate and sweet with those he is familiar with, he is aloof with strangers. He will check in with his handler when a stranger approaches to see how to react but will usually warm up quickly with proper introduction. \n\nKenzo has high prey drive and thus will not be suited for a home with small children or animals. He is very interested in other dogs and gets very excited when he sees them. He needs slow, guided introductions with dogs as well given his shy nature and tendency towards uncertainty but is friendly, submissive, and sweet when allowed to meet others on his own terms. Kenzo rides well in the car, has done well at the veterinarian\u2019s office, and is mostly unfazed by loud noises. He will need a handler comfortable with moderate correction including some redirection when he becomes distracted. Kenzo is working on basic obedience and being calm in his crate during the day.\n\nKenzo will excel as an active companion to someone who can dedicate time to working with him as he continues to grow and mature. Once he builds trust with his new family, he will likely be a great adventure buddy for someone who is prepared to be a patient, yet firm. Kenzo\u2019s focus and desire to please would make him a great candidate for formal obedience or a water-based sport like dock diving. This student is looking for his perfect teacher \u2013 Kenzo is ready to be your prot\u00e9g\u00e9!\n\nWEST COAST ADOPTIONS ONLY\n\nMust have previous or current, purebred Malinois experience OR other high drive working breed experience\n\nOur adoption process includes- completion of an application, followed by a telephone interview. If that goes well, we will arrange for a home visit.\nAdoption Fee: $500.00. Transport along Interstate 5 (Bakersfield, CA to Bellingham, WA) is available but cost not included in adoption fee. \n\nPlease visit www.woofproject.org and fill out an adoption application located here https://www.woofproject.org/application",

            "description": "Finn is a big, gorgeous boy who was surrendered because his previous owner no longer had time to provide the training, exercise and attention that Finn needed. According to his previous owners, Finn is very playful and friendly with people, but he may bark or lunge at dogs when he is on leash or behind a barrier (like a fence). At this time we are primarily looking for a rescue to pull Finn to ensure he goes into a breed-savvy home that can handle his size and needs. HOWEVER, if you are experienced with large guardian breed dogs and/or leash reactivity and think Finn might be a good fit for your home, please make an appointment to speak with one of our virtual adoption counselors! Check out my photos/videos!",

            "description": "Apollo is a sweet boy that is LOVES children! He has high energy but still loves to be a couch potato. So if you're looking for a dog that you can take on walks and play with who will also enjoy sitting on the couch watching tv with you, Apollo is your guy! Apollo would like to go to a home without any small animals or cats in the home. Apollo is selective with other dogs so he may enjoy going to a home with canine pal.\n\nApollo would like to live in a house rather than an apartment, and he takes a little while to adjust to a new routine, for this reason it will be important for him to have time to decompress in the home environment. He has great leash manners and appears to be housebroken.\n\nWe always recommend crate training, exercise, playtime, and a regular schedule for potty breaks when bringing a new dog into your home. The shelter environment is much different than your home, so expect the unexpected. We do our best to help find the right pet for you, but your new dog may act differently on your turf than he/she did on ours.  Adjustment takes time for both you and your new family member, so remember to be patient and enjoy this new and exciting time!\nIncluded in the adoption fee are rabies (if applicable) & distemper vaccinations, heartworm testing, deworming, spay or neuter surgery.\n",

He wants to be your one and only, so he'll need a home with no other pets, please! He would benefit from a home with older or no children, basic obedience training and a family that's ready to provide as much love as Strudel can give! \nPlease contact Heidi's Village for more information on Strudel today!",

I'm still a young girl,  so I'm pretty active and I need daily structured exercise and discipline. I'm good on leash and I know basic commands .. but am a great student as I'm eager to please and quick to learn. I'm good with dogs in passing, but I'm a little too excited with small dogs so I could be with a tough small dog or a large dog and preferably a silly goofy male!  I've not lived with a cat so not sure how I would be with a cat but I've met them outside and didn't chase them but squirrels are a different story!! I'm CRAZY about balls!!!.. I love to fetch them and try to pop them if it's a soccer or basket ball...don't walk me by a basket ball court as I will want that ball and never leave! When I'm at home I'm a total snugglebug lap dog and I'm very well behaved. I would love to be with someone that will take me on lots of outdoor adventures and be their co-pilot!! If that's you...",

To apply read about our adoption policies\nhere\nto fill out an application.\nGood day to you friends. I am Berwin. A lot of you have probably heard of me already. When CARA brought me in I had come from a very bad situation. I had a broken jaw, which was not fixed, and it healed that way to where my mouth couldn't close. It caused me a lot of pain and made it very hard for me to eat. When I came to CARA you fine folks that support this rescue donated a lot of money so I could have a better life, and I had surgery to remove half my bottom jaw. When I went for my surgery they also found BB's under my skin, so everyone found out that more things have happened to me then they already knew. Well, the good news is I have now healed up from my surgery. I really enjoy being able to eat food without pain, and I am getting use to using my bottom jaw again. The better news is I am now allowed to be adopted, so I am looking for someone amazing out there who wants to give me the love I should of always received. I do have one request. I would really need a home with no cats. I am not their biggest fan, and hoping that someone out there is ok with that. Please put in an application and once it is approved they will set up an appointment for you to come meet me. Hope to be seeing you soon.To see more animals for adoption, please visit the CARA Website\n\nOur adoption fees are:\nDogs: $155\nCats: $95\nPuppies under 4 months: $115 plus S/N Deposit: $100\nKittens under 4 months: $70 plus S/N Deposit: $100\n\nAll pets available for adoption have been spayed or neutered (unless under 4 months please read about our adoptions\nhere\n), are current on vaccinations and preventatives, and micro-chipped. Cats have been tested and confirmed negative for Feline AIDS and Leukemia. Dogs have been tested for heartworm disease.\n\nOur shelter is located at 42 Deep River Rd in Sanford and is open Tues, Thurs, & Fri from 3pm - 7pm & Sat from 10-2pm (other times available by appointment). CARA's adoption process and online application can be found at\nhttp://www.cara-nc.org/info/adoption\n\nPlease call 919-774-9433, email adoptions@cara-nc.org, or visit www.cara-nc.org for information about this or other pets available for adoption.\n\nIf you would like to adopt me or any of my friends, please visit CARA to fill out an on-line application or e-mail us at adoptions@cara-nc.org.\n\nEvery animal that comes into the CARA program is here because one or more events occurred that led to this animal needing not only a home, but a person or family to love and protect them. Each animal has been loved and cared for by a small and determined group of people who want nothing more than to know each animal is safe for the rest of his or her life.

He was soon giving us kisses and rubbing his face on our hands for pets. He is currently boarding at our vet and he is in need of a foster home. He is currently undergoing heartworm treatment at our vet as well.\n\nCadillac seems to be good with dogs larger than him, but he is not good with small dogs or cats. \n\nCadillac is about 1-2 years old and weighs close to 45 lbs.

Parents were Kelpie and english bulldog with doxie or corgi? mixed in for fun.  They love chasing after the kids and dogs, as much as those stubby legs allow, and they make sure they are at the table at feeding time.  They are doggy door trained and sleep well in their crates at night.  They will be spayed and neutered right before adoption. We ask for a secure dedicated fenced yard and someone who has some at home time during the day to train them and give them the attention they deserve.  Please contact 4lvdch@bullerinetworks.net for a pre-adoption form which starts the process before the meet-up.",

Willow is extremely eager to please and listens very well and is incredibly smart. She has perfect recall and is easy to have off leash. She has a little bit of separation anxiety, but she has done fine being left alone in the house with Clipper. She sometimes will cry/husky howl if left tied up outside a store or in the car. She really wants to just be close to her human all the time. She does great in the car. Loves to run and play with all other dogs and will even cuddle up next to you on the couch if allowed. She's great with other dogs , although she would probably prefer that it just be her and Clipper in your home. Between her and Clipper she is the boss and sometimes takes his toys and treats. He is mellow so he just lets her do what she wants. She has many endearing qualities, including the husky talking and just general sweetness.",

He is approximately 70 lbs and about 5 years old. He is a very easy going husky, gets along with all dogs (including small dogs), and LOVES to cuddle. He would love a home where he could sleep in the bed, but he does just fine in his dog bed too. (Does not tolerate a crate). He is pretty good off leash and has good recall unless there are livestock or other temptations around. He responds to voice recall about 75-85% of the time. He loves a good run, but will be very mellow in the house. He is house trained and has never had an accident even when he was first adopted. He is a quieter husky, doesn't talk much. May try to counter surf, but we have been working with him on that.",

To apply read about our adoption policies\nhere\nto fill out an application.\nHi friends, my name is Mooshu and I am one of the newer faces here at CARA. It is taking me a little while to come out of my shell, but I am starting to learn that I can trust the people here. I am 4 1/2 years old and would love to be someone's little pride and joy, and the only focus of your attention, so being the only baby in the home is what is best for me. I hope that someone out there is willing to take a chance on me and show me what true love is all about. The rescue here does not know a lot about my past. I am particular about where I like to be touched, and we are hoping that someone will apply for me that knows a lot about the breed, and dogs with my particular personality. Please put in your application today, and once it is approved I would love to meet you.To see more animals for adoption, please visit the CARA Website\n\nOur adoption fees are:\nDogs: $155\nCats: $95\nPuppies under 4 months: $115 plus S/N Deposit: $100\nKittens under 4 months: $70 plus S/N Deposit: $100\n\nAll pets available for adoption have been spayed or neutered (unless under 4 months please read about our adoptions\nhere\n), are current on vaccinations and preventatives, and micro-chipped. Cats have been tested and confirmed negative for Feline AIDS and Leukemia. Dogs have been tested for heartworm disease.\n\nOur shelter is located at 42 Deep River Rd in Sanford and is open Tues, Thurs, & Fri from 3pm - 7pm & Sat from 10-2pm (other times available by appointment). CARA's adoption process and online application can be found at\nhttp://www.cara-nc.org/info/adoption\n\nPlease call 919-774-9433, email adoptions@cara-nc.org, or visit www.cara-nc.org for information about this or other pets available for adoption.\n\nIf you would like to adopt me or any of my friends, please visit CARA to fill out an on-line application or e-mail us at adoptions@cara-nc.org.\n\nEvery animal that comes into the CARA program is here because one or more events occurred that led to this animal needing not only a home, but a person or family to love and protect them. Each animal has been loved and cared for by a small and determined group of people who want nothing more than to know each animal is safe for the rest of his or her life. Thank you for looking to adopt!",

We have had the opportunity to play and spend time with Jazzy the last few weeks and are excited to share her profile. Jazzy is 4 years old\u2014 the perfect age! She\u2019s out of puppyhood, but loves being active. She is extremely responsive to cues and really eager to learn. Jazzy loves exploring and running in open areas. She is looking for an adopter who will take her on adventures and give her the quality time she deserves. Her family would need to help her practice calming indoor activities, after she has a nice walk of course! \n\nJazzy knows how to sit, lay down, touch, look, stay, leave it, and more! Completely potty trained, up to date on vaccines, and spayed. She is just a sweetie and will snuggle up to you immediately. \n\nManagement will be important at first since she is very playful; you\u2019ll have to keep desirable items like shoes and underwear off the floor! She seems to be good with both men and women; would do best as the only pet in the home; and although she is okay with kids, would prefer a no kid home. Families with older children with experience should still inquire. Jazzy enjoys meeting new people but a house without lots of excitement is best. \n\nEmail her rescue to apply: pawsomepupspersevere@yahoo.com",

Medical staff saw that I had something in my chin, and they ended up pulling out a bullet with a few pieces of my fractured jaw. However, this doesn't phase me, and I'm almost fully healed! My ideal home will have a fenced in yard for me to zoom around in, and have an active lifestyle. I will benefit from lots of positive reinforcement training and exercise. Right now I can only have things that are soft- like soft toys and treats- until I'm fully healed. Ask an adoption counselor to meet with me today! \n\n\n\nBusy BeeI'm a naturally playful, curious, and trusting canine. Take me for a big walk every day; give me something to do. After my job's done, I'll curl up in front of the fire with you in the evenings.

He needs a forever home willing to work with him on building confidence and that will be patient with him, as well as continue his training. He is crate and potty trained, and will require a fenced in yard. He has not been tested with children, however they are not recommended due to his timid nature. He does like to chase, which includes his foster home cats and horses. He is neutered, UTD on vacc., microchipped, and kept on monthly flea/tick/hw prevention. To apply to adopt visit\nwww.handsofhoperescue.com/adoptapp\n.\nOden's adoption fee is $250. All adoptions require a completed ADOPTION APPLICATION. Once your application is approved, we will put you in touch with the dogs foster to see if you and the pet are a good match. If so, we will arrange a meeting for you and the pet. This dog is fostered in Hays, KS and adopter must drive to pick up. We do not ship or deliver. We do allow out of state adoptions, however qualified in state applications will be given preference. Please Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs.

Please call us at 604-275-2036 to set up an appointment.**\n\nPERSONALITY: Bumble came into the Shelter through no fault of her own. Bumble is a very high energy, fun loving, sweet girl. She loves getting attention and cuddles from her human friends. She also loves playing with toys and has no problem keeping herself entertained - she is known for chasing shadows and light, like a cat.\n\nWe have come to learn that Bumble is under socialized with dogs and because of this has reactivity when seeing and meeting most dogs. Bumble also has prey drive - so no small dogs or small animals in the home with her. We are looking for an active home with a calm, confident handler that has experience with dog reactivity and is willing to work with Bumble on her socialization and manners.\n\nBumble is also a very strong, bouncy girl that can be rather high strung, therefore we are looking for a home with no small children - 12 years or older.\n\nDue to BSL we are hoping to find a home for Bumble outside of Richmond and Burnaby as she hates wearing a muzzle. She has been spayed, microchipped and vaccinated with us. \n\nLIKES: Cuddles and attention.\n  \nDISLIKES: Being alone.\n  \nAGE: Just over a year old.\n \nIf you are interested in Bumble, you can call our shelter at 604-275-2036, or email us at info@rapsbc.com to book a Meet & Greet.",

After her surgery she will need strict crate rest (as she is getting here at the shelter), short, leashed walks only for bathroom breaks, will be on medications, and will have a few trips to the vet that the foster will help with.\nAll post-surgical care will be shared with the foster of course and we will help with any questions regarding Bumble's recovery journey.",

She really loves the company of other dogs and because she is scared she would do best in a home without young kids. She doesn\u2019t have a mean bone in her body, we just don\u2019t want her to spend her days afraid with young kids around. She is timid around men but just needs some patience and love to help her come around. Aurora also LOVES to go for walks and would make a great companion for someone with a quieter home.\n\n\n\nHeart-worm negative, current on vaccines.

This means I don't have a specific recognizable breed. The rescue uses the following guide which are guesses based on my current size and age for how big I will be when full grown: Mixed Breed (small) up to 25 pounds - Mixed Breed (medium) between 25-45 pounds - Mixed Breed (large) more than 50 pounds. For more information on, please visit the website https://faithfulfriendsrescue.org/adoptable-pets.\n\nWe are setting up adoptions with approved adopters on an appointment basis. We are no longer hosting adoption events at PetSmart until further notice. We are not arranging meet and greets; but appointments to finalize adoptions to limit exposure for all. Our adoptions come with a one week trial period in which if things are not working out, we will refund your adoption fee if you decide to return your newly adopted Faithful Friend. Our adoptions must be done in person and we do not arrange transport to adopters. Our adoption fees vary and we are only able to accept payments by card* at this time but include spay/neuter, heartworm test (dogs), FeLV/FIV test (cats), age appropriate vaccines and deworming, flea, tick and heartworm medication and microchip.",

We review each application and do our absolute best in choosing a home that best suits each dog and his/her needs and personality. Teddy came to us from a horrible hoarding situation and was heart worm positive. Several dogs coming out of that hoarding situation have had a wide variety of broken bones, we are assuming due to malnutrition. We are working on strengthening his bones. We don't foresee any broken bones in his future, but want to disclose all we can about his past. As Teddy's heartworm treatment is complete, he is learning how to be a dog. Teddy is not housebroke and is learning how to play, he has recently figured out that the soft toys are fun to toss in the air. If you have an abundance of patience and would like to see a dog become a pet and learn how to play and not be fearful of humans, this is your chance. Teddy is skittish and will take time to warm up and adjust to your home. Patience is mandatory with this guy. 1/21/21 8:55 PM",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Tucker aka Tux! My family uses both names and I have already figured out that's me! I was a stray on the streets for several months before animal control finally grabbed me I hated the shelter and shut down there and sadly no one ever came looking for me. Then I was rescued and from there, there's so much to tell you about me, I hardly know where to start so here goes\n\nMy mom says if she didn't already have 4 dogs of her own, she'd be keeping me (she said she also doesn't want daddy to leave her)! The vet says I'm about 18 months old, so I still have alot of puppy energy! So I need a home that has time for me. I think I'm going to start with the things mom says make me more challenging at times - which is a short list! I need some work on leash manners - I do awesome and walk pretty well until I see another dog - then I get overly excited and want to meet them. Mom says it's not aggressive at all, it's just excitement that gets crazy. I'm very food motivated though, so treats to distract and reward are definitely helping me focus! Just today, after 4-5 training treats (and lots of praise), I successfully passed three dogs with only a few episodes of losing sight of my mom! Mom was super proud of me! We are still exploring the best leash to help me redirect my attention.\nMealtime is super exciting for me!! Mom tried once to leave me out of my crate while she was getting food bowls ready and decided that wasn't her best idea (of course that was shortly after I got here too!). I did figure eights around the kitchen and living room in excitement while she chased me down. I thought it was great - my mom wasn't as excited about it. So now I know to just go right in my crate when she tells me to and I sit and wait for her to make breakfast and dinner! The crate scared me at first and I didn't like it, but as I said, I'm food motivated so mom would toss a treat in the back of the crate for me and I'd go right in!! I'm even beginning to know how to sit and 'leave it' (for a few seconds) when mom puts my meal in my crate. I do talk to her when I'm in thereI'm just excited to eat!! :) When I'm done eating though, I'll wait quietly for mom to let me out while everyone else finishes their meal. Let me be clear - this is the ONLY time mom has to crate me! My dad is working from home and can let me out during the day, but I've NEVER had an accident in the house and I've even scratched at the door in the middle of the night asking to go out a couple of times. Mom leaves the door to the crate open though, and occasionally now she'll find me sleeping in there!\n\nI am going to daycare with my brothers and sisters and they say I jump right in and start playing!! I absolutely love daycare and I pass out when I get homeI play hard while I'm there! I have loved all my 15 year old skin brothers friends that come in and are super loud alot and of course they love me too! I sleep through the night in a dog bed next to my mom. I do crawl into bed though and she laughs at me because she's never seen a dane lift the covers and burrow himself under them and fall asleep COMPLETELY buried like I do!! It really makes me happy, so if there's room in your bed, I'd really love that! I can play pretty rough at times, so I'd love another dog to run and wrestle with! Mom thinks young kids probably wouldn't be the best for me since I don't really know my puppy strength and size when I'm running and playing. She doesn't want me to accidentally hurt a little one in the house. And like most danes, I just sit wherever it looks comfortable even if there's already someone sitting there! lol\n\nI already have mastered sit and shake!! We're working on down and stay and I'm making progress, but still need just a bit more time to conquer those! I just take off when mom tries to wipe my feet, but if she encourages me, I'll let her do it when it's necessary! When I first got here, I would jump on mom and whoever else came in the door I rarely do that now, as I realize I only get love and attention when I don't. I'm a fast learner for certain!! Mom also thinks it's hilarious that when she goes in the garage to leave, I run upstairs to the 2nd floor bonus room and she can see me watching her leave with my snout pressed on the window!!\n\nSooo, basically I'm about a perfect family member! My mom thinks I'm the 'cat's meow' BUT... I may be the cat's meow but I need a home with NO cats as that is the one thing I am not good with. I hope you'll consider me in your search for the newest addition to your home!\n\nhttps://greatdanefriends.com/tucker\n\nPlease contact Great Dane Friends (info@greatdanefriends.com) for more information about this pet.\n\n*****Great Dane Friends of Ruff Love covers NC and surrounding states for adoptions. We require a fenced yard (exceptions made on a case by case basis - NO exceptions for puppies or deaf/vision impaired dogs - no invisible fencing), that stairs in the home be covered with some sort of slip resistant material to prevent injury, that all other animals in the home be up to date on vaccinations as well as spayed/neutered and that all dogs live inside as a part of the family. Our approval process consists of an application, vet and reference checks, phone interview and house check. Please email us for an application or if you have any questions.*****",

If you had another dog in the household, we would want Kai to meet that dog before going home. \n\nKai is a little zoned in around cats, so I dont think he would be a good option for a household with cats. \n\nIm sure he would do well with kids, but he is very big and doesnt know how big he actually is.\n\nIf interested in this beautiful dude please send us an email at hoisingtonvet@gmail.com",

She needs someone who is willing to give her time and space to adjust in a new loving home. \n\nI'm not sure how she ended up at he local shelter but my guess is she was an outside only dog or a farm dog and finally wandered off. She is very head shy and will cower if approached quickly. She has gotten more comfortable over time since she has been with us\n\nShe was originally afraid of the leash and didn't want to come inside, but now she leashes and walks well, she is also comfortable in her kennel.\n\nShe has never made a mess in her kennel. We have not been able to see what she does around cats but at the previous shelter she seemed fine with dogs(mainly just ignored them). \n\nGemma is looking for her second chance, I think once she is comfortable in her new surroundings she will make an amazing dog. She just needs the right person to give her a chance. \n\nIf interested in Gemma please send an email to hoisingtonvet@gmail.com",

Oliver is a house and crate 1 1/2 year old, 75 lb Rhodesian/Hound mix who is being fostered on Long Island and is looking for a forever home. HIs foster mom says that Oliver has great indoor manners, is very well behaved, calm, loves to play with her dog in the backyard, really just chills during the day, and is very good with her daughters (He grew up with a 10 year old little girl). Oliver barks at strangers and needs a warm up period to feel comfortable. Once he knows you, he bonds super quickly. He particularly loves the ladies, and he'd be great with a family who doesn't mind his bark and is looking for a well behaved companion to happily hang out during the day. BONUS: He's good with cats. Ollie is neutered, microchipped, and vaccinated, and his adoption fee is $500.",

I am also crate trained and really working on potty training.\n\nI am easy to adjust to a new home. \n\nDancer is in Houston, but can transport to the Pacific Northwest when adopted. We have transports every 2 weeks. For more information please go to www.springbranchrescue.org and complete an adoption application.",

Fila was born into a hoarding situation, and all she knew for the first 8 weeks of her life was neglect and filthy living conditions. Thankfully, we were able to pull Fila out of there and now her life is back on track. And that track is straight on to happiness!

            "description": "Brewster T. is a sweet 9-year-old male German Shepherd Dog who was surrendered by his owner to a shelter in Southern California. His owner lost his home and could no longer provide for Brewster. Brewster was emaciated and confused about what was happening. At the shelter he was friendly and sweet despite the many changes he was going through. Brewster has some arthritis but he enjoys walks and walks well on leash. Brewster is reserved but is eager to get attention and engages well with people. He is well mannered, house trained, gets along peacefully with other dogs and rides well in the car. He shows no food aggression or other difficult behaviors. Brewster needs a family to give him the stability and love he craves!\n\nBrewster T. Summary:\n- Brewster is a male, 9 yrs old, weighs 65 lbs, current on shots\n- Good with Adults, dogs, and travel in the car\n- Children & Cats TBD\n\nBrewster passed a set of evaluation tests before being accepted into the TSGSR. The tests are not intended to assess how smart the dog is but are important for TSGSR to determine if the dog is expected to be safe in a family home. The tested behaviors check to see if the dog will guard or protect food or toys from people, will tolerate handling all over its body (including ears, nose, lips to check teeth, lifting paws, belly, back, and gently pulling the tail) and the ability to get along with other well behaved dogs. He remained calm during all of these tests and showed no aggressive tendencies. \n\nPlease join us in welcoming Brewster to TSGSR! Check back often. We will be updating his bio as we learn more about him!\n\nWhat's Next for Brewster T:\nThulani Senior German Shepherd Rescue (TSGSR) will continue to see that Brewster is well cared for and receives all medical care needed for his well being while in our care. In addition, TSGSR is beginning a search for an adoptive home that will care for him for the rest of his life. He will come to his new home with a supply of food, a cushy pad if wanted, and other goodies such as toys. \n\nBrewster is a younger senior. As such there is no adoption fee but limited medical coverage. Please talk to the TSGSR staff about the coverage.\n\nIf you want to learn more about Brewster, or are interested in possibly providing an adoptive or foster home, please send us a message by clicking on the \"Ask About Me\" button. We will often get feedback or \"updates\" from a dog's foster home and as any updates become available they will be included here.\n\nIf you are reading about him on Petfinder.com sometimes an available YouTube video is not listed. If this occurs you can still view the video by pasting its URL into a new browser window or tab.\n\nAvailable Video URL(s): https://youtu.be/W4DIj-s0nTc\n\nSaving one dog wont change the world. It will change the world for that one dog.",

She loves to go on walks and is a very good on a leash. In her current foster home, she is crated when left alone with no issues. She also loves to cuddle. Would you like to meet this pretty girl???? \n\nAll dogs are spayed/neutered, up to date on vaccinations, heartworm tested negative (age 7 months and older) and microchipped. We do not ship or transport. A dog's adoption donation is $200. There is a $5 fee for credit/debit cards.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting one of our dogs, please fill out an online application here: www.heartlandsmallanimalrescue.org/canine-application.html",

She doesn't seem to be too food or toy motivated, so good praise and pets are her training tools. She walks well on leash and likes to meander a bit and sniff the flowers! Since she likes to be the boss, she would do best with a real even-tempered dog or maybe be the one and only. Shelter staff will help with any introductions. She is very gentle and loving and gives great kisses! Could this be the beautiful, sweet gal you've been looking for? Buffy currently weighs in at 62lbs.",

            "description": "Looks like: Border Collie/Aussie\nMale, 14 years old, 34 pounds\n\nThis handsome and sweet boy is looking for an adopter. He was once called Davie, but is now known as Kupuna. This is because in Hawaii, the wise elders are known as Kupuna, which are the honored ones, deserving of respect and special care like this guy needs and deserves. Despite his frailty, he has a depth of spirit and resilience that has inspired everyone he's met. He was emaciated and unable to walk when brought in and yet he quickly made major improvements. However, he is unlikely to ever be able to go on walks or otherwise be active. Thankfully, he is very affectionate and loves to be gently petted and be around people. He is a very sweet and loving guy. His mobility issues are due to spinal arthritis but he can get around a home decently despite a hunch in his back. He gets along well with other dogs and has an overall docile personality. \n\nKupuna's ideal weight is 40 pounds and he is doing some physical therapy to help his mobility. He is also completely deaf and struggles with fecal incontinence due to lack of control of his hind end. Kupuna will need a very special home. He is a wonderful, loving dog who follows his person around the best he can but his energy level is pretty low and that's reflected in all aspects of his behavior. He needs an adopter who will accommodate his condition. One where he will be given the care he needs, excellent food and a lot of affection. He will not do well with stairs, hyperactive or pushy dogs, and probably no young children. He is a quiet boy looking for a calm home. \n\nDavie came to us from Hitchcock Road Animal Services after being surrendered by his guardian who could no longer care for him.",

She is a beautiful 1.5 year old chihuahua and she weighs about 5 pounds. Gucci hails from Texas and she was getting a little too big for her britches there according to her owner. They were about to send her to a shelter when we intercepted to get her to NY!\n\nGucci is a chihuahua lover's dream! She is very sweet to her foster mom and loves to sleep on her neck when it's nap time. Initially she would growl at the other dogs in the house but that soon stopped. Now she sleeps along side of them. She LOVES cats - LOVES!! She is so excited when she sees one and gives it kisses non-stop. She is crate trained and will often go inside for a nap. We were told she was guarding a crate and items in Texas but we haven't had that issue here. She has actually become playful with the other little dogs in the house. We think the stress of losing her home and the journey here could have been the issue. Gucci is a typical chihuahua with her potty habits - it's when she feel like going outside, she goes. Other then that, she uses the potty pads pretty consistently. She does have a fully fenced yard in her foster home. Gucci loves treats and will sit very nicely to get one. Gucci is not overly friendly with new people but when she knows, she is a loyal dog to her person. Since she is so small, we prefer no large dogs in her future home. We will also prefer older kids 12+ at least. Gucci would love a home that has chihuahua experience as they can be quirky little dogs - especially the tiny ones!\n\nGucci is spayed, up to date with vaccines, microchipped, flea/worm treated and tested neg. for heartworm. Her adoption fee is $400",

He is about a year old. He is a very high energy, playful boy that will need lots of exercise. He gets a little nippy when playing so small children probably wouldn't be a good idea. He likes to chase the cats and terrorize them so a tolerant cat would be ok.

After months of waiting his fate, we finally were told he gets to live the rest of his life knowing LOVE! We are excited to see Honey have his happy ever after. \nHoney is crate trained and will vocalize when he needs to go potty. He loves walks and has started to play with the other dogs in his foster home. Some of his favorite activities is sunbathing, laying in laps and sleeping under the covers. He is also great with cats. Honey does have a heart murmur but at this time it does not require any medication or medical intervention. While Honey may be shy to open up at first once he does he is a lover! \n\nTo set up a meet and greet or inquire about a dog, please first fill out an application at https://savinghoperescue.org/contact. It doesn't obligate you, but it is the first step. We don't get to all of the inquiries but respond to all applications. Thank you for choosing to rescue!",

Said to be a boxer/pitt bull mix, but she doesn\u2019t have the goofy, rambunctious \n            personality of either breed. \n\n    ?  Marlee is very gentle and calm with soulful eye contact. \n  \n   ?  Seems to have a fairly serious outlook on life, not familiar with toys. \n\n?  Marlee enjoys walks and has very good leash manners. \n\n?  Brought to the shelter because she does not get along with cats. \n\n    ?

I have tested positive for heart-worm and Lyme disease, but I am now done with all my medications for my heart worm and Lyme disease. I will just need to be on heart-worm medication once a month for the rest of my life.\nI have a lot of energy and I love to play, so I will need someone who is going to exercise me to get all my energy out.\nI will probably need to be on a tie out when I am outside or trained not to escape the fence as I can climb the fence and like to dig under the fence to get out.\nI get along with kids so if you have any kids in your home we should get along just fine.\nI am really picky on dogs so if you have any dogs in the home please make sure you bring them along to the meet and greet with you to see if we would get along.\nMy adoption fee is $185 with a qualified application.\nIf you'd like to adopt me you can put your application in for me at the shelter website Stephenmemorial.org and once it has been qualified you will get a call to set up a date and time to meet with me.",

Mia is spayed, up-to-date on vaccinations, and is housetrained; now she just needs a new home and family of her very own!  Mia is looking for a family that understands she is a working breed dog with high energy and an active mind that requires stimulation.  She will need plenty of physical and mental exercise to keep her content in her new home.  She is very sweet and loving and did fantastic on her temperament test.  She would be okay with older children who have been taught how to properly interact with dogs. \n\n Mia has a high prey drive so she would not be good with cats or small animals.  She is dog-neutral (non-aggressive, non-reactive towards other dogs, but prefers them to stay out of her space). Mia prefers to be the only pet in the home.    \n\nIf you are interested in meeting Mia, please fill out the online adoption application found here (please copy and paste this URL into your browser): https://forms.gle/CWMLcZzSSqvBUgWe7\n\nYou can find more information about our adoption policy on our organizational PetFinder homepage.",

            "description": "On Nov. 26th an estimated 8 month old (DOB 3-29-20) black and white male Pitbull was brought to Northwood on emergency. He  had jumped off a 3 foot wall and landed poorly the day before.  He immediately came up lame in the right rear leg.  He was still not willing to use the right rear leg at all at time of exam.  Radiographs showed fractures of the right tibia and fibula at the level of stifle/knee. The owner relinquished him so he could get the surgery he needed.  We named him Ham Bone (the name fits). Ham Bone was treated for internal and external parasites.  He was also vaccinated.  Ham Bone had surgery 12-3-20 to cross pin the avulsed piece of bone at the top of his tibia.  Surgery was difficult as the surgical site had fibrosed in and the avulsed piece of bone was so fragile that it broke into small pieces.  The surgeon finally got some degree of reattachment to the damaged bone then he placed the leg in a cast to restrict Ham Bone\u2019s movement on the tenuous repair.  The day after surgery, Hambone started vomiting and having diarrhea.  A parvo test was positive.  Hambone was treated for Parvo and did well.  Within 2 days Hambone was eating again, doing well. He is neutered and ready to be adopted. Now this goof ball is ready for his forever home.\n\nName: Hambone\nSpecies: Canine/ Pitbull\nGender: Male/Neutered\nBirthday: 03/29/20\nCurrent Location: Northwood Animal Hospital\nMinimum Adoption Donation: $100",

I LOVE people--I'm a social butterfly who gets along with new people and gets excited to make new friends. I would snuggle all day long if you'd let me! I have lived with young children before and am very good with kids. I have also lived with cats, and although I'm known to chase them from time to time, I can live peacefully with them.  While I can meet some dogs politely, I do not do well with all dogs, and I can be protective of my things and would do better living as the only dog in my new home. I'm not protective with people though--I'm super gentle :)  I get a little anxious when left alone so would do best with someone who can spend more time with me. I'm crate trained though which helps with acclimation big time! I  ride well in the car, too!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting this pet, please call 541 474 5458 for an appointment. All appointments are made by phone for the most up to date availability of the pets and the schedule. Thank you.",

She loves attention and will happily take a treat and \"sit\" for you. \n\nKitty is an all-around pretty calm girl, but she gets excited when playing with toys and enjoys playing outside in the snow. Kitty would do best in a home as the only pet so she can soak up all the love that her new family will give her!\n\nAdoption fee includes spay/neuter, vaccinations, worming, microchip, and a start on flea/tick prevention.\n\nFor more information, please call CBHS adoptions at 319-232-6887 or email at adoptioncounselor@yahoo.com.",

This sweet, active girl loves to spend time outside doing zoomies in the yard! Inside she loves to curl up next to you (or on you!) and give you all the cuddles. Lady is a good listener, crate trained, house trained, dog friendly, and kid friendly. She would do best in a home without cats and with older children!\n\nInterested in adding Lady to your family? Apply online today!\n\nIf you are interested in adding this pup to your family, please submit an application at www.petrescuealliance.com. All questions will be answered and meet and greets set up following a review of application. If the dog is listed on our website or Petfinder, they are still available! Pet Rescue Alliance does our best to provide accurate information about the dogs we have available for adoption. We cannot make any guarantees about age, breed or temperament.",

Mona is very shy and can take a while to warm up to new visitors. She does seem to enjoy the company of other dogs and becomes a bit more confident when they're around. Mona has not been tested yet with cats or had a recommendation about children. Stay tuned for updates!\n\nIf you're interested in meeting or adopting Mona, please complete an application at: inapl.org/adoption-application. Once it's processed, a member of our team will be in touch with you to schedule a meet and greet appointment. This is the time when you and all members of your household will come to our shelter to officially make your connection with Mona.\n\nMona\nPit Bull Terrier mix\nFemale\nDOB: 10/20/2017",

He's part Shepherd, part Heeler so he's smart and strong and needs both mental and physical activites to keep him happy and healthy. Great outdoor adventure dog for someone with an active lifestyle.

Please read the bio before sending questions - we answer all we know about the dog here.\n\nIzzy's looking for her forever home She was left on her own wandering around a Good Samaritan reached out to Heidi's Legacy to help find her forever home. We think she's between 6 and 7 months old and she weighs under 50 lb. We don't think she's going to get much larger.\nShe loves to run and chase the ball. She enjoys her crate and sleeps through the night. She only barks when she sees dogs or cats...mostly because she wants to play with the dogs We're not really sure what she wants to do with the cat. She needs to work on walking on a leash , not counter-surfing and taking treats but these things can be taken care of when you do the obedience training .\n\nIzzy's Adoption fee is $400 - obedience training is required\n\nObedience training is also required for all our pups. We understand with what is going on in the world that this may be a bit delayed.

I dont like other dogs as I was left in a small outdoor kennel with my brother for 2 years where we had to fight over our food and attention. I also am not a fan of cats as I see them as a toy. I would love for a home with a fenced in yard that I can run in without having to be chained. I do okay on a leash but I need a little more practice. I do have a harness already so no need to buy one for me.",

He is very loving and attentive to his people, and loves to give you all the hugs in the world!!   So far in his foster home he has made friends with the neighbor kids, loves playing outside, and loves to watch TV.\n\nIf you would like to be considered as a potential adopter for one of our great dogs, please go to our website- www.luckymuttsrescue.org and submit an application. Our application process includes landlord approval and vet checks. Please make sure all of your information is current and accurate, including a valid email address and phone numbers. Inaccuracies and/or incomplete data will delay and/or cancel your application.  We strive to process all applications in a timely manner, but with the high volume of applications we are receiving, it is taking anywhere from 1-3 weeks.  You may be contacted via email if there are concerns or questions.  Once all of your information is reviewed and if your application is approved, you will be notified via email.  Submitting an application and receiving an approval does not guarantee you will be adopting the dog you applied for.  Once you move to the meet and greet process, you will be contacted by the foster family to further discuss the dog, and answer questions you may have, and if applicable, a meet and greet will be set up at our adoption center.   Meet and greets are only set up with approved applicants, and we require all members in the household to be present, as well as any current dogs in the home. \n\nCurrent Adoption Fees Are:\n$400+tax for puppies to 3 years old\n$350+tax for ages 4-7\n$250+tax for ages 8 and up\nBonded pairs vary\n\nThe adoption fee covers spay/neuter, up to date age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, general deworming, heartworm test, (if over 6  months) and a certified veterinary inspection. Please be aware, listed dog breeds are based on information provided and cannot be guaranteed.  Submitting an application for a particular dog does not guarantee that you will be the applicant chosen, we receive several applications for each dog. Our adopters are picked based on the needs of the dog, and the home we feel with best fit based on your responses to our application, vet information and landlord requirements.   Approved applicants not chosen for the dog you applied for, will be in active status for a period of six months.  We encourage you to watch Petfinder, Facebook and our website for upcoming dogs.  Should you see a dog that interests you, please send us a Facebook message or an email with your approval number.  Please be patient with us, as Lucky Mutts Rescue is run strictly by volunteers and many of us work full time jobs, have families and also foster dogs. Thank you for considering Lucky Mutts Rescue for your next furry family member!",

            "description": "Rodger is a 2 year old chocolate lab mix who weighs 65 lbs.  He has a ton of energy when he runs outside, but once he's tired himself out, he's usually calm inside.  Roger is quite intelligent and extremely interested in pleasing his human(s).  As a result, he has already improved his behavior in most areas.  He sits when told, stays in the back seat of the car, and waits on his leash to go out until the garage door is fully open.  Rodger loves car rides, playing in the snow, and squeaky toys.  He craves cuddles, hugs, and just being close.  Rodger still has some challenges -- he pulls on his leash (although less so over time), and sometimes barks at other dogs when on a walk.  Rodger would do well with a fenced in yard, since he's super fast and a very athletic runner, at times performing gymnastic style jumps!  If you're looking for a playful and loyal buddy who is very affectionate, and you're willing to put some effort into a fast learner, Rodger would be perfect!\n\nIf you would like to be considered as a potential adopter for one of our great dogs, please go to our website- www.luckymuttsrescue.org and submit an application. Our application process includes landlord approval and vet checks. Please make sure all of your information is current and accurate, including a valid email address and phone numbers. Inaccuracies and/or incomplete data will delay and/or cancel your application.  We strive to process all applications in a timely manner, but with the high volume of applications we are receiving, it is taking anywhere from 1-3 weeks.  You may be contacted via email if there are concerns or questions.  Once all of your information is reviewed and if your application is approved, you will be notified via email.  Submitting an application and receiving an approval does not guarantee you will be adopting the dog you applied for.  Once you move to the meet and greet process, you will be contacted by the foster family to further discuss the dog, and answer questions you may have, and if applicable, a meet and greet will be set up at our adoption center.   Meet and greets are only set up with approved applicants, and we require all members in the household to be present, as well as any current dogs in the home. \n\nCurrent Adoption Fees Are:\n$400+tax for puppies to 3 years old\n$350+tax for ages 4-7\n$250+tax for ages 8 and up\nBonded pairs vary\n\nThe adoption fee covers spay/neuter, up to date age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, general deworming, heartworm test, (if over 6  months) and a certified veterinary inspection. Please be aware, listed dog breeds are based on information provided and cannot be guaranteed.  Submitting an application for a particular dog does not guarantee that you will be the applicant chosen, we receive several applications for each dog. Our adopters are picked based on the needs of the dog, and the home we feel with best fit based on your responses to our application, vet information and landlord requirements.   Approved applicants not chosen for the dog you applied for, will be in active status for a period of six months.  We encourage you to watch Petfinder, Facebook and our website for upcoming dogs.  Should you see a dog that interests you, please send us a Facebook message or an email with your approval number.  Please be patient with us, as Lucky Mutts Rescue is run strictly by volunteers and many of us work full time jobs, have families and also foster dogs. Thank you for considering Lucky Mutts Rescue for your next furry family member!",

Our application process includes landlord approval and vet checks. Please make sure all of your information is current and accurate, including a valid email address and phone numbers. Inaccuracies and/or incomplete data will delay and/or cancel your application.  We strive to process all applications in a timely manner, but with the high volume of applications we are receiving, it is taking anywhere from 1-3 weeks.  You may be contacted via email if there are concerns or questions.  Once all of your information is reviewed and if your application is approved, you will be notified via email.  Submitting an application and receiving an approval does not guarantee you will be adopting the dog you applied for.  Once you move to the meet and greet process, you will be contacted by the foster family to further discuss the dog, and answer questions you may have, and if applicable, a meet and greet will be set up at our adoption center.   Meet and greets are only set up with approved applicants, and we require all members in the household to be present, as well as any current dogs in the home. \n\nCurrent Adoption Fees Are:\n$400+tax for puppies to 3 years old\n$350+tax for ages 4-7\n$250+tax for ages 8 and up\nBonded pairs vary\n\nThe adoption fee covers spay/neuter, up to date age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, general deworming, heartworm test, (if over 6  months) and a certified veterinary inspection. Please be aware, listed dog breeds are based on information provided and cannot be guaranteed.  Submitting an application for a particular dog does not guarantee that you will be the applicant chosen, we receive several applications for each dog. Our adopters are picked based on the needs of the dog, and the home we feel with best fit based on your responses to our application, vet information and landlord requirements.   Approved applicants not chosen for the dog you applied for, will be in active status for a period of six months.  We encourage you to watch Petfinder, Facebook and our website for upcoming dogs.  Should you see a dog that interests you, please send us a Facebook message or an email with your approval number.  Please be patient with us, as Lucky Mutts Rescue is run strictly by volunteers and many of us work full time jobs, have families and also foster dogs. Thank you for considering Lucky Mutts Rescue for your next furry family member!",

This Doxie is NOT at Oregon Dachshund Rescue, Inc. \n\nMeet Goldie -\n\nGoldie is an adorable 10 year old  neutered male dachshund. He is a real love and so appreciative to be saved. He is extremely overweight needs vetting and a full dental with extractions.  We are partnering  with dachshund rescue of Los Angeles. Any questions please contact ODR Jenell at  jrangan@comcast.net. More information in the near future. \n\nIf you or anyone you know can help, please share this email or contact Jenell at jrangan@comcast.net \n\nPlease note,  this is a Courtesy Listing for a doxie that is NOT at Oregon Dachshund Rescue, Inc. We are helping the owner find his/her new forever family. Oregon Dachshund Rescue, Inc. has posted this dog as available for adoption or rescue intake as a courtesy accommodation to the dog's owner. Any and all information, photos, etc. have been provided by the dog's owner. Oregon Dachshund Rescue, Inc. is not responsible for the accuracy of any of the information contained in this listing or any information that may have been omitted. Thank you!\n\nODR, INC. ADOPTION CRITERIA (aka Our Fine Print):\nBased on 30 years of experience with rescue doxies, we have pretty strict criteria for dogs that we adopt and that we recommend to owners whose doxies we list courtesy posts for, the sole aim of which is to facilitate a successful adoption with a forever family. \n\n*Do you work from home/stay at home/work part time?  \n*Have a securely fenced yard? \n*We do not place same gender dogs in a home unless they were raised together, and *Children need to be 12 or older (some exceptions IF the dog is a puppy or the child has been raised with a doxie). \n*We prefer non smokers and a home with no other small animals (ferrets, hamsters, etc). *Cats are on a case by case basis depending on the dog. \n\nRemember these are rescues, many were surrendered because of these or similar issues.\n\nThank you!",

Just copy and paste the link below into your browser (or simply type it in) and then search for the dog's \"gallery\" by name\n\n          http://adoptasleddog.smugmug.com\n\nVIDEOS:  In addition to photo albums, almost every dog has a video which will give you a much better \"feel\" for his or her personality.  NOTE:  In the new Petfinder format, it has become quite a bit more difficult to find and to play videos.  Please PAGE THROUGH the photos, looking for a photo overlaid in the center with a \"play\" arrow inside a circle.  This icon is white, so it can be difficult to see. \n In many (most) cases, the video is the last photo displayed as you page through.  Just click on that photo and it will play.  Please make sure you CHECK ON THE PETFINDER VIDEO ICON, above, to see a video of this wonderful dog!  Our videos will include, at a minimum, whatever info we had on the dog upon (or shortly after) his/her arrival into our program.  There will sometimes be video updates as well.  And in every case, our Adoptions Coordinator can be emailed at ADOPTASLEDDOG@AOL.COM to answer questions and provide the most current information we have on the dog.  \n\nNOTES:  Please see video or contact our Adoptions Coordinator at ADOPTASLEDDOG@AOL.COM.\n\nADOPTION DONATION:  $250  Before adoption, all Northern Lights dogs (regardless of whether Petfinder's symbols appear) are spayed or neutered, microchipped, heartworm negative, fully vaccinated and tested/treated for known parasites.\n \nWHAT TO DO IF YOU WANT TO ADOPT THIS DOG:  Email us at ADOPTASLEDDOG@AOL.COM to request an application and get started.  WE DO NOT HAVE AN ONLINE APPLICATION - you will have to request one via email.  We will review your application to determine if there is a good fit between you and/or your family and this dog.  We may suggest another dog or dog(s) if we can offer a better fit in terms of lifestyle, experience, other pets, etc.  A vet check, reference checks, and a home visit will be conducted before an adoption can be considered for approval.  \n \nNORTHERN LIGHTS DOES NOT HAVE A PHYSICAL SHELTER.  We are a nonprofit rescue organization comprised of individuals who open their private homes to foster dogs in need of a second chance..  When fosters are not available, we often pay to board a dog until space is available.  New fosters and donations to pay for boarding are always desperately needed us.  Email us at KATYLIED2@AOL.COM if you are interested in donating or for information on fostering.\n \nFAQ:  For information regarding our organization, as well as adoption policies and practices, please visit our Petfinder Home Page at WWW.NORTHERNLIGHTS.PETFINDER.COM.\n \n \nNOTICE:  In the vast majority of cases, the dogs in our program and rescued from shelters, and Northern Lights has no means by which to collect or verify a dog's history.  We work in concert with our veterinarians, and breed and age estimates are based on a combination of professional input and our collective experience.  Our policy with information acquired prior to acceptance and while the dogs are in our care is that of \"full disclosure\".  It is our goal to ensure the adopter has all available information to ensure the best possible match between the dog and the adopter(s).  If we have identified a behavioral or health condition while the dog is in our care and custody, every effort will be made to correct it prior to adoption, OR the adopter will be made aware of the issue or condition prior to adoption.  Northern Lights' screening process is designed to identify only those adopters who are willing, and have the means, to treat conditions which may occur after adoption, and the adopter will be contractually responsible for doing so. However, Northern Lights' policy is to accept any adopted dog back into the program, at any time, for any reason.\n",

I'm looking for a patient family who will give me the opportunity to adjust to my new home. Once I warm up to you, I'm a total sweet heart who likes to cuddle and play. I would do best in a home that offers me encouragement and positive reinforcement; Make sure to bring the whole family in to meet me if you're interested. I can't wait to find the perfect family who will help me blossom!\n\nFrom: Owner Surrender\nWeight: 35 lbs\nExercise: medium to high energy\nLarge/Small dogs: I don't mind hanging out with other dogs. Please bring in your dog(s) to visit with me.\nChildren: I'd do best with older children. Please bring the whole family in to visit. \nCats/other small animals: My previous owner said that I was around cats in my previous home and did fine. You can always ask an adoption counselor to do a cat test with me. \n\n\n*HHHS Behavior Team will consult with you about my behaviors around strangers and in new environments. * Primary Color: Black Weight: 35.2lbs Age: 1yrs 6mths 2wks Animal has been Spayed",

            "description": "My name is Ella, and I'm the perfect combination of energy and cuddles. I may be 7 years old, but I am still active and like to play for those who like a more active lifestyle. On the flip side, I'm very good at relaxing at home and snoozing on the sofa. \nI currently live in a home with two other older dogs. We have all gotten along fine once we were slowly introduced. You see, I can get a bit nervous with new situations and dogs I don't know, so I'd do best with someone who is patient and can help me gain more confidence. My foster mom says I'm extremely well behaved at home and very much house trained. I walk well on a leash most of the time...I love walks...and I can get a little excited and pull when I see another dog, squirrel or deer. I've been working on controlling my excitement, and I need someone to continue to help me with this.\nAccording to my previous owner, I've lived in only one home since I was a puppy, so all this change is new for me. Sometimes it can be scary, but I'm a pretty happy girl most of the time. I like to be with my people rather being left alone, so I'd do best if I wasn't left alone for long periods of time. If you think you might have the right home for me, please contact my foster mom at ncfosterdoggies@gmail.com. I have a lot of love to give and just want someone to love me like crazy!

Zeke is a big boy, full of energy and typical puppy behavior, but very easy to redirect. For a young pup, he is well-behaved and listens pretty well. Zeke is potty trained, will let you know when he needs to go out, is crate trained, does well over night as well as for a few hours at a time during the day. He knows basic commands such as sit, shake and down. Zeke is getting close to perfecting rolling over. He enjoys walks and is pretty hilarious watching because he has this very cute prance when he walks. Zeke interacts and plays well with the foster resident dog. He might be a little too exciteable for smaller children because he is so playful, but definitely with supervision and training will be able to overcome that.  \n\nGet your apps in for Zeke at rescueapittie.org",

I tested positive for heart-worm, but I have had all my treatments and medications done I just have one more shot on the 13th then after that I will just need heart guard once a month for the rest of my life. Besides having heart-worm I am a healthy happy guy who is looking for a furrever home.\nI am a very energetic excitable guy who loves to play and go for walks. I do tend to mark my territory a lot so I would need some training to stop doing that.\nI was walked through the cat room here at the shelter and it is not 100% for sure because there is a glass door between us, but I did not mind the cats so if you have cats in the home that is fine with me.\nI am picky on other dogs so please make sure to bring any other dog you have in the home to come meet with me to make sure we would get along.\nI get along with children so any kiddos in the home to play with is okay with me.\nMy adoption fee is $185 with a qualified application.\nIf you'd like to put an application in for me you can do so at the shelter website Stephenmemorial.org and once it has been qualified you will get a call to set up an appointment to meet with me.",

            "description": "Olive is a 1-2 year, 29lb small mixed breed. We think there might be some lab, beagle and terrier in there! Olive LOVES to snuggle with her humans and is especially taken with her 7 year old 'sister.' She enjoys snuggling on couches, beds, chairs, ANYWHERE! She appears to be medium-high velcro and forms a quick attachment to her humans. She is very sweet and loves to give and receive affection.\n\nOlive can be very high-energy and loves to play with her foster family's other dog. They both love to roll around, chase each other, and run in the yard. Olive is learning how to walk on a leash and is showing interest in playing fetch. She is a more dominate dog and tends to boss the other dog around from time to time.\n\nOlive is not completely housebroken yet but she is close! She does well at night and is able to sleep through the night in a crate without any accidents.\n\nOlive is nervous in new situations and would do best with another dog in her home to give her confidence and a family that provides structure. Once she is comfortable in a new place, she happily gives kisses and tail wags. Olive needs a home with a yard and a family that is patient as she gets her bearings in a new place. She is spayed, up to date on vaccines and eager to find a family to love! \n\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $350 which includes routine vetting and spay/neuter. \n\nFor more information, please contact khasse@petconnectrescue.org\n\n**If you're viewing this on Petfinder, please visit www.petconnectrescue.org to complete our non-binding application.**",

            "description": "Hi, my name is Barney! I'm estimated to be a Hound mix born around 4/9/2019. I came up to Wisconsin from Texas and weigh close to 54 pounds. I was adopted as a puppy and brought back because I was becoming aggressive with the other dog in the home.  I am a dog that will do best with positive reinforcement training as I have bitten people before when spoken to and stared at harshly.  Since coming back to the shelter, I have loved everyone here.  I was great with the vet and I have wonderful manners.  I keep my kennel clean and make human friends easily.  I have the capability of being a wonderful dog but I do react when I feel threatened.  Obedience classes for adult dogs and puppies can be incredibly helpful for both animals and humans. It helps you understand what makes me tick and will give me a better idea of what you want me to do. It\u2019s a win/win and it will also strengthen the bond between us! Apply for me today!\n\nMy adoption fee is $60.00. Adoption applications can be filled out at CCHS or online through our website, www.cchs-petshelter.org. Applications are not first come, first served. All applications will be reviewed by the adoption committee and the home chosen will be the one considered to be the best match. All dogs and puppies have been vaccinated for Distemper and Bordetella, dewormed and microchipped. If old enough, they will be vaccinated for Rabies and blood tested for Heartworm, Lymes, Anaplasmosis and Erlichiosis. Dogs and puppies will be spayed or neutered before adoption.\n\nCCHS is proud to be a No-Kill Humane Society. As a private, non-profit charity, our work depends on donations and volunteers to keep going. We are committed to helping the animals that enter our doors and finding each the best possible forever home. CCHS has been inspected and licensed by the Department of Animal Health - DATCP. Our license is #268235-DS",

Please email the completed application to newleashrescue2018@gmail.com\n\n**Adoptable only as a pair with Harley**\n\nRiggs is estimated to be around two and a half years old old.  He is estimated to be a Cane Corso mix.  He was found with Harley, completely emaciated, after being dumped from someone's vehicle in a park.    A good samaritan saw this happen, and helped to get both dogs to safety.      When Riggs was found, he weighted less than 60 pounds, but has been able to put on weight and looks much better.  \n\nRiggs is good with other dogs, as long as there isn't food involved.  He will growl too if he thinks another dog is trying to take it away, so he is used to being fed in a kennel.    If another dog in the household has food that they are eating, they needs to be in a kennel until they are done.     If you were starved like they were, you can't blame them for feeling like they need to protect their food.  Hopefully this will go away in time with consistency of food and a stable environment, but kennel feeding may be needed long term.   Riggs has not shown any protectiveness around items with his foster mom. \n\nRiggs is the shy guy and was very scared at first.  He stayed mostly to his kennel or venturing a small area around.  He is very unsure of slippery floors and wood steps.  It has taken him quite awhile to come around to using the stairs to go outside in his foster home.  At first he was using some potty pads, but is now going outside to do his business since he's more comfortable.   Riggs is going to need patience and understanding, and a refresher on house training in a new home.    \n\nHe is currently living with a fenced yard.  If other dogs are in the home, Riggs will do best with females, and submissive males.    \nDue to the resource protection, we do not want to place Harley or Riggs in a home with young kids. Kids recommended age 10 and up.   They also need to have a fenced in yard.  They have not been cat tested. \n\nHarley has a wonderful connection to Riggs.  They will lay together, and she will lick and clean him.   We want them to stay together.  \n\n\nAdoption fee is $600/pair + tax (no checks)\n\nFoster to contact: Katie  @ kit_n_caboodle22@hotmail.com\n\n\nOur fosters do the best they can to provide all information about the animal's background and temperament while in foster care in their home. An adopters routine and home environment is likely going to be different than that in their foster home. \n\nSometimes there is more that comes out about a dog's personality once they have been able to settle in a home and truly become comfortable. There are great articles out there written about the different stages a pet goes through after adoption, discussing transitions that happen at 3 days, 3 weeks, and 3 months. We highly recommend reading about this - it will help you understand the transition your new pet goes through.",

He is working on leash training and is completely house broken. Because he likes getting all the attention, he may be best fit in a home as the only pet. Ollie is very sweet and likes to sleep in bed with his human. He absolutely loves human interaction and belly rubs are his favorite. He is an awesome dog but would do best if he can burn some energy each day. He will require a home with a 6 ft privacy fence. \n\nFor adoption please complete an online adoption application on our website, www.spcaeasttx.com",

            "description": "Mylie ? \nThis sweet lady joined our group when her incontinence was a little too much to handle with the new baby in the house. She is a beautiful 3 year old purebred lab. Unfortunately she has some incontinence issues and is on 2 medications for life for this. The cost is around $100 per month. She does not need to be one any special food though. \nHere is a little about her from her foster family:\nVery affectionate - loves belly rubs and snuggles, she\u2019ll even crawl under the blankets if you let her in the bed. She gets along great with other dogs but does not like to share toys, not aggressive just doesn\u2019t like to share. LOVES tennis balls and any toy that squeaks. She\u2019ll play fetch all day long, will destroy/rip apart plus/stuffed toys as well as tennis balls.  Enjoys water and can dock jump. She\u2019s attentive to guns and doesn\u2019t seem afraid (unsure if she will hunt or not). Knows how to use doggy door - we feel that this has really helped her and would be a big plus for a future home.\n Is trained on open bowl feeding. \nUnsure of how she would be with children.\nPretty good with taking her pills - she likes peanut butter. Fairly obedient. Knows sit, stay, here, heal, lay down, and roll over.\nWe believe she would be best with an active family. She has an endless amount of energy and needs the opportunity to be active. Any situation where she could go outside at her leisure would be best to help with her urinary incontinence.\nAdoption fee $300\nAdoption Applications available at rpaw.org",

            "description": "Curtis is about two-years old, around 60 lbs. He was a stray that showed up at a families home and he could have stayed but was stealing all the neighbor's packages. He is a very loving dog, wants to be a big lap dog. He is quite striking in appearance, good with dogs and cats. His special need is that he has tested positive for heartworms and starts his treatment on 20 Jan so will be available for adoption by the end of February. KEEP YOUR DOGS ON HEARTWORM PREVENTION PLEASE!\n\nADOPTION FEES Dogs & Puppies.....$100.00 . This Adoption fee includes: mandatory spay/neuter which will be done before you can take your dog or puppy home with you; basic canine immunizations (DHPP-CPV & Bordatella Intranasal); de-wormings; one-year rabies vaccination if old enough; heartworm test if over five months old; microchip from 24-Pet Watch; certificate for free health examination at your participating veterinarian; and a goodie bag chocked full of information, toys, and more.\nThe first step to do an adoption is to do our Adoption Application here: https://www.elmorehumane.org/adoption-application-online-form2.html\nIMPORTANT - we respond to your emailed applications and queries via email back to you. Please make sure you have either added our email (hselco@bellsouth.net) to your contact list or that you routinely check your SPAM folder for our response just to be safe. If we do not receive a timely response we simply move on to another applicant.\nYes, there are sometimes exceptions to our normal fee for older dogs or special cases. Some of our pets have also been lovingly sponsored by caring people and we will let the approved adopter know about that at the point of adoption. Visit our Website at: http://www.elmorehumane.org The staff would also like to remind you that for faster response to inquiries about adoptable animals to have the animals ID#, name & description. This way your questions will be answered in a timely manner.\nAll pet adoption websites & our shelter management software require that we choose a primary and/or secondary breed for our dogs. While our staff is quite breed knowledgeable, in many cases we are truly making our best guesses as to their breed(s) based on many factors but cannot promise that what we have said is accurate. So taking into account your own parameters for things such as size, coat care, activity level, etc please come and get to know our dog(s) as individuals to see if their personalities and yours are a forever match.\nPhone: (334) 567-3377 Fax: (334) 567-8774 E-mail: hselco@bellsouth.net",

Please email the completed application to newleashrescue2018@gmail.com\n\n**Adoptable as a pair with Riggs**\n\nHarley is estimated to be around a year and a half old.  She is maybe a Cane Corso/Pitbull mix.  She was found with another male dog, completely emaciated, after being dumped from someone's vehicle in a park.    A good samaritan saw this happen, and helped to get both dogs to safety.      When Harley was found, she weighed well under 40 pounds.  Now she is up to almost 45# currently.  \n\nHarley is good with other dogs, as long as there isn't food involved.  She likes to chew on nylabones and will growl too if she thinks another dog is trying to take it away from her.   If another dog in the household has food that they are eating, Harley needs to be in a kennel until they are done.  \n\nShe is fine with her foster mom taking things away.   If you were starved like her, you can't blame her for feeling like she needs to protect things.   As she has gotten more comfortable, she will even romp, play, and chase with other dogs outside.   \n\nShe was very shy at first but was the first to warm up and venture around and learn the stairs.   At first she was using some potty pads, but is now going outside to do her business since she's more comfortable.    She is currently living with a fenced in yard.     Harley will be very shy and scared in new situations and will need time to warm up.   \n\nDue to the resource protection, we do not want to place Harley or Riggs in a home with young kids. Kids recommended age 10 and up.   They also need to have a fenced in yard.  They have not been cat tested. \n\nHarley has a wonderful connection to Riggs.  They will lay together, and she will lick and clean him.   We want them to stay together.  \n\n\nAdoption fee is $600/pair + tax (no checks)\n\nFoster to contact: Katie  @ kit_n_caboodle22@hotmail.com\n\nOur fosters do the best they can to provide all information about the animal's background and temperament while in foster care in their home. An adopters routine and home environment is likely going to be different than that in their foster home. \n\nSometimes there is more that comes out about a dog's personality once they have been able to settle in a home and truly become comfortable. There are great articles out there written about the different stages a pet goes through after adoption, discussing transitions that happen at 3 days, 3 weeks, and 3 months. We highly recommend reading about this - it will help you understand the transition your new pet goes through.",

            "description": "Dorothy is ten years old and about 45 lbs. She was abandoned in pitiful condition and her foster mom has worked diligently bringing her back to health. She is simply a wonderful gal that loves everyone and everything. She does have some significant special needs though as she has Cushings but is doing very well on her Vetoryl meds. AND she has heartworms but has started Advantage Multi instead of a full immiticide treatment (talk to your Vet if this is not familiar to you). She is housetrained, walks wonderfully on a leash, is great with other dogs of all sizes and both sexes, is good with cats. She eats in her crate but prefers sleeping in the bed with her human. She is perfect in the house. Now FYI - Dorothy drinks a LOT of water, a LOT. This is the Cushings but she does not need to 'go' all of the time and has stayed inside for four hour stretches with no problem. But more than that would likely not be good for her and what we really want for her is a home with someone at home most of the time so she is never parked in a back yard. This girl is worth it and she deserves of a soft bed and lots of love for the rest of her life with some play time & nice long walks. Dorothy is a very special lady indeed!\nThis is from Dorothy's foster mom:\nDorothy is the easiest foster dog I have ever had. What a sweet girl, good with my cats, dogs and all the people she meets. I haven't seen her around children but I can't imagine that would be a problem, nothing reactive or snappy about this girl. She is quiet and very good in the house, but has plenty of energy to play when we go outside. She loves walks and walks well on a leash, perfectly fine with riding in the car. She barks once to let me know she needs to go out and again to let me know it's time to come in so she is also a good communicator! Please consider adding Dorothy, a very special senior dog, to your family.\n\nADOPTION FEES Dogs & Puppies.....$100.00 . This Adoption fee includes: mandatory spay/neuter which will be done before you can take your dog or puppy home with you; basic canine immunizations (DHPP-CPV & Bordatella Intranasal); de-wormings; one-year rabies vaccination if old enough; heartworm test if over five months old; microchip from 24-Pet Watch; certificate for free health examination at your participating veterinarian; and a goodie bag chocked full of information, toys, and more.\n\nThe first step to do an adoption is to do our Adoption Application here: https://www.elmorehumane.org/adoption-application-online-form2.html\n\nIMPORTANT - we respond to your emailed applications and queries via email back to you. Please make sure you have either added our email (hselco@bellsouth.net) to your contact list or that you routinely check your SPAM folder for our response just to be safe. If we do not receive a timely response we simply move on to another applicant.\nYes, there are sometimes exceptions to our normal fee for older dogs or special cases. Some of our pets have also been lovingly sponsored by caring people and we will let the approved adopter know about that at the point of adoption. Visit our Website at: http://www.elmorehumane.org The staff would also like to remind you that for faster response to inquiries about adoptable animals to have the animals ID#, name & description. This way your questions will be answered in a timely manner.\nAll pet adoption websites & our shelter management software require that we choose a primary and/or secondary breed for our dogs. While our staff is quite breed knowledgeable, in many cases we are truly making our best guesses as to their breed(s) based on many factors but cannot promise that what we have said is accurate. So taking into account your own parameters for things such as size, coat care, activity level, etc please come and get to know our dog(s) as individuals to see if their personalities and yours are a forever match.\nPhone: (334) 567-3377 Fax: (334) 567-8774 E-mail: hselco@bellsouth.net",

She gets along with other dogs and cats and loves to snuggle! She loves going on walks and she LOVES a treat now and again. She enjoys just hanging out on the couch too. She is completely house trained, has a wonderfully sweet disposition and has been great to have around. She is good with children too.\nAdoption Fee: $475.00\nWe are a Wisconsin state licensed dog rescue -WI# 402433\n\n***We do not have a central adoption center at this time. All our dogs are in private foster homes within WI. At this time we only place our dogs in areas of WI. The breed of our dogs is our best guess with the help of our veterinarians.\nOur Weight Classes are as follows:\n0- 25lbs - Small\n26- 45lbs - Medium\n46-89 - Large\n90+ X-large\nIf you are adopting an adult dog, which we consider 6 months of age or older, your adoption fee includes the following:\nSpay/Neuter, Rabies and Distemper shots, dewormed, flea & tick preventative, heartworm tested and microchipped.\nIf you are adopting a dog younger than 6 months of age, the dog will be up to date on the shots as per the dogs age. The dog will be dewormed, flea/tick preventative and microchipped. We only spay/neuter our dogs by 6 months of age. If you decide to adopt a younger dog than 6 months of age, they will need to be spayed/neutered at one of our preferred clinics. This will be determined by your contract along with the month they should have their surgery. This is included in your adoption fee.\nOnce you are approved with our rescue, you can meet any one of our dogs within the fosters home. If you are interested in the dog you met, you can take the dog home under our mandatory foster to adopt program. You receive 5 days to see if the dog is the right fit for your home.\nIf it is, we will conduct the home visit and finalize adoption. If it is not, it is returned to the foster. We are happy to find you another dog that meets your needs in your home.\nIf a dog is listed as PENDING, a family has met the dog and planning on adopting the dog after the home visit has been conducted. We always suggest sending in an application for a dog because there are times where the dogs are given back to us under the foster to adopt program. There are many reasons dogs are returned but normally it just was not the right fit for all.Please go to WWW.TAILWAGGERS911.COM under HOW TO ADOPT . We have an online application that is very easy to fill out. 2/2/21 5:21 PM",

            "description": "Hi my name is Cinch and I\u2019m about 5 months old. I\u2019m listed as a bird dog mix and a little over 20 lbs (I definitely need to gain some weight). I was a stray so I\u2019m continuing to learn to be in a home. My foster mom says I\u2019m a quick learner but I\u2019m definitely a typical puppy. I\u2019m still working on potty training. When my foster mom is home we go outside every two hours or so and that way I don\u2019t potty in the house. I\u2019m not a huge fan of how the snow makes my feet cold but I know to do my business right away. I\u2019m awesome in my crate. If you give me a few toys and some treats, I don\u2019t make a peep and I sleep through the night no problems. I even do great in the crate when my foster mom is at work. I love romping around with the resident dogs who are a lot bigger than me. I rarely bark unless I\u2019m trying to get the dogs to play with me. I don\u2019t understand why they bark at the window. I also met the cat, I\u2019m not quite sure about her, she kind of scares me so I just leave her be. I like to check on her now and again but she won\u2019t play with me. I love toys but I love nylabones (or any other durable toy) the best! When I get tired, I love to snuggle up with my foster mom. Laps are my favorite!\n \nI\u2019m still working on some things.  I eat my food way too fast. But I\u2019m doing great using a slow feeder. I still need to work on taking treats gently. I can take training treats gently, but I\u2019m too excited to get high value treats that I forget I\u2019m supposed to be gentle. They are just so good I can\u2019t help myself. I also get so excited when playing and giving kisses that sometimes I forget that I\u2019m not supposed to use my teeth.\n\nIf you would like to be considered as a potential adopter for one of our great dogs, please go to our website- www.luckymuttsrescue.org and submit an application. Our application process includes landlord approval and vet checks. Please make sure all of your information is current and accurate, including a valid email address and phone numbers. Inaccuracies and/or incomplete data will delay and/or cancel your application.  We strive to process all applications in a timely manner, but with the high volume of applications we are receiving, it is taking anywhere from 1-3 weeks.  You may be contacted via email if there are concerns or questions.  Once all of your information is reviewed and if your application is approved, you will be notified via email.  Submitting an application and receiving an approval does not guarantee you will be adopting the dog you applied for.  Once you move to the meet and greet process, you will be contacted by the foster family to further discuss the dog, and answer questions you may have, and if applicable, a meet and greet will be set up at our adoption center.   Meet and greets are only set up with approved applicants, and we require all members in the household to be present, as well as any current dogs in the home. \n\nCurrent Adoption Fees Are:\n$400+tax for puppies to 3 years old\n$350+tax for ages 4-7\n$250+tax for ages 8 and up\nBonded pairs vary\n\nThe adoption fee covers spay/neuter, up to date age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, general deworming, heartworm test, (if over 6  months) and a certified veterinary inspection. Please be aware, listed dog breeds are based on information provided and cannot be guaranteed.  Submitting an application for a particular dog does not guarantee that you will be the applicant chosen, we receive several applications for each dog. Our adopters are picked based on the needs of the dog, and the home we feel with best fit based on your responses to our application, vet information and landlord requirements.   Approved applicants not chosen for the dog you applied for, will be in active status for a period of six months.  We encourage you to watch Petfinder, Facebook and our website for upcoming dogs.  Should you see a dog that interests you, please send us a Facebook message or an email with your approval number.  Please be patient with us, as Lucky Mutts Rescue is run strictly by volunteers and many of us work full time jobs, have families and also foster dogs. Thank you for considering Lucky Mutts Rescue for your next furry family member!",

She was a loving, attentive momma who is now ready for her chance to find a home of her own. Summer is full of sunshine and warmth! She is very affectionate and is an incredibly sweet and gentle girl.Don\u2019t let her size fool you, this lady is super friendly and will just melt into you! Summer is looking for a family that will spoil her like she deserves.\n\nSummer and Sunshine, these remarkable sisters, were rescued by STARS when they were found wandering the roads in the backcountry of Georgia. Summer was named after the country town where she was found, abandoned and wandering the streets. It was very clear that Summer was extremely pregnant and under fed. She was happy to find a safe, warm, loving environment with STARS  to give. She gave birth to 8 beautiful, healthy puppies shortly after. Now that both of these sisters puppies have been adopted,Summer is ready to make her debut! Summer has regained her strength with lots of love in the process, and is finally ready to find her furever home. Summer deserves the world and we know that we will be able to find a family that can give that to her.\n\nClick on www.starsrescue.org to complete an application to be pre-approved to adopt this pup. As you can imagine, we get a lot of interest in our rescues and kindly ask that you are patient with us while we review applications as it may take a  few days.We will contact you regarding your application, during which you can ask more questions about this specific pup. If pre-approved we will coordinate a date for meet and greet.\n\nOur adoption fee is $500. This includes spay/neuter, microchipping, deworming, and all age-appropriate vaccinations.",

Funny story actually I came to Wisconsin making everyone believe I was a  boy but I\u2019m actually a girl! I love love love to play in the snow and just lick the snow away all day. I\u2019ve also been told I listen very well. I go potty outside and sit when I\u2019m told especially if there\u2019s a T-R-E-A-T involved. My least favorite thing to do is go in my crate but I only cry sometimes when I have to go in it. I\u2019m still not sure what this leash thing their talking about really is but my foster mom says I\u2019m adjusting nicely to it. All in all I love to play outside or take a nice long nap on the couch. I\u2019m pretty go with the flow and love all my resident dog siblings. At 6 months I\u2019m a very smart girl who loves to please my humans.\n\nIf you would like to be considered as a potential adopter for one of our great dogs, please go to our website- www.luckymuttsrescue.org and submit an application. Our application process includes landlord approval and vet checks. Please make sure all of your information is current and accurate, including a valid email address and phone numbers. Inaccuracies and/or incomplete data will delay and/or cancel your application.  We strive to process all applications in a timely manner, but with the high volume of applications we are receiving, it is taking anywhere from 1-3 weeks.  You may be contacted via email if there are concerns or questions.  Once all of your information is reviewed and if your application is approved, you will be notified via email.  Submitting an application and receiving an approval does not guarantee you will be adopting the dog you applied for.  Once you move to the meet and greet process, you will be contacted by the foster family to further discuss the dog, and answer questions you may have, and if applicable, a meet and greet will be set up at our adoption center.   Meet and greets are only set up with approved applicants, and we require all members in the household to be present, as well as any current dogs in the home. \n\nCurrent Adoption Fees Are:\n$400+tax for puppies to 3 years old\n$350+tax for ages 4-7\n$250+tax for ages 8 and up\nBonded pairs vary\n\nThe adoption fee covers spay/neuter, up to date age appropriate vaccinations, microchip, general deworming, heartworm test, (if over 6  months) and a certified veterinary inspection. Please be aware, listed dog breeds are based on information provided and cannot be guaranteed.

Our adopters are picked based on the needs of the dog, and the home we feel with best fit based on your responses to our application, vet information and landlord requirements.   Approved applicants not chosen for the dog you applied for, will be in active status for a period of six months.  We encourage you to watch Petfinder, Facebook and our website for upcoming dogs.  Should you see a dog that interests you, please send us a Facebook message or an email with your approval number.

Sunshine is an approximately  2.5year old, famle, hound mix who is looking for her forever family. She is very sweet with a calm demeanor. Sunshine is very loving, affectionate, and looking for a family to provide warmth to this winter! She truly has a heart of gold. With Sunshine around, your days will always be bright!\n\nSummer and Sunshine, these remarkable sisters, were rescued by STARS when they were found wandering the roads in the backcountry of Georgia. It was very clear that Summer was extremely pregnant and under fed. She was happy to find a place to give birth to her young. But this story isn\u2019t about Summer, her sister Sunshine needed a bit more coaxing. It took several weeks for STARS founder Willene to gain Sunshine\u2019s  trust and eventually perseverance won and Sunshine was rescued.  Little did we know Sunshine was also newly pregnant and was just using her mother instinct to make sure STARS was safe. Sunshine gave birth to three cuddly puppies on March 21, 2020. After a few months of regaining her strength with lots of love in the process, Sunshine is finally ready to find her furever home. Sunshine deserves the world and we know that we will be able to find a family that can give that to her.\n\nClick on www.starsrescue.org to complete an application to be pre-approved to adopt this pup. As you can imagine, we get a lot of interest in our rescues and kindly ask that you are patient with us while we review applications as it may take a  few days.We will contact you regarding your application, during which you can ask more questions about this specific pup. If pre-approved we will coordinate a date for meet and greet.\n\nOur adoption fee is $500. This includes spay/neuter, microchipping, deworming, and all age-appropriate vaccinations.",

            "description": "Meet Ellie! This sweet senior is looking for her furever family and home!\n\nEllie is estimated to be between 8-10 years old and she has been through a lot in those years. Shortly after being found about 2 months ago in rural Virginia (abandoned, emaciated, and tied to a tree\n\n), she was diagnosed with diabetes. Her diabetes had been left untreated for so long that she developed cataracts, making her mostly blind. There is also evidence that she was shot at some point in her life\n\n.\n\nDespite everything humans have put her through, Ellie is very outgoing and loves nothing more than snuggling up and meeting new people! She moves around well using her nose\n\nand ears\n\n. She did well with 2 dogs that are laid back like she is, but she's not fond of cats.\n\nEllie is spayed, microchipped, up to date on vaccinations, and house trained. Please consider opening your heart and home to this loving, sweet, deserving girl!\n\nOur best guess is she is a min pin mix. She currently weighs about 20 lbs. and is slowly putting weight back on now that we seem to have gotten her diabetes under control, and still need to gain a few lbs. as you can see from her after pic.\n\nTo be considered to adopt Ellie, please submit our Dog/Puppy Adoption Application as this is the FIRST step in our process: https://form.jotform.com/203643479832159\n\nNOTE: we are a foster-based rescue in Southeastern Pennsylvania which means we don't have a physical location (our sanctuary is for our farm animals only). We only set up meets for approved applicants and you must be located within 2 hours of Philadelphia.",

            "description": "Name: Albert\nNicknames: Alb. Albs.\nBreed: Spaniel/Pointer/Hound Mix\nAge: ~ 1 Year\nWeight: 23 lbs.\nBefore OMD: Albert and 15 other dogs were rescued from a horrific hoarding situation by one of our partner rescues when they were notified that the dogs were alone, starving, and living outside in filth and squalor. Despite knowing the conditions and one of the dogs being found deceased on a mound of trash, local officials said to \"let nature take its course.\" Obviously, that wasn't an option for our partner rescue and OMD stepped up for Albert and three of his siblings.\nEnergy Level: Medium. Happy to cuddle and chill on the couch but also loves to run around outside like a wild man when the opportunity presents itself.\nHis Role Model: Scaredy Squirrel (totally worth a Google search)\nFight or flight? Flight. He's a lover not a fighter and not a fan of any type of confrontation. He is extremely shy when meeting new people, but if it\u2019s done in a quiet place with some treats, he comes around.\nToy rating: 10/10. So awesome. Best invention ever. Highly recommended. Optimal for throwing around, chasing, carrying multiple in mouth, showing them off, and hoarding.\nHis other favorite things: Dog friends. Melting into the couch. \nWhat we love about him: His kind, loving and gentle temperament. How his confidence level increases he's carrying one of his prized possessions in his mouth. His passion for collecting things...toys, shoes, articles of clothing, thingamabobs...it's all very Arielle-esque, really. How special he makes you feel when you gain his trust and he cozies up to you for cuddles. \nFoodie Status: Big foodie! If the coast is clear and things are quiet, he\u2019ll even accept snacks from strangers!\nSelfish or happy to share: He\u2019ll share anything. A good snoozle spot, his toys, his food, his treats.\n2021 New Year\u2019s Resolution: Gain a bit more confidence and a forever family!\nKids: Kiddos 10+ are ideal for this guy. He's afraid of his own shadow so a Brady Bunch style home will give him a heart attack. \nDogs: Mandatory. Albert perks up immediately when there is another pup around and he looks to them for cues when scoping out new situations. We will not accept applications that do not have other dogs in the home.\nCats: Sure. Currently fostered with them. May bark initially (um, cats can be scary at first), but then settles in just fine. \nCommands: Well, nothing...yet. He\u2019s a blank slate and ready to learn!\nHousetrained: Working on it and doing well with a consistent schedule.\nCrate trained: Yep! Has been a great potty training tool and he is happy to sleep in his crate through the night.\nEmotional Cliff Notes: Albert needs a family that will give him time and patience so he can bloom into the wonderful family dog he is on the inside. Slow and steady will win the race (and his love).\nAlbert is neutered, vaccinated, heartworm negative and microchipped. He\u2019s available to residents of CT and surrounding states. If you are interested in adopting, please complete an application from omdrescue.org.",

Little ones make me nervous and I am looking for a home without young children. Children ages 8+ may be a better fit for me if there are any. I have been described as a sweet and friendly genteman. I am strong on a leash and will need an adopter who can help me learn some leash training. I love to be close to my people and will lean into you for affection. I take treats nicely from your hand and will trade you my toys for treats! *Please apply on our website at indy.gov/activity/adopt-a-pet. Go to the website, click on the adoption application link, enter the information and hit submit. After the application is submitted a staff member will contact you within 48 hours. Thank you for your interest in adopting one of our FABULOUS PETS! We hope to see you soon, The IACS Adoptions Team.",

Pacho can sometimes be protective of his people but otherwise shows no signs of aggression.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis sweet boy just wants someone to love on.\u00a0He likes to play fetch and play with his toys, but would prefer not to hang out outside unless his people are with him.\u00a0Pacho is ready to show you just how much love he has to give...are you ready to accept it and give Pacho a loving home?\n\nInterested in adopting this dog? Visit our website (http://www.SecondCityCanineRescue.org) to fill out an application and to find out where this dog may be shown this weekend.\n\nWe love our dogs. We want happy lives for all of them and are looking for the home that provides the best fit for each dog\u2019s individual needs. Please understand that there may be multiple families interested in this dog. Come to the show to find out if this dog is the right fit for you \u2014 it's helpful to bring all family members and current dogs. \n\nAlso, please know that the breed mix listed is simply a guess. In most cases, we don\u2019t know their background. We encourage you to base your decision on individual personality and pet qualities instead of relying on our guess.\n\nPlease understand, we only adopt our animals out near the Chicagoland area. Questions? Email us at adoptions@sccrescue.org. Hope to see you become part of the SCCR family!",

She was nearly starved to death when we received her but no fault to her owners after extensive testing we discovered that Lexi had a condition called EPI this requires her to eat ONLY a specific prescription food and have digestive supplements put on her food before eating.   She CANNOT have any other food or treats.  Currently she is doing great and has put on the weight she requires and very content.  She will however need to be monitored by a vet to make sure all is ok.  We do recommend a fenced in yard but we also need someone who will not leave her alone in a yard(for fear of eating something she is not suppose to).  Although she requires special treatment she will repay it in lots of snuggles and love.   we are attaching a link about her condition.  Ideally we would love to find someone who has dealt with EPI or currently has a dog with the condition.   If you have any questions or would like information about Lexi please email\npifanimal@yahoo.com\n\n https://wagwalking.com/condition/exocrine-pancreatic-insufficiency\n\n",

I don't require much, just an animal free house with a loving family to spend my time with. Since I am a famous actor, I am good at taking direction. I love to sit and shake for treats.

They'll be adopted as a pair. \n\n- Friendly girl who can be independent at times \n\n- Knows come and would love to learn more \n\n- Has done well with other dogs and loves her buddy, Axel \n\n- Can pull hard on a leash right now (harness recommended for walking) \n\n- Prefers to eat her food in peace and needs to be fed separately from Axel and other dogs \n\n- Has been diagnosed with hip dysplasia - severe left side, moderate right side (more info at ARL) \n\nThe ARL's shelter software requires that we choose a primary breed for our dogs. Visual breed identification in dogs is unreliable, so for most dogs we are only guessing at primary breed. We get to know each dog as an individual and do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality, not breed label.\n\n Primary Color: Black Secondary Color: Tan Weight: 52.7lbs Age: 4yrs 1mths 2wks Animal has been Spayed",

Hound breeds are very prominent in the rural south and usually the first to be euthanized at the shelter due to the overpopulation of this breed.\n\nGood with: Dogs, Kids, Cats\n\nWinnie is the sweetest dog you will ever meet. She is so curious and kind and she greets everyone, human and dog alike, with a tail wag and a kiss. She does not bark, isn't high energy, doesn't chew, and isn't aggressive. She loves treats and is shy and sweet. She loves her crate and it's her safe place -- she sleeps in her crate with the door open every night. She does not like loud noises but will be assured quickly by her human companion and she's a great listener. She loves children. She is leash reactive so she needs a home outside of the city with a fenced in yard. She also is very overweight, so she's looking for a family who can help her shed a few lbs! She is just the best dog and can't wait to find her new forever home!\n\nAdoption Application: http://bit.ly/adoptrdr\nAdoption Application:\nhttp://bit.ly/adoptrdr\n\nFoster Application: http://bit.ly/fosterapprdr\n\nAdoption Process: In order to adopt, we require an adoption application. After you submit an application, if you pass the screening, we will contact you to schedule a phone interview. We will call your references, including your veterinarian and landlord (when appropriate). We will also conduct a home visit. After these steps are complete, you will be approved to adopt a dog. Please note this process takes 1-2 weeks so applications submitted when you are ready to bring a dog home within that time frame. You can meet our adoptable dogs at events, however, we cannot guarantee that dogs at events do not have pre-approved applicants meeting them there as well, so the application is the best way to start the process.\n\nMission Statement: Forever true to \"The Underdog\", Rural Dog Rescue is dedicated to saving the lives of dogs in shelters who are often overlooked for adoption or rescue. We save the dogs who are at most risk of being euthanized: the hounds, the black dogs, the seniors, the sick and the broken. We make a commitment to reserve a minimum of 50% of the dogs we save to The Underdog. Root For The Underdog!\n\nRural Dog Rescue's home base is in Washington, DC. We adopt to the Washington, DC metropolitan area to include Maryland and Northern Virginia.\n\nWe support several high kill shelters that euthanize in 72 hours and whose kill rate is 70% or higher in rural areas of Virginia, West Virginia, North and South Carolina. Rural Dog Rescue also helps dogs in need in Washington, DC and Maryland.\n\nWe are 100% volunteer and foster based and no salaries are paid. 100% of your donation and adoption fee goes to helping the dogs and cats of Rural Dog Rescue.\n\nAlthough we try to be as accurate as possible, Rural Dog Rescue cannot guarantee the breed or full-grown adult size of any of the dogs or puppies in its care. Because many of these dogs were found as strays or are the result of irresponsible, unplanned breeding, we do not know the dog's exact background and can only list breed and size by our best educated guess. If exact breed and size are important to you, please consider adopting a dog from a specific breed rescue. Our goal is for our dogs to be adopted by people who will love and care for them forever for who they are - no matter what breed and size they turn out to be!\n\nAll dogs go to their new homes spayed or neutered, up to date on all shots, dewormed (although a second deworming may be required), started on heartworm and flea and tick preventative and sometimes microchipped.\n2/2/21 1:19 PM",

            "description": "Hi!\u00a0My name is Coal and I\u2019m here to warm your heart! I am a three-month-old Pittie puppy full of life and love.\u00a0I am jet black with a luxurious, shiny coat and totally wonky ears. \u00a0\n\nI am a very quick learner, well on my way to being potty trained (I will signal you by running to the door and whimpering).\u00a0It helps that I am highly treat- and food-motivated. I love running in the yard and am learning fetch.\u00a0I take a few minutes to settle in my crate but am a good boy while you are gone and during the night.\u00a0Sometimes I even go in my crate to take a puppy nap after a hard morning of playing.\u00a0\n\nI like other big dogs and people, though I\u2019m timid at first. However, little people would probably not fare well with me because I am so energetic and may knock them over.\u00a0I am not very vocal.\u00a0I would do great with a playmate my (eventual) adult size.\u00a0Although I like small and senior dogs, I might be a little rambunctious for them.\n\nLike most puppies, I\u2019m still learning about inappropriate chewing, mouthiness, and leash manners. Please be patient with me! I\u2019m still very young.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a bright spark of energy and love, I\u2019m your guy! \n\nInterested in adopting this dog? Visit our website (http://www.SecondCityCanineRescue.org) to fill out an application and to find out where this dog may be shown this weekend.\n\nWe love our dogs. We want happy lives for all of them and are looking for the home that provides the best fit for each dog\u2019s individual needs. Please understand that there may be multiple families interested in this dog. Come to the show to find out if this dog is the right fit for you \u2014 it's helpful to bring all family members and current dogs. \n\nAlso, please know that the breed mix listed is simply a guess. In most cases, we don\u2019t know their background. We encourage you to base your decision on individual personality and pet qualities instead of relying on our guess.\n\nPlease understand, we only adopt our animals out near the Chicagoland area. Questions? Email us at adoptions@sccrescue.org. Hope to see you become part of the SCCR family!",

            "description": "Meet Scooby! This is a special dog. Not only is he majestic in appearances, he loves water, fetching balls, and cuddling!\n\nno small children or cats please! He is not aggressive towards small children but he's big and he lacks awareness of his size. So it is best to place him in a home that does not already have small children.\n\nScooby is a beautiful brindle boy, 3 years, approx 65 lbs. He is Potty trained and great in the house. Not destructive at all. Loves to chew on toys and balls. Has energy but settles in the house too with a toy. He is not reactive at all to other dogs. Nor is he aggressive. He may have some prey drive so no small dogs or cats. But he LOVES medium to large size dogs and loves to play with them!\nLoves car rides. Used to play ball in the back of my Honda with me while driving. He is a bit afraid at first of new people, but not aggressive at all. Doesnt bark and does great in the crate with toys. Does not whine. \n\nWe are crazy about him. Scooby loves loves to swim and play ball. He loves to lay on the float with you or fetch a ball\n\nout in the water. This boy is so special and silly and will keep you laughing all day.\n\nNo small children please because it will make him nervous, Totally fine with dogs his size.\n\nScooby needs a pit or big dog knowledgeable home. Scooby had a rough start and missed some socialization skills as a pup. He has come a long way in many areas but he still is anxious in new settings. He would do ok with another dog with calm confidence. Unfortunately as he settled in, some prey instincts started showing up and for the safety of their other animals (little dogs and cats) we have to rehome him. We will assist with anything he needs and help the transition as much as possible. He is neutered, up to date on all vetting, crate trained, not at all destructive and loves to snuggle on the couch with you.\n\nPlease contact Michelle with your questions, michellelMFTLPC@gmail.com\n\nThe adoption fee is $400. He is up to date on vaccines according to age, has received proper deworming, and comes with additional dewormer if needed. This pet is microchipped, spayed/neutered, comes with 6 months of Heartworm preventative, and one month free trial of pet insurance if registered by adopter with insurance company. All animals receive a health certificate (stating that a licensed veterinarian saw the pet and deemed it healthy for travel, but is not a promise of perfect health.) Our transports are USDA certified and the cost of transport is included in adoption fee!\n\nHe/she may currently be fostered in Houston, Tx but will be traveling to the PNW as soon as he/she finds her perfect home or may be traveling to a foster in the PNW soon. \n\nApplication link: https://petstablished.com/adoption_form/19753/generic\n\nPlease go to our website to see more about our rescue and what we do! We are very proud of our hard work in saving as many animals as we can, giving them what they need, and matching them with the right families.",

We will temperament test him with other dogs at a later date when he has had more time to adjust to shelter life.\n\nZane is currently a resident at Vermilion Parish Animal Control.

We got Noelle on Christmas day out of Louisiana after her owners were threatening to shoot her because they needed her gone immediately.\n\nNoelle is about an 18 month old great Dane who is the definition of gentle giant. She is currently living in a circus of a Foster family that has 4 two-legged kids under the age of seven, three great Danes, cats, chickens, and goats! Noelle is perfect with all of them. She is attached at the hip to the second to youngest child, Harper, and sleeps in her bed at night. \n\nPrior to coming into rescue she lived a life outside, and because of that, she is heartworm positive and will need to remain on the rescue\u2019s slow kill ivermectin and doxycycline regimen for the next year. \n\nOnce in her foster home, she got the hang of everything almost immediately. And boy did she find a couch. She is very well mannered and willing to please. She could use some leash manners, they\u2019re still working on that. At first she was a little pushy about food, but now that she\u2019s been in foster care for a couple of weeks she understands that she\u2019s never going to go without and has relaxed. She is not a people food beggar, unlike the other Danes in the household. And a squirt bottle is the perfect solution to redirect her from anything unwanted.\n\nHer foster mom writes:\n\nNoelle is a sweet Dane who came to us out of Louisiana. She\u2019s playful and great with everyone including young kids, dogs, and cats. She can be shy at first, but quickly comes out of her shell in the presence of food and other dogs. We feel that she needs the companionship of another large dog to play with. She is very playful with a lot of energy to burn. A fenced in yard is a MUST for her. Noelle is also HW positive and will required continued treatment until she is negative. \n\nShe has been spayed, had a gastropexy and is up to date on all vaccinations and chipped.\n\nTo read over our adoption requirements and apply to adopt Noelle please go to www.nwflgdr.com/adopt.\n\nNoelle\u2019s adoption fee is $400. \n\nATTENTION: If you are applying from out of area or out of state, understand that if your application gets approved, you will be expected to pick up the dane in the location that he/she is being fostered. In addition, if the adoption does not work out, it is your responsibility to bring the dane safely back to us.",

All things in life seem to be new to him \u2013 and with continued encouragement, he is open to try them. \n? great walking, jogging, & biking partner\n? loves walking at the beach & the park, hanging out at the restaurant on the patio for lunch out with friends\n? jogging with the bike\n? pays zero attention to the 3 cats here in his foster home\n? spend hours playing fetch \u2013 tennis balls, floppy disc toy, stuffed animals with or without a squeaky, whatever you can throw for him\n? loves to snuggle & much prefers the bed with you than the crate without you!\nCharlie really doesn\u2019t pay attention to the foster mom's dog either, he\u2019s definitely a people-dog rather than a dog-dog. \n\nIf the animal is under the age of 3 years old or has health issues, a vet reference is required which means you must own a pet or have owned a pet in your name.\n\nAdoption fee of $275. covers all vetting including spay/neuter surgery, vaccines, microchip heartworm test and treatment if needed and any other medical that may be required while in rescue. \n\nWe only do adoptions on Saturday and not all animals are able to attend so if you would like to see a specific animal please let us know so that we can make arrangements for it to be present at the event. Event locations do vary so please check the homepage to find out where we will be this week. Please do not ask us to reduce adoption fees since all fees help us to cover medical expenses for all of our animals, some of which can be very expensive.  Saving lives is not cheap so thank you for your understanding and helping us save as many as possible.\n\nPlease email lowcountryanimalrescue@ymail.com for an application.",

            "description": "Courderoy came to us after he, his mom and brother were picked up by Animal Services running loose.  They were part of a family compound in which many dogs were in various conditions:  chained, in kennels and loose within a fenced area.  The people chose not to reclaim any of this sweet family which would have included fines for failure to have state required rabies vaccinations.  \n\nCourderoy and his family all have the same sweet temperament.  His mom Latte, now Penny graduated and is living a wonderful life with her family in Dallas Georgia.  His brother Oscar was adopted by a family in Canada where he enjoys frolicking in the snow.  \n\nCourderoy is a bulldog mixed with extra sweetness.  He is very friendly and loving.  He became a favorite at Riverbend, even with people who don't normally interact with our dogs.  \n\nCourderoy is 55 lbs, and heartworm negative.  He is housetrained, crate trained, although he prefers cuddling with his person.  He knows sit, down, go to your spot, stay, leave it, give, come, off, and wait (for food and at doors).  \n\nCourderoy is very loyal.  He loves to play ball and with anything that squeaks.  He enjoys a belly rub and considers that a reward for good behavior.  \n\nCourderoy does not like loud boisterous people (especially high pitched), jangling keys, moving carts and heavy chains.  Obviously brings back some bad memories of his prior life.  \n\nCourderoy has excellent house manners, is more of a couch potato than an athlete, although he does enjoy his playtimes in the fenced yard.  \n\n",

As soon as animals are adopted, they are moved to the Adopted Pets page so if they are still listed on the Adoptable Dogs or Cats page, they are still available. So keep any eye on the site for any animals being added as available for adoption as new animals are added everyday! We would recommend if you haven\u2019t done so already that you submit a general online adoption application with us so it is on file for when you are ready to come out and adopt. The adoption counselors will be able to show you many that would be a good fit for your family. Animal House Shelter can not guarantee breed or breed mix of our adoptable animals. The animals are posted on the website as a breed or breed mix based on their physical characteristics they most resemble. We also can not guarantee the ages of our adoptable animals or how large puppies will be when fully grown.\n\nPlease fill out an online adoption application. Visit our 'Adopt' page to view adoption process steps, policies, requirements and FAQ. View our 'Visit' page for hours and directions to our shelter.

            "description": "weight:  \nestimated age:  \n\nThese dogs are in the KENNEL at Small Miracles, you MUST apply IN PERSON\n\nPLEASE READ INFORMATION BELOW:\n\nThis dog recently arrived and is just settling in.  If you are interested in adopting,  YOU MUST COME IN PERSON during adoption hours and fill out an application.  Adoption hours and address are viewable on the website at www.smallmiraclesrescue.org\n\n\n---FAQ---\n\nIs This Dog Currently Available?... This dog is available at the Small Miracles rescue facility in Ellicott City.  To submit an application, please come meet this dog in person.  You can bring your application with you, or you can fill one out when you come in.  Dogs will be removed from PetFinder only when they have an approved application or more than three (3) interested applicants.\n\nWhere did this dog come from?...  We rescue dogs from 100% kill shelters in West Virginia and on occasion from Kentucky.  On rare occasions we accept owner surrenders.  Due to the nature of the shelters they were rescued from, we often do not know the dogs' history.\n\nHow Old is this dog?...  We look at a dogs' teeth to estimate its age, and then the age is reevaluated by our veterinary staff when the dog is spayed/neutered.  If an age is not posted online, please feel free to inquire.\n\nIs this dog Good With Kids?...  We occasionally know for sure if a dog is good with kids because it came from a home with kids.  This is rare.  We always suggest you bring your children in to meet the dog if you are seriously interested in adopting.  Dogs may like some kids and may dislike others.  Dogs are individuals, just like kids are.\n\nIs this dog Housebroken?...  Advice from a veterinarian:  Even if a dog is housebroken at my house, it does not mean that it understands not to pee at someone else's house.  It ONLY understands not to pee at my house.  Some dogs make the connection that they should only pee outside.  Some must be retrained when they come home.  All we can tell you for sure is whether/or not a dog's crate is clean when we come to walk them in the AM.  All this means is that they are crate trained and waited to pee until we took them outside.\n\nWhat is this dog's Temperament?...  We do not have a clear picture of a dog's temperament until we have allowed them to settle in for a few days.  Even then they are living in a shelter environment with many other dogs and a lot of daily activity.  It can be difficult to say a dog is \"calm\" or \"nervous\" when the shelter environment is playing a big role in that behavior.  We only rescue FRIENDLY dogs who have no known bite history.  If a dog is at Small Miracles, it likes people and has a good temperament.  We always suggest you meet the dog to see if it is the right fit for your lifestyle. \n\nWhat are your Fees?...  Base adoption fee is $325 for adult dogs and puppies.  To this, we add a $30 microchip fee, which we register for you, and a 6 month supply of heartworm preventative.  Heartworm preventative costs $40-60 depending on the weight of the dog.  This means that a large dog will total $405.00 and an extra large dog will total $415.00.\n\nWhy can't I adopt a FREE dog?...  Our adoption fee covers many procedures which cost much more for us then the amount we ask for from you. We spay/neuter all pets, and we give them their first round of vaccines (canine distemper, bordatella, Rabies if age appropriate).  At a typical vet clinic this would cost you $500 at minimum for the surgery, and each vaccine is roughly $35 each.  Even if your adopted dog does not have all of its shots due to the mandatory waiting period between booster shots, we offer vaccinations at the low cost of $20/shot.  We test all dogs for heartworm disease and tickborn illnesses such as Lymes.  We never euthanize a heartworm positive dog, and treatment routinely costs us $3000/dog.  We collect a fecal sample from every rescued dog and run a microscopic parasite test.  Any parasites found will be treated with two rounds of the appropriate dewormer.  We treat all dogs for fleas and ticks with Advantage.  If a dog has significant dental disease or \"very dirty teeth\", we will perform a dental cleaning when the dog has its spay/neuter surgery.  A dental cleaning with extractions would cost you upwards of $400-600 at your local vet clinic.\n\nALSO NOTE... Small Miracle is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization.  We survive off of our adoption fees and donations from the community.  We are a non-profit animal rescue and do not receive income from tax revenue as some county shelters do. \n\nFor more information including Adoption Hours and Rescue Address, please visit our website at www.smallmiraclesrescue.org",

Rusty has gone through and completed his heartworm treatment.   He will be joining AHR's pack on January 30th!  \n\nRusty is a typical lab in that he has a lot of energy.  He loves humans, gets along well with other dogs.  He does like to chase kitties, as he has found this to be a fun game.  Rusty is working on his manners.  He is learning not to jump and how to walk well on a leash.  He is house trained.  He is crate trained, but the longer he is in a crate the more energy he has built up!   He would enjoy a active family.  \n\n\nAdoption fees cover age specific vaccinations, spay/neuter, microchip, heartworm/lyme/ehrlichia test, worming and transport fees. \n\nAdoption fees: \nThrough 6 months of age $450; \n7 months to through 5 years $400; \n6 years and under 9 years $325: bonded pairs are $500; \n9 years and older $250: bonded pairs are $300 \n\nThis dog is available unless it is marked as Pending, meaning Pending Adoption. This dog is in foster care locally, ONLY if Maine or New Hampshire is listed next to the dogs name; otherwise, the dog is still waiting with our partner rescue for an adoption or foster home in New England. \n\nPLEASE NOTE - We will check your veterinary reference, to ensure that current and prior dogs have a history of being kept up to date on rabies and distemper, have had annual heartworm tests, and are on heartworm preventative at least 6 months of the year. Current pets must by spayed/neutered. \n\nImported dogs are transported on a USDA approved transport with a Health Certificate. All imported dogs are quarantined 14 days prior to getting on transport.\n",

His biggest goal in life is to figure out what you want him to do (and then do it), and when he succeeds, he celebrates by wiggling his entire body and nuzzling you to share his joy! His second biggest goal in life is to curl up beside you, mash his face into the side of your leg, and snore. \n\nBolt's idea of a perfect day is anything that involves being where you are, really, whether it's showing off good behavior on a leash or keeping an eye on you as he dozes. His curiosity and attentiveness help him adjust to new situations like a pro, as long as there's someone around for him to take cues from -- he's a fast learner! Bolt also already understands basic manners, so with a little encouragement, he could be picking up new tricks in no time. \n\nOne thing he doesn't need to learn how to do, though, is love you. He's already got that one down. Primary Color: Brindle Secondary Color: White Weight: 57.375lbs Age: 4yrs 2mths 3wks Animal has been Neutered",

I am an eager to please little girl and I am also a quick learner, as many things are still new to me! \n\nI have been able to settle into my daily routine at my foster home. I am a young girl and one of my favorite things to do is to take a nice, long, and energetic walk with you. I have had lots of practice walking with my leash and have been doing a great job so you are able to enjoy our walk too, don\u2019t you worry! \n\nI have been doing well with other dogs, as my foster family has three of them, and have learned so much already, such as when to potty and when dinner time is, which is always important! With that being said,  I could do especially well in a home with another dog who I could \u201clearn the ropes from\u201d. \n\nWhile I enjoy running and chasing my dog friends; it wouldn\u2019t take long until I was ready to snuggle right up next to you for a good face licking! Please ask to meet me if you are looking for a great companion and a \u201cfurrever\u201d friend; I promise, you won\u2019t be disappointed! \n\n\nApproximate Age:   1 year\nWeight:  42 pounds",

He is house/potty trained and walks well on a leash. His aim is to please his owner.\n\nWe feel he would be best suited with a female, no young children, and the only dog.\n\nThe only situation with Ezra is, he has a biting history, never bitten his person, but her friends. We feel this can be managed in different surroundings/ quieter home. You will also have to have experience with this dachshund behavior. A must!! Don\u2019t just look at him and think he\u2019s cute, there is that other side, that can land him in trouble.\n\nEzra\u2019s ideal situation would be a woman owner who no longer works outside the home, who will take him for daily walks, play with him in a fenced yard, have space to play fetch with him in the house, and have few if any, visitors. Crating him when a visitor arrives or when you need to do an errand, is imperative; crating relieves his anxiety over new situations, and ensures his comfort.\n\nAgain we are asking for a phone interview before filling out an application.",

They are awesome with kids of all ages and very dog friendly. They lost there home after owner losing hers. Ideally we wold love to see them go together if we can not find a home together they will need to go to homes with at least one other younger dog in the home. A large size dog no small dogs. Duke likes the company of his sister , they sleep together and play together so if not placed together we are looking for a simular situation for him. Awesome house manners and are crate trained when younger but when mom was at work they free roamed in the home. Very sweet and goofy ,soft temperaments. The love all people.www.azmastiffrescue.com",

They are awesome with kids of all ages and very dog friendly. They lost there home after owner losing hers. Ideally we wold love to see them go together if we can not find a home together they will need to go to homes with at least one other younger dog in the home. A large size dog no small dogs. Harley likes the company of her brother Duke , they sleep together and play together so if not placed together we are looking for a simular situation for her. Awesome house manners and are crate trained when younger but when mom was at work they free roamed in the home. Very sweet and goofy ,soft temperaments. They love all people.www.azmastiffrescue.com",

            "description": "This pupper originally landed at HSNBA in September of 2020 with a badly mangled leg. He got his leg amputated with our friends at Animal Medical Center and also found his new home. Sadly, he somehow ended up in a high kill shelter in Galveston and when AMC heard about THAT they went and picked him up! Now we are all working together to find a new FOREVER home! \nIs anyone looking for a high energy, beautiful pup?! He's only got 3 legs, but he's got more heart than most dogs. All he needs is someone who has the time and patience to train and work with him. He wants and deserves a good forever home!HSNBA lists all animals online from the moment of intake, and our listings are updated automatically every midnight. Some of these animals may not be available for adoption at this moment, but you can always call the shelter at 830-629-5287 for clarification on the adoption process or the animal's current status.",

As for other dogs, we feel it would be best if Brooklyn were the only dog in the house. She seems to have never learned how to interact with other dogs, so when she is around them she gets too worked up. Training would be a good thing for Brooklyn. It is important to note that during her evaluation, Brooklyn did have some issues when presented with a pig's ear. It seemed workable, and an experienced trainer could help teach her that there is no worry in high value treats being taken away. Brooklyn is the kind of girl who makes her presence known, but don't let her fool you, she is a real sweetheart.",
