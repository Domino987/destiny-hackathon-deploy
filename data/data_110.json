            "description": "Hank is a 2 year old, 70#, Black Lab/ Belgian Malinois mix with a white pagoda on his chest.   He is lively and full of fun, but too active for smaller children.  He is neutered, vaccinated, crate trained, and on his monthly heart worm/flea prevention.  He is healthy, happy, and loves tag with the other dogs.  He loves fetch, and is never far from his ball.  He will play fetch all day if you let him.  He prefers sleeping in a dog bed or on your bed at night.  Hank is looking for an inside home with an active family who has a fenced yard.\n\nTo make an appointment to meet this personable player, forward a pre-adoption application from the savealifepets.org site to jhtaylor551@gmail.com",

We were told they were amazing family members, in every sense of the word, to include living with other doggies. They were returned due to no fault of their own--their family had drastic life changes and had to reluctantly return them. They were adopted together a second time. Things did not go as well. They did not like-and would not stay- where they were put in the house and caused damage. They are laid back-but when they are not happy-they are like a slow, methodical bulldozer. (They are large dogs- approx 100lbs each.) They are friendly, good girls and volunteers love them. They will need an adopter who understands their need to be together and that they are a handful. There have been no issues with Camille and Caroline living with each other (food/treat issues or aggression to each other.) As a matter of fact, they often sleep in the same bed even though there are two in their kennel.

            "description": "Originally from a rural shelter, and now in COLORADO SPRINGS, CO, Bailey is an active 6-7 year old neutered male dog with lots of love to give the right family. He is so sweet! He loves to run and, with a little more training, could run beside a bike. Bailey can be a little reserved when he first meets you, but doesn't take long to warm up. He enjoys walks but really needs to run for more exercise. Bailey can be strong-willed, so continuing obedience training is a must! Bailey is mellow, a cuddler and a kisser, and always wants to be by your side. He is crate trained, has good house manners and likes car rides. There are no birds in the backyard, because he chases them off; he does not do well with cats. Bailey enjoys watching over his family and house from a deck or porch during the day and capturing your bed at night. Bailey needs a home with another dog for company and romping, and at least a 5 ft. fence for security. For more information, contact Jeannine at jeannine@dalmatianrescueco.org. Adoption $250. If interested in this dog, please go to www.dalmatianrescueco.org and submit an application for adoption. Under Adoptions, please read our adoption policy. We must have an application before we can begin the adoption process and each dog does have foster contact listed.",

She would be available for adoption to the right home; however we expect that she will live her remaining days at ARF since she is elderly and incontinent. We have a hospice program here for senior dogs to live out their days, and we are happy to have Lucy here. She has her favoirte person and is often seen out on the town getting ice cream or sometimes even subway and taco bell! Lucille is still very playful and loves to go on walks!\n\nTo make a donation for her care please visit www.munciearf.com",

We have taken the time to address exactly what we are looking for in a home for Snowball, to save both you and us time when looking for a suitable match.\n\nSnowball has been in rescue since May 2019 and in boarding since the end of June 219 (thank you, Cara). Although we all love him, we know he needs to be in his forever home. Snowball is not yet two years old. \n\nSnowball is goofy, friendly, and an oversized dog who chews and loves to play with toys. Snowball is typically friendly to meet other dogs but he is easily over-stimulated and redirects at them so he needs to live as an only dog (ie when the door bell rings, when playing gets too rough, etc). The same goes for cats. He is fine to meet cats but he enjoys chasing them and they get him ramped up. Please do not reply if you have dogs or cats living in your home. He is not a candidate for dog parks or off-leash play. He does best in a controlled circumstance and needs fenced in space.\n\nSnowball does have anxiety (paces and pants) but has responded well to a low daily dose of anti-anxiety meds. His ideal home would be a country setting with a fenced area for him or even just big backyard, that he can protect and lounge in. He is barker and would not be suitable for an apartment or townhouse. Please do not reply if you live in a condo or apartment. A quiet home, without a lot of people coming and going would be best for him. Unfortunately, when he was 6 months old, he earned himself a bite record, which did have to do with the circumstance he was in but nonetheless, he must go to an adult-only home (no exceptions). Please do not reply if you have kids. We will explain this in more detail to anyone who believes he may be their next family member but again, no kids and no exceptions.\n\nSnowball\u2019s forever home must be someone willing to work with him using positive reinforcement methods and absolutely no force. If you want to be an \u201calpha\u201d, than he is not for you. Someone who would be open to continuing work with a professional would be ideal. He is a young dog and loves to learn! \n\nSnowball has not been exposed to livestock and is afraid of the dark. In his kennel, he sleeps with a nightlight on. He was housetrained but due to being in a kennel environment for several months, may need a refresher as well as someone committed to integrating him back into a house dog.\n\nSnowball is neutered, UTD on all vaccines, had xrays of his hips done (fine) and had declaws removed. He is said to be a mix of a Great Pyrenees. He is not for a first time dog owner and should ideally live with someone with Livestock Guardian Dog experience. \n\nSnowball is located in Georgina, ON. His adoption fee is $500. The first ste is a completed adoption application which can be found on our website at www.underdograilroadcanada.com. If it looks to be a suitable match, you will be contacted to setup a meet and greet at his foster home. \n\nPlease allow us time to reply to you; the rescue is an unpaid volunteer position that is done in-between our real jobs and home life. Thank you for taking the time to read the above!",

            "description": "Hey, guys! My name is Archer. I came back to TIRR Rescue in early 2020.\n\nI was adopted about a year ago by a college professor. He tended to have a lot of students in and out, and all those strangers coming and going made me nervous. I got into a little trouble with one of the students when they came too close, too fast. My owner decided it was best for TIRR Rescue to find me a more suitable forever home, since his lifestyle made me so nervous all the time.\n\nI\u2019m pretty chill once I get to know you. I get along well with most dogs my size (I\u2019ve never been around small dogs or cats, so I don\u2019t know about them yet). I absolutely love to roll around in the dirt or on the grass and then come rub against my people! Hanging out with my people is one of my favorite pastimes; I am, however, a one-person dog. I get nervous around strangers, new places, and loud sounds. I would do best in a home with someone who doesn\u2019t get many visitors and is just looking for a buddy to cuddle with or warm their feet!\n\nIf you think you might be that person, be sure to talk to my rescue people!\n\n~~~~\n\nPERSONALITY:\nArcher is a sweet dog with a nervous disposition.  Strange people, places, and noises make him nervous.  He would do best in a home with one or two people with whom he can bond and not have to worry about having a lot of people in and out of his space.\n\n~~~~\n\nTo learn more about Archer, please visit tirrrescue.org/archer.",

If you are interested in the loving Scout, please fill out an application at floridacocker.org or for more information please call 813-245-1833",

She is a tiny little spit fire who thinks she is a bigger dog.   She takes commands very well and is house broken.   She currently lives with other dogs in the rescue and gets along with all of the,  She is spayed and is up to date with her shots.\n\nIf you want to meet any of the New Life K-9 Rescue Dogs, we really need you to fill out an application FIRST. Click here to go to our application Complete each of the questions carefully, it really helps us understand you and your dog interests. We will not let anyone meet any of our dogs until we have reviewed your application. We saved these dogs so we are really invested in making sure their future families are just as committed as we are! We try to respond within 24 hours. (We are all volunteers and work full-time so we get back to you).\n\nAfter we review your application and contact you, first we do a meet and greet with all members of your family including your dogs in a neutral place like a local park. If all goes well, we will do a home check and finalize the adoption..\n\nWe only place dogs in the Southern California area, if you are located elsewhere, please check your local shelters or other rescues that are in your area,",

            "description": "Meet Sasha,  Sasha was a rescue from under a house in Hartsville Tn.  She had been roaming the streets and being fed by multiple people until she decided to have her 8 puppies under a porch.  Sasha was one of the lucky ones and was taken into foster and was a wonderful mother.  She was very cautious in the beginning protecting her babies.  Sasha loves to play but would do best in a home where the other dogs are not overpowering to her.  She will let the other dog know when she has had enough.  \n\nShe likes to take walks and does well on a leash.  She loves her toys and loves to eat.  Sasha would be best with older children.  She might be a little shy at first but warms up quickly.  She loves to get in your lap and just be loved on.  If you are a looking for a companion to walk with and just hang out with meet Sasha.  I have a lot of video and would be glad to send it so you can see her. She seems to be more comfortable with women but is fine with the foster\u2019s husband but it took a little bit.  \n\nSasha is up to date on vaccines, heart worm negative and on preventions for heart worm and flea and tick and is micro chipped.  She is spayed and approximately 50 lbs and 3 years old.  \n\nSasha is currently located in Tennessee and the adoption fee is $150.  Transportation may be available to out of state adopters for an additional cost depending on the area. The first step in our process is submitting the application.  We are happy to set up a meet and greet once an application has been approved. If you would like to adopt Sasha please fill out our online adoption application at http://safehaventn.com/ .",

            "description": "The princess is house and crate trained and she signals when she needs to go out for a potty break. She does not hesitate to go outside in rain or snow, which is great! Initially, she might bark a little when she realizes we\u2019re leaving the house, but she settles down quickly. She prefers to be close to her people and doggie friends, but will nap if left alone.\n\nHelga is very clever and has excellent problem-solving skills. She was the first dog in the house to figure out the doggie door. She has trouble walking on the hardwood floors so we put down a few runners to help her travel throughout the ground floor. When we clean, she skirts around the hardwood to hop from one area to the next. Sometimes she will run and walk over the floors, but she has continued to slip and this scares her. She also seems scared of the carpeted stairs and the wooden basement steps and will not go upstairs or downstairs no matter the treat or coaxing involved. She manages very well with the concrete/brick steps to get in and out of the house.\n\nShe will beg for your food and get very close to you if she thinks you\u2019re eating something, but a firm no keeps her at bay. She is an opportunist hound and if you leave things within reach, she will take advantage of your oversight. We can\u2019t leave anything out or she\u2019ll find a way to get into it \u2013 and she adores shredding paper products! Helga is learning to take treats gently as she tends to snap in her enthusiasm, so we don\u2019t recommend a home with young children. She does not resource guard and is not food-aggressive, but she will snatch treats from the other dogs. Her foster siblings are very mild-mannered, but we still feed and treat them separately.\n\nHer favorite activity is running around the fenced yard to explore and occasionally dig for treasure. We still supervise her in the yard as she will dig under the fence. She especially enjoys romping with other dogs, so a home with another sweet dog or two would be ideal. Her favorite game is to \u201csteal\u201d her mastiff brother\u2019s toy and try to get him to chase her. Helga is extremely sociable and greets people and dogs nicely. She walks well on a leash, but will sometimes pull if she catches an interesting scent. She does not yank on the leash and is easily redirected to continue her leisurely stroll.\n\nHelga is a rather quiet hound, but when she decides to alert or complain, it is a huge sound that\u2019s typical of her breed. For this reason, we don\u2019t recommend an apartment or condo living arrangement for her. She has not jumped on counters or on people since we\u2019ve had her, but she will nudge you and bump into you to get attention.\n\nHere are some of the quirky and delightful things that she does: overturn her doggie bed to scrunch it up and lay awkwardly over it for naps, stare at the pantry door in hopes of treats, bark a bit while she\u2019s going potty as if to tell the world of her accomplishment, follow you around the house, press into you as if she\u2019s hugging you back, snore adorably while sleeping, wiggle her beautiful ears at you endearingly.\n\nWe are crazy about Princess Helga and would keep her with us, but three dogs is our limit and we want to keep fostering. She\u2019s a true darling and a loving companion, and worthy of all the love and adoration a forever family has to give.\n\nHelga's Webpage - http://beaglemaryland.org/brsm_ms/vIndividualCurrentDog.aspx?dogid=69759\nAdoptable Dog Webpage - http://beaglemaryland.org/brsm_ms/vCurrentDogs.aspx\n\nIf you'd like to adopt one of our beagles:\n*Go to our Website - href=\"http://beaglemaryland.org\n*Review our  Standards for Adoption - http://beaglemaryland.org/Home.aspx?pg=standardsforadoption.htm\n*Fill out an Adopter Profile - http://brsmbeagles.org/new_site/Documents/BRSM_profile_secure.pdf\n and email it to us (or print it off, fill it in and send it via regular mail, if you prefer)\n*A BRSM volunteer will contact you to guide you through the rest of the process!\n\nWe hope to hear from you, and so do the beagles!",

            "description": "Handsome Henry is a two year old pup who has a lot of fun energy and is an active boy. \n\nHe is friendly to all adults and loves to make new people friends. He really enjoys going on outings to pet adoption fairs.\n\nHe could use more basic training, so a little patience on his new parents part would be helpful. He does know how to sit on command and you can tell that this boy truly does yearn for and enjoy structure in his life. He appreciates guidance and feels pretty proud of himself when he is a good boy and pleases you!\n\nHe does tend to resource guard so needs a confident adopter who can train him not to feel the need to do that.\n\nHe loves affection and playtime and toys. \n\nHe has been friendly to all new people so far here at the center and at adoption fairs, however, at about a year old in a home setting, Henry decided children just were not his thing and he came back to us to find a new home. (He was adopted from us as a little puppy.)\n\nHe is a good boy in his crate, resting quietly when it is crate time here at the center.\n\nHe may be okay with other dogs and a meet and greet with your dog would be a good idea to see if they like each other if you currently have a dog. \n\nHenry does fine around the other dogs at our adoption fairs though sometimes all his energy can be a bit too much for the other dogs.\n\nHe is not so hot with kitties however so no cats in his new home, please.\n\nHenry is a big, active young dog who would love to have an equally active new owner who could take him for long walks and adventures. \n\nHe will do really well in a family that can teach him good doggie manners. He is certainly smart and very trainable. A Gentle Leader type device will be helpful in training him not to pull on the leash. \n\nYou can come meet Henry at the SPCA of the Triad.\n\nApply online at www.triadspca.org or come meet in person at the center located at 3163 Hines Chapel Rd. Greensboro, NC 27405. We are open Tues - Fri 10:00 AM - 5:00 PM and Sat 10:00 AM - 4:00 PM and Sun 12:00 PM - 4:00 PM.",

An amazing woman stepped up to foster her and so we were able to save her life. Thank goodness we did because the fosters daily \"Farrah tales\" have amused us for quite some time. This girl is the funniest, sweetest, goofiest mess ever. She is bossy and female dogs aren't her jam, she loves male dogs and she does ok with females as puppies. She's fostered on a hobby farm and sometimes does ok with livestock and sometimes not so if around livestock she will need supervision. This is NOT a hiking companion and the only marathon she will participate in is Netflix. However this being said she's a complete delight and the entire room lights up and you can't help but smile when she saunters in. \n\nIf you're interested in fostering or adopting this sweet gal please contact us! \n\n $200.00 Adoption Fee \n(Which is considered a non refundable donation and being we are a 501c3 organization it is tax deductible. The fee itself is not negotiable, our vets don't negotiate and thus neither do we.)",

Just copy and paste the link below into your browser (or simply type it in) and then search for the dog's \"gallery\" by name\n\n          http://adoptasleddog.smugmug.com\n\nVIDEOS:  In addition to photo albums, almost every dog has a video which will give you a much better \"feel\" for his or her personality.  NOTE:  In the new Petfinder format, it has become quite a bit more difficult to find and to play videos.  Please PAGE THROUGH the photos, looking for a photo overlaid in the center with a \"play\" arrow inside a circle.  This icon is white, so it can be difficult to see. \n In many (most) cases, the video is the last photo displayed as you page through.  Just click on that photo and it will play.  Please make sure you CHECK ON THE PETFINDER VIDEO ICON, above, to see a video of this wonderful dog!  Our videos will include, at a minimum, whatever info we had on the dog upon (or shortly after) his/her arrival into our program.  There will sometimes be video updates as well.  And in every case, our Adoptions Coordinator can be emailed at ADOPTASLEDDOG@AOL.COM to answer questions and provide the most current information we have on the dog.  \n\nNOTES:  Please see video or contact our Adoptions Coordinator at ADOPTASLEDDOG@AOL.COM.\n\nADOPTION DONATION:  $250  Before adoption, all Northern Lights dogs (regardless of whether Petfinder's symbols appear) are spayed or neutered, microchipped, heartworm negative, fully vaccinated and tested/treated for known parasites.\n \nWHAT TO DO IF YOU WANT TO ADOPT THIS DOG:  Email us at ADOPTASLEDDOG@AOL.COM to request an application and get started.  WE DO NOT HAVE AN ONLINE APPLICATION - you will have to request one via email.  We will review your application to determine if there is a good fit between you and/or your family and this dog.  We may suggest another dog or dog(s) if we can offer a better fit in terms of lifestyle, experience, other pets, etc.  A vet check, reference checks, and a home visit will be conducted before an adoption can be considered for approval.  \n \nNORTHERN LIGHTS DOES NOT HAVE A PHYSICAL SHELTER.  We are a nonprofit rescue organization comprised of individuals who open their private homes to foster dogs in need of a second chance..  When fosters are not available, we often pay to board a dog until space is available.  New fosters and donations to pay for boarding are always desperately needed us.  Email us at KATYLIED2@AOL.COM if you are interested in donating or for information on fostering.\n \nFAQ:  For information regarding our organization, as well as adoption policies and practices, please visit our Petfinder Home Page at WWW.NORTHERNLIGHTS.PETFINDER.COM.\n \n \nNOTICE:  In the vast majority of cases, the dogs in our program and rescued from shelters, and Northern Lights has no means by which to collect or verify a dog's history.  We work in concert with our veterinarians, and breed and age estimates are based on a combination of professional input and our collective experience.  Our policy with information acquired prior to acceptance and while the dogs are in our care is that of \"full disclosure\".  It is our goal to ensure the adopter has all available information to ensure the best possible match between the dog and the adopter(s).  If we have identified a behavioral or health condition while the dog is in our care and custody, every effort will be made to correct it prior to adoption, OR the adopter will be made aware of the issue or condition prior to adoption.  Northern Lights' screening process is designed to identify only those adopters who are willing, and have the means, to treat conditions which may occur after adoption, and the adopter will be contractually responsible for doing so. However, Northern Lights' policy is to accept any adopted dog back into the program, at any time, for any reason.\n",

            "description": "Say hello to Lucky! His name says it all, but whoever gets to take this sweet tripod home is lucky, too! Until then, this six-year-old pit mix is relishing attention in a loving foster home. Lucky has a very expressive face that will melt anyone's heart. He's a very active guy who loves to play and go for long runs with his people. He gets along with mostly everyone, but has some issues with large male dogs. Lucky's foster mom loves how he nibbles things around him, even baby socks! As for skills, he's learning to be a good boy on a leash and to not pull. He also is crate trained, but takes some convincing with treats. When he's out of the crate, he loves to sit on laps. Lucky's ideal home is a very active one, with or without kids. And although he gets along with other pups, he would prefer to be the only dog so he can get all the attention. Lucky deserves the perfect forever home. Could that be with you? Apply to adopt Lucky today! All Dallas Pets Alive adoptable pets are spayed or neutered, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines upon adoption. The standard minimum donation for dogs over six months to seven years is $200, puppies under six months is $250, dogs eight years and over are $100 unless specified otherwise.

He\u2019s good on leash and non destructive in the home. He would really rather lay on the couch than go for long hikes but he does love to have a ball tossed around for him in the yard. Diesel is very loyal to his people once he trusts them, but in typical mastiff fashion, he can take a little bit to warm up and he is protective of his home with strangers. Because of this, we will only place him in a single family home (no apartments!) or else you\u2019ll be having some annoyed neighbors when he is alert barking over all the activity outside ;) He also would prefer a low traffic home where there aren\u2019t tons of people in and out all the time. He\u2019s a funny, smart, goofy guy with lots of love to give to the right home. Diesel would do best in an adult only home without any other pets, but he may do okay with a laid back female dog who is on the same wavelength as him. \n\nPlease email caredogvolunteers@gmail.com if you would like an application to adopt this handsome stud!",

He has done okay with other dogs, but he can also be very selective. We do not suggest cats or children with Arnie, he can just be too excitable and overbearing. Arnie needs a chance at life, he needs someone to be patient and help him with his socialization. He prefers women over men. He would do well in a home with someone looking for companionship and who has a fenced in back yard. Arnie is a big block-headed sweetheart who would give you an endless amount of kisses! We have been working on leash training and we have seen a significant improvement. Arnie is a big lover who takes his treats very gently and loves belly scratches! He is such an awesome pupper! You can apply to give Arnie a furever home by submitting an application online at https://humanesocietyofnwia.com/index.html  - Available Pets- A wonderful family paid for Arnie's Adoption Fee. Adoption Fee: $0.00 Arrived: September 2019",

All her babies have found homes so now its her turn.  \n\nMitzi loves to play fetch!  She also loves getting to run around in the back yard.  She is a medium energy dog as she does well hanging around the house but still likes to play and run when she can.  She takes time to learn to trust you as she did not have a lot of socializing in her past.  She has done well swimming at Water Bark and with the people she's met there and does great with her foster mom.  She is good with other dogs but can play a little rough so would need a dog who is k with that.  Male dogs seem to be a better fit.  \n\nMitzi would like a home where she has patient owners willing to give her time to adjust.  She will not do well with children as they are a little too intimidating for her.  \n\nMitzi is crate, leash, and house trained. \n\nMitzi is spayed, microchipped, and current on her vaccines.  Her adoption fee is $175.  \n\nIf you would like to adopt Mitzi and make her a part of your family, please contact ForeverYoursOKC@gmail.com.",

            "description": "Rocco is very smart, 2 year old Terrier mix, weighing in at about 40 lbs. He is cautious of new people, but that changes after spending some quality time together. His perfect home will have no other dogs as he isn't a fan of sharing his toys and food, no young childdren, and a fenced yard. Rocco is kennel trained. His adopter will need to be dedicated to working with him on his fears. He is great with feline friends! \n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Rocco is $400 which is TAX DEDUCTIBLE, and goes toward providing supportive services to animals in the home, as well as the high cost of vetting our dogs in rescue. If you would like to welcome Rocco into your home, please begin by submitting our adoption application. The adoptions for all of our dogs will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver the dogs. If you would like to learn more about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue, or donate to our dogs, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com. We invite you to visit our Facebook Page, and when you visit, please don't forget to Like our Facebook page so that you wont miss any information about our dogs and events!",

She likes dogs as long as she has a slow introduction and is corrected when she gets too excited. She is crate trained and potty trained. She has undergone heartworm treatment so is under leash restriction for awhile. She is great on the leash and loves to go for walks.\n\nLoves: long walks, the outdoors, and sunshine.\nPastimes: looking out the window, giving doggie kisses, playing hide and seek\nCommands: sit, stay, heel, come and knows her name.\nSuperpower: great leash manners, kennel trained\nDislikes: the rain and the vacuum\nAstrological sign: Scorpio \n\nKiki Is dog selective and needs to be with a family with older kids. \n\nInterested in meeting Kiki? \n\nAll Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue dogs are in homes with foster families; we do not have a shelter where dogs are available for daily viewing.\n\nOur process is as follows:\n1.  Review our policies and adoption radius  on our website: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n2.  Submit an application for review and approval;\n3.  MPM Rescue reviews application and checks vet records and references;\n4.  MPM foster contacts approved applicant(s) to arrange a home check and meeting with available dog(s);\n5.   If there is a good fit, adoption is completed with a contract and fees (payable via check or cash).\n\nThe adoption fee is listed here: http://mapawsmepetrescue.com/adopt/\n\nDogs from Ma, Paws & Me Pet Rescue come with the following medical care already provided:\n- Spay/Neuter surgery\n- Age appropriate vaccinations\n- Heartworm test (for dogs over 6mo) and treatment if positive\n- Microchip\n- Deworming\n- Heartworm and Flea/Tick Preventative\n- Any other necessary medical treatment as recommended by veterinarian\n\n*Please note that the identified breed(s) are best guesses. We very rarely have information on our dogs' actual breeds since they often come to the shelters we work with as strays.*",

            "description": "Kody von Kohlen is a beautiful 2 year-old German Shepherd. This beautiful young girl is so sweet and loving with people she knows, she'll wag a hello and lean in close for affection. She can be unsure with strangers, however, so needs a little time to get to know someone new. Kody enjoys taking strolls with you outside and is good on the leash. She is excellent with other dogs and is so happy when she meets them; in fact, she seems to derive confidence from dogs - she starts wagging her tail and walks great alongside them. Not surprisingly, she does equally as great in doggy playgroups, which she enters happily and ready to go. She\u2019s super friendly and can be playful with her furry friends and has the time of her life. She also does well sharing her run. This treasure can be yours if you are ready to give her your heart. weighs approx 70#s.\n\nWestside dog Biographies, availability and new photos are updated regularly on our website and Facebook page!

            "description": "Penny is 4 years old and 40 lbs. The shelter she came from called her a jack russell mix, but she also looks part hound. She is spayed.\nShe is skittish of people and will need a home that will be patient with her and that will be willing to give her the training she needs. She has warmed up to volunteers who spend time with her. She loves getting treats. She likes other dogs, especially males her size or a little bigger. A good friend of hers is a yellow lab mix named Julius; they enjoy playing together.\nPlease find our applications and valuable information under 'Adopt a dog'* on our website: *www.beaglesandbuddies.com* and email your application to beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Let us know your preference of appointment day/time and which dogs you are interested in and we will do our best to accommodate and email you the closest appointment available. Please allow us up to a week to get back to you. Most appointments will be Friday-Sunday, 10 am - 2 pm, for an hour.\n*Note bring any other dog/s and the entire family to your meet and greet at B&B.* A complimentary training manual is included with each adoption, authored by terristeuben.com. Check out her website - she is fabulous!\nB&B is glad to be open during the pandemic. We know the value and comfort of a loving pet companion and are doing our best to help the dogs and folks who need them. We update our website daily and are always rescuing, vetting, rehabilitating, socializing.\n* We are accepting applications for volunteers to spend time with our dogs, hang out, sing/read to the shy ones, walk/toss ball with those who go to the playgrounds; cleaning, office work, gardening, and building/repair projects! *\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment. Please look at our website and make a list of one or more dogs that you would like to see.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf you have a question about adopting, giving up a dog, boarding, or volunteering, please visit the appropriate tabs on our\nhome page.\n\nFor more specific questions, call 626-444-9664 (please leave a voicemail if no answer) or email at beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Note that\nEmailing\nis always preferred!\n\nThanks!\n\nPlease note: If you are viewing this profile anywhere other than Beagles & Buddies own website, you are not receiving full info.

She enjoys meeting new people and going for long leash walks on our paved walking trails.  She loves to spend time playing in our exercise areas with our volunteers or other dogs. \n\nSusie Q is full-grown weighing only 44 pounds, and we believe she is a Labrador retriever mix. \n\nThis precious girl is waiting to go home with a wonderful family.  Do you have room in your heart and home for Susie Q?\n\nAll of our dogs are spayed or neutered and are current on all vaccinations. They are on monthly heartworm and flea/tick prevention. All of their medical needs are taken care of before they are available for adoption. Our adoption fee is only $100.00. Please complete an application, if you have found a dog you are interested in adopting. You can find our application at www.horsecreekwildlife.org/applic.html. Once completed, you can forward it to adoptions@horsecreekwildlife.org or fax it to 731-926-3000. Kim Austin, our adoption facilitator, will be in contact with you as soon as she has an opportunity to review your application. Understand that she has other duties and she will not ignore any interest shown in adopting one of our dogs. An application will need to be approved before a scheduled time to visit our dogs will be set up.  It may take up to 48 hours before she returns your call or responds to your email, due to work schedules, holidays and adoption events. We do the very best we can for the dogs we have rescued and do not take the adoption process lightly. Please be patient and understand that we will place our rescued dogs in the very best homes possible and reserve the right to refuse applications.",

            "description": "Thank you for your interest in dog who needs a new home. Adoption can be one of the most fulfilling experiences in your life and especially in the life of your new canine companion.\n\nA note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.\n\nOur descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.\n\nAre you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.\n\nJust browsing but interested in poodles and poodle mixes? Please drop a note to applications@carolinapoodlerescue.org with your name, address and phone # and email. We'll add you to our mailing list.\n\nthanks\nthe CPR Adoption team\n\nDate into Rescue: 3/29/2019\nReason for being in rescue: Monroe NC shelter, stray\nFoster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SC\nSpecial Needs? Nadine came to us with heartworms. She has been treated and as of March 2020 is testing negative! She will need to be on preventative without fail for the rest of her life.\nWeight: 37 lbs\nHeight: 21 in\nSpayed/Neutered: Yes\n\nAdoption Fee: $200\n\nFence needed? yes\n\nWhat kind of home would be best for me? Nadine needs a home with compassionate owners who can understand the trauma she has endured, and will be patient with her as she heals and learns to love again. We are seeking a home with an experienced dog owner and someone who is home more than they're away. Nadine has a prey drive- she CANNOT be in a home with cats or small animals.\n\nWhat is my personality like? Nadine is a sweet and shy soul. She seems very leery of men, and slightly leery of women at first. She was obviously maltreated before finding us, and that has affected her ability to trust. She does everything in her power to stay very far from strangers in her area. She doesn't bite, but will scamper away or cowers and rolls over on her back. Her eyes cry \"love me\", but her body language screams \"please don't hurt me again\". She will warm up to people, but it is a very slow process for men. Women seem to have an easier time getting her to trust them. With the caregivers she knows, she greats them with a wagging tail and even does a little \"happy dance\". It takes time for her to trust, but it is worth it. Nadine has tons of potential for the right person willing to give her a chance. She will need a lot of training on a leash, as she does not cooperate on one, and stairs are totally foreign to her. She had to be carried up them like a baby.\n\nNadine won't play with toys at first. In time, she may start to play, but that won't happen until she feels safe and loved in her own environment. She does play with them here at the farm. She will eventually eat treats, but not from your hand or while you look at her at first. Our caregivers have earned her trust and now she takes them gently from their hands. She does seem to really enjoy when you baby talk to her, and she LOVES to rub her belly on the grass. When a dog violates her comfort zone, she will growl to let them know. Once she gets comfortable with you, she will rest her snout in your hands to let you love on her.\n\nHow do I act when I first meet new people? Very shy, avoids eye contact and stays as far from them as possible, but will eventually warm up a little. Treats won't help, only time and a loving, patient owner.\n\nOther tips and tidbits: She had a hard life before coming here, and it shows. She will take a long time to trust again, but it will be totally worth it, she has so much love to give!\n\nHouse trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.\n\nPlease note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.\n\nTo apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.\n\nPlease note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.\n\nThank you for considering CPR.",

She says he's very sweet. He is 75 lbs!  However he is toy aggressive so we feel he may need to go to a home being an only dog.  He loves to play, and is working on potty and crate training. He also does well on a leash. Overall, he's one sweet, handsome pup! Adoption fee is $225. \n\nThank you for your interest in one of our doggies. Please visit our website at humanesocietyhoco.org and fill out an adoption application or view more info on our doggies. We are open on Saturday (10am - 2pm) every week. Please come by and say hi to all of our sweet doggies and for more photos visit us on instagram @dogsofhocohumane\n\n",

So NO apartment life for him. \nHe likes to do things when he wants too, and  loves to be outside in the yard, go for car rides and look out the window or hang his head out the window, he will also follow you around the house and sleep on the floor next to your bed.

She loves to play ball and has learned commands like \"drop it\" and Leave it.\" Honey's early years are a mystery, but indications are that they were not kind to her. She most likely lived in a cage so she will not tolerate a crate.\nUPDATE\n(08/22/2020): Honey has been in a foster home for 2 months. She is insanely housebroken, and is a snuggle bunny of epic proportions. If you are the type of person that wants to love a dog that's been mistreated and be rewarded tenfold, Honey is the one. She is as loyal as they come and deserves a great home.\n\nVisit our site at\n\nhttp://www.heartwormproject.org/application\n\nand complete an application today! Our adoption fee is $200.00.",

A sweetheart, 2-year-old, Boxer mix who is looking for a forever family of my very own!!\n\nAlthough I was a pretty sad girl at the shelter, my spunky personality started to show right away at my foster home! I impressed everyone with my perfect house manners and loveable nature. To top it off, I am already house trained\u2026which just goes to show what a good girl I am!\n\nI am a little shy meeting new people and going new places, so I do need a home that can be patient with me and help me to see that the world isn\u2019t a scary place.  I also need a home with no children. If you have some extra love, extra cuddles, and room for me in your heart you won\u2019t be sorry!  I would also do my best in a home as an only dog.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in being my sweetheart, submit an adoption application for me, Willow! \n\nAdoption Fee: $200.00\n\nApply to adopt Willow and learn more Agape here:  https://www.agaperescue.org/adopt/dogs-for-adoption/\n",

GLINDA - A#42130953Foster's Email: frankferra@gmail.comPictures and Video:Glinda in foster care - https://photos.app.goo.gl/k5rWxZSiyvsoyEHZ7Dog meet: https://youtu.be/u7EzA47nZsQPersonality: Glinda is a sweet and gentle soul. She is approximately 7 years old with a lot puppy energy left in her and would thrive in a household that could give her lots of attention. She loves to be goofy in the yard entertaining herself with the ball, rag doll, or bone and adores to cuddle on the couch with you to watch a movie or read a book. Did I mention she enjoys to give kisses in the most gentle manner? And of course, those belly rubs....what dog doesn't enjoy those?Glinda has some quirks, like us all. I do notice she has a huge prey drive...which means she chases birds that happen to be flying by (yes, even 300 yards in the sky, lol), squirrels, and she is not a fan of moving cars. Although, during the past few walks, she seems to be getting desensitized....which is great! She does not enjoy car rides. We plan to experiment with soft crates in the car to see how she reacts to them.Glinda is crate trained and obeys some commands. Her recall is actually pretty good too. She will eat any food you give her - she is not picky at all! She recently had bloodwork and a urine analysis which both came back clean. She is currently on Heartguard and Simparica (flea & tick). She is up to date on all her shots. if it were not for our resident dog being a bit too territorial, we would have kept Glinda.If you have any questions about Glinda, feel free to email me directly at frankferra@gmail.com.Intake Type: (7/5) StrayWeight: 55lbsThis animal is currently available from foster care through ACCT Philly's Adoptions Programs.

He laughs so much he snorts and he will have you snorting along with him. Slender, handsome, well-chiseled hunk of burning love searching for a permanent long term relationship with someone to spoon with. Oh and yea, he gives free kisses and isn't afraid of some lap snuggling so please be into affection. And once he has stolen your heart, you can buy him lots and lots of tennis balls for Valentine's Day (he's quite literally obsessed with them, which has gotten him into some trouble) or put a ribbon on a fresh stick. He wants you all to himself though because no one loves better than Chorty. Since Chortle's estimated birthdate is 6/14/2015, his adoption fee is $275. If you want to know more about him and to speak to an Adoption Counselor, please complete a survey at https://furkids.org/dog-adoptions/application. Must be at least 21 years of age to adopt. (If the dog you're interested in meeting is living in a foster home, the Adoption Counselor will make an appointment for you to meet the dog at the shelter.) Follow us on Facebook at www.facebook.com/furkidsinc.\n\nBe sure to visit and \"like\" our Facebook page facebook.com/furkidsinc",

Gamora knows all her commands, loves other dogs and, with a little patience, is friendly with people. Gamora's perfect home is suburban or rural, with a fenced-in yard, calm, experienced owners and not too many visitors, and with a confident, happy-go-lucky companion dog. If there are children in her forever home, older teenagers would be best. She is spayed and up to date on vaccinations. If you can give Gamora the happy, loving home she awaits, please fill out an application at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.",

We cannot email back those who do not meet these requirements.\n\n1)Pickles must have a fenced yard.     \n2)Pickles must have another small, playful/high energy dog his size in the home. If you don\u2019t have another dog and are open to two dogs, we have his best friend Sophie for adoption, also on our site.\n3)Pickles must have someone who is home during the day...either works from home, stay at home mom or retired.       \n4)Adoptive Home must be in Atlanta area, no exceptions.      \n5)Pickles needs an owner who has raised and house trained a dog. He is not completely housebroken and needs someone home often and with experience training a dog.\n\nPickles is a 1 year old male, chihuahua/rat terrier mix, about 15 lbs. He\u2019s sweet, loving and playful. He has a lot of love to give. He\u2019s never been around kids, only kids over 13 please.\n\nHe currently lives at a boarding kennel for dogs until adopted. He\u2019s outgoing but can be shy with strangers, but he does get used to them quickly. Anyone meeting him will need to be patient and understand and he will acclimate fairly soon but going to a home with new people will be quite the adjustment. With time, love and patience he will do great.",

When I was brought in, I was shy and would growl and bark. However, the staff has been working with me and I'm much sweeter now. I'm a big fan of belly rubs once you get me out of the kennel. I may be shy at first, but I just need someone who is patient and willing to work to gain my trust. I do NOT like being kenneled, though. The Pet Savers people think that maybe I had a bad experience with kennels in the past, which is why I am so unhappy whenever I am put in one. I'd love to meet you\n.\n\nFee $90\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit petsaversshreveport.org and find our adoption application under the 'Dogs' tab.

I was afraid no one was going to find me and I was going to be stuck in my kennel forever. You can see by the big smile on my face that I am really happy Pet Savers took me in and now I'm safe. According to the note that was left with me I'm housebroken. I'm a Lab mix so I'm a large dog. I'm hoping to find an adopter who will never ever abandon me.\n\nFee $125\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit petsaversshreveport.org and find our adoption application under the 'Dogs' tab.

I am a large and powerful guy who loves to play tug of war. Because of my strength and the fact I like to grab whatever might be dangling from your hand I need a home without any small children. Also I'm going to need some leash training because I don't like to wear a leash. I don't want to brag but I think I'm a really good looking guy. I mean look at that picture you gotta agree I take a great photo. The only way to see what a great guy I am is to stop by and meet me.\n\nEst.

Adapting well with her foster, Eric, and his family the last 16 months, Cinnamon has come a long way.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Cinnamon, are up for an endearing challenge and have plenty of patience and time to be able to put into her, please call Eric at 612-310-3362.\n\nAdoption Fee: $350.00 (no checks) \n\nMORE ABOUT CINNAMON:\n\nCinnamon is a 2.5 year old petite (36#) pit mix that was found mauled, abandoned, tied to a tree and left for dead.  Given her environment and the other dogs around her, she was suspected to be in a Pitbull fighting ring.\n\nLast Hope was called in to help save her.  Cinnamon endured 8 hours of reconstructive surgery to her face.  She didn't just have lacerations to the skin, she had actual flesh torn from her bones which is something no animal should have to endure.\n\nMaking way to the world of rescue, Eric, one of Last Hope's fosters, picked her up after two weeks of recovering from surgery.  Knowing that Cinnamon would be extremely dog aggressive, with five other dogs in his home, Eric knew it would be very challenging.\n\nEric started her right away with several reactive dog training classes at Canine  Coach.  One instructor told Eric that they have never seen this level in a dog.  Although Cinnamon has improved, she will most likely always be reactive to the degree where she and other dogs are not safe together.\n\nCinnamon was cheated from being a loveable dog her first few months of life, but being so young, she has plenty of time to catch up and make that happen with the right person.\n\nShe loves to be around humans.  She loves to cuddle with Eric and his family and is very attentive, however, her strength cannot be underestimated.\n\nOur fosters do the best they can to provide all information about the animal's background and temperament while in foster care in their home.  An adopters routine and home environment is likely going to be different than that in their foster home.  Sometimes there is more that comes out about a dog's personality once they have been able to settle in a home and truly become comfortable.  There are great articles out there written about the different stages a pet goes through after adoption, discussing transitions that happen at 3 days, 3 weeks, and 3 months.  We highly recommend reading about this - it will help you understand the transition your new pet goes through.   \n\nLast Hope, Inc. is an all volunteer, foster based, no kill rescue! You can see almost all of our dogs on Saturdays from 11-3 at the Burnsville PetSmart and at the Lakeville PetSmart. \n\nPolicies: You do not have to have a fence to adopt a dog from us, but some dogs will require a fence or acres to play, or an active family who will make sure the dog gets the exercise it needs to be happy.  Some dogs do not have the temperament that will do well with young children.   \n\nThe Adoption Fee is not enough to cover the vet bills. Sales tax of almost 7.25% is also included in the adoption fee that you see. Please consider donating to Last Hope to help us save these animals!\n\nCAN YOU FOSTER? By taking a dog or puppies into your home temporarily and then coming to our adoption days to help find them homes, we can save more! If interested, please email jaime3369@gmail.com and give us your contact information and what you would like to foster and someone will get back to you!

            "description": "Date of birth: 7/21/2015\n\n12/17/2020: Halpert and Beesly are a super sweet Pit Bull duo who are looking for a home together. They are both very friendly and affectionate and love attention. The pair were found together in downtown KCK. They were pretty beat up with wounds in various stages of healing and they were very skinny. They are very bonded to each other, always following each other and checking in on the other. \n\n\u2022 Beesley is grey & white, female, and weighs 57 lbs. Halpert is B&W, male, and weighs 70 lbs.  \n\n\u2022 Beesly and Halpert are both big lap dogs! They enjoy hanging out on our wooden playground structure and sunbathing. They are both playful, but we\u2019d describe them as moderately active. They know sit and they love treats and are food motivated\u2026 especially Halpert\u2014 he loves his treats!  \n\n\u2022 The pair keep their kennel clean and neither are barkers.  \n\n\u2022 Halpert is the leader, and Beesly is more laid back and follows his lead. They\u2019re a wonderful pair!  \n\n\u2022 Beesly gets along with most other dogs and enjoys play groups. Halpert is a little choosier and we\u2019re working with him to see if he can play with other dogs besides Beesly.\n\n\u2022 Beesly and Halpert wouldn't be a good match for a home with young kids, but would be fine with teenagers who are comfortable with playful dogs.\n\n\u2022  They also need a home without cats. \n\n\u2022 We think they are likely to go over a short fence if they see a cat or something else to chase, so a taller 5 ft fence would probably be needed to keep them contained.  \n\n\u2022 Beesly & Halpert are about 5 years old. They have been spayed/neutered, vaccinated and microchipped. They both tested positive for heartworms when they first arrived. They have completed heartworm treatment and are now heartworm free!  \n\n\u2022 We suspect that they had very rough lives before coming here, but they\u2019re both a couple of sweethearts! \n\nMORE ON ADOPTING OUR DOGS... \n\n> COVID-19 UPDATE: PLEASE SUBMIT AN ONLINE ADOPTION APPLICATION AND A MEMBER OF OUR ADOPTIONS TEAM WILL REACH OUT TO YOU. Please visit our web site at HSGKC.ORG for an adoption application, our current COVID-19 adoption protocol, and other adoption info. \n\n> If you decide you'd like to adopt one of the pets you meet, we reserve the pet for you but we generally don't send the pet home with you that day. We\u2019ll instead schedule a pick up date and time that\u2019s convenient for you.\u00a0  \n\n> Our goal is to send you home with a healthy pet and any information and support you may need to help your new pet adjust to his or her new home.  All of our dogs & puppies have been spayed or neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, treated for fleas & ticks, tested for heartworms (7 mo. and over), and are on monthly heartworm preventative. Puppies who are too young to receive all the necessary puppy boosters and/or first rabies shot may be brought back to us for those vaccines at no extra charge. You will also receive a leash, collar, coupons for pet supplies and services, toys, and educational materials. And we'll give your dog a bath before he or she goes home! \n\n> Please note that we prefer and may require a fenced yard for many of our dogs.  Exceptions are made on an individual basis depending on the dog's needs, the person's dog experience, the dog's and person's activity levels, home environment and other factors. \n\nThank you for searching for a shelter pet!\n\nDog Adoption Contact Info:\nEmail: christine@hsgkc.org\nPhone: 913.596.1000 ext. 113\nhttp://hsgkc.org",

            "description": "Date of birth: 7/21/2015\n\n12/17/2020: Halpert and Beesly are a super sweet Pit Bull duo who are looking for a home together. They are both very friendly and affectionate and love attention. The pair were found together in downtown KCK. They were pretty beat up with wounds in various stages of healing and they were very skinny. They are very bonded to each other, always following each other and checking in on the other. \n\n\u2022 Beesley is grey & white, female, and weighs 57 lbs. Halpert is B&W, male, and weighs 70 lbs.  \n\n\u2022 Beesly and Halpert are both big lap dogs! They enjoy hanging out on our wooden playground structure and sunbathing. They are both playful, but we\u2019d describe them as moderately active. They know sit and they love treats and are food motivated\u2026 especially Halpert\u2014 he loves his treats!  \n\n\u2022 The pair keep their kennel clean and neither are barkers.  \n\n\u2022 Halpert is the leader, and Beesly is more laid back and follows his lead. They\u2019re a wonderful pair!  \n\n\u2022 Beesly gets along with most other dogs and enjoys play groups. Halpert is a little choosier and we\u2019re working with him to see if he can play with other dogs besides Beesly.\n\n\u2022 Beesly and Halpert wouldn't be a good match for a home with young kids, but would be fine with teenagers who are comfortable with playful dogs.\n\n\u2022  They also need a home without cats. \n\n\u2022 We think they are likely to go over a short fence if they see a cat or something else to chase, so a taller 5 ft fence would probably be needed to keep them contained.  \n\n\u2022 Beesly & Halpert are about 5 years old. They have been spayed/neutered, vaccinated and microchipped. They both tested positive for heartworms when they first arrived. They have completed heartworm treatment and are now heartworm free!  \n\n\u2022 We suspect that they had very rough lives before coming here, but they\u2019re both a couple of sweethearts! \n\nMORE ON ADOPTING OUR DOGS... \n\n> COVID-19 UPDATE: PLEASE SUBMIT AN ONLINE ADOPTION APPLICATION AND A MEMBER OF OUR ADOPTIONS TEAM WILL REACH OUT TO YOU. Please visit our web site at HSGKC.ORG for an adoption application, our current COVID-19 adoption protocol, and other adoption info. \n\n> If you decide you'd like to adopt one of the pets you meet, we reserve the pet for you but we generally don't send the pet home with you that day. We\u2019ll instead schedule a pick up date and time that\u2019s convenient for you.\u00a0  \n\n> Our goal is to send you home with a healthy pet and any information and support you may need to help your new pet adjust to his or her new home.  All of our dogs & puppies have been spayed or neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, treated for fleas & ticks, tested for heartworms (7 mo. and over), and are on monthly heartworm preventative. Puppies who are too young to receive all the necessary puppy boosters and/or first rabies shot may be brought back to us for those vaccines at no extra charge. You will also receive a leash, collar, coupons for pet supplies and services, toys, and educational materials. And we'll give your dog a bath before he or she goes home! \n\n> Please note that we prefer and may require a fenced yard for many of our dogs.  Exceptions are made on an individual basis depending on the dog's needs, the person's dog experience, the dog's and person's activity levels, home environment and other factors. \n\nThank you for searching for a shelter pet!\n\nDog Adoption Contact Info:\nEmail: christine@hsgkc.org\nPhone: 913.596.1000 ext. 113\nhttp://hsgkc.org",

I am an active 65lb puppy at heart.\n\nI do require plenty of exercise and if I had someone to hike or run with, that would be ideal....if you can keep up! I am quite the lover and everyone says that I am a big goofball!\n\nI was rescued from a shelter in Houston Texas where my previous owner surrendered me and my brother. Before that we were kept outside on a chain. I was scheduled to be euthanized when Wag Again Rescue jumped in and saved me from death.\n\nNow that I have seen love and how it is to be with a family, my eyes have been opened to a whole new world! I am fun, curious, intelligent, and a happy active girl. I love to explore new places and learn new things! With a proper introduction, I am a bit dog selective. My preference is to be an only dog, but I have been able to do well with dogs that are my size. I do like to chase cats, which is heavily frowned upon, so I probably should refrain from living with them. I am a big girl and my foster family has said that I do better with older kids. Otherwise, I am pretty easy-going and happy!\n\nI am currently being fostered in Houston, Texas as I search for my furever home. Once I find the perfect home, Wag Again will schedule me for transport to the PNW. Transport fees are $200 (this is separate from the adoption fee) as this fee is set by the transport company. All transports are done by ground, because those airplanes can be very scary.",

He's around 6 years old and 55lbs. He can come off as reserved/shy at first, but will soon win you over with his loving, calm, and relaxed personality. Kenny is a gentle soul. His favorite things to do include walks in the park where he can watch the squirrels, napping, and eating gourmet dog cookies from the pet store.?\n\n**BECAUSE OF OUR REQUIREMENT FOR A HOME VISIT, WE ARE ONLY ABLE TO ADOPT TO HOMES IN THE NORTHERN VA / MARYLAND / DC METRO AREA**\n\nWe have adoption events EVERY SATURDAY from 12-3 p.m. Please note that not all dogs can attend every event, so if you are interested in meeting a particular dog, please complete a no-obligation application on our website at http://www.muttloverescue.org/application.html OR write to adopt@muttloverescue.org.\n\nUpcoming adoption events:\n\nMutt Love Rescue is doing everything we can to ensure the health and safety of our volunteers and adopters while continuing our mission to find homes for as many dogs as possible.\n\nEffective immediately, we will not be holding our weekly adoption events. Dogs available for adoption can be met by appointment only. Potential adopters should submit an online application at http://muttloverescue.org/application.html. Once we receive your application, we will contact you to let you know the next steps.\n\nWe are always desperate for foster homes, now more than ever. If you are interested in fostering during this difficult time, please complete an application... unless you are a previous adopter/foster, then you can just contact us via phone (703-988-2608) or email (adopt@muttloverescue.org) to tell us which dog you want to foster!\n\nFor information on sponsoring this dog, please write to adopt@muttloverescue.org.\n\nWE NEED FOSTER HOMES!

Bully now knows what love feels like and wants nothing more than to be by his humans side. Don't let his breed hold you back, this boy wants nothing more than to please and he is such a mush. Bully's ideal home would have no other pets as he has enough love that another pet is not needed! \nIf interested in meeting Bully please fill out an application at fureverfriendz.org to be considered. \nBully's adoption fee is $200\n",

            "description": "Jojo loves to sit in the recliner and watch out the window, he loves to sleep on the couch and will sleep with his head on your lap for hours if you let him. He loves to be covered up and will sit there and gently paw you until you cover him up, then he will lie down. He rarely barks or even makes a sound, very quiet. Loves to sleep in the bed with you, right up against you so if you need space he might not be the one for you.  \n\nJojo is a boy who can do it all! Not only is he full of spunk and personality, but he'll also make you laugh, shower you with love and impress you with all his skills. Although JoJo can be shy with new friends, he'll shamelessly beg for belly rubs and butt scratches when he's had time to warm up. Despite his \"senior\" status, he has plenty of energy for long walks, outdoor adventures.  He walks very well on his harness and leash.\n\nAnd did we mention that JoJo's an excellent houseguest? He's house-trained, crate-trained and happy to snooze on the couch when you're gone! Because he loves to soak up all the spotlight, JoJo would prefer to be the only pet in the home (though he'd be willing to make an exception for the perfect like sized doggy friend!). He's not up for house parties, so he does best in a chill, adult-only environment. \n\n\nTo learn more contacts us at adoption@ihadro.org or apply today at www.ihadro.org!\n",

It just breaks our hearts.  She still has a lot of spunk and warms up pretty fast to new people. She does love to go on walks, playing in the water and sunning in the play yard.  It's just so hard for us to see this girl live her life at the shelter, she deserves so much more.  My adoption fee is $125-150 which includes my spay/neuter, age appropriate vaccinations,  heartworm disease test,  microchip/registration fee and collar .

No\nEnergy Level: High Energy\nNeeds a fenced in yard? Yes\nAdoption Fee: $\n\nAny other info: \n\nMeet Gayle!\n\nGayle came to us from St.Clair animal control and has a bit of a hard time finding the right home.\n\nGayle is a total sweetheart but she does have some over stimulation issues that lead to quick fits of \"aggression\" type behavior that we are working on with her.\n\nAt this time, Gayle would do best in a low traffic home where her family will be dedicated to working on her training.\n\nAlthough Gayle does have her setbacks, we just know the right family is out there and will know her worth when they see her. Gayle is an absolutely beautiful soul and has so much unconditional love to offer. Plus, she gives the absolute best kisses with her big ol shar-pei snout.\n\nWe love Gayle dearly here but we know she deserves a real forever home. She is very friendly and extremely smart. She is food motivated and eager to please making training a wonderful experience. She loves people and other dogs but may need to be the only dog while she is learning her manners.\n\nGayle is basically a pup herself at just over a year old. Unfortunately she has spent a majority of her life in the shelter. She is playful and affectionate and wants so badly to find a home. She has so much potential and with the right diligent and dedicated owner she would thrive.\n\nGayle is spayed, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines. She would love a big back yard to run and play in and a family to call her own for the holidays.\n\n\nOur adoption fees include the pets spay or neuter, microchip, up to date vaccines, heartworm/tick disease testing and fecal check.  All adoption fees can be found on our groups' Petfinder page. \nTHE FIRST STEP TO OUR ADOPTION PROCESS IS TO FILL OUT AN ADOPTION APPLICATION ON OUR WEBSITE, www.serenityanimalhospital.net, under the \"Adopt From Us\" Tab. Please email the application to adoptions@serenityanimalhospital.net or drop it off in person during our business hours.\nAny questions regarding our adoptable dogs can be emailed along with your application. IT IS BEST TO FILL OUT AN APPLICATION PROMPTLY.  FAILURE TO DO SO WILL DELAY YOUR CHANCE TO ADOPT THE PET OF YOUR CHOICE. Please do not call the front desk with questions about our adoption program, as our receptionists are not involved with the adoption program. Allow us a few days to contact you about your application as we do get many in on a daily basis.  We will contact you as soon as possible. \n",

Don't forget to fill out our online application:  http://www.coastalgsrsd.org/webform/1774/adoption-application.\n\nThe minimum adoption donation ranges from $300 to $400. This amount only partially covers the cost of veterinary care, boarding fees, and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs and is 100% tax deductible.\n\nPrior to placement, all dogs will be spayed or neutered, receive current vaccinations, and are usually microchipped. If not, arrangements will be made on an individual basis. Special consideration may be given to those willing to adopt older dogs or dogs with physical problems.\n\nOur adoption process begins with completing an application on-line.

            "description": "Chocolate is as sweet as his name implies once he gets to know you. His heart has a huge capacity of love to offer once he gets comfortable with you. He is a playful and happy and enjoys gnawing on a bone or squeaky toy. He has been in foster for awhile now and has proven himself to have good house manners. He demonstrates good doggie behavior in a daily basis with no issues or complaints. He loves his crate and is very comfortable there. His foster mom reports no issues with separation at all. The same goes for thunderstorms, no problems with that either. Chocolate's main issue seems to be trusting new people. Currently, everyone who handles him has total control and finds his behavior very predictable. Chocolate has a close circle of friends and he must feel comfortable with you before you can join the circle. For this reason, a potential adopter would need to meet him a few times so he can familiarize himself with you. Once he established trust, he's yours.\n\n> He has done well with several dogs in the household as well. He is now also familiar with the neighbors' dogs too.\n\n> Initially, he had some fear of body handling but that too, has faded.. Again, it's all about TRUST for Chocolate. He needs a home where there aren't a lot of people going in and out, as Chocolate values his privacy. A single owner would probably be best.\n\n> He loves to run, play and his daily walks are always met with enthusiasm...sometimes too much as he can pull strongly on the leash.. He has grown accustomed to some of the regular runners/walkers along the route and will proceed without issue. New activities are strange to him, he may stop to watch construction materials being unloaded, a ups delivery or roofers at work.. the more familiar he gets with seeing something new, the better he is. He gets better each day and requires a patient, strong owner to help him through the strange people/things that he encounters along his journey through life.. He is totally worth it.",

She got pretty beat up and was taken to Maricopa County Animal Control, where they shaved her neck and treated her wounds.\nEnvy has a lot of love to give, but she does take a little time initially to warm up to strangers. Once she gets to know you, she can be your best buddy. She loves to cuddle. She also likes to go for walks and seems fascinated by birds flying by.\nShe may need extra time and patience to work through her fear issues with other dogs, which is understandable based on being attacked.\n\nIf you can give Envy an indoor forever home, please fill out our online application on our website at http://www.savingpawsrescueaz.com/adoption-form/  \n\n We will only schedule meet and greets with an approved application. We are an all-volunteer organization.  It may take a couple of days to process an application and complete reference checks.\n\nThank you for your interest in saving the life of a dog.",

We have found that he can be very pushy with other males.  He would probably do best with another female pup or two.  He loves to play and loves to run in the yard and chase squirrels and lizards! \nHe is a stinker about marking in the house so he will need to wear belly bands.  Perhaps in time it might be better, but we never guarantee that. \nHe is a sweet little cuddly boy who loves to sleep snuggled up with his foster mom. \nHe knows how to sit, down and roll over!  Cute as a bug. :)\n\n11/5/19 - Baxter's exam and x ray went well. His leg is healed and we can schedule him for his dental and neuter! We are SO excited for Baxter and SO happy we were able to save his leg. Thank you to all who donated towards his surgery and care!\n\n10/24/19 - Baxter is recovering well from his surgery. He will have xrays in a few more weeks to make sure the healing is complete. Then, a dental and neuter and he will be ready for his furever home!  He is a happy go lucky boy who would love to have at least one other fur sibling who hopefully would love to play!\n\n9/14/19 - Baxter's surgery is scheduled for September 18th. Prayers appreciated.\n\n9/4/19 - Hello Everyone. My name is Baxter, and I am a new resident at Yorkie Haven Rescue. In my previous home, there was an unfortunate incident in May and my back left leg was broken. My family was unable to get the surgery that I desperately needed. A vet put a splint on it, but it never healed. A family friend found Yorkie Haven Rescue and they agreed to help me. They say a wonderful lady who loves yorkies paid for my long trip to Houston; and, a very nice man who also loves yorkies flew with me. He was a lot of fun and very kind to me on my long journey even taking me to Starbucks for a Puppacino. It was yummy!\n\nThey say my leg is pretty messed up and that I will need bone grafting and a plate in my leg. I am hoping that the doctor can repair my leg, so I would love it if anyone reading this would say some prayers that it is still able to be fixed.\n\nAfter I have surgery and all the other vetting that I need, I hear that YHR is going to be looking for a home for me where I will be very spoiled.\n\nI am a lap baby and would love a home that either mom or dad are home a lot and want to spend time watching tv with me, talking short walks, playing outside, playing inside and napping with me. I also like going for car rides\n\nI'm a little timid with loud noises. But I'm such a tiny little tyke big noises or too much chaos scares me. A home that is relaxed and laid back with a human or humans who love to cuddle would be right up my alley. I've been around small children, but a home without them would be better for me since I'm so small and get underfoot.\n\nI hear that we are currently accepting applications for my new parent(s), but it will be a little while before I can join them. I have to be neutered, get a dental, and the main thing, fix my leg. Don't forget, say some prayers for me. I'll say some for you too.\n\nKisses, Baxter!",

He is a 5-6 year old pitty mix, weighing around 50lbs.  In his foster home he did extensive training with his foster Mom. He knows sit, lay, stay, give paw, turn, hand signals, leave it, crawl, heel, and loads more!  SO SMART!  He loves to learn new things and is very treat motivated.  He would be great for agility training or as a running partner.  He is great at fetch, tug, and loves to go in the car.  He is potty trained and kennel trained!  \n\nBilly is currently undergoing additional training at a training facility.  He can be nervous in new situations and there he can be exposed to a variety of things, learning to be more comfortable.  He is meeting people more happily in anticipation of the toys and treats they may bring him.  A patient person who gives him space, time, some yummy treats, fun toys, and lots of positive reinforcement for all the things that he's amazing at should do well.  Billy enjoys and gets along with other dogs but can be a bit rough with play so the training team can help assess whether he will be a good match with any other dogs in the home.  He has done well with both male and female dogs, large, and small dogs.  No cats please.  He has an adorable face and is really affectionate with those he knows well.  This boy will definitely come around and love you for life if you'll just give him a chance.  \n\nIf you are interested in meeting Billy, please fill out an application via our website at https://therescueproject.net/adoption-application and we will get back to you via email once your application has been reviewed.  If you have further questions please feel free to reach out to us at adoptionstrp@gmail.com\n\nBilly's adoption fee is $200 and includes age appropriate vaccines, neuter, microchip, deworm, heartworm testing and treated.",

            "description": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\nAlthough I have to be the only kid in the house, I have a huge bubbly personality to make up for it. I love long walks however I am not very good with strangers. A high fenced in yard would be best for me!\n\n*Update 12/24/2020*\n\nChevy is doing great in his foster home. He misses his daily long walks but we get out energy in the house with his toys and a bit of wrestling around. He is enjoying the gifts he has received from so many of his fans, squeaky toys galore although he plays rough and they don't last long LOL. He has a new winter coat that goes on so easy and he doesn't fuss about wearing it so that's great! He is such a snuggler now. When he first came to his foster Dad he was content sleeping/lounging solo but these last few months he has really taken to being a 60lb lap dog and quite the snuggler which to be honest is why boxers are the best! He is fine in his kennel when alone in the house, he does like to counter surf a bit though when no one is looking. Overall Chevy is a wonderful dog, He will add joy to whoever is drawn to him. He is sooo handsome if you think he might be the boxer for you please inquire, he is the best!\n\n*Update 9/10/2020*\nChevy has been taking lots of walks and working on more calm behavior when we come across other critters and people. If we can, we stop and observe until the tree kitties (squirrels) become boring and we move on. Chevy is really a snuggler during the day, at night he is a solo kind of fella and likes his space. He is really quiet at night and no surprise needs to go out. He is obedient and listens well when you have a little treat for him, he is a little stubborn in some cases but with direction he complies. Never will have a problem getting him to go for a car ride he loves to feel the wind out the window. He is really a good boy for the right home (high fence LOL). He is very athletic and high energy.\n\n*Update 8/7/2020*\nHey everyone it's Chevy checkin in! Well my first week with my new foster Dad has been wonderful! I am acclimating well to my new home and routine. I am an active boxer so I like to go for walks, roam the house or just be outside. I have met some people here and boy do I turn on the charm with wiggles and licks, I won't slobber on ya much and I have good breath LOL. My yard doesn't have a fence so I am on a leash at all times but that doesn't bother me. I did go to the dog park the other day and it was awesome to run around. There were no other dogs there which is probably for the best at this time. I do fine in the house, I go in my kennel when my foster Dad is at work. I have had a few occasions where he left me out and I behaved so I am building trust that I am a good boy. I love to snuggle and let you know I'm in the room. My health is excellent, my fur is beautiful and I love to be brushed. So there you have it.....my first week and doing well. I am looking forward to meeting people who want to meet me.\n\n*Update 5/2/2020\n*\n\nChevy is going through a training program with \"Unleashed\" they are teaching him how to be a dog, while helping us learn what he needs from his FUREVER owner! Stay tuned!\n\n*Update 2/19/2020*\n\nChevy is ready for winter to be over! While he loves to eat the snow, and loves to plow through the snow banks, he is very ready for the warm weather so he can co on longer walks. Not a lot of updates today, he hasn't had potty accidents in months which is great! We have a puppy sitter that has been visiting so they can get used to each other so we can go somewhere for a day or two without having to worry about him and those visits are going very well. We also visited a trainer this Saturday who gave us some pointers to help with training and we will be working on those on a nightly basis.\n\n*Update 1/14/2020*\n\nWith the holidays and the cold winter weather our socialization training has slowed down. In the house we continue to work on stay, leave it, and ringing the bells to go outside. Chevy has a potty routine so it's not often he has to ask to go outside so he hasn't rang the bells to go out yet, but he has been doing great in the house, no accidents in over a month! For Christmas he received some pig toys that honk, those were a hit! By far his favorite toy to date. I also found a squeaky ball that he has yet to chew apart, and he likes to pounce on it in the snow and try to dig it out which is super cute to watch\n\n*Update 11/29/2019*\n\nIf you are looking for a cuddle bug this guy is it! He absolutely loves to be on your lap, and if you are sitting next to someone he will sprawl himself out over both of you to to ensure he gets all the love! Need to move or reposition him? Just move him wherever you want he doesn't mind! One of my favorite things about him is he loves to sleep on his back with his feet up in the air, it is absolutely adorable! Chevy has also become patient with food, he is to the point I don't have to say \"Leave It\" every time I set some food on my lap, and if we eat on the couch watching TV he lays down at my feet and waits patiently for a bite. Some more good news, we've met the trainer twice and she noticed a good change in how responsive he was to on leash commands! We are still working on socializing with people as well, it can be a bit scary for him at first since he is not used to meeting new people but treats are a quick way to make any stranger his friend! :)\n\n*Update 11/162019*\nChevy is becoming quite the well-rounded house dog I knew he could become! He sits and waits for me to put his food down for meals, he is learning to \"leave it\" and not touch food if I am sitting by him with it or set it in front of him and won't touch it until I give him the ok. We haven't had a potty accident in the house in over a week now that we understand his bathroom needs and he is still learning to ring the bell to go outside. We allow him to roam the house with restrictions while we are at work and as long as food, dishes, or anything enticing is out of reach he mostly sleeps throughout the day until we get home. He absolutely LOVES car rides, if you leave your car door open you are guaranteed to find him in there waiting if he can sneak in. He loves playing with his toys, the squeakier the better and is getting really good at sitting and waiting for me to throw the toy when I take it from him. He's been doing good with people lately, he's still cautious of some new people but once he warms up he just wants to be pet by everyone.\n\nWe also recently started to work with a trainer to get him more social with other dogs, the first session went great and we were able to walk him past the trainer's dog, and have her walk past him real close without him barking or lunging! It will take repetition for him to be calm and confident around other dogs but to see such a change in the one session shows he is capable and willing to do better! :)\n\n*Update 10/31/2019*\n\nChevy is working hard to become the \"Goodest of Boys\". We had a few potty accidents last week but have been good again this week. We have recently learned how to \"Give\" and let go of toys when asked, however he gets quite excited about new toys and doesn't want to give them up so I use treats as a trade off so I can take the toy. We are working on bell training to go outside, he knows how to ring the bell, now we need to learn how to ring it to go potty outside. Chevy is learning to sit and wait for his food, I make him \"stay\" until I set it down, and we are working on \"stay\" as a general command as well and he is catching on! Chevy used to jump up often out of excitement or if you have food but now he sits more often than jumping as he has learned that sit will get him pets or the food that he wants, and only jumps on occasion now so it is still a work in progress but he has come a long way from when he first came to us! Chevy is still uncomfortable meeting dogs face to face, and has been uncomfortable with a few strangers so we are looking at utilizing a trainer to help him be more comfortable with strangers and other dogs. Overall he is a very happy and loving boy that will be happiest in a home of his own with no other dogs or cats, and older children that won't get knocked over easily if he gets a little rambunctious. He loves his toys, the squeakier the better, loves his walks, and when he isn't playing or walking he is happiest cuddled up on your lap or right next to you :)\n\n*Update 10/2/2019*\n\nChevy has been progressing nicely the past few weeks and we have learned so much about him! He loves people, but can be cautious of new people and occasionally barks at people across the street since he is unsure of who they are. When walked over to them he is more than happy to be pet by them. At night he is a little more cautious since it is harder to know who it is and does bark and growl a little more often but with a little reassurance he mellows down. In the house he wants to just crawl in your lap and be loved on by you and give you kisses.\n\nChevy did come up from Missouri with another boxer, Molly, and he enjoyed her company but he is having troubles meeting new dogs face to face and does act aggressive towards them. He has met a dog in his crate and did not react to the dog, and has sniffed a couple small dogs that were being held with no issues. At this time I still feel he will be best as an only dog so he can absorb all of your love! We have made trips to the pet store which he loves, mostly because there are lots of people, and even though he can have too much energy at home for kids he does love their attention at the store and stands nicely for their pets.\n\nThe resource guarding has decreased immensely, I can pet him while he's eating and he is nice about taking treats. if you give him a bone and you want to take it away I use another treat ",

            "description": "My Elderly Humans Had Health Problems.Bella was born about September 17, 2007 and weighs about 55 lbs. She is here because her elderly owners were having health issues and none of the relatives could offer her a home. Upon arrival she was overweight and had skin issues. She wasn't ready to leave us right away, but now she has dropped some weight and looks and, seems to feel, much better and is more active than she was. Her skin has drastically improved and, perhaps, the condition was due to stress, her food, etc. Bella may be a bit long in the tooth, but she moves well and hears and sees well for her age. She does have some lumps, bumps and a hanging thingy none of which bother her at this time. Bella did have an untreated ear infection when she came that we've treated but will likely need more care going forward. She did well going through having her teeth cleaned. She is house trained, loves car rides and has done well with visiting children in her last life. She has been amazing with all the other dogs. We are told she may have wanderlust if off leash so a fenced yard would be best or to walk her on leash and she does enjoy walks. Bella also enjoys a lot of attention from her people and we are told she loves her biscuits....which are few and far between here at the rescue which might be why she has slimmed down so well. Update: Well, we aren't always told the truth when dogs are surrendered to us and although she does well with the other dogs here she cannot be handled by humans likely why the family wouldn't take her in. Her ears remain infected, but she has decided we will NOT be treating them.\n\nDid you know that there are very special dogs and cats who call Joyful Rescues home?\n\nBella is what some may call \"un-adoptable .\" Joyful Rescues remains committed to our Sanctuary Dogs and Cats. They will stay with us for their natural lives and we will care for and love them. We will be their forever family.\n\nWe wish we could do it alone but we need your help. We are looking for people who can help us with Bellas care. Please click the link below and donate. Bella thanks you.\n\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate\n\nCan't Adopt Me?

            "description": "CeCe is a VERY special little girl. She is about 3 years old and has an amazing will to live! CeCe is Paralized in her hind end after being hit by a car. We consulted with a specialist but she was not a candidate for surgery. This injury and her paralysis doesn\u2019t stop CeCe one bit from loving and enjoying life !!! \nShe has a fantastic drive to do what all the others are doing and she wants to be with that special person who will giver her the same love that she gives them, good with all dogs big or small and good with cats. Her disability does not hold her back.\nCeCe has a wheelchair provided by the rescue but she does great just scooting around. She is in diapers, so please understand this is a commitment, as she doesn\u2019t have control over her bladder and bowels. \nCeCe is spayed and UTD on vaccines and microchipped. Her adoption fee is $250 and applications can be found at www.snarrnortheast.org\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFAQs -- PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE EMAILING\n\n**Please note that SNARR NE is a volunteer-based organization. While our volunteers will try to respond to you as quickly as possible, it is helpful if you review the following information about our adoption process before emailing:**\n\n- LISTED BREED(S) & AGE: We are taking our best guess on age, breed, and size when fully grown, based on the puppy's/dog's physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. *NOTE* We rarely know a dog's exact age, nor are we able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. Because we often do not have access to medical records at the time that we are posting dogs to Petfinder, so there are sometimes discrepancies between what is posted on Petfinder and what might be listed on a dog's medical records.\n\n- SNARR'S ADOPTION PROCESS: The first step in adopting or meeting a SNARR dog/puppy is to fill out an application at www.snarrnortheast.org/applications. Once we receive your application, one of our adoption application processors will contact you, review our adoption process with you, and answer any additional questions you may have. **We do not go on a first-come-first-serve basis for adoptions, but on best fit for a family and most importantly the puppy or dog.**\n\n- MEETING ADOPTABLE DOGS: Meet and greets will not be scheduled until after your adoption application has been fully processed by one of our adoption processors.\n\n- APPLYING ONLINE: If you fill out an online application, please do so from a computer (not a mobile device), make sure you answer ALL the questions in as much detail as possible, and that you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive a confirmation email, that means we did NOT receive your application.\n\n- PUPPIES: We do suggest listing a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice on your application if applying for a puppy with several litter mates.\n\n- ADOPTION FEES:  $495 for puppies / $425 for adults / Adoption Fees for Seniors, Special Needs and Bonded Pairs vary\n\n\n",

            "description": "Watson is a 2 year old, 15 pound Chihuahua mix. He came to us in September 2019. Why has he been with us so long? His main issue is he does not do well with strangers. He bonds deeply with his people, but doesn't like most people when he first meets them - it will take several visits for him to trust you. But once he does, he will be the sweetest, most affectionate dog! He loves to sit on your lap, jump up and greet you, and smother your face in kisses. He is pretty tolerant of other dogs, but when his human is around, he only has eyes for them. He loves to play and go for walks; if you are active, Watson will be a great partner. We would prefer him to go to a dog savvy home with a fenced yard and no kids. If you can get past his grumpy exterior, you will not regret putting in the time with this guy. \n\nIf you wish to be considered for this animal, please download an application at http://fallstonanimalrescue.org/adopt/ or email fallstonrescue@aol.com to request one. It can take up to 2 weeks to process an application; we suggest following up by email on the status if you have not received a reply within 3-5 days. We are an all-volunteer based rescue and we ask for your patience if we are slow to respond. \n\nPlease understand that we fit the dog with the home we feel is best suited and will accept multiple applications for one dog. We have strict requirements for families with children under 10 since many of our dogs are grumpy and may not do well with children. Some dogs will have fence requirements, while others may not. It is preferred you are within a 2 hour drive from our Rescue Center in Fallston, MD.\n\nA pet is a lifetime commitment and it is our duty to do our very best to place them correctly the first time around. We do not take the adoption process lightly. Thank you for choosing to adopt not shop!\n\n",

            "description": "Viktor is currently fostered in Mentor Ohio, and his adoption fee/donation is $150\n\nVictor update 4/23/2020\n\nVictor has really settled down A LOT in his foster home!! In fact he has really bonded with one of his foster fur brothers (Jasper) The two of them have become like peas and carrots!! They do everything TOGETHER! Sleep together, play, run, chase, practically attached at the hip. We are so impressed with how well he is doing. However we recently had him stay with a different foster home for a day or two, just to see how he did away from his normal environment, and away from Jasper. We wanted to test him, and see if he was ok, and not revert back to the old \u201cFERAL VICTOR\u201d Well unfortunately he reverted back to acting extremely feral in the new foster home. \nHe would not allow anyone in the house to touch him, he constantly ran away from any and all human interaction. He would find a corner to hide in and just shake and tremble for hours. Once they were able to get him outside in a fenced yard, he kept running around the yard, trying to get away, and it took over an hour to get him back in the house. \nVictor CANNOT be leashed to this day. If his foster tries to put a leash on him, he freaks out, and pulls, thrashes trying to escape his collar to get away. After trying the different environment, we had to get him back to his original foster, we couldn\u2019t let him be freaked out like he was any longer. Once he was back \u201cHOME\u201d he went right back to being his happy self, and was SO HAPPY to be back with his Buddy Jasper!!! \nHe is going to need a very experienced, special adopter, one that has a SECURED fenced in yard, this is a MUST, there are NO EXCEPTIONS!!! They will need to have at least one or two other dogs for him to bond with, as he cant handle being an only dog, because of his feral background. The best case scenario for victor, would be to get adopted along with his buddy jasper (2 yr cocker spaniel special needs). It would be the best possible home for him, but we realize this is not an easy thing to do, it is our wish though, that this could happen for both of them. \n\nOriginal Bio\nHi there, My name is Viktor, I am a beagle mix of some sort, and I am only 1 yr old. I had a rough start in life, I was born in the wild to feral mother dog, and the animal warden had to trap me to catch me!!! I was so fearful of humans, I had no social skills at all, and took quite some time to come around when being near humans. I am happy to report, that I am now ready for adoption!! I am able to be petted, loved on, and live like a real dog, isn\u2019t that so cool!! I am living with many other foster brothers and sisters, the four-legged kind that is. I get along well with them, and like to play, I still have a ways to go when it comes to being leashed, and walking without freaking out!! \nI will need a forever home that has at least one other dog, because I get my confidence from them, it\u2019s a comfort mechanism for me, and I would be sad if I were alone without another dog as a friend.  I need to be in a fenced in yard when I go outside, I am learning about something called housetraining, and I think I am catching on. I do my business outside when my foster mom puts me out, but I do still occasionally make a mistake. I am used to my crate, and I stay in there every day when my foster mom works, you see it keeps me out of trouble!! I am a small dog, only about 20 lbs, I am full grown, and will not get any bigger, so if you are looking for smaller, then I could be your dog!! \nOh, I do have a bad habit of chewing things, so I am told I am not supposed to do that. I like to chew, its fun, but these humans tell me that is NOT NICE, and I get into trouble when I chew up something.I will work on being a good boy, I promise, I just need to be trained I guess, can you help me? I will give you lots of love in return!!!\nViktor is neutered, current on vaccines, and is heartworm negative.\n\nIf you would like to adopt Viktor or would like more information on him, please fill out an adoption application\nWe do not have a shelter, all rescues are in foster homes - Dogs are not shown without first being approved to adopt.\nComplete an Adoption Application Here\nwww.cherishedcockers.org/adoptionapp.htm\nIf you have any questions, please E-mail Cherished Cockers Rescue\nAdoption Donation (vet bill-expenses), Home Visit, Adoption Contract, References Required.\nWe do not ship dogs.Pet needs to be picked up at foster home.In some cases we may be able to assist with transport. \nWe would love to have more foster volunteers so we can rescue and rehome more cocker spaniels. If you are interested in fostering or learning more about it, please complete a Foster Application Here and one of our wonderful volunteers will be in touch!\nwww.cherishedcockers.org/foster.htm\nFor more information Cherished Cockers Rescue\nwww.cherishedcockers.org",

            "description": "Patches was born in early 2014 and is a black & white pointer / hound mix. Patches is a very smart boy and knows not only the basic commands, but many others as well. Patches has difficulty meeting new people and dogs. It can take quite a bit of time to for him to be comfortable and to trust. Because of this he has been at the AAF shelter longer than any of our dogs - since early 2015. However, once you are in his \"\"circle of trust\"\" Patches can be quite the lover and a great friend. Patches needs to go to a loving home with only adults and no cats.\n\nIn light of current events, adoptions are available by appointment only. An adoption application can be submitted online for any desired pet by going to http://www.aafpets.org/adopt-a-pet/. If the app is approved, we will contact you to set up an appointment!Thank you for considering adopting a pet from the Animal Adoption Foundation.\nAll AAF cats and dogs are vaccinated, spayed or neutered and microchipped. All cats receive a FelV/FIV combination test while dogs over the age of 8 months are tested for heartworms. All pets are also treated for both intestinal parasites and fleas. The AAF is proud of the medical attention that is given to each and every pet as their health and well-being is of the utmost importance to our organization. \nThe adoption fee for our pets is as follows:\nKittens: $85\nCats 5 Months and older: $60\nPuppies: $150\nDogs 5 Months and older: $135\nYou can visit this and all of our pets available for adoption:\nTuesday-Friday 4 PM - 7 PM\t\nSaturday and Sunday 1 PM- 4 PM",

He's soft mouthed with treats and toys. He loves a good romp with his big foster sis but thoroughly enjoys snuggle and one on one time. While he'd prefer and does well sleeping at your feet in bed, he's also happy anywhere you let him have a fleece blanket and his stuffed toy. His best friend is the cat but will need intro to any new kitties with patience (it took ours about 2 weeks to completely warm up and he's fairly outgoing towards dogs). Pete also serves as a doorbell, so you'll never have to worry about replacing those batteries again! He's warmed up well to all house guests thus far after a treat and a good pat. Does well with older kids-probably 10+ yrs\nIf we didn't live in town and have 2 dogs already, this boy would not be up for adoption because we LOVE him and his goofy personality.To access our online adoption application copy and paste the url into your browser: https://service.sheltermanager.com/asmservice?account=zw1754&method=online_form_html&formid=41",

            "description": "Update from Opal's foster mom 10/18/20\n\nOnce Opal is up, she's actually pretty mobile and has times when she runs around our yard and house. But, when she first gets up in the morning or after a long nap, she clearly struggles to get moving. Sometimes her back legs slip out from under her. Steps are a challenge. Opal definitely needs a home where there are no more than three steps to the outside. I've put a ramp on our porch stairs and she does really well with it. If you find a potential adopter, I would be happy to give them the ramp.\n\nOpal is definitely housetrained, but because of her age she sometimes can't make it to the door in time -- particularly first thing in the morning or after a long nap. She's had quite a few accidents in the house. I know she doesn't mean to -- she just can't get out in time. Potential adopters will need to be patient with her about this. I've found that it helps to be right there when she wakes up in the morning (or after a nap) and help her get to the door in time. It's also important for her to have a reliable schedule -- she has responded really well to knowing what to expect day-to-day. A reliable schedule also helps her cope with her limited vision.\n\nIt is amazing how quickly Opal adapts to new situations. She gets along great with our three dogs and cat. She's a very easy-going, chill girl. But, I sense that she would be happiest in a home where there aren't so many active dogs. I think she'd like to enjoy her golden years in a quieter, slower-paced home environment. \n\n\nOpal is a 12 year old Beagle, she weighs 33 pounds.  \n\nA Good Samaritan brought her to our Veterinarian's office after they found her standing in the middle of a busy road.  We immediately took her into our rescue and made sure she didn't have any serious injuries.  \n\nOpal is such a sweet senior girl.  She does have a heart murmur but it is on the low end.  She has cataracts in her eyes which makes it hard for her to see.  She can hear, but it is limited also.  Opal has some fatty tumors and growths on her body but the doctor feels that none of them are anything to worry about.  \n\nShe has a great temperament and a healthy appetite.  She would love a warm, safe home to be adopted into so she can enjoy the remaining years she has left.  \n\nPlease fill out an application if you would like to meet Opal.",

We may dismiss the application if this is not completed.\n\u2022 Volunteers handle dozens of applications at a time so we do not guarantee contact with everyone. We try our best, but we are working around jobs, kids, and of course, dogs.  \n\u2022Adoptions generally take longer than 4 days to process but there is no set time frame. We do the best we can as a non-profit, so please be patient.\n\nWe currently do not adopt out of state (or more than 3 hours away) unless the dog in question has limited options and has been waiting for an extended period of time in our rescue. In most cases of puppies, we have so many applications it makes little sense to transport them out of area and use more resources up to do so. With that in mind, we have limited our out-of-state options to those who have less applicants coming in.\n\nDogs are individuals and have specific needs. We evaluate each of our dogs and develop adopter criteria for each one in order for adoptions to be successful \u2014 for life. These are often non-negotiable if listed on the dogs individual profile.\nSome requirements that may be listed are as follows:\n\n\u2022 Homeownership vs. renting\n\n\u2022 Fully-fenced yards vs. non- fenced; invisible fence is never allowed\n\n\u2022 Training with a professional force-free/positive reinforcement trainer\n\n\u2022 Cohabitation restrictions (cats, dogs, small animals, young children, etc.)\n\n\u2022 No indoor smoking (all adoptions)\n\nYour current pets must be spayed or neutered in order to be considered as an adopter. They must also be seen regularly by a veterinarian to ensure responsible pet ownership. Our mission is to ensure the safety of all of our dogs and help to end unnecessary euthanasia due to over breeding/overpopulation, and thus we must ensure that our potential adoptive homes are compatible with those goals. We have made exceptions for severe medical conditions or age that would make spay or neuter procedures risky.",

She loves to snuggle, give you kisses and admire you when you're eating. \n\nBella has Aortic Stenosis, so she does well with leisurely short walks, about 10 to 20 minutes at a time, but she won't say no if you take her out more than once a day. Her heart condition has improved significantly with a small dose of medicine that she takes twice a day in her nonfat yogurt \"treat.\" \n\nBella is gentle and gets along with all dogs and humans. She doesn't even bother cats! Sadly, she lost her forever home when her person got ill from dementia. Bella is hard of hearing but watches her person closely and will stick close, interrupting yoga sessions with kisses. \n\nShe would love a home where she is with her human or humans a lot of the time. She will assertively get on the couch but won't mind if you squeeze in next to her. She also will put her paws on your legs when you're sitting and stand on you for attention, love and kisses. And she will smile as she does it. \n\nBella does like other dogs and enjoys meeting her different \"boyfriends\" when out and about on walks. \n\nBella came to POMDR after her person was no longer able to care for her due to dementia.",

He is good with other dogs, merrily following his foster sibling around. He is comfortable meeting new people and is happy to be picked up and cuddled. He really is a love bug! Carlos is a mellow guy with long legs and the softest fur. He walks nicely on leash too. Carlos has a heart murmur and is on medication to keep his heart as healthy as possible. Carlos is a special needs dog because he does have seizures from coughing fits. This has been controlled and we are able to keep his seizures at bay. Yes, he has medical issues but is a loving and happy dog that deserves adoring people. He loves to be with you wherever you are and is totally loyal. Carlos came to us from Salinas Animal Services.",

He isn't a big fan of kitties and would do best in a home without them. He has lived with older children and done well with them. \n\nHarold has a heart murmur that will need to be monitored for the rest of his life, but it currently doesn't slow him down one bit. \n\nHarold came to us from the SPCA for Monterey County after being picked up as a stray by one of our volunteers.",

            "description": "Duke is a handsome 5-6 year-old white German Shepherd that weighs 90 pounds. This sweet boy is fully-trained by a great trainer, K9 Coach OJ \u2013 he knows all his basic commands and is very obedient. He walks like a dream right by his person and doesn\u2019t pull much \u2013 unless the owner lets him \u2013 and doesn\u2019t react when walking by other dogs unless they are barking at him. He is a calm dog but loves going out for walks and exploring the great outdoors. Duke enjoys going on car rides and once in the car he moves around a little, out of curiosity, but after a while he calms down.\nIn his foster home, Duke has shown that he is housebroken and knows how to use a doggie door. He is crate-trained and a crate is not a punishment for this sweet dog: he likes it, and if you leave the crate door open, you will find him hanging in there from time to time. Duke lives in a foster home with a few other dogs of both small- and large-size and does well with all of them. We have been informed that in his previous home, before the shelter, there were cats and he did well with them. Since we\u2019ve saved him and he\u2019s been under our care, he has not been around cats, but just looking at his sweet temperament we expect that he will probably be ok with cats, but it\u2019s always good to be cautious at the beginning. \nWhat type of home does Duke need? \nEven though he sounds perfect, our boy has some behavioral issues and needs an owner who is willing to work with him along those lines. His issue is called Resource Guarding.\nHe will need an adult-only home, preferably a solo owner and NO kids (even though he seems friendly with kids, we will not adopt him to a home with kids). \nHe is a calm dog that will do best in a home with a yard. Duke  needs to be fed alone \u2013 his future owner needs to give him the food and leave the room, because he will not share his food with people - you cannot walk by him while he is eating. Also, he is not allowed to have toys or bones, as he will not share them with people and will snap.\nHis future owner needs to be firm but gentle and loving, as Duke does not like to be handled roughly. Duke is a kind, sensitive boy, and he expects the same from his person. His future owner needs to set some rules once Duke arrives at his new home. He is a very smart boy, so he has a tendency to take control if he realizes he can do it, so an owner who sets boundaries from day one will be the best type of home for him. He needs to sleep in the crate and he doesn\u2019t mind it at all. His future owner needs to be an alpha and his leader - otherwise, the relationship won\u2019t work.\n",

Every morning, she begins the day with a ritual: she sits and presses herself into her foster mom\u2019s chest, getting a long pet and a face massage, complete with piggy snorts and her chin on her FM\u2019s shoulder. If you need a buddy for your morning mindfulness or coffee, Sapphire volunteers (but please don\u2019t stop petting her!). Massages, snuggles, and pats are always welcome in Sapphire\u2019s book, and she\u2019s made a name for herself as \u201cBest Hugger\u201d once she gets to know you. \n\nBut it\u2019s not all rest and relaxation for Sapphire! She has an adventurous side, too, and is happy to go on nice neighborhood walks, or her favorite thing: Car rides! (Seriously, she\u2019ll try to get in any open car door--so make sure it\u2019s yours!) She loves to be in the car, letting the nice windy sniffs and smells wash over her. She\u2019ll happily accompany you for car adventures to scenic overlooks or meandering hikes. \n\nAt home, Sapphire has nice house manners and enjoys relaxing and helping out with taste testing snacks--she enjoys pretty much anything, including veggies that she loves to crunch! She\u2019ll show you her silly side, too, with little zooms and spurts of energy complete with tip-tapping toenails that will make you smile.\n\nSapphire received 6 weeks of training from our partners at the Paws For Life prison training program. With a little consistency and structure, she makes for a fantastic best friend. Sapphire would prefer to be the only pet in the home--it\u2019s for the best, because she will keep you busy with all the hugging, massages, and snuggling your heart could ever desire!\n\nYou can check out Sapphire in action on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/papapawwow/\n\nAbout 5 years old and 50 pounds, Sapphire is crate-trained, house-trained, micro-chipped, up to date on routine vaccinations and knows her basic commands.",

There's a treatment that is not as hard on the dog as the one you may have heard of and it's FREE.\n\nWe answer all emails back within 48 hours. Please watch your spam folders as an application will be attached and this sometimes places it in there. \n\nHIS/HER adoption fee is $550 USD and that will pay for TRANSPORT, all his/her shots up to date, neutered/spayed, microchip and rabies.\n\nPlease e-mail MuttsAndMeows@Mail.com for an adoption application. \n\nThis dog is currently in the Houston Texas area.  Once the application is approved and adoption fee paid, transport will be arranged.\n\nBecause this adoption will be without meeting the dog first, we will need to try to be extra careful that everyone (including you) think this will be a good fit.  We will try to give you as much information about the dog as we can.  Unfortunately, many are fresh from the shelter and we don't know much about them yet. \n\nLike us on Facebook - search Mutts & Meows - and help even more pets find loving homes.",

She has successfully gone through treatment is now negative and on prevention. She was also spayed and brought utd on her vaccines. She is 5 years old and has not had the greatest life so far but we hope we can find her a special home to change all that. She does have some nervous energy and anxieties. She would do best in a home where her new family is home often. She just wants to give lots of hugs. She does live in a home with other dogs but would do best as an only dog as she can get upset when others want to get overly excited.",

            "description": "Dally is a shy Tiger Jindo mix with a sad beginning. He was found on the streets of Apple Valley with his mom, dad Darry, and 3 siblings, including Ponyboy and Sodapop. They were all wary of humans and appeared to have limited familiarity with them. The family was taken in to the local shelter, and the mom and smallest sibling were adopted quickly. The other 4 made it to TBL where they received socialization while waiting their forever homes. Dally was the shyest of the bunch, slowest to trust, and also the most unique looking. He has a handsome caramel swirl coat and beautiful, soulful green-brown eyes. Dally will need a patient and loving family to help him warm up to the world and come out of his fear-hardened shell. He will be worth the time and effort though, as he is quite the obedient, loving, and sweet and easygoing pup with his foster mom of 6+ years. Dally would do best in a home with another dog to show him the ropes and prove to him that his humans can be trusted. Dally is a great medium size of about 30 pounds, and he is about 7 and a half years old as of spring 2020. We would love to see this Classic Barker go to a well-deserved forever home! \n\nIf you'd like to meet Dally, please visit www.thebarkinglot.net/adoptTo initiate the adoption process for this dog, please complete our online application by clicking below. Your adoption coordinator will respod to you via email once they receive your application: www.thebarkinglot.net/adopt",

            "description": "Looking for a silly, outgoing, spunky and fun-loving Bassett Hound and Boston Terrier mix to brighten your days? Then Heron may just be your guy! Heron originally came to us from a shelter in San Bernardino County, and he quickly made fast friends with everyone both two and four legged. His favorite pastimes at TBL include roaming the play yard with his buddies, playing fetch, going on weekend hikes with volunteers, and just being a ham for attention. You only need to meet him to know that this playful dude has a happy-go-lucky outlook on life and nothing will bring him down. Given his energy and tenacity, he would do best with an experienced owner that can keep him grounded and help set boundaries. Heron loves to give you kisses - whether your hands, arms, or face, he is not picky! He comes equipped with adorably squat legs, classic black and white coloring, constantly wagging tail, big inquisitive brown eyes, and happy smiling face. To those who know him well, and those he has established trust with, he is a very sweet, jolly, and obedient boy. Heron weighs around 30 pounds, a great size for most types of living situations. He is about 8 and a half years young (estimated DOB December 2011) but can still keep up with the best of them on long hikes and outdoor adventures. If Heron sounds like the perfect pup you have been looking for, come see if he is a match for you!\n\nIf you'd like to meet Heron, please visit www.thebarkinglot.net/adoptTo initiate the adoption process for this dog, please complete our online application by clicking below.

            "description": "Papaya came to us from Moreno Valley Shelter along with his brother Wrasse. Both were feral, and it has taken some time for them to open up to volunteers. However, Papaya is the more outgoing one of the pair, and he has been making great strides in his foster home! Papaya has an estimated DOB of June 2018 and he is a great compact size of around 30 pounds. The brothers are both skittish and need help building up trust and confidence around people. Papaya has grown comfortable around familiar volunteers and now greets them with a wagging tail! (This could also be because he's come to learn they come with treats). He is now in foster and while he's a great walker, he's still working on being comfortable interacting with his people in the home. He is fantastic with other dogs of all shapes and sizes and would likely do well in a home where a more confident dog can show him the ropes!\n\nIf you'd like to meet Papaya, please visit www.thebarkinglot.net/adoptTo initiate the adoption process for this dog, please complete our online application by clicking below.

This sweet-faced Boxer mix was found as a stray. She has been so great with other dogs that she is often invited to be one of our front office greeters where she hangs out with other pups of all shapes and sizes. Pfeifer is a smart cookie. She already has some basic commands under her belt, and even knows how to roll over on command! Pfeifer has proven herself to be a great hiking buddy on K9rs adventures all over the county. She will do best with an experienced owner who can provide her with guidance so she can be the best version of herself. She is the kind of dog who responds well to calm and assertive leadership, is easily corrected, and loves training. Pfeifer is a great medium size of 45 pounds, and she is just under 6 years old as of spring 2020. Come see if Pfeifer is the right fit for you!\n\nIf you'd like to meet Pfeifer, please visit www.thebarkinglot.net/adopt.To initiate the adoption process for this dog, please complete our online application by clicking below.

            "description": "It's easy to love young dogs, but senior dogs need homes too! Older dogs like Captain Crunch here have the toughest time of all in the shelter system because he is constantly being overlooked by potential families. He may be slow and scarred, but he is still sweet as can be and more than capable of being a loving companion. Captain Crunch enjoys going on walks, exploring sights and sounds, chewing on a few blades of grass, and getting some chin scratches in between. While Captain Crunch is a favorite among our volunteer walkers, it's not the same as being able to sleep on a dog bed inside a warm home to call his own. He is 11 years young (estimated DOB January 2009), and he has been at The Barking Lot for over a year now. Crunchy, as he is affectionately dubbed, is also great with other dogs. He currently plays in a group with all \"\"littles\"\", and it's the cutest thing. Many of his little buddies are puppies and they help keep him young. Crunchy has bad arthritis and he is on a special diet. Do you have room in your home and heart for Captain Crunch? If so, please submit an application on our website today - he is waiting for you!\n\nIf you'd like to meet this pup, please visit www.thebarkinglot.net/adoptTo initiate the adoption process for this dog, please complete our online application by clicking below.

            "description": "Sparrow is the last of the Pirate Puppies awaiting his home! He was born in April 2018 to a sweet Schnauzer mama. Sparrow is our special boy and holds a big place in the hearts of all the TBL volunteers. You see, Sparrow is a distemper survivor. He took the viral illness the hardest of his siblings, and it left him with a pretty sever involuntary muscle tic that renders him incapable of walking. It's as if he has a case of chronic hiccups. As such, Sparrow is a very low-key and low-maintenance pup as he spends most of his day napping and people-watching from his favorite cushion. Sparrow has been affectionately nicknamed \"\"inchworm\"\", and if you met him in person, you would understand. While it can be heart-wrenching for some to see a puppy with an ongoing muscle twitch, rest assured, Sparrow is in the company of many puppy playmates and is showered by lots of attention from volunteers. He is a gentle, even-keeled, quiet, loving, and sweet boy. There is a chance that with time, his muscle tic can diminish somewhat in severity. For now, Sparrow will patiently await the right family who can see past his disability and love him for the sweet sweet soul that he is!\n\nIf you'd like to meet this pup, please visit www.thebarkinglot.net/adoptTo initiate the adoption process for this dog, please complete our online application by clicking below. Your adoption coordinator will respod to you via email once they receive your application: www.thebarkinglot.net/adopt",

She is an expert at fetch, she will find the ball no matter where you throw it, and drop it right at your feet. Tug of war is another favorite of hers and one of the best things to watch is her playing tug of war between kennels with other dogs\u2019 blankets. She for sure is the blanket thief and sometimes will have three of them in her kennel all made into a little nest with her right in the middle. \n\nPresley is about 9 years old and has had a bit of a hard life. We think she may have been hit by a car at some point and takes joint supplements but still has a lot of energy and just loves to run and play!\n\n\n*Dogs Unbroken supports Colorado dogs at higher risk for euthanasia evaluating their behavioral stability and applying training methods appropriate for their needs. The goal of helping each dog learn to make good choices in challenging situations. We help connect dogs and people to create a safe and confident home life. Continued training in Longmont, Colorado is mandatory but included in any foster to adopt situation with any of our dogs.

We are so thankful to amazing vets who saved her life. Gracie lives every day to its fullest. It is like she knows that she was so close to losing her life. She sure is an itty-bitty pittie but she doesn\u2019t know it. She has such a huge personality and tons of love to give. She was never a pet and isn\u2019t sure how to play with toys like other dogs but sure loves to run and will play with her humans in her own way. We can\u2019t wait for Gracie to be loved in a home of her own! \n\n\n\n*Dogs Unbroken supports Colorado dogs at higher risk for euthanasia evaluating their behavioral stability and applying training methods appropriate for their needs. The goal of helping each dog learn to make good choices in challenging situations. We help connect dogs and people to create a safe and confident home life. Continued training in Longmont, Colorado is mandatory but included in any foster to adopt situation with any of our dogs.

I need to find a life partner while I can still shake it. I need to be an only dog, but I like people and kids. I have beautiful golden eyes that will get you drunk on my love and possibly get me a few meatballs too. I haven\u2019t been   exposed to felines so I don\u2019t know how I will react, just being honest. I am house broken and crate trained. My bags are packed and I am available to crash on your couch immediately. Call or text Evelyn\u2019s Place Rescue at 770-503-5402 or  678-776-6244 if you would like to meet me for a coffee (water on the rocks), lunch (good dog snacks) or for a romp at the park. \n",

            "description": "Harris is a handsome 2 year old Belgium Malinois mix who will need a quiet home with few visitors. Due to his breed, Harris is an excellent watchdog and protector. Therefore, he would not do well with children under the age of 12 and would need to be the only dog in the household.\n\nHarris loves to be outside, go for walks and TRIES to play with the squirrels! A 6 ft fence would be needed as he is an awesome jumper! He is housebroke and kennel trained, although he gets pretty excited when his human comes home. Positive reinforcement training needs to continue for this guy.\n\nHarris needs time to feel safe with new people. Interested adopters should expect a few meetings for Harris to get to know them. A trainer will be a part of the process to help Harris and his new owners work well together.\n\nThe suggested adoption donation for Harris is $350, which is TAX DEDUCTIBLE, and goes toward providing supportive services to animals in the home, as well as the high cost of vetting our dogs in rescue. If you would like to welcome Harris into your home, please begin by submitting our adoption application.The adoptions for all of our dogs will take place in the Omaha, NE area and must be done by the adoptive family in person. We do not ship or deliver the dogs.\n\nPlease Note: We are a RESCUE, which is different from a shelter. We conduct veterinary and personal reference checks during the application approval process. We always select the right applicant for each dog, based on the dogs needs. If you and the dog are not a good match, we will help you select another dog, or we will keep your approved application on file for 6 months.\n\nIf you would like to learn more about Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue, or donate to our dogs, please visit our website at MuddyPawsSecondChanceRescue.com. We invite you to visit our Facebook Page, and when you visit, please don't forget to Like our Facebook page so that you wont miss any information about our dogs and events!",

Please email Paw Printz directly if you are interested in Luca at: PawPrintzRescue@gmail.com Luca is one of those dogs whose picture you see online and fall so madly in love with him you think you couldn't love him anymore. Then you meet him, and your heart explodes. He is that lovable. Luca is a little shy at first, he has had his heart broken by unworthy people in the past, so patience with him at first is the best way to win his heart. But once he warms up, you get the full Luca experience. He will adore you just as much as you adore him, 70 pounds of total adoration, devotion and kisses. Had a bad day? Luca can help. He can lounge around and watch a movie with you or lift your spirits with a little rousing game of fetch and tag in the backyard with his Kong. He will plop his big fat head in your lap, look up at you with those gorgeous green eyes and you can see how much he loves you and wants to make life better for you. This guy will touch your soul and you will know love. His favorite toy is his Kong. When he is nervous it acts like a binky for him. He is very smart and listen well. He just wants to please and make his person happy. Luca is a Mastiff/Bully mix about 3 or 4 years old (as of 2018). He weighs in around 70 pounds, which is all solid muscle. He is neutered, current on vaccinations, microchipped, good with properly introduced dogs, but especially good with the ladies. His has beautiful green eyes and a shiny. gorgeous fawn colored coat with white markings. He hasn't had any prior experience with cats so we suggest a home without any feline companions, or maybe a very dog savvy cat. He is house trained, crate trained, good on a leash, knows basic obedience (but can have a bout of 'bully hearing' when sniffing something especially interesting in the yard lol), loves car rides and is an all around good dog. Because of his size, we recommend a home without small children. He can get very exuberant in his play and may accidentally knock small children down. We want both Luca and his new family to be happy so a home experienced with bully breeds is a must. Adoption Process: Application, Interview, Homecheck Adoption Fee: $250",

All he wants is a big soft dog bed next to yours and LOTS of LOVE and PLAYTIME!\n\nThe dog/cat adoption fee, which is normally $60 unless we are having a special, includes spay or neuter, MICROCHIP, age-appropriate shots and health check.

All meet and greets are arranged only AFTER an application is submitted and reviewed.\u00a0\n\nSeymour is an incredibly sweet boy but he needs a strong owner.  Seymour is approximately 7 years old.  Seymour would do best as an ONLY dog!   Seymour loves toys, these are a must for this handsome hound.  We have found that as incredibly sweet and loving he can be, he also likes to be the boss,! :)   Seymour is crating well in his foster home, he's very smart and adjusts to routine quickly.  Seymour would do best in a structured and routine environment.  Seymour will require a 6-foot fence or a home where he will be leash walked for potty breaks.  He is a sweet boy, we would like to find him a forever home to give this sweet guy stability and a forever home.  Seymour requires a home with NO SMALL CHILDREN.\n\nIf you would like more information regarding Seymour or other Greyt Angels, please email greytangels@gmail.com.\n\nWe LOVE the support and interest of every inquiry on our hounds!!! At this time, however, we are a smaller group, so we must limit our adoptions to a 2-hour radius of our home base of Goshen, Indiana. This enables us to better provide support to our adopters and our hounds, when needed, for a more successful adoption experience!",

            "description": "Hi everyone. My name is Addison. You are probably staring at my dreamy eyes and already realizing we might be a match. Before you sink any deeper, I want to tell you my story; unfortunately, it was not always filled with happiness. I was abandoned in a Walmart parking lot, yep, a PARKING LOT. I needed urgent medical attention that my rescuers couldn't afford, so they desperately looked for help. Thankfully, PAWS4you stepped up. Not going to lie, they saved my life. The events that transpired and brought me to where I am today made me realize how important love is. I never stopped loving humans, even if they failed me in the past. My dream is to find a family that will want to share their home and hearts with me. I'd love to snuggle on the couch or bed with all the adults and children. You read right, I love children! I am a people pleaser, your future best friend, and an excellent toy-fetcher. What are you waiting for? Adopt me!\n\nTo adopt, fill out an application at\n\nwww.paws4you.org/application\n\nTo get our newsletter, text\nPAWS4YOU\nto\n22828\n\nConnect with us:\n\nwww.instagram.com/paws4you\n\nwww.twitter.com/paws4you\n\nwww.facebook.com/paws4you",

She is not a perfect young lady, however, I know she is perfect for someone.\n\nHello, my name is Sarabi. My foster momma named me that because she says I am a beautiful Queen (even though she picked me up from the local pound when I was only 6 months old). I have been in foster for a long time... my foster momma loves me lots and I love her. I was diagnosed when I was just over a year old as having congenital luxating patellas. Basically my knees weren't working properly and that caused a cruciate ligament tear to both of my back legs. I have had successful surgeries to both and have fully recuperated. My legs work well for walks and play, but like humans who have surgeries like this, I have arthritis in both and just need some supplements and sometimes some medicine for swelling and pain (not very much).\n\nI love my humans so much that I do not want to share them with any other pet. I want them and their space to myself. I am reactive towards other dogs, comes off as aggression, but I truly want to play. My foster mommy can take me on walks with other dogs because I can redirect pretty well at her command and we stay at a little distance. I cannot live with any other animal though, or go to dog parks, or socialize with other dogs at public or private places. I need my humans to love me as much as I love them. I like to bark at squirrels and cats.\n\nI am loving to every human. My foster momma says that I am too happy! I do jump on people and when really excited I do mouth. Small kids may get hurt around me, but I wouldn't mean to. I would love to be with people who will make me feel like their very own. I love to walk, play in the yard with my jolly ball toys (and momma), and to lounge on my Kuranda bed while mom does yard work. Don't start the mower thingy or the weed whipper thing with me in the yard though... they drive me bezerk!\n\nWhen you leave for work, I must be put in my kennel. Don't be sad, it is to keep me safe and to make sure that I don't get into anything you dont want me to. I am good in there... and when you get home, I will be soooooo happy to see you!\n\nI have other stuff I know I should write, but momma says to take a break cuz the tears keep coming. Please do NOT put in an application for me unless you can promise no other animals, and no little children can live with me. Please also know that I will need a yard with a fence... must be fully fenced. It is so I cannot get out and hurt any other animal... please promise to keep me safe and loved forever! That is the most important of all.\n\nSubmit an adoption application on our website mattysheartandsoulanimalrescue.rescuegroups.org.",

Frank was having a bad day all around, including dehydration but after a few days of TLC and some good food Frank is a new man! He is moving quite well and will be enjoying life in his new foster home now that he has been neutered and a much needed dental. Franklin is a love bug - he wants to be in a lap all the time! A more loving dog you will never want to meet! He is easy going, loves his humans and good with other dogs! Please consider this happy and healthy boy for the home he so deserves.",

Even though I am mostly blind and deaf I still enjoy short walks and an occasional trip to the dog park. I get along with all my foster brothers and sisters and I know how to get around the house and how to use the dog door to go outside. I spend most of my days sleeping and I do like to be loved on a little bit but I am not a snuggler nor do I like to hang out with my people. I prefer to be in my bed and come to my people when I feel the urge for some loving. I do love mealtime and am usually the first in line for food or a treat. My foster mom thinks I am one of the best dogs she has and she always lets me know I am loved",

For adoption information go to: www.homewardbounddogrescue.com.  You must fill out an application online as we do NOT accept applications at our clinics.\n\nHi there, my name is Red (was Nate). I am a 3-year-old male Treeing Walker Coonhound/Redbone Coonhound mix. I am a nice guy who loves his human companions. I even greet some of my most favoritest humans with a classic hound bay! I thrive on routine (walk, poop, eat), enjoy my food and do well training with treats. I love doing zoomies in the backyard, sunbathing, playing fetch with tennis balls and would never turn down a good belly rub. I would make a great running, walking or hiking buddy. I think a home on a farm somewhere could suit me really well. I need to be an only dog though. I have some resource guarding issues so no other animals and no young children for me. I know how to sit, stay, come, down, give paw and leave it. Wait until you see my happy dog smile! So what do you say? Give a great guy a chance? \n\nWe are presently not holding our regular Saturday adoption clinics due to the Covid-19 virus. We are operating on a limited basis until further notice, but we are still adopting dogs out. We require an approved application before we consider anyone for an adoption - so filling out the application is your first step. Different dogs and puppies go up for adoption EVERY WEEK so please feel free to visit the site and click on the Petfinder link for updates. Puppies and dogs up to 2 years old are $350. Dogs over 2 years old are $250. 100% of the adoption fees go to help us save more dogs.",

            "description": "This handsome gentleman is Jeremy, an 11 year old Poodle mix who weighs in at 13 pounds.  As a senior, Jeremy does have physical ailments and dementia, which require medication and special care for the remainder of his golden years.  In addition to dementia, Jeremy has low vision and chronic dry eye.  He also has problems with his back, neck and stifles (joints) that require pain medication and visits to the chiropractor once every 6-8 weeks.  For these reasons, he will need an experienced owner - one that knows how to handle his dementia and physical issues.\n\nJeremy needs to be monitored carefully so that he does not eat things that will harm him.  If given the chance, he will ingest wash cloths, rocks - really anything that isn't nailed down.  His foster mom walks him with a basket muzzle to prevent him from snatching up rocks or other objects.\n\nHe is on a special diet - Royal Canin Gastrointestinal Fiber Response - which is a prescription diet food.  Jeremy also requires eye medicine for his chronic dry eye.\n\nDue to his dementia, Jeremy is seeking a home where he is your one and only furry love - as well as a home without kids.  He'd really just love a quiet home, a caring and understanding owner, and food in his belly.  If you think you might be able to give Jeremy the pawfect loving home to spend his golden years, apply today!  \n\nHis minimum adoption fee is $185 plus a $12 fee for rabies registration for McLean County residents.\n\nHe has been neutered, microchipped, vaccinated, heartworm checked, dewormed, and is on flea and heartworm preventatives.\n\nFor information about this dog's breed(s), visit: http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/abc.htm \n\nTo fill out our adoption application, go to: http://fs16.formsite.com/WishBoneCanineRescue/adoptionapplication/index.html",

She needs a big fenced in yard  . You will need to be patient with her but once she trusts you she loves loves her belly rubs and cuddles on the couch, as well as running and playing in the yard. She loves to play ball! \n\nPepper would do better with no other dogs ,she could potentially play with other dogs ,but has trouble sharing attention ,so would be better off as the only dog in the family \n\nContact us if you are interested in meeting her, we'll talk to you about what she needs!",

George is approximately 3 years old. He is at that perfect dog age where he likes to bounce around and play, but will then lie quietly at your feet when he is done. He is housebroken and crate trained and is a very smart dog. \n\nGeorge is very affectionate and likes to lean into you for pets and will give you doggy kisses. His foster family absolutely adores him. George gets along with some dogs, but not all. He chases cats, but does not try to hurt them. He is fine with older kids, but should probably go to a home without young children. Please consider opening your heart and your home to this sweet boy...he deserves his \"happily ever after\"!\n\nYou must be over 21 and a home owner to adopt me.

            "description": "Sparky wants someone to love him. He is very skittish with new people but once he warms up to you he will be your best friend. Sparky was very neglected and abused in his past life. He was just skin and bones when we got him. He is a healthy weight now and he is doing really well at learning to trust people again. \n\nSparky is a very special dog and he requires a patient person who is willing to work with him. He is very skittish when meeting with strangers and he has his own timing to warm up to different people. His adopter needs to beware of his bite history. When he is nervous and being threatened, he may bite if you reach out to him. Of course, he doesn't do that to people he knows well. We also do not want him to go to a family with young children. \n\nIf you are reading this, we are still accepting applications on this pet. \n\nOur Adoption Process:\n\n\n\tMeet the Adoption Criteria. Before you do anything else, make sure you meet our adoption criteria. You must be at least 21 years old. You must live within a 60-mile radius of Richardson, Texas.

If you rent your home, you must provide verification that pets are allowed on the property. You must be willing to be interviewed by an adoption counselor and you must undergo an in person or virtual home visit from an RHS representative.\n\tComplete Application. https://www.richardsonhumanesociety.org/adopt/\n\tPhone Interview. Compatible applicants will be forwarded to a counselor who will contact the applicant for a phone interview.\n\tHome Visit. If all the steps above are completed satisfactorily, we will set up a visit where you can meet the pet you are interested in. We will try to include the foster parent so you can learn more about how the pet is in a home environment.\n\tComplete Adoption. If all feel it is a good match, we will schedule the adoption at your home or an off-site location. The applicant will need to complete the adoption contract and pay the adoption fee. Our adoption fee is $250 for adult dogs, $300 for puppies (under 1 year) and $125 for cats. Discounts are available for senior-aged pets.",

Abner needed clear, consistent, and meaningful information to change his behavior as well as people who understand what his behaviors meant and helped him learn better ways to show what he needs. Abner is a bit older but still acts much like a puppy. He will run and play for hours outside and then cuddle up with you on the couch later for a movie!

AN APPLICATION IS THE FIRST STEP TO ADOPTION AND WILL BE GIVEN PRIORITY.\n\nIDGSR WELCOMES NINA INTO THE SAFETY OF THE RESCUE!!!!\n\nNina is a Rottweiler/GS mix who is approx. 2 & 1/2 yr old. She is a loving and well-behaved girl. She is crate trained but doesn't need to be crated and she is housetrained too. Nina is good with other dogs. If there is another dog in the home, we prefer to do an opposite sex male dog adoption for harmony in the home. Nina's primary owner needs to be a woman. We think that Nina may have had some past abuse and it takes her a little while to get used to a man. But she warms up quickly to men if they feed her bacon and cheese!\n\nSweet good natured Nina is waiting for a family of her own to love. If you are interested in adopting Nina, please apply by\n\nCOPYING AND PASTING THE LINK BELOW FOR THE APPLICATION.\n\nhttps://www.idgsr.org/applications\n\nPlease note that submitting an application does not guarantee that you will be approved or guarantee the adoption of any specific dog, since that dog may have other applications being considered.\n\nAll our adoptable dogs are up to date on vaccinations, heartworm testing, monthly preventative, and have been spayed or neutered.\n\nEveryone must submit an application before an appointment is made to meet the dogs. Dogs are introduced to prospective adopters BY APPOINTMENT ONLY.\n\nAll dogs are fostered in TN unless stated otherwise. Transport options are available to the Northeast and Midwest.\n\n***Not able to adopt? Consider FOSTERING one of our four-legged friends https://www.idgsr.org/applications  ***\nDonations to help us care for all the dogs in our program are also greatly appreciated and may be made from our website: http://idgsr.org\n",

If you have additional questions about this dog, please call the shelter at 614-879-8368 or contact us through our website!\n\nJersey arrived on the 8th of September of 2019 after she was found out and about by a citizen. She ended up staying with us because the owner thought it would be best to find her a new loving home that can adequately care for her. Jersey is over 6 years old with an approximate birthdate of 9/8/2014, weighing about 50 pounds.  Jersey is a boss chic with a heart of gold! She's confident, out-going, and athletic. Jersey is also smart as a whip, and was a star pupil in her group obedience class. You can show her something new just a couple times and she's got it! She's affectionate and loves attention, yet she's independent enough to entertain herself, happily chewing on a big nylabone. Jersey is a middle aged gal with enough umph to join you for your morning jog, and then cuddle on the couch to binge your favorite show. She lived with a child in her first home, and the mom said Jersey loved her little girl so much she would often jump right in the bathtub with her! Jersey is not keen on the shenanigans of other dogs, and figures cats are simply not worthy. So she will truly shine as your only star. Jersey truly is a star, and needs her forever home to shine in!\n\nOur adoption fees vary, Shelter Dogs are $150, Prison Dogs are $200, Puppies are $250, and Popular Pure-Breeds are $400.

Then I'm that girl!\n\nDo you want a walking or running buddy? I could do that too.\n\nEven though I'm middle aged I'm fairly athletic, with no signs of slowing down.(Allie could easily climb a chain link type fence. She would be fine with a high privacy fence).\n\nSometimes I get a bit ornery, so my foster mom doesn't leave me loose in the house while away. I rest in my crate where she gives me treats, chew toys, a stuffed Kong and my meals. I do just fine crated overnight too.\n\nI met a cat at the veterinary hospital. Although curious about that furry creature, I must have remembered they have sharp claws so I didn't chase it.\n\nSpeaking of the vet hospital, a small mass was removed near my mammary chain that was benign. I also received a dental to clean up my choppers.\n\nFoster mom thinks I may have been a momma dog in my past life and seemed to have had plenty of human socialization. I live with several other Pointers and would do best with a male canine companion. I'd be fine as your one and only too.\n\nAllie has already been spayed, her vaccines and heartworm prevention is current.\n\nAllie's foster mom would love to talk more about her with approved applicants. \n\nWant to learn more about one of the dogs we have up for adoption? Fill out our adoption application (http://www.pointerrescue.org/adopt.html)!!\n\nTRANSPORT AVAILABLE TO APPROVED HOMES! (currently within 600 miles)\n\n",

I don't jump up on you and I mind my manners. I'll sing any tune for a loving home! I just want to bet the odds and get picked over the little puppy! So come down and we can play country and ride into the sunset!\nHere is what the crew has to say about me:Hank is a really nice dog. He always has this silly and lovable grin on his face. Pretty laid back. Very social. So come down and get this love bug today!\nPlease call Faustina at 806-664-1615 since she can give you details about the animals! If you call the Pampa animal shelter please refer to the animals by their number listed after the names. Thank you for you cooperation! 2/2/21 1:19 PM",

She has a curly q tail and is about 35 pounds of sweet snuggly Spunk. \n\nSadie has been living with three other dogs; two larger, one smaller, and goes to daycare regularly, she loves all people and dogs and is okay with cats: so long as they are the slower, and kind that do not Dart around too much, if they tend it to Dart she tends to want to Chase! \n\nSadie has been living with a trainer and knows her basic cues along with some cute fun tricks like sitting pretty, doing a dance, and some basic agility skills. \nSadie has separation anxiety that is managed with medication, and she is given either yard access or goes to daycare. If Sadie can find a home with a doggy or two sibling, and a family that can either take her to work, leaves very rarely, and where they will take advantage of the discounted boarding, training and FREE daycare offered, she'll thrive. \n\nShe can not succeed being left alone for extended times.\n\nSadie has been searching for her home for OVER A YEAR. Her current foster can't house her much longer and will offer lifetime discounted training along with lots of supplies for her to be in her forever before the end of the year. \nGive this sweetie the chance she deserves!",

But, when Princeton isn't in the mood or doesn't want others to horn in on his world, he can be a bit agressive and snarky. While he's very cute, he needs a very, very strong and consistant adopter who will not let him get away with his sometimes poor behaviors. When he's happy, he jumps, spins, rolls, and squeels to celebrate your presence. He loves walks, and even endures bath time with little objection. Because of his sometimes erratic behaviors, lhe should not. be adopted into a family with children under 14.",

She is believed to be some sort of Shepherd mix and she weighs 45 pounds.\n\nPeach is an extremely Sweet and Loving girl and she is great with kids, other dogs, and even cats but can be a little fearful with men. She rides well in the car and is a terrific dog. She is currently in a foster home with several other dogs and two cats. She is crate trained and finds comfort in her \"home\". Gentle and smart she is great in a fenced-in yard. While she gets along with others she would love all of the attention. \n\nPeach was born with a rectovaginal fistula with anal atresia. In more understandable language, she has no butthole and she poops out of her vagina. She has lived a very normal life with this condition, up until now, so we are fairly certain that she will be fine going forward. \n\nSome rescues would not even consider placing a dog like Peach. We knew what a Love she is and so now she is here and ready to find her Forever Home. If you want to be the Special Place for this very Special Girl, Peach is READY.\n\nPeach will possibly do well in a home with a doggie door and fence. Please contact us with any questions.\n\nYou can apply to adopt Peach at www.mostlymuttz.org/adoption-application/.",

He wasn\u2019t socialized at first, but is now coming along nicely.  At first, he was skittish, but then he warmed up to his foster parents after three days.  He likes being picked up by his foster mama and loved on.  He wags his tail.  Chucky plays nicely with other dogs, but he thinks the cat is a rat, because he chases it.  He will do well without cats in his forever home.  He will also need a secure fenced yard. \n Chucky is neutered and UTD on vaccines. WE DO NOT ADOPT OUT FARTHER THAN 60 MILES FROM TOLEDO.",

She's a very strong girl and she'll want to be the only dog in the household, but once she connects with you; you'll fall for her quirky, sweet personality. Her previous life was a difficult one, but her time at Satchel's has helped her decompress and know what it feels like to be loved. Riley will thrive with a dog savvy family, and will lead the way on long hikes and be your co-pilot in the car. She adores squeaky toys, tater tots and milk bone biscuits, and she'll show you her love by planting sloppy kisses on your cheek. Riley is approximately 3-4 years old and weighs about 75 pounds. If you'd like to meet her for yourself, please fill out an adoption application online (no obligation) at www.satchelslastresort.org, and an adoption counselor will contact you.",

            "description": "Budderific (Buddy) is a sweet 8 year old male Poo-chon who was surrendered to a local shelter through no fault of his own. The local shelter reached out to LWDR because Buddy couldnt stay in the shelter because of his Addisons disease. \n\nBuddy has not had accident in his foster home and appears to be potty trained. He is very food motivated and loves his treats. Buddy is super laid back and he loves to cuddle. He will need another fur sibling in his new home to play with. Buddy loves to wrestle and play with the resident dogs in his foster home. He will require a fenced yard because he loves to run and play off leash. He is very fast. He also tries to door dart.\n\nBuddys adoption fee is 250.00 He is already neutered, microchipped and is current on his vaccinations. Buddy didnt get his daily meds for his Addisons for a period of time so we are working with our vet team to gradually get him back on the correct dose where he needs to be. After his meds are at the right level he will need a dental.\n\nDogs with Addisons require an injection every 28 days and a daily oral medicine. The bottle of medicine for his shots is 200.00 and will last for several months. Buddy will also need blood checks every 14 days for awhile to ensure that he is receiving the correct dosages of his meds. Buddys new family will need to be prepared to continue his medical treatment and medicines for the rest of his life. Dogs with Addisons can live a long and happy life.\n\nUpdate: April 2 - Buddy is doing well with his current medicine dosage and schedule. He loves to go on car rides and to hang out with his family. Buddy wears a belly band since he likes to mark in his foster home. He is a happy guy that would love to find his fur ever home.\n\n\n\tWe are an all-volunteer rescue located in Omaha, Nebraska. All dogs are cared for in volunteer foster homes until they are adopted. We do not have a facility.\n\tLWDR does not ship or transport dogs.\n\tApproved out of area adoptions are considered. Adopters must be willing to travel to the Omaha area to complete adoption and take their new family member home as soon as their dog is medically and behaviorally cleared for adoption.",

I need to find a life partner while I can still shake it. I like friendly dogs,   people, and kids. I have beautiful golden eyes that will get you drunk on my love and possibly get me a few meatballs too. I haven\u2019t been exposed to felines so I don\u2019t know how I will react, just being honest. I am house broken and crate trained. My bags are packed and I am available to crash on your couch immediately. Call or text Evelyn\u2019s Place Rescue at 770-503-5402 or  678-776-6244 if you would like to meet me for a coffee (water on the rocks), lunch (good dog snacks) or for a romp at the dog park. \n",

I must be an only pet, unless you have fish, I am good with fish, pet rocks, or a chia pet. I seem to like boy dogs. I would definitely need to meet your boy dog to see if I like him. My bags are packed and I am available to crash on your couch immediately. Text Evelyn\u2019s Place Rescue at 678-776-6244 if you would like to meet me for a coffee (water on the rocks), lunch (good dog snacks) or for a walk around the block.

            "description": "Charlie is a special pup who came to us when his family simply didn't want him anymore. He is a precious boy of 8 years young, who is a little shy but extremely loyal. Charlie is loving and craves attention, and would do well with a dog or human playmate to exercise him. We believe he is a ShihTzu + Jack Russell mix! If you're interested in him, please read up on both breeds behavior and personality traits. We believe he's a good balanced mix because he's not hyper like a typical terrier, but he does point and loves to sniff and explore the yard. Charlie has some funny habits, such as being very vocal, a bit jealous, and can be timid at times. However, he is extremely well behaved, loves snuggling, potty trained, kennel trained, and only makes noise to alert you. Please fill out an application if you're interested in a sweet and funny little love bug who needs some extra love and attention. Charlie is worth all your time and love and can't wait to meet you! \nAll DFW Tzus dogs are spayed/neutered, UTD on vaccines, heart worm tested and on heart worm preventative and microchipped.\n<font color=\"purple\">Please go to our website:     www.dfwtzusandmorerescue.com   \nfor complete instructions on our adoption process and for adoption application. </font>\nCheck our website for directions/times of our next Tzu Review/Adoption event at a local Petsmart.\n<font color=\"purple\">Note: The children of adopters must be age 6 or older.</font>\n\n<bold> WE ADOPT IN THE DFW METROPLEX AREA ONLY. </bold>\n\n<font color=\"fuchsia\"><bold> <h2>WE ARE ALWAYS IN NEED OF VOLUNTEERS/FOSTER HOMES.</h2><br></bold> \n<bold>PLEASE GO TO OUR WEBSITE TO COMPLETE A VOLUNTEER/FOSTER APPLICATION\n OR TO MAKE A DONATION TO ASSIST WITH THE MEDICAL CARE OF OUR RESCUED DOGS.

            "description": "Adoption Fee:  $300\nFostered in Baton Rouge, Louisiana\nAge: 7 years\nWeight: 10.6 lbs.\n\n2/25/20 - Braxton is a bigger yorkie with a big heart.  He is a sweetie, but doesn't always have to be underfoot or right by you like most yorkies.  Don't get us wrong, he does love sleeping in bed with his humans, but will sometimes sleep at the foot of the bed and sometimes sleep by you.  He is pretty good to do his own thing.  He has a security teddy bear that he adores.  It is quite ragged now, but Braxton thinks it is made of gold and walks around the house carrying it as if it is his security blanket.  He has an awesome underbite that gives him so much character.  When Braxton first came into rescue, we could not figure out why he was adopted from the shelter several times and returned.  He is happy, glass is half full, eats good, sleeps good, does business outside each time he is brought (but could have the occassional accident), comes when called, listens and has a funny personality.  Well, Braxton is a fearful dog.  This doesn't show until you go to pick him up or if you are having to push him away from something with a hand or foot.  We cannot imagine what he has gone through in his lifetime, and his foster home is working on these things with him, but he is not a fan of being grabbed or picked up quickly.  If you do this, he will bite.  He doesn't mean to bite hard, but with his adorable massive underbite it gives quite the kick.  He would do best in a home with no other dogs or with a dog that is very submissive.  He will not compete for attention, but we find that with multiple dogs in the home, Braxton will sometimes show his alpha personality and that is one of the main reasons we have had to \"push him away\".  For instance, he is fed in a separate room since when he is done, he will literally go and steal any other dog's food.  If you were to run over and push him away because it isn't his bowl, he then snaps.  Also, being picked up.  That is better if you talk to him gently and pet him as you pick him up and we've learned that picking him up with one hand under his belly is better than grabbing him with two.  This is something that can get better with time, but someone would have to understand that it is a fear issue that seems to be embedded in him currently and would have 1) deal with it and try to limit these things he doesn't like; 2) work on it either individually or with a trainer; or 3) opt for another dog.\n\nHe is quite the cool character and is such fun if you think he is the one for you.\n\n9/12/19 - Well, they say that the 3rd time is a charm.  That\u2019s true when it comes to me.  Seems getting into Yorkie Haven Rescue is the third time that I have been adopted out of animal control.  My previous people either didn\u2019t have enough time or didn\u2019t want to put forth the effort to take care of something besides themselves, or whatever other selfish reason there could be to take something promising to love and care for it and then just discard it like a stale loaf of bread.\nOk, enough whining.  It\u2019s all good now.  I can say this, I never lost my happy personality.  As soon as I walked into my foster home, I was a happy, grateful boy.  I\u2019m very social and love all people.  I get along with other dogs my size or smaller.  By the way, I\u2019m 10.5 lbs.  Larger dogs kind of send me into overload.  I slept like a champ in the human bed at night and don\u2019t move.  I know how to enjoy comfort.  I\u2019m great with a bath and blowdry.  I\u2019m a very good eater.  A little too over-hungry at times.  I absolutely love toys and you will need a lot of them.  I will take them out of the basket, and it will look like a toy store exploded by the end of the day.  So I\u2019ll need someone who will pick them all up at the end of the night and let me start all over the next morning.\nI have this adorable underbite going on that everyone seems to think is precious.  I don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t see myself in the mirror, but I\u2019ll take their word for it.  I love giving kisses and being loved on.  I\u2019m a little nervous if you are trying to walk to me to pick me up.  I kind of remember some young children being in one of my many previous homes and they were probably a little too rough in picking me up, so you have to sometimes bend down and go slow.\nOverall all, I am a great size \u2013 not too small \u2013 not too big.  I\u2019m handsome, loving, athletic, happy and\u2026\u2026 for the LAST TIME, ready to move to my permanent home.  This rescue I\u2019m in said not to worry, they won\u2019t fail me and the next time I moved, they will find someone who wants a furry companion for life.  I have a positive outlook, so I believe them.  I\u2019ll be waiting.\n\n9/6/19 - BIO AND NEW PHOTOS COMING SOON!",

I was  extremely underweight ,un neutered. not tagged and un microchipped.. \nI am very happy that Lydia found me and Heather is also helping to take care of me because I don't know where I would be without them. I am looking for somewhere to go and for a forever home where someone will love me for the rest of my life. I am only about two years old so I have a whole life ahead of me. I've now put on weight and I am about 73 lb. I am very sweet, a good companion dog. I love to play with big dogs but don't do well with small animals. I hope to find a home with a big companion dog to play,\nIf anybody can open their heart and fall in love with me and adopt me forever.. please call Heather 954 534-5606 or email furangelsrescue@gmail.com ASAP... \n If you would like to foster me they will provide all needs and a daily fee. For adoption, an application and home visit  will be required Thank you.",

Mickey is crate trained, house trained, knows basic commands, affectionate, is amazing with every dog he meets, walks well on a leash, loves car rides, loyal, protective, and a great size at 55lbs. Well Mickey has a history as so many of us do.\n\nWith new people Mickey is like Mc Hammer, Cant Touch This. He was forced to be returned after an alleged bite to an anonymous person. After 2 weeks in bite quarantine, the poor sensitive guy was a mess. Im happy to say he has gone through months of rehabilitation and heavy socialization and is doing much better and can even attend events under the watchful eye of his foster mom. Mickey is learning to trust again.\n\nThe ideal home would be an active diligent family, a canine companion and a secure fence. With limited foot traffic of new people in and out. Mickey does warm up to new people it just takes time and patience. There is a perfect family out there for this amazing dog and they will be overjoyed to have such an amazing dog in their life.\n\nPlease apply here: https://2babrescue.com/adoption-fees-info/\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

            "description": "*This is a courtesy post for Pug Nation Rescue of Los Angeles. Bobby is not at our rescue. If you are interested in Bobby, please contact Pug Nation. Their website is https://www.pugnationla.org/home/\nBobby is a 6 and a half year old beagle/pug mix. Tricolor.\nFrom Pug Nation Rescue of LA:\n\"Bobby was in the Inland Valley Shelter when we rescued him. When he first arrived at our facility, he was quite shy and nervous about receiving attention. However, like all that have come before him, he has adjusted well and is now one of the first to greet you when you enter the pen. He's very polite about asking for love; using those sweet brown eyes to coax a scratch or two from you. Bobby was diagnosed with a condition called 'Megaesophagus'. This is a condition where the esophagus loses muscle tone and doesn't properly push food to the stomach. We feed Bobby in a chair, as it's important that he eat with his head elevated. He loves his chair and has already become a pro at sitting in it! Despite his condition, Bobby is a great boy. Although social with other dogs, oftentimes finding a friend to spoon with for an afternoon nap, there are times when he can be a bit cranky and a tiff will break out. He's also great on walks and rides in the car. We know Bobby will be the joy of any home lucky enough to snag him!\"\n\nAre you my furrever family?\n\nFor further info on the adoption process, please visit our home page and check out the \"Adopt a Dog\" section, which has thorough instructions. All our dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, and\n\nfully vaccinated before adoption; they have been wormed, bathed, socialized, walked daily and much loved; each adoptee leaves with a leash, collar, and all medical records.\n\nOur prices are higher than the shelters' because we nurse the dogs through their illnesses and get them needed surgeries and dentals. We also spend time socializing. Furthermore, unlike shelters, rescues do not get financial aid from the government and must rely on donations, grants, and adoption fees. Our fees for adults start at $150 and go up to $750. The higher end is for our most in demand dogs, such as young beagles and other purebred dogs. The lower end is for dogs who have been here a while. For puppies, we may go beyond this and charge $1000. The good news is that, because rescues fall under the \"charity\" category, the fees for our dogs are officially donations and are therefore tax deductible. You can think of it as donating to a worthy cause and getting a dog in return!\n\nSponsor Me\n\nBeagles & Buddies must find ways to raise money so we can continue saving dogs. Your tax-deductible donation keeps our rescue kennel operating!\n\nHours\n\nFriday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSaturday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nSunday: 10 am to 3 pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED\n\nTuesday: CLOSED\n\nWednesday: CLOSED\n\nThursday: CLOSED\n\n\n\nWeekday appointments may be available. We are a small staff and do our best to accommodate your needs. **Note that during COVID, we are not holding open houses on any day. Please email us for an appointment and include your application (found on our website, beaglesandbuddies.com, under \"Forms\"). Most appointments will be Friday through Sunday, though other days may also be available. We usually schedule one appointment per hour. Allow 1-2 hours for your appointment. Please look at our website and make a list of one or more dogs that you would like to see.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf you have a question about adopting, giving up a dog, boarding, or volunteering, please visit the appropriate tabs on our\nhome page.\n\nFor more specific questions, call 626-444-9664 (please leave a voicemail if no answer) or email at beaglesandbuddies@gmail.com. Note that\nEmailing\nis always preferred!\n\nThanks!\n\nPlease note: If you are viewing this profile anywhere other than Beagles & Buddies own website, you are not receiving full info.

She let me pick her skinny little 35 lbs body up and put her in my jeep.\n\nI took her to the vet today. She does not have a chip, which I'm not surprised. She is heartworm negative, which I am pleasantly surprised?. She will be spayed in 3 weeks. She is up to date on shots now, including rabies. She is SUPER SWEET.\n\nIf you would like to be considered for adoption, please complete the adoption questionnaire on our website www.heartsofgoldpitrescue.com.  \n\n*1-2 years old\n*Crate trained\n*House trained\n*Needs to be an ONLY dog",

Swimming in the pool is his favorite summer time activity and in winter he loves romping through the snow. \nHe has done well with dogs the same size or bigger than him at Dogtown, though he takes a bit to warm up to new dogs. He does require someone with dog experience because he can guard his food and toys at times. He would love to meet any potential new dog housemates at the Sanctuary.",

            "description": "Hiyee! I\u2019m Zoey! Are you looking for a great shepherd mix to add to your home? If so, you are in luck! I happen to be looking for my forever person or family!\n\nI am about two years old, and I am a very athletic gal who loves to run and play. I\u2019m really fast, too! In addition to being athletic, some of the people who know me have told me that I\u2019m gorgeous. I don\u2019t really know if I am because we dogs, well, we\u2019re not really concerned about our appearances! I mean, we roll in stuff in the yard after all! But I think maybe it\u2019s a good thing people think I\u2019m gorgeous because it may help me get adopted.\n\nI can vouch for some other things on my own, though\u2014like the fact that I\u2019m a very sweet and loving girl. I love to receive some neck scratches. (And some good butt scratches, too, if you don\u2019t mind!) And I can be silly\u2014I\u2019m still a young pup after all! I like to make people laugh.\n\nI love to learn new things, too, and my friends have said that I\u2019m smart! I have a beautiful \u201csit\u201d and a great \u201crecall\u201d that I can show off to you. And I\u2019d love to learn more things. I\u2019m also working on my young girl manners to not jump up on my human friends when I get excited. I just want to show you I love you, but I\u2019m told it\u2019s best to communicate that in other ways! \n\nI love rolling in the grass, playing with toys, getting affection, learning new things; but truthfully, one of my most favorite things to do is play ball. I like playing with other toys, too, but chasing a ball is the most fun! Because it involves running! Although in the effort of full disclosure, I\u2019m not so great about catching the ball when it is tossed up in the air! Maybe we can work on that! And ok, more full disclosure; sometimes, when we\u2019re playing fetch, I will run after the ball, but then not bring it back because I think it\u2019s funny to make my human friends go get it. I mean, I think you should mix it up sometimes when you\u2019re playing games! That way no one gets bored! \n\nI really adore my humans, and I have lived with other dogs, too. Although a yard to run and play in would be great for me, a privacy fence is best\u2014I can jump over a 4-foot-fence! I\u2019m an athletic gal after all! \n\nOh, I hope after reading this you will want to learn more about me! Or better yet--that you'll want to come meet me! \n\n*Zoey is currently staying in the Kansas City metro, but transport is available to her forever home.

Harold loves to relax and nap snuggled up with his people. \n\nSPECIAL NEEDS to adopt Harold. He has been diagnosed by OSU with an auto immune disorder and will need lifelong medications as well as regular (likely every 3-6 months) vet appointments for the forseeable future to make sure his medications are at the right level. They will need to gradually increase as he grows and ages. Anyone adopting will need to be aware of his past medical history and be willing and able to monitor his health and provide the needed treatments. He will also probably need an experienced owner. Due to his medical history he hasn't been very well socialized outside of the home so can be guardy of his people. He does great in the home according to the foster and she is continuing to work on his socialization.",

My name is Shelley, and I am a lovely lady who would love to spend my life by your side as your smiley best furry friend. I am a pittie mix, estimated to be about 12 years old and just under 50 pounds, who is available for adoption through Fetching Tails Foundation. I am an affectionate girl, and my huge smile is contagious. I get along with people of all ages and the kiddos in my foster home are my best friends, for sure! Don't let my age fool you: I still enjoy being active and love a game of fetch or playing with toys. I also enjoy sunbathing in the grass and napping near you. I would be happiest as your one and only furry friend; I previously lived with other dogs and am ok around very calm dogs who will give me space to nap, but I also really like your attention focused on me!\n\nMy ideal home would include someone who is home more often than not since I like to be around my people so much. I am potty trained, but need to do my business frequently as I was diagnosed with early-stage kidney disease so I have to pee-pee often; I am on a prescription diet that I will need to be on the rest of my life. I prefer not to be crated and will rest in my dog bed if you have to leave the house to run errands. More than anything, I just want someone to love me and give me a comfy, happy home for my senior years! If you think I could be the devoted girl for you, please fill out an adoption application soon so we can get our happily ever after started!\n\nLove,\nShelley\n\nADOPTION REQUIREMENTS, NO EXCEPTIONS: \n*ADOPTION FEE: WAIVED\n*Be at least 21 years of age \n*Live in a 50-mile radius of Itasca, within the Illinois border\n*Have the knowledge and agreement of all adults living in the household \n*Have approval from owner of residence (written in lease) \n*Have a valid ID with current address (please provide proof of address if ID address is not up-to-date)\n*Be approved as a suitable adoptive home by Fetching Tails Foundation \n*Be prepared to make a lifetime commitment\n\nIf interested please fill out an application on our website at www.fetchingtailsfoundation.org; please make sure you fill in every required field/question or your submission will not go through. Please note that we take time to learn as much as we can about each dog in our care and our bios are our current observations; we are unable to make any guarantees on the future health or temperament of your adopted dog. Most dogs in our care come with unknown pre-rescue history and as such breed and age estimates are an educated guess. If any questions please email us!",

            "description": "Moberly is a super affectionate, lovable guy, just waiting for the right person or family to adopt him. \n\nThis handsome black and tan German Shepherd (possible a mix), is about two years old and weighs around 60 lbs.  We at the rescue cannot believe he hasn\u2019t been adopted yet - he is such a lover!\n\nMoberly's foster had a family emergency and Moberly has been boarded at a facility since then. We desperately want to get him back with a family\u2014either foster or forever.\n\nMoberly has had manners training. He has gone from jumpy & exuberant to mannerly and attentive. He has good energy inside the house, happy to lay around with a good chew, or rest at your feet provided he has had sufficient activity. \n\nHe is smart-as-a-whip, learns quickly, and would do well to have mentally stimulating activities, like nose work, treat dispensing toys, or puzzle toys.  This dog would love to go to positive reinforcement \u201cschool\u201d and would surely be the top of his class.\n\nStill a youngster, Moberly requires exercise but would do better with frequent shorter walks due to some dysplasia of his left hind leg.  A good-sized fenced yard is a must.\n\nHe absolutely adores people and would love a home where someone is there much of the time. If there are children, they should be 12 years old or over. He would be great for a person or family who has experience with German Shepherds and understands their personality.\n\nMoberly has done well being introduced and playing with female dogs off leash.\n\nIf you can foster Moberly or are interested in adopting him, please complete an application at the following link:\n\nhttps://forms.gle/6pfDGnDPpJ6LkReZA\n\nQuestions or interested in fostering? Contact us at connellpetrescue@gmail.com \n\nThe adoption fee covers the cost of his neuter, up-to-date vaccines, up-to-date rabies vaccine, any vet visits before adoption, and his microchip.\n\nThank you!\nAnd Moberly thanks you too!\n",

She did well with all situations trainer put her through, including a couple of meet and greets with other dogs (both male and female - her breed). She loves her humans and would do excellent as the only fur baby. She enjoys hiking when given the opportunity, just laying around and watching tv, eating snacks (especially if they're yours), and most loves to just spend time with her human. She deserves so much more and I hope you would consider giving her a furever home with lots of love and patience.",

He is a very sweet, loving boy and he does great with other dogs. He is curious about cats. \nHis lists of loves include: people, attention, playing outside in the yard, and going on car rides. He's very active and needs lots of exercise and a secure yard. He's just looking for someone to give him all the love. \n\n\n*Take Paws Rescue saves dogs from high-kill shelters in Southeast Louisiana, owner surrenders, and discarded dogs with uncertain futures. All of our dogs are healthy, spayed/neutered, vaccinated and on heartworm preventative. They live in foster homes where they are socialized, and well cared for. Many have basic obedience skills and all have been temperament tested. An application will be required to make sure it\u2019s the perfect match!\n\nIf you are interested in meeting and/or adopting, please visit our website to complete an application: http://www.takepawsrescue.org/adoption-form\n(please note: app cannot be done on a mobile device)\n\nIf you have any questions, please email us at adopt@takepawsrescue.org",

            "description": "Meet gorgeous Aubrey!  Aubrey is a special girl in need of a unique adopter situation. Here are some of her delightful attributes: (1) She is sensitive and eager to please; (2) she enjoys chewing on sturdy chew toys; and (3) she shows her person deep empathy. (For example, one time her foster Mommy was crying, and Aubrey licked the tears from her foster Mommy\u2019s face, while reaching a paw out to comfort her.) Especially on Aubrey\u2019s chest and face, her fur feels like soft velvet. She weighs around 52 pounds, and her age is an estimated four to six years old.\n\nAdditionally, Aubrey is able to connect deeply with people. She is shy, but once her trust has been earned, she enjoys soft belly rubs and lying close, sometimes while smushing her cheek against yours, and, if you\u2019re lucky, flopping one ear over your face (a funny and heartwarming experience). She is truly a love and will make an amazing best friend for a lucky person.\n\nAubrey\u2019s trainer and foster Mommy believe that a home meeting the following criteria would be best for Aubrey\u2019s needs:\n\n1. An adult-only home.\n2. Gentle, rewards-based training only.\n3. No other pets.\n4. A rural type of setting (Aubrey\u2019s trainer believes Aubrey would do best with ample space \u2013 i.e., no apartments, condos or tiny backyards).\n5. A highly experienced dog person, with advanced skills in (A) interacting with under-socialized dogs and (B) interpreting dog body language.\n6. Someone willing to walk Aubrey only with Aubrey wearing a muzzle. To clarify, Aubrey has never exhibited any threatening signs with people, but she is unlikely to do well if an off-leash animal approached.\n7. A moderately active person willing to walk Aubrey and spend time with her. Aubrey is exceptionally smart and will thrive only with mental and physical activity, plus nurturing companionship.\n8. Someone reasonably strong and sturdy, because Aubrey can pull hard sometimes when she sees another animal while out on a walk.\n9. Someone who is kind to her and never hits or yells at her. Aubrey is a sensitive sweetheart, who deserves someone loving, kind, gentle and patient.\n\nWe are looking for a forever home for Aubrey in California.",

She is currently fostered with our dog (3 years old) but would do best as a solo dog in the house as she loves to be the centre of attention. She would do best with an athletic owner as she does not run out of energy. \n\nSince TAGS is a smaller volunteer program, we are limited to facilitating adoptions only within Durham Region in Ontario.

SO BEFORE YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH THIS BEAUTIFUL DOG, PLEASE READ ON...\n\nAt 2 years old and weighing around 53 lbs,, Cookies has unbridled excitement at getting out of the cage -- with people that she knows and trusts. Having been at the shelter a full year, Cookies has developed an aversion to strangers making it difficult to introduce her to potential adopters. Yet with only a couple of visits (and some tasty treats), Cookies has made many friends of the volunteers and even goes home for lengthy sleepovers with two of them. There has been much interest in this beautiful dog who is especially smart, walks well on leash and is adept at executing many commands. During her overnight stays she has proved to be housebroken, calm during the day after a long morning walk and delightful company. When walking on the Panhandle trail, she pays little attention to other people or even dogs, thanks to the volunteers managing her by refocusing her attention. She is often wildly reactive at the shelter when nearing new people or other dogs, but is slowly, continuously improving. She knows many commands and walks well on leash. \n\nWHOEVER IS INTERESTED IN MEETING COOKIES WILL NEED TO INVEST TIME IN SEVERAL VISITS TO EARN HER TRUST. But once you are in the Cookies-club, you are IN forever. \n\nAs with many border collies, Cookies is looking for a job to do and she isn't getting what she needs stuck in a cage at the shelter. Cookies needs an ADULT ONLY HOME without other pets. Loyal, intelligent and fun, Cookies is plenty of dog for any experienced dog person.\n\nFOSTER \"MOM\" CHRISTINA WILL SPEAK TO ANY SERIOUSLY INTERESTED POTENTIAL ADOPTER. PLEASE CONTACT HER WITH COOKIES IN THE SUBJECT LINE AT: christina.gillespie10@gmail.com\n\nApproved applicants receive priority.\nClick on the \"More About Us\" link to get to our \"Adoption Application\" link.\n\nEmail completed applications to: sandraschiller3008@gmail.com",

Luckily for us, we were rescued before anything really bad could happen - sometimes puppies like us are shot for being in the wrong place. Our rescuers took such good care of us, and then sent us to Fast Friends to find our forever homes.\n\nAll these changes have have made me a little wary of new people and situations. I'm a playful, happy puppy once I'm comfortable, and all my friends think my antics are so silly. I love to play with my siblings, but I can have fun everywhere. Even a leaf can keep me entertained!\n\nChange can be scary, but I'm ready to find my home with a family who will gently show me love and help me learn to trust.\n\n* Fast Friends adopts in the New England area. If you are interested in Angus or one of our other available dogs, please complete an adoption application at www.helpinggreyhounds.org/adopt-a-greyhound. \n\n** Angus is extremely timid and needs a very special home with an experienced owner who can be with him most of the time. He needs a quiet environment \u2013 Angus would NOT do well in a city or on a busy street \u2013 with one of his siblings or another confident dog. Angus' adopter must have a securely fenced yard.",

            "description": "HI, I'm Astrix!\n\nI'm a very special puppy, looking for a very special home.\n\nI'm a wadi dog, from the country of Oman. I used to live on the street, but I was lucky enough to be rescued along with my six siblings and our mum. \"Street dogs\" like us aren't very desirable as pets in Oman, so the nice people that rescued us arrange for me and five of my brothers and sisters to come to Fast Friends to find our forever homes.\n\nLiving on the street was hard, and even though I spent months safe with my rescuers in Oman and now at Fast Friends, I am still wary of new people and situations. I love to play with my siblings, but I get scared when the big dogs bark at me. \n\nWhat I would like most is to find a quiet home with a family who will go slow and let me gradually build up my trust. It would be great if they could come and visit me a few times before taking me home, so the change wouldn't be so scary! A big brother or sister would be great, too, to show me how everything works.\n\nI promise once I settle in, I will give you unending love!\n\n* Fast Friends adopts in the New England area. If you are interested in Astrix or one of our other available dogs, please complete an adoption application at www.helpinggreyhounds.org/adopt-a-greyhound. \n\n** Astrix is extremely timid and needs a very special home with an experienced owner who can be with her most of the time. She needs a quiet environment \u2013 Astrix would NOT do well in a city or on a busy street \u2013 with one of her siblings or another confident dog. Astrix' adopter must have a securely fenced yard.",

We are really lucky dogs, and whoever adopts us will be lucky, too!\n\nI'm a wadi dog, descended from salukis, as you may be able to see from my lovely long legs and slim build. We are very rare outside of our home region; you have probably never seen a puppy quite like me before! Along with out exotic good looks, wadi dogs are known for our smarts and loyalty.\n\nI just know that I am going to be a fantastic companion for someone, and I hope that day comes soon! I am shy around new people and situations, so my new family will need to take it slow and give me plenty of time to settle in. But once I trust you and feel safe, you'll see you've really hit the jackpot with a wadi dog by your side!\n\n* Fast Friends adopts in the New England area.

My siblings and I were living with our mom on a college campus, which was not a safe place for us, as stray dogs can be shot in Oman.\n\nI'm a very sensitive soul, and new things are scary for me. I always feel better when one of my siblings is around. I feel safe with my human friends, too. They give me lots of cuddles and now that I know them better, I really like our time together a lot. \n\nWhat I would like most is a home of my own, with a family who understands I need space and time to get comfortable.\n\n* Fast Friends adopts in the New England area. If you are interested in Atlas or one of our other available dogs, please complete an adoption application at www.helpinggreyhounds.org/adopt-a-greyhound. \n\n** Atlas is extremely timid and needs a very special home with an experienced owner who can be with her most of the time. She needs a quiet environment \u2013 Atlas would NOT do well in a city or on a busy street \u2013 with one of her siblings or another confident dog. Atlas' adopter must have a securely fenced yard.",

Due to this Rose has a head tilt and used to be really off balance and circle all the time. In the year that she\u2019s been with us, her balance and circling have greatly improved. She does still bob her head when she walks and at times will spin circles when she gets excited. Rose does great with other dogs, she\u2019s house broke And kennel trained and good with kids. She would do best in a home without cats! This amazing girl would love nothing more then to found a home of her own.\n\n**Due to Covid-19 we are unable to do any adoptions outside a 30 mile radius of Jefferson City, MO at this time.**",

Please see the contact information at the end of her biography.\n\nOur sweet Cosette is still looking for her forever family and her foster mom can\u2019t figure out why! Cosette is a 12 pound, six-year-old, spayed female Chihuahua who came into the shelter as a very scared little girl. Now in a foster home, she gives great kisses and will snuggle under the covers if you let her.\n\nShe is good with cats, dogs, even pigs and chickens, she loves kids, she rides wonderfully in the car, she is crate trained and potty trained! Cosette is a sassy little girl that will roll on the ground to scratch her back any chance she gets! She walks like a show pony and loves snuggling in your lap to watch a movie. She is perfect. She deserves the perfect family; could that be you? She will bring so much love and loyalty into the life of whoever adopts her.\n\nPotential adopters need to know that Cosette is being seen at the Eye Clinic for Animals twice a year and is on two kinds of daily eye drops which will be a yearly expense of about $585.\n\nTo meet Cosette or learn more about her, email fciaadoptions@aol.com or call 619-466-9137.\n",

At a whole 30 pounds, her zoomies will make you laugh, her sweetness will make you never want to stop snuggling, and her good manners will make you never want to give her up!\n\nSugar Baby is so sweet, loves to give kisses and hugs, and is very attentive to her people. She loves to just be where you are and she has shown nothing but gratitude and love for her humans. \n\nShe walks excellently and would be a great hiking or running companion for someone. Shes the perfect mix of energy and couch potato. After she does her zoomies and gets in a nice walk, you can find Sugar Baby passed out on the couch enjoying a nice nap, definitely snoring. \n\nTheres a common misconception with white dogs and light colored eyes that they are deaf. Sugar Baby IS NOT DEAF! She listens very well to her people and is eager to please. She takes redirection and training very well. We would love to see her go to a home where she could continue to work on her skills. \n\nAlthough she has lived with other dogs in the past, Sugar Baby would do best as an only pet & in a home with kids over 10 due to her strength & playfulness. She can jump a 5ft fence with no problem so adoptive home needs to have a higher fence or no fence at all. Being left unsupervised is not a good idea!\n\nSugar Baby has been with us for a few months and we dont understand why! Come get your sweet-tooth filled with our Sugar Baby by completing an application!\n\n*Homeownership required!\n\nAdoption fee includes the following:\n\n\n\tSpay/Neuter\n\tRabies Vaccination\n\tDistemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies)\n\tBordetella\n\tMicrochip with prepaid lifetime registration\n\tDeworming",

            "description": "05/02/2020- FORREST is an energetic dog who has spent the last several months in foster with one of our amazing trainers working on his impulse control. He is a young dog who needs a tremendous amount of exercise and structure to thrive. He would make an excellent running partner! FORREST does well with dogs that he cannot push around. He enjoys playing with dogs his size and bigger, but absolutely needs a dog who is not submissive. FORREST is not a candidate for a home with young children per our trainer. He is an awesome dog who enjoys belly rubs and will give you kisses for days. He loves to play fetch and knows all the basic commands.\n\n Forest was picked up as a stray on Parkway Avenue in Ewing. He was brought in by Animal Control. Forest is a very sweet and friendly young dog.Adoption by appointment only with an approved adoption application.Please go to www.easelnj.org/adopt to submit an adoption application.

When it's time to exercise, playing ball is the activity of choice in a fenced yard, the higher the better. She'd like to take walks on leash, but doesn't mind staying close to home. Sniffing to discover new smells rather than long walks is just fine with her. She would rather be with you than in large crowds as she is cautious with strangers, but once she gets to know them in familiar surroundings, she is ready for belly rubs. She has played with the fosters larger dogs but prefers to be the only dog in your family. The fosters grandchildren have played ball with her and she likes how they tell her to sit first then to retrieve. Rules and boundaries help her to feel comfortable. She has been waiting for awhile in rescue but only because she is waiting for the right family. If you think you are the right one for her please fill out an application.\n\n\nCheck out my featured adoption video here. It's really good, isn't it?

Her beautiful solid cream coat requires only occasional brushing and grooming.  Mimi came to us from The Anti-Cruelty Society on 08/19/2019.  Their medical staff deemed her unadoptable due to a confluence of medical issues and recommended she be turned over to a rescue group.  They reached out to several Chihuahua specific and mixed breed organizations but no one wanted her.  We care about little loving pets and even though Mimi isn\u2019t a Shih Tzu we agreed to give her a chance.   Mimi is housetrained but will need help adjusting to your household and schedule.  A spirited bundle of love and kisses; shy at first but when she warms up she is fun loving and playful.  Quiet (not the least bit barky as some Chihuahuas can be!!).  Well-mannered and self-reliant, she will entertain herself and can be trusted to behave when home alone. One look into those big brown trusting eyes with just a hint of mischief hidden in them and your heart will melt.  Mimi gets alone just fine with all the small dogs here at the Safehouse.  Her experience with cats is unknown.  Much too tiny and delicate for a home with children, Mimi is nicely suited to singles and seniors; she fits easily on a lap.  A nice match for apartment dwellers because she tires out rather easily with indoor playtimes and walks.  Mimi requires extensive reconstructive surgery to her left rear leg but, due to her severe heart murmur (Grade 5/6) she must first be evaluated by a veterinary cardiologist to determine her surgical risk.  Unfortunately the Safehouse does not have the resources available to implement these recommended medical procedures at this time.  Mimi is being given the best medical care possible, the attention of a dedicated caretaker and the comfort and care she needs and deserves to live as full a life as possible in a loving environment.  Mimi is spayed, microchipped, current on all vaccines, heartworm and flea/tick preventative; she has had a complete physical.  Her adoption fee is $300.",

He was a little unsure at first, but he's doing remarkably well now that he's in a safe environment.  He's a very loving little dog and warms up to you very quickly.  He chases cats, so he needs to be in a cat-free home.  He loves to play fetch and likes to be in your lap as much as possible.  Oscar is really an endearing little fella.  Oscar is Jasper's father, and since they have been together since Jasper was born, they will only be adopted as a bonded pair.  \n\nA fenced-in yard is required.  \n\nPlease go to our website at www.dachshundrescueofohio.org to fill out an application.  The application can now be completed online through the site and is automatically emailed to us.\n",

He can be a bit pushy in his communication with humans, but only when that behavior works! Strong leadership with consistent instruction will be necessary for Clifford to settle in with his new family and find his place in his \"\"pack\"\". With instruction and clearly set boundaries, Clifford will thrive in his new home! Check in with a member of our staff for more information about Clifford and his training needs and whether he'd be a good fit for your household.For additional information regarding this pet please contact Utah Animal Adoption Center at (801) 355-PETS (7387).\n\nOur shelter is located at 1955 N. Redwood Road in Salt Lake City. \n\nOpen hours to the public are Tuesday - Saturday, 11 AM - 6 PM. Please note that we stop showing animals at 5 PM.",

            "description": "Well hi there! I'm Gypsy the Princess. That's what my foster momma calls me because I always find the most comfortable places to sleep. Blankets, piles of clothes, stuffed animals, couch bed or chair, it doesn't matter; I'm not picky! One thing I'm not crazy about is my crate but I am working on it. I just need someone to help me see that it is a safe place to hang out. \n \nGoing for walks is pretty fun! Everyone I meet tells me how pretty I am! There is this thing called a \"\"cat\"\" in my foster home and he doesn't seem to like me very well. He runs away from me and I think it's a game so I chase him! Not sure what I would do if I caught him though. My foster momma has learned that I would do best in a home without other dogs. I just don't seem to appreciate their company. I would love all the attention to be on me anyway! \n\nGetting some snuggles from my humans is one of my favorite things! I love to sit by them on the couch and soak up all the attention. I share my home with a human boy and I really enjoy being near him. We have fun together! My foster mom says I am a very easy going, relaxed lady. I kinda just go with the flow and take it all in. I really love to please my people so I try very hard to always be well behaved. \n\nI can't wait to meet my new family. Hopefully they have a comfy couch for me to curl up on! \n\nREQUIRED TRAINING:\nGypsy's adopter will be required to purchase training sessions and work closely with our trainers so that Gypsy and her family will have the tools they need to help her with challenges she faces. All of the training information will be given to the adopter during the adoption process. \n\n------------------------------------------\n\n\nAll our Warrior Dogs will have all age appropriate medical care and vaccines, a microchip, and spay/neuter before adoption unless age is a factor with a puppy younger than 6-12 months at the time of adoption. If that is the case, the spay/neuter will be covered in the adoption fee and the owner will be responsible to have the procedure completed at a Warrior Dog Rescue Veterinarian at the appropriate time.\n\nPlease note that the majority of our dogs in rescue are from shelters where they have been found as strays or abandoned. Their breed description is based on our very best educated guess based on physical characteristics and their dispositions. If they came to our rescue as an owner surrender, the breed description will be listed as provided by the previous owner.\n\nAdoption Fee - $350.00\nTraining Discount - $50\nAdoption Fee after Training - $300\n\nTo apply for this pup, please submit an Adoption Application at http://warriordogrescue.com/adopt/adoption-application/",

My Adoption fee is only $50.00 to a suitable family, background screening will be done to make sure I go to an honest, safe home!\n\nLet me tell you, I am quite a diva! Although, I'm over 8 y/o and have had a tough life, I am still a confident, playful girl, who also loves cozy nights on the couch cuddling with my foster family. They say I am a great dog and I love to cuddle. You do need to give me a lil time to warm up to you and get to know my personality. I am a quirky, but adorable girl. I still have a ton of spunk in me!\n\nI do well in my fenced yard foster home, which is great bc there are not any other dogs bordering the yards. I can get feisty with other dogs, so please, I need a pet free home. I do need a fenced yard. If the fence is see through, and there are other animals on the other side, I will not do well with them. So, privacy, or no other animals bordering is ideal. That is what I have in my current foster home and I do so well there. I LOVE playing in my backyard!! I LOVE sprinklers and playing in the kiddie pool, splashing in the water, jumping into raked leaves, and romping through the snow. I am a such a happy, free-spirit!\n\nI adore my humans! Being an older gal, I am a little hard of hearing, but not too bad. I may have a little cataracts, but all pretty expected with age. For that reason, I can startle easily sometimes, so it's best that there be no children in my home. I'm a loving girl, but can be a lil snappy at times if I'm made to feel uncomfortable. My foster family have no issues with me, bc they did an amazing job going slow with me in the beginning. I am joined at their hip now! I trust them and love laying on them, sometimes I think I'm a lap dog! I get to sleep in their bed and love snuggling in the blankets! My foster family are such gentle, easy going human beings. They never make me feel uncomfortable, so we are having a great time together! \n\nI am looking for a perfect furever home where I can live out my golden years in peace, love, and comfort! Once again, I am still quite an active girl, and you'd never know I am 8.5 y/o, though. I have been through some stuff in life. I'm Almost Home's longest resident (4.5 years in the rescue, and have had 3 foster homes in that time).\n\nAll dogs matter, even older gals like me! A senior dog will bless you in so many special ways. Won't you open your heart to me and give me a chance? I will keep you entertained all year long!\n\nIf you feel a connection with me and want to give me my furever home, please complete an online application at: https://us01.sheltermanager.com/service?account=ah0334&method=online_form_html&formid=5\n\nLocated near West Bloomfield, Michigan!\nWww.almosthomeanimals.orgTo complete an adoption application, go to: http://almosthomeanimals.org/applications/adoption/",

He was found roaming the streets of the Red Lands where he followed people walking to their cars and would try to jump in for safety. Sampson walks great on a leash and listens to commands as he knows sit, wait, and even roll over. Sampson needs time to warm up to people, and is people selective, but once he trusts you, he is wonderful companion. Sampson loves to play with squeaky toys and will toss a ball back to you. He would do best in a home by himself. We ask that anyone interested in Sampson, come and spend time with him to gain his trust. To meet Sampson, please fill out an application at www.abandonedpetrescue.orgTo meet this adoptable pet, please fill out an adoption application at www.abandonedpetrescue.org and a team member will contact you to schedule an appointment.",

One of the volunteers stopped us while we were on a live video and getting ready to leave. She mentioned they had a dog there who was on the euth list and really needed out. We were told he had come in with his dog friend but he had been adopted. When we go to shelters we don't just choose the most adoptable little guys. Those will make it out. We get the guys who need a little extra help. Luckily at the ranch we have the resources to be able to help dogs like Vinny. He's working through some anxiety and uncertainty around other dogs. He's already made best bud with another adoptable dog we have named Doug and they're doing great together. Vinny comes with a free training session with Angela before he's adopted. We can not wait to see a happy ending for Vinny. He's such a sweet deserving little man.\n\nhttps://www.marleysmutts.org/vinny-2/ If you are interested in adopting a Marley's Mutts please fill out an application at http://marleysmutts.org/adoptionprocess/",

I am a little shy and timid to start but warm up quickly and love all people. Walks aren't really my thing, but snacks and bad reality TV are. I am extremely low maintenance, 100% housebroken and have the most gentle disposition. I am disinterested in other animals when on a walk but prefer to be the only animal in the home (mostly because I don't agree with ARNO's assessment that I am, in fact, a dog). I would rather not be inside when there is a loud and crowded party. I'll be chilling out back until things die down. I need a nice yard with some shade to chill when it's nice out, a spot on the sofa to watch my pictures, and a few walks a week to get some sniffs in. I tried to swim once and sunk like a bag of rocks, so I'll never try that again! If you're a couch potato like me and need a best friend who thinks the world of you, then I'm your guy. Have you seen my adorable face? I love posing for pics. Let's take a selfie together!\n\nMy adoption fee is $200. This includes a spay/neuter, up-to-date vaccines, deworming, a microchip, a heartworm test, and, if needed, heartworm treatment.\n\n________________________________________________\n\nFor all animals that have not been spayed or neutered a $100 deposit will be required in addition to the adoption fee.

            "description": "Hello!\n\nI am Eli. I am a senior chihuahua and pit bull terrier mix. I need your help: I am a bit shy with people, but if you have the patience, I warm up and become one of the quirkiest and funniest dogs you've ever met. I even like other dogs if you already have any in your home with you! I just don't prefer cats or children since I get nervous. I really, really need my own pack of people and/or people and dogs to make me feel safe and happy. I have been at ARNO for almost eight years. They are wonderful people who I have gotten to know so well. I love them so much that when they teach me a new trick, I want to impress them so I learn fast especially to get treats! Walking and running on leash are my specialty and so is basking in the sun! I just need an adult-only home, and someone who is experienced, patient and willing to help me build up my confidence so I'm a little less unsure about the world around me. I feel so much better when people understand me and see I am a loyal and laid back guy with a safe environment you've provided for me.\n\nMy adoption fee is $200. This includes a spay/neuter, up-to-date vaccines, deworming, a microchip, a heartworm test, and, if needed, heartworm treatment.\n\n________________________________________________\n\nFor all animals that have not been spayed or neutered a $100 deposit will be required in addition to the adoption fee. The deposit is refundable upon completion of the spay / neuter surgery.\n\nFor more information email: adopt@animalrescueneworleans.org.\n\nTo complete an application, please visit: https://animalrescueneworleans.org/adoptfoster/.\n\nPlease visit our facebook for more information about adoption specials, and adoption events. Events are a great way to meet multiple animals at a time!",

I'm pretty chill, and I mostly enjoy eating and sleeping on my dog bed. I love being pet and scratched. I prefer my own space to lots of cuddle time and chaos, so I'd do best in a home without kids or rambunctious dogs. I have a heart murmur that's being managed well by meds. Despite that, I'm a little bit sassy--what can I say, I'm a Chihuahua after all! But If you're looking for a canine kiddo who doesn't need much besides meals and potty time, I'm your girl! \n\nAll CAWS animals are fixed, microchipped, and vaccinated. Her adoption fee is $100.

Did I mention I am a hunter of birds and rodents?\nI love hanging out with my people and I think I should get to go everywhere with them. I am cool\nhanging out in my crate with something to do if I absolutely can't go with my people. I will sleep\nin my crate if I must, but I would prefer to sleep right next to my human. Oh, my favorite job is\nprotecting house. My foster mom says I am like a gargoyle that way. I need to meet new people\non leash with a muzzle until I figure out strangers are not all bad, which may take some time. I\nmay need to meet the same person multiple times that way. I need to be on leash in the front\nyard as well because of my protective tendencies. I am house broken and love the doggie door.\nI don't like loud noises and I need to be crated when you vacuum or mow the lawn. I hate the\nnoise those devices make so much I try to kill the evil creature making it. I am good with small\ndogs, but not dogs bigger than me. I like my voice, so shared walls are probably not going to be\nfor me. My ideal home would be someone familiar with strong-willed, stubborn terriers, and\nwilling to be the alpha. Kids are probably not a good idea unless they are older and are familiar\nwith how to handle me. My new family must be someone committed to me for the long haul,\nwilling to mitigate my territorial tendencies, and challenge me mentally and keep me active. If\nthat sounds like you fill out an application and have a chat with my foster mom.\n\nDogs are not placed on a first-come, first-served basis. We strive to find the perfect home for each animal. Applications may take up to 48 hours to process. \n\nAll CAWS animals are fixed, microchipped, and vaccinated. Scooter's adoption fee is $200.

We pulled him from there and now he needs a forever home. Tootsie has a lot of energy and will need plenty of exercise. He would be perfect in a home with someone who has experience with pit bulls and especially if that person likes to run because Tootsie would be the perfect running partner! Tootsie is for adults only and should be an only dog.\n\nIn light of current events, adoptions are available by appointment only. An adoption application can be submitted online for any desired pet by going to http://www.aafpets.org/adopt-a-pet/. If the app is approved, we will contact you to set up an appointment!Thank you for considering adopting a pet from the Animal Adoption Foundation.\nAll AAF cats and dogs are vaccinated, spayed or neutered and microchipped. All cats receive a FelV/FIV combination test while dogs over the age of 8 months are tested for heartworms. All pets are also treated for both intestinal parasites and fleas. The AAF is proud of the medical attention that is given to each and every pet as their health and well-being is of the utmost importance to our organization. \nThe adoption fee for our pets is as follows:\nKittens: $85\nCats 5 Months and older: $60\nPuppies: $150\nDogs 5 Months and older: $135\nYou can visit this and all of our pets available for adoption:\nTuesday-Friday 4 PM - 7 PM\t\nSaturday and Sunday 1 PM- 4 PM",

While in the home, she became very attached to the children and would not leave their side. She was accustomed to being groomed and having her nails trimmed. She loves to be wherever the people are and would prefer a home where she is not alone too often. She really wants a home where she can be an indoor dog, but with outdoor playtime. She is scared of big dogs but loves small dogs and is very protective of them. She can easily climb a chain link fence and knows how to wiggle her way off a cable, so a privacy fence or supervised outdoor time is needed.\nD.O.B 2-11-11 Weight 47 lbs...All pets have lifetime sanctuary at Haven of the Ozarks.

He seems comfortable indoors and likely has lived in a house at some point in his old life. Jerry can jump a fence and will need a safe way to get some exercise because he's a fairly energetic dog. We were told he isn't good with cats, but Jerry spent time with our office cat and was only a little curious about him. When the kitty told him to \"\"back off,\"\" he did! As far as dog friends, Jerry can be a bit picky. He will most likely to get along with a female and a meet and greet before going home is recommended. Once Jerry makes friends with a dog, he will adore them with all his heart. He just needs the chance to pick his friend. Jerry likes the Directors six children, but won't do well with children who don't have good dog manners. We think the most important factor for Jerry is that his new parents know how to handle a confident dog like Jerry. We'd love to introduce you to this special boy, so give us a call at 417-835-3647 for more information or visit 9-4 any day of the week!

            "description": "Andrew is a young Pit Bull mix, who is very loving and full of energy. He showed up on someones doorstep, hungry and in need of some love. The resident of the home he showed up at took great care of Andrew, but Andrew was too big and energetic to be with the old terrier that already lived there. He never hurt the little dog, but did make it quite unhappy. He is now at the Haven waiting for a new home! He is accustomed to leash walks and loves to go on walks to enjoy the fresh air. He is used to living outdoors, but he would love to be a couch snuggle buddy as well. He is \"\"beautiful\"\" on car rides. We suggest he be in a home with similar sized dogs because he loves to play with them! His estimated DOB is 1/1/18, he weighs 60 pounds, and his adoption fee is $90. Andrew is micro-chipped, neutered, up to date on all shots, and heart worm negative....All pets have lifetime sanctuary at Haven of the Ozarks. If they cannot remain with their adopter, they must be returned to the Haven.\n\nAdoption fees are as follows: \nPuppies under the age of 6 months - $125\nDogs weighing 30 pounds and less - $125 \nDogs ages 6 months to 5 yrs old - $90\nDogs over the age of 5 yrs old - $75.\nCats under the age of 6 months old - $75\nCats over the age of 6 months old - $65",

If they cannot remain with their adopter, they must be returned to the Haven.\n\nAdoption fees are as follows: \nPuppies under the age of 6 months - $125\nDogs weighing 30 pounds and less - $125 \nDogs ages 6 months to 5 yrs old - $90\nDogs over the age of 5 yrs old - $75.\nCats under the age of 6 months old - $75\nCats over the age of 6 months old - $65",

She is scared and not trusting yet but we see in her eyes that she wants to believe in the true goodness of people...and so it will take a little time, but she has absolutely no aggression and with patience and TLC this girl will blossom!

She is a little pudgy but if you need a walking buddy, she could be the one!\nIf you would like to adopt this sweet furbaby, please complete our pre-qualification application at this link: https://bit.ly/2CCVFPV\n\n#AdoptDontShop #TBCAnimalRescue",

One of our long term supporters happened to find her and loaded her up to take care of her. While we initially thought that Noel was completely blind and had lost one eye, we have since detected some vision as well as a partially functioning eye behind a severely overgrown cyst. Unfortunately, Noel was initially diagnosed with cancer but she shows no sign of illness and we think it's a miracle! She LOVES LOVES LOVES every minute at TBC Animal Rescue and adores all of the staff and volunteers but she deserves a home! She likes to walk on the leash and she absolutely adores belly rubs. We would love for Noel to find an adopter of even a loving foster home where she could live out her life and receive the tender care she so deserves.\nIf you would like to adopt this sweet furbaby, please complete our pre-qualification application at this link: https://bit.ly/2CCVFPV\n\n#AdoptDontShop #TBCAnimalRescue",

Buddy has been at the Rescue for a while now and even though we all love him to pieces - he really wants to find a loving furever home. Buddy enjoys nice walks and to cool off in one of our ponds. That's the way to make it through this Texas summer, he says. He loves to play tug with a rope toy, plays with a football, loves to walk on a leash and go in our woods to play. He is a great dog, and will be a terrific protector of his home and family. He is a playful boy with a medium amount of energy and gives sweet kisses too. Buddy has a slight food aggression. This can often be controlled with separate areas for feeding in a home but at the rescue we free feed so Buddy lives alone. Pls. come visit our lonely boy and give him some lovin'! This will be a great dog for a single girl that wants to feel protected and have a great companion and jogging buddy...\nIf you would like to adopt this sweet furbaby, please complete our pre-qualification application at this link: https://bit.ly/2CCVFPV\n\n#AdoptDontShop #TBCAnimalRescue",

It took LG a little while to warm up to people but he is on his way. He now walks on the leash and is trusting people, much due to the work of our volunteers. LG is Kacina's brother and is looking for a loving family that will provide him the love he so desperately deserves.

Allan got out and drug his buddy out of the road to save this boy's life. Hero then stood guard over him on the side of the road but was safer. Allan worked with the landowner to feed him and try to befriend him. Hero was having nothing to do with leaving his friend. Allan had to trap him to save his life, and now he is a big galoof. \n\n He walks well on a leash, and loves the girls that volunteer... his lives with silk and is now protective of her now, but would also adapt to protect your family.\n\n Hero lives up to his name and we are proud to care for him until his forever family find him !\nIf you would like to adopt this sweet furbaby, please complete our pre-qualification application at this link: https://bit.ly/2CCVFPV\n\n#AdoptDontShop #TBCAnimalRescue",

But so far, she prefers to be an only dog. They may have been mean to her or she just likes to be an only child. It took awhile for her to feel comfortable and gain her trust. She smiles and loves to go for a walk. She is gentle on a leash and is super sweet. She will be shy with strangers but loves people once she gets to know you. She is ready to walk whenever you are and is ready to go home with you! She has been with us WAY too long!

He is a staff favorite and loves to walk on the leash as well. He is affectionate once he gets to know you and loyalty is his nature. He was born around September of 2015.\n\nCharlie was living with a homeless man that eventually found a place to live that did not allow dogs. Thankfully one of our supporters found out about him and brought him to us.\n\nCharlie is typical Heeler, he wants to be a family dog but tends to bond best with one man/one woman. They often do not tolerate strangers and will guard his family well. He is housetrained and prefers to live with a girl dog for best harmony.\nIf you would like to adopt this sweet furbaby, please complete our pre-qualification application at this link: https://bit.ly/2CCVFPV\n\n#AdoptDontShop #TBCAnimalRescue",

We had to trap her to save her life. She is full grown now and is between 40 to 50 lbs. It has been a long road of socialization but Cherokee wants to please and is so anxious to be loved. She now walks on a leash and is now ready for the next stage in her life- a permanent and loving home. We had some 6th graders visit and she loved their attention. She has her wings now and is ready to fly off to a new adventure. Giving her a home will be the most awesome experience. From feral to family friendly....that is a great success story already and you can help write her next chapter.\nIf you would like to adopt this sweet furbaby, please complete our pre-qualification application at this link: https://bit.ly/2CCVFPV\n\n#AdoptDontShop #TBCAnimalRescue",

She is the sweetest girl with a heart of gold with people but she prefers to be an only child. We have never seen any aggression from her with people. She is a strong girl, and has gotten a little plump so she needs an experienced handler. She is a delightful girl just waiting to love and be loved. She had little hope in the city shelter but we want her to have a forever family. Please consider making a difference in the life of a special animal today. Brooke might be your best dog ever! Brooke is spayed, and microchipped, up to date on all vaccinations and ready to go home with you. We did not think she would accept another dog, but recently she lived with Smokey until he was adopted so pls. bring your dog for a meet and greet.\nIf you would like to adopt this sweet furbaby, please complete our pre-qualification application at this link: https://bit.ly/2CCVFPV\n\n#AdoptDontShop #TBCAnimalRescue",

            "description": "Buddy Ray is about 12 years old now , and has gorgeous amber eyes and a very soft coat. \n He has the Lab personality but a bit of the Chow fur. He is about 50 lbs. and full grown. He is shy at first, and fearful of a leash but will warm up when you give him a chance, and wants to be your friend. He is neutered and likely house trained... everyone tells us our dogs are housebroken because they are used to living outdoors, We have heard it so many times, we have come to believe it-especially when they are neutered at an early age like he was. \nBuddy Ray is one of those dogs that we think will blossom when you get him home, and is ready to be your great family dog! He gets along with the 2 girls he lives with, and is not rambunctious... but is playful.\nIf you would like to adopt this sweet furbaby, please complete our pre-qualification application at this link: https://bit.ly/2CCVFPV\n\n#AdoptDontShop #TBCAnimalRescue",

Which means I'm a very strong independent lady, so being an only dog would be ideal but not I might be okay with one laidback friend. We would just have to meet first to make sure we like each other. It takes a while to earn my trust but once you have it, I will love you forever! I love to play and run around the yard. Sometimes I sound scary and people think I'm mean but really, I just have a tough exterior. I guess that makes me a good protector though. I love being outside in a fenced yard to just hang out in the nice weather. I have not been in house, so I will need some training on manners, but I am a quick learner! What I am trying to say is, I need a forever home with someone extra patience who can teach me how to relax and enjoy the little things in life.",

            "description": "Moon is a shy 1 year old old lab mix.\n\n(Moon is required to go to a home with other dogs, this is where she finds her confidence)\n\n Her and her sister Shyne are looking for their forever homes! Moon and Shyne are 2 VERY SHY misunderstood pups who are looking for someone patient to help them learn it is ok to trust a human. \nMoon can be withdrawn and nervous at first, but it doesn't take long for her to break out of her shell. She loves other dogs, (of all sizes) and will tire them out with play. Moon also gets along with cats and kittens! \nMoon recognizes her name when called. She is not used to a leash but responds well to training. She is 90% housebroken, keep some pee pads available just in case. If you take her out upon walking, after meals, and before bed..she will \"\"hold\"\" it until she is outside. Her nerves can get to her when traveling, but she is starting to get the hang of the car rides! Squeaky toys and bones keep Moon busy when kenneled, and she is easy to kennel. \nAt bedtime, Moon will gladly go inside her kennel and will sleep throughout the night. Mood does not bark a lot, she tends to be on the quite side. Moon is really a blank slate and there is a big world out there!! All she needs is an opportunity and a loving home to become your new BFF!! \n\nThese sweet pups will NOT be available at our adoption event this coming Saturday at the Fort Collins Petco 2211 S. College Ave from 10am-1pm, but are available for one on one meet and greets throughout the week. If you are interested in these pups, please submit an application through our website aaanimalrescue.org. Please feel free to email with any questions allaboardanimalrescue@gmail.com.\n\n\nBreed and size disclosure: As a rescue all of our dogs come to us from high-kill shelters or other rescues, so we do not get a lot of background or information on these dogs. We occasionally receive the mother with the puppies, but in most cases both parents are unknown. Because of this we do not know the full breeding of the dogs. We are required to list the dogs based on the breeds provided to us on their records, but they are all mixed breeds as far as we know, and we cannot guarantee the actual breeds of any of these dogs. Since the full breeding of the dogs is unknown we can also only give you an educated guess on the full-grown size of the dogs. All of the current information we have on the dogs is listed in their bio above. More information may be available at our adoption event, since a lot of the fosters turn in report cards on how the dog has done in their care when they drop them off. \n\nAdoption Process: If you are interested in adopting from us, the first step of our adoption process is to fill out an application online at http://aaanimalrescue.org/adoption_app.html. It takes us 24-48 hours to process your application and get back to you, via email. Applications turned in Friday afternoon or Saturday morning will not be processed since we are preparing for or at our adoption event. We do have applications on site at our events, but are not always able to approve them at that time and many of the dogs will already have holds on them, so we suggest you fill out an application prior to attending an adoption event. We can place a hold on one dog per approved applicant after a deposit fee has been received, please do not ask to hold a dog if you have not turned in an application and been approved, for the first hour of our adoption event, so that they can get the first chance to meet and hopefully adopt that dog. After the first hour of the event all dogs are available on a first come, first serve basis. If you already have an approved application on file, there will just be more paperwork and the adoption fee at the event, but you will be able to take home the dog/puppy that day. Since we are foster based and do not have a location, our dogs are only available to meet at our events, unless otherwise noted.",

He needs an educated owner who can slowly get to know him by visiting and helping ease his fear of new visitors. He would do best with no cats and some female dogs. He is dog selective. He would do best with a single person who would allow him to live in the home and bond with him. Tip is a quirky fella who needs a special match.",

When brought in, he was very emaciated and we learned one of his legs was in need of treatment. He has undergone several months of intensive physical therapy and now walks with barely a limp! Tim is very even-tempered and happy. He loves every human he meets and wants to play with every dog he sees. He is crate trained, cat-safe, has taken basic obedience and is an all-around wonderful dog.\nPlease note: We only accept adoption applications through our website or in person (Facebook and Petfinder inquiries are not considered applications).",

Daisy would be VERY protective of her Mom. Daisy needs a fenced yard for her security to stretch, run, play and lay out in the sun. Because she loves the attention from her owner Daisy needs to be an only pet. Due to her rough play we would recommend no children.\n\nDaisy is a pitbull terrier about 4 years old. She is heartworm positive but is on treatment with Doxycycline and Moxidectin. She weighs 58 pounds. Daisy was abandoned at the shelter in November of 2017 with her litter of 8 puppies.

Ellie was one of the most neglected dogs we've ever taken in. She was emaciated, had almost no hair left and was in a tremendous amount of pain. After getting medical treatment, Ellie went to a foster with a male dog playmate. She loved her foster and became protective of the family. Who could blame her? When you've been treated as badly as she was, you would want to protect anyone who was being nice to you. \n\nEllie has now learned her boundaries and when \"\"GSD protection mode\"\" is appropriate. Can you be the angel this girl wants and deserves? Ellie would love a home as an only dog, or with a large male who is laid back. She loves to play ball and go for walks. She needs to continue her socialization training and it's a requirement of her adoption that the new owner will participate in training sessions. Ellie will not be good for a home with small dogs or cats and due to her prey drive, we will not put her in a home with young children either. Ellie would be perfect for someone who has time to work on her training and who is experienced with German shepherds and their protection instincts. Ellie is house-trained and crate-trained.To apply for adoption, go to www.caninepetrescue.com and fill out our online adoption application. You will see answers to many of your questions in the introductory information.",

Sadly, this very much limits the number of homes out there for him. He has been with us for a very long time.\n\nDogs are generally tested with dogs of their own size; and dog meets with the resident dogs are always encouraged. Our cat test should be used as a general purpose screening only to rule out overt aggression; we always recommend caution when introducing dogs to cats in the home. Recommendation on suitability of placement with children by their ages is based on behavioral observations including energy level and response to body handling.

She's very energetic and pulls quite hard on leash. She does well with some but not all dogs and does best with male dogs. She would do best in a home with an experienced owner willing to provide lots of exercise, playtime and some basic training. \n\nDogs are generally tested with dogs of their own size; and dog meets with the resident dogs are always encouraged. Our cat test should be used as a general purpose screening only to rule out overt aggression; we always recommend caution when introducing dogs to cats in the home. Recommendation on suitability of placement with children by their ages is based on behavioral observations including energy level and response to body handling. We never recommend leaving young children unsupervised with dogs, and we cannot guarantee the behavior of dogs with children, other pets or cats. Behavior evaluations should be considered as a snapshot of the behavior of the dog at this point in time; SCPR believes all dog families need to be prepared to invest time and energy into training as well as provide common sense management of their new dog. We always encourage family to do some research on the breeds or mixes of breeds prior to adoption as many can have some unique characteristics that may or may not fit into their families.

Zeke is a nervous fellow when you first meet him but will warm up to you if you are just patient and slow. We're not sure what happened to him before he arrived at the shelter, but initially he was terrified of everyone who came near him. He does seem to get along well with female dogs, we have not tested him with cats. He's about 1 to 2 years old.\n\nDogs are generally tested with dogs of their own size; and dog meets with the resident dogs are always encouraged. Our cat test should be used as a general purpose screening only to rule out overt aggression; we always recommend caution when introducing dogs to cats in the home. Recommendation on suitability of placement with children by their ages is based on behavioral observations including energy level and response to body handling. We never recommend leaving young children unsupervised with dogs, and we cannot guarantee the behavior of dogs with children, other pets or cats.

            "description": "Little Man is a 3 to 5-year-old pitbull mix he's been waiting a long time to find his family. In his kennel, this guy has lots of energy and can be quite vocal but is a very different dog ones outside kennel. He's happy to meet people when they stop by his kennel for a visit. He likes to go for walks and although initially he will pull only she does settle nicely once out walking. When hanging out in the yard he's quite independent and not a needy, all over you kind of dog. He'll stop by and check in with you, and then gets right back to exploring his environment. He was well behaved but wiggly during physical exam. He was not particularly food motivated nor did he respond to any commitments. Little Man does well with some dogs, but all times and definitely prefers females over males. He definitely prefers to be the one in charge; he would not do well with another dog trying to boss him around. Because he is dog selective, adult meet ahead of adoption would be a must. he is not a fan of cats, so a kitty free home is necessary. We think this guy would do well in the home with family looking for a dog with moderate energy and prepared to do some initial training. Because he has been in the shelter for so long, it's going to take a while for this guy to decompress and learn appropriate household behaviors. We think he's probably best suited to be in a home with children 10 years of age and older.\n\nDogs are generally tested with dogs of their own size; and dog meets with the resident dogs are always encouraged. Our cat test should be used as a general purpose screening only to rule out overt aggression; we always recommend caution when introducing dogs to cats in the home. Recommendation on suitability of placement with children by their ages is based on behavioral observations including energy level and response to body handling. We never recommend leaving young children unsupervised with dogs, and we cannot guarantee the behavior of dogs with children, other pets or cats. Behavior evaluations should be considered as a snapshot of the behavior of the dog at this point in time; SCPR believes all dog families need to be prepared to invest time and energy into training as well as provide common sense management of their new dog. We always encourage family to do some research on the breeds or mixes of breeds prior to adoption as many can have some unique characteristics that may or may not fit into their families. For more information about this dog or any others at our Shelter, please visit www.doitforthedogs.com. We are the Second Chance Pet Rescue in Grove, OK. 918-786-7630.

Bernadette had a rough start to life and was originally found as a stray with chemical burns on her body. We treated her and she healed wonderfully, but she's still weary of new people, especially men. She went to stay with a foster home for a while, but unfortunately never warmed up to the man in the home. She would be best in a quiet, patient home without children. Bernadette can be a bit bossy with other dogs, but given time can warm up to them. If you think you might be the one to give this dog a second chance in life, please fill out an application on our website www.chicoanimalshelter.orgThis animal is at the City of Chico Animal Shelter.

I can be very scared in situations and with new people, but once I have time to warm up, I'm a loyal and protective companion. My ideal home would be in a more rural location so I don't have to worry too much about neighbors coming by and scaring me, or me scaring them when I bark. Ideally, I would like to live with an adult woman or couple who don't have any children or many visitors. If you think I sound like I could be your match, please call the shelter at 530-894-5630 and to ask for more information.This animal is at the City of Chico Animal Shelter. Please call 530-894-5630",

Once animals (especially puppies & kittens) are posted, we immediately begin receiving adoption applications. Adoption appointments are scheduled first come, first served. (See our adoption procedures below.)\n\nSteele deserves a medal for being a volunteer and staff favorite! He loves playing in our dog parks but would rather have a home of his own with a yard. Steele needs daily exercise, so an active family would be a plus. Ask staff if you'd like to meet Steele outside in a dog park. He'll show you a good time! Steele's estimated DOB is 6/1/14. He weighs approximately 47 pounds and is done growing.\n\nSteele was generously sponsored by Patty Snipes during our virtual Reigning Cats and Dogs event. Thank you Patty for sponsoring Steele!\n\nHSPC's adoption fee is seventy-five-dollars through December 31, 2020, unless stated otherwise within the pet's description. At times, our adoption fees are lowered during special events that are posted to our website or Facebook page. Every pet that is available for adoption has been spayed/neutered, microchipped, and is up-to-date on vaccinations including heartworm preventative (canines). Adopters are required to schedule a wellness exam with their veterinarian at their cost within 7 days of adoption.\n\nPlease only submit one application. Once you are contacted by email, you will have an opportunity to provide us with any additional animal(s) under consideration.",

With one volunteer available to review all applications, we ask for your patience waiting for an email response. While we are closed to the public, we will only be responding to pet inquiries that accompany an application. Adoption appointments are scheduled first come with approved application, first served. (See our adoption procedures below.)\n\nFreckles has the cutest freckled face! She is a sweet girl, once she gets to know you. Freckles likes to run around the dog park but is just as happy having quiet time with her favorite person(s). Freckles has been diagnosed with early renal disease and is on a prescription diet to control it. Prior to adoption, you will be required to have a veterinarian who must consult with our shelter's vet. Freckle's estimated DOB is 1/1/2013; she weighs approx 48 lbs.\n\nFreckles was generously sponsored by Carol Blann during our virtual Reigning Cats and Dogs event. Thank you Carol for sponsoring Freckles!\n\nHSPC's adoption fee is seventy-five-dollars through December 31, 2020, unless stated otherwise within the pet's description. At times, our adoption fees are lowered during special events that are posted to our website or Facebook page. Every pet that is available for adoption has been spayed/neutered, microchipped, and is up-to-date on vaccinations including heartworm preventative (canines). Adopters are required to schedule a wellness exam with their veterinarian at their cost within 7 days of adoption.\n\nPlease only submit one application. Once you are contacted by email, you will have an opportunity to provide us with any additional animal(s) under consideration.",

He came to the HSPC in 2015 after being found as a stray. Justin is a friendly dog who would make a great addition to any active family. He is smart and very trainable. He already knows how to sit, lay down and roll over and will pretty much do anything for treats! Justin is a strong active boy who will need a yard with a privacy fence where he will be able to get plenty of exercise. Please ask to meet Justin outside of his kennel.
